Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>Carnevale in Venice, Italy finished last Sunday. The most visible
<br>
aspect was ~70,000 people (one-third of normal years, tho) flocking
<br>
towards Piazza San Marco, while a few hundred locals and foreigners
<br>
preened and exhibited themselves for the tourists' cameras. Noone
<br>
knew who were these few hundred exhibiting creatures because the
<br>
elaborate costumes masked the humans inside. That was the original
<br>
intent of Carnevale after all: intrigue, mystery, and fun, while you
<br>
danced, gambled and lewdly frolic'd, anonymously.
<br>
<p>These days the outward show of Carnevale remains, but much more
<br>
sedately, while the real Venice continues underneath the surface.
<br>
The real Venice is between the cracks, in the canals, on the
<br>
opposite faces of the palaces on the Grand Canal, in the gondolas,
<br>
hanging from a clothesline stretched between two buildings, colored
<br>
decaying pinks, greens, and browns. There, you hear a different
<br>
rhymthm, smell the frowst of the sea, and become lost in the
<br>
fog-shrouded labrynth of narrow alleys and walking bridges.
<br>
<p>(Here I think shows the Real Venice)
<br>
<a href="http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/cgi-bin/awimage?dir=2001/0815&amp;article=building_1">http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/cgi-bin/awimage?dir=2001/0815&amp;article=building_1</a><br>

<br>
<p>Venice is built on a series of swampy islands at the edge of the
<br>
Adriatic Sea
<br>
<a href="http://www.geographical.co.uk/maps/factfiles/venice.html">http://www.geographical.co.uk/maps/factfiles/venice.html</a>
<br>
with man's ingenuity driving its development. Townfolk fled to the
<br>
Lagoon in the fifth century for refuge from barbarian attackers, and
<br>
remained there when they discovered that their refuge could supply
<br>
fish and salt. The Venetian builders evolved construction techniques
<br>
unique and customized to the swampy terrain. Into the compacted clay
<br>
and sand of the swamp, timber pinewood piles were driven, which
<br>
didn't rot, because there was no free oxygen available for microbes
<br>
in the closely-packed piles. On top of that, was a layer of bricks,
<br>
then another layer of marble, to create a damp-proof foundation for
<br>
the houses and palaces. With that as the foundation, the city was not
<br>
built entirely from scratch, but was also constructed from remnants
<br>
of ruined cities. Roman bricks were taken from villas on the
<br>
mainland, and arches and statues were taken from churches and
<br>
palaces. Venice also raided Byzantium for material to adorn its
<br>
facades.
<br>
<p>=========
<br>
Venice's relation to its embedded water level have not remained
<br>
stable however. It has sunk by about 7.5cm a century for the past
<br>
1,000 years, and the rate is speeding up. It is both sinking, and
<br>
the water level is rising. The mean level of the land has lowered by
<br>
9 inches (23 centimeters) relative to sea level. At the same time,
<br>
the tidal level has increased by some 3 inches (8 centimeters) for
<br>
several reasons, including organic structure growth on the barrier
<br>
reef in the lagoon basin and changes in atmospheric pressure and
<br>
wind action on the Adriatic Sea.
<br>
<p>Plans to hold back the tides.

=========
<br>
<p>The rhythm of the real Venice can best be experienced from the
<br>
gondola, a boat unique to Venice.
<br>
<a href="http://www.venetia.it/boats/gondola.jpg">http://www.venetia.it/boats/gondola.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>The shape of Venice is reflected in the shape of the gondola, and
<br>
the boat's evolution reflected the growth of the city, as well.
<br>
<a href="http://www.venetia.it/boats/gond_eng.htm">http://www.venetia.it/boats/gond_eng.htm</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.squero.com/historyofthegondola.htm">http://www.squero.com/historyofthegondola.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The gondola is greater than 11 m long, it weighs about 400 kg, it is
<br>
built using (at least) nine different types of wood (beech, cherry,
<br>
elm, fir, larch, lime, mahogany, oak, walnut), and the degree of
<br>
curvature is based on the weight of the gondolier. It is shaped
<br>
asymmetrically, with a flat bottom that is tilted with respect to
<br>
the water:
<br>
<a href="http://www.gondolavenezia.it/storia.asp?Pag=6">http://www.gondolavenezia.it/storia.asp?Pag=6</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.squero.com/howaregondolasmade.htm">http://www.squero.com/howaregondolasmade.htm</a>
<br>
The asymmetrical shape counteracts the force of the oar, otherwise
<br>
the oaring on the right side would make the boat go around in
<br>
circles! Originally they were colored black because of the tar to
<br>
make them watertight, but then people started decorating them and
<br>
they became more and more ornate. Then in 1562, such displays of
<br>
wealth were banned, and black remained the standard color again.
<br>
<p>In addition to the flatbottom-tilt, the boat reflects more features
<br>
of Venice. The rostrum in the front of a gondola ('ferro de prua')
<br>
<a href="http://www.venetia.it/boats/piafero.jpg">http://www.venetia.it/boats/piafero.jpg</a>
<br>
has the shape of Doge's hat, six fingers for the six districts of
<br>
Venice ('sestieri'), one finger in the opposite direction (the
<br>
'Giudecca' island). Another piece of the boat, the rowlock ('forcola'),
<br>
<a href="http://www.squero.com/forcola.jpg">http://www.squero.com/forcola.jpg</a>
<br>
can hold the oar in (at least) five different positions. It's a piece
<br>
of art.
<br>
<p>=========
<br>
Man, scaled, is reflected in a macrocosmic state in Venice. The
<br>
Renaissance was triggered, in part, by a revival of Greek ideas. As
<br>
the Greeks often designed their buildings based on the proportions
<br>
of one part of the human body to another, so did the Italian
<br>
humanists. The Renaissance artists didn't want to just recreate
<br>
again, what the Greeks accomplished. Instead, the Renaissance people
<br>
wanted to build on those ancient ideas and then take those ideas
<br>
further into new directions. Leonardo da Vinci ('Leonardo from
<br>
Vinci') accomplished exactly that, with his Vitruvian Man.

<br>

<br>
<p>Leonardo was inspired by Vitruvius, De Architectura, and created a
<br>
drawing that provided a key link between ancient Greek architecture
<br>
and his time. This simple figure became a symbol for the Renaissance
<br>
and western civilization, so much so, that it is now on the backside
<br>
of the Italian 1Euro coin.

<br>
THE PLANNING OF TEMPLES
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.aiwaz.net/Leonardo/index.htm">http://www.aiwaz.net/Leonardo/index.htm</a>
<br>
{begin quote}
<br>
1. The  planning of temples depends upon asymmetry: and  the method
<br>
of  this architects must diligently apprehend.  It  arises  from
<br>
proportion  (which in Greek  is called analogia). [...] For without
<br>
symmetry  and  proportion no  temple  can  have  a regular  plan;
<br>
that  is,  it  must  have an exact proportion  worked  out after
<br>
the  fashion  of the members of  a  finely-shaped human  body.
<br>
2. For Nature has  so planned the human body that the face from the
<br>
chin to  the top of  the forehead and the roots of the hair is a
<br>
tenth part; also the palm of the  hand from the  wrist to the  top
<br>
of the middle finger  is as much;  the head from  the chin to the
<br>
crown,  an eighth part;  from the top of the breast with  the bottom
<br>
&nbsp;of the  neck to the  roots of the hair,  a sixth part;  from the
<br>
middle of the breast to the crown, a fourth  part; a  third part of
<br>
the height of  the face is from  the bottom of the chin to  the
<br>
bottom of  the nostrils; the nose from the bottom  of  the nostrils
<br>
to  the line  between the brows, as much;  from that line to the
<br>
roots of the hair, the forehead  is given as the third part. The
<br>
foot  is  a sixth  of the height of  the body; the cubit  a quarter
<br>
, the breast  also  a quarter. [...] 3. In  like  fashion the
<br>
members  of  temples ought  to  have dimensions of their  several
<br>
parts  answering  suitably  to  the general sum of their whole
<br>
magnitude. Now the navel is naturally the exact centre of the body.
<br>
For if a man lies on his back with hands and feet outspread, and the
<br>
centre  of a circle is placed on his navel, his  figure   and  toes
<br>
will  be  touched  by  the circumference.   Also   a   square  will
<br>
be  found described within the figure, in the  same way as a round
<br>
figure is  produced. For if  we measure from the  sole of the  foot
<br>
to the top  of the head, and apply  the measure  to the
<br>
outstretched hands, the breadth will be  found equal  to the
<br>
height, just like sites  which are squared by rule.

Leonardo, as he is almost always called, was trained to be a
<br>
painter. But his interests and achievements spread into an
<br>
astonishing variety of fields that are now considered scientific
<br>
specialties. Leonardo studied anatomy, astronomy, botany, geology,
<br>
geometry, and optics, and he designed machines and drew plans for
<br>
hundreds of inventions. Because Leonardo excelled in such an amazing
<br>
number of areas of human knowledge, he is often called a universal
<br>
genius. However, he had little interest in literature, history, or
<br>
religion. He formulated a few scientific laws, but he never
<br>
developed his ideas systematically. Leonardo was most of all an
<br>
excellent observer. He concerned himself with what the eye could
<br>
see, rather than with purely abstract concepts.

<br>
<p><p>Now, a little story for you from  the above site 'Wierdo Leonardo'.
<br>
<p>_Leonardo and Michelangelo_
<br>
<p>There was said to be some animosity between these two artists.
<br>
Michelangelo is reported to have said of Leonardo that &quot;He cannot
<br>
create, only imagine.&quot;
<br>
<p>This anecdote was told by the writer known as Anonimo
<br>
Magliabecchiano about an incident in 1503: &quot;One day, Leonardo,
<br>
strolling in the company of Giovanni di Gavina de Santa Trinita,
<br>
walked past the benches of the Spini Palace, where a group of
<br>
gentlemen where discussing a passage from Dante.  They called to
<br>
da Vinci and begged him to explain it to them.  At that moment,
<br>
Michelangelo also happened to pass, and Leonardo told them:
<br>
'Michelangelo will explain it to you.'  Michelangelo answered
<br>
angrily, thinking that Leonardo was making fun of him: 'Explain it
<br>
yourself, you who made a design for a horse to be cast in bronze
<br>
and, unable to cast it, abandoned it, to your shame.' Leonardo
<br>
remained silent and blushed.  To embarass him more, Michelangelo
<br>
called after him: 'And those Milanese idiots believed you!'&quot;
<br>

<br>
Amara (with some gondolieric and Italian pointers by Serafino)
<br>
<p>Ciao!  (a Venetian word, means 'your servant' (servo vostro))
