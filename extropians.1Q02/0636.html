</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  Since the sun has not expanded into a red giant, it is not fusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helium yet, let alone heavier elements.  Also, iron is NOT fusable.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know if it is not fusable at all, or if it is just not fusable in the

</em><br>
<p>You can fuse iron atoms, but the reaction is endothermic. So when this
<br>
happens, the star core cools. There are other nuclear processes
<br>
involving iron too, and all are endothermic and hence tend to cool the
<br>
star, causing it to compress. 
<br>
<p>We better learn to use iron for nanomachines, because that is what we
<br>
are going to end up with. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also would like to know what &quot;strange xenon&quot; is, as opposed to &quot;normal

<p><a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2000/pdf/5230.pdf">http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2000/pdf/5230.pdf</a> : 
<br>
<p>WHAT IS ISOTOPICALLY STRANGE XENON? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Heymann, Department of Geology and Geophysics, Rice University, Houston TX, USA.
<br>
<p>Isotopically strange xenon (ISX) is strongly enriched in the p- and
<br>
r-isotopes relative to solar and terrestrial xenon [1]. However, these
<br>
`excess' components have never been separated from one another, nor have
<br>
they ever been made free of s-components. It was argued that the excess
<br>
p- and r- components had formed in supernovae and had been ion-
<br>
implanted into nanodiamonds [2]. It is argued here that ISX with the
<br>
smallest observed 130 Xe/ 136 Xe is a fundamental galactic Xe gas which
<br>
formed when p- and r-, and s- components were cycled through C-rich
<br>
stars and implanted into diamonds with kinetic energies on the order of
<br>
1 keV in stellar winds.
