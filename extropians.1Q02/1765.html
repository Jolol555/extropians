<p>I didn't say it was `a meaningless question', I said it wasn't a question
<br>
at all, it was just a string of words that misleadingly resembled one. That
<br>
doesn't mean it mightn't provoke a thoughtful person into considering some
<br>
interesting and even important issues. 
<br>
<p>For example, in the light of evolutionary explanations it seems obvious
<br>
that we *can* sensibly ask `what is the purpose of the liver?' without
<br>
implying that any *person* or *volitional agent* intended that biological
<br>
purpose. Most living sub-structures really do have a teleological aspect.
<br>
It's just that this can't possibly apply to life per se--the abstraction,
<br>
or the totality of living things--let alone the universe as a whole.
<br>
<p>But I do think it's important to admit that some syntagmata ending with a
<br>
question mark are really not true questions. `When did you stop beating
<br>
your wife?' when addressed prosecutorially to an unmarried woman *looks*
<br>
like a question, but it can't be, since it admits of no conceivable answer.
<br>
When addressed to a married man who has never beaten his wife...? I'm not
<br>
sure, but I have my doubts about it *qua* question (if we agree to accept
<br>
Gricean principles of conversational implicature and communicative fairness
<br>
as a necessary basis for discourse).
