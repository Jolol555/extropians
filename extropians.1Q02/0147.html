In V6#364 &quot;Some US observations &amp; notes&quot; Brian D Williams said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Here in Chicago, handguns are completely illegal and have been for 20 years
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>By the logic of the antigun folks, Chicago should by now be completely free
<br>
of handguns and violent crimes like murder should be non-existent. The fact
<br>
is that there are millions of handguns in the Chicago, 650+ murders this
<br>
year, and gun related crime is an everyday occurrence in certain
<br>
neighbourhoods.
<br>
<p>Yet the fact is (as any prosecutor here can tell you) is that the first
<br>
thing that happens when an offender gets brought to court is that the
<br>
weapons charges are usually dropped and the case is plea bargained.&quot;
<br>
<p>Brian, I can think of a few reasons why Chicago's crime situation is so bad.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Whilst the availability of guns in Chicago has become more
<br>
difficult, it is no difficulty for a determined individual, particularly a
<br>
criminal, to simply cross state lines &amp; purchase a gun in a state with more
<br>
lax ownership &amp; sales restrictions. Gun restrictions will only really work
<br>
if they are applied on a federal (or better yet international) level.
<br>
Piece-meal approaches to gun restriction only seem to favour those who will
<br>
use such weapons for nefarious purposes. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	The current US system of plea-bargaining seems to favour the
<br>
more hardened criminal. Example: a street level dealer (or &quot;runner&quot;) is
<br>
arrested. It is highly unlikely that he will have worthwhile information on
<br>
his superiors &amp; it is unlikely that he will be able to effect much change in
<br>
his charges by plea bargaining. Someone higher up the chain is arrested &amp;
<br>
because they have more details on the overall supply system, they can
<br>
effectively plea bargain a more serious supply charge away in exchange for
<br>
that information. This is one of the reasons that the majority of people in
<br>
jail for drug offences (for example) are in for relatively minor offences
<br>
(mandatory &quot;3 strikes&quot; sentencing doesn't help much either), &amp; the big
<br>
sharks are still out in the community, doing maximum harm. 
<br>
<p>I cannot claim to know what the best solution to the guns/crime problem in
<br>
the US. The issues involved are difficult, the pressure from various
<br>
interest groups so intense &amp; the size of the problem so large, that no easy
<br>
solution presents itself. To my mind the gun availability issue plays a
<br>
major role in the problems that the US faces, however it is only one of many
<br>
issues that will need to be addressed if the US is to curb the horrific rate
<br>
of  violent crime that afflicts the majority of the united states.
