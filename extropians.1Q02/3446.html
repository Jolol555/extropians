<p>I just tried this game.  I took one hit and bit one bullet.  The bullet was 
<br>
bit because I said that evolution was essentially true, which the site 
<br>
decided meant that I thought it was certainly true, therefore my request 
<br>
for certain proof of God was irrational.  I deny this, so I bit the bullet 
<br>
and said I demanded more proof, which is the only option the site gives you 
<br>
since you can't argue with their premises or THEIR logic.
<br>
<p>I took the hit because I said any being that could be called God should 
<br>
have the ability to do anything, but later denied that they could square a 
<br>
circle.  Obviously this hinges on one's notion of &quot;anything&quot;.
<br>
<p>This site is puerile and its logic questionable.  I had no trouble with the 
<br>
Loch Ness monster question but it does not logically follow that lack of 
<br>
proof equals non-existence.  Most of you skeptical types have a lot of 
<br>
trouble with that logic, as I know well from my past interest in 
<br>
UFOs.  However, in the case of God, the argument - as stated by Mike Siegel 
<br>
on Coast-to-Coast AM one night - that since you can't prove God does not 
<br>
exists somewhere in the universe, that means you cannot say that he does 
<br>
not exist.  This reduces the notion to stating that no matter what fanciful 
<br>
concept I may come up, if I cannot prove it does not exist by an exhaustive 
<br>
search of the universe, I must accept that it does exist.  This is not the 
<br>
case.  I can just as easily and correctly turn this around and say that if 
<br>
the only place I can prove something exists is in my own mind, then it is 
<br>
reasonable to conclude that it does not exist, in the absence of any other 
<br>
evidence.  The Loch Ness Monster and UFOS do NOT fit this criteria - there 
<br>
IS actual evidence (however weak or strong one may analyze it to be) - it 
<br>
is not merely a concept.  There is NO direct evidence for the existence of 
<br>
God - and a good deal of historical, cultural, and psychological evidence 
<br>
that the entire concept of God is based on human need to deal with the fear 
<br>
of death.
<br>
<p>I was pleased to see, however, that the site recognized that my overall 
<br>
stance on these matters was remarkably consistent.  I was amused to see 
<br>
them state that my stance seemed to depend on attitudes that most other 
<br>
people would consider strange :-}  Found out as a Transhuman again!
