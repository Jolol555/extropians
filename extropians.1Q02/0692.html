<p><p><em>&gt;Yet among the deaf community the issue is highly troublesome.  The main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue is that the deaf see themselves as a separate group with a separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, almost like an ethnic or religious group.  They have their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language (ASL) and their own customs, and face common challenges.  Deaf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people often marry other deaf people.  They are bound tightly together.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But all this is defined by their handicap.  Giving a child hearing means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they will no longer be part of their community.  They may learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ASL but they won't really need it to survive.  They won't face the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same challenges and problems.  They will not be part of the culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the deaf parents faced with the question of getting their child a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cochlear implant, they face the loss of their child from their culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>So what?  This is precisely what happens in any relatively 
<br>
isolated culture when the kids have a way and interest in moving 
<br>
on or the outside world breaks through the barriers.  How can we 
<br>
as parents want anything less than the best possible for our 
<br>
children even if it will result from them moving away and being 
<br>
too different from us for our relationship to be comfortable?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is possible that this may be a precursor to some of the biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements which will become possible in future decades.  If you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, would you take steps to make your child transhuman, if it meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you would lose the child from your culture?  Suppose you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give him some kind of ESP implant and allow them to join in a communal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, for example?  He might abandon the use of speech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begin to act in ways which you could never hope to emulate, sharing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions from other enhanced individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>As long as I knew the steps were safe and effective and 
<br>
particularly if the child was of an age to understand and 
<br>
consent, then you bet I would.  In a heartbeat.  I would also 
<br>
encourage any and all of my circle of people who might for some 
<br>
reason be capable of or desire to change in ways that made them 
<br>
not part of my circle to do so.  Would I have some mixed 
<br>
feelings and sense of loss?  Sure.  But why would I think those 
<br>
feelings and avoiding them were more important than the growth 
<br>
and fullest well-being of these others I profess to care so 
<br>
deeply about?   Of course, I would work my butt off to make sure 
<br>
the ESP implant could also work for those who grew up without it!
