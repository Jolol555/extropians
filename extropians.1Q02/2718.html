Like any routing problem, this is only useful if the cost of the more
<br>
sophisticated routing algorithms are cheaper than the cost of additional
<br>
bandwidth (streets and highways in this case.) My area of expertise is
<br>
routing in data networks. In data networks, even the crudest algorithms
<br>
work perfectly well when the traffic is at 50% of the available
<br>
bandwidth, And even the best theoretical algorithm cannot achieve 95%
<br>
utilization with acceptable performance. In most data networks it
<br>
is cheaper to build extra capacity than it is to deploy better routing
<br>
algorithms. The reason the Internet works at all is that its core is
<br>
massively underutilized.
<br>
<p><p>My original question (which I communicated poorly) was more specifically 
<br>
about the capacity of the human brain - a possible relationship between 
<br>
cost-effectiveness of extra capacity and the capacity of the human brain 
<br>
compared with the amount actively (or consciously?) utilized.

<p><p>As I mentioned, I was not careful in formulating my question to Dan. So I 
<br>
was actually a bit surprised with the direction it took in the replies above 
<br>
- I was given responses quite relevant to my intial inquiry, despite that it 
<br>
had never been specifically stated.
<br>
So I guess that would make me the shy lurker. I'm new to the list (and 
<br>
admittedly a bit intimidated), taking a break from school, making big life 
<br>
changes, &amp; considering a drastic change in my major. Any suggestions 
<br>
regarding readings, list etiquette, etc. would be greatly appreciated.
<br>
Thanks!
