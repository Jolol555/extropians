<em>&gt; &gt; In Florida, carrying large sums of cash, say over $10,000, is legally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defined as &quot;suspicious&quot;.  The police can and do seize such large amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cash under the assumption that it is drug money.  The cash can be retrieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only if the person can prove where it came from and that it was obtained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legally.  Any unexplained cash that is not later retrieved is simply kept by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, yes, of course. Not that I like it, but this is an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational argument to make, because if you kept that amount of cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of a bank account, then you must be trying to hide it from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government for some reason. At the very least you are trying to evade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax laws, at worst you are engaging in illicit trade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also rational to assume that if you got that amount of cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimately, you should be able to demonstrate with receipt records who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you got it from and for what... at which point you'll be asked to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes on it...  of course, the fact that many businesses deal in far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater sums every day has no bearing... a legitimate business is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed to keep the sort of records that would show how the money was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earned ;)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, Mike,but your narrow world-view here is a bit detached from
<br>
reality.  I, and many other professional and semi-pro poker players
<br>
I know, routinely carry large amounts of cash into and out of casinos,
<br>
and we don't get receipts for every transaction.  Many cash merchants
<br>
carry large amounts as well (though they tend to have better records).
<br>
<p>And besides, isn't hiding income from the government a marvellous
<br>
life-affirming expression of libertarian values?
