<p>
estropico &gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Because of the undeniable libertarian streak in extropian thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine by me, btw). All extropians are transhumanists, but not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists are extropians. The difference is that extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to call spontaneuos-order transhumanists, while many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily so (see J.Hughes).
</em><br>
<p>OK, I wanted you to more explicitly define extropians as transhumanists.  I
<br>
thought you were excluding transhumanism in the formula for extropians.
<br>
<p>I love extropian ideas, and think they fit in fine with the Extropian
<br>
Principles.  However, I think it is confusing to *define* extropians in
<br>
terms of libertarian politics.  If a transhumanist asks about Extropians, it
<br>
would make more sense to direct them to the Extropian Principles instead of
<br>
the Libertarian Party.  Trying to define Extropy = Transhumanism +
<br>
Libertarianism is too simplistic to accurately define us.  Defining
<br>
libertarianism as a requirement or core definition of Extropy excludes many
<br>
extropians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was not trying to write the movement's history. Just reasoning that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism is what humanists came up with when they adopt the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is right to use technology to improve on Homo Sapiens (the CMT), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy is what libertarians come up with in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>As long as you don't claim that this is the history of Extropy Institute, or
<br>
an official definition of what the extropian philosophy is, that is fine.
<br>
However, if you tell people that this is what Extropy Institute actually
<br>
did, or this is how extropians are actually defined, you will just confuse
<br>
people including the people you are attempting to define.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about the history of extropy, if you had to pick a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind the birth of the extropian philosophy, who would you pick?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max More's early libertarian writings are still available on the web.
</em><br>
<p>Max More's early cryonics writings, uploading writings, self-modification
<br>
writings, space-travel writings, and other transhumanist writings are also
<br>
on the web as well.  Why do you not define him primarily as a transhumanist?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, the recognition that the CMT is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily bound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any particular idelogy could help avoiding the continuos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bickering among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tranhsumanists of different political convictions so typical of the list.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I don't think we can pin a single political viewpoint as a
<br>
defining factor.  We are all extropian transhumanists here (mostly), but we
<br>
have too many political viewpoints to try to define only one as being the
<br>
only extropian option.  There are liberal, conservative, anarchist,
<br>
libertarian, apolitical, and other kinds of extropians and transhumanists.
