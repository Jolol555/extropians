<p>thanks! i'll look into that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm curious: you appear to be a young female (or so I surmise from your

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>sure. i'm always amused by the ambiguousness of the name cheshire. like i said in my 
<br>
intro, i'm genderqueer, and what i consider my gender changes quite often. i'm biologically 
<br>
male (not much harm in saying that, since any passing i do goes away as soon as i open 
<br>
my mouth), and i always read cheshire as male, too. (not unlike my gender, it isn't the 
<br>
name i was given when i was born.) but it was my name for so long, that when i first 
<br>
decided that i was not-a-boy, i kept using it, and people often read me as being female, 
<br>
so i kept using it when i decided i was a girl, and then since it worked fine for either, 
<br>
when i decided i wasn't a boy or a girl, i kept using it.
<br>
let's see....... i first found out about transhumanism in general a year and a half ago, or so. 
<br>
it's funny, because up to this point i had been quite the misanthrope, and i fully supported 
<br>
the church of euthanasia. so something must have really clicked for me to completely turn 
<br>
around like that. i honestly can't think of any one single thing that attracted me... i'm sure 
<br>
the amount of sci-fi i read (quite a lot) when i was little has a lot to do with it (my dad 
<br>
raised me on x-men and larry niven).
<br>
anyway, i just like the idea of living forever/quite a long time. there's a lot that i'd like to 
<br>
do, and i doubt i can do it all in a measly 80 more years or so.
<br>
i can say with certainty that a lot of interest in biotech comes from my asthma and gender 
<br>
dysphoria. while i wouldn't get srs now, even if i could have fully functional reproductive 
<br>
organs, there was a time when i would've killed to be able to. now my goal is to be able to 
<br>
reconfigure my body at will :) and i'd just like my asthma gone, period.
