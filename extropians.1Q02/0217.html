<em>&gt; Not *as* poor and ignorant, *more so*, far more, for then they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look successful in comparison.  They wont stop hating us for dropping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food on them either.  That may stem the tide of mass starvation, but we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be sure the militant muslims will be all the more eager to slash our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throats at the very first opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're right...
<br>
So, as I've said before, we won't move into a better future until we debunk
<br>
religiosity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another take on this:  the African continent is watching all this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play out.  They must be asking themselves: do we want to be like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faithful wretches starving and cowering in caves?  Or do we want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be like the great satan up there in jets blasting away in complete safety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at their leisure?  We'll take... satan for 500 please Alex.
</em><br>
<p>First they probably need to find a cure for AIDS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The African masses will surely be drawn westward, which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enrage the militant muslims ever more.  If there is a way to resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this without appalling bloodshed, I sure havent thought of it.  spike
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about the African masses, but I agree that we need resolution
<br>
rather than conciliation.
<br>
Hmmm... people die of AIDS without bloodshed don't they?
<br>
Please disregard that last remark.

<p>From: &quot;Geraint Rees&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:g.rees@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20Aid%20for%20Afghanistan">g.rees@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is a funny use of the word 'expose'. US involvement in Afghanistan in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 80s had three important effects (1) It provided military training to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals including bin Laden, who later engaged in unanticipated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist actions against the US
</em><br>
<p>The US has provided military training to many individuals, but only bin Laden
<br>
and his minions used this training in unanticipated terrorist actions... Hence
<br>
the actions did help to expose the terrorists, who might not have been so
<br>
brazen without the US training.
<br>
It's rather like giving small caliber side-arms to youngsters to see if they
<br>
can be trusted with more lethal ordnance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) It provided a very large quantity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms, initially to further the anti-Soviet fight, but later used locally by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Taliban (and others) against the US
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the US has provided arms to many individuals, but only bin Laden and his
<br>
minions used this in unanticipated terrorist actions... Hence the actions did
<br>
help to expose the terrorists, who might not have been so audacious without
<br>
the US
<br>
training.
<br>
It's rather like giving small caliber side-arms to youngsters to see if they
<br>
can be trusted with more lethal ordnance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (3) It deliberately fostered a local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture of militant Islam, initially directed against the Soviet occupation.
</em><br>
<p>If the local culture is susceptible to &quot;militant Islam&quot; and so crazed as to
<br>
allow itself to be &quot;fostered,&quot; then &quot;fostering&quot; it helps to expose that
<br>
craziness.
<br>
What a brilliant method of flushing out crazies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To this extent, US foreign policy contributed to the current situation;
</em><br>
<p>The current situation (elimination of the Taliban and Al Quaida) is probably
<br>
much improved over what it might have become if the terrorists had not been
<br>
exposed (and eliminated).
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; in what sense
<br>
<em>&gt; did US involvement in the 1980s lead to the terrorists being exposed?
</em><br>
<p>The US provided the means to test the trustworthiness of groups whose
<br>
trustworthiness was unknown before they exposed themselves as anti-American
<br>
terrorists. Good thing they were exposed before they got their hands on some
<br>
ICBMs or something even more powerful.
<br>
Now, if the rest of the world remains ignorant about the malignancy of true
<br>
believer terrorists who want to bring about Armageddon, then it may actually
<br>
happen.
<br>
So, the 9-11 attack should serve as a wake-up call for civilization: Either
<br>
debunk this malicious religiosity, or welcome to the End Times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My point was that the original risk assessment in the 1980s was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faulty, in the sense that it fostered the conditions that led to the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>It's probably not wise to try to second guess the US military or US foreign
<br>
policy.
<br>
(Did Clinton *have* a foreign policy in the 80s?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that this doesn't in any way imply US responsibility for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism, but does suggest that we should pay attention to the root causes.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, always pay attention to the insane jealousy and envy of religious
<br>
fanatics and terrorist losers.
<br>
Better yet, pay attention to getting rid of them once and for all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point was that the *original* action by the US in the 80s appeared to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive short term gain (fight the Soviet Union). But with hindsight it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned out to have extremely negative long term implications (fostering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; militant Islam).
</em><br>
<p>&quot;militant Islam&quot; was fostered long before there ever was a United States of
<br>
America.
<br>
(Or perhaps you've never heard of &quot;Holy Wars&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus actions can have unanticipated consequences;
</em><br>
<p>Right -- the actions of the terrorists have resulted in the unanticipated
<br>
elimination of the Taliban and Al Quaida... and we may have prevented the
<br>
religious fanatics fulfilling their idiotic biblical prophesies of
<br>
Armageddon. Pretty nice, eh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy should therefore seek to learn from such experiences. That's all I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting!
</em><br>
<p>Well, thanks for the suggestion... and all I'm saying is that the situation
<br>
has probably turned out better as a result of what the US has done.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I'm using 'military' vs 'politics' as a shorthand here for
<br>
<em>&gt; 'killing people with marines' versus 'helping set up democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions' or similar.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that democracy appeals much to terrorist groups. This is a job for the
<br>
Marines, not for the politicians. As the Marines are fond of saying, &quot;It's up
<br>
to Allah to forgive Osama bin Laden. It's up to us to make sure they meet.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (BTW, whatever happened to the 'no ad hominem attacks' policy that I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told about when I recently joined the list?!).
</em><br>
<p>I've not made an ad hominem attack here, and I find offensive your
<br>
implication that I have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a misrepresentation of my position. I'm making a very simple point;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the foreign policy of the US in Afghanistan in the 1980s had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unanticipated consequences.
</em><br>
<p>Unanticipated by whom? You can't know whether the consequences of US actions
<br>
in Afghanistan in the 1980s have been anticipated or not. That's conjecture on
<br>
your part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This does not imply any form of US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility for thhose consequences. Nor does it imply I don't support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current US actions (I do). However, I do believe that all of us benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from considering the unanticipated consequences of our actions, in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider modifying our behaviour in future to prevent such undesirable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consquences occurring. That's all.
</em><br>
<p>To the extent that's good advice, it ought to be shared with religionists who
<br>
unwittingly contribute to horrible consequences by failing to anticipate the
<br>
consequences of their belief systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Today the world is a safer place due to US action against terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We'll see. I certainly hope so, but I am not optimistic.
</em><br>
<p>If you're not optimistic, you may be on the wrong list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that anything else could have been done right now, given the circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>But you implied that we weren't &quot;given&quot; the circumstances. You've said that
<br>
the circumstances resulted as a consequence of what the US had done back in
<br>
the 80s.
<br>
AFAIC, the US is doing exactly the right thing, and needs to do more of it.
<br>
As Mike Lorrey has said, we're bombing Stone Age Afghanistan into the 20th
<br>
century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If the kind of passive denial that you advocate were to prevail, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorists would go on terrorizing the whole world, and by now they might
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have carried out their vow to destroy Israel. But then, perhaps that's
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you secretly want to happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll ignore this ad hominem attack if that's all right by you.
</em><br>
<p>What you have ignored is the fact that I wrote **perhaps** and it was neither
<br>
intended as an ad hominem, nor do I believe it to be so.

<br>
<em>&gt; I was arguing that it is important to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find out whether it is more efficient to continue the course or to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's behavior, before one takes irrevocable actions.
</em><br>
<p>That definitely fits the Subject line: &quot;Aid for Afghanistan&quot;
<br>
They sure needed to consider whether is more efficient to continue their
<br>
course or to change their behavior... but, they've already taken irrevocable
<br>
actions.

<br>
<em>&gt; While I'd not dispute that some US policies contributed to motivations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did not make anyone do what they did, so your claim that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'causative agents' is false, as usual. Do you believe that those people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are mere automatons, unable to exercise independent thought or action?
</em><br>
<p>Excellent question, Mike. But of course you're only feeding the trolls.
