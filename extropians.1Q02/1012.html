</em><br>
<em>&gt; time with animals has likely seen homosexuality there.  So rural

<p><p>You have to distinguish between Western rural, Southern rural, and
<br>
Midwestern rural as they each have distinctive cultures that handle these
<br>
things differently.
<br>
<p>I have another theory based on what I've observed, at least as it applies to
<br>
Western rural culture.  The problem ultimately is that there are no gay
<br>
cowboys for any practical purpose.  Gay culture (as a generalization) tends
<br>
to strongly reflect the values and ideals of the notoriously left-wing urban
<br>
culture that they are stereotyped as being part of (think San Francisco).
<br>
The sum total exposure to the homosexual community that the rural community
<br>
receives is from TV shows (which just perpetuate the stereotype), and their
<br>
very limited personal interactions, which also tend to at least partially
<br>
confirm the stereotype.  In my experience there has never been an
<br>
intrinsically anti-homosexual tendency to Western rural culture, unlike
<br>
Southern rural culture which does seem to have this tendency.
<br>
<p>The problem is that rural Western culture has been placed in a very
<br>
adversarial position against what is perceived as a rabid left-wing urban
<br>
culture hell-bent on destroying them.  Whether it is true or not, it is hard
<br>
to live out there and not see it that way because Western rural communities
<br>
are politically impotent due to their sparse populations and have received
<br>
the short end of the stick on most matters that concern them at the Federal
<br>
level.  The problem with homosexuality isn't that they view homosexuals as
<br>
intrinsically bad or anything like that, but that homosexuals appear to be
<br>
the quintessential members of the very culture that is attacking them.  In a
<br>
nutshell, Western rural culture views homosexuals as political enemies in a
<br>
fight that rural Westerners are taking very seriously.  It isn't anything
<br>
personal.
<br>
<p>Only tangentially related, while I have serious misgivings about Midwestern
<br>
and Southern rural culture for one reason or another, I find that rural
<br>
Western culture has a great many fine qualities that make it one of the best
<br>
regional subcultures the U.S. has.  It is a shame that it is being actively
<br>
attacked by another subculture that has far less redeeming value and
<br>
considerably more political clout.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
