<p><p>I know some people in their 90s that are still having a great

time with original equipment!  Fortunately, some of them are 
<br>
related to me so maybe I inherited more than a likely long life. :)
<br>
<p>The way I figure it, we better get SI together before we invent 
<br>
really good full-body immersive VR.  If we invent the latter 
<br>
first, it is doubtful that many of our nerds will manage to keep 
<br>
their minds on the problem of creating the former.  I personally 
<br>
know a dozen of the brightest people I've ever met who have 
<br>
spent most of the last year when they weren't at their paying 
<br>
gig or asleep playing EverQuest.  And it's not even reasonably 
<br>
VR!  The bright side though, is that most of these people would 
<br>
never notice or much care if they were uploaded tomorrow. 
<br>
Adjustment would not be a problem.  It is adjusting to not being 
<br>
in a sim world that troubles them.
