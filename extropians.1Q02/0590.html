</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As likely as them being bankrolled by the UN. Did you ever think of
<br>
that? Maybe (putting my Dossy Fanclub Paranoid Propeller Cap on) the UN
<br>
staged this whole series of events to help motivate the world to
<br>
stripping the US and other nations of sovereignty and power, putting
<br>
more authority, and trust in greater power for the UN over member
<br>
nations. This is about as likely (maybe even more likely, and it fits
<br>
the facts better) as your scenario.
<br>
<p>For example:
<br>
The UN and many left wing controlled european nations have been peeved
<br>
at the US recently pulling out of treaties and international conferences
<br>
which would have economically strangulated the US, and stripped its
<br>
citizens of their sovereign rights (like the 2nd amendment, among
<br>
others).
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>The UN has consistently supported Palestinian independence and
<br>
sovereignty, and consistently voted for measures seeking to sanction and
<br>
punish Israel and its citizens for defending their own right to exist.
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>The office of the UN General Secretary has been under the control of the
<br>
muslim nations of Africa for the past decade.
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>Major muslim media has been obsessed not with the criminal actions of
<br>
its own people, but in denying their culpability with claims of
<br>
Israeli/American conspiracies, no matter how much the actual
<br>
perpetrators admit their culpability on video.
<br>
<p>It is rather obvious, using the same sort of logic that Dossy uses, that
<br>
the attack of 9-11 was orchestrated by a ruling faction of muslim
<br>
nations in the UN in an attempt to deflect the rise of renewed American
<br>
self assertion on the world stage.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is absolutely no factual evidence supporting such a
<br>
linkage, not to the level required in a courtroom, but there is far more
<br>
evidence supporting this scenario than that claimed by Dossy.
