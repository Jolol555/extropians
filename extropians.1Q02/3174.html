I really like the idea of creating AND marketing an Extropian Fragrance.  But how much money and effort would this take?  I hope this is not just all idle talk on our part. 
<br>
<p>While we have discussed the fragrance itself, what about the advertising campaign??  This is the key to a successful fragrance!  
<br>
<p>Max and Natasha in an ad reminiscent of the ones with Liz Taylor?  Or for inspiration we could consider the classic ad from Karate cologne which had a man being chased by hordes of beautiful women after splashing on some of their fragrance!  He uses his martial arts skills to gently deflect all the women grasping at him!!  I really loved those ads as a fourteen year-old boy.  ; )
<br>
<p>I think an ad campaign which shows smart, educated, savvy, and sexy people living their lives by the extropian principles(though this might not be stated, only implied), and thereby attracting high quality members of the opposite sex, would be the best way to market the fragrance.  
<br>
<p>We could also show the people in the ads attaining job success, volunteering in their community, and bonding with family and friends.  We would sell the message &quot;if you use the Extropy fragrance, you are a caring and capable person who is going places.&quot;      
<br>
<p>I'm sure many of you out there can come up with great tv commercial ideas to best promote the Extropy fragrance.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
