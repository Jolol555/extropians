Just curious what other extropians think of this - Mike
<br>
<p><a href="http://lifeboat.com/">http://lifeboat.com/</a>
<br>
<p>Welcome to The Lifeboat Foundation! Our goal is to save the human race from
<br>
extinction. Why do we think the human race will become
<br>
extinct later this century? Because advanced technologies available by about
<br>
2020 will enable one evil or simply clumsy person to
<br>
destroy all life on earth. 
<br>
<p>_Why do we think the human race will become extinct later this century? _
<br>
<p>Because advanced technologies available by around 2020 will enable one evil
<br>
or simply clumsy person to destroy all life on earth. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One such advancement is nanotechnology. A nanotechnology based weapon known
<br>
as gray goo could easily exterminate every living thing, including viruses,
<br>
in about two days.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Engineered viruses and other biological weapons could also lead to our
<br>
extinction. Then there's antimatter bombs, uncontrollable AI, and finally
<br>
high energy particle accelerator mishaps which could destroy our local
<br>
space-time continuum. As you can see, there are various means by which all
<br>
life could be extinguished in the near future. And we've probably left out a
<br>
few. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We predict a 25% possibility of destruction due to a lab accident and a 25%
<br>
possibility of destruction due to anti-terrorism systems malfunctioning such
<br>
as a software glitch in the active nanotechnological shield proposed by Eric
<br>
Drexler in his book Engines of Creation. And last, but not least, there is a
<br>
50% possibility of annihilation by terrorism. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And we're not the only ones making that prediction. Arthur C. Clarke, the
<br>
visionary author who, in 1945, predicted a world linked by geostationary
<br>
satellites, was recently quoted as saying, &quot;This terrorism is a frightful
<br>
danger and it is hard to see how we can get complete protection from it&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The sad fact is that it will take very little resources to launch a
<br>
nanotechnology attack, basically resources equivalent to the cost of the
<br>
2001 anthrax attack in the U.S. And the FBI believes that particular attack
<br>
was the work of a lone crazy. With this in mind, it's not hard to imagine
<br>
the disastrous result of nanotechnological weapons falling into the wrong
<br>
hands.
