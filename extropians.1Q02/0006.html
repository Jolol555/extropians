<p>Well you do need some discussion about what is considered part
<br>
of the &quot;commons&quot; and what is &quot;owned&quot;.  I suspect it will change
<br>
quite a bit as the ease with which material goods can be created
<br>
and by whom changes.  I also suspect that worrying about how
<br>
many monetary tokens one has will be a lot less prevalent.  I am
<br>
very interested in creating greater value.  I am singularly
<br>
uninterested in mere accumulation of lots of tokens.  Arguably,
<br>
having a large and well-stocked commons can lead to more
<br>
innovation and growth of real value than having almost
<br>
everything owned.

<p><p><em>&gt; resources remains the same--the amount of solar energy the planet
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not so.  The effective amount of wealth does not remain the
<br>
same. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that will grow exponentially.  When we move out into the galaxy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the pool expands even more, but it's still a fixed pool,
</em><br>
<p>That it is not literally infinite is rather beside the point. 
<br>
It is certainly not be any stretch &quot;scarcity&quot; of the kind our
<br>
economic system was designed to cope with unless we create
<br>
artificial scarcity by insisting the commons stays artificially
<br>
small and everything imaginable has a price tag slapped on it. 
<br>
I have actually heard some go so far as to claim that every atom
<br>
of matter and erg of energy must be owned by someone.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; and humans will disagree about how to use those resources--indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be even more disagreement than there is now, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be more people with different desires, and more /kinds/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people (AI, etc.) with desires we can't even imagine now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think that the lid will be off for long enough that we won't
<br>
be doing too much fighting for a while after MNT is fully
<br>
deployed.  It would be a refreshing change.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Just because it's harder for humans to visualize the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between 1 and 2 billion than to visualize the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 and 2 hundred doesn't mean the difference doesn't exist.  As I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said before, when everyone on the planet is a billionaire, the guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 10 billion still gets the girl, the bigger spaceship, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asteroid in the better neighborhood, and the nicer toys.  &quot;Scarcity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a relative thing.
</em><br>
<p>I would hope that we grow out of this kind of adolescent rivalry
<br>
fairly soon.  But I won't hold my breath.
