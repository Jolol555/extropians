<em>&gt; Finally one needs to balance the benefit any diagnostic information
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance that against diagnostic information that might result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with regard to pre-existing conditions.
</em><br>
<p>But this was my point in my post.  That's why I asked and ask again:
<br>
&quot;Is the benefit worth the risk?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our ability to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the ill-effects of current tests will be significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased in the future.  So tests which significantly serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to promote one surviving to that future time (without having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be suspended) are perhaps justifiable even if they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be considered undesirable in a perfect world.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure.  Just offering as a position is not the same as actually
<br>
quantifying the risks and benefits involved.  Until more work is done in
<br>
this area, I don't plan on taking a whole body scan and I recommend
<br>
others likewise stay away from it -- unless there is some underlying
<br>
condition.
<br>
<p>Also, given the variation in levels of training, technique, and
<br>
equipment, it's also best to stay away from such risky diagnostic
<br>
techniques.  Until there's more uniformity and quality measures in this
<br>
area, it's best to shy away from it.  Let the other sheep get sheered or
<br>
skinned alive.:)
<br>
<p>I also bet a lot of the people getting full body scans don't do much
<br>
more practical things, such as get yearly blood tests or physicals.  If
<br>
there's one medical procedure I do recommend to everyone on this list,
<br>
it's to get comprehensive blood tests at least once every two years, if
<br>
not more.  Check into your health coverage to see if this is covered.
<br>
<p>As for the earlier comment:
<br>
<em>&gt; One might &quot;mitigate&quot; these effects (perhaps by consuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high levels of Vitamin E for a couple of weeks before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examination).
</em><br>
<p>I think something more than increasing vitamin E levels is in order.
<br>
Also, I'm not sure if antioxidants in themselves will be enough.  More
<br>
work needs to be done.
<br>
<p>Relurking!
