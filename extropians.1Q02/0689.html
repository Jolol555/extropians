<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;More or less my own feelings on timing; be great if it happens, but it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something you can gamble on. But asking people to believe it might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen in time is asking people to work and think about death. Very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpopular, those topics.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I think that quite a few of us would work just as hard toward 
<br>
Extropian goals even if we knew that we would not make it to 
<br>
Singularity or indefinite lifespan ourselves - even if we knew 
<br>
that cryonics would not work for us.  Personally I would still 
<br>
want it for what is left of humanity and for my own children 
<br>
even if I could not make it myself.
<br>
<p>Sometimes I get a bit worried about this movement because it is 
<br>
possible that we have an achilles heel in being so deeply 
<br>
concerned for personal survival, perversely enough.  People who 
<br>
are extremely bent on survival at almost any cost can be more 
<br>
easily threatened and coerced.  They will not necessarily &quot;go 
<br>
the distance&quot; in old monkey talk.  Now an extremely rational 
<br>
extropian will do everything possible to exercise all options 
<br>
and support all causes ve believes in without risking death to a 
<br>
significant degree.  But I still worry that the deathists have a 
<br>
bit of an edge in brinkmanship.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;The Singularity tomorrow thing is so much like a religion in far too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways. Quite likely suicide too, if enough people adhere to it. In a way it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be real annoying to have them tell you &quot;I told you so&quot; after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (insert number here) years of hard work by the rest of us have brought the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity about while the lazy ones lazed around just *believing*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, I think most religions are too much like Singularity!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps because they believe that its just around the corner, contributes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such fervor or enthusiasm? My dyspepsia is technological forecasts concerning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast changes in the human condition, have tended to err on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyper-optimistic. We, as a species and individuals, do need an 'insurance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy,' even if we are denying that we do.
</em><br>
<p><p>Vast changes in humans that remain humans is very doubtful.  But 
<br>
humans that transcend humanness?  We shall see.  I don't think 
<br>
it will come easy and I certainly don't believe it is 
<br>
&quot;inevitable&quot;.  Much too much can throw a spanner in the works. 
<br>
And I don't think most of us have really considered how deeply 
<br>
we will have to change psychologically to cope with going beyond 
<br>
the human.
