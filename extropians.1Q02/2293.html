<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;No envy here.  I just don't understand how some human beings (one not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially different from another) are worth billions and some are barely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valued at all (no matter how hard they work - and by &quot;work&quot; I mean doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that takes away from one's leisure and personal time).  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok. I am not saying this is fair, or how the world should be, However, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be a part of randomness that serves,among other things evolution.
</em><br>
<p>We are no longer slaves to evolution.  We have the power to ameliorate some
<br>
changes now, and need not simply sit around letting them eat cake (to
<br>
forestall allocating some truly important things, like ... national health
<br>
insurance).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I believe that when intelligent life has a better fix on manipulating
</em><br>
matter
<br>
<em>&gt; and energy, and or we become part of a rather nice Singularity, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throw away your cares and concerns about inequality and unfairness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deprivation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if  it happens and when it happens ... but what about in the meantime?
<br>
We have the resources to effect good changes now (and just in case things
<br>
don't turn out as fast and as optimally as we would wish).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Or as my paternal grandfather was quoted; &quot;come the revolution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll all eat strawberries and cream
</em><br>
<p>Hee hee.  Funny, my paternal grandfather cursed the revolution, but that was
<br>
a totally different revolution (Russian, 1917) ... when his strawberries and
<br>
cream were temporarily suspended.  (But seriously, I know which revolution
<br>
you're talking about.)
<br>
<p>O.
