INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS:Confronting the Post-Post-Cold War World
<br>
<p>Thomas H. Henriksen
<br>
<p>The geopolitical vacuum of the immediate post-Cold War years is quickly being filled, with the United States now facing
<br>
a neoimperializing Russia, an ascendant China, an emerging India, a restive European Union, and a rising-and often
<br>
militant-Islam.
<br>
Thomas H. Henriksen is an associate director and senior fellow at the Hoover
<br>
Institution. <a href="http://www-hoover.stanford.edu/publications/digest/012/henriksen.html">http://www-hoover.stanford.edu/publications/digest/012/henriksen.html</a>
<br>
<p>Poised on the cusp of a new millennium, American power and influence in world affairs have never been so resplendent.
<br>
Since the demise of the Soviet Union a decade ago, the United States stands unchallenged by a single state or any
<br>
foreseeable league of states. Its powerhouse economy, unrivaled military forces, technological prowess, and even the
<br>
sway of its popular cultural all bear testament to America's ascendancy. Great prosperity at home and peace abroad
<br>
enshrine the current period as a golden age in the nation's history.
<br>
<p>This preponderance of power has, in fact, perplexed politicians, pundits, and academicians as to what international
<br>
course the United States should set. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the United States confronts a radically
<br>
altered international landscape with neither a clear goal nor a compass for foreign affairs. Lacking a superpower rival
<br>
for the last decade, the United States has had trouble defining its international role.
<br>
The United States ought to help alleviate natural and man-made calamities in far-off lands. International passivity is
<br>
no virtue in a world where weapons proliferation, international terrorism, and geostrategic realignments are afoot.
<br>
<p>This essay lays out a case for measured global activism. There is no other realistic option than an internationalist
<br>
role for the United States. Such advocacy is cognizant of America's historical role and its future interests. Withdrawal
<br>
or even &quot;realist&quot; prescriptions designed to reject moral guidelines in favor of a self-interest-only foreign policy will
<br>
not guarantee American interests. During the 1920s and 1930s, the United States slid into isolationism to avoid world
<br>
problems only to pay a heavy price when it belatedly had to confront militarized and expansionist states in World War
<br>
II. America has a vested interest in peaceful change and broadly shared prosperity overseas. A major European or Asian
<br>
war at the least would affect America's well-being and at worst would draw the United States into the conflict.
<br>
<p>The United States ought to help alleviate natural and man-made calamities in far-off lands. International passivity is
<br>
no virtue in a world where weapons proliferation, international terrorism, and geostrategic realignments are afoot. But
<br>
our foreign policy must not become a prisoner to the Haitis and Somalias of the world. Action ought to be undertaken
<br>
only when costs can be kept in check. And, just as in wars, coalition intervention should be embraced, as much to share
<br>
burdens as to deflect charges of American hegemony.
<br>
<p>For more than a hundred years, influential Americans have believed that the road to world peace could be paved with
<br>
economic development, commercial integration, and international treaties. Before and after World War I, American
<br>
policymakers and many public intellectuals gave voice to this vision. In the 1920s, this idealism led to the League of
<br>
Nations, an arms control agreement to limit the size and number of warships, and even a treaty-the Kellogg-Briand Pact
<br>
of 1928-to outlaw war itself. Neither these legalistic formulas nor the moralistic sentiments inspired by them sufficed
<br>
to spare the world from a second global conflict. They did contribute to a false sense of security, however. As a
<br>
consequence, Americans awoke to an ominous world in the late thirties.During the last decade, we have seen spectacular
<br>
displays of American techno-warfare-without decisive political victories.
<br>
<p>In today's post-Cold War era, America is again pushing free trade and economic integration as a means to worldwide
<br>
harmony. Globalization is this age's shibboleth. Although prosperity and interdependence are important dimensions of
<br>
international cooperation, they alone cannot ensure peaceful relations among states. Trade does not occur in a vacuum.
<br>
<p>An internationalist posture is all the more imperative as the United States grapples with the evolving multipolar world.
<br>
The geopolitical vacuum of the immediate post-Cold War years is now giving way to a resurgence of great-power politics
<br>
amid extreme nationalistic and religious fervor. Evidence of this reconfiguration is seen in the policies of a
<br>
neoimperializing Russia, an ascending China, an emerging India, a widening restiveness within the European Union, and a
<br>
rising militant form of Islam. Each of these political entities is reaching out to states in their respective geographic
<br>
spheres and beyond. During the 1990s, the United States had the luxury of choosing between international engagement or
<br>
disengagement without worrying about the consequences among the world's major players. The chessboard now has more
<br>
determined pieces in the game. The new circumstances also permit secondary powers-Japan, Germany, and Iran-more latitude
<br>
than they had during the Cold War. Pawns as well as queens can now influence the game.
<br>
<p>Missed Opportunities
<br>
<p>No period in its history has offered the United States more opportunities for shaping international politics for
<br>
American ends than the years immediately following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Even after World War II, the United
<br>
States enjoyed much less freedom, for its postwar plans soon bumped up against the Soviet Union's Central European
<br>
dominance and, later, its global ambitions. But over the past decade Washington has considered economic globalization
<br>
and political self-determination as ends themselves rather than as a means to larger ends.
<br>
<p>On the face of it, the United States has been hyperagressively exercising power abroad since the Soviet Union's
<br>
breakdown. Washington kicked off the decade of the 1990s with the deployment of more than a half million ground troops
<br>
in the Persian Gulf and ended it by unleashing significant air power to the Kosovo campaign. It fired missiles at Sudan
<br>
and Afghanistan in retaliation for terrorist attacks. It ousted the Haitian military junta and steamed warships into
<br>
Taiwanese waters to put the Chinese on notice for launching rockets during the island's first direct presidential
<br>
election.
<br>
<p>But none of these operations succeeded in disarming a superweapons threat. Iraq and North Korea persist in their
<br>
dangerous course of furtively developing weapons of mass destruction. Nor have any peacekeeping missions secured a
<br>
durable political order without an ongoing U.S. military presence. When the United States has made use of its awesome
<br>
military prowess, it has been applied so tentatively that it has hobbled its impact-just look at predemocratic Serbia,
<br>
post-Gulf War Iraq, or the nest of terrorist networks in the Middle East. As a result, there have been spectacular
<br>
displays of techno-warfare without decisive political victories.
<br>
<p>A vacillating diplomacy is unlikely to impress determined rulers in China or Russia, just as it failed to impress in
<br>
Milosevic's Serbia, Iraq, or various terrorist cells. This brand of internationalism should be discredited as
<br>
ineffective and cosmetic posturing. America serves as the key guarantor of an open global framework. Washington must
<br>
work within the international system to ensure a fellowship of free nations and to prevent a major conflict. But in the
<br>
final analysis, the United States must look to its own devices, not trust in foreign princes or fanciful diplomacy. Its
<br>
leadership, nevertheless, can be translated through collective bodies and coalition approaches, as has been the case
<br>
with NATO.
<br>
<p>The Road Ahead
<br>
<p>The post-Cold War era-characterized by the lessening of major power politics-is ending. We have begun to move to
<br>
another, as yet unnamed, period. The early post-Soviet years witnessed a strategic imbalance resulting from the sudden
<br>
implosion of Moscow's vast empire. This disequilibrium no longer pertains.
<br>
There is no other realistic option than an internationalist role for the United States. Withdrawal or even &quot;realist&quot;
<br>
prescriptions designed to reject moral guidelines in favor of a self-interest-only foreign policy will not guarantee
<br>
American interests.
<br>
<p>Neither Russia nor China views itself as solely a regional power. Both seek to compete globally with the United States.
<br>
Both export arms and advanced technology to worrisome states like Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Pakistan. They sidled up
<br>
to each other so as to give reality to a reemerging Sino-Russian entente that suggests a great-power triangle. India
<br>
asserts itself diplomatically and militarily in adjoining areas. The EU hungers for a greater international role on the
<br>
international stage. The post-Cold War strategic vacuum is filling with political crosscurrents and new ambitions.
<br>
<p>India is also fast assuming a larger geopolitical role. The economic, demographic, and democratic significance of India
<br>
has only begun to be noted in Washington. India's location in South Asia, proximity to China, growing economy, and
<br>
respected military capacity make it an appealing U.S. partner. In the next decade, the United States must establish a
<br>
closer relationship with New Delhi. India's troubled relations with China should also give it standing with a United
<br>
States concerned about China's ambitions.
<br>
<p>Weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles during the East-West standoff were confined largely to a small number
<br>
of major powers, which looked to international agreements to maintain a nuclear balance. Today, the proliferation of
<br>
rockets and nuclear components to unfriendly regimes poses a grave threat to the United States and many other countries
<br>
and demands a reconsideration of policy options. Atomic weapons capacity is becoming a global reality. India and
<br>
Pakistan, neither of which are rogue states, joined the membership of declared nuclear states by testing devices in
<br>
1998. The United States must recalibrate its policies to take account of these changing realities. Arms control
<br>
treaties, created for the symmetrical Cold War power relationship, are no longer as effective against big-power-supplied
<br>
rogues, who ignore legal niceties. This emerging threat makes some sort of missile shield a categorical imperative.
<br>
<p>When dealing with Russia and China, Washington must redouble its diplomatic exertions to halt their patronage of rogue
<br>
dictators. It is not enough just to engage Moscow and Beijing commercially with the aim of guiding them toward free
<br>
markets, democracy, and peaceful relations among big powers. Stopping the export of missile and nuclear technology must
<br>
be part of the negotiation process. Washington must also pursue forceful diplomacy that divides patrons from rogue
<br>
regimes, thus neutralizing such regimes.
<br>
<p>Because circumstances differ with each rogue, the steps to be taken against them can vary from muscular covert actions
<br>
that topple dictators to economic and diplomatic engagement. One minimalist but long-term approach entails diplomatic
<br>
and material aid to shadow governments either inside or outside the rogue regimes. But whatever the course of action, it
<br>
must be sustained beyond the poll-driven photo-op approach so characteristic of the Clinton presidency.
<br>
<p>With respect to failed states that implode, causing misery and death for their inhabitants, the past is prologue. There
<br>
will probably be more of these, particularly in Africa. Colombia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and post-Castro Cuba could also
<br>
join the ranks of catastrophic human tragedies. While the United States cannot make lambs lie down with lions, it has to
<br>
intervene in some civil disorders, such as the Balkans, because they adjoin regions central to American interests. If
<br>
the United States always stood aside, its cherished values would be discredited; damage to American prestige and
<br>
credibility will undercut U.S. interests. Extravagant crusades for democracy or human rights cannot be sustained but
<br>
neither can a policy of blanket nonintervention. It behooves America, however, not to become bogged down in the
<br>
aftermath of direct military interventions. Mundane police duties are best left to others.
<br>
The United States must distinguish between the muscular internationalism of Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan, on the one
<br>
side, and the utopian multilateralism of Woodrow Wilson and Bill Clinton, on the other. Practical internationalism is
<br>
critical to preventing war, expanding trade, and promoting democracy and respect for human rights. This leadership can
<br>
be translated through collective security arrangements and regional frameworks, but it cannot be solely reliant on them
<br>
in all circumstances.
<br>
The promotion of democracy and human rights serves American interests in ways that realpolitik can never accomplish
<br>
alone.
<br>
<p>Sticking up for our values does not harm the pursuit of our vital interests, for our values are not distinct from our
<br>
interests. The realistic promotion of democracy and human rights serves American interests in ways that realpolitik can
<br>
never accomplish alone. Obviously, the United States cannot ignore the balance of power or the emergence of a power
<br>
capable of dominating the Eurasian continent. This overriding objective demanded large-scale U.S. politico-military
<br>
intervention in European affairs three times in the past century. Worst-case scenarios mounted by China or Russia would
<br>
foreclose American humanitarian endeavors. Until Beijing or Moscow threatens this traditional strategic imperative,
<br>
Washington has some latitude to pursue other less-vital interests.
<br>
<p>America represents ideals of freedom, individual rights, and nonaggression. So, when these principles are violated,
<br>
other states look to the American response. The United States cannot react in every case where its principles are
<br>
flouted. But failing to act is not without cost-doubt is cast on whether the United States will defend its interests as
<br>
well as its principles.
<br>
<p>This does not represent a strategy for hegemony. The charge of American hegemonism is spurious and motivated by power
<br>
envy. The United States cannot hide its power. Nor should it. The exercise of American power from time to time will not
<br>
lead inexorably to a law of political physics whereby states always coalesce against the top dog in antihegemonist
<br>
entente. This is because the United States, unlike Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, is not bent on endangering others'
<br>
independence or freedom.
<br>
<p>Trade, human interchange, information flows, and international bodies can facilitate peace in many circumstances; these
<br>
conditions alone, however, do not preserve American interests or guarantee a war-free planet. America's global
<br>
engagement undergirds the international system.
<br>
<p>The global activism advocated here cannot be undertaken with the current shrunken military forces. General Henry H.
<br>
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently declared that during the past decade, spending and resources
<br>
had been reduced 40 percent and U.S. military commitments expanded 300 percent. Current expenditures for defense,
<br>
diplomacy, intelligence, and foreign assistance amount to slightly more than $325 billion-a large sum, but only 3
<br>
percent of our gross domestic product. The Defense Department's budget is about 15 percent of the total federal
<br>
budget-the great bulk of the budget is allocated for Social Security, Medicare, and other nondefense domestic programs.
<br>
<p>In rebuilding its defenses, the United States ought not to prepare solely for the humanitarian and peacekeeping
<br>
operations of the past decade. It must instead look to potential rivals. The western Pacific demands strategic
<br>
attention. Ships and planes capable of negotiating the vast oceanic distances are a first priority. The sea lanes around
<br>
Japan and Indonesia and in the Middle East must be kept open.
<br>
<p>Preserving America's preeminent standing is not an end in itself. But the longer the United States holds fast to its
<br>
position, the longer the world will be hospitable to free markets, political pluralism, and the rule of law. Together,
<br>
these political currents do as much for averting a global war as they do for extending American principles.
