</em><br>
<p>Actually, I don't think that's true Eliezer.  According to the Handbook
<br>
of Chemistry and Physics Chapter 5: Selected Values of Chemical Thermodynamic
<br>
Properties, going from carbon to diamond, the delta-H is 0.45 and the
<br>
delta-G is 0.69 (at STP).  So the reaction is endothermic and non-spontaneous
<br>
according to:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://xenon.che.ilstu.edu/genchemhelphomepage/topicreview/bp/ch21/gibbs.html">http://xenon.che.ilstu.edu/genchemhelphomepage/topicreview/bp/ch21/gibbs.html</a>
<br>
<p>So you do not get energy out of making diamond (at least from graphite).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's why diamonds are so hard - you have to expend that amount of energy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add it back in, before you can break the molecular bonds.
</em><br>
<p>If I understand what you are saying that isn't really true.  The hardness
<br>
of a material is determined by the bond strength, the orientation of interatomic
<br>
bonds and the bond density of the material.  Diamond and BN are two of the
<br>
hardest materials known because they have the smallest atoms and the greatest
<br>
bond density.  In contrast, I've been told that solid H2 is about as soft
<br>
as butter.
<br>
<p>Taking:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C + O2 --&gt; CO2
<br>
C has a delta-H of 0.45 and a delta-G of 0.69.
<br>
O2 has a 0 delta-H and delta-G
<br>
CO2 had dH and dG of ~-94.
<br>
So the reaction will be exothermic.
<br>
<p>Taking:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C + 2H2 --&gt; CH4
<br>
H2 has a dH and dG of 0.
<br>
CH4 has a dH of -15.9 and a dG of -12.1.
<br>
So this reaction will be exothermic as well.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;CH4 + O2 --&gt; CO2 + 2H2
<br>
<p>&nbsp;dH_products - dH_reactants = dH_rxn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(-94 + 0) - (-15.9 + 0) = -78.1
<br>
So, you get more energy out of burning diamond in oxygen (~-94)
<br>
than you get out of burning methane in oxygen (~-78).
<br>
<p>What I believe, Eli meant was that the production of diamondoid from
<br>
&quot;hydrogen-rich feedstock&quot; such as methane, is exothermic, e.g.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CH4 (methane) + O2 --&gt; C(diamondoid) + 2H2O
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(0.45+0) - (-15.9+0) = 16.35 
<br>
<p>Well, that isn't exothermic(!), so Eric is getting his 400 maJ per
<br>
atom (Nanosystems, pg 398) out of changes in the entropy in the
<br>
system (2 gases being converted into a solid and a liquid).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(0.57+18.2) - (44.5+49) = -74.7  (this is using the delta-S's)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Along with the concept of a diamondoid space suit goes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of diamond, not as expensive rocks dug up out of the ground, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a waste material produced by exothermic and exoergic nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing processes.
</em><br>
<p>Cough... But where did the hydrogen rich carbon feedstock come from?
<br>
<p>Yes, I know -- ultimately from sunlight.  But Eric does kind of gloss
<br>
over that detail in Nanosystems.  If you want this to be renewable
<br>
you don't want your hydrogen-rich feedstock to be coming out of the
<br>
ground.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What you do have with nanotechnology is the diamondoid recycling problem. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I pointed out at the last Foresight Gathering when the topic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycling came up, &quot;a diamond is not forever&quot;, but it's probably more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient to disintegrate it - take the energy output of a power plant or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a solar mirror and run the diamondoid material through en masse - rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than disassembling it atom-by-atom, as I've heard proposed.
</em><br>
<p>You don't have to add power, you just have to ignite it and it should
<br>
burn fine.  That is why sapphire nanobots are much more dangerous than
<br>
diamondoid nanobots -- sapphire doesn't burn, except perhaps in a
<br>
hydrogen rich atmosphere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of which, Robert, are you sure that it's possible to consume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diamond and oxygen as a fuel?
</em><br>
<p>Funny you should ask.  Nanomedicine, Table 6.1, pg 141 lists diamond
<br>
as having the &quot;highest known oxidative chemical storage density,
<br>
possibly surpassed only by fullerene materials&quot; (I question question
<br>
that since fullerene bond density is lower).
<br>
<p>It goes on to say, &quot;an injection of ~0.7 cm^3 of diamond colloid (the most
<br>
energy-dense chemical fuel known--it has been used as rocket fuel)
<br>
encapsulated in trillions of suitable submicron-scale biocompatible carrier
<br>
devices provides an energy resource equal in size to the entire serum
<br>
glucose supply...&quot;
<br>
<p>Too bad there isn't any citation on who was using diamond dust to power
<br>
rockets.  :-(
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you sure you aren't thinking of a rocket-suit that got you into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit by turning something else, maybe acetylene, into the diamondoid suit?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  I'm fairly sure what Eric had in mind was burning the contents
<br>
of the fuel tank, then burning the tank, then burning the rocket engines
<br>
themselves one by one (presumably one remains).  As the discussion
<br>
above shows, from a dH point of view diamond dust makes a great fuel.
<br>
Since its a solid + a gas going to a gas, there shouldn't be significant
<br>
entropy losses.
