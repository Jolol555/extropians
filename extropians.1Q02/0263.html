Hi,
<br>
<p>Just curious, are you actually recommending to us as a story of powerful
<br>
inspiration the life of an unreconstructed and defiant nazi?
<br>
<p>&quot;wisdom and inner strength at such a young age.&quot;
<br>
<p>um....

<em>&gt; Hello everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a very powerful autobiographical story Olaf Henny shared on cryonet.  This man as a boy resisted the intense pressures to join the Communist youth organization of his day.  I am astonished he could have had such wisdom and inner strength at such a young age.  If anyone deserves to be put in biostasis to see the future, it is Olaf Henny.  I believe the citizens of the future will be as astonished by him as the people of the present-day.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am responding to Mike Darwin's posting concerning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant achievements of Leni Riefenstahl in cinematic opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forming, without the benefit of having read any of the books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about her.  However I have personally been exposed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; euphoric atmosphere her film productions created among the German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public.  Even though I was just a small child at the time, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensed the powerful, uplifting impact they had on the adults in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While the architect Albert Speer designed the monumental setting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the parade grounds featured in &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the founder of the propaganda technique used in her films.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That was clearly the creation of 'Reichspropagandaminister Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joseph Goebbels', an unequalled genius in mass manipulation.  His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technique was later also widely used by the communist leadership.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was exposed to it on both sides, as an enthusiastic and willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; target by the Nazis* and later as a hostile exposed to communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propaganda.  The power of it is enormous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just a quick introduction to my situation at the time: In 1950 I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was one of only seven students in my school, who were still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refusing to join the FDJ, the communist youth organization, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found myself under immense pressure to do so.  Instead I changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools and ended up in a class, where there were 6 of us still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the outside.  Only a couple of month thereafter I was again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lone resisting student in my class.  I was clearly no friend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On occasion of the May 1st 1951 Workers Day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parade, we were marching in true totalitarian style, ten or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifteen abreast, past a stage occupied the then president of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GDR, Wilhelm Pieck, and his entourage. Chanting all around us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the loudspeaker proclaimed: &quot;The president of the German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democratic Republic salutes the students of the Goethe Schule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (our school)&quot;.  Around me everybody was clapping with hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised above their heads.  It was mass frenzy and although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resented the guy, as I have resented few in my life, my impulse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the time was to raise my hands and join in the clapping.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resisted and clenched my briefcase instead, but I realized then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how profound the impact of mass manipulation can be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does not work in our present situation, because the profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  building of a new world by a new generation  concept is missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or no longer credible as a mass movement setting.  In communism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was the  new world, where everybody has equal rights and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shares in the wealth for a better and brighter future.  With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazis it was the  prosperous future achieved through healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living and strengthening of body and mind in order to evolve into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a stronger people .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those, who were not there, and know of Nazi atrocities will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty understanding the mind set of the German people of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.  The 6 or 7 % of the population, who were directly exposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to those atrocities mostly disappeared quietly over night and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faded from the memories of the general population.  99% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of us had absolutely no idea, what was happening to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards and the fraction of one percent, who were directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in those atrocities, did well for themselves by not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about it, unless they wanted to share the fate of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *The rest of us (the then adults anyway) have experienced in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years prior to Hitler s election in 1932: 60 to 70% unemployment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; galloping inflation, during which you started in the morning after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negotiating a wage, which would feed the family for a day, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evening, when you got paid, it was barely enough to buy one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cigarette.  Tumults in the streets fist fights between Nazis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communists, the Weimar Republic out of control.  Then in just six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short years Germany rose from being the economically most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastated industrialized country to the one with the highest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living standard with full employment.  That was the foundation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the fanatic enthusiasm, with which the people supported the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazis, and why their believe in the final victory of Germany was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unwavering for so long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Albert Speer, Hitlers architect, is also credited with bringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the German war production into high gear and condemned for using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slave labour to achieve that.  In 1942, when he took over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the bombing of industrial plants in the from Britain easy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach Rhein/Rhur areas by the Allies started in earnest, the monthly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production of tanks (the smallish P4) was under 100.  By 1944 it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had risen to 400 of the much bigger Koenigstiger, despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relentless bombing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olaf
