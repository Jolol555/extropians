I agree with 90% of what Harvey wrote but I'll just follow up on one
<br>
issue:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore there is the risk that publishing software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; source code will give more information to the bad guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to allow them to design exploits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree here.  Security by obscurity does not work.  A closed source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application with many security holes will get abused more than an open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source application with few security holes.  If source code is published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and actually reviewed, as you point out), it will have most security holes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixed.  If a few slip by the experts, they will be fewer than the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holes in some closed source applications.  Microsoft has closed-source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software, and its holes are well-known and often exploited.
</em><br>
<p>There is a debate this morning on slashdot at
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/04/1629246">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/04/1629246</a> about an article
<br>
claiming that Linux has more security holes than Windows.  Apparently
<br>
the methodology used for counting security problems is problematic in
<br>
this claim, but here is an example of how one person explained the
<br>
difference:
<br>
<p>: Third: the study compares a kit of open-source software, which has
<br>
: received extensive peer review, to a closed-source product. It should
<br>
: surprise nobody that Linux has more documented problems than Windows:
<br>
: it's actually possible to go find vulnerabilities on Linux. Finding
<br>
: Windows vulnerabilities requires black-box reverse engineering.
<br>
<p>This is just one guy's opinion, but it is one I have run into quite a bit
<br>
among security developers.  It seems very plausible that it is easier
<br>
to find bugs in open-source software than in closed-source software.
<br>
That is the primary reason offered to hope that it can be made more
<br>
secure.  But clearly this can come back and hurt you in that it also
<br>
makes it easier for the bad guys to find flaws as well.
<br>
<p>Again the real issue is whether there is a well organized, active effort
<br>
to search out and fix bugs in the open source product.  Just publishing
<br>
the source will not automatically make that happen.  If you don't have
<br>
that, releasing source can actually hurt security.
<br>
