<em>&gt; &gt;As for my own life extension plans, I'd rather invest my life savings in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cryonic suspension than in staving off the 'old timers disease' for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;year or two. I've just gone through a year of dealing with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;grandmonsters at the end stage (grandma Burnett died a couple months ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;after years of light senility and recent hip and arm fractures, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;grandpa Burnett is still a nearly comatose alzheimers patient here in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;town, and likely will be for several years), and as my grandma Lorrey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;said recently, &quot;If I ever get like that, take me out behind the barn and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shoot me.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In my case, shoot me full of suspension fluid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Didn't you say you were leaving the list? Well, please don't. You make a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sense....more than many others on this list....
</em><br>
<p>No, that was JR who is leaving the list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I also very much would prefer the chance to be suspended before age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steals personhood from me....but are there any cryonicists who would not say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same....and who takes this oppurtunity from us? Our own brethren, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fellow citizens. However, I think that polls show that somewhat over 50% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all US voters favor legalized suicide....it is the politicians who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop us.
</em><br>
<p>I am pretty confident that immortality will be achieved before I reach
<br>
that stage. Average life expectancy for my grandmonsters generation is
<br>
at least in the 80's for my family, and I just turned 34 on the 19th, so
<br>
I've got another 40-50 years to go before I have to worry about mental
<br>
decay. If we haven't achieved practical immortality by then, then all of
<br>
our predictions are out the window anyways.
<br>
<p>Now, I'm not currently signed up for cryonics, mostly because I'm
<br>
unemployed and broke at the moment, but I've been saying for a while
<br>
that anything likely to kill me at this age is also likely to leave my
<br>
brain matter in poor condition, but I expect to get signed up as soon as
<br>
I regain employment.
