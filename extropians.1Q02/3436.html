<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sick of society at the moment; restrictions, idiocy, double

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; standards abound. Makes you want to set up afresh. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; traditional options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for doing so are not all that great:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a) build your own island in international waters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; b) get off-planet in large numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (c) design a way to do what you want while staying in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society by side-stepping, breaking and/or subverting the rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without getting  punished seriously for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One could argue that the virtual nation is (c). The only way, IMHO, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change society via (c) is to amass enough economic clout to make existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;portions of society listen. Anything else is wishful thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that a VN might help c).  See my response to Samantha 
<br>
elsewhere.  However, I am no longer interested in changing society on a 
<br>
large scale per se until I have the technology to do it *directly* :-}  But 
<br>
a VN (or VC for virtual community) *might* be a way to change one's 
<br>
*personal* society and survival prospects.  And you're right that economic 
<br>
clout is a prerequisite (along with technology) to having any effect at all 
<br>
on society.
<br>
<p>Have you read Hakim Bey's (Peter Lamborn Wilson) &quot;T.A.Z.&quot; (Temporary 
<br>
Autonomous Zones)?  Based on Situationist concepts from the 1960's on the 
<br>
&quot;derive&quot; and &quot;permanent party&quot;, it's a concept of forming free zones that 
<br>
are temporary and mobile.  I thought Bey was not convinced of the Net being 
<br>
of any real use in implementing the concept, but that was before 
<br>
peer-to-peer and MMORPGs which might change his mind.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;That too, but you'll notice while many advocate this, no-one has a working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network/culture with more than 10k people in it. Compare with virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nations that exist in games: 10k people is pocket change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am not a player but the space is much too limited and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constrained to be a real viable internet community, much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the framework for a new civlization.  Bad drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nope, not kidding. Put it this way: if 30-50% of your social interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time happens in place X, and there are 300,000 (or even a few thousand)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other people who say the same, I think you're going to have to start
</em><br>
<em>&gt;redefining words in order to deny that place X is not the center of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community.
</em><br>
<p><p>I do agree with you that 300,000 is definitely a community - even 10,000 is 
<br>
one.  I used to moderate a conference on the WELL in the 1980's and anyone 
<br>
there will tell you that the WELL is a community.  The question is:  Can 
<br>
you constrain the *kind* of community you build with game rules while 
<br>
*still* reflecting the real world enough to build a *real* community?
<br>
<p>The problem with the game notion being a basis for a VN, as I said to 
<br>
Samantha, is that the people are there to *play a game* - not to build a 
<br>
virtual world that reflects or interacts with the real world.  So you have 
<br>
a group of people in place.  But the more they reflect the real world, the 
<br>
more your game world will reflect the real world.  Not good if you intend 
<br>
to build some sort of lib community.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would note that EQ can be a &quot;stupid addictive mind-fuck game&quot; while also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being everything I say it is. &quot;stupid addictive mind-fuck game&quot; pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describes most people's experience with their meat lives too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Productive is as productive does. Any successful/skilled EQ player can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convert their EQ work time (i.e. time spent accumulating platinum, items,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leveling, etc) to meat world money quite efficiently, thank you, thanks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;black markets. There are real world groups that make a living doing just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this; one of them is sueing the makers of Dark Age of Camelot right now to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevent them banning such trades.
</em><br>
<p><p>Please detail how the Everquest people are engaging in black-market 
<br>
trade.  I'm very interested in this cross-over.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The thesis of my post was that people can pontificate and design
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bootstrapped virtual worlds all they like, and they'll be roundly ignored as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have been for decades. They're ignoring the herd of elephants (virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proto-nations based on games) next door. MMORPGs will spawn real virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nations; it seems all but inevitable at this point. The only question will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be which direction will they head in?
</em><br>
<p><p>This is precisely my concern.  I would suggest that there would be multiple 
<br>
VNs heading in all directions - just like the real world.  The interesting 
<br>
issues are:  will they come into conflict?  How?  Will the computer network 
<br>
protocols they run on keep them separate despite cross-overs of people from 
<br>
one to another - or hackers?  And will a proliferation of VNs make it 
<br>
easier to select your own desirable community?  Will the old lib 
<br>
&quot;proprietary community&quot; notion be realized here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So in theory, there's nothing stopping you making an MMORPG
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which guides and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rewards the formation of governing bodies of your choice, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fun to play. A libertarian twist on a traditional MMORPG, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because it is a game, it could garner a large and persistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; userbase/populance/part-time inhabitants within a few years. EverQuest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; boasts 300,000 subscribers, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes.  But you have to allow a lot of freedom, at least as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as in the real-world, to have a true virtual society/world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolve.  You need a set of basic &quot;physical&quot; laws and a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constraints on the inhabitants.  You also need that world to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taken seriously and have serious potential for real gain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; loss and the creation of real value.  It needs more than to just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be &quot;fun&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No you don't, no it doesn't. People build complex communities with intricate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rituals, histories and mores on FPS shooter servers, you know, let alone in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MMORPGs.
</em><br>
<p><p>That's true - but I'm not interested in wasting my precious survival time 
<br>
like they are on pointless pursuits.  There has to be a real-world benefit 
<br>
or why bother?  In the 1970's, I played one of the first &quot;Shoot Down the 
<br>
Airplane&quot; games on an Altair (or maybe it was a Processor Tech) - I wasted 
<br>
two hours on that and, realizing that games are an addicting waste of time, 
<br>
swore never to do it again.  I have played a couple games when I owned an 
<br>
Atari 520 ST, and I'm very impressed with the current crop of games which 
<br>
are more like movies than games - but that just means I'd waste even more 
<br>
time on them :-}
<br>
<p>On the other hand, how about SEX?  As I mentioned to Samantha, a VN built 
<br>
around a &quot;Virtual Sex-World&quot; would attract a LOT of people and probably be 
<br>
enormously profitable...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd suggest you bite the bullet and dive in and play some of these games for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a little while. Do some research. If you think that people don't take these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;game worlds seriously, that the level of rules and laws are inconsistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with real societies, then you definately need to go look at the communities.
</em><br>
<p><p>I guess I'll have to do some research, since the notion intrigues me as a 
<br>
means of revenue generation [I'm on Welfare at the moment :-}]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;All of which is currently researched, white papered, planned, theorized,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outlined, and in some cases actually prototyped. Go research.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree.  The bandwidth and computation issues can be resolved within five 
<br>
or ten years with optical networking, Linux Beowulf cluster technology, and 
<br>
more work on true distributed computing.  Intel is projecting 20GHz PCs 
<br>
within three years.
<br>
<p>BTW, the open-source people are reverse-engineering Microsoft's .NET to 
<br>
insure that the open-source community such as Linux can interoperate with 
<br>
it.  I'd back that since I *don't* want Microsoft honeycombing *my* VN with 
<br>
their spyware and security flaws.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I've always said you singularitarians have your clocks wound too tight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Barring someone getting lucky with a hard takeoff, society as a whole isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to roll out a singularity within the next ten to twenty years.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree.  My estimate is at the low end 2020 and more likely around 2050 
<br>
give or take ten years.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; You need real goods beyond entertainment items that are produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within the VR and real goods that flow in the reverse direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if you are going to effectively create a new kind of society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virtual space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would this be? Have you checked the internation money flows for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tangibles vrs intangibles recently?
</em><br>
<p>As for entertainment goods, again, how about SEX?  A VN with complete 
<br>
sexual freedom and potent scenarios would attract many participants - more 
<br>
than anything else I can think of.  The resulting economic clout - look at 
<br>
the 15 million porn sites bringing in billions.  For *real* clout, however, 
<br>
you would need to enter the financial markets, as you indicated, or have an 
<br>
effect somehow at large commercial/industrial market exchanges and 
<br>
ecommerce.  But sex would be a huge jump-start...
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;---&gt; the animated silicon love doll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What do we export? How would the being a citizen of this virtual nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work? Would it be my house/apartment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seceding from the US (or wherever)? How would that work if I was renting my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;home, or living with my parents (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I do)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You get whatever the virtual nation can muscle out of existing nations via
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply having stuff to trade. Dual citizenship, preferential treatment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;access to money markets. Like being an ex-pat. As soon as sufficient flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across borders exists, money changers spring up. So get paid in virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currency, avoid real nation income taxes, use money changers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can see income taxes being the first line of battle, actually. If you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a significant body of people productively working in a virtual nation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not paying much in the way of income taxes to the real nation, that's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to put noses out of joint.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't expect a VN to really be able to muscle any serious concessions out 
<br>
of real states - they'll go to war first.  You have to be able to threaten 
<br>
the real state in the real world with real technology.  Remember - the real 
<br>
states have real guns and those guns work without computers.  However, real 
<br>
personal benefits such as tax evasion could accrue in the physical world, I 
<br>
agree.
