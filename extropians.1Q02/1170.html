<p>I and my Significant Other have been living together for 16 years.  We are not
<br>
married.  I don't know of any domestic partner laws in California that would
<br>
allow us to register for those benefits without getting married.  We're not
<br>
over 65, so that may be what you mean by &quot;various non-gay partnerings&quot;.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It can also be pointed out that hetero unions

</em><br>
<p>California is not one of these.  (People always ask &quot;Doesn't California have
<br>
Common Law marriage?&quot;)  If you tell people you are married, then after a while
<br>
it becomes true.  No ceremony, no certificate, etc.  If you maintain that you
<br>
are not married, and don't file together, and make sure everyone knows you
<br>
aren't married, then you're not married.  The laws vary from place to place,
<br>
but that's the fact in California.  We're not married.  In some places, living
<br>
together as a couple would be sufficient for one of us to claim that we were
<br>
married against the other's wishes, or for the government to insist that it
<br>
were true, and force us to accept the benefits of that status.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I have never known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a HR department to demand a marriage license as proof of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eligibility for work related partner benefits of apparently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straight couples.  So I don't think there is that much of a case 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for what you describe.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, we could get work-related benefits by saying we were married.  But
<br>
then we would be, and the IRS could make us file as a couple rather than as
<br>
individuals.  Every time I've asked, and every time my SO has asked, the
<br>
answer has been &quot;spouses only&quot;.  If were in SF (I'm reasonably sure) or
<br>
Berkeley (I assume) we could get benefits if we were gay and registered
<br>
partners.  I don't know of any place where we've worked or lived where that's
<br>
been true.
