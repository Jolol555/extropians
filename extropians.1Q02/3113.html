<p><p>Hermits and Cranks
<br>
Fifty years ago Martin Gardner launched the modern skeptical movement.
<br>
Unfortunately, much of what he wrote about is still current today

<br>
<p><p>Martin Gardner's book In the Name of Science is the bible of the modern
<br>
skeptical movement.
<br>
<p>In 1950 Martin Gardner published an article in the Antioch Review entitled
<br>
&quot;The Hermit Scientist,&quot; about what we would today call pseudoscientists. It
<br>
was Gardner's first publication of a skeptical nature (he was the math
<br>
games columnist for Scientific American for more than a quarter of a
<br>
century). In 1952 he expanded it into a book called In the Name of Science,
<br>
with the descriptive subtitle &quot;An entertaining survey of the high priests
<br>
and cultists of science, past and present.&quot; Published by Putnam, the book
<br>
sold so poorly that it was quickly remaindered and lay dormant until 1957,
<br>
when it was republished by Dover. It has come down to us as Fads and
<br>
Fallacies in the Name of Science, which is still in print and is arguably
<br>
the skeptic classic of the past half a century.
<br>
<p>Thankfully, there has been some progress since Gardner offered his first
<br>
criticisms of pseudoscience. Now largely antiquated are his chapters on
<br>
believers in a flat earth, a hollow earth, Atlantis and Lemuria, Alfred
<br>
William Lawson, Roger Babson, Trofim Lysenko, Wilhelm Reich and Alfred
<br>
Korzybski. But disturbingly, a good two thirds of the book's contents are
<br>
relevant today, including Gardner's discussions of homeopathy, naturopathy,
<br>
osteopathy, iridiagnosis (reading the iris of the eye to determine bodily
<br>
malfunctions), food faddists, cancer cures and other forms of medical
<br>
quackery, Edgar Cayce, the Great Pyramid's alleged mystical powers,
<br>
handwriting analysis, ESP and PK (psychokinesis), reincarnation, dowsing
<br>
rods, eccentric sexual theories, and theories of group racial differences.
<br>
<p><p>The &quot;hermit scientist,&quot; a youthful Gardner wrote, works alone and is
<br>
ignored by mainstream scientists. &quot;Such neglect, of course, only
<br>
strengthens the convictions of the self-declared genius.&quot; But Gardner was
<br>
wrong by half in his prognostications: &quot;The current flurry of discussion
<br>
about Velikovsky and Hubbard will soon subside, and their books will begin
<br>
to gather dust on library shelves.&quot; Adherents to Immanuel Velikovsky's
<br>
views on how celestially caused global catastrophes shaped the beliefs of
<br>
ancient humans are a quaint few surviving in the interstices of fringe
<br>
culture. L. Ron Hubbard, however, has been canonized by the Church of
<br>
Scientology as the founding saint of a world religion.
<br>
<p>In 1952 Gardner could not have known that the nascent flying saucer craze
<br>
would turn into an alien industry: &quot;Since flying saucers were first
<br>
reported in 1947, countless individuals have been convinced that the earth
<br>
is under observation by visitors from another planet.&quot; Absence of evidence
<br>
then was no more a barrier to belief than it is today, and ufologists
<br>
proffered the same conspiratorial explanations for the dearth of proof: &quot;I
<br>
have heard many readers of the saucer books upbraid the government in no
<br>
uncertain terms for its stubborn refusal to release the 'truth' about the
<br>
elusive platters. The administration's 'hush hush policy' is angrily cited
<br>
as proof that our military and political leaders have lost all faith in the
<br>
wisdom of the American people.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even then Gardner was bemoaning that some beliefs never seem to go out of
<br>
vogue, as he recalled an H. L. Mencken quip from the 1920s: &quot;Heave an egg
<br>
out of a Pullman window, and you will hit a Fundamentalist almost anywhere
<br>
in the U.S. today.&quot; Gardner cautions that when religious superstition
<br>
should be on the wane, it is easy &quot;to forget that thousands of high school
<br>
teachers of biology, in many of our southern states, are still afraid to
<br>
teach the theory of evolution for fear of losing their jobs.&quot; Today
<br>
creationism has spread northward and mutated into the oxymoronic form of
<br>
&quot;creation science.&quot;
<br>
<p>And the motives of the hermit scientists have not changed either. Gardner
<br>
recounts the day that Groucho Marx interviewed Louisiana state senator
<br>
Dudley J. LeBlanc about a &quot;miracle&quot; cure-all vitamin-and-mineral tonic
<br>
called Hadacol that the senator had invented. When Groucho asked the
<br>
senator what it was good for, LeBlanc answered with surprising honesty: &quot;It
<br>
was good for five and a half million for me last year.&quot;
<br>
<p>What I find especially valuable about Gardner's views are his insights into
<br>
the differences between science and pseudoscience. On the one extreme we
<br>
have ideas that are most certainly false, &quot;such as the dianetic view that a
<br>
one-day-old embryo can make sound recordings of its mother's conversation.&quot;
<br>
In the borderlands between the two &quot;are theories advanced as working
<br>
hypotheses, but highly debatable because of the lack of sufficient data.&quot;
<br>
Of these Gardner selects a most propitious example: &quot;the theory that the
<br>
universe is expanding.&quot; That theory would now fall at the other extreme end
<br>
of the spectrum, where lie &quot;theories almost certainly true, such as the
<br>
belief that the earth is round or that men and beasts are distant cousins.&quot;
<br>
<p>How can we tell if someone is a scientific crank? Gardner offers this
<br>
advice: (1) &quot;First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
<br>
in almost total isolation from their colleagues.&quot; Cranks typically do not
<br>
understand how the scientific process operatesthat they need to try out
<br>
their ideas on colleagues, attend conferences and publish their hypotheses
<br>
in peer-reviewed journals before announcing to the world their startling
<br>
discovery. Of course, when you explain this to them they say that their
<br>
ideas are too radical for the conservative scientific establishment to
<br>
accept. (2) &quot;A second characteristic of the pseudo-scientist, which greatly
<br>
strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward paranoia,&quot; which manifests
<br>
itself in several ways:
<br>
<p>(1) He considers himself a genius. (2) He regards his colleagues, without
<br>
exception, as ignorant blockheads.... (3) He believes himself unjustly
<br>
persecuted and discriminated against. The recognized societies refuse to
<br>
let him lecture. The journals reject his papers and either ignore his books
<br>
or assign them to &quot;enemies&quot; for review. It is all part of a dastardly plot.
<br>
It never occurs to the crank that this opposition may be due to error in
<br>
his work.... (4) He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the
<br>
greatest scientists and the best-established theories. When Newton was the
<br>
outstanding name in physics, eccentric works in that science were violently
<br>
anti-Newton. Today, with Einstein the father-symbol of authority, a crank
<br>
theory of physics is likely to attack Einstein.... (5) He often has a
<br>
tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many cases making use of terms
<br>
and phrases he himself has coined.
<br>
<p>We should keep these criteria in mind when we explore controversial ideas
<br>
on the borderlands of science. &quot;If the present trend continues,&quot; Gardner
<br>
concludes, &quot;we can expect a wide variety of these men, with theories yet
<br>
unimaginable, to put in their appearance in the years immediately ahead.
<br>
They will write impressive books, give inspiring lectures, organize
<br>
exciting cults. They may achieve a following of oneor one million. In any
<br>
case, it will be well for ourselves and for society if we are on our guard
<br>
against them.&quot; So we still are, Martin. That is what skeptics do, and in
<br>
tribute for all you have done, we shall continue to honor your founding
<br>
command.
