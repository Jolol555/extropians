Reason:
<br>
<em>&gt;Anyhow. &quot;War on *&quot; = stupid. Not even evil, just stupid, stupid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupid. We live in a sick, controlling society that encourages denial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a lack of responsibility, can't look beyond tomorrow, curtails
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedoms for idiot reasons and looks more and more like the worst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Europe. Career politicians are a major source of stupidity, popularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contents are no way to run a society. Blah, blah, blah, heard it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before, possibly even from me, what are we going to do about it?
</em><br>
<p>Once upon a time in my (alot) younger days, I planned a libertarian
<br>
community with a group of friends in Boulder, Colorado where we (15 of
<br>
us) would build and live following our libertarian (Friedman, Hayak,
<br>
etc.)  principles, trade services (such as teach each other's kids,
<br>
'sell' our skills), using our own currency with each other, and so
<br>
on. We never actually did it, with the exception of using only our own
<br>
money with each other for awhile, but we had great fun putting the
<br>
pieces together about how it would work.
<br>
<p>To answer your 'what are we going to do about it?', at the moment, I
<br>
can only give the lame response: &quot;remove the State as much as possible
<br>
from your daily life.&quot;
<br>
<p>(Filling in the details are left to imaginative reader :-} )
<br>

<br>
<p>BTW: One large reason among several for me deciding not to return to
<br>
live in the U.S. is the U.S government's current &quot;War on *&quot;
<br>
stupidities.  There's a bit more sane attitude about that nonsense in
<br>
Europe. But maybe not for long.
