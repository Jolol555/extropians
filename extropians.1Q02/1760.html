<em>&gt; Subject: Re: New member: Arona Ndiaye
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greetings !!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I indeed live in the Netherlands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was born in Paris, lived in France ( Normandy in the North: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cows + rain + 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more cows ... ) until the age of 8. My grandma who raised me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decided to die 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one day while I was on holidays in Senegal ( most western 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point in Africa. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The capital is Dakar ). So I stayed in Senegal ( being a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ping-pong ball 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between my divorced parents: dad Psychologist, mum business 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woman ) for 13 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years. My mum is half French/half Senegalese, her name is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name I bear. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to my grandfather, my name ( NDIAYE) is directly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linked to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruling family of kings a millennia ago. Tribe would be a mix 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Wolof and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Serere and maybe Toucouleur. In 1994 I had my A-levels or the French 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent of it. I was 21, did not want to go to University. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I first wanted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cover the war in Rwanda as a photographer. Mum said: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Forget it&quot;. So I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went to London. Lived there for a few years. Very nasty car 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crash in 1996, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girlfriend was driving, her brother + g/f in the back. I am the sole 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survivor. Right lung got 'slightly' damaged, part of my knees 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shattered. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Verdict: you'll live but we need to operate your lung; on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will never walk again. I laughed at them. Lung got fixed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got myself some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new cyborg(half) knees and went to spend some time with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mother of my g/f 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some huge castle in Scotland. Private nurse team etc.... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Used to wait till 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone was asleep, would roll in my chair (it's got wheels 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you use one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you cannot use your legs, dunno what it's called.... oh !!!! a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wheelchair =) to the pool outside and would throw myself in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the water. 6 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks later, I could feel below my knees again. Two weeks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing up. By the end of 1997 I was given 18 months to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live. Born premature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (5 month + 28 days ), 965 grams. Right lung stopped growing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I was 13 or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so.  It so happened that my pulmonary capacity was decreasing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a constant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion. Doctors said: &quot;by mid 1998 you'll need to carry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oxygen supplies on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you. My then pregnant girlfriend swallowed 40 valiums: g/f 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone, so was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baby. Called a friend in Amsterdam: I'm loosing it. Can i pop 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ? Got  there, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took the first job I could find: tech support for Palm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computing. Smoked 20 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joints/day, spent my weekends with MDMA and Uk-Garage in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clubs. Stopped all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medication and got ready to die hehehe. Hasn't happened yet. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's how I got 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Holland. If I bore some of you: apologies. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arona,
</em><br>
