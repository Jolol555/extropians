<em>&gt;From: Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20economics%20of%20Star%20Trek">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, science fiction is propaganda about how the future *should*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look, or how it *might* look, as the author sees it, given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain set of circumstances. Star Trek is presented as a glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future to live in, where nobody is poor, sick, maligned, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignorant. Everybody is beautiful, there is food and wine aplenty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the entire galaxy is the oyster of everyone. To proclaim this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society as 'communist', and that the Star Trek world is great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*specifically because it is* would therefore lend the dead concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of communism a level of credibility it doesn't deserve, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just the sort of romanticizing that Hakim Bey was talking about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projecting a 'golden age' in the future on an ideology which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obviously not making anyone happy today.
</em><br>
<p>On Star Trek, all you normally see are the people aboard the
<br>
starships, they are clearly military or the equivalent of the
<br>
military. When you do see non-Star Fleet people, like Piccard's
<br>
brother and the winery, or Sisko's father and his restaurant, you
<br>
see the results of a thriving free market economy.
<br>
<p>The politically correct Star Trek, i.e. &quot;Voyager&quot;, I could barely
<br>
stand to watch, which is too bad since they had a few great tech
<br>
concepts.
<br>
<p>I think in the future we will eliminate hunger, poverty,
<br>
illiteracy, and dramatically improve healthcare for everyone, but
<br>
it will not be Communism nor it's ugly cousin Socialism or it's
<br>
lying twin &quot;Economic Democracy&quot; that get us there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So, lets look at communism today. I suggest reading Ann Marlowe's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;piece on salon.com:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2002/02/07/cuba_milk/index.h">http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2002/02/07/cuba_milk/index.h</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tml
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Where she reports on the neglect of puppies, the price of milk,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the prevalence of prostitution and racial injustice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Castro's Cuban Communist Paradise. Truth is always a good antidote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to disinformation propaganda, and Marlowe's reporting is powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medicine indeed.
</em><br>
<p>The simple fact is that Cuba can trade with every other country in
<br>
the world. There are countries that trade with Cuba just to slight
<br>
the U.S., but Cuba is still an economic hellhole and will remain so
<br>
as long as it's run by a totalitarian dictator with a defunct
<br>
economic theory.
<br>
<p>Castro will continue to pretend that the reason Cuba is poor is
<br>
because of U.S. sanctions. Despite the fact that they have nothing
<br>
to do with it.
<br>
<p>If the Palestinians ever begin to get their act together I expect
<br>
their first act will be to hold out their hands for a handout from
<br>
the &quot;Great Satan&quot;. In fact I'll cover the bets...
