<em>&gt;From: Anders Sandberg &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20The%20Politics%20of%20Transhumanism">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;To sum up: yes, I believe there is a one true transhumanism that has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greater claim to the name than other ideologies (which is rather broad,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but has some core ideas you have to believe in to be a transhumanist).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A definition of transhumanism as merely being in favor of radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological progress does not have the same claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My claim in the paper was that humanism is integral to the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism, and if you leave out the humanism part you are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talking about transhumanism. Part of this is purely semantic, since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humanism part of the term transhumanism ought to signify something.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is semantic, but there is a deeper truth here too.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism without humanism is not transhumanism, you say - I might 
<br>
agree, but that is just an arbitrary definition.
<br>
<p>Why do I say that?
<br>
<p>We already have various political interpretations of transhumanism as 
<br>
described, for instance, in J. Hughes paper and some of those 
<br>
interpretations seem to care little for humanism. And lets not forget the 
<br>
Russian bolshevik cosmists (clearly among transhumanism's many  
<br>
forefathers).
<br>
<p>How did that happen, then?
<br>
<p>What they all did was exactly what I worry about: they adopted what I call 
<br>
the central meme of transhumanism (i.e. it is right to use technology to go 
<br>
beyond Homo Sapiens) and dropped the rest.
<br>
<p>You want to promote a humanist agenda for transhumanism, and that is ok with 
<br>
me. But I would expect that other ideologies, while slower at present in 
<br>
doing so, will also adopt-and-adapt transhumanism's central meme, possibly 
<br>
in ways that you (and I!) might not like.
<br>
<p>My warning, here, is that one of the central memes (possibly THE central 
<br>
meme) of transhumanism is up for grabs...
<br>
<p>I must admit, however, that the fact that humanists and libertarians were 
<br>
the first to adopt transhumanist ideas is a reassuring fact that might bode 
<br>
well for the future...
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Fabio
