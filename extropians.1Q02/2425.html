</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant part:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Does the ability to earn money really vary by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;factor of a million from person to person, in their own right?  How much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of that variance is from the person, and how much from the position in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;society they happen to occupy, which any non-moron could exploit?  If a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lot comes from the position (no one would say it all does, but a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;might), then we could contemplate a society with fewer bottlenecks to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;occupied by lottery.  (Or more but less lucrative ones.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plainly, societal infrastructure plays a necessary but not sufficient role in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating large inequalities in wealth.  Among hunter-gatherers, even someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twice as smart, strong, and liked as his peers will not own billions more in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets than his peers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beyond that, I'm at a loss for hard measures of the relative influence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance, innate ability, acquired virtues, and societal infrastructure in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating disparities in wealth.  Perhaps social scientists can measure such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things; I cannot say, as it is not my field of study.  But I wax skeptical.
</em><br>
<p>I have been listening, of late, to financial advisor Suze Ormon's CDs on
<br>
smart personal finance. She says that a law of finance is that money is
<br>
attracted to respect. People who treat money with respect attract more
<br>
of it, and those who do not repel it.
<br>
<p>Certainly if the lowly masses continue to disrespect money by believing
<br>
in stupid communist fantasies, they will continue to repel money in
<br>
their daily lives, and that money will continue to be attracted most,
<br>
like interstellar gasses to massive star formations and black holes, to
<br>
individuals who demonstrate in their every act and statement their high
<br>
respect for the proper treatment of money.
<br>
<p>In this way, you can apply a sort of gravitation law to the behavior of
<br>
money. Most people are minor asteroidal fragments or little chunks of
<br>
interstellar ice and dust. Some people coalesce into large asteroids and
<br>
comets. Still others form into protoplanets and terrestrial planets and
<br>
moons. Only a few become jovian planets and stars...
