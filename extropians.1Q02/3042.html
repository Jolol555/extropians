<em>&gt;Robert J. Bradbury asks:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;So I'm curious...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Who wants to join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I-Will-One-Day-Be-A-Millionaire Foundation?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and is willing to walk their talk?
</em><br>
<p>Not to mention talking their walk.
<br>
<p>I'm glad to see this subject come up once again.
<br>
<p>Part of a well balanced extropian life is sound financial
<br>
management with extensive planning for the future.
<br>
<p>Personally, I start with 10% of my pre-tax income going off to the
<br>
401K which is never touched for any reason. I have a previous fund
<br>
(Van Kampen emerging growth) which is high risk, so my new current
<br>
fund is 80% stock 20% bonds. (with a 40% match in company stock)
<br>
<p>I maintain funds in a money market account for emergencies which go
<br>
off to CD's above a three months supply of backup funds. These come
<br>
from a second 10% I take off from the top. If you have credit card
<br>
debt take half of this second 10% and pay it off.
<br>
<p>Once you start doing this you will find you don't even miss these
<br>
funds.
<br>
<p>Along with the sources Max has mentioned, I recommend the book that
<br>
completely changed the way I deal with money, David Chilton's &quot;The
<br>
Wealthy Barber&quot;.
<br>
<p>Don't forget to take a small portion of that first 10% and use it
<br>
for membership in the Extropy institute.
