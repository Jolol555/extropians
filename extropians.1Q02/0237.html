<br>
<em>&gt; I disagree with you.  It is inappropriate for all occasions.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least in English, there's no idea or concept that requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profanity to be expressed unambiguously.  There's always a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or collection of words that can be used instead of the profanity.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<p>This is does not appear to me to be exactly correct.  Consider 
<br>
the subject line of the thread currently just above this.  I 
<br>
don't know what it's about, but the subject line, which I shall 
<br>
paraphrase as the fecal extrusion of a male bovine, lets me know 
<br>
immediatlely that I'm not interested in the thread.  &quot;Nonsense&quot;, 
<br>
which would appear to have about the same connotative meaning 
<br>
would not have conveyed this message.
<br>
<p>More to the point, just because there is more than one way to do 
<br>
something does not automatically imply that any particular one 
<br>
of those ways should always be avoided.
<br>
<p>&quot;Profanity considered really dumb&quot; is just about correct.  This 
<br>
is different from a blanket statement.  This is not a claim that 
<br>
one can always effectively substitute another term which has the 
<br>
same connotation and the same denotation.  (If you could, I will 
<br>
assert that it would offend you equally.)
<br>
<p>That said, there appears to be some internal human wiring that 
<br>
links being a low status male with scatology.  Perhaps in other 
<br>
cultures it is linked instead with blasphemy (some historical 
<br>
records seem to indicate this).  So I could be that the linkage 
<br>
is with tabooed verbage.  In that case what is being expressed 
<br>
is, in essence, rage at one's powerlessness.  This is typical 
<br>
for adolescent and other low status males.  (The power structure 
<br>
tends to sit heavily upon them, and they tend to resent it even 
<br>
more that would seem reasonable to an external observer.)  Your 
<br>
dictum is basically saying &quot;this is another place where your 
<br>
presence is not welcome&quot;.  To an extent this is understandable, 
<br>
as the utterances are expressions of rage, and thus 
<br>
intentionally objectionable.  But I feel that a more restrained 
<br>
request that they not appear in the subject lines would 
<br>
accomplish 90% of the goal without further denegrating people 
<br>
who already feel quite put upon.  (I would not claim that 
<br>
adolescent females are less put upon, merely that they tend to 
<br>
react with less rage, or at least that they express it in 
<br>
different ways.)
<br>
<p>If you had merely said &quot;I always find profanity offensive, and I 
<br>
sure wish that they would stop&quot; one would have a hard time 
<br>
arguing with the position, but this is different from the claim 
<br>
that they are always inappropriate.  Logical reasoning is a 
<br>
small part of what human discussions are about.
