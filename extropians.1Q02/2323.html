<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So goes the litany of evils that so many Americans seem to project upon

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You know what is the strangest thing? The people who foam most strongly

<em>&gt; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the mouth when screeching about the evils of society are those who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; benefitted most from it. Those who have been born into the richer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; who have gained their wealth and knowledge from countless generations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; before them, demand that they alone be recognised as being the creators

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; their good fortune and that they are damned if they will share it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Can you prove otherwise? Government has always operated more as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hindrance to individuals attaining wealth than a help. How, in fact, did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government give Bill Gates $60 billion? How has it given Harvey, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brent, or any other successful extropian their wealth. Every one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will demonstrate how they worked their butts off for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does Bill really need $60 billion?  Sheesh, won't a paltry couple of billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do anymore?
</em><br>
<p>How does this question pertain to the debate at hand? We were debating
<br>
whether government helps or hinders people getting rich. &quot;Need&quot; is
<br>
completely irrelevant when it comes to exercising ones natural human
<br>
rights. You don't &quot;Need&quot; to freely speak, or vote, or live free of
<br>
government searches, or own a home, or a car, or a toothbrush, do you?
<br>
Explain how you have a greater need of these things than any private
<br>
citizen does to make as much money as they are honestly capable of doing
<br>
through their own work and creativity.
<br>
<p>Using &quot;need&quot; to rationalize away property rights is the hallmark of
<br>
socialist confiscatory-think. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While I don't deny that there are those who make a career of feeding at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the public trough, and some of the smart ones even get rich at it, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the overwhelming majority do so just to avoid doing real work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted, again, this is from my own personal experience ... but it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming majority of rich people I've known who have avoided doing real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work and it is the middle class or poorer people I've observed who have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most work, often to ease the life for the &quot;poor&quot; rich blokes.
</em><br>
<p>You only see how rich people behave once they've gotten rich (and only
<br>
those who you KNOW are rich). The vast majority of the wealth in the US
<br>
is self-made. Far more millionaires earned it themselves than inherited
<br>
it. Are you then claiming that slavery is wrong, but only when applied
<br>
to a person's first $30,000 of income? Enslaving the labor of self made
<br>
rich people is okay?
