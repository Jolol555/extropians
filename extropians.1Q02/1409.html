From: Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Integrated%20Military">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;The Navy had the worst problems during the Gulf War. I read that at
<br>
least 2/3 of the naval women in the Gulf got pregnant before the end of
<br>
the war and had to be sent home (well, with all those seamen running
<br>
around whaddya expect? ;) ). I would be for a regulation that says that
<br>
in order to serve in a combat position, you must agree to a Norplant or
<br>
other such device during combat operations.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This is a problem that has continued...even at shore commands.
<br>
Part of the problem is that under the old model (i.e. stag navy)
<br>
you could allow the active-duty members to procreate and
<br>
collect suitable entitlements without them being limited duty.
<br>
Another problem that we see is the prevalence of junior
<br>
female enlisteds who find it expedient to become pregnant
<br>
as a means of getting out of base housing (similar &quot;rapid
<br>
courtships&quot; happen for the same reason..).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly the navy has another, more subtle problem.
<br>
Historically a large proportion of navy medical's officers
<br>
promote from below, go mustang, whatever. I have 
<br>
heard considerable grumbling about the Navy becoming
<br>
an adjunct to welfare. This is creating a talent drain as
<br>
the most talented simply exit the system once they've
<br>
finished whatever educational commitments they have.
<br>
This is more of a problem in NavyMed as interact with
<br>
both members AND dependants, do immunizations and
<br>
pediatrics, OB/GYN, all that. They SEE the social
<br>
context where other sailors see only an active-duty
<br>
only work environment and of course their own
<br>
friend's families.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if it is possible for the Fleet to function
<br>
as the gender-blind, gender-irrelevant machine social 
<br>
architects would prefer.. but I do know one thing..
<br>
the implimentation of what we presently have sucks
<br>
mightily!  It's getting the point that enlisted's are turning
<br>
down navy money for grad school and going into debt
<br>
on their own..just to avoid going back in as khakis :)
<br>
These should be the ones who should be Fleet heart and soul...
<br>
and instead.. the lifers, not the fire-eaters are those who
<br>
remain..all via a malevolent attrition.
