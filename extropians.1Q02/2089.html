<p>The problem is one of costs versus benefits. If other people get more
<br>
benefits from my using a newer application than I do, especially if the
<br>
benefits they get are to my detriment, then newer is not necessarily
<br>
better. The newer browser applications provide marketing data to others
<br>
at the cost of my privacy, they provide security loopholes to others at
<br>
the expense of my data and money when exploited against me, so the extra
<br>
'features' provided are actually of rather marginal benefit, if not
<br>
totally negative.
<br>
<p>For this reason, I will not use Outlook, Explorer, or the 6+ versions of
<br>
Aolscape (formerly Netscape). I do not betch and whine about it, I am
<br>
perfectly happy with the choice I've made. Those who see nothing wrong
<br>
with following, lemminglike, into the borganism of total transparency
<br>
make their own choices. Newer is not necessarily better.
