Brian -- this is offlist since you likely haven't rcvd
<br>
my ranting response to Eugene -- complementing that comment
<br>
with your comments...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All well and good, but it doesn't explain why one superintelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their civilization wouldn't, out of the goodness of its non-heart,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take half a second of realtime to design and construct a small,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicating (as it encounters new solar systems), fast nanoprobe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that should by this point in time completely spread itself through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our galaxy
</em><br>
<p>I have no problem with what you are discussing up to the word
<br>
&quot;replicating&quot;.  If you want &quot;trust&quot; you want brothers &amp; sisters,
<br>
not &quot;children&quot;.  (There would be some interesting sociology
<br>
here to look at statistics of relationship &quot;symbiosis&quot; between
<br>
siblings vs. parent-child (or more specifically child-&gt;parent)
<br>
relationships.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; helping out and uploading (or whatever is &quot;best&quot;) the species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it runs across.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.  Absorbing foreign technologies and experience
<br>
makes for more survivable entities (look at mitochondria
<br>
and chloroplasts).  But it is questionable whether such
<br>
mergings would grant some subset of the mergents replication
<br>
rights.  The Borg assimilate -- but they don't grant the
<br>
assimilated &quot;free will&quot;.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that for an ATC to produce an expansionary
<br>
perspective it must give up a survival perspective.  If
<br>
it gives up a survival perspective (embracing an Extropic
<br>
evolve as fast as you can perspective?) then they may
<br>
tip off the edge of the cliff as fast as they come into
<br>
existence.
<br>
<p>One has to create a balance between evolving and surviving.
<br>
<p>I don't yet currently see how individuals (or civilizations)
<br>
can make those choices in a non-destructive fashion (without
<br>
imposing some rather draconian solutions).
<br>
<p>Robert
