<em>&gt; &gt; Overall, an enjoyable little website. There should really be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more sites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like this for other questions (right now I'm reading a book about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; animal rights movement, and it has some interesting examples of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tricky the issue of deciding what beings have rights and on what basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is; it would probably make a good &quot;battleground ethics&quot; setup). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How bizzarre... I am reading &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; by Peter Singer at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment. Same issues. Same book?
</em><br>
<p>Hardly. Per Svensson makes mincemeat out of Singer, and shows some of
<br>
the less palatable sides of his and other animal rights philosopher's
<br>
ideas. The problem isn't that they are deliberately anti-humanistic -
<br>
very few consider themselves that - but that their ideas do lead in that
<br>
direction. 
<br>
<p>Especially Singer's utilitarianism has some rather awful implications.
<br>
It is hard to avoid with utilitarianism since it does not place much
<br>
value in individual lives but rather on the aggregate level. And of
<br>
course, who gets to decide what increases utility the most?
<br>
Utilitarianism has a very strong centralist bias. While Singer is very
<br>
careful to point out possible slippery slopes when it comes to eating
<br>
crayfish (which *might* be able to experience pain, and if we start to
<br>
allow ourselves to eat them, we might start eating fish, and then meat),
<br>
he handwaves away slippery slopes when it comes to his proposals for
<br>
eutanizing malformed children (apparently there is no risk that this
<br>
practice will be extended to other undesirable humans, in his view).
<br>
Slippery slope arguments are not per se valid, but it is interesting to
<br>
see here that Singer allows himself quite a bit of freedom in
<br>
interpreting what is risky and what is not - would the same kind of
<br>
freedom to decide (with little or no ethical reasoning) apply to the
<br>
definers of the common ethics advocaded by many utilitiarians?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that the ethical questions raised have are very strong in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context of transhumanism, moreso than other philosophies, in that we support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morphological freedom, and thus must regard where we are now (human) as t(i)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (where i is some positive integer) in an iterative process. This implies far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less weight given to current qualities of humanity in determining who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covered by concepts such as the Principle of Equality... any criteria based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on current human abilities must look entirely arbitrary. Thus with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to beings with below human levels of intelligence, which are otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather similar to us (eg: mammals), it is difficult to see where lines could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rightly be drawn to grant us rights but deny the same to them. After all, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a context where we are talking about becoming SIs, etc, the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a human and, say, a dog, is negligable.
</em><br>
<p>I agree this kind of issues is very important to us, and we need to
<br>
think through them carefully.
<br>
<p>The fact that there is no clear biological dividing line between us and
<br>
animals has been used by Singer et al to argue that hence there is no
<br>
clear ethical dividing line. This does not follow - it presupposes that
<br>
ethical dividing lines must be based on biological dividing lines. In
<br>
fact, if one looks carefully at this kind of argument the problem
<br>
appears that since there is no clear dividing line between animals and
<br>
plants, plants should also be regarded as belong to our ethical
<br>
category. 
<br>
<p>I think Dawkins is right: the important thing isn't belonging to a
<br>
certain species, but other inherent properties.  When I use the word
<br>
human, I usually refer to a being endowed with certain abilities such as
<br>
capacity for rational thought, freedom of action, the ability to change
<br>
behavior depending on learning, deductions and information received from
<br>
other beings and so on. Currently the only example we know of fulfilling
<br>
these properties are members of homo sapiens, and hence the usage isn't
<br>
erroneous, but we are aware of the possibility of encountering or
<br>
creating other beings with the same properties. Hence these aliens,
<br>
uplifted animals or AIs would also be &quot;human&quot; (at this point it would
<br>
make much sense to create alternative terms). A lot of philosophy and
<br>
humanism can be placed into this more generalized human framework with
<br>
little or no change. 
<br>
<p>Many of the human properties brought up by Singer et al as examples of
<br>
that we are not unique - language, use of tools, deduction etc, which
<br>
are found elsewhere in the animal kingdom - are actually not significant
<br>
from an ethical point of view. Sure, we wouldn't manage without language
<br>
or tools, but having them doesn't give us any special ethical status. On
<br>
the other hand, being able to largely change the way we act and live
<br>
depending on ethical ideas, that is a very significant property with
<br>
ethical implications. The list above of properties are essential for
<br>
being an ethical subject: an irrational being cannot act ethically, nor
<br>
can a being that cannot break its behavior patterns or learn. While
<br>
there are other species than homo sapiens that show these properties in
<br>
part, there is a significant difference in ability between humans and
<br>
even the brightest apes. Graded rights make sense, both within the human
<br>
category and outside it - as Per Svensson pointed out, acknowledging
<br>
humans as having a special ethical position that animals lack doesn't
<br>
imply that animals should be treated arbitrarily; you can be a humanist
<br>
without being cruel. 
<br>
<p>I would sum up by saying that from the perspective of an SI, the
<br>
difference between a man and a dog is not negligble. A dog cannot change
<br>
itself very far, while humans are in a sense a general form of being
<br>
that can at least aspire to vastly different behaviors and lives. When
<br>
it comes to being autotelic, the human has more in common with the SI
<br>
than the dog.
