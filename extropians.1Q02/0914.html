'I've said it before, I'll say it again:
<br>
Can a dog collapse a state vector?
<br>
Dogs don't use state vectors.
<br>
I myself didn't collapse a state vector
<br>
until I was 20 years old.'
<br>
- Christopher A. Fuchs (2001)
<br>
<p>Heh. It's not so simple, dr. Fuchs, and you know this very well.
<br>
<p>Einstein, at the Solvay Conference of 1927, talking about the
<br>
electron wave packet, the diffraction, and the resulting
<br>
registration on a screen, said: 'If |psi|^2 were simply
<br>
considered as the probability for a particle to be at a place
<br>
at that definite instant, it might happen that one and the same
<br>
elementary process would cause an action at two or more places
<br>
on the screen.' [A. Einstein, in &quot;Electrons et Photons - Rapports
<br>
et Discussions du Cinquieme Conseil de Physique Tenu a Bruxelles
<br>
du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927&quot;, Institut International de Physique
<br>
Solvay, Gauthier-Villars, Paris,1928, pages 253-256].
<br>
<p>At that time Bohr has already developed his 'complementarity'
<br>
principle (Sept. 16, 1927, 'The Quantum Postulate and the
<br>
Recent Develpoment of Atomic Theory', in 'Atti del Congresso
<br>
Internazionale dei Fisici' (at Como), Zanichelli, 1928).
<br>
Actually this principle states that if one analyzes any
<br>
situations where it is possible to know, fully, the path
<br>
the particle took, the interference pattern cannot be observed.
<br>
Likewise if one observes the interference pattern, no information
<br>
about path is available.
<br>
<p>Heisenberg (and perhaps also Bohr) thought that the 'general'
<br>
complementarity principle and his 'special' uncertainty
<br>
principle had something to do with the concept of 'information'.
<br>
And now we know they have something to do with the '_finiteness_'
<br>
of available information.
<br>
<p>Against Einstein's objection, Heisenberg and Dirac and Pauli
<br>
emphasized that the 'wave function' did not represent a course
<br>
of events in space and time, but it did rather express just our
<br>
'knowledge' of the events. Einstein did not agree. He developed
<br>
new objections. In example he represented a photon by a 'wave
<br>
packet' built up out of _Maxwell_ waves, with some extension and
<br>
frequency. By means of a semi-transparent mirror it is possible
<br>
to decompose that packet in a reflected one and in a transmitted
<br>
one. These two packets, after a little time, are well separated.
<br>
Thus the probability = 1 of finding the photon in a region implies
<br>
the probability = 0 of finding the photon in the other space-like
<br>
separated region. Thus the famous 'spooky' action at-a-distance,
<br>
'spukhafte Fernwirkungen', had his birth well before 1935 (the
<br>
EPR argument). Einstein wrote about this issue also in &quot;Louis de
<br>
Broglie, Physicien et Penseur&quot;, A. George (ed.), Albin-Michel,
<br>
Paris, 1953, page 9. The argument, polished a bit, now is called
<br>
the 'de Broglie paradox' (Louis de Broglie, J. Phys. Radium, (1959),
<br>
20, 963).
<br>
<p>But that is not the end of my story. It's interesting to note
<br>
that Heisenberg (but not Bohr) believed that the 'collapse' of
<br>
the 'wave packet' (thus also those 'spooky' actions) was _indeed_
<br>
a physical action, triggered by the 'indivisibility' of the particle
<br>
(The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory, Un. Chicago P.,
<br>
page 39). Was he right ? It seems so.
<br>
<p>Raymond Chiao and Paul Kwiat (among the very best in the field)
<br>
performed experiments with a couple of entangled photons (PDC
<br>
generated). One member of the pair (the idler) is sent to a filter
<br>
and to a photomultipier. The other member (the signal) is sent to
<br>
an interferometer (Michelson type). Now, in order to conserve
<br>
total energy and to fullfill the uncertainty (time, energy) relations,
<br>
they find that the visibility of the signal photon fringes depends
<br>
on the bandwith of the filter through which just the idler photon
<br>
goes. Thus the width of the collapsing signal photon wave packet
<br>
depends on that (remote, and well separated) filter.
<br>
<p>That's not completely new, because others experiments (about the
<br>
ghost effect, about Popper's suggestion, etc.) already showed
<br>
that the 'collapse' of a (splitted) 'wave packet' (just one
<br>
particle, or two particles entangled in a singlet state) follows
<br>
the non-separability rule. That is to say: quantum correlations
<br>
at a distance are real, nonlocal, instantaneous. But also uncaused
<br>
(thus special relativity is safe).
