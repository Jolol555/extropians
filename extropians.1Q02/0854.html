James noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It's only pocket change of course, but this project might just put a fire 
<br>
under some of the other EU nations who would also have suitable 
<br>
conditions.  After all, can't have the Irish owning the largest offshore 
<br>
wind facility in the world, now can we? :)  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My only contention is that people see energy technology for what it 
<br>
is-politically neutral. The purpose is to generate enough electricity to 
<br>
sustain the public's appliances, and for schools, factories, and government 
<br>
buildings.  Because &quot;green&quot; Luddites love coastal wind power is no reason to 
<br>
cheer it on or curse it.  My sense of this is that in the UK and Ireland, an 
<br>
economic-technical, public discourse becomes the cannon fodder for the left, 
<br>
and their syncompantic journalists.  It wasn't so long ago that nuclear 
<br>
energy was the darling of the 'greens' (read left).
<br>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but on my late night drive home from work I often listen 
<br>
to the 'piped-in' BBC on our so-called NPR affiliated radio stations. Thus, I 
<br>
hear the UK version of how the world is. I also see (despite centuries of 
<br>
animosity) how the Beeb seems to influence Ireland and Irish politics and 
<br>
world-views. I have come to see the Beeb as an anagram for Boorish 
<br>
Brainwashing Conspiracy.  ò¿ó   The BBC is great, though, for sound effects, 
<br>
such as pumping 'wah-tah' in some 3rd world ditch, or some harridan, sloshing 
<br>
French wine around her gullet.
<br>
<p>Back to the original post by James. Technology is inherently neutral,  
<br>
because we can use solar power to run gulags as well as nursery schools. Rant 
<br>
complete.
