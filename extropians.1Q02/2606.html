<p>The reason you would be motivated to set the value of your time
<br>
at its actual value is that setting it high costs you more.  You would
<br>
save money if you set the value of your time lower.
<br>
<p>The system would need radio signals from the cars.  It would need
<br>
to calculate the cumulative value of the time of those sitting at the red
<br>
light, compared to the value of those with the green.  The system
<br>
would only respond to those cars which can identify themselves to
<br>
the traffic light, for the persons who save time are those who will be
<br>
billed according to their own declaration of the value of their time.
<br>
<p>The system would maximize its own profits by calculating how to
<br>
save time for the self-proclaimed most valuable persons, then
<br>
sending each a bill in accordance with that self-proclaimed value.
<br>
If someone does not pay their bill, they might be waiting longer
<br>
at the traffic light.  There need not be any law that requires one
<br>
to pay one's traffic light bill, but the system would eventually ignore
<br>
the non-payer, or treat the non-payer the same as a car with no
<br>
self identifier, whose time value would be set to minimum wage,
<br>
for instance.
<br>
<p>Consider an intersection where there are three east-westers whose
<br>
value is set at 10 dollars an hour.  A yahoo is coming north to
<br>
south, late to pick up junior at daycare, which is charging him a
<br>
dollar a minute he is late.  It pays the system to make the three
<br>
10-per-hours wait for the single 60 per hour.  If the light turns
<br>
to save Daycare Dad one minute, he gets a bill for one dollar,
<br>
and its a breakeven for him, whereas the system lost only 50 cents
<br>
by holding up the three minimum-wage-proles, for a profit to
<br>
the system of half a buck, which goes to reduce the taxes for
<br>
all.  Such a deal!
<br>
<p>I need to write up a spreadsheet demonstrating how this would
<br>
work.  I would welcome helpful suggestions.  spike
