<em>&gt; i've been smoking off and on since i was about fifteen (four years,

</em><br>
<p>Four years isn't that long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i don't have much faith in patches or gum;
</em><br>
<p>Nor should you. Where you need faith is in yourself: your own
<br>
determination to quit permanently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if nicotine is more addictive than heroin, like they tell us,
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then a gradual decrease will probably not work.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Just quit. Now and forever. Don't make lots of plans. Don't
<br>
overthink it. Just stop and don't start again. Stop being weak. It's
<br>
all mental.
<br>
<p>Smoking is incredibly stupid and irrational. Any time the urge to
<br>
smoke strikes you, remember your reasons for quitting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i trust william burroughs on this one. but i've quit cold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turkey at least two or three times, and i've always started up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again. the best solution i can think of is to not leave utah;
</em><br>
<p>The best solution is to simply stop smoking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; since you can't buy cloves here and i really don't want to smoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regular cigarettes ever again.
</em><br>
<p>Cloves schmoves. Just quit smoking *anything*, fer Pete's sake.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; just finish the two and a half packs i have left, make some big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ceremony out of my last cigarette, and be done with it.
</em><br>
<p>Once you've decided to quit, deciding to finish your remaining supply
<br>
is a display of weakness. Destroy it, don't smoke it. And forget the
<br>
ceremony: that's just glorifying a very bad habit: one you want to
<br>
forget, not make memorable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; however, it's highly likely that i will be leaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this state; and every time i've started smoking again has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because i've gone to minneapolis (my dad lives there), where one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get cloves, and started again.
</em><br>
<p>Don't blame your own weakness on the availability of cloves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if no one here has ever touched cigarettes, than this is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wrong place to be asking, but i doubt that,
</em><br>
<p>Right, I quit after more than 15 years of pack-a-day smoking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and i'm not a part of any other community that is so concerned with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health. so, does anyone have any sort of helpful advice or meme's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for quitting and STAYING quit?
</em><br>
<p>How to Quit Smoking:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Don't smoke another cigarette, ever.
<br>
<p>It's that simple. No, it's not easy, but it's not that hard either.
<br>
The first day will be the hardest, but each day it gets easier. Try
<br>
not to substitute eating or drinking for smoking: as always, you
<br>
should eat right, exercise, and drink in moderation. Reward yourself
<br>
by buying a book, going to a movie, or spending your savings on your
<br>
favorite hobby or a membership at a fitness club.
<br>
<p>Be strong.
<br>
<p>-Dave
