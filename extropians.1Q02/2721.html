<p>This is an interesting idea. Certainly plenty of people get into highly
<br>
strung states when their innate drives conflict with learned morals. I'm
<br>
less certain if the big mental illnessess fit this picture. Maybe
<br>
post-traumatic stress disorder is due to a &quot;parasitic&quot; memory that
<br>
causes extreme arousal whenever it is re-activated, which helps it to
<br>
get re-encoded and associated with other things. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe everything with a kind of boundary just wants to be free. Well, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, many subprocesses *are* kinda free and bottom-up anarchic, with
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes. This kind of self-organising hierarchy needs some emergent
<br>
regulation to keep it suitably balanced between overly plastic or overly
<br>
rigid states, especially when it comes to learning. If this balance gets
<br>
upset, then all sorts of problems could result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Relevant to this broad suggestion, perhaps, is the very good article by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prof. Susan Greenfield in a recent NEW SCIENTIST (02 February 2002 issue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `Sensational minds') where she argues interestingly for consciousness as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linked to sheer number of neural components activated in concert; I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the article with me, and it isn't downloadable yet from their site,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but she proposes interactions between cognitive structures, affective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modules and the immune system. Depressive illness are linked to activation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns that exclude or downplay sensory inputs from body and world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenic and bipolar disorders are those where too much unselected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise drowns out cognitive control. Something like that, in brute summary.
</em><br>
<p>It could well be that many of the major mental illnesses are functional
<br>
illnesses; rather than having a clear physical origin they consist of a
<br>
maladaptive state of our dynamical systems. Of course, genetics,
<br>
experience and physical lesions can bring them about or facilitate them,
<br>
but in the end they could be due to &quot;being in the wrong attractor&quot; and
<br>
having the normally adaptive responses cause a vicious circle. Getting
<br>
out of such functional states could require some interesting
<br>
combinations of mental and chemical signals.
