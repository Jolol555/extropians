<p><p>Input and output results are all you need to duplicate ANY finite state

very similar to neural networks, not like the more conventional algorithms

that most people who work with software are familiar with.  With &quot;weight

states&quot; and everything.  These are programs/algorithms in every sense of the
<br>
word; just because you aren't used to seeing algorithms expressed in
<br>
something approximating an efficient Kolmogorov form doesn't mean that the
<br>
structure isn't an algorithm.  I *am* used to looking at algorithms that
<br>
have been reversed engineered into these forms, and while very different,
<br>
proper analysis can be learned.  (Weighted fuzzy networks are an efficient
<br>
approximation when insufficient memory nodes are available for a lossless
<br>
copy.)

capabilities.
