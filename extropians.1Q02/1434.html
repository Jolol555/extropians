</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, women make excellent precision shooters, and arguably seem to have more
<br>
natural ability in that area than men.  It is worth noting that there are
<br>
generally no gender classes in competitive precision shooting and that women
<br>
have no problem setting records and taking trophies in a sport that is
<br>
predominantly male by a wide margin.  However, while they might do quite
<br>
well in a sniper type role, they typically under perform in CQB type
<br>
environments, mostly for the reasons I mentioned in a previous post.
<br>
<p>Of course, the other theory as to why women seem to pick up target shooting
<br>
quicker than men is that women are more willing to be trained.  Many guys
<br>
have a hard time acknowledging the fact that they don't know what they are
<br>
doing and loathe asking for help.  Also, many guys act like there is some
<br>
expectation that they were born knowing how to shoot well and therefore tend
<br>
to be resistant to getting good instruction; few women have this ego
<br>
problem.  As someone who has trained numerous people on a variety of
<br>
firearms and shooting environments, this is completely consistent with my
<br>
experience.  Women do exactly what you tell them, but guys often try to do
<br>
things there own way or at least aren't as receptive to being corrected.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
