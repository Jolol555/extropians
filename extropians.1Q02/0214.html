<em>&gt; ... As I have asked many times here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't really been answered, what happens when there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market due to automation and continually more sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, for anyone with less than a certain amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general intelligence and a fair amount of training?
</em><br>
<p>I find it hard to believe that it's never been answered, but
<br>
perhaps it's never been answered to your satisfaction.  On the
<br>
optimistic assumtion that the latter is possible, I'll try:
<br>
<p>The most likely effect of continued automation is to move
<br>
the labor force into personal services and entertainment.
<br>
Just as the automation of agriculture totally changed the
<br>
American labor market from one where the majority of workers
<br>
were agricultural to one where only a small minority now are,
<br>
continued automation of manufacturing will change the face
<br>
of labor from manufacturing to services.  Whatever humans
<br>
can do usefully--make judgments, entertain other humans,
<br>
research and create--the market will expand demand for those
<br>
things, because the decreasing cost of manufactured goods,
<br>
at the same time it puts builders out of work, will also
<br>
increase the income available to the purchasers of those
<br>
manufactured goods to buy other things, like services and
<br>
artworks.  Human judgment will become valuable: for example,
<br>
the simple act of filtering and evaluating imformation will
<br>
become a valuable service.  More people will have personal
<br>
caterers and gardeners and secretaries.
<br>
<p>It's really quite simple: whenever a job is eliminated
<br>
because a machine can do it better, all of the people who
<br>
formerly paid for what that worker produced will now pay
<br>
less for what the machine produces, and will therefore
<br>
have more income to spend on other things.  And they /will/
<br>
find ways to spend it, and it /will/ end up employing
<br>
about the same amount of people.
<br>
<p>It doesn't even have to be as direct as that: when the
<br>
person who no longer buys the expensive hand-made good
<br>
buys the cheaper machine-made good and just stashes the
<br>
extra money in a bank account, the bank is enabled to
<br>
lend more for new business ventures to hire more people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... It is also not clear to me that having a &quot;job&quot; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best and only reasonable way that citizens may be productive or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they have access to a reasonable level of comfort and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom to pursue their happiness.  The &quot;job&quot; paradigm may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly obsolete as may be some old economic models based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in more scarcity and less high technology.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly the things people do as their &quot;job&quot; will change over
<br>
time and may become things we wouldn't recognize as &quot;jobs&quot; today.
<br>
But the basic facts can't change much: human beings are not born
<br>
self-sufficient.  We have to acquire food, water, etc., from our
<br>
environment in order to sustain life.  As long as that is the case,
<br>
we'll have to have a system to create those things and allocate
<br>
them.  Currently, the best system we have is for some subset of
<br>
the people who are best suited to the task actually create those
<br>
things, and some of us offer our services to those people in
<br>
exchange for the things, and the rest of us offer whatever
<br>
services we can perform to whoever wants them to further
<br>
distribute those things.
<br>
<p>When we make ourselves into self-sustaining solar-powered
<br>
robots, then that might change.  But in the meantime, we have
<br>
a damned good system.
