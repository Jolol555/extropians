<em>&gt;It would be necessary to prove the existence of significant conceptual

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Keeping in mind that the original discussion was whether animals had 
<br>
rights, clearly you seem to have come down on the negative in that regard, 
<br>
assuming you mean by the above that only humans probably have such 
<br>
characteristics.  I would agree with that since I don't believe animals 
<br>
have rights any more than humans do and in any event animals do not have 
<br>
(at least the same degree of) conceptual processing that humans do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Rand's own irrationality was amply analyzed by Nathaniel Branden in an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;article he wrote.  I do not reduce the argument to those &quot;inanities&quot; -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are we to assume his analysis is bug and bias free and utterly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct?  Besides my argument does not hinge on Ayn Rand or her level of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom from irrationality.  You assume too much.
</em><br>
<p>Assume what you wish.  I thought his analysis was fairly good.  What I was 
<br>
referring to was
<br>
the assumption on your part and on most libs part that conceptual 
<br>
processing is the distinguishing characteristic of 
<br>
humans.  However,  recent posts seem to refer to rights being rooted in 
<br>
&quot;human nature&quot;  which does indeed include those other qualities you refer 
<br>
to as inanities.  Since those qualities are prerequisite to human life (as 
<br>
presently constituted) they obviously fall under the heading of 
<br>
&quot;rights&quot;;  if you are to argue for rights, those qualities must be included 
<br>
as &quot;rights&quot; - i.e., if  I have a right at all, it is a right to breathe, 
<br>
and eat.  It is you who seem to wish to limit the justification for rights 
<br>
to conceptual processing; I don't believe everyone does.  Do not assume 
<br>
that every time I make a reference to someone's concepts of rights that I 
<br>
am referring specifically to something you said.  If I am, I will try to be 
<br>
specific about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;your attempt to simplify my argument to that level is incorrect.  I still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have yet to hear anyone translate the human capacity for conceptual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;processing or any other human need into a need for a &quot;natural law&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Who the heck is talking about &quot;natural *law*&quot;.  I am talking about natural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*rights* deriving from the nature of the beings involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The argument for &quot;natural rights&quot; as I have heard it expressed is 
<br>
supposedly rooted in &quot;natural law&quot; (which is also an ambiguous concept, I 
<br>
suspect) - what else does it mean when one refers to &quot;human nature&quot; as the 
<br>
basis for &quot;natural rights&quot; - are we to assume that you do not believe that 
<br>
&quot;human nature&quot; is somehow &quot;natural&quot; or based on the physical universe?  The 
<br>
nature of all existents is based on &quot;natural law&quot; - or more correctly on 
<br>
the organization (if any) of the physical universe as we presently 
<br>
understand it (and possibly regardless of whether we understand it or 
<br>
not).  Any justification for &quot;natural rights&quot; must therefore be rooted in 
<br>
this IF such justification can be found - else the justification is even 
<br>
more mystical.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Codified physical law&quot; is hand-waving.  There is the physical universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which includes biology and evolution.  There are human concepts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same.  The map is not the territory.  A human concept is not a physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;law (in fact, &quot;physical law&quot; is a merely a human concept - and there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are scientists who are not so sure that there ARE &quot;physical laws&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;operative throughout the Universe).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you claiming that human beings hae no specific nature and that their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;nature does not lead to certain conditions being more optimal for their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;well being, particularly concerning their interaction with other people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;and instutions of same?  You have to claim this if you are going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;utterly dismiss the argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Physical laws are not the end and be all of what is real and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; important.  They are the basis of reality but do not utterly contain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; everything in reality, if you see what I mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Obviously I am not claiming anything of the sort - do not put words in my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mouth.  Of course humans have specific needs - what I am objecting to is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the unnecessary transformation of a need into a mystical concept of &quot;right&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is not obvious to date. Why switch from specific nature to specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needs?  They are not the same.  It is you that is asserting that rights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are a mystical concept.  It is not a given for the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nothing is a &quot;given&quot; for the discussion,. apparently, since you seem to 
<br>
enjoy recasting my words into your particular framework and then striking 
<br>
down the resulting &quot;straw man&quot;.  Switch from specific nature to specific 
<br>
needs?  What does that mean?  And when I assert that rights are a mystical 
<br>
concept, that is exactly what I mean to assert.  And I could care less 
<br>
whether you agree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I already answered that question.  And the second one by implication. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;is a principle of Objectivism that rights are objective, derivable from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;reality.  If so there is no multiplication of concepts beyond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;need.  What exactly would you base ethics on if not on some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;understanding of what is required for human beings to function 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;optiomally together?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You have not answered the question except with more hand-waving.  It may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be a principle of Objectivism, but they did not derive it logically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;either except with hand-waving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please clarify what would satisfy you as more than hand-waving in such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion.
</em><br>
<p>You state that rights are objective derived from reality.  Are you now 
<br>
claiming that reality is not related to &quot;natural law&quot; - above you stated 
<br>
that you were not talking about natural law, but about natural rights.  Now 
<br>
you talk about physical reality.  Which is it?  This is what I mean by 
<br>
hand-waving - the willingness to switch verbal context with no apparent 
<br>
rigor in order to score points without clarifying anything.
<br>
<p>I want someone (and Phil Osborn's post comes much closer than yours does) 
<br>
to explain how a &quot;right&quot; is conceptually and qualitatively more significant 
<br>
than either a basic human need (including freedom if you wish) or the 
<br>
practical result of an economic analysis that establishes that coercion is 
<br>
non-productive and thus contra-survival.  What more needs to be 
<br>
established?  Why invoke a concept that adds nothing to the discussion?  Is 
<br>
it merely short-hand?  Short-hand tends to end up being ambiguous in this 
<br>
sort of discussion and such concepts are easy to &quot;hijack&quot; and then load up 
<br>
with a lot of &quot;baggage&quot; - as liberals do when the grab the concept of 
<br>
&quot;rights&quot; and start about a &quot;right to this&quot; and a &quot;right to that&quot; and 
<br>
suddenly it's &quot;these rights must be provided by somebody other than the 
<br>
recipient&quot;.  All that starts with the mushy notion of &quot;rights&quot; in the first 
<br>
place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I am amused that some people few the notion of ethics as a given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;essential of the universe.  If something does not fit their &quot;ethics&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The need for ethics grows out of the interaction of sentient beings like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ourselves.  I don't know what &quot;given essential&quot; means to you.
</em><br>
<p>I am referring to the way some people relate everything to ethics.  The 
<br>
current discussion on whether technology has ethical implications is an 
<br>
example which I may discuss later.  The assumption is that unless a concept 
<br>
can be fitted into their private ethics, it is somehow suspect.  I think 
<br>
such people are far more concerned with their perceived moral stances 
<br>
vis-a-vis everyone else - in other words, they are engaging in &quot;flight 
<br>
response&quot; as I discussed earlier.  Their purpose is not to insure that 
<br>
everything they do is ethical, but rather to establish themselves as &quot;more 
<br>
ethical&quot; than everyone else.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, the need for principles of action - which are not moral 
<br>
absolutes but heuristics - does grow out our circumstances as social 
<br>
entities.  As I say below, if you wish to call these &quot;ethics&quot; to 
<br>
distinguish from &quot;other&quot; principles, feel free.  I see no need to do 
<br>
so.  There is only one real principle to consider and that is 
<br>
non-coercion.  Everything else is derivative.  I need no complicated code 
<br>
of ethics - I need only to remember not to coerce people without 
<br>
overwhelming need.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;they cannot comprehend why it exists.  To be precise, there is in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have no idea what you are talking about.
</em><br>
<p>No surprise there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;no need for ethics at all.  What is needed is a set of principles by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;In fact&quot;?  What facts are these?
</em><br>
<p>See the above response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;which one can act in a social context and which provide the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;likelihood of satisfying one's survival needs.  If you wish to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is what ethics are, including how one arrives at and validates such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;these principles &quot;ethics&quot;, feel free.  I call them principles, so as not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to expand concepts beyond need and in the bargain burden a concept with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mystical baggage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Principles include many different things including those principles which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are part of ethics.  Therefore the word &quot;principles&quot; is inadequate as it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not uniquely bound to this area of concern.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Principles on the other hand can be enumerated.  Ethics is a term that can 
<br>
be hijacked by anyone because it is rarely enumerated.  People can say, 
<br>
&quot;This is ethical&quot;, &quot;That is not ethical&quot; and derive advantage without being 
<br>
required to specify WHY based on actual economic analysis.  Look at the 
<br>
current argument over cloning and related bio-tech.  Constant statements 
<br>
that cloning is not &quot;ethical&quot;.  This is used to conceal ulterior 
<br>
motivations.  It is never stated clearly WHAT aspects of cloning are not 
<br>
ethical and why - is it cloning humans before the technology is perfected 
<br>
to reduce the incidence of abnormal births?  Is it cloning humans for 
<br>
&quot;insufficient&quot; reasons such as replacing a dead child?  The term &quot;ethical&quot; 
<br>
is used for carpet-bombing - not rational argument.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a way of arriving at much the same thing.  You seem to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;quibbling more over semantics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Not at all.  One concept is based on mysticism (&quot;rights&quot;), one on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;demonstrable economic analysis of the behavior of large groups of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people.  One concept is based on &quot;natural law&quot; - a meaningless concept - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and one is based on practical results - productivity or non-productivity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;toward a specific purpose - survival of the individual and the species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These are empty assertions of &quot;mysticism&quot; and &quot;natural law&quot; that I did not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make.  You did.
</em><br>
<p>Others have made them before me.  I am criticizing them.  The distinction 
<br>
should be apparent to you but apparently is not.  I refer you to Robert 
<br>
Anton Wilson's book on natural rights again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- samantha
</em><br>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find the time to study Phil Osborn's 
<br>
post on this subject which is considerably more rationally stated than yours.
