<em>&gt; &gt;It should also be noted that virtually all of the concentrations of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;crime in the US occur in locales where firearms have been banned or severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;restricted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again this is just an argument from correlation. Is there any

</em><br>
<p>It isn't hard to come by. The FBI publishes crime data on every
<br>
jurisdiction in the US every year, which you can access via it's
<br>
website. John Lott's research was based on this data, the first study of
<br>
its kind (anti- gunners generally prefer to cherry pick a few counties
<br>
here and there that fit their preconceptions). He found that:
<br>
<p>a) making it easier for law abiding private citizens to carry concealed
<br>
weapons results in an average of 8% drops in violent crime (this number
<br>
was later increased to 12% by a study of the same data with more
<br>
accurate statistical methods by an independent group of researchers).
<br>
b) doing the above reduces the incidence of multiple shootings by 80%
<br>
c) for every 1% increase in CCW permit issuance, violent crime drops by
<br>
2%.
<br>
<p>His findings were published in his book &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; by the
<br>
University of Chicago Press. Professor Lott sat on the Olin Chair of
<br>
Economics at the U of Chi School of Economics at the time, and is now on
<br>
the faculty of Yale University. (

<p>The independent study I spoke of can be found here:

<br>
and Landes:
