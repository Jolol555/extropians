Again IMHO the idea of 'purpose' is wholly human and nonsensical, as is the
<br>
idea of 'why', we could remove the idea (and word) 'why from the language
<br>
and it would not be missed much, it would be replaced by things like 'what
<br>
causes'.
<br>
<p>Mommy why did that little bird die?
<br>
The bird died because it flew into the window and smashed its head.
<br>
Yes but whyyyyyy did it die??
<br>
because it needs a healthy brain to be alive and its brain was broken.
<br>
No mommy.. whyyyyy did it have to die.. it was a pretty bird!!
<br>
Life stops when too much damage occurs.
<br>
(I know I'd be a bad father yea yea)
<br>
<p>Do you think it would be helpful if the mom said 'its gods will, it was its
<br>
time, its the will of Allah, its part of a divine plan, it gives meaning to
<br>
life, it was a bad bird, so that other birds may live, it was unlucky,
<br>
everything dies, it is the way of the Tao, just because'?

Subject: Re: The Quest for the Purpose of Life
<br>
<p><p>: &gt; &gt;The primary purpose of life is to survive.  The secondary purpose
<br>
: &gt; &gt;is to evolve (or become extinct).
<br>
: &gt;
<br>
: &gt; The second sentence requires a pre-Darwinian metaphysics: evolution *per
<br>
: &gt; se* as teleological. If it *were* so, then punctuated equilibrium (say)
<br>
: &gt; would not be an observed fact of biological history. Every species would
<br>
: &gt; have its mutation checkers and repair systems turned down to the very
<br>
: &gt; lowest set point compatible with individuals surviving barely long
<br>
enough
<br>
: &gt; to reproduce and aid offspring (if that is beneficial). Indeed, we'd
<br>
: &gt; probably find copious programming designed to modify the genome as
<br>
greatly
<br>
: &gt; as possible in each generation. I don't think that's a good description
<br>
of
<br>
: &gt; current life on earth, even if some bacteria approach it.
<br>
:
<br>
: What makes you think that every species doesn't maximize it's rate of
<br>
: mutation?  Evolution predicts that there should be an equilibrium between
<br>
: mutation rate ensuring maximum variation for potential evolution and
<br>
: mutation prevention ensuring adequate health of the population.
<br>
Mutatation
<br>
: rate is itself an evolved trait.
