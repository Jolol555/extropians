<em>&gt;&gt; (LDC) ...purpose requires an entity capable of /desire/ and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; /free will/; such an entity must be able to form goals that support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; its desires, and can therefore choose its own purposes.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; (DB) A kidney gets built into a developing phenotype because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrangement of organized cells does a particular job acceptably well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a metabolizing entity. It obviously has a *function*, then; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be perverse to claim that it doesn't have a *purpose*.
</em><br>
<p>I can certainly imagine definitions of &quot;purpose&quot; that would apply to
<br>
entities such as a kidney, but then I can also imagine definitions of
<br>
&quot;function&quot; that wouldn't apply to them.  I think part of the basic
<br>
idea of &quot;purpose&quot;, at least as I understand the word, implies a
<br>
conscious telos, not merely the post-hoc appearance of one.  Besides,
<br>
there are genuine differences between purposefully designed things
<br>
and evolved things; evolved things, for example, do not have neatly
<br>
organized and compartmented functions. Sure kidneys remove waste
<br>
from blood, but so do livers, and both do other things as well. Name
<br>
any chemical in the human body and it is likely to have hundreds of
<br>
side effects on different systems.  Things designed by people don't
<br>
work like that; cars don't have a single circulatory system of hoses
<br>
that distributes a mix of fuel, lubricants, coolants, and chemicals
<br>
that do miscellaneous (and overlapping) functions: they have fuel
<br>
lines, and hydraulic lines, and coolant lines.  Paley was wrong--
<br>
you /can/ tell the difference between a watch and an eye, and know
<br>
which had a watchmaker.
<br>
<p>In that context, it might be meaningful to say that, for example,
<br>
ethylene glycol has the &quot;purpose&quot; of anti-freeze, because it really
<br>
doesn't do much else, and it was consciously included specifically
<br>
for that purpose by engineers (those engineers filling in the willful
<br>
entity argument of the &quot;purpose&quot; predicate). But it makes less sense
<br>
to speak of a kidney--or life in general--as having a purpose in that
<br>
sense, because it appeared gradually with multiple intermixed functions
<br>
that do not follow any intentional design.  They may appear to have
<br>
some rudimentary design-like features, but upon closer inspection one
<br>
can still tell evolved things from truly purposefully designed things;
<br>
we are definitely the former.
