<p>Agreed - what's the point of criticizing fiction as if it were 
<br>
reality?  Just to get the goat of lib Star Trek fans?

<p><em>&gt;This leads me to

<p><p>The problem I have with that notion and the referenced story (which I have 
<br>
NOT read) is that here again people seem to fix on a few technological 
<br>
innovations, slot them into an otherwise contrived environment and ask 
<br>
&quot;what if?&quot;  The problem is that a tech like nano is going to have very 
<br>
general, very pervasive effects very quickly; the same is likely to be true 
<br>
of &quot;true&quot; AI, vastly extended lifespan, and other major advances.  The 
<br>
likelihood of there being any kind of &quot;communist&quot; OR capitalist society 
<br>
after the Singularity is IMO nil. Charles Ostman talks about the &quot;virtual 
<br>
commodity asset economy&quot; which personally I expect to be the 
<br>
build-anything-you-want-when-you-want-it-and-dismantle-it-when-you're-done 
<br>
economy. IMO fully developed nano-based entities only need five 
<br>
things:  1)  Energy. 2) Raw materials (everywhere in the solar system). 3) 
<br>
Nano-mass. 4)Knowledge Bases. 5) Computation power.  What else do you 
<br>
need?  The only likely form of &quot;trade&quot; would be knowledge - facts and 
<br>
algorithms - and *possibly* entertainment.  The point of economics is to 
<br>
satisfy the survival needs of sentient biological entities on this 
<br>
planet.  Given that posthumans are unlikely to be biological (in the 
<br>
conventional sense) or have any survival needs they can't take care of with 
<br>
their tech, what's the point of trade in such a &quot;society&quot;?  In fact, IMO, I 
<br>
don't think these entities will have a &quot;society&quot; per se - I think they will 
<br>
be post-social, post-economic, and post-political as well as post-biological.
