<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;While I am steadfastly opposed to the drug war, and support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;legalized/medicalized drug use, I am also distinctly aware, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;extensive personal experience, that an individual addicted to drugs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is not a sane, mature, consenting citizen in control of themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(no matter whether the drug is alcohol, pot, coke, etc, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tobacco).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In this respect, civil forfeiture functions (admittedly poorly) as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;means of treating those who act like children as children. I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deny that it could be improved, in the form of making such seizures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;temporary, until the individual has gone through rehab and recovery,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rather than just a get rich quick scheme for policemen and police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;departments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you're advocating here is that any Means is OK, as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *you* find the Ends *acceptable*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drug-use is a victimless crime. The State has no business being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved with what one does with their own person and property as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as they don't physically harm the person or property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not find your Means acceptable. Once you tell the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's OK to throw someone in jail or take their property because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some behavior that is not harming anyone else, but that you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unacceptable, then what comes next? Firing them, evicting them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denying them credit, stripping away their civil rights, and the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes on without end. If a person chooses to diminish their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by using some drugs, then they have every right to do so.
</em><br>
<p>They have every right to do so, ONLY if the only negative impact is upon
<br>
their lives alone. If there are dependents involved, who have their own
<br>
rights to be free of such irresponsibility, or even just creditors, who
<br>
have a right to expect their money to be treated responsibly, then the
<br>
individual engaging in such behavior is putting jeopardy on others, not
<br>
just themselves, and in a libertarian perspective, the interests of
<br>
others put in jeopardy are equally as important as that of the drug
<br>
user.
<br>
<p>Are you advocating that an addict has a greater right to get high and
<br>
drive their kids off a cliff than their kids have to continue living?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each makes his/her own decision as to whether to expose themself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that drug, and one measures the potential good/harm against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own personal form of measure. &quot;Inform yourself, then choose&quot;. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best way to remove the largest dangers regarding drug use is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education .. not throwing that person into jail !!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drug use is just one of a long list of victimless crimes, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State has no business sticking their stinking noses into. I wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if anyone here finds any similarities in the rhetoric between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'War on Drugs' and the 'War on Terrorism' ?
</em><br>
<p>Note that I did not once advocate throwing drug users in jail, did I?
<br>
Nor did I say that an individual shouldn't be free to drug themselves as
<br>
they see fit, or even suicide. I am fully in support of the individuals
<br>
right to choose such activities, SO LONG as those activities do not harm
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>HOWEVER: From my experience in working with drug addicts, and my
<br>
understanding of the physiology of addiction, it is my opinion that a
<br>
person who becomes addicted to a drug is no longer fully in posession
<br>
their ability to freely make choices or decisions. At some point, it is
<br>
no longer the person making the decisions, the drug is (or rather, how
<br>
the drug has warped their minds physiologically and psychologically).
<br>
Drug addicts commit acts that they know are wrong, that they claim they
<br>
don't want to do, but are compelled to do so in order to get high again.
<br>
<p>Such individuals are no longer freely acting adult citizens.
<br>
Furthermore, their acts in pursuit of the next high generally involve
<br>
causing harm or damage or death to other people and their property:
<br>
children and spouses, business associates, creditors, neighbors, etc..
<br>
<p>For this reason, the claims that drug use is a 'victimless crime' is not
<br>
as black and white, slam dunk as many legalization proponents would like
<br>
to claim. Having been in the trenches of dealing with addicts, the
<br>
damage they do ALWAYS extends beyond themselves as individuals, as is to
<br>
be expected when an individual abdicates responsibility for themselves
<br>
to an inanimate substance.
<br>
<p>Nor did I say that civil forfeiture worked particularly well at what its
<br>
intended purpose is. It actually works rather badly, doing more to
<br>
enrich police departments and their officers than helping the real
<br>
victims of drug addiction.
<br>
<p>Nor do I consider all drug users to be addicts, which you seem to be
<br>
assuming.
<br>
<p>Now, I expect to see a rather hostile and unthinking, inconsiderate
<br>
condemnation from others here, such as Curt Adams, et al regarding my
<br>
comments. Before shooting from the hip with comments that reflect a lack
<br>
of actual comprehension about what I actually wrote here, I suggest
<br>
those whose ire is raised to read my comments again.
