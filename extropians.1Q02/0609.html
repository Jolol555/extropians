Off topic: Actually the incorrect quote associations are probably more a fault 
<br>
of my ineptness at this sort of thing, rather than poor listbot 
<br>
programming. . .I am still not quite sure if I am doing this right, so if 
<br>
somone could possibly email me the method *they* use to post and reply, it 
<br>
would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Although I like this idea, I have a feeling that in practice it might be a bit 
<br>
more complex. Firstly, what exactly would these &quot;time slices&quot; consist of? 
<br>
Downloading of a person into a cyborgian-type creature to roam around the 
<br>
physical plane? Or would your time &quot;alive&quot;  be spent roaming around information 
<br>
nets? Either way requires resources, (obviously for the cyborg, and 
<br>
power/computational cycles for the info net) and both are susceptable to ill-
<br>
tempered people when time is up. I think that, in order for somone to go 
<br>
willingly back in to suspended animation(which is what Im assuming is what 
<br>
happens between time slots) this would require extremly strong logic, 
<br>
willpower, and willing self-sacrifice in order for a person to not cause any 
<br>
problems when thier time was up. If force was used to bring people back into 
<br>
suspended animation, Im sure it could be argued this is a form of murder (since 
<br>
the stubborn people most likely wouldent be let back into the world very soon)
