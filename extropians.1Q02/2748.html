<p>
There are a few words that Ryo didn't get, and it's a fairly literal translation... but better 
<br>
than nothing.
<br>
<p>(start)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The object which flew in super-high speed was caught by the image of the bad
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dream on world trade center ?? September 11, 2001 to collapse by the super-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;high-speed UFO ? 01.09.16 ? terrorism of the rice terrorism image. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It let me make it an article with the news because there was discovery that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it wasn't transmitted though it had resistance to take up this event which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;many victims were taken out to. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;?? sacrifice ? part ?? mercy ?? image ? ridge ??? aircraft ?? back ?? 
<br>
object
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;? black ? smoke ? ridge ?? the sky ?? a moment 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is at the back from the building, and has considerable size, and it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seems that the object is moved at a far faster speed than the aircraft at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the back of the oblique right. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it seems to be ? that it is slender, a missile, too, when it has a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;look, as for fire ??, it can't think of ?? missile at this moment, and a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fact isn't transmitted, either. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It has the possibility which is more than one object from seeing some lumps
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;when it tries to expand (However, even if it is a missile, it feels too
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fast.), too. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was one fear ? ?? which might be a possibly serious image ?. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is that this object isn't reflected by other images. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How should I interpret this? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;object is small, and it is the thing which passed through the neighborhood
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the camera. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the object moved at high speed is the supposition which is
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;intuitively easy to accept from the experience near here. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, how it is seen, it seems that an object appears from behind the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;building as for the image. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;object is huge, and it is splashing through the place to leave a building. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot but think like this if it is a fact to appear from behind the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;building. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the proof that it is proved is necessary. ?? then, ?? The second
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;image existed. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one could be found when the thing this object was reflected ? the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;second collision image introduced to the public abundantly ? was looked for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;? the ? second image ? ?. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An image catches an aircraft from the right, and it is moved and takes a
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;moment to collide No.2 to the ridge. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;An aircraft approaches with this image just before the building.&gt; ? a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(yellow mark) ? goes to the building, and it is understood that there is an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;object (a red mark) to stand on the way in the air when it flies. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;An object goes out from the sight because a camera is moved to the left
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;after this. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, that back, ??    Even the about size of the body almost approaches the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aircraft that the right is four times expansion of the object ? the object
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;which approaches it suddenly ? ? a (yellow mark) ? just before the building.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It collides with the building from there, and a body disappears completely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;into the building. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The object (a red mark) which appeared from the right end of the image
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;almost approaches with the body of 767 right after the building ? the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aircraft ? ? the distance ? while it is moved because it is 48m. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects are the characteristics that 4 times were common to the object of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the 1st image by 2-3 lump-shaped from the expansion image. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is composed of more than one object. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An object passes through the side which an explosion spreads out in No.2
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the ridge. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may seem to presume both timing and a movement direction the same object
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;from corresponding to the object of the first image. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was probably caught around the third frame and the fourth frame from the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;top by ???? of the first image. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of this object is very special. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It flies in super-high speed to wave in top and bottom. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep it by all the frame ?GIF animate cartoons 388KB a path all frames &lt;An
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;actual image ? is high speed beyond the double of the GIF animate cartoon.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;???????? ? right click, and see it. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made &quot;??&quot; in the first image, by the second image, this, with the &quot;You
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;must not be here.&quot; object 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made to believe a certain thing. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As for this, a difficult image might be introduced to the public. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the UFO which approaches a helicopter suddenly from the world
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trade center where it is caught in ? It is ?? from that image. ? July, 2000.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels agreement in the appearance event of this UFO and the terrorism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;event. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very near the appearance position of the UFO and the collision
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;position of the aircraft. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It thought suddenly, and a shock was received personally though the image of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the color edition of the &quot;UFO image that the helicopter&quot; that Mr./Ms. the
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;indication of ????? ?? was being analyzed is approached suddenly was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reviewed. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that film, in the ..... beginning, UFO, though it comes to the sight from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;behind WTC, ..... like around the place an airplane is thought to rush in
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;the case of the simultaneous American frequent occurrence terrorism of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other day. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a UFO approaches it suddenly after that, and ? is minded, and it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to give it a ? feeling, too. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It thinks certainly too much, ??????. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt a terrible thing because it was just recently that it was introduced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the public though nothing could be said because it didn't know this ?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;which film ?. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it tries to verify an image there, the position of the ?? UFO of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ridge (the one with the antenna) is a little on the black zone No.1. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a collision position to the ridge is very the top from this, it
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;passes behind the ridge No.1, and the position of the aircraft which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;collided No.2 to the ridge is the same as the altitude which a UFO was ?????
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;?? No.1. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation for the terrorism has been begun with the information that
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;the man presumed executive ? has gone to American pilot school since about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;July, 2000 being since this time. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as for the UFO which raised warning, it is ?? that it was being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;watched ? the world trade center from the day ?.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance and do not fear the thorns in the path,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they draw only corrupt blood.
