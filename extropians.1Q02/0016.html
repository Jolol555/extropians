</em><br>
<p>Agreed in principle ....
<br>
<p>Except that you're mistaking the US for the entire world.
<br>
<p>My guess is that, legal issues aside, the USA is the country most likely
<br>
to see an AI phase transition first -- by a matter of a few months.
<br>
<p>Other countries and transnational groupings have different legal systems
<br>
and different lobbying groups, and different customs. Compare, for example,
<br>
the approach to cloning and embryonic stem cell research in various parts
<br>
of the EU with the near-total ban instituted by the current US government,
<br>
and you'll see one area where -- if Ashcroft and GWB don't change their
<br>
mind -- the US is going to definitely end up on the trailing edge. Pretty
<br>
much the same goes for your cellular communications infrastructure, although
<br>
802.11a might change that. And so on.
<br>
<p>Probably our best hope for an AI phase transition is a lot of competing
<br>
jurisdictions that don't agree on extraterritoriality and where each of the
<br>
big issues is chewed over by a different bunch of legislators who come to
<br>
different conclusions. And our greatest fear should be that WIPO or some
<br>
related treaty organisation draws up a multilateral agreement that member
<br>
governments sign into law and that enforces common guidelines on everyone. 
<br>
Such treaties tend to be restrictive rather than permissive ...
