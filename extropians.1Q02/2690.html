<p>This is a very interesting set of questions. As a computational
<br>
neuroscientist, I think I can answer them for the brain (which after all
<br>
is an existence proof of a hardware implemented AI). In the brain
<br>
routing does not seem to be very common - there are some ideas how you
<br>
could do it, but most signals are simply sent along firmwired paths
<br>
where adaptation (i.e. learning) changes where they lead on longer
<br>
timescales than the signals are themselves moving. This seems to be a
<br>
brute force solution: it grows many more axons and synapses than are
<br>
needed, and then the unnecessary are pruned or ignored.
<br>
<p>Now, if I was to implement this system on a parallel computer
<br>
instead, routing immediately becomes more relevant. If I store different
<br>
parts of the network on different nodes, then routing signals
<br>
efficiently can affect my performance a lot. The tricky part is that the
<br>
brain seem to be very modular on some levels (lobe interconnections,
<br>
cortical minicolumns) and highly connected on others (intercortical
<br>
connections, inside minicolumns), making division rather hard. 
<br>
<p>The general AI problem doesn't seem to me to be inherently about
<br>
routing, but any implementation beyond a dedicated hardware solution
<br>
subjected to scarce computing resources would likely have to deal with
<br>
routing to a very high degree. It would mainly be getting data to and
<br>
from processors, or accessing remote data/states. Clever routing would
<br>
improve the speed but not the smarts, and if cleverness can only help a
<br>
factor of 2 then brute force would be the way to go.
