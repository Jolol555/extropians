<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; resources remains the same--the amount of solar energy the planet

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not so.  The effective amount of wealth does not remain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say that, and I never would.  Please don't misquote me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand the difference between natural resources and &quot;wealth&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But my statement stands: the former /is/ finite and limited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our disagreement, if there is one, is that I believe that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitation will become a /more/ significant factor limiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth as we advance, and you seem to contend that it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become less of a factor, and that more of our wealth will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informational and such.  Your scenario is quite possible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't discount it out of hand, but I can't share it. No matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much wealth we create over and above natural resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone with more natural resources can still create more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone with less.
</em><br>
<p>Except for raw matter and energy, what but information and
<br>
technology to use the information would be of benefit after
<br>
deployment of full MNT?   How would having other &quot;natural
<br>
resources&quot; be of great advantage.  I honestly don't see how.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That it is not literally infinite is rather beside the point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is certainly not be any stretch &quot;scarcity&quot; of the kind our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economic system was designed to cope with unless we create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artificial scarcity by insisting the commons stays artificially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; small and everything imaginable has a price tag slapped on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have actually heard some go so far as to claim that every atom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of matter and erg of energy must be owned by someone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, I'm one of those.  Owned things get put to effective use;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things in the commons are inevitably destroyed and neglected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't it bother you that it is literally impossible to impose
<br>
ownership on every erg of energy?  Do you not understand the
<br>
values of commons to innovation?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because it's harder for humans to visualize the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; between 1 and 2 billion than to visualize the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1 and 2 hundred doesn't mean the difference doesn't exist.  As I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; said before, when everyone on the planet is a billionaire, the guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with 10 billion still gets the girl, the bigger spaceship, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; asteroid in the better neighborhood, and the nicer toys.  &quot;Scarcity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is a relative thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would hope that we grow out of this kind of adolescent rivalry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fairly soon.  But I won't hold my breath.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Competition is life. There is no higher purpose, or nobler pursuit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is only when competition deteriorates into predation and violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is a problem, and I would certainly hope that we grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of /that/.  But as for competition in general, if there weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a thing, I can't imagine wanting to live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Life is whatever we decide to make of it from here on out.
