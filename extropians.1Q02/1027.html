<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't see the relevance to my point, which was that those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;bleat about `evil' communistic/socialistic `free' education for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;all never seem to worry about `virtuous'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rich-parent-pays-&amp;-kid-gets-in-`free' education.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In my not-so-long-ago educational past the actual case was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most parents of all economic strata paid for their children's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually this has never been the case since public schools came
<br>
into being. Married couples get tax breaks and most pay a fraction
<br>
of what their childrens education costs.
<br>
<p>It is left to single people like myself to pay the bills.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I was one of the few poor saps whose parents weren't paying for my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, which kind of works against you since the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;operates under the assumption that your parents will be paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since most do.  
</em><br>
<p><p>As I've already pointed out this is not the case.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I don't see where the system needs to be fixed, beyond changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things a bit so people whose parents aren't paying for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education don't get hosed.  As far as I can tell, the only people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who really lose out under the current system are people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neither have someone to pay for their education nor qualify for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one of the myriad of special exceptions and aid programs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basically ignore otherwise ordinary non-minority folk such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;myself.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>The people who lose out are people like myself who are financing
<br>
(unwillingly) other peoples kids educations. 
<br>
<p>We want that changed, let the people who choose to have kids pay
<br>
most of the real costs.
