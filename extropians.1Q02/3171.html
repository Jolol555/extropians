<em>&gt; &gt; My point in a nutsell: friendliness cannot be imposed on one's superior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Genes tried it, and made a good run of it for quite a while.  Increasing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence made our genes ever more successful than the competitors of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; species.  But, as our genes found out, too much of a good thing is a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing.  We now pursue gene-imposed subgoals (sex, for instance) while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bypassing completely the supergoals (i.e., kids) at our whim.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It may be reassuring (or not) to realize that the means by which we resist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution is itself evolved, only on a deeper level.  We are imperfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deceptive social organisms who compete by arguing about each other's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motives;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is, we are political organisms.  We have adaptations for arguing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality; that is, in addition to our built-in evolutionary morality, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have dynamics for choosing new moralities.  In the ancestral environment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was, I suspect, a relatively small effect, amounting to a choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationalizations.  However, any seed AI theorist can tell you that what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matters in the long run isn't how a system starts out, it's how the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So of course, our dynamics for choosing new moralities are starting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dominate over our evolutionary moralities, due to a change in cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions:  Specifically, due to:  (1) an unancestrally large cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge base (stored-up arguments about morality); (2) an unancestrally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reflective model of our own mentality (timebinding historical records of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personalities, and (more recently) evolutionary psychology); (3) an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unancestral technological ability to decouple cognitive supergoals that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionary subgoals from their evolutionary rationales (i.e. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contraception).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3) in particular is interesting because the way in which it came about is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that evolution &quot;instructed&quot; us to do certain things without &quot;telling us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We won against evolution because evolution failed to treat us as equals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take us into its confidence (he said, anthropomorphizing the blind actions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an unintelligent process with no predictive foresight).
</em><br>
<p>Your posts are conceptually dense (it may not sound like it, but that *is* a 
<br>
compliment).  Kind of like the Bible, you see something new almost everytime 
<br>
you read it.  I'm still digesting (re-reading) some of your posts.  Don't 
<br>
know if I'll respond, but I do want to see what you're seeing.  Enough 
<br>
preamble.  To my question:
<br>
<p>Suppose evolution had somehow come clean with us and said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey humans, here's the deal.  You are genetically programmed to maximize 
<br>
the probability of the survival of your geneset.  So all those things you 
<br>
think you like (like sex, food, clothing, and close relatives) and all those 
<br>
things you think you hate (like pain, hunger and loneliness) are merely 
<br>
subgoals hardwired into your essential make-up simply to attain the genetic 
<br>
supergoal (maximizing the probability of the survival of your geneset--or in 
<br>
other parlance being &quot;friendly&quot; to your genes).&quot;
<br>
<p>Do you think that nature's honesty would have persuaded us to continue being 
<br>
&quot;friendly&quot; to our genes?  Or do you think we would still be saying &quot;Screw 
<br>
the survival of my geneset, I'm in this for the maximum enjoyment of my own 
<br>
particular phenotype&quot;?
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
