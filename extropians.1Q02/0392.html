<p>
Happy new year, folks.
<br>
<p>I just got back from a brief holiday. While the wet suits are drying, I
<br>
thought I'd check out the &gt;1000 extropian emails. I swore I'd go lurking
<br>
full time in Y2K+2. So much for that new year's resolution :). This whole
<br>
area of finance is very close to home for me and I am faced with this very
<br>
dilemma right now (as is Peter Voss). I think I have something to add to the
<br>
discussion: Specifically
<br>
<p>Observation #1 ___There's $$$ in *not* doing AI____
<br>
I have been cruising the WWW in the AI and neural area for so long and into
<br>
so many little corners my head spins. What I have noticed is that the human
<br>
brain (as opposed to mind), as source of incredible complexity, justifies
<br>
money to do apparently very rewarding and totally obscure projects .eg.
<br>
&quot;Quantitative analysis of a directed behavior in the medicinal leech&quot;.
<br>
<p>There is always the justification that something is learned with respect to
<br>
human pathology .ie. somehow we are better off knowing &lt;insert subject
<br>
matter&gt; because we can help people with &lt;insert condition/disease&gt;. When
<br>
human pathology is involved (eg cancer) $$$ seem to flow differently. Just
<br>
try and formulate an argument _NOT_ to do something to directly help human
<br>
health. Unpopular indeed.
<br>
<p>To me, it looks like there's a industrial scale business in decoding the
<br>
brain and if some aspect of 'mind' pops out, then it's a nice/interesting
<br>
accident but, so what?. From the point of view of AI I liken it to trying to
<br>
debug a word processor by looking at the silicon in the computer running it.
<br>
It's a long and apparently lucrative endeavor. You can write lots of papers,
<br>
publish books, go to workshops and lectures, actually be seen to do
<br>
something to apparently directly help humanity. Careers can be run along
<br>
these lines, and there's very few people to argue alternate courses of
<br>
action.
<br>
<p>Am I seeing something here, or am I imagining things?
<br>
I'd be interested in your thoughts.
<br>
<p>Observation #2 ___IMHO this is not a computer science problem____
<br>
I can relate to Mr Reason's gripe....big time.....:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if you're walking into a VC's office to pitch an AI company -- one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the few places you're guaranteed not to be the strangest project they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen -- they're going to want to hear how you're going to be generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue within six months from an initial investment. [Since you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software company, that is, and producing those easy-to-make software
</em><br>
things,
<br>
<em>&gt; as opposed to an infrastructure company making those hard-to-make lumps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iron, but I digress -- lambasting VCs is far too easy].
</em><br>
<p>....except in the tacit assumption that this is a software exercise. It
<br>
implies that all you have to do is pull a few comp sci folk in a room and
<br>
&quot;.....there shall spring forth a gazelle&quot;. This I liken to identifying a
<br>
group of carpenters with all their own tools and then saying to
<br>
them.....&quot;build a communications satellite&quot;. It'll end up made of wood and
<br>
the solution to all problems will be &quot;more carpenters!!!&quot;. Anyone who
<br>
believes this is a software exercise alone will, I believe, suffer the
<br>
consequences of project bloat and end up the slave of a self-serving monster
<br>
that will die, having eaten all of its food chain. {Can you tell I have run
<br>
a few software teams in my time :-) - It's called aversion therapy}.
<br>
<p>The comp-sci parts of this are a component of the the AI end-game. Go to
<br>
them with a detailed specification, get competitive quotes and hold them to
<br>
it! From that perspective it's probably a good thing that VCs want payback
<br>
so soon - it'll put limits on the length of the food chain from the start
<br>
and kill it appropriately early.
<br>
<p>Observation #3 ___A Camel is a Horse designed by a commitee____
<br>
The other side of this argument/observation is that AI becomes, by it's own
<br>
nature, a nebulous thing to sell to a VC. How do you convincingly sell an
<br>
endeavor that needs Neurophysiology, automation engineering, mathematics,
<br>
computer science, electrical/electronics engineering, psychology,
<br>
philosophy? Well IMO you can't. The VC has to share the vision - now there's
<br>
a challenge. A contradiciton in terms?
<br>
<p><p>observations done....
<br>
----------------------------------------
<br>
My ideal VC with truly prodigious gonads....
<br>
1) Hear me out on work to date.
<br>
2) Give me A$300,000 per year for 2 years. (defined goal, no promises)
<br>
3) Negotiate extensions after 1 year based on progress.
<br>
4) Let me get on with it (I will grudgingly agree to monthly reports on
<br>
progress)
<br>
:)
<br>
*dream on, Colin*
<br>
<p>In my own AI quest I have been unable to avoid Mr. Yudkowsky's &quot;life is what
<br>
happens while you are making
<br>
other plans&quot; syndrome. It's a reality that gets a bit tiresome when you have
<br>
to take your whole family along for the ride. It ...tests your resolve, to
<br>
put it mildly.
<br>
<p>What the hell. Just do it, I say! Life's too short.
<br>
(how about that, an extropian joke into the bargain)
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
Colin
