</em><br>
<p><p>Which is happening.  It would also help if someone could find a good
<br>
solution to the problem of warlords in general.
<br>
<p>The problem: almost nowhere in the world does the rule of law actually
<br>
apply fully.  Any major nation on Earth has those who would track its
<br>
faults (USA; the EU - or, if you prefer, each of its member nations;
<br>
Australia; Japan; Russia; China; et cetera), and most non-major nations
<br>
barely have even a pretense of laws.  It is in the latter that the
<br>
problem is most evident: a farmer's yearly harvest can be stolen in
<br>
seconds by thugs with guns, under the guise of &quot;taxation&quot;, &quot;fees&quot;, or
<br>
any of a number of other official excuses.  The farmer, of course, is
<br>
usually left with enough for himself to survive...else, who would plant
<br>
the fields next year?  The burden of taxation is also not always
<br>
consistent; some years, taxes - or just bad luck in the form of drought
<br>
or whatnot - are heavy enough to force the farmer to find work in the
<br>
cities.
<br>
<p>Violent force has been proposed to roust these thugs, but that suffers
<br>
from multiple problems.  First and most importantly, someone will rise
<br>
to power in the aftermath; what is to stop the new leader(s) from being
<br>
just as abusive, if not moreso?  (Continued force would lead to outright
<br>
invasion of the poorer countries, which leads back to post-Renaissance
<br>
colonialism - which has largely been overthrown as unacceptable, most
<br>
notoriously in a set of thirteen then-weak colonies which subsequently
<br>
became known as the United States of America.)  Second, force can not
<br>
always completely remove the old power structure - indeed, a number of
<br>
these countries are wracked by civil war between former, current, and/or
<br>
would-be governments.  There are more problems with this solution, but
<br>
these seem to be the largest.
<br>
<p>Market reform and capitalism have also been proposed, on the theory that
<br>
the naural laws of commerce will induce the oppressors to reform as they
<br>
see that, for instance, businesses prefer to invest where there are
<br>
stable (and enforced) laws, since this greatly reduces their potential
<br>
risk (risk-averse, relatively-low-reward businesses seem to be dominant,
<br>
though these all too often blind themselves to long-term risks in their
<br>
desire to minimise short-term risks).  While this has been used to
<br>
limited success, for instance with China, it relies on there being an
<br>
internal economy and a large enough labor force that business contacts
<br>
must go through more than a few people: bribing a few people is easy;
<br>
bribing each of an army of bearaucrats is expensive.
<br>
<p>So...what other solutions are there to this problem?
