<p>I believe its been fairly well documented that even a full
<br>
scale exchange would leave sufficient infrastructure standing
<br>
that it wouldn't extinct humanity.  In particular submarines
<br>
and all the technology they contain would likely survive.
<br>
<p>There would be a brief dip in the curve but I expect recovery
<br>
would take 50 years or less (witness the progress of the 20th
<br>
century -- say from 1900 to 1950).  It would happen faster since
<br>
recovery of a technological capability is probably more rapid
<br>
if you know that it is feasible beforehand.
<br>
<p>I've thought about the survivability issue quite a bit and I'm
<br>
more optimistic than I once was.  The threat from Gamma Ray
<br>
Bursts is much greater than NEOs or nuclear war (astro-ph/0110162).
<br>
Fortunately it looks like we may be safe from them through the
<br>
next century or so (unless there is an O or B class star nearby
<br>
we are unaware of).  So I think the singularity is a go.
