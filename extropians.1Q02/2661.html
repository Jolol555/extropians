<p>I probably wouldn't, but I would just remember that whenever I tried to post anything

about it here and get in another war that I can't win :)

<p><em>&gt;Chances are almost certain anyway that we're living in a simulation,

<p>*shrug* I have little to no opinion on the simulation issue; I think it would be really neat if 
<br>
we are, though. Though that did remind me of the similarities between the old-school 
<br>
hacker ethos and the magickian ethos! The laws of physics are no different from any 
<br>
other, and I will break them, too, if they are in my way :p
<br>

</em><br>

<p>Yeah. Although it occurs to me that, while we may be able to see how that works in 
<br>
theory and even in the equations that let it happen, until we do the expirement ourselves 
<br>
we have as little proof of any given amazing scientific thing as we do of any given 
<br>
amazing magickal thing. Or maybe that's just me; I can wrap my brains around these 
<br>
things in theory, but when faced with even something as simple as the speed of light my 
<br>
brain wants to explode (though I'm not sure if it can't figure out if it's absurd that there's an 
<br>
absolute limit to velocity, or of it's absurd that something can break that.
<br>
This is what comes, btw, from having a pseudo-new age mother and a geek father.
<br>
I always say how I'm not like my parents, until I look at myself from anything vaguely 
<br>
resembling an objective standpoint and realize that I'm just like them.
