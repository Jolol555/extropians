</em><br>
<p><p>And they are charged with what exactly?  With meeting someone

want to continue their chat about art or whatever.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Nor does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;follow that the cops can know what someone is loitering for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;necessarily. So just standing around is certainly not illegal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This also doesn't matter for Florida law.  Mere &quot;loitering&quot; is a crime even
</em><br>

<p><p>Many states have anti-lottering laws.  Hell, some states have

laws that say a woman is not allowed to appear in public with

less than 7 yards (iirc) of cloth covering her!  But that 
<br>
doesn't mean hardly anyone is in any great danger of being 
<br>
harassed on the basis of these laws.  They are a danger in that 
<br>
anyone can be harrassed with them whenever the authorities feel 
<br>
like it.  That is a huge danger and utterly alien to what this 
<br>
country is supposed to be about.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Florida!  There is even a law allowing the police to detain you on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;suspicion&quot; without ever having to specify suspicion of what.  It also is

are subject to such nonsense and worse whenever desired.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; possible to get arrested for resisting arrest with no other charges.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law doesn't have to make sense.  Cops routinely fall back to these charges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if other charges fail.  I have seen dismissed drunk-driving cases turn into
</em><br>

</em><br>

about losing your children, even while being expected to pay

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; have seen adoptions reversed when the man admitted have a homosexual affair.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have seen people kicked off school boards or barred from public office
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just for being gay.  Being gay, having gay sex, or hoping to have gay sex is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegal in Florida.  Breaking these laws has serious consequences and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routinely enforced on a small segment of the population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Hell, you don't have to be in Florida to be harrassed for being 
<br>
gay, lesbian, transgendered or in any other way &quot;queer&quot; to the 
<br>
local constables.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You seem to have a pretty strained concept of law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not some theoretical rant or my strange interpretation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statutes.  My partner and I routinely bail gays out of the local jail for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these ridiculous charges and help them get legal help.  I know this sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd in modern America, but welcome to my world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>You're right.  The law itself is &quot;strained&quot;.  I thought most of 
<br>
this wasn't so strong any more but then I live in/near the SF 
<br>
Bay &quot;gay ghetto&quot; and have for the last 26 years so what would I 
<br>
know?  Even here I have had enough lgbt friends hassled and 
<br>
physically assaulted by cops and citizens and various legal 
<br>
proceedings.  I have even had an acquantance beaten to death in 
<br>
the last decade just for being different.  So yes, I know it can 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and does happen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is illegal for me to cohabitate with my partner.  We could be hauled off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to jail and registered as sex offenders just for being a gay couple.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even have to prove sexual contact under Florida law.  We had to
</em><br>
<p><p>So, question, why stay in Florida?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; struggle to buy a house together because it is illegal for us to cohabitate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Florida.  We had problems getting insurance because of known illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity in the house.  My professional memberships, certifications and
</em><br>
<p><p>Heck, around here gays are known/expected to pay their bills 
<br>
better and probably fix up the neighborhood to boot. :)  Now, 
<br>
lesbians, we are another story. :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; government clearances have all been challenged because of my illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity.  It is a constant battle just to live where I live, live with whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I live, work in my chosen profession, and do business with the organizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do.  I am not making this stuff up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I have heard most clearances are not revoked as long as your are 
<br>
&quot;out&quot; so it can't be used to presure you.  Is that true?
<br>
<p>I know you aren't making it up.  It just seemed like you were 
<br>
painting the dark side too darkly for today.  But I think I was 
<br>
wrong in that opinion.  Thanks for the reminder, even if it is 
<br>
darn unpleasant to acknowledge.
