<p><em>&gt; Well, I'd have to contest some of this. lgbt

</em><br>
<p>Huh?  
<br>
<p>If same sex marriages are ever made legal, I doubt
<br>
you'd have to prove your homosexual orientation to get
<br>
a marriage license anymore than you now have to prove
<br>
heterosexual orientation to get an opposite sex
<br>
marriage license.  IOW, of course heterosexuals would
<br>
have the same &quot;right&quot; to marry same sex partners that
<br>
homosexuals now &quot;enjoy&quot; to marry opposite sex
<br>
partners.
<br>
<p>You must be making a point I am completely missing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conferring this right on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heteros still discriminates against sibling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parent/child,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aunt/uncle/neice/nephew/cousin couples, whereupon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you wind up legalizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sort of garbage that NAMBLA promulgates.
</em><br>
<p>I never did like &quot;slippery slope&quot; arguments too
<br>
much... and this one seems worse than most.
<br>
<p>Incest and statutory rape are two completely different
<br>
things, yet you seem to be equating them.
<br>
<p>BTW, isn't heterosexual statutory rape allowed in some
<br>
states as long as the parents of the minor involved
<br>
give their consent to the marriage?
<br>
<p>I just googled &quot;marriage age&quot;.  According to
<br>
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/Table_Marriage.htm">http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/Table_Marriage.htm</a>,
<br>
in Vermont the statutory rape of sixteen year old
<br>
girls is perfectly legal... as long as the parents of
<br>
the girl give their permission and the male and his
<br>
victim go through the meaningless rituals proscribed
<br>
by religious and/or secular authorities.
<br>
<p>It's even worse in Kansas... 12 year old girls are up
<br>
for grabs.
<br>
<p>Damn those queers at NAMBLA for wanting the same
<br>
rights with regards to the age of their sex partners
<br>
that heterosexual men enjoy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When it comes to marriage, it needs to be recognised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is very much a discriminatory institution,
</em><br>
<p>Why is it a discriminatory institution and even more
<br>
importantly why does that need to be recognized?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and discriminatory for a signficant purpose, 
</em><br>
<p>What purpose?  If you are talking about the conception
<br>
of children (anything else makes no sense at all) then
<br>
this (exi list) seems an odd place to put forth this
<br>
argument.  We routinely discuss technologies that make
<br>
a traditional heterosexual marriage superfluous to
<br>
conception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so use of 'equal protection' arguments by lgbt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couples/advocates is simply hypocritical.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;hypocritical&quot;? Even assuming some basis for your
<br>
primary assumption, I don't see that this particular
<br>
conclusion follows.
<br>
<p>Loree
<br>
<p>P.S.  I read in the Mike Mailway column yesterday &lt;
<br>
<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/mailway/article.asp?id=54180">http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/mailway/article.asp?id=54180</a>
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
that it is against the law to paint your house in
<br>
Vermont.  Is that true?
