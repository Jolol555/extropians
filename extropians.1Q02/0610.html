</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think you should be careful here. There is a fundamental
<br>
difference between the interned and the deaf, and that is that the
<br>
former very likely regarded their internment as something not having any
<br>
bearing on their identity (unless some of them got a really serious case
<br>
of Stockholm Syndrome), while the deaf - like many disabled people -
<br>
often include the property of being deaf into their self-image. So when
<br>
somebody suggests a cure it is not just an issue of getting better, but
<br>
to change one's identity. Such proposals need to be handled very
<br>
tactfully, and we transhumanists ought to remember the right to
<br>
morphological freedom is a *negative* right: we also have the right to
<br>
remain unchanged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This illustrates that cultures, in and of themselves, have no rights,

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but when it comes to valuing one's state it is hard to say that
<br>
somebody is simply wrong. 
<br>
<p>I agree that trying to prevent the use of cochlear implants or impede
<br>
their development in the name of a culture is wrong, but I don't see any
<br>
ethical right to impose them on unwilling subjects. The issue of young
<br>
children (which is really what this is about) is more tricky, since they
<br>
cannot truly give informed consent. Here I would apply my &quot;maximize
<br>
options principle&quot;: unless there is strong evidence that the implants
<br>
decrease their ability to participate in deaf or hearing culture, then
<br>
it is better to have more abilities and hence options, so the implant
<br>
would be a good. I still don't think this makes it obligatory or that it
<br>
would clearly overrule parental objections, but as a doctor I would take
<br>
my time arguing with the parents for getting the implant.
