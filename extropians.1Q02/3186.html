From: &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20SPACE:%20Cycler%20orbits">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a recent news article, someone made mention of a cycler orbit between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth and Mars.  The idea was to put a manned space station in such an
</em><br>
orbit
<br>
<em>&gt; so that it would &quot;cycle&quot; between encounters with Earth and Mars.  This
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; be a low cost way to ferry people, equipment, and supplies between
</em><br>
planets.
<br>
<em>&gt; The cycler orbit would need only a small amount of fuel for minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrections -- once the station was put into it.
</em><br>
<p>This idea seems great at first, but there are two downsides:
<br>
<p>1)  It wouldn't cut costs.  The energy needed to go half-way to mars and
<br>
then the rest of the way will be at least equal to the whole trip.  The
<br>
extra fuel needed to precicely dock with the cycler station will probably
<br>
make such a trip MORE expensive than a straight shot.
<br>
<p>2)  At a distance half-way to mars, the cycler would have an orbit of 517.6
<br>
days.  Doesn't sound bad.  But, as a result, it would line up with earth
<br>
only every 3.4 years, and with mars only every 2.1 years.  Assuming the
<br>
average (half) wait for any arbitrary launch time, a trip to mars via the
<br>
cycler would take 2.7 years.  Since mars aligns with earth every 2.1 years,
<br>
the cycler would slow down such trips.  And as I pointed out, without saving
<br>
any money.
<br>
<p><p><p>The reason such stations have been proposed in the past is not to save money
<br>
or energy, but to allow inadequate ships to get to mars.  Assume a ship
<br>
cannot carry enough food.  The advantage of a cycler would be that several
<br>
unmanned ships could be sent to rendevous with the cycler.  Then when the
<br>
manned ship goes, there will be an oasis with food along the journey.
<br>
That's the reason to consider cyclers.
