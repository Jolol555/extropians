<br>
<p>*Nano protein array could be just the tool for probing interactions on
<br>
biological scale. By using the technique known as dip-pen nanolithography,
<br>
chemists at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago have made
<br>
protein arrays with feature sizes ranging from 100 to 350 nm. The advance
<br>
could lead to protein or nucleic acid arrays--useful screening tools--that
<br>
are 1 million to 10 million times denser than those currently available.

<p>*New Understanding of Complex Virus Nano-Machine for Cell Puncturing and DNA
<br>
Delivery. Researchers have learned how the bacterial virus, bacteriophage
<br>
T4, attacks its host, the E. coli bacterium. This discovery could eventually
<br>
lead to a new class of antibiotics. (NSF 2/30/02)

<p>*Researchers at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) turn viruses into
<br>
enhanced nanochemical building blocks. Using a combination of chemistry and
<br>
molecular genetics, researchers at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and
<br>
The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology have found a way to attach a wide
<br>
range of molecules to the surface of a virus, essentially enhancing the
<br>
virus with the properties of those molecules. (2/1/02 Scripps)

<p>*'Nanocircles' act as Trojan horse to shut down disease-causing genes, study
<br>
finds. Stanford scientists have synthesized a molecule of DNA that is
<br>
capable of
<br>
shutting off specific genes in living bacteria. Dubbed the &quot;nanocircle,&quot; the
<br>
new nanometer-size molecule might one day give researchers the ability to
<br>
target harmful genes that cause cancer and other diseases in humans.

<p>*Glowing nanoparticles offer memory prospects. A US research team has
<br>
discovered a family of discrete-sized ultra-bright nanoparticles in the red,
<br>
green and blue range that could be useful for biomedical tagging, displays,
<br>
and flash memories. (EETimes 2/8/02)

<p>*New light on molecular switch that turns genes off. New research in yeast
<br>
cells may have pinpointed a key enzyme in the molecular circuitry that
<br>
silences genes. The new enzyme, Set2, could prove critical for helping
<br>
regulate gene expression in the ordered cycle of growth and division common
<br>
to all living
<br>
cells that have a nucleus. Thus, it may play an important role throughout
<br>
life, beginning with early development, in gene regulation. (2/14/02

<p>*Insulation breaks could pave way to nanoscale ICs. Scientists at HP Labs
<br>
and UCLA have patented a technique to construct ICs from a grid template
<br>
that could lead to a simple means of constructing circuits on the
<br>
nanoscale - 100 times smaller than circuits today. (2/31/02 EETimes)

<p>* In today's world, where a 3-pound laptop ranks as a pretty remarkable feat
<br>
of miniaturization, the concept of creating tiny robots to scour the ocean
<br>
for dangerous microorganisms may seem like the stuff of science fiction.
<br>
Over the next several years, however, a group of researchers at the
<br>
University of Southern California are hoping to bring that seemingly
<br>
farfetched vision closer to reality. (Wired 1/15/02)

<p>*Stimulated Emission By Three-Photon Excitation Seen. Researchers report in
<br>
today's issue of Nature the first observation of a phenomenon called
<br>
stimulated emission by direct three-photon excitation. The event occurs when
<br>
three photons of lower energy are simultaneously absorbed to reach a higher
<br>
energy state. The report comes from a team of researchers at the University
<br>
at Buffalo Institute for Lasers, Photonics and Biophotonics. (UniSci

<p>*Here's the ultimate PDA accessory: a $50 module that analyzes a sample of
<br>
your blood for anthrax and gives you the results on your Palm screen 10
<br>
minutes later. A Danish nanotechnology research spinoff called Cantion is
<br>
working on a technology it hopes will do exactly that. Other modules could
<br>
check your blood for everything from AIDS to cancer. (Wired 1/29/02)

<p>*Nanowire Superlattices. In this issue of Nano Letters and an upcoming issue
<br>
of Nature, three groups report exciting developments in the growth of
<br>
semiconductor nanowires with modulated structures. Semiconductor nanowires
<br>
are nanoscale building blocks that could through bottom-up assembly enable
<br>
diverse applications in nanoelectronics and photonics. (Download the PDF for

<p>*Adult Stem Cells Likely The Ones That Are Cloned. Do clones such as Dolly,
<br>
derived from adult cells, develop from fully mature adult cells or do they
<br>
develop from rare stem cells found in adult tissues? Researchers from Rudolf
<br>
Jaenisch's lab at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research have
<br>
proved for the first time that fully differentiated adult cells can form
<br>
clones. But they found the process is extremely inefficient. (UniSci

<p>*Nanotubes in the Fast Lane. Telescoping tubes. If you pull out a core from
<br>
a concentric set of carbon nanotubes and let go, the core should oscillate
<br>
in and out at gigahertz frequencies--faster than any other mechanical
<br>
oscillator. If engineers want to build nanoscale machines with moving parts
<br>
that can generate and respond to electronic signals, those parts have got to
<br>
be lightning fast. (Physical review Focus 1/18/02)

<p>&nbsp;*Our bodies' backup systems don't prevent aging, they make it more certain.
<br>
This is one offshoot of a new &quot;reliability theory of aging and longevity&quot; by
<br>
two researchers at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of
<br>
Chicago.The authors write, &quot;Reliability theory predicts that even those
<br>
systems that are entirely composed of non-aging elements (with a constant
<br>
failure rate) will nevertheless deteriorate (fail more often) with age, if
<br>
these systems are REDUNDANT in irreplaceable elements. Aging, therefore, is
<br>
a direct consequence of systems redundancy.&quot; (UniSci 2/12/02)
