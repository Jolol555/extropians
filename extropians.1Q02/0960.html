<em>&gt; This, again, is simply an assertion that there is no such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.  If you turn out to be wrong and there is no job at all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a significant part of the population, what then?  Should we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just allow them to die and hope that we never end up one of them?
</em><br>
<p>You seem to be laboring under a pathologically narrow definition
<br>
of &quot;job&quot;, which is a much more flexible concept than you give it
<br>
credit for.  Step back and take the larger view: resources as a
<br>
whole, i.e., food, water, housing, etc., cannot help but increase
<br>
as technology increases.  The rate of population growth decreases
<br>
with technology.  So the total available resources per person
<br>
will always be increasing (with a few short-term fluctuations
<br>
here and there caused by transaction costs and such).
<br>
<p>Those who need those things must (1) become producers, which
<br>
becomes easier as technology advances, (2) bargain with producers
<br>
for their goods, which likewise becomes easier because increasing
<br>
supply and decreasing demand drives prices down, (3) become
<br>
predators, stealing from the productive (such as becoming a
<br>
government).  Setting aside (3) for the moment, bargaining for
<br>
goods produced by others can only become easier as technology
<br>
advances, to the point where a &quot;job&quot; consisting of nothing but
<br>
taking goods off producer's hands might be enough to bargain
<br>
for them.  A person might have to do nothing more than fill
<br>
out a marketing survey for some company once a month to get
<br>
enough money to live comfortably for the month (of course, even
<br>
those who are fabulously wealthy by today's standards will
<br>
lament their abject poverty just as the so-called poor today
<br>
with running water and good food and safe housing and televisions
<br>
and cars do today).  A &quot;job&quot; is merely doing anything that
<br>
benefits some other person in some way, and may be as minimal
<br>
as providing an entertaining story (like the San Franisco
<br>
homeless man who tells jokes for $1), or as complex as building
<br>
construction; the level of labor each person performs will be
<br>
whatever gives him an adequate standard of living by his own
<br>
standards.
<br>
<p>Now, most people will have skillsand talents that allow them
<br>
a large enough share of the produced goods that they can afford
<br>
to give some away as well.  Some will do so for pure ego: to
<br>
control a family or a congregation, for example. Some will do
<br>
so as rationally self-interested charity, to reduce the amount
<br>
of predation in their neighborhood.  At any rate, it is
<br>
extremely and increasingly unlikely that anyone will actually
<br>
starve without there being /something/ he can offer for food
<br>
and shelter, even if it's nothing but a promise to stay
<br>
downwind.
