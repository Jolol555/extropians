<em>&gt;&gt; Oh, that's very hard to imagine!  Let's see...  Socrates!

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to tell you one thing, which is that Plato didn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tape-record the dialogues featuring Socrates, and that his dialogues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not really transcripts of such dialogues. I hope you are not too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappointed.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all and you revelation is not news to me -- and probably not news
<br>
to most people.  Even so, the fact that Plato used the dialogue form
<br>
seems to show the respect he gave for doing philosophy in real time.
<br>
<p>Also, we have other written evidence of Socrates, especially from
<br>
Xenophon, to compare Plato too.  It doesn't give us the full picture of
<br>
how Socrates differed from Plato, but it gives us good grounds for
<br>
seeing there was a difference.
<br>
<p>My point, however, was limited to showing you don't need writing to do
<br>
thinking -- whether that is philosophizing or whatever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Don't you think that the use of the dialogue form by Plato and later
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; philosophers is telling here?  I mean you don't need the written word
</em><br>
to do
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't need the written word to argue. But you need the written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word 1) to remember your results, and think about them further,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of forgetting them from one day to the next, or even from one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the discussion to a later part, and 2) to read the results of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<p>Number 2 above is trivial.  Obviously, you need writing to do reading!:)
<br>
<p>Number 1, however, is not exactly true.  The written word does make
<br>
remembering and comparing results much easier, but it's not absolutely
<br>
necessary.  People can and do remember their &quot;results.&quot;  Without the
<br>
written word, it's not like everyone falls into utter total confusion.
<br>
I mean, did you remember your name or how to tie your shoes because you
<br>
wrote them down?
<br>
<p>There also seems to be some evidence that preliterate people are better
<br>
at recalling lot of details.  (If this is true, my guess would be that
<br>
most literate people forget stuff merely because they can easily rely on
<br>
writing for recollection.  So, they never develop a habit of non-written
<br>
memory -- or not to the same extent.  Perhaps there was some division of
<br>
labor here too -- with people who have better memories serving as living
<br>
books...)
<br>
<p>This is not to attack writing.  I think it's one of the greatest
<br>
inventions of all time.  I just don't reduce everything else to it.  I
<br>
think humans did and still do a lot thinking and remembering outside of
<br>
writing.
<br>
<p>It's also not to say that recalling stuff from memory is perfect or
<br>
better than writing it down.  Obviously, writing took off because it has
<br>
some advantages, and this is one of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't think seriously by responding publically to agressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarks. You think seriously by maturing problems over time (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by discussion), then making an effort of writing, formulation, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-reading it and reflecting about it, having other intelligent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read it, etc.
</em><br>
<p>My point: you don't absolutely need writing to do this.  It helps, but
<br>
one can consider problems over and over without writing them out.
<br>
Writing is so prevalent among us, that it seems inseparable, but think
<br>
of how many people make it through the day -- whether they philosophize
<br>
or try their hands at other problems, such as irrigating a field or
<br>
fixing a car engine -- without the need for writing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very. Remember that the human brain is unchanged since a very long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. The reason why it seems so different now is it is full of very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated cultural products; those rely on the written word to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop. Oral tradition can only go so far.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I don't deny this.  But as far as oral tradition can go, it can
<br>
carry along a lot of philosophizing.  Without a doubt, we postliterate
<br>
people can do a lot of things preliterate people cannot do, but, in this
<br>
case [of philosophy], I think it's more us [maybe] being able to do
<br>
things better than of use being able to do something preliterate peoples
<br>
could not do at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our brain was not designed to do philosophy (nor science) as you may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize. It was designed to be distracted, to react in real time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats, etc. We manage to think more refined thoughts with the aid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that intellectual augmentation called writing.
</em><br>
<p>I would argue that our brain was not designed at all.:)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, I don't think the evolutionary argument here helps you.  (Too
<br>
many times people on this list try to cloak their arguments with
<br>
evolutionary theory.  It's mostly unnecessary.)  I never denied that
<br>
writing is immensely helpful in philosophy and other endeavors (e.g.,
<br>
history), but it did not necessarily create them.  It's kind of like
<br>
eating and cooking.  People ate long before they discovered fire and
<br>
learned how to cook food.  Do I claim that cooking is totally
<br>
irrelevant?  No at all!  It certainly opens up whole worlds of food
<br>
experience not possible before.  Yet the fact still remains, we can eat
<br>
without cooking.  We can think without writing.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
