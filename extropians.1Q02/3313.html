</em><br>
<p><p>You don't have to get used to it, you've just chosen to locate yourself in
<br>
regions that have relatively dense populations.  Part of this is standard
<br>
market mechanisms at work.  Many of the most desirable places to live are
<br>
heavily populated, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Nonetheless,
<br>
there are VAST tracts of usable land that are essentially uninhabited, even
<br>
in countries that are nominally highly developed.  Quite frankly, in the
<br>
Western Hemisphere it seems that many undesirable places have huge
<br>
populations and many desirable places have less than a person per square
<br>
mile population density; there are many factors at play as to why people
<br>
concentrate where they do.
<br>
<p>I think a lot of the concern about overpopulation is based largely on
<br>
perception.  It isn't so much that we are over populated as it is that the
<br>
population is very poorly and/or unevenly distributed, due to a mixture of
<br>
historical, political, and economic reasons.  There are still large regions
<br>
of the United States where one can drive a hundred kilometers between
<br>
houses, never mind towns, particularly west of the Rocky Mountains in the
<br>
Lower 48 and in Alaska.  The same is true of most of Canada.  I have little
<br>
doubt that North America could easily and safely support 2 billion people
<br>
given the necessity and without utterly destroying the environment.  If you
<br>
lived in Southern California or the Bay Area (like I do) for example, the
<br>
world really does seem overpopulated, but the reality is that just east of
<br>
those very densely populated areas is a thousand miles of land where the
<br>
population density approaches zero.  I guess you could consider it a kind of
<br>
sample selection bias.
<br>
<p>As for me, I love wide open spaces without a trace of civilization.  And if
<br>
you've ever been to those places, it is fairly evident that there is
<br>
relatively little chance of them becoming overrun with civilization any time
<br>
soon.  Most people *like* living in dense urban/suburban environments.
