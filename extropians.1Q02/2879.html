<p>Odd. I've got three CPU chips from an old IBM mainframe (the whole CPU
<br>
was actually made up of I think 20 or 36 separate chips), each of which
<br>
had a cemented on heatsink. (I was thinking of bedding each in epoxy as
<br>
paperweights). You'd think that these guys would have improved things
<br>
since the old big blue days...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; across the chip face for the fan to draw air through should provide a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Copper and diamond heat spreaders should be there quite soon, and advent
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Latter is a must for computronium, of course.
</em><br>
<p>How quickly would the human brain cook if it didn't have liquid cooling?
<br>
<p>The problem with the chips using conventional heatsinks is that the
<br>
place where the most heat is produced, the center of the chip, is the
<br>
furthest from the area of highest heatsink airflow. Doing the following
<br>
port scheme would optimize airflow:
