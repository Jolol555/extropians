<p>
I was really encouraged by this story, particularly because I wasn't aware
<br>
of this subculture of &quot;biohackers&quot;. I've had a dream of installing an stm in
<br>
the garage for a while now :-)
<br>
<p>Actually, the main reason I was encouraged was because I'm about to embark
<br>
on a (second) BSc, in chemistry &amp; biology, shooting down the molecular
<br>
biology route. I've been reading some biology textbooks and its just so
<br>
fascinating, not only because the micro/nano world is so interesting and has
<br>
incredible potential, but because knowledge of it seems so coarse, even now.
<br>
I have a feeling its not going to stay that way for long, however.
<br>
<p>Just as a point of interest, the degree I'll be doing (still sorting out
<br>
enrollment details) will be by distance, part time, probably about 4 years
<br>
in total (because it's part time, mitigated by credit for my previous
<br>
study). It's really fascinating how subjects like molecular biology are
<br>
handled by distance. For some units, you need to turn up on campus for about
<br>
a week in a block to do all the lab work at once. For others, they actually
<br>
send you a kit so that you can do the lab work at home. Weird, ey?
<br>
<p>My plan is to go through the undergrad years of this thing, then work out
<br>
how to proceed from there into honours/grad dip/etc, and finally (hopefully)
<br>
a PhD. I particularly want to, in the later stages of study, combine my
<br>
computer science and maths background with the molecular biology, and
<br>
hopefully come up with something halfway useful :-)
<br>
<p>Enabling those later, postgrad years, in terms of income, is fairly dodgy
<br>
what with family and all, but hey, the horse might fly. Meanwhile, it's all
<br>
moot unless I can get through the undergrad component. 
<br>
<p>The educated reader will understand that my interest here is in the fields
<br>
which lead toward early stage nanotech. I figure that computer science +
<br>
molecular biology + chemistry is a pretty good basis to work from. Am I
<br>
missing anything important?
