<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yup, read it twice.  However, it's been quite a while since my last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; reading, before the movie came out.  My recollection (admittedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; flawed on occasion) is the book didn't deal with sexual integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; at all.  No shower scenes that I can remember.  Maybe I'm wrong, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think the fully integrated showers was a Paul Verhoeven creation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure the integrated shower scene was inspired by Joe Haldeman's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The Forever War&quot;, not &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, the book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Almost nothing in the ST movie was inspired by the Heinlein book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except the title, the character names, and a few points of the plot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides that, it was a complete hatchet job that Heinlein would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never had approved of if he had been alive.  This should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too surprizing, since its director (Paul Verhoeven) has repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown himself to be the very archetype of a hollywood &quot;player&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally without scruples.  I'm sure he promised Heinlein's heirs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he would be true to Heinlein's story while he was advising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his lawyers to make sure the contract would protect him from suit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when he didn't.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From the over the top propagandistic presentation of the movie, it seems
</em><br>
to me that Verhoeven is one of those in the &quot;Heinlein was a fascist&quot;
<br>
camp, though he claims that he was trying to capture the spirit of the
<br>
Battle of Britain and the newsreel footage typical of the WWII period
<br>
(and?).
<br>
<p>The sexual integration seems more reminiscent of Piers Anthony's &quot;Space
<br>
Tyrant&quot; series, though Haldeman does come to mind as well.
