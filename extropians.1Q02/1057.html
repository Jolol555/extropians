</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize that they will always be threatened by their own slaves, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically divide into two factions over this.  One faction favors (after
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically engineering the Master Race, and just as importantly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering of a slave race designed to be dominated and like it.  They
</em><br>

<em>&gt; It is an interesting depiction of essentially *choosing*, for non-rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideological reasons, the sort of society you want, and then going about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering people to fit that preconception.  I suppose the commies would
</em><br>

<p>&quot;Everysen a Chief, none Indians&quot;, as Damien says in &quot;The White Abacus&quot;.
<br>
<p>The underclasses should all be mindless robots, not human beings or
<br>
sentient ai. The problem with popular acceptance of this vision is that
<br>
too many people can't envision themselves as ever being a member of the
<br>
upper class, so they automatically assume that the intent is that they
<br>
be enslaved.
