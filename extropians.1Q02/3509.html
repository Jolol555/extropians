<em>&gt; &gt; Would it not be more extropian to encourage trade in human organs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I realise this sounds gruesome to many people, but it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definitely result in increased organ availability. It would be difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does it get us generally closer to the type of world we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish/need  to live in?  It doesn't look much like what my goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.  On the one hand it is ghastly unpleasant and subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tons of abuse.  On the other hand I wonder how much worse it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sell all of one's hopes, dreams, ambitions, talent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive time to merely eat and pay the rent while never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming one's own dreams.  Selling a kidney seems almost clean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in comparison. If a person can choose one questionable trade-off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely then why not the other?
</em><br>
<p>That is the whole point of capitalism- choice.  People are more likely to
<br>
choose
<br>
the higher payoff, but always some people will make choices most people see
<br>
as questionable.
<br>
the question is, does anyone have a right to prevent people from making bad
<br>
choices?
<br>
<p>(1) banning trade in organs violates your right to own your own body.
<br>
(2) legalizing organ trade would result in greater organ supply and thus
<br>
decreasing mortality rates for many diseases.
<br>
(3) families of dead people would be better off, especially people who now
<br>
cannot afford a
<br>
proper funeral.
<br>
(4) you could make extra cash by selling blood, skin, etc.
<br>
<p>The only disadvantage I can see is organ smuggling, which is rumoured to
<br>
occur currently.
<br>
An open market would probably incrrease supply to the point where such
<br>
gruesome possibilities would be uneconomic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Except in situations of unequal power and wealth the selfishness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the more powerful will, other things being equal, swam the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest of the weaker.  If people can be coerced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuaded to do and go along with some of the stupid things of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today then I find it very hard to believe that many could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuaded to part with an organ even if it was not, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably objective analysis, in their interests.  If that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so then granting such trade legal status would legalize a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nightmare with serious moral and health repurcussions.
</em><br>
<p>There are few organs which can be taken from live bodies, and enough people
<br>
die that market forces would result in demand satisfied by dead peoples
<br>
organs.
<br>
Maybe I have too much faith in peoples intelligence, but I really cannot see
<br>
someone
<br>
giving up, say, a healthy cornea, given that the number of dead people
<br>
leaving their
<br>
organs to their families to sell would drive prices down.
<br>
<p>I cant see a down side to legalizing organ trade.
<br>
Your concerns sound vaguely paranoid, but are unfortunately shared by most
<br>
people-
<br>
making it unlikely that organ trade will occur in the near future.
<br>
