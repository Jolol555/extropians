What do you see as the coverage of such a machine, in principle? 
<br>
What failure modes do you think it might have?
<br>
Would it have blind spots where it would say &quot;I don't know whether this thinking
<br>
is correct or not&quot;, or the like?
<br>
Would it evaluate the thinking of animals other than humans?
