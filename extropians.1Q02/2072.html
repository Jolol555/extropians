<p><em>&gt;I believed CR was about controlling carefully the insulin levels in your

</em><br>
<p>The mechanism is not yet known.  Yeast and nematode longevity mutations
<br>
have been linked to a pathway by which reduced insulin growth factor, or
<br>
reduced response to growth factor, increases transcriptional and replication
<br>
repression.

<p><em>&gt;Eating 'less' is not as useful as eating the 'right' things to achieve

</em><br>
<p>Eating less, and basically only that, produces the CR effect.  Lab animals 
<br>
get 
<br>
powerful CR effects from diets of sugar or fat, plus vitamins and minimal
<br>
protein.  Low-quality eating, however, can kill you, and your safety margin 
<br>
goes does as you eat less.  Abrupt onset of CR is linked to death from heart
<br>
trouble.  I have also noticed that quality food is more satisfying than junk
<br>
food; I believe the body has hunger signals for nutrients besides calories.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I'm wrong, I'm going out for chips &amp; ice cream right now, so please let

<p><em>&gt;me know any evidence to the contrary!
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm disagreeing with some of your points,  but I'd still recommend
<br>
skipping the ice cream and chips!  Supplementation regimes have been
<br>
far less rigorously tested on humans than animals, for both ethical and 
<br>
practical
<br>
reasons (who wants to dozens 100 year cohort longevity studies ? (shudder))
<br>
So while rats do well on one serving of ice cream per day plus supplements,
<br>
I doubt humans would.
