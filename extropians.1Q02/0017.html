Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>Given the medium of this list, and the issues that we've
<br>
been discussing at depth during the last months, I post here
<br>
one of my favorite poems to start this new year.
<br>
<p>Happy 2002 !
<br>

<br>
<p><p><p>The Word   (by Pablo Neruda, from _Full Powers_, 1962)
<br>
<p><p>The word was born
<br>
in the blood,
<br>
it grew in the dark body, pulsing,
<br>
and took flight with the lips and mouth.
<br>
<p>Farther away and nearer,
<br>
still, still it came
<br>
from dead fathers and from wandering races,
<br>
from territories that had become stone,
<br>
that had tired of their poor tribes,
<br>
because when grief set out on the road
<br>
the people went and arrived
<br>
and united new land and water
<br>
to sow their word once again.
<br>
And that's why the inheritance is this:
<br>
this is the air that connects us
<br>
with the buried man and the dawn
<br>
of new beings that haven't yet arisen.
<br>
<p>Still the atmosphere trembles
<br>
with the first word
<br>
produced
<br>
with panic and groaning.
<br>
It emerged
<br>
from the darkness
<br>
and even now there is no thunder
<br>
that thunders with the iron sound
<br>
of that word,
<br>
the first
<br>
word uttered:
<br>
perhaps it was just a whisper, a raindrop,
<br>
but its cascade still falls and falls.
<br>
<p>Later on, meaning fills the word.
<br>
It stayed pregnant and was filled with lives,
<br>
everything was births and sounds:
<br>
affirmation, clarity, strength,
<br>
negation, destruction, death:
<br>
the name took on all the powers
<br>
and combined existence with essence
<br>
in its electric beauty.
<br>
<p>Human word, syllable, flank
<br>
of long light and hard silver,
<br>
hereditary goblet that receives
<br>
the communications of the blood:
<br>
it is here that silence was formed by
<br>
the whole of the human word
<br>
and not to speak is to die among beings:
<br>
language extends out to the hair,
<br>
the mouth speaks without moving the lips:
<br>
suddenly the eyes are words.
<br>
<p>I take the word and move
<br>
through it, as if it were
<br>
only a human form,
<br>
its lines delight me and I sail
<br>
in each resonance of language:
<br>
I utter and I am
<br>
and across the boundary of words,
<br>
without speaking, I approach silence.
<br>
<p>I drink to the word, raising
<br>
a word or crystalline cup,
<br>
in it I drink
<br>
the wine of language
<br>
or unfathomable water,
<br>
maternal source of all words,
<br>
and cup and water and wine
<br>
give rise to my song
<br>
because the name is origin
<br>
and green life: it is blood,
<br>
the blood that expresses its substance,
<br>
and thus its unrolling is prepared:
<br>
words give crystal to the crystal,
<br>
blood to the blood,
<br>
and give life to life.
