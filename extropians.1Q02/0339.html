New Books About Robotics
<br>
<p>The Robot Revolution
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/269359/ref%3Db%5Fh%5F%5Fbrbx%5">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/269359/ref%3Db%5Fh%5F%5Fbrbx%5</a>

<br>
Robots are making other robots. They've quietly learned how to reproduce.
<br>
Now they are numerous enough to change forever the way we live and work.
<br>
In a factory on the slopes of Mount Fuji, industrial robots are now making
<br>
more robots, working flawlessly around the clock with virtually no human
<br>
supervision. In Beverly Hills, a robot that normally serves drinks at
<br>
parties is arrested for handing out business cards illegally in a busy
<br>
downtown street. From forbidding lunar landscapes to mineral-rich ocean
<br>
floors, robots perform tasks we thought only humans could do—or could not
<br>
be done at all.
<br>
In &quot;The Robot Revolution&quot;, noted author and computer engineer Tom Logsdon
<br>
reveals the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction world of robots and the impact
<br>
they are having in all facets of society, from industry and defense to
<br>
sports and entertainment. He explores their history from the legendary
<br>
creations of the ancient Greeks to the experimental ultra sensitive
<br>
machines of today. And he explains just what a robot is and why the latest
<br>
advances in such fascinating fields as artificial intelligence are making
<br>
real robots more and more similar to R2D2 and C3P0. Ready or not, the
<br>
Robot Revolution is here and our lives are never going to be the same
<br>
again.

<p>Robotics, Mechatronics, Artificial Intelligence : Experimental
<br>
Circuit Blocks for Designers
<br>
<a href="http://www.softpro.com/0-7506-7389-3.html">http://www.softpro.com/0-7506-7389-3.html</a>
<br>
Accessible to all readers, including students of secondary school and amateur
<br>
technology enthusiasts, Robotics, Mechatronics, and Artificial Intelligence
<br>
simplifies the process of finding basic circuits to perform simple tasks, such
<br>
as how to control a DC or step motor, and provides instruction on creating
<br>
moving robotic parts, such as an &quot;eye&quot; or an &quot;ear.&quot; Though many companies
<br>
offer kits for project construction, most experimenters want to design and
<br>
build their own robots and other creatures specific to their needs and goals.
<br>
With this new book by Newton Braga, hobbyists and experimenters around the
<br>
world will be able to decide what skills they want to feature in a project and
<br>
then choose the right &quot;building blocks&quot; to create the ideal results.
<br>
In the past few years the technology of robotics, mechatronics, and artificial
<br>
intelligence has exploded, leaving many people with the desire but not the
<br>
means to build their own projects. The author’s fascination with and expertise
<br>
in the exciting field of robotics is demonstrated by the range of simple to
<br>
complex project blocks he provides, which are designed to benefit both novice
<br>
and experienced robotics enthusiasts. The common components and technology
<br>
featured in the project blocks are especially beneficial to readers who need
<br>
practical solutions that can be implemented easily by their own hands, without
<br>
incorporating expensive, complicated technology.

<br>
An introduction to the past, present, and future of artificial intelligence
<br>
and robotics, discussing early science fiction predictions, the dawn of AI,
<br>
and today's use of robots in factories and space exploration.

<p>Beyond Webcams : An Introduction to Online Robotics
<br>
<a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~goldberg/online-robots/">http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~goldberg/online-robots/</a>
<br>
This book summarizes the state of the art in Internet telerobots. It
<br>
documents eighteen projects with sufficient engineering detail to allow
<br>
readers to understand how these systems are designed, how they function,
<br>
and the engineering challenges they solve. It includes robots that
<br>
navigate undersea, drive on Mars, visit museums, float in blimps, handle
<br>
protein crystals, paint pictures, and hold human hands.

<p>Biorobotics
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/026273141X/107-8844243-2778932">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/026273141X/107-8844243-2778932</a>
<br>
Animal-like robots are playing an increasingly important role as a link
<br>
between the worlds of biology and engineering. The new, multidisciplinary
<br>
field of biorobotics provides tools for biologists studying animal
<br>
behavior and testbeds for the study and evaluation of biological
<br>
algorithms for potential engineering applications. Biorobots are now
<br>
enabling biologists to understand complex animal-environment
<br>
relationships. This book unites scientists from diverse disciplines who
<br>
are using biorobots to probe animal behavior and brain function.
<br>
An animal is profoundly affected by the many subtle and complex signals within
<br>
its environment, and because the animal invariably disturbs its environment,
<br>
it constantly creates a new set of stimuli. Biorobots are now enabling
<br>
biologists to understand these complex animal-environment relationships. This
<br>
book unites scientists from diverse disciplines who are using biorobots to
<br>
probe animal behavior and brain function. The first section describes the
<br>
sensory systems of biorobotic crickets, lobsters, and ants and the visual
<br>
system of flies. The second section discusses robots with cockroach motor
<br>
systems and the intriguing question of how the evolution of complex motor
<br>
abilities could lead to the development of cognitive functions. The final
<br>
section discusses higher brain function and neural modeling in mammalian and
<br>
humanoid robots.
<br>

<p>&quot;You'll learn to like robots.

They'll be nicer than human beings.&quot;
