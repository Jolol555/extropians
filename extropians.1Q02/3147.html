<p>Well, my first reaction to this was to laugh and say, &quot;I give up!&quot;  Some days
<br>
you just can't win...
<br>
<p>On reflection, though, I think that there are two dynamics here.  Anyone who
<br>
wants to think precisely will need to use precise terminology.  So if you're a
<br>
bad writer and you want to think precisely, you use complete neologisms -
<br>
arbitrary, hard to remember or identify once you're a few pages out of
<br>
context.  Good writing practice is to minimize this impact by adapting
<br>
existing terms where possible, and using recognizable word combinations where
<br>
a genuinely new term is needed.  So it's preferable - in terms of being able
<br>
to think clearly and reason clearly - to use neologisms rather than not have
<br>
any new words at all, but it's also preferable to use recognizable language
<br>
rather than pure neologisms.
