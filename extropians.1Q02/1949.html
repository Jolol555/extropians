<em>&gt; hmmmm. do you know exactly how they bugger up the longs faster? or any

resources
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i'm on ventolin (or albuterol, here in the states), btw.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Asthma's classified in various ways, but generally into allergic /
<br>
non-allergic categories. Younger people generally have the allergic kind.
<br>
Two different sorts of medication are given for this; beta agonists
<br>
(ventolin) and steroids. Beta2 agonists copy the effects of adrenaline and
<br>
noradrenaline (normally part of your 'fight or flight' response. Steroids
<br>
act on the underlying inflammation.
<br>
The allergic response that produces inflammation also produces phlegm.
<br>
Anything causing an allergic reaction, ie smoking, food additives, pet hair,
<br>
microbes, will increase the need for the use of both types of medication.
<br>
Smoking initially loosens phlegm and makes it easier to cough it all up, as
<br>
you've noticed. But in the long term it is exacerbating the problem and if
<br>
you give quitting a chance, you'll find you don't  need your ventolin so
<br>
much.
<br>
People who smoke often find they're using their inhaler more and more,
<br>
psychological addiction can occur (can I do without it??)
<br>
and it can get to the ridiculous extremes of taking a toke on the inhaler so
<br>
that you can have a cigarette without triggering an asthma attack! Tolerance
<br>
becomes a factor...basically mixing beta2 agoniser with any allergan or
<br>
irritant is a recipe for trashing your lungs, liver and kidneys.
<br>
Stay off the cigarettes and after a couple of months have a pulmonary
<br>
function evaluation. You might be pleasantly surprised to discover that your
<br>
medication can be reduced or changed to something a little more gentle
<br>
(especially if you're on steroids).
<br>
Lastly, Zyban has had quite a bad press lately because of adverse
<br>
effects -including 50 or so deaths which may be related to its side effects.
<br>
However, compared to the dangers of and deaths due to smoking, it is
<br>
definately the safer option! It works by modifying the two neurotransmitters
<br>
involved in nicotine addiction and withdrawal, so it's not just replacing
<br>
one form of nicotine with another.
<br>
Stick with it dude...every day is another step towards...towards...towards
<br>
freedom from feeling like shite because your lungs were full of stuff that
<br>
isn't meant to be there...
<br>
Incentive...if you're still off the cigarettes by the time I get married,
<br>
I'll send you a copy of my gut-bustingly hilarious publication &quot;The Cakdon
<br>
Book of Records&quot;. Remind me...I have a memory like a filter paper...but good
<br>
luck.
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Ramonsky
