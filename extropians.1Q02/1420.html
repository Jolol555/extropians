<em>&gt;Any connection with the Renaissance?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the ancient Greeks? It was tied up in their view of
<br>
health and beauty. And also &quot;dignity&quot; (going back to Anders'
<br>
discussion here last summer).
<br>
<p>from my post: &quot;Mind/Body dualism&quot;  Tue Aug 21 2001
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q01/4579.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q01/4579.html</a>
<br>
<p>(quoting myself)
<br>
For the first, I think that &quot;reverence&quot; might be a more suitable
<br>
word than &quot;fascination&quot;. The Greek's view of their bodies was
<br>
strongly coupled with their view of their natural world, in that
<br>
they saw beauty and harmony and felt it was their duty to preserve
<br>
it, and their place in it.
<br>
<p>For the Greeks, the human body was a masterpiece. They would make
<br>
sure to do everything humanly possible to promote its health and
<br>
therefore, its beauty. They would go to the gym (heh.. gymno in
<br>
Greek means naked..), exercising every day, bathing every day in
<br>
private or public baths, cover their skin with olive oil and herbs
<br>
to moisturize and scent it. You can follow some of their body-care
<br>
in the old stories. For example, in Homer's Odyssey, every time
<br>
Odysseus passed through, yet, another calamity and was in a place
<br>
where he could recover, the first thing that he would do before
<br>
feasting his face was to bathe and anoint himself with olive oil.
<br>
<p>The mind-body link to the Greeks was very strong. Health was
<br>
important if you wanted to be beautiful: in mind and in flesh. In
<br>
fact, the mind was considered to be a bit more important because the
<br>
beauty of mind was identified with virtues like justice and honesty,
<br>
for example.
<br>
<p>The Greeks took the mind-body link one step further to the arena of
<br>
&quot;action&quot;. The aesthetic of the body and the health that accrues from
<br>
physical fitness was a symbol and evidence for the reality that
<br>
every individual has the power to translate word into deed and to be
<br>
men and women of action, and not of just talk.
<br>
<p>[Did you know that the early Greeks preferred their athletics nude?
<br>
They invented the Olympic Games on this basis. ]
<br>

<br>
<p><p>The Ancient Greeks 'uncovered' most than other peoples, it
<br>
looks like, but not entirely.
