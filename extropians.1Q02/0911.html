<em>&gt; &gt; That would have to be way further than we see now. The initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pre-population II population(s) of stars and subsequent mixing of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interstellar medium only lasted n*10^7 years, according to current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modelling. That's pretty much an eyeblink -- you can safely assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; galactic and larger scale structures start out at pop II
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metallicities. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't see that pop II is too little metal for life and civilization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're the stellar modeler here. However, we're second or third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation?
</em><br>
<p>The whole concept of generation in the sense of parent and child stars is an
<br>
artifical one -- it's a constant ongoing process. Stars with lots of metals
<br>
are designated Population I, everything else we've seen is (probably)
<br>
Population II, and Population III is a hypothetical box in which to throw
<br>
hypothetical very-low metal stars. As I recall, there were one or two
<br>
candidates for the upper end of Population III in the solar neighbourhood
<br>
among the halo population of dwarf stars. In theory, small Pop III stars
<br>
could still be in their main sequence now -- yet more support for their mass
<br>
function being very high.
<br>
<p>(Just to make it more interesting, you have to have a couple of generations
<br>
of Population III at a couple million or tens of millions of years each to
<br>
get up to Population II metallicities).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not see how you could have had a noticeable population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of systems with the amount of small wet rocky worlds in the olden times.
</em><br>
<p>If you can get a solar system like ours on 2% metals, you can do it on 1% or
<br>
0.5%.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The material had to be passed through several times to enrich on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavier elements. Plus, young galaxies are too bright for life. Plus, life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs a lot of time to progres to level which is interesting. Unless we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme freaks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dunno, I think due to multiple factors delayed hatching is real.
</em><br>
<p>I think a more rigorous argument with some numbers is probably called for;
<br>
too bright for life sounds like the best bet, but bear in mind that you
<br>
could be sitting in the plane of an active galaxy and be shielded by dust
<br>
and gas from the core.
