<em>&gt;From all I had read, I think the post below best expresses my ideas with a qualifier:
</em><br>
<a href="http://www.network54.com/Hide/Forum/message?forumid=144401&amp;messageid=1012544191">http://www.network54.com/Hide/Forum/message?forumid=144401&amp;messageid=1012544191</a><br>
<p><p>I wish to state that I don't think anyone can live forever, and not even Type IV or above civilizations. One day, our universe will
<br>
end and with it us. Even if we travel to other universes, constantly hopping from one to another as each terminates, accidents can
<br>
happen that will stop our existence.
<br>
<p><p>This does not even come close to asking why we would like to survive just for the sake of surviving. Should we live just for the
<br>
sake of living (as some transhumanists seem to imply)? Should we exist just because a bunch of genes pulls some levels in our brains
<br>
and commands: &quot;Reproduce!&quot;
<br>
<p>Should we follow the convention of existing just because others had continually existed before us? Why do death and extinction sound
<br>
so bad if our genes, not our brains, does the answering of this question?&quot; Should we think of us as mechanical clogs in the machine
<br>
of life just following our preprogrammed genes to continue existing?
<br>
<p><p>Hitler would find it useful to say in court that he would only want to cleanse the human race of some lower life forms that ought
<br>
never to exist. If you have to play prosecutor, how would you rebut each of his assertions? If you play the judge, how do you arrive
<br>
at the decision of what to do with Hitler? If you have to play Hitler's defense attorney, what can you say in defense of him (other
<br>
than that he adopts a vegetarian lifestyle). Lastly, if you play Hitler, how do you verify the validity of your set of values in the
<br>
trial?
<br>
<p>How do we arrive at all these assertions if we have no idea why we exist?
<br>
<p><p>A number of us had probably not consider the possibility that Digital Physics and God can co-exist (with God as programmers outside
<br>
the simulation), though He/She/It/They would probably not have such egoistic desires that some others had believe (like requiring
<br>
absolute belief in Its existence or your entry into a computer simulation that will inflict pain on you for apparently forever).
<br>
<p>I wonder if reading about Zen will help or not. It seems to me like saying: &quot;Life has no purpose, but only suffering. However, you
<br>
should not crease to exist because you can help other beings realize this and reduce the amount of suffering.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, the Zen master would probably knock my head and say &quot;MU&quot; if I ask him/her about the meaning of life (or existence).

<p>Hope this helps.

<p><p>BTW, you can call me Eric Chen when referring to me. I know my middle name causes problems with non-Chinese speakers.
