<em>&gt; &gt; And it didn't actually take you to sites you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to go to (as he continually claimed but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually demonstrate).  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I humbly disagree.  
</em><br>
<p>Of course you do!  You wouldn't have posted the link
<br>
to that site if you didn't agree with it.  
<br>
<p>I've got to ask, however... have you actually seen
<br>
TopText at work?  If not, then you don't know what you
<br>
are talking about... read what I wrote again... if so
<br>
then you are being purposefully deceptive about how it
<br>
works.  I've described it accurately... your
<br>
description isn't accurate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A link is supposed to do what the HTML says to do.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If I put a link on my website to bring up my resume,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; that is what I want it to do.  
</em><br>
<p>But it's MY computer.  If *I* want your link to do
<br>
something other than what you intended, *I* most
<br>
certainly have that right, no?
<br>
<p>You are still claiming hijacking.  I wouldn't call it
<br>
that...  You use the term &quot;hijacking&quot; more for it's
<br>
emotional content that it's actual meaning.  Your
<br>
original code is still the same and still works the
<br>
way you intended... it hasn't been hijacked at all. I
<br>
could still go where you wanted me to... it's just now
<br>
I have additional choices as well.  I could choose to
<br>
make a different use of your page than you intended...
<br>
once you publish, you've given me the right to do
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Suppose rather than clicking your link, I use it as a
<br>
phrase in a search engine?  I do that kind of thing a
<br>
lot.  Do I have a right to do that?  Of course I do. 
<br>
TopText merely provides a (poorly implemented) short
<br>
cut to that function that operates all the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it brings up an ad for monster.com or lists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other resumes that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to look at instead 
</em><br>
<p>Not instead... in addition to... big difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of mine, I would call that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link hijacking.  
</em><br>
<p>As long as the target of your link is still a choice,
<br>
it hasn't been hijacked... additional choices have
<br>
been added.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Once I saw what TopText was, I didn't want it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I had no problem at all uninstalling it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I do NOT, however, think that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an inherently unethical program... just a useless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wasn't it unethical for it to install itself without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your knowledge?  
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstood... It didn't install itself without
<br>
my knowledge.  It was one of the components listed in
<br>
the set up screen.  I could have chosen not to install
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>It is unethical to mischaracterize something merely
<br>
because you don't like it.  TopText is a sucky program
<br>
that doesn't provide anything useful.... it is NOT a
<br>
virus, nor does it hijack links or direct children to
<br>
porn sites (I noticed you choose not to respond to
<br>
that part of my complaint with the &quot;Scumware&quot;
<br>
website!).  
<br>
<p>The Scumware website is garbage.  TopText is garbage. 
<br>
Neither is exptropian in any sense.  
<br>
<p>You are a security professional... at least that is
<br>
what is says in your sig.  I trusted you.  I went to
<br>
that website on your reccomendation...  My trust is
<br>
now less than before.
<br>
<p>Save the &quot;Security Alert&quot;s for actual security
<br>
hazards.  Using it this way merely dilutes your
<br>
credibility.
<br>
