Society's rights are fictional, but individuals's rights aren't?

<br>
Uh, how so?
<br>
Culture Minds are designed to be 'nice', but they don't seem to be
<br>
living in Hell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because emphasis of selfishness makes individuals more productive,

<p>Emphasis of selfishness by itself does not make them more productive.
<br>
Prisoner's Dilemma, anyone?  Bureaucratic corruption?  Enron?  
<br>
<p>The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is self-enforcing when the parties have
<br>
to stick around each other.  Without iteration -- like a large society,
<br>
with many hit-and-run interactions -- selfisness leads to mutual
<br>
defection leads to suckitude.  Instinctive niceness leads to better
<br>
results for all.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a point which I tried to make at Extro5 but I'm not sure how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many actually understood it: virtuous behavior is only virtuous when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is voluntary. Compulsory virtue is nothing but hell on earth.
</em><br>
<p>So parents compelled by evolution to love their children are in hell?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; question of the existence of natural rights. Rights exist as a result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature, not because some people choose to grant them.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What does it mean for the rights to exist, without people granting them?
<br>
How would a universe where rights didn't exist as a result of nature
<br>
differ from the one we live in?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do recognise that there is a difference between the existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights and their recognition by people. Objective truth always exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrespective of our ability to observe it and understand it.
</em><br>
<p>Objective physical truth can be demonstrated to those who don't believe
<br>
it.  Gravity pulls.  Bullets kill.  Light bends.  How can you
<br>
demonstrate the existence of the rights you believe in?  If you can't,
<br>
how can you claim they're objective?
<br>
<p>Western rights lead, under our circumstances, to more pleasant and
<br>
efficient societies.  Thus they spread.  The rights do not include an
<br>
untrammeled right to selfishness.  And under different circumstances,
<br>
with different technologies, they may not be optimal.  What do objective
<br>
individual rights mean in the face of the Borg?  They won't keep you
<br>
from being assimilated.
