<em>&gt; Mark is right in pointing at it as an distinguishing aspect of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable sense of the word from many other views. It is also very easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be made obsolete as technology develops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### But then how will you in a concise manner refer to the &quot;central meme&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need to have a name for it - it's easier to explain it to strangers if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a word for it.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think the idea of technology being the central meme
<br>
is horribly wrong, and if we present ourselves based on *that*
<br>
we will lose much. 
<br>
<p>As Mark Walker pointed out, technological transformation is
<br>
really just one part of a triad of ideas
<br>
(<a href="http://www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm">http://www.markalanwalker.com/what.htm</a> : &quot;1. The Technology
<br>
Thesis: Within a hundred years humanity will possess the
<br>
technology to reengineer Homo sapiens.  2. The Ideal Thesis: The
<br>
goal in the reengineering task is to perfect ourselves. 3. The
<br>
Ethical Thesis: We ought to employ technology to realize this
<br>
ideal.&quot;). The technology part is just a means to an end, and if
<br>
you leave out this end transhumanism becomes arbitrary. It
<br>
cannot be a motivator for anything else than promoting cool
<br>
toys.  Transhumanism is commonly criticized as being mere
<br>
technophilia, and seeing the core of transhumanism as technology
<br>
reinforces this. There is nothing wrong with liking technology,
<br>
but aren't we aiming higher than that? Saying that tech can
<br>
change us doesn't say what changes are desirable or not.
<br>
<p>The central meme of socialism isn't government control, the
<br>
central meme of libertarianism isn't free markets. They are just
<br>
means to ends (equality and liberty, among others). 
<br>
<p>I think the concept &quot;the central meme of transhumanism&quot; ought to
<br>
be staked through the heart and buried behind an event horizon -
<br>
it is too dangerous and seductive through its apparent
<br>
simplicity, catchiness and ecumenism. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, how do you motivate the exclusion of nazis? You cannot motivate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it by saying they are not transhuman, so you have to motivate it from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other core values, or in that while their views are acceptable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views they hurt the movement in a practical political sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### All you need is say they are bad people and you do not want to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything to do with them. If you are at a quantum physics conference, you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not need to prove that the scientific views of Nazis are wrong, you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kick them out because they are in your opinion evil.
</em><br>
<p>If somebody brings up nazi ideas in quantum physics, they are
<br>
clearly not speaking in the right forum, and hence excluding
<br>
them doesn't have to be based on a value statement. But what if
<br>
the nazi is speaking about an issue in a suitable forum, like a
<br>
political one? Can you exclude him for being evil in your
<br>
opinion? In that case, what about freedom of speech for people
<br>
with unpopular opinions? (Of course, in privately run forums I
<br>
would say the proprietor has the right to set up the debate
<br>
limits as he or she wishes, but there is still a great deal of
<br>
difference between somebody who bases his actions on clear
<br>
principles and somebody who acts depending on some unknowable
<br>
whim)
<br>
<p>I can, given my view that transhumanism is indeed based in
<br>
humanism, firmly say that a nazi post (even when dealing with
<br>
the subject) in a transhumanist forum is wrong in the same way:
<br>
nazism is fundamentally incompatible with transhumanism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Same with an ecumenical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist organization devoted to the furtherance of human enhancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies - you agree to disagree on a lot of issues (like Rifkinites and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the church when talking about reproductive medicine) but you work together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on things you can agree on. If somebody's views are beyond the pale, you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not argue - you exclude them by fiat.
</em><br>
<p>This is a great example on why core values are important. If you
<br>
were sitting in the same organization as Rifkin and the Church
<br>
and only trying to base your decisions on the view that humans
<br>
can technologically enhance themselves, you would never have any
<br>
arguments in favor of doing this other than some practical
<br>
benefits, and they would always have firm arguments why it was
<br>
unethical. People may agree to do something because it is very
<br>
practical, but if they at the same time learn that it is
<br>
unethical they will gladly give it up for something else
<br>
whenever possible. When somebody constantly undermines your
<br>
ethical position any real political progress will be temporary -
<br>
&quot;OK, we will agree to your proposal to allow research on bionic
<br>
implants, but only for restoring health - the bill has to
<br>
include a provision saying that enhancements are unethical and
<br>
any research towards them is explicitely forbidden. Similarly,
<br>
for the reproductive cloning, it will be allowed after the
<br>
parents have undergone councelling with a number of genetic
<br>
councellors *we* select.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course one can work together with people with fundamentally
<br>
different core values - often it is necessary. But if you do not
<br>
have core values that reach beyond a liking for certain
<br>
technology you will find yourself subverted and your work
<br>
becoming used to further agendas far different from your own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### If you truly believe eugenics is evil, exclude eugenicists, or if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't, form an organization which specifically opposes that.
</em><br>
<p>On what grounds? Because the word has a bad ring? Because you
<br>
say so? What makes &quot;Transhumanists against Eugenics&quot; more valid
<br>
than &quot;Transhumanists against Democracy?&quot;. In your view there is
<br>
no reason to favor one over the other, except political
<br>
expediency. I would say that there is very good reasons to favor
<br>
the first, not just out of expediency but because coercive
<br>
policies tend to hinder human development and can easily be
<br>
abused, and that democracy in most of its forms are far more
<br>
humanistic than any other government. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, and I think this is a more severe problem, is that trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeal to a lot of people by having more diluted values or ideology will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that you get more people importing their own favorite ideologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the movement and more people who don't get understand whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central values there are and are more into it for the community or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You can always have a restricted-entry organization for the special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, and a free-entry club for the proles. The two together can achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more, without spoiling the experience for anybody (at least initially).
</em><br>
<p>Inner and Outer circles seldom work, since they tend to get out
<br>
of sync (as well as the usual sociopsychological problems of
<br>
in-groups and out-groups, power struggles and &quot;my conspiracy is
<br>
better than yours&quot;). The &quot;elite&quot; may have the core values and
<br>
ideology, but without them the other organisation will start
<br>
drifting ideologically on its own.
<br>
<p>A good example is the swedish liberal party Folkpartiet. When
<br>
asked, their chief ideologist gave us quite transhumanist and
<br>
libertarian answers to a number of questions. At the same time,
<br>
the politicians of the party have been protecting liberty by
<br>
supporting bans on behaviors that may be dangerous (like going
<br>
by car without seatbelt, harsh rules against drug use and
<br>
prostitution), more regulation of the markets in the interests
<br>
of equality and freedom (including the state monopoly on alcohol
<br>
sales), and supported many very restrictive laws on research in
<br>
genetics. There is a total discrepancy between the &quot;inner party&quot;
<br>
and the &quot;outer party&quot; that actually does the political work.
<br>
This is what not taking ideology seriously leads to.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  As an example, compare this list now with how it was several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years back in terms of actual idea production: the huge increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity of people on the list has not led to an increase in quality or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even quantity of ideas. Some of the old issues of Extropy are composed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a large extent of threads from the list, with amazing insight and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### But then, the low-lying fruit has been picked already. How much more can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you say about the right way of approaching the Singularity without new data?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New arrivals cannot keep inventing the wheel all over again, and building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaceship takes time.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, many of the ideas that were discussed were hardly
<br>
low-lying fruits: transhumanist architecture, utility fogs, idea
<br>
futures, reputation systems etc. 
<br>
<p>And there is plenty of important stuff this side of the
<br>
singularity: how to shape societies, economies, institutions,
<br>
legal systems and careers to handle the predicted dynamic high
<br>
tech society? How to handle the problem of destruction from
<br>
replicating technology? What ethical, aesthetic and cultural
<br>
principles to promote in order to produce a transhumanist
<br>
society? How would a transhumanist society even work? - these
<br>
questions have hardly been developed, new data is arriving daily
<br>
and they ought to be high priority for all of us. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Third, what use are the masses? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Demonstrations, marches, security, letter-writing. Don't underestimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value of a bunch of stalwart believers, even if their thinking is not as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine as their leadership's.
</em><br>
<p>Having a lot of people supporting you is good if your ideas are
<br>
regarded as part of the serious discussion. That don't happen
<br>
because you have many supporters, but rather because your ideas
<br>
are shown to be relevant to current policies, have a cultural
<br>
and ideological impact and convince key people. *Then* the big
<br>
campaigns might be truly useful, but before that it is a blunt
<br>
weapon. Most elites regard million man marches as more relevant
<br>
in that they show that somebody has organisational ability than
<br>
in that there are a lot of people out there. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But I question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point in having a million members in WTA or ExI if their membership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't *mean* anything. A far more successful strategy is to create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real world view (and a world-view is far more than a view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology!), make the intellectuals and cultural leaders recognize it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then watch the mainstream move in your direction. It has worked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Why not take both roads?
</em><br>
<p>I want to invest effort rationally. They payoff in the
<br>
intellectual sphere is far greater than in the mainstream
<br>
sphere. If I can convince one intellectual (in Hayek's sense of
<br>
the group of people in society that process and spread ideas),
<br>
then he will go on convincing other intellectuals and spreading
<br>
the idea to the masses. Intellectuals certainly listen to the
<br>
masses and do pick up ideas, but usually the memeflow is in the
<br>
other direction. This means that the same effort in spreading an
<br>
idea is likely to produce a far greater (and faster replicating)
<br>
return if I concentrate on the cultural leaders.
<br>
<p>At the same time, a certain mix is beneficial since there is
<br>
also the issue of declining marginal effects of my effort. Using
<br>
one unit of effort produces (say) 1 units of intellectual memes,
<br>
two 1.4 units, three 1.7 units, four 2 units and so on
<br>
(sqrt(effort)). Meanwhile (say) preaching to the masses produces
<br>
half of that. In that case, the total result of x units of
<br>
effort on the intellectuals and T-x units on the masses gives me
<br>
sqrt(x)+.5*sqrt(T-x) units of result, which has a maximum at
<br>
x=(4/5)T units - spend most of your effort on the intellectuals,
<br>
but some on others. 
<br>
<p>Note that the above example assumed a fairly small difference in
<br>
effect between cultural leaders and the rest - if it is larger
<br>
the specialization becomes even more strong. 
<br>
<p>Ouch, I dislike talking about the &quot;masses&quot;. Makes me sound like
<br>
a technocrat. I *love* talking to random people! But to have
<br>
maximal cultural impact you have to talk to the right people.
