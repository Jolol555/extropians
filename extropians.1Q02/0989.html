Robert, what are you objecting to?
<br>
<p>I'd said, as you show (I paraphrase slightly):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Those sorry offspring at X-class-universities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who have Y
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; heaped upon them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without suffering 
</em><br>
<p>[that is, a delimited sub-set of those at X-class; Some not All; Iba nor Aba]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;will come to no good
</em><br>
<p>You retorted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hey!  I went to an X [on the basis of]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precious little &quot;inherited Y&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>So, you're a member of the sub-class I excluded--and you managed to come to
<br>
no good even so. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I actually think much of the accumulated wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the endowments goes into salary competition for the accumulation of Nobel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prize winning professors. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the relevance to my point, which was that those who bleat about
<br>
`evil' communistic/socialistic `free' education for all never seem to worry
<br>
about `virtuous' rich-parent-pays-&amp;-kid-gets-in-`free' education. 
<br>
<p>(You'll see of course that this leaves out of the discussion entirely other
<br>
groups such as the virtuous poor who hock their futures to a loan, or work
<br>
while studying, etc.) 
<br>
<p>In fact, one could agree with me and go further, asserting that the
<br>
inherited wealth currently used by the rich to pay for the education of
<br>
their offspring might instead be sequestered (as a wise donation,
<br>
naturally, not an enforced tax, from the rich--who wish to see their kids
<br>
spared the spoiling horrors of getting unearned benefits) for the precise
<br>
purpose of hiring terrific teachers... but not just for the rich people's
<br>
kids. 
<br>
<p>Obviously that is not a strict consequence of my comment, and is vulnerable
<br>
to the usual objection that spreading such a bonanza among the masses would
<br>
water it down to the point where *all* excellent teaching would be lost.
<br>
More saliently, it could be used to create, as you say,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;in the age of the internet, [...] an opportunity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sould become more distributed.  With more people taking classes from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the real sages in a discipline educations would have a higher quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a lower cost.
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed. In fact I'd like to see a whole range of educational methods
<br>
trialed, from the classic anarchistic Summerhill method (which doesn't work
<br>
all that well, alas--I have several friends who either went to such places
<br>
or taught there) through agoric hire-your-own-teacher to ferocious boot
<br>
camps of the mind.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Damien
<br>
