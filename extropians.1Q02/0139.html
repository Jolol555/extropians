Subject: Re: [HAYEK-L:] Rummel Seminar Intro
<br>
<p>My thanks to Greg Ransom for setting up this seminar, and for the very
<br>
idea of these seminars itself. What a great informative and stimulating
<br>
way to intellectually and professional interact, especially across our
<br>
academic and conceptual iron walls.
<br>
<p>Before getting into the _Saving Lives_ book I have asked you to read (at
<br>
<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.COVER.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.COVER.HTM</a>), a preliminary note. The
<br>
genesis of this book is in my Army years spent in Japan during the
<br>
Korean War. From what I came to know of Japanese, I couldn't understand
<br>
why we would make war on each other. So when I subsequently found out in
<br>
college that I could study war as part of political science, I focused
<br>
on understanding its nature and causes. This was the major focus of my
<br>
undergraduate and graduate years, then of my academic research. Of
<br>
course, to understand war I had also to study violence and conflict
<br>
generally, and broaden my study across the social sciences and
<br>
humanities. In the process my political views moved from that of a
<br>
democratic socialist to those of a libertarian (except in foreign
<br>
policy) as I read widely in philosophy and economics.
<br>
<p>My final theoretical and empirical findings on war and violence, well
<br>
confirmed by replications or unsuccessful attempts in the literature to
<br>
prove them wrong, were that there was an inverse causal relationship of
<br>
democratic freedom to political and government violence. Moreover, these
<br>
findings also showed that government murdered more people than died in
<br>
combat in all domestic and foreign wars, perhaps on the order of more
<br>
than 4 to 1. I thought these findings on war, violence, and government
<br>
murder of such importance for what they implied about ending such horror
<br>
that I had to try to get the results into the political and media
<br>
mainstream. Therefore, I set up my web site to provide references,
<br>
theory, data, and evidence; and I wrote a nontechnical book called the
<br>
_Miracle that is Freedom_ (no religious meaning intended). _Saving
<br>
Lives_ is the successor to this book.
<br>
<p>Through my _Power Kills_ I also tried to communicate to professionals,
<br>
especially teachers, the power of freedom to end or reduce war and
<br>
violence generally, and I provided the
<br>
figures/tables/footnotes/references/sources that would make
<br>
professionals feel more comfortable about my claims. The summary and
<br>
some important chapters of Power Kills are on my web site at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE6.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE6.HTM</a>
<br>
<p>The connection of all this to Hayek is through his idea of a spontaneous
<br>
society (or in my theoretical terms, a social field) and concepts of
<br>
organization (antifield) and democracy, not to mention his general
<br>
emphasis on freedom. I believe that we can conceptually, theoretically,
<br>
and empirically move from his idea of a spontaneous society produced by
<br>
individual freedom and his concepts to the following assertions
<br>
presented in _Saving Lives_:
<br>
<p>1. Democracies (spontaneous societies) have never made war on each
<br>
other. Researchers have well-established this in international
<br>
relations, which labels this finding the &quot;democratic peace.&quot;  This means
<br>
that we likely now have a solution to war, and the spontaneous society
<br>
is at the heart of it.
<br>
<p>2. The more democratic nations are, the less likely they will make war
<br>
on or direct violence at each other.
<br>
<p>3. The more democratic nations are, the less severe their domestic
<br>
collective violence.
<br>
<p>4. The more democratic nations are, the less their domestic democide
<br>
(genocide and government mass murder). Liberal democracies have
<br>
virtually no domestic democide (as noted, the greatest killer of modern
<br>
times, over four times more than international and domestic war
<br>
together), and therefore, such freedom is also appears a solution to the
<br>
problem of murder by government. This is another result of the
<br>
spontaneous society.
<br>
<p>5. Therefore, democracy is a method of nonviolence.
<br>
<p>6. The more democratic nations are, the less likely they will have
<br>
famines, and the less deadly they will be. Democracies have never had a
<br>
famine and such freedom thus appears a solution to this problem as well.
<br>
This result is entailed by the usual libertarian arguments for a free
<br>
market, and to which we should add the sensitivity of democratic
<br>
politicians to potential disaster and the relative efficiency of a free
<br>
press in conveying relevant information.
<br>
<p>7. Democracy inherently promotes economic development (wealth). There
<br>
may well be a causal loop, where the more freedom, the more economic
<br>
development, and the more economic development, the more freedom.
<br>
<p>In sum, the closer we are to Hayek's spontaneous society actualized as
<br>
liberal democracy, the greater the human security. Were all nations to
<br>
become spontaneous societies with a democratic government recognizing
<br>
political rights and civil liberties, we may well predict that the
<br>
resulting invisible hand would eliminate war, democide, and famine and
<br>
maximize human wealth and health.
<br>
<p>Hayek wrote little on peace or violence. There are some tidbits in his
<br>
_Law, Legislation and Liberty_, however, that are consistent with the
<br>
above claims:
<br>
<p>Vol. 1, p. 72. &quot;... only the observance of common rules makes the
<br>
peaceful existence of individuals in society possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>Vol. 2, p. 91. &quot;... the principle of the equal treatment of all menSis
<br>
probably the only chance for peace.&quot;
<br>
<p>Vol. 2, p. 109. &quot;The discovery that by substituting abstract rules of
<br>
conduct for obligatory concrete ends made it possible to extend the
<br>
order of peace beyond the small groups pursuing the same endsS.The
<br>
decisive step which made such peaceful collaboration possible in the
<br>
absence of concrete common purposes was the adoption of barter or
<br>
exchange.&quot;
<br>
<p>Vol. 2, p. 165, n 12. &quot;That 'general obligation to help and sustain one
<br>
another' which Max GluckmanS describes as characteristic of the tribal
<br>
society and especially the kinship groupS is incompatible with [the
<br>
Great Society] and its abandonment is part of the price we pay for the
<br>
achievement of a more extensive order of peace.&quot;
<br>
<p>Vol. 3, p. xiii. &quot;I profoundly believe in the basic principles of
<br>
democracy as the only effective method which we have yet discovered of
<br>
making peaceful change possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>Vol. 3, p. 135. &quot;It is the crucial contention of this book that what in
<br>
a society of free men can alone justify coercion is a predominant
<br>
opinion on the principles which ought to govern and restrain individual
<br>
conduct. It is obvious that a peaceful and prosperous society can exist
<br>
only if some such rules are general obeyed and, when necessary,
<br>
enforced.&quot;
<br>
<p>If what I wrote in _Saving Lives_ is all true, which I claim on
<br>
empirical and theoretical grounds, then is not freedom miraculous in its
<br>
power? And does this not all argue that the preeminent foreign, defense,
<br>
and domestic policy of democracies should be to foster freedom?
<br>
<p>A Happy and Successful New Year to the fine members of this list.
