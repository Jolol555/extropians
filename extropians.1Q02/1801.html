Japanese savings switching to gold
<br>
<p>By Taizo Hirose, Takahiko Hyuga and Miki Anzai
<br>
Bloomberg News Service
<br>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese consumers are buying more gold as they decide to take
<br>
their money out of banks before April, when the government caps its
<br>
deposit guarantee.

<br>
<p>I have a recommendation here.  Short of adopting a free banking system,
<br>
Japan could phase out [government ] deposit insurance over the next few
<br>
years.  The transition might be a little less painful that way, but the
<br>
long run result would be a more robust banking system.  Why?  Depositors
<br>
would evaluate banks based on the mix of risk and return -- rather than
<br>
not worrying about that up to the limit of the deposit insurance.  It
<br>
could then move to other reforms in banking -- ones aimed at removing
<br>
other government interferences in the banking system as recommended by,
<br>
e.g., Kevin Dowd.  (I don't think private deposit insurance would arise
<br>
or if it did arise it would become widespread.  In the past, under
<br>
mostly free banking systems, risk of loss of deposit was mainly avoided
<br>
through asset management and prudent operation.  Even if private deposit
<br>
insurance arose and became widespread, chances are the system would be
<br>
much better because depositors could evaluate banks based on their
<br>
insurance rating and coverage.)
<br>
<p>Relurking!
