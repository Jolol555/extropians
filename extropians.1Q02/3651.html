<em>&gt; On Star Trek, all you normally see are the people aboard the

</em><br>
<p>I didn't see Voyager as so politically correct, because as often as not,
<br>
the 'politically correct' solution to problems presented turned out to
<br>
be a *supremely dumb idea* in the end, usually in situations where
<br>
Voyager acted based on humane premises but without all the facts of the
<br>
situation, which seems to mirror the frequent failed liberal attempts at
<br>
foreign policy in the last decade. Perhaps being used to TNG and DSN, I
<br>
saw Voyager as a significant improvement. Note that there is no one
<br>
clique of writers for Star Trek's modern series', many different fans
<br>
and writers of different types have written episodes, which obviously
<br>
contributes to not only the inconsistencies, but the odds that at least
<br>
some episodes were written by communist/socialist sympathizers.

<p>We've already given them foreign aid, something like a half billion
<br>
dollars or more during the Clinton era. Thats no bet.
