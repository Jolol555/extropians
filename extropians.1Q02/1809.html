<em>&gt; Man, you guys must really hate your jobs.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, this definition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is really pretty sad. Just say someone had an idea about what they really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to do, hmm, like research into nanotechnology, and went out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquired the skills. If said person then managed to get work in that field,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the work they wanted, what would you call that employment arrangement? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paid hobby?
</em><br>
<p>Well, my favorite hobbies are, not necessarily in this order:
<br>
<p>1) sleeping
<br>
2) fishing
<br>
3) hunting
<br>
4) reading/writing
<br>
5) playing with computers
<br>
6) graphic design
<br>
7) playing with rockets
<br>
8) skiing
<br>
9) inventing things
<br>
<p>My last position combined 4,5, and 6 pretty well, but I still didn't
<br>
enjoy the work, because it was work oriented toward someone else's
<br>
goals, they were very bad at taking my advice, and they were delinquent
<br>
in pay raises despite professing to love my work. I consider a large
<br>
chunk of the 4.5 years I spent with them to be 'dead' time.
<br>
<p>It is possible to do the things you love for work but still be bored
<br>
stiff and dissatisfied. Similarly, I've worked on and off as a ski
<br>
instructor for many years. Full time ski instructing is highly
<br>
debilitating upon ones love of the sport. A few years I skied so much
<br>
that I was relieved the season was over, and I stuck my skis in the
<br>
closet and didn't want to look at them till the next winter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point here is that you could actually make money doing what you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do, and use that money to extend your life. This very cruddy tradeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship of Mike's, where you count hours worked = hours dead, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then not apply (which I don't think it does anyway).
</em><br>
<p>The point is that even of those who do what they want to do for a
<br>
living, working it full time doesn't really compare to spending the same
<br>
hours with family, friends, or doing other things as they strike your
<br>
fancy, not as demanded by a work schedule. Of those who do what they
<br>
want for a living, only a small fraction would rather do that work than
<br>
relaxing and enjoying life.
<br>
<p>Man is not an automaton, and the 40 hour work week is the last vestige
<br>
of industrial tyranny over the individual.
