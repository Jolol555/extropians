ANNOUNCING: FDAReview.org -- New Website Tracks Unsafe Side Effects of
<br>
Federal Food and Drug Regulations
<br>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was created to ensure the
<br>
safety of food, and the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and
<br>
medical devices, marketed in the United States. A large body of academic
<br>
research, however, indicates that FDA control has large and often
<br>
overlooked costs that almost certainly exceed the costs. This is no
<br>
&quot;academic&quot; or strictly economic matter: FDA policies in many cases have
<br>
cost people their lives.
<br>
<p>To bring this research to a larger number of health-care professionals,
<br>
policy analysts, journalists, government officials, and the general
<br>
public, the Independent Institute has launched FDAReview.org
<br>
<a href="http://www.FDAReview.org">http://www.FDAReview.org</a>, an extensive, peer-reviewed, resource of
<br>
critical research on the policies and history of the U.S. Food and Drug
<br>
Administration.
<br>
<p>Written and edited by Independent Institute Research Fellow Daniel Klein
<br>
(Associate Professor of Economics, Santa Clara University) and
<br>
Independent Institute Research Director Alex Tabarrok (Editor,
<br>
Entrepreneurial Economics: Bright Ideas from the Dismal Science),
<br>
FDAReview.org includes:
<br>
<p>* a detailed history of federal regulation from 1902 to the present,
<br>
<p>* information on the drug development and approval process,
<br>
<p>* an evaluation of the costs and benefits of FDA policy,
<br>
<p>* a review and evaluation of the major plans for FDA reform,
<br>
<p>* comments from economists who have studied the FDA,
<br>
<p>* a glossary and bibliography with many webbed links (including links to
<br>
JSTOR, a scholarly journal archive, for those with access)
<br>
<p>With FDAReview.org, the Independent Institute intends to increase public
<br>
awareness of bureaucratic and political barriers that prevent lifesaving
<br>
medicines from reaching health-care consumers, especially for those most
<br>
in need. Comments are always welcome as we plan to continually update
<br>
and improve the web site.
