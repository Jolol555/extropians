</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that this is either false or irrelevant. I agree that there
<br>
will always be 'power envy', and there's not a lot you can do about that.
<br>
However, in this particular case the CIA &amp; ISI throughout the 80s explicitly
<br>
encouraged, financed and trained militant Islamic groups in Afghanistan as a
<br>
way of fighting a proxy war against the Soviet Union. Specific individuals
<br>
who benefited from this US money and training included one Usama Bin Laden.
<br>
I've posted some of the sources for this material previously. Note that at
<br>
this time, the US were explicitly encouraging Islamic fundamentalism,
<br>
presumably because the people they killed (Soviet troops) were useful to US
<br>
foreign policy goals.
<br>
<p>Whatever the merits of this strategy at the time, with hindsight the
<br>
description 'unwise' seems highly appropriate. The lesson to be learnt is
<br>
surely that today's apparently  desirable foreign policy goals become
<br>
tomorrow's blowback disaster. There is surely no reason to assume that
<br>
current US (or any other country, for that matter) foreign policy is any
<br>
less fallible?
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
