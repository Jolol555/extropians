Quick thoughts before I hit the sack;
<br>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the programme, which treated the whole 
<br>
issue fairly, and was absent of the scare tatics often employed in this 
<br>
type of programming.
<br>
<p>It tells of the recent ATC cloning advance ( which has been discussed 
<br>
here), and of the American Judson Somerville, paralysed in an accident and 
<br>
hoping that this technology will mature to the stage were it can provide a 
<br>
viable treatment for his condition.
<br>
<p>Also mentioned was the possibility of using this technology to replace 
<br>
damaged organs and slowing ageing.
<br>
<p>The programme also talked about a couple who had identical triplets late 
<br>
last year, and how these children were natural &quot;clones&quot;.  There was also a 
<br>
segment regarding a couple who have a severely handicapped son, who is not 
<br>
likely to live past his 10th birthday.  The father wanted to clone him in 
<br>
the future, whereas the mother was opposed (although not vehemently) to the 
<br>
idea.
<br>
<p>All in all, it was pretty good.  There are another 2 parts, and I'll post a 
<br>
small commentary on them here.
<br>
<p>Goodnight all,
<br>
<p><p>James....
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
