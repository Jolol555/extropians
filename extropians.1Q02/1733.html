<em>&gt; &gt; That is another possible counter-argument: if extending the end-point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of one's existence (even at the expense of &quot;life&quot; time as defined above)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sufficiently increases the likelihood of technology becoming available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that makes up for the work spent getting there, then you've won the bet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a bet I'm willing to take.  I do believe that future technology will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much more advanced than today.  The doubling time for biology knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is under two years now.  That means that delaying death just a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years might double my chances of survival.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Again, the choice is not between dying and spending money: the choice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; between spending, say, 3 years working to get 1 &quot;extra&quot; year of free time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or just spending 1 year working and 2 years in free time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; directly.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I would never trade my life for some free time.  Why not retire now, live on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare, and die early if you desire free time?  I rather work hard and keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going for a very long time.  I have a very strong survival instinct.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see giving up and dying just because it's easier.  If I can work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harder and prolong my life, I want to do it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible factor in that equation is one's enjoyment of work: if one's work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is very close to what one would otherwise choose to do anyway, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time lost can be discounted by some rate, possibly making it a good deal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't imagine having a job I hated so much that I would wish for an early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death rather than keeping my job.  This sounds almost suicidal.  No matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what level of comfort I have, I will probably keep working toward getting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the *next* level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for your insights!  They are perfectly wonderful and logical, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on different choices than my own.  It is always fascinating to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative world views.
</em><br>
<p>Our world-views aren't that far apart.  I'm certainly not going to
<br>
retire anytime soon, because the things I enjoy doing (i.e., &quot;life&quot;)
<br>
do require a certain level of income.  So I have a pleasant not-too-
<br>
stressful job that earns me enough to have a nice place, a decent
<br>
car, good food, computer toys, poker games, and the occasional
<br>
Extro conference.  I could earn more if I devoted more time to work,
<br>
and I could probably live longer if I devoted less time to good
<br>
food and driving, but neither of those things is so valuable to me
<br>
that I'm willing to become a stressed-out workaholic.
<br>
<p>Probably our major divergence is that I am a skeptic about the
<br>
&quot;singularity&quot; and other sudden, drastic leaps in technology.  I'm
<br>
just not willing to bet my quality of life on the proposition that
<br>
quantity will turn into quality at some point in the future.  I
<br>
want quality now. Of course I want it in the future too, so I have
<br>
the Alcor backup plan; that seems like a reasonable investment to
<br>
me.  But I would never go so far as, say, calorie restriction--
<br>
that would be a major sacrifice of quality that would /only/ be
<br>
repaid if technology becomes available to make those later years
<br>
great, and I just don't want to bet on that.
<br>
<p>Back to the topic of this thread, though, I think Robin's points
<br>
were quite valid: sometimes seeing a doctor or buying health
<br>
insurance isn't as good a bet as it looks.  But I'm certainly
<br>
not arguing that one should never do those things, just that one
<br>
should rationally evaluate the pros and cons, and at least
<br>
consider forgoing them in some cases rather than reflexively
<br>
thinking of them as &quot;necessary&quot;.
