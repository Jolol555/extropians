<em>&gt; Let's say that there are a hundred people on an island (let's call it Spaceship Earth); the majority, say 85, eat meat and vegetables, but realizing that their numbers are growing and that latrine space is overtaking cattle range and farmland, a few are working on ways to get our eggs out of a tiny basket before we all die of overpopulation-induced pollution and starvation.  Let's say that the other fifteen have sworn fealty to a murderous Thugee ideology, and the only people they will not kill are their own.  What are the 85 to do?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the minority eat meat and vegetables and consume most
<br>
of the resources and wealth, of course they arguably produce
<br>
much of it too.   One option is to create more resource and
<br>
distribute them more broadly.  And also it might be good to eat
<br>
less meat so not so much habitat is consumed feeding cattle. :)  
<br>
<p>Of course there is no 85% fine people who are protective and 15%
<br>
who are murderous.  It is highly artificial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) Hunt down and convert, or, failing that, kill the 15 so that all may live their lives unendangered and those working on liberation may continue.
</em><br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 2) Join the 15 to avoid being murdered.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Blithely ignore the 15 and hope that one's own number does not come up.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Try to understand the killers as members of an alternative yet equally valid lifestyle and attempt constructive and nonjudgemental dialogue with them.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) Assert that the 85 deserve such a fate because of real or imagined historical wrongs and await their fate with a sense that an incomprehensibele (or maybe comprehensible, but these would most likely convert) divine justice was being meted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I stand squarely with alternative #1.  I see Samantha as embracing alternatives #4 or #5 or perhaps a syncretism of the two.
</em><br>
<p>That is very dishonest.  I do not claim that killers are of an
<br>
equally valid lifestyle.  I do claim and am quite correct in
<br>
this that the terrorist have at least some claims of wrong-doing
<br>
that should be examined on their own merits regardless of the
<br>
source.  Where we are in the wrong and can improve things we
<br>
should in the interest of greater peace and well-being for
<br>
working toward liberation.  But that doesn't mean we condone
<br>
terrorism in the least or do not punish it.  
<br>
<p>And I most certainly never said or implied (5).  My interest is
<br>
in getting to &quot;liberation&quot; (Singularity) with as many of our
<br>
fellow sentients on board as possible.  I think you can get more
<br>
on board by addressing real grievances even while ending
<br>
barbaric acts of terrorism of all kinds.   I believe you will
<br>
get more people on board by welcoming more people on board
<br>
whenver you can without inviting your destruction.  
<br>
<p>Is that clear enough?
