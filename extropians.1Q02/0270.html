<p>Two suggestions. First, insisting that freedom and responsability are
<br>
something nice to have on an individual basis strikes me as not the
<br>
right course (it may be the course taken by Ayn Rand's novels, but I
<br>
haven't read them so I don't know). It so happens that this only
<br>
appeals to very few people (the ones with high self-confidence), which
<br>
is probably the reason why libertarian ideas are still so marginally
<br>
accepted. But when people realize that personal freedom and
<br>
responsability must be protected for the society to flourish and solve
<br>
its problems, then, if the argument is convincing, it should appeal to
<br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>### In the above paragraph and in the one below you describe the two reasons
<br>
why liberalism is not widely accepted - and I agree with you totally.
<br>
<p>For an ideology to be accepted, it has to appeal to the most basic needs of
<br>
humans. It has to appeal to the will to survive (e.g. by providing a hope of
<br>
an afterlife, or a social safety net). Appeals to other ideals (justice,
<br>
liberty, reason) are successfull only insofar they interact with the basics.
<br>
If you ever pose a choice between freedom (e.g, to reach the stars or to
<br>
starve) and survival (as in a guaranteed full belly), survival wins hands
<br>
down.
<br>
<p>------ 
<br>
<p>The other suggestion is that much of it should be modelable into a
<br>
computer simulation. Doing the modeling, then showing what happens
<br>
when you add a law, etc., should be enlightening. (One obvious
<br>
difficulty is that one of the main virtue of freedom is invention
<br>
brought by diversity, and invention doesn't seem very easy to model ;
<br>
but you could use genetical algorithms on a specific solution space for
<br>
that.)
<br>
<p>### This is the other reason for liberty's failure - most modern humans do
<br>
not possess sufficient knowledge and intellectual modelling capacity to
<br>
understand that taking shortcuts by uninhibited exploitation of other
<br>
persons' work leads to a net loss to almost all involved, almost always. It
<br>
took thousands of years to end slavery - and it ended not because the
<br>
slavers actually understood how maladaptive it was in the long run, but
<br>
because societies without it grew richer and stronger, showing empirically
<br>
that freedom works better. 
<br>
<p>The connection between a state-guaranteed pension and your enhanced survival
<br>
is &quot;obvious&quot; to almost everybody. The connection between the taxes and
<br>
enforcement apparatus needed to support such benefits, and reduced overall
<br>
economic performance (which then leads to reduced survival), is apparent
<br>
only to a few.
<br>
<p>If the above is true, the for liberalism to succeed you need: an average IQ
<br>
equivalent to today's IQ of 120, and a reinterpretation of the basic tenets
<br>
of liberalism in terms of survival of all innocent humans.
<br>
<p>Maybe the Singularity will help.
