<p>Thanks Brian. And thanks for the great forum to post it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are many situations where men and women working together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn to deal effectively with &quot;sexual tension&quot; and I see no reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the military should be any different.
</em><br>
<p>First let me say that I am a firm advocate of equality and integration for 
<br>
women and gays and everyone else that have been traditionally excluded 
<br>
from various white-male-only jobs or professions, including the military.  
<br>
My concerns are for frontline infantry and combat arms units like tanks 
<br>
and artillery.  Yes, in our everyday peacetime lives we all learn to deal 
<br>
effectively (success levels vary of course) with inevitable sexual 
<br>
tension.  The reason the frontline military is different is that foxholes, 
<br>
trenches, jungles, and deserts, in a war, are completely different from 
<br>
any other human arena.  Frontline combat is a life and death struggle.  
<br>
Emotions are high, continuously, days and weeks on end.  Life is extremely 
<br>
difficult, both emotionally and physically.  The spectre of death is all 
<br>
around, always in your face.  Thoughts of death constantly present.  Add 
<br>
to that a preponderance of very young adults at the pinnacle of their 
<br>
physical sexuality and the base of their emotional maturity and sexual 
<br>
experience.  
<br>
<p>Winning on the battlefield is a function of mind as much as physical power 
<br>
or strength.  Keeping those young minds focused, motivated, inspired, and 
<br>
under control is a very very difficult leadership challenge. Breakdowns in 
<br>
mental and emotional discipline hinder combat effectiveness.  
<br>
Historically, the army that does the best job of keeping its personnel 
<br>
focused on winning is usually the army that wins.  As I said before, the 
<br>
issue is not can women endure or fight just as well as men.  The issue is 
<br>
how much combat effectiveness are we willing to sacrifice to include women 
<br>
in frontline combat units, interjecting a very significant mental and 
<br>
emotional detractor into an arena where life and death are the prize for 
<br>
winning and losing?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The military has it's own double standards about sex (male officers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may date female enlisteds but not vice versa) and is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistant to change.
</em><br>
<p>That's not my exactly my experience Brian, though I agree that double 
<br>
standards exist all over the place, right along with good-ol-boy networks 
<br>
and glass ceilings.  In most places that I served fraternization either 
<br>
way was taboo.  But certainly abuses and double standards still exist.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But the fact is many (including myself) see it as morally wrong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclude homosexuals from service to their country. As a former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marine (1975-1979) I know I wasn't too fond of the concept when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; served, but I was also young and had a lot to learn. I learned to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with it at the YMCA and I'm sure others could. Those who can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or won't, should be the ones excluded.
</em><br>
<p>First, &quot;service&quot; does not necessarily have to include integrated frontline 
<br>
combat units.  Second, as noted above frontline combat is a completely 
<br>
different world from anyplace else, including law enforcement, including 
<br>
the YMCA...at least I hope so.  :)   You don't get to go home at night.  
<br>
There is no place to go for privacy.  No time to set up separate bathrooms 
<br>
or sleeping arrangements.  No beds, no time outs, no showers, little 
<br>
sleep.  Physical relationships and emotional bonds extremely close.  Throw 
<br>
sex into that mix, and ok, no doubt some can handle it well.   Others, a 
<br>
significant number of people both male and female will not, and the 
<br>
resulting turmoil will seriously impact combat effectiveness.  IMO.  
<br>
Lastly, I was a Marine from 1978-1983 (Went through OCS at Quantico in 
<br>
1975).  2ndMarDiv Camp Lejeune, 1st Battalion 8th Marines.  Where were you 
<br>
stationed?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The only fair solution I've seen was a fully integrated unit as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portrayed in &quot;Starship Troopers.&quot; &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was the book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that convinced me to join the USMC and I was delighted to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's now on the boot camp recommended reading list.
</em><br>
<p>Yup, read it twice.  However, it's been quite a while since my last 
<br>
reading, before the movie came out.  My recollection (admittedly flawed on 
<br>
occasion) is the book didn't deal with sexual integration at all.  No 
<br>
shower scenes that I can remember.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the fully 
<br>
integrated showers was a Paul Verhoeven creation.
<br>
<p>As far as fair is concerned, there may be ways to achieve combat equality 
<br>
without putting males and females together in frontline units.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Change can be difficult, and so is progress, but essential.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Completely.  But human evolutionary biology doesn't change 
<br>
overnight.  Adapting to technology is one thing.  Changing attitudes about 
<br>
race and sexual orientation, a matter of education and tolerance.  Sex is 
<br>
biology.  The emotions associated with it very hard to change in the short 
<br>
run.  No doubt that over time, given the significant changes we will see 
<br>
in the human species in the coming decades, the sex part will change as 
<br>
well.  And I will grant you that we COULD integrate tomorrow.  My caution 
<br>
is that undoubtedly our combat effectiveness will suffer from doing it.  
<br>
And in a world still filled with Osamas and Sadamms we may pay a very dear 
<br>
price for that particular approach to equality.
<br>
<p>Semper fi,
<br>
<p>Tom Cowper
