</em><br>
<p>This takes on a bit of political militancy in the broadcast, when the
<br>
deaf mother (the short haired brunette) was discussing on camera with
<br>
her older daughter about the implant. The mother has claimed that the
<br>
daughter, who is now 'too old' to receive the implant, freely chose to
<br>
not get it, yet in the discussion on camera, the daughter states that
<br>
the mother decided for her, which the mother quickly tries to correct
<br>
and deny, to which the daughter edits her statement with an &quot;oh, yeah&quot;,
<br>
seeking like any child to please the parent. This indicates to me that
<br>
there is a bit of revisionism going on here (as well as manipulation)
<br>
where the mother is lying about the preferences of her daughter for the
<br>
sake of political expediency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This offers an foresight to when we start to cure aging.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will likely be many who will object, &quot;what if we lose aging?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>A very good point, one I've been trying to make here. Extropians and
<br>
transhumanists need to acknowledge that because the developments we
<br>
advocate will have such an impact upon the daily lives of people that we
<br>
CANNOT help but be political, because that which we advocate IS seen
<br>
specifically as political by those who oppose such developments.
<br>
<p>Because people identify so much of themselves by what we see as
<br>
unimportant limitations, they see the threat of losing those limitations
<br>
as being inherently a political act/attack of negation of their cultural
<br>
identity. We cannot help but become political in this, and we need
<br>
Pro-Act to get itself in gear.
<br>
<p>Fortunately with the Sound and Fury broadcast, I think it did more to
<br>
expose the degree to which the deaf are politically motivated to repress
<br>
their own members healing. The sort of militant belligerancy seen on the
<br>
program by the parents opposed to implants was all I needed to see. It
<br>
was a sort of Carthaginian dedication to a cause, willing to sacrifice
<br>
their child for the sake of a political, nearly religiously dogmatic,
<br>
position that I found truly offensive.
