<em>&gt;From: Spike Jones &lt;<a href="mailto:spike66@attglobal.net?Subject=Re:%20organ%20donation">spike66@attglobal.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Seems like there is a much better way.  Currently there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a chronic shortage of blood, particularly O negative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stanford uses two techniques to deal with the problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both of them bad: first, they call all the regular bleeders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asking for a donation (even if they are not eligible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having bled just last month) which is mildly irritating and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tempts one to just say no, as well as making one less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely to donate in an actual emergency.
</em><br>
<p>O negative blood is the universal donor, so it's always in short
<br>
supply.
<br>
<p>The single reason hospitals are always short of blood? 
<br>
<p>Motorcycles, a motorcycle accident will eat up more blood than a
<br>
week of open heart surgery. When I was a surgical orderly I saw
<br>
motorcycle accident victims eat up 80 units of blood and still not
<br>
survive.
<br>
<p>The economics are bad here, maybe you should have to donate so many
<br>
units before you can even think of purchasing a motorcycle...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Second, they have started taking more blood from each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;donor, jumping directly from 420 to 500 ml.  That is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big of a change for starters, but furthermore they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adjust the size of the donation to the size of the donor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;At 57 kg, I miss that 500 ml more than my 110 kg buddy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who I have talked into donating.
</em><br>
<p>Connsider apheresis, the Lexus of blood donation. I had my usual
<br>
monthly appointment on Saturday, they got two units of prime AB+
<br>
plasma (AB+ plasma is universal) AND two units of platelets. (size
<br>
matters! ;) ) Two units of platelets would normally mean spinning
<br>
down 16-20 units of blood. Since you get your red cells back, you
<br>
don't miss a thing, you replace the platelets in 24 hours. You can
<br>
donate as often as every two weeks. (platelets, 30 days for plasma)
<br>
<p>It's easy, and you sit and watch a movie (The Score) during the
<br>
procedure which can take 2 hours. I go in first thing 07:30 and am
<br>
home by 10:00, with the whole day clear.
<br>
<p>And consider signing up for the National Bone Marrow Registry at
<br>
the same time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What if, instead of offering 20 bucks cash, they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spend 20 bucks on a quickly chemical analysis of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blood, measuring iron levels, sugar, lipids, etc, to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the donor with a few numbers she could keep in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spreadsheet.  This way she could note trends or unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;readings, perhaps providing advance warning of medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems, kind of a free and convenient mini-health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;screening with a bonus warm fuzzy.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a great idea! Actually they would just have to share this
<br>
data, since they test for a wide variety of problems including
<br>
STD's. If they spot a problem they will contact you immediately.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Junkies and drunks would not likely care, and so would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stay away, whereas this system would draw in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worried well, the hypochondriac crowd, the well fed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vitamin-quaffing upwardly mobile, just the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blood you want filling your bank to overflowing.  Could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we not make some kind of electronic chip or device that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measures a dozen different blood chemicals for 20 bucks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each?  I think we can.  Furthermore the recipients would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glaaaaadly pay 20 bucks a unit more for the blood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowing it came from the health conscious, eh? spike
</em><br>
<p>As I mentioned they already make these tests they just need to
<br>
share the data.
<br>
<p>I wasn't aware they had for-pay centers open anymore, I know the
<br>
Red-Cross program I donate to is so rigorous it would easily
<br>
exclude these types.
<br>
<p>I want to encourage eveyone here to donate regularly, Extropians
<br>
are generous.
