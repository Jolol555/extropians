</em><br>
<p><p>In other words I reject the idea that the more intelligent you are
<br>
the more likely you are to be a socialist, I did not say it was
<br>
impossible for an intelligent person to be one.

<p><p><em>&gt;Actually I said,

</em><br>
<p><p>It reads the same to me. Get I get a vote?

<p><p><em>&gt;I said that the thought experiment was &quot;not implausible&quot;, in an

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I already pointed out I did not say it was impossible, lets go back
<br>
to what you did say:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Sound%20and%20Fury&quot;%20over%20enhancements">hal@finney.org</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;As should be clear, I was not making a claim, but advancing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought experiment.  Only the most ideologically arrogant would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that enhancing the intelligence of their children would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guaranteed to make them follow the politics of their parents.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed,
<br>
<p>And the parents of a deaf child who insisted their child remain
<br>
deaf so they could continue to be limited to deaf culture would
<br>
also be guilty of being ideologically arrogant.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;My post was an invitation to consider how it would feel if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did not hold.  Someone with a strong political ideology would then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be put in something of the same position as the deaf parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;today. They might even begin to feel some empathy for the deaf
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parents' situation, rather than the attitudes of contempt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scorn which Mike and others adopted.
</em><br>
<p><p>They might feel the same and they would be equally wrong.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Obviously I failed.  Your ideology has successfully defended
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself by keeping you from seriously considering alternatives.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;congratulate it. It rides you masterfully.  I hope the bit is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comfortable in your mouth.
</em><br>
<p><p>Conversation over... buhbye.
