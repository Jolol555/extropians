<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;The Spirit is willing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the flesh is weak&quot; to Russian by a translation machine.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result supposedly came out to something like, &quot;The Vodka is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the meat is rotten.&quot;...&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>Things have gotten better.  See <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr">http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr</a>
<br>
<p>Using babblefish to translate the phrase The spirit is willing but
<br>
the flesh is weak, from English to French to German to English:
<br>
<p>The spirit is ready, but the flesh is weak.
<br>
<p>Not bad at all.  Now English to German to French to English
<br>
<p>The spirit is ready, but the meat is weak.
<br>
<p>Still, not too bad for two translations.  OK, now &quot;out of sight,
<br>
out of mind&quot;, from English to French to German to English:
<br>
<p>Outside of the view, outside of the spirit.
<br>
<p>I like it!  It almost gets a poetic ring to it that way.  Now English to
<br>
<p>German to French to English:
<br>
<p>Of a sight of entendement outside.
<br>
<p>OK, so I should have quit while I was ahead.  But in any
<br>
case, I have a clear vision of a near future in which a wearable
<br>
computer will be able to do practical speech recognition and
<br>
voice synthesis in close enough to real time and with great
<br>
enough fidelity that practically anyone in the world will be
<br>
able to have a meaningful conversation with practically anyone
<br>
else.  spike
<br>
<p>The above paragraph, from English to German to French to English:
<br>
<p>O K, me should have terminated, me thus taient ahead wahrend. But in
<br>
each case glichem, I have a free sight of a future troit to make a voice
<br>
<p>recognition and a linguistic synthetic practise in which a computer
<br>
wearable
<br>
can, in abschlue enough with Istzeit and the fid enough groer
<br>
which everyone in the world practically can, aussagef
<br>
with practically everyone to have besides. Above else. spik
<br>
<p>{Well, perhaps not *that* near a future}  spik
