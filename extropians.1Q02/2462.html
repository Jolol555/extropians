I found it wasn't bad. I think the concept of listening (input),
<br>
discussing (processing), and voting (output), in succession, was quite
<br>
a good idea, and I thought it was a nice use of the web to let people
<br>
think about something.
<br>
<p>I thought designing web sites with such limited content and guided
<br>
interaction could be a great way to spread particular idea. People
<br>
could say : &quot;you know what nanotech is ? no ? well have a look at that
<br>
address&quot; ; and instead of finding there a whole book or series of
<br>
article, there would be limited content and a guided interaction with
<br>
a beginning and an end, taking the user by the hand, a conveying a
<br>
simple but accurate version of the ideas.
<br>
<p>You could even have a (private) institution that becomes well-known
<br>
for providing useful popular simple-but-accurate presentations of
<br>
concept, that could be referred by people in democracies. Think
<br>
&quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; for example.
<br>
<p>Why the hell don't political parties do that ? (Or maybe they do ?)
<br>
<p>In Switzerland, they have a direct democracy as you know, which means
<br>
people vote very often on very many things. Before each voting day,
<br>
citizens receive a booklet with a description of each topic to be
<br>
voted on, with a presentation made by the gov., but also a
<br>
presentation made by political parties defending opposite viewpoints.
<br>
It is not too long, and every &quot;good citizen&quot; is supposed to take some
<br>
time to read it and make up his mind, before to cast his vote.

<em>&gt; I was wondering when someone would notice this...half expected to see some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of you guys on it...The UK media does this: it chucks things at people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In at the deep end, a little like the style of 'Great Mambo Chicken' did way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back whenever. Be assured the program isn't aimed at kids...it's aimed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average British person's knowledge of science...and more. It's going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause as many endless debates as GM food did last year. But with one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential difference...this programme comes out apparently firmly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive side of new tech. And, as you say, at least some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'spokespersons' know what they're on about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The debates are going to be heated and over the top for about six months,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after which things will settle into the traditional British habit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'people-getting-bored-with-it-all-and-they-don't-really-understand-it-anyway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -so-who-cares?' Meaning, simply, that people on the whole will forget about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it all again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But which is the best tactic here? -Any publicity is good publicity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or -stay out of the news; stay out of trouble?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What thinkest thou?

<em>&gt; Subject: MEDIA, UK: how to build a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the BBC website, there's a section dedicated to the TV program &quot;How to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; build a human&quot;, mentioned in previous messages as having a borderline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanist attitute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; URL(<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/genes/court_of_opinion/index.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/genes/court_of_opinion/index.shtml</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can debate the pros and cons of immortality, listen to the experts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (watch out for Nick Bostrom) and vote. When I had a look, the ratio was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about 70:30 between those that would like to live forever (various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and those that wouldn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The graphics of the site make it look like its targeted at kids (unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tv program) and you won't find much that you don't already know, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pleasant surprise to find an all-out transhumanist in the experts' panel!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At this link (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/genes/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/genes/</a>) you can find out more about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
