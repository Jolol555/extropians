<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like Mr. Jones said, a market-based solution is a favorable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one, but letting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people set the value of their time does not sound like a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation, as there is absolutely no motivation to set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your time at what it &quot;really&quot; is. If I can do more by setting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my time's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value to &quot;high,&quot; why would I opt to sit at a traffic light? I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do really like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea of prioritizing the traffic light system, though.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Because the value you set corresponds to $$$. It actually costs you more
<br>
money to raise your priority.
