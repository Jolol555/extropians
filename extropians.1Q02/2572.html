To play devil's advocate: it might not be that the magic is affecting the 
<br>
street light mechanism, but instead the time at which you arrive at the 
<br>
street light.  If your magic is affecting all sorts of subtle things about 
<br>
the way you and the people around you react, it could reasonably change 
<br>
your schedule enough that you always happen to arrive when the light was 
<br>
going to turn green anyway.  Of course, this would be a scientifically 
<br>
testable phenomenon, and you could definitely arrange some pretty easy 
<br>
experiments, even without the subject being aware of it (since that might 
<br>
interfere...somehow).  
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I happen to have my own very powerful magick which changes red lights to green.  I certainly will not promise it works right away, but if you do it LONG ENOUGH, it is practically guaranteed to work!! 
<br>
<p>&quot;Dang, this light dared to turn red on me!!&quot;  
<br>
&quot;I'm in a big hurry here!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Damn!!!&quot;
<br>
*powerful magickal chant begins*
<br>
&quot;Turn Red!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Turn Red!!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Please turn Red!&quot;
<br>
&quot;I said TURN RED!!!&quot;
<br>
I order you to turn Red!!!!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Please turn Red!!&quot; 
<br>
&quot;Please, puh-leeez turn Red!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;#**#!!!#*! Red light, CHANGE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
<br>
<p>*Repeat this part of the magickal spell as many times as needed!^
<br>
<p>*rest mind to greatly increase magickal power*
<br>
<p>Next:
<br>
&quot;Just please let me get out of here!&quot;
<br>
&quot;C'mon!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;C'mon!!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;C'mon!!!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;C'mon!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
<br>
C'MON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;ALRIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Finally!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Whew!!&quot;
<br>
<p>Just memorize the script I have provided, and you will be ready to cast a very powerful magick spell which can help you during those frustrating moments caused by red lights!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
