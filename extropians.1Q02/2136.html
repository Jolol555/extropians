<p>What I mean is that you *may* be able to say:
<br>
<p>&quot;Evolution predicts that there should be an equilibrium between mutation
<br>
rate ensuring sufficient mutation among a group of offspring that some
<br>
will be able to adapt to environmental changes, and mutation prevention to
<br>
maximize the overall health of those offspring.&quot;  It would be pushing it,
<br>
but you might be able to prove it.  It's been demonstrated to be true at
<br>
least once, for the special case of the immune system, where the locks
<br>
have to change every generation.
<br>
<p>But you can't say &quot;maximum variation for potential evolution&quot; or &quot;adequate
<br>
health of the population&quot; without inherently postulating group selection,
<br>
and postulating group selection is almost always a mistake.
<br>
<p><p><p>### Mutation rate is one of the physiological parameters which evolve, just
<br>
like body temperature, or serum osmolality, in response to a large number of
<br>
influences. Some of these parameters act primarily on the individual level.
<br>
For example, the tradeoff between the amount of resources invested into DNA
<br>
proofreading vs. other functions (e.g. maintenance of large stores of
<br>
glycogen in the liver) has effects on short-term survival (enhanced by a lot
<br>
of glycogen for running) vs. long-term individual survival (enhanced by low
<br>
mutation rate). So, group selection is not necessary to produce a setpoint
<br>
for mutation rate (this is what you wanted to say, but then as far as I
<br>
understand it, Alden didn't imply the necessity of group selection, either).
<br>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, there are some processes acting on whole populations
<br>
- for example, during trypanosomal infection, there is a cyclic interaction
<br>
between the host immune system, which produces antibodies to the parasite's
<br>
coat proteins, and the generation of new coat epitopes by a hypermutation
<br>
mechanism. While turning this mechanism down in a particular individual
<br>
parasite isn't likely to impact its survival in the short run (2-3 weeks,
<br>
during which it can freely proliferate and even outcompete the hypermutable
<br>
ones, if only by chance), once the full immune response is on, the whole
<br>
population of the low-mutation parasites is wiped out, and only the
<br>
offspring of the few mutated ones survive. So, in the longer run, the
<br>
parasites are maintained at a (presumably) optimal mutation rate.
<br>
<p>Then there are processes involving social groups of animals (such as
<br>
wolfpacks, human hunter-gatherer groups), where social cohesion and the
<br>
behaviors necessary to maintain it have a huge impact on survival of all the
<br>
members of the social unit - should it split into inappropriately small
<br>
groups as a result of intragroup aggression (a group-related event), all of
<br>
the individuals will suffer. (This example doesn't relate to the regulation
<br>
of mutation rate but it does support group selection).
<br>
<p>More at <a href="http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/60/">http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/60/</a>. It appears that
<br>
the theory of group selection is having a comeback.
