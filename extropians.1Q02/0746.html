<p>Actually you said,
<br>
<p>: Then clearly the intelligence enhancement was a failure, give Greg
<br>
: Burch or one of his associates a call.
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>: Like I said if he goes in for intelligence enhancement and comes
<br>
: out socialist, sue the doctor.
<br>
<p>So it seems that you reject the premise of the thought experiment.
<br>
You think it is impossible that a more intelligent person could be
<br>
a socialist.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But you also were making a claim, which you even tried to defend,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually I said,
<br>
<p>: It's not implausible: in
<br>
: fact in many of the most difficult and esoteric branches of science and
<br>
: mathematics, branches which require the highest levels of sheer abstract
<br>
: intelligence to thrive, Socialism and allied political philosophies
<br>
: are widespread.
<br>
<p>I said that the thought experiment was &quot;not implausible&quot;, in an attempt
<br>
to forestall the very objection that you raised, which was that it was
<br>
impossible.  I am certainly not saying what you attribute to me, &quot;that
<br>
the smarter you are the more likely you are to believe in socialism.&quot;
<br>
I was just trying to get past your knee jerk reaction in order to get
<br>
you to take the thought experiment seriously.
<br>
<p>Obviously I failed.  Your ideology has successfully defended itself by
<br>
keeping you from seriously considering alternatives.  I congratulate it.
<br>
It rides you masterfully.  I hope the bit is comfortable in your mouth.
