I saw Robot Wars the other day, for the first time... it's just come down
<br>
from the rarified air of pay-tv, into grubby-masses-vision, so I now I get
<br>
to watch :-)
<br>
<p>I'd had some programmer types tell me how great it was, and non-techies had
<br>
quoted reviews to me about how truly lame it was. I began watching with some
<br>
trepidation...
<br>
<p>It's fantastic! Just like sport, but it doesn't suck. It blew me away. It
<br>
has just the right mixture of cool technology, bashing (including flames,
<br>
choppy things, bashy things, etc), very silly wwf style format, and totally
<br>
emotionally engrossed teams (who look devastated when their robots are
<br>
destroyed). 
<br>
<p>Wow.
<br>
<p>I had two criticisms. First, I'd like to see it played a bit straighter. I'd
<br>
like to see more league tables, lists of scores, and more battles per show.
<br>
If the presenters would take it a bit more seriously, that would be good.
<br>
Second, I would love to see autonomous robots as detailed below by Spike,
<br>
rather than glorified radio controlled cars. 
<br>
<p>What are the rules on their weapons, btw? They don't seem to be allowed
<br>
projectile weapons or explosives. What about, say, whacking an opponent with
<br>
a pointy axe thing which is hollow, then pumping that opponent full of
<br>
water, or some conductive foam or some such? Or maybe conductive dust - iron
<br>
filings? Carbon fillaments? Something like that? Or something which
<br>
dissolves cable shielding?

<em>&gt; Keep watching this robot wars.  We are right on the edge of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something an order of magnitude more interesting and worrisome:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a version of robot wars where the battlebots must be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autonomous, preprogrammed to attack and defend.  When they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start getting good at that, perhaps we could make the game so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is some meta-goal, such as having each bot gather randomly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scattered stones into a goal box.  The others try to stop that while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling their own goal boxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps bots would learn to form temporary alliances, smash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other guy, rob each other's goal boxes, etc, then fight among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.  Pretty soon they might start acting not so different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are on the verge of making up sports that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way more entertaining than watching 22 overpaid galoots
</em><br>
