</em><br>
<p>I am glad that you had such a choice when you installed it.  I have no
<br>
objection to this.  However, what you seem to have missed is that this
<br>
software is bundled with other products and gets installed without
<br>
permission.  Most people don't know it is being installed, and they never
<br>
requested it.  They just suddenly find these unsolicited links popping up in
<br>
menus on their browser.  They don't know why they are there, where they are
<br>
coming from, or how to get rid of them.  I pointed to this particular site
<br>
because they had a script to detect if the software was present on your
<br>
machine, as an aid for people who don't know what is going on.  I have no
<br>
objection to you using the software if you desire this type of behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nor does it hijack links or direct children to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; porn sites (I noticed you choose not to respond to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that part of my complaint with the &quot;Scumware&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; website!).
</em><br>
<p>You don't consider it hijacking because you chose this behavior.  Imagine if
<br>
you didn't want this, but still found it installed on your computer without
<br>
permission.
<br>
<p>As for the porn, this is a well-known problem with search engines.  Porn
<br>
sites often list lots of keywords on their site to get any search engines to
<br>
list them.  Searches often bring up porn sites that have nothing to do with
<br>
the search.  This is one of the annoyances of the Internet, but it is a
<br>
known annoyance.  TopText is no different than other search engines in that
<br>
it sometimes displays porn links.  Now imagine these unsolicited porn links
<br>
popping up in the link menus on your child's computer because of software
<br>
that appeared without your permission.  I think your attitude would be a
<br>
little different if you had not chosen for this software to be installed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are a security professional... at least that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is says in your sig.  I trusted you.  I went to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that website on your recommendation...  My trust is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now less than before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Save the &quot;Security Alert&quot;s for actual security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hazards.  Using it this way merely dilutes your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credibility.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry that you felt this was a waste of your time.  The security angle
<br>
for many of us is that we want to control what software runs on our
<br>
computers.  Any software that can install itself without permission or run
<br>
without our knowledge is a big security whole in our computer controls.  If
<br>
a computer can start doing things that I don't want because some outside
<br>
person decided that they wanted this on my computer, this is a classic
<br>
security risk.
