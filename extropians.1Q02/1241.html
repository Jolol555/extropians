<p>Hienlien's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;? I don't recall fully integrated
<br>
<p>units in that book. I do recall many references to the MI as
<br>
being exclusively male. In particular, the protagonist did
<br>
guard duty at &quot;bulkhead 40&quot; and ws thinking about WOMEN!
<br>
who were naval officers of which he might get a glimpse,
<br>
as opposed to his MI comrades who are all male. Female officers
<br>
did not serve in little ships because they could not accommodate
<br>
the necessary segregated facilities found on big ships.
<br>
<p>By contrast, David Weber's Honor Harrington series has
<br>
fully-integrated units at all levels and in all (Manticoran)
<br>
services, leading my daughter to dream of Annapolis until
<br>
she learned about the asthma disqualification.
