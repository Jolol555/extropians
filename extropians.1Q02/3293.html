<p>
I have been wondering why so many of the world's most powerful religions 
<br>
seem to have been born around the same time. It seems to me that many of 
<br>
the big religions got much of their power from the birth of writing.
<br>
<p>There would have been a special awe for written works back then when the 
<br>
technology was still new. We tend to overlook this in our world where 
<br>
written knowledge is commonplace. In those days the idea that knowledge 
<br>
could be passed on without a human carrying it would have seemed magical. 
<br>
Up until then all knowledge required a live human to pass it on. Suddenly 
<br>
these magic symbols can carry the thoughts and knowledge of dead or distant 
<br>
people! It would have seemed especially magical to those who couldn't read.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately that awe for symbols has stayed attached to some of those 
<br>
early books that represented themselves as divine or magical. People who 
<br>
are gullible enough to accept the religion meme without question -- on 
<br>
faith -- anachronistically revere what was once revolutionary technology.
<br>
<p>Ironic.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
