<p>Indeed, as I have argued before, there are many unanswered questions about
<br>
extropy. There is, for example, no straightforward way of analyzing it in
<br>
terms of the 2nd law of thermodynamics: we do not always value complexity
<br>
over simplicity, e.g., I don't think we value Mozart's music more than his
<br>
contemporaries because it is more informationally dense, indeed, perhaps the
<br>
opposite in some cases. Is it a simple or complex property? If complex, what
<br>
is it a composite of? Is it to be analyzed in terms some simpler property?
<br>
Sometimes I see 'growth' mentioned in this connection. Growth to what end?
<br>
Growth for its own sake? Does this make fat people and cancers more
<br>
extropic? If extropy cannot be compared across individuals then is the most
<br>
extropic universe one which maximizes the number of extropic individuals in
<br>
it? Of course one might think that such a crowded universe would curtail the
<br>
extropy of all the individuals, but how would we know? We said that we
<br>
cannot make qualitative comparisons across individuals. How do we know that
<br>
extropy attaches to individuals rather than say parts of individuals: who
<br>
knows maybe I have extropic arms and entropic legs; oh look she has an
<br>
extropic ass. Perhaps extropy is a property that attaches to superindividual
<br>
entities: are there extropic couples, or families, or societies, or states?
<br>
Does 'extropy' mean something like the pursuit of excellence in terms of
<br>
living a good life: attempting to maximize the excellence of my physical,
<br>
mental, and emotional characteristics? If so, isn't extropianism simply
<br>
perfectionism in thermodynamic drag?
