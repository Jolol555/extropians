<em>&gt; &quot;When a woman has an interest for science, it is most often the sign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that her sexuality is troubled.&quot; [my translation]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you agree with that ? :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jacques
</em><br>
<p>Nietzsche never did find a woman to marry. And that was
<br>
a big problem. There is generally a touch of irony in Nietzsche's
<br>
references to women, but it would be altogether a delusion
<br>
to suppose him inimical to the 'weaker sex.' It is against
<br>
the modern tendency to sex equality, sex similarity that he
<br>
raises his voice.
<br>
<p>During 1877 he writes to Malwida von Meysenbug:
<br>
'I still have the pleasant task of finding me a wife before Fall.'
<br>
Five years later, in a letter dated March 21, 1882 to his friend
<br>
Paul Rée, Nietzsche has changed his view on marriage.
<br>
No longer was it to be the fulfillment of his life's desires.:
<br>
'Do greet that Russian girl for me, if you see any sense in it:
<br>
I have a passion for this kind of soul. So much so, that I shall
<br>
very soon go on the prowl for one. Considering what I intend
<br>
to do in the next ten years, it's essential. Marriage is an entirely
<br>
different story; I could agree to two years of it at most, and even
<br>
this much only in view of what I have to do in the next ten years.'
<br>
The 'Russian girl' Nietzsche was referring to was Louise (Lou) Salomé.
<br>
Described as a 'blue-eyed blonde with the classic Roman features'
<br>
<p>Quotes
<br>
- Woman was God's second mistake
<br>
- When marrying one should ask oneself
<br>
this question: Do you believe that you will
<br>
be able to converse well with this woman
<br>
into your old age?
<br>
- Ah, women. They make the highs higher
<br>
and the laws more frequent.
<br>
- Two different things wanteth the true man:
<br>
danger and diversion. Therefore wanteth he woman,
<br>
as the most dangerous plaything.
<br>
- Too sweet fruits--these the warrior liketh not.
<br>
Therefore liketh he woman;--bitter is even the
<br>
sweetest woman.
<br>
- In the true man there is a child hidden; it wanteth to play.
<br>
Up then, ye women, and discover the child in man.
<br>
- 'Many fine things hath Zarathustra said. Strange!
<br>
Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet he
<br>
is right about them.'
<br>
- 'Give me, woman, thy little truth!' said I. And thus spake
<br>
the old woman: 'Thou goest to women? Forget not thy whip!'
<br>
<p>But also
<br>
- There cannot be a God because if there
<br>
were one, I could not believe that I was
<br>
not He.
<br>
- We should call every truth false which
<br>
was not accompanied by at least one
<br>
laugh.
<br>
<p>And the extropic quotes
<br>
- Once spirit was God, then it became
<br>
man, and now it is even becoming mob.
<br>
- The future influences the present
<br>
just as much as the past.
<br>
- You must have chaos within you to
<br>
give birth to a dancing star.
