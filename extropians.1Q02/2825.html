<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; A couple of years ago, Foresight essentially declared victory in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war for acceptance of nanotechnology.  There were conferences held every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year, one or more respected journals, government funding was ramping up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; articles in business journals.  By all accounts it was now an accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But maybe that was premature.  We are seeing a backlash, a rearguard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting action against the original vision of nanotech.  Opponents are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to build a firewall against Drexlerian mechanosynthesis, drawing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction between their prosaic nanotech and Drexler's far-out visions.
</em><br>
<p>A very good point. I think partly this is because a lot of the
<br>
researchers and institutions working under the nanotech
<br>
banner moved in there as the field became &quot;sexy&quot; and well funded. They
<br>
have no real ties to Drexler's ideas, and are mostly interested in
<br>
pursuing their own research interests. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Foresight needs to go back to its roots and shore up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundations.  It's not enough to have &quot;nanotechnology&quot; initiatives showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up everywhere.  Few of those efforts are making significant progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards Drexler's machine-based models.  Foresight needs to remind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people that there is more to nanotech than making ultra-fine powders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for smoother paint.  We have to keep our eye on the prize, a technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can utterly revolutionize every aspect of the world.  If research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not moving us towards that goal, it should not receive funding under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech grants, even if it happens to involve little tiny pieces.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a good example of why no field - be it nanotechnology or
<br>
transhumanism - seeking dramatic results in the long run, can afford not
<br>
to constantly work on its foundations and visions, show that they are
<br>
not just relevant but actually important to guide action.
