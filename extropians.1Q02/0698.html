<p>I'm no astrophysicist either,...but consider.  Earth
<br>
has an iron core.  The asteroid belt has asteroids
<br>
that are largely iron. 
<br>
<p>Iron is abundant in the solar system. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Venus has a rocky crust, a thick basaltic rock mantle
<br>
and a nickel-iron core.&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/venus/venusinside.shtml">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/venus/venusinside.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>Referring to Mars: &quot;The core is probably iron and
<br>
sulphides and may have a radius
<br>
of 800-1,500 miles&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/mars/">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/mars/</a>
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Jupiter is a gaseous planet; it does not have a      
<br>
solid surface like the Earth does (but probably has a
<br>
solid, rocky core 10 to 15 times the mass of the
<br>
Earth).&quot;  What portion of that might be iron?
<br>
<a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/jupiter/jupiterinside.shtml">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/jupiter/jupiterinside.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>Regarding Saturn, &quot;The hot, heavy, rocky core has a
<br>
radius possibly three times the radius of the Earth.&quot;
<br>
Again, how much of that might be iron?
<br>
<a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/saturn/saturninside.shtml">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/saturn/saturninside.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Core: Uranus has a molten rocky core about 10,500
<br>
miles (17,000 km) in diameter and about
<br>
12,500°F (6927°C). This core may have a mass five
<br>
times greater than the mass of the Earth.&quot; 
<br>
<a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/uranus/uranusinside.shtml">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/uranus/uranusinside.shtml</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>By whatever method, supernova remnant or &quot;condensed&quot;
<br>
from the presolar nebula with--presumably--a
<br>
substantial iron component, the sun probably has a
<br>
substantial quantity of iron. Judging from the other
<br>
bodies in the solar system, would it be unreasonable
<br>
to suppose that iron and other &quot;heavy&quot; elements would
<br>
concentrate, ie sink, to the sun's core?
<br>
<p>Iron constitutes 0.16% by &quot;weight&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/vitalstats.html">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/vitalstats.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;of the sun's photosphere. If that fraction were
<br>
uniform throughout the sun--as opposed to a core
<br>
composed of a substantially larger fraction of dense,
<br>
highly-ionized, heavy elements (heavier than
<br>
helium!)--then the amount of iron in the sun would
<br>
equal 533 earth masses.
<br>
<p>Regarding a cooling/collapse problem resulting from an
<br>
iron core, or a core with a substantial iron fraction:
<br>
it is currently accepted that iron lies at the energy
<br>
minimum for nuclear binding energy based on nucleon
<br>
number. Thus, as Anders states, moving away from the
<br>
energy minimum by transmuting iron into either heavier
<br>
or lighter elements would be an energy absorbing
<br>
process.  However, as an alternative, might not this
<br>
process tend toward a steady reversibilty, with an
<br>
equilibrium condition established where there was no
<br>
ongoing loss of energy to nucleosynthesis?  Wouldn't
<br>
it likely be the case that the energy would not be
<br>
systematically lost, but only stored temporarily in
<br>
elements with a distribution of nucleon numbers
<br>
centered around iron, and a correlated distribution of
<br>
binding energies?  
<br>
<p>Wouldn't the current empirical evidence of a stable
<br>
sun  suggest just such a condition of stable
<br>
equilibrium, with equal numbers of nuclei transmuting
<br>
away from and then back to iron?  I base this
<br>
supposition on the (thermodynamic?) principle that all
<br>
systems tend toward their energy minimums.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------
<br>
<p>The question of the putative iron core of the sun was
<br>
a lot of fun to mull over.  
<br>
<p>I recently had to reformulate my mental picture of the
<br>
solar system.  List discussion of comets, and Amara's
<br>
&quot;spotlight on dust in the solar system&quot;,  forced me to
<br>
enlarge the model--out to the furthest reaches of the
<br>
oort cloud-- and throw a substantial quantity of
<br>
&quot;dirt&quot;--gas, dust, and cometary debris--into the once
<br>
tidy familiarity of brilliant star and orderly planets
<br>
(and semi-disorderly asteriods). 
<br>
<p>Now, it seems I have to do the same with the sun, and
<br>
dump a couple of thousand earth masses of &quot;debris&quot;
<br>
into the mix.  Makes perfect sense to me that the sun
<br>
should have a &quot;core&quot;.  Makes the sun an infinitely
<br>
more complex system.  Gives it &quot;character&quot;.  Next time
<br>
I find myself, of an evening, North of Half Moon Bay,
<br>
walking with my dog--worthless piece of fur; prime
<br>
candidate for a vietnamese entree--along the bluffs
<br>
above the ocean, and I pause to watch the glowing
<br>
spaceship end its daily sojourn and slip gracefully
<br>
beyond the mist-shrouded ends of the earth, I'll stop
<br>
for a moment, perk up, dance a little dance to
<br>
celebrate the magnificence of life, and think to
<br>
myself, &quot;It's got a core.  A big honkin' system
<br>
complexifying core.&quot;  And my dog will look up at me
<br>
and think,&quot;What the hell's gotten into him THIS time?
<br>
<p>I be happy.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
