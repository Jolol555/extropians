Looks like freezing techniques are gradually improving. Alcor might be in
<br>
with a chance yet!

Organ transplant breakthrough
<br>
<p>Embryos successfully conceived from the frozen ovaries.
<br>
&quot;We have demonstrated that whole organ transplantation is feasible&quot;.
<br>
Professor Roger Gosden.
<br>
<p>Scientists have successfully frozen whole organs without destroying their
<br>
function. The breakthrough raises the possibility that doctors will
<br>
eventually be able to keep donor organs in deep freeze until they are needed
<br>
for transplant operations. It might also allow women who have to undergo
<br>
cancer treatment to store healthy organs, and have children when they would
<br>
otherwise have been infertile.
<br>
<p>Scientists have previously been able to store and freeze tissue samples. But
<br>
until now it has not proved possible to freeze and store whole organs
<br>
because the freezing and thawing process does too much damage.
<br>
<p>The researchers carried out their research on rats. They removed and stored
<br>
the creatures' ovaries in liquid nitrogen, then successfully transplanted
<br>
them into rats that were genetically identical. Although the transplanted
<br>
ovaries were less efficient after freezing, more than half ovulated normally
<br>
and one recipient became pregnant.
<br>
<p>Lead researcher Professor Roger Gosden, of the Eastern Virginia Medical
<br>
School, US, said that if the technique could one day be applied to humans,
<br>
it would offer an option to women and children who would otherwise be
<br>
sterilized by chemotherapy. It might also be used to reduce the risk of
<br>
premature sterility in women with other medical conditions.
<br>
<p>Advances in freezing techniques could also make it possible to store and
<br>
successfully transplant other organs. At present, freezing tends to cause
<br>
irreparable damage to the blood vessels.
<br>
<p>Professor Gosden told BBC News Online: &quot;The take-home message is that we
<br>
have demonstrated that whole organ transplantation is feasible. The frozen
<br>
ones were not all successful, but that is not surprising because 50 years
<br>
after the first successful sperm freezing results are still not perfect.&quot;
<br>
<p>Professor Gosden said it would be more difficult to freeze human organs
<br>
successfully because they were larger. However, the blood vessels, being
<br>
larger, would potentially present less problems during surgery.
<br>
<p>The research is published in the magazine Nature.
