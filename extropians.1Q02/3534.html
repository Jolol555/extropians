<p>No, but there's a limit to how far I'll go to try to read
<br>
something. I'll look up a word I don't know in a dictionary, but I
<br>
won't google for it and attempt to deduce its meaning from the
<br>
context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Is it just me, or is this guy writing to impress people with his

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not so fast. I *did* attempt to find out what his &quot;technical&quot;
<br>
terminology meant. I failed. I decided, based on what I *could*
<br>
understand, that it wasn't worth the effort to track down those two
<br>
words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The final comment about trying to `seem &quot;intellectual&quot;' is unworthy of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, unless you think `intellectual' is a term of abuse (`Ya ya, he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading, ya ya, he's *thinking*, let's pelt the creep with stones and tear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up his book!') or, more likely, you are claiming that he must be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *feigning* his intellectual culture. That would be a more compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument if you'd taken the trouble to find out what he was saying, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countering it with a reasoned retort.
</em><br>
<p>I used &quot;intellectual&quot; to refer to the kind of pseudo-intellectuals who
<br>
write bloviated, obfuscated pieces in an apparent attempt to impress
<br>
themselves and other pseudo-intellectuals.
<br>
<p>I've just taken a few minutes to google Bey, and everything I've read
<br>
confirms my initial evaluation. I think Bey is someone's idea of a
<br>
joke. He's a version of Emacs' doctor-mode that strings pretentious
<br>
words together into meaningless but impressive-looking grammatically
<br>
correct sentences.
<br>
<p>Or maybe he's the emporer's new clothes, and everyone is afraid to
<br>
notice the nudity.
<br>
<p>If he's real and he's got anything worthwhile to say, he hides it
<br>
well.
