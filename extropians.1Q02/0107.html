<em>&gt;&gt; previous US involvement in Afghanistan has certainly contributed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; current undesirable situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree, because previous US involvement in Afghanistan has helped to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expose the terrorists, who would otherwise have remained hidden and secretly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plotting their malignant and murderous crimes.
</em><br>
<p>This is a funny use of the word 'expose'. US involvement in Afghanistan in
<br>
the 80s had three important effects (1) It provided military training to
<br>
individuals including bin Laden, who later engaged in unanticipated
<br>
terrorist actions against the US (2) It provided a very large quantity of
<br>
arms, initially to further the anti-Soviet fight, but later used locally by
<br>
the Taliban (and others) against the US (3) It deliberately fostered a local
<br>
culture of militant Islam, initially directed against the Soviet occupation.
<br>
To this extent, US foreign policy contributed to the current situation;
<br>
that's all I'm arguing here. I am not making any attributions of causality
<br>
or responsibility. 
<br>
<p>Maybe I have misunderstood you (in which case, my apologies) - in what sense
<br>
did US involvement in the 1980s lead to the terrorists being exposed?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This suggests that risk assessment was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; faulty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, the outcome of this war continues to show that it is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to destroy terrorism rather than try to appease it. The world is safer without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organized religious fanaticism such as the Taliban and Al Quaida.
</em><br>
<p>These two points are orthogonal. I agree with the current US actions in
<br>
Afghanistan. My point was that the original risk assessment in the 1980s was
<br>
faulty, in the sense that it fostered the conditions that led to the present
<br>
circumstances. Note that this doesn't in any way imply US responsibility for
<br>
terrorism, but does suggest that we should pay attention to the root causes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case, &quot;short term gain&quot; equates to trying to appease the terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Long term gain means ridding the world of terrorists.
</em><br>
<p>No, you are misrepresenting my position and may have misunderstood the point
<br>
I was making. I support the current short-term action in Afghanistan. My
<br>
point was that the *original* action by the US in the 80s appeared to have a
<br>
positive short term gain (fight the Soviet Union). But with hindsight it
<br>
turned out to have extremely negative long term implications (fostering
<br>
militant Islam). Thus actions can have unanticipated consequences; foreign
<br>
policy should therefore seek to learn from such experiences. That's all I'm
<br>
suggesting!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snipped stuff&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In case it has escaped your notice, let me point out that the President is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top Marine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The marines do *not* act independently of the government (&quot;politicians &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diplomats&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War is diplomacy carried on by other means.
</em><br>
<p>Apologies for not knowing about US military hierarchy. I think we're in
<br>
agreement here. I'm using 'military' vs 'politics' as a shorthand here for
<br>
'killing people with marines' versus 'helping set up democratic
<br>
institutions' or similar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Leaving 'why' to the next decade was dangerous in the 1980s as we can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with the luxury of hindsight;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonsense, the 80s had no equivalent act of terrorism to that of 9-11, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflate US policy in the 80s with the kind of murderous acts of the Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Al Quaida is just plain ignorant.
</em><br>
<p>(BTW, whatever happened to the 'no ad hominem attacks' policy that I was
<br>
told about when I recently joined the list?!).
<br>
<p>This is a misrepresentation of my position. I'm making a very simple point;
<br>
that the foreign policy of the US in Afghanistan in the 1980s had
<br>
unanticipated consequences. This does not imply any form of US
<br>
responsibility for thhose consequences. Nor does it imply I don't support
<br>
the current US actions (I do). However, I do believe that all of us benefit
<br>
from considering the unanticipated consequences of our actions, in order to
<br>
consider modifying our behaviour in future to prevent such undesirable
<br>
consquences occurring. That's all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Today the world is a safer place due to US action against terrorists.
</em><br>
<p>We'll see. I certainly hope so, but I am not optimistic. However I don't see
<br>
that anything else could have been done right now, given the circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If the kind of passive denial that you advocate were to prevail, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists would go on terrorizing the whole world, and by now they might even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have carried out their vow to destroy Israel. But then, perhaps that's what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you secretly want to happen.
</em><br>
<p>I'll ignore this ad hominem attack if that's all right by you.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
