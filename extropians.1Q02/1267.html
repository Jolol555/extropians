<em>&gt; Ethical Thesis: We ought to employ technology to realize this

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you leave out this end transhumanism becomes arbitrary. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be a motivator for anything else than promoting cool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toys.  Transhumanism is commonly criticized as being mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technophilia, and seeing the core of transhumanism as technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforces this. There is nothing wrong with liking technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but aren't we aiming higher than that? Saying that tech can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change us doesn't say what changes are desirable or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes and well stated.  Which is part of why I keep asking 
<br>
annoying questions like:
<br>
how do we want to change?
<br>
why do we want to, why is it important?
<br>
how many of us get to participate in this and on what basis?
<br>
what kind of world do we want to create for ourselves?
<br>
<p>The tech by itself will not provide most of the really 
<br>
interesting answers.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The central meme of socialism isn't government control, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central meme of libertarianism isn't free markets. They are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means to ends (equality and liberty, among others). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the concept &quot;the central meme of transhumanism&quot; ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be staked through the heart and buried behind an event horizon -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is too dangerous and seductive through its apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplicity, catchiness and ecumenism. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Sounds good.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I can, given my view that transhumanism is indeed based in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanism, firmly say that a nazi post (even when dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject) in a transhumanist forum is wrong in the same way:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nazism is fundamentally incompatible with transhumanism. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, one could ask exactly what you define humanism as that 
<br>
excludes Nazis so automatically.  More interestingly, it would 
<br>
be worthwhile to see how much of the &quot;baggage&quot; of humanism 
<br>
really seems all that desirable or reasonable given the 
<br>
possibility of radical transformation of humans and/or their 
<br>
eventual overshadowing by non-human sentients.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Same with an ecumenical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;transhumanist organization devoted to the furtherance of human enhancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technologies - you agree to disagree on a lot of issues (like Rifkinites and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the church when talking about reproductive medicine) but you work together
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on things you can agree on. If somebody's views are beyond the pale, you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not argue - you exclude them by fiat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a great example on why core values are important. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were sitting in the same organization as Rifkin and the Church
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and only trying to base your decisions on the view that humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can technologically enhance themselves, you would never have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments in favor of doing this other than some practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits, and they would always have firm arguments why it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unethical.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, they don't have firm arguments why it is unethical, 
<br>
only very strident ones.  If X improves life and one's ability 
<br>
to enjoy it and it harms no one then what ethical argument can 
<br>
there be against X?  Perhaps the argument that those that do not 
<br>
do X will be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, 
<br>
Y?  Then you need a way to deal with this argument, perhaps by 
<br>
making it so that those who do X are a net benefit even to those 
<br>
who do not.  Or perhaps simply by pointing out that there are 
<br>
many types of X that give a competitive advantage that it would 
<br>
be silly and pernicious to make illegal simply because of that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Second, and I think this is a more severe problem, is that trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;appeal to a lot of people by having more diluted values or ideology will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mean that you get more people importing their own favorite ideologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;into the movement and more people who don't get understand whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;central values there are and are more into it for the community or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;networking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;### You can always have a restricted-entry organization for the special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people, and a free-entry club for the proles. The two together can achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more, without spoiling the experience for anybody (at least initially).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inner and Outer circles seldom work, since they tend to get out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sync (as well as the usual sociopsychological problems of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in-groups and out-groups, power struggles and &quot;my conspiracy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than yours&quot;). The &quot;elite&quot; may have the core values and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology, but without them the other organisation will start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drifting ideologically on its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>True but they actually have existed in most movements and 
<br>
religions throughout recorded history and they generally work 
<br>
quite well.  Since people are very different from one another in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence, dedication to a cause, understanding of the 
<br>
central aspects of that cause, what they are in it for 
<br>
personally and so on - it makes quite a bit of sense that 
<br>
various subgroups including more general outer groups versus 
<br>
more inner-circle ones will emerge.
<br>
<p>The vast majority of any movement are followers basically rather 
<br>
than originators, planners and main motivators.  I don't think 
<br>
transhumanism  will be any different.  I don't see how it can be 
<br>
until after much transformative technology is already widely in 
<br>
use, if then.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; A good example is the swedish liberal party Folkpartiet. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked, their chief ideologist gave us quite transhumanist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian answers to a number of questions. At the same time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the politicians of the party have been protecting liberty by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting bans on behaviors that may be dangerous (like going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by car without seatbelt, harsh rules against drug use and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prostitution), more regulation of the markets in the interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of equality and freedom (including the state monopoly on alcohol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sales), and supported many very restrictive laws on research in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetics. There is a total discrepancy between the &quot;inner party&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the &quot;outer party&quot; that actually does the political work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what not taking ideology seriously leads to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, this is generally what each level taking things 
<br>
seriously leads to as not all levels will have the same vision 
<br>
or consider the same things important.  This is one of the 
<br>
trickiest things about any mass organization.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, many of the ideas that were discussed were hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-lying fruits: transhumanist architecture, utility fogs, idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futures, reputation systems etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And there is plenty of important stuff this side of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity: how to shape societies, economies, institutions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal systems and careers to handle the predicted dynamic high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tech society? How to handle the problem of destruction from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicating technology? What ethical, aesthetic and cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles to promote in order to produce a transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society? How would a transhumanist society even work? - these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions have hardly been developed, new data is arriving daily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they ought to be high priority for all of us. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Hear, Hear.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Third, what use are the masses? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;### Demonstrations, marches, security, letter-writing. Don't underestimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the value of a bunch of stalwart believers, even if their thinking is not as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fine as their leadership's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having a lot of people supporting you is good if your ideas are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded as part of the serious discussion. That don't happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you have many supporters, but rather because your ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are shown to be relevant to current policies, have a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ideological impact and convince key people. *Then* the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaigns might be truly useful, but before that it is a blunt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon. Most elites regard million man marches as more relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that they show that somebody has organisational ability than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that there are a lot of people out there. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Unfortunately, in most modern democracies, you are heard largely 
<br>
on the basis of the size of your group and the size of the 
<br>
group's resources rather than on the relevance or insight of 
<br>
your ideas.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But I question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the point in having a million members in WTA or ExI if their membership
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;doesn't *mean* anything. A far more successful strategy is to create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;real world view (and a world-view is far more than a view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technology!), make the intellectuals and cultural leaders recognize it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and then watch the mainstream move in your direction. It has worked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;well in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;### Why not take both roads?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to invest effort rationally. They payoff in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual sphere is far greater than in the mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere. If I can convince one intellectual (in Hayek's sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the group of people in society that process and spread ideas),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then he will go on convincing other intellectuals and spreading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea to the masses. Intellectuals certainly listen to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masses and do pick up ideas, but usually the memeflow is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other direction. This means that the same effort in spreading an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea is likely to produce a far greater (and faster replicating)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return if I concentrate on the cultural leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I think it is increasingly evident that it is not intellectuals 
<br>
per se who shape mass ideas and political decisions much of the 
<br>
time today.  They have been supplanted by less refined 
<br>
manipulators of pressure groups and public opinion.  By far the 
<br>
vast majority of people are not swayed by intellectual arguments 
<br>
alone.  You need to capture their hearts and their guts (if you 
<br>
will) as well as their mind.  Intellectuals are not generally 
<br>
that good at that.  History is full of intellectually started 
<br>
movements that eventually became mainstream but were twisted 
<br>
into something far different than the intellectuals attempted. 
<br>
Often those same intellectuals were the first victims of their 
<br>
&quot;success&quot;.  I also don't think we have the time now to wage a 
<br>
relatively slow intellectual/teaching type of campaign.
<br>
<p>Many of the cultural leaders are not idealists.  Many are 
<br>
pragmatic individuals bought by various pressure groups and 
<br>
interests.  At the least in most developed nations you will face 
<br>
an uphill battle against established interests, many of whom 
<br>
have strong conflicts with a transhumanist worldview and its 
<br>
results.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ouch, I dislike talking about the &quot;masses&quot;. Makes me sound like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a technocrat. I *love* talking to random people! But to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximal cultural impact you have to talk to the right people. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, we do have to talk about the &quot;masses&quot; and it is important 
<br>
that transhumanism have appeal for them.  It is also important 
<br>
to recognize that the vast majority of human beings will not 
<br>
understand what you are on about at all unless you break out 
<br>
very concrete benefits/liabilities that come from it or from 
<br>
forbidding it.  Without that we will never succeed in creating a 
<br>
mass movement.  An alternative is to sell the intellectuals on 
<br>
the full goals and the masses primarily on the necessary amount 
<br>
of freedom to keep the Singularity humming right along rather 
<br>
than trying to sell them some of the most interesting 
<br>
possibilities and results outright.  I think there is a place 
<br>
for both.
