In my ignorance, I wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Isn't there usually a hardware timer inside the things that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;switches from red to green and back at pre-set intervals? 
</em><br>
<p>A bit of googling to baby-talk sites assures me that many busy city streets
<br>
do indeed use hard-wired timers. Nowhere there for magick or psi to weave
<br>
its spell, I assume.
<br>
<p>But there are plenty of other cute gadgets: induction coils set in the
<br>
pavement near the intersection, waiting for a heavy steel vehicle body to
<br>
sit over them and close an induction loop. If you didn't know it was there,
<br>
the lights would seem to change by... wow... *magic*. And there are
<br>
variants: rubber hoses with air, squeezed by the weight of the vehicle;
<br>
laser beams; digital cameras... Not many of those are vulnerable, you'd
<br>
suppose, to magickal interventions, although their routine functioning
<br>
might make a cave man (or me, dope that I am on a bicycle) think there was
<br>
something awfully animist and car-besotted about this street corner...
