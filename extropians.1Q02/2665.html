Greetings !!!!!!!!!! *huge grin*
<br>
<p>I cannot translate... Which changes nothing to the fact that people like
<br>
seeing faces/stuff in smoke, clouds, tea leaves, or dried sea shells (my
<br>
Senegalese grandma does weird stuff with those sea shells). There's another
<br>
pic on da net showing what looks like an evil face in the clouds of smoke
<br>
spiraling up in the sky above the twin towers. My question is:
<br>
What's the point of caring about UFOs if we have no proof ? Before you start
<br>
about 'proof', this is what I mean:
<br>
standing next to an active volcano, nobody would feel too confident about
<br>
not getting burned by hot lava. You'll never hear someone (unless they're
<br>
into tea leaves, LSD what have you... yeah, just kidding) doubt that
<br>
standing next to an active volcano is dangerous. Volcanoes have been
<br>
observed, studied, are still being observed and studied... It has been
<br>
proved that lava burns...I used to love 'anything' even vaguely
<br>
mystical/paranormal as a teen... I gave up when I realized what I could do
<br>
with the 'normal' *laughing*
<br>
<p>*Arona after a nice dinner and a glass of red wine, feeling quite
<br>
'ooooooooooooooooh' coz he's not really a drinker and is
<br>
quitting everything: cigarettes + THC (cannabis) + MDMA.... Yeah... 8 years
<br>
of Cannabis, 15 years of cigarettes, 6 years of MDMA (Xtacee / Ecstasy or
<br>
however it's spelled nowadays)... Feel like a bull... I could probably
<br>
headbutt a bull right now hehehe*
<br>
<p>PS: I, for one, find it hard to believe that 'anyone' could even think of
<br>
aliens/UFOs in this case. I mean for Arona's sakes: thousands died...Can't
<br>
we at least think about it rationally ? Why involve UFOs etc ??? It would
<br>
even be easier to believe that both towers were blown by Americans in order
<br>
to get certain laws passed ( I almost do sometimes ). But UFOs ???
<br>
Puh-lease.
<br>
<p>PS2: Anyone knows how to assemble/disassemble an Hitachi hard disk : model
<br>
DK23AA-12 ? Even pics would do... Mine died or is playing dead... Can't
<br>
code... using my wife/girlfriend's PC (for email) which runs Windows
<br>
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh... *misses his Debian distro*
<br>
<p><p>*waves to each and everyone*
