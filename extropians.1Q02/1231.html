</em><br>
<em>&gt; people can marry anyone at all without having the marriage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nullified on some bogus grounds at some arbitrary future time.
</em><br>
<p>Let me say this one more time: all people have an equal right to marry
<br>
someone of the opposite sex. There is NO discrimination in this at all.
<br>
Gays and lesbians, transgendered and bisexuals all have the same right
<br>
to marry someone of the opposite sex that heteros do.
<br>
<p>If you are going to invent a NEW right, to redefine the definition of
<br>
marriage, that is your business, but do not do so from an equal
<br>
protection standpoint. 
<br>
<p>The purpose of marriage is NOT about joining forever with the one you
<br>
love. Marriage, throughout history, has been a specific social contract
<br>
used for the purposes of providing specific economic and social
<br>
protections for the production of children. The fact that two people
<br>
that love each other tend to join in marriage as a symbol of that is
<br>
irrelevant, as that is not the purpose. While love is quite beneficial
<br>
to a stable marriage, it has only become an important ingredient in the
<br>
last century or so.
<br>
<p>I entirely support the idea of redefining marriage, but lets not play
<br>
games with claiming a pre-existing right where none exists. If you are
<br>
going to redefine marriage, you still are going to wind up defining it
<br>
such that it discriminates against the desires of some segment of the
<br>
population.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that the social mores that cause people to be disgusted at
<br>
the desires of groups like NAMBLA are very similar to the ones that
<br>
create homophobia and other anti-gay sentiments, and which restricted
<br>
same sex marriages throughout history. Lets not claim that there is some
<br>
significant difference here. 
<br>
<p>I am perfectly willing to discriminate against relationships proposed by
<br>
NAMBLA, I just don't claim that there is an equal protection basis for
<br>
marriage laws, or that marriage itself bears any relation to equal
<br>
protection principles.
