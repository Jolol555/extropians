Brian Atkins stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I've been converted into a firm believer in eliminating unnecessary
<br>
risks to my long term survival. Especially relatively easy things to
<br>
do like signing up with Alcor. So yes, I am hedged&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, if cryogenics does preserve memory and personality, then you have the 
<br>
game beat.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;. The two things you are talking about are almost completely separate 
<br>
issues, and any combo Extropian/Singularitarian would have to have a very 
<br>
interesting
<br>
reason to not sign up for cryonics. No matter how soon you think the
<br>
Singularity is arriving, you still have to anticipate accidents, diseases,
<br>
etc. You'd look pretty darn silly to die irretrievably a year before the
<br>
big event.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes they wouldn't have a strong reason to sign up with Alcor, if there is a 
<br>
real chance of (a very eventual) post-mortem survival. My complaint (whine) 
<br>
is that there seems to be such a paucity of work/interest in the subject, 
<br>
that, from an Extropian point of view, it seems to be the over-worked word, 
<br>
Denial.
<br>
<p>I main that we still need an insurance policy (meme) would benefit from a 
<br>
psychological/intellectual insurance policy. If I had the deep pockets I 
<br>
would, as former Monkee, Michael Nesmith (heir to the liquid paper 
<br>
fortune-seriously) and buy an afternoon chat with some of the world's great 
<br>
brains. Ah well, so much for fantasy.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Our society (as demonstrated by the ease of the 9/11 attack) is extremely
<br>
complacent, and still very much so even now. Not only is this affecting
<br>
our security in general, but also it is a huge factor in limiting the
<br>
audience for transhumanism. No one who is content with their life and
<br>
perceived future will be very interested. Paradoxically, the benefits
<br>
that modern technology and prosperity bring to people also makes them
<br>
blind to what is missing or what can be improved.?? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No argument here, we are content lazy bastards, but it beats running out into 
<br>
the reeking streets like they do in facistan (3rd world) and howl for blood. 
<br>
We are complacent indeed.
