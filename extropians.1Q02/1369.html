<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Let's discuss this Anders.  I agree that it is probably not a good idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to discuss transhumanist in a debate regarding politics, unless you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussing the future of humanity, topic of human potential, social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cultures, etc.  If you are discussing the social fabric of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who make up any one ideological agenda, it might also be worthwhile to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mention, who are part of the business world and scientific/technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development, it might also be a good idea to discuss the people market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(snip)  As long as we have debates as the current one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where even the definition of the fundamentals is in the air, then it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hard to gain anything from mixing in the &quot;trademark&quot; of transhumanism into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the debate without being able to back it up with strong ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguments.
</em><br>
<p>If a person positions her arguments based on a clear ideological viewpoint, 
<br>
it reflects better on an &quot;ism&quot; rather than parroting an &quot;ism&quot;.   The nice 
<br>
thing about forming an ideology is that it can be personal or 
<br>
individual.  Once this is established, the mention and reference to 
<br>
formalized &quot;isms&quot; becomes a clear point of reference rather than dependency 
<br>
and give more depth and character to the individual, and in turn the 
<br>
association or organization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I?d like to know what advantages you find in the European Liberal political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;agenda.  Could you please expand on what basic principles stand out as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;aligned with a futurist agenda, especially ones which encourages and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;protects individual advancement?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think this is mostly a matter of misunderstanding. I consider myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian (my current reading is _The Machinery of Freedom_ by David
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friedman, but I think I'm a minarchist, not an anarcho-capitalist :-), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since this term is generally called liberal here in Sweden, I tend to point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the difference, which may cause extra confusion. I'm definitely not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US kind of liberal, which here in Sweden would be a rightist social democrat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(although I do have many social democrat friends, some of which regard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves as transhumanists).
</em><br>
<p>This is interesting.   Thanks for elaborating.  I consider myself &quot;in the 
<br>
process&quot;.  While I am a registered libertarian, I don't vote party ticket. 
<br>
I vote on what issues are at hand and how best to deal with them at the 
<br>
time to effectuate what I think would ultimately set policies in a 
<br>
transhumanist direction.  I'm more interested in political policies at this 
<br>
time than in that past and this is due to the bioteck/therapeutic cloning 
<br>
situation her in the  U.S.
<br>
<p>Right now, I don't think politics can do much to change the current 
<br>
situation.  What I do think is important is to focus on issues and voice 
<br>
views/opinions.  These views/opinions can be made effective by sending out 
<br>
press releases -- lots of them and very targeted.  These press release can 
<br>
say a heck of a lot more than a single vote.  And, here I'll place my best 
<br>
bet on getting a smart thought pattern going and letting it be publically 
<br>
heard from both ExI and Pro-Act.   This is my best marketing strategy for 
<br>
personally dealing with an appropriate ideology for myself and which will, 
<br>
I trust, express the ideas of transhumanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is not up to any one organization to do the work for us.  Why rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ExI? It's certainly the best thing we have available for us today and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hopefully tomorrow, but it is an organization comprised of people.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people make the organization work or not work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is true, but there is also an effect of the organization on people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Certain styles of organization or organization cultures attract different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people, and this will in turn shape the organization and its work. In the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is always up to the individuals, but if organizations can be created
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suitable for certain aims more high quality individuals can be stimulated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work together.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, ultimately people make the organization work or not work, that's why 
<br>
its so essential that the organizations we are members of truly reflect our 
<br>
views, and help to give us momentum to be passionate about our views.  It 
<br>
seems that too much emphasis is placed on trying to separate out 20th 
<br>
century politics rather than understand and bring to light the benefits of 
<br>
each political aspiration and look at each point as being transhumanist or 
<br>
not.  This is a far better to develop a 21st century ideology than relying 
<br>
on outdated models.  (I hope this sentence does not become my by-line -:))
