Friends,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the discussion of the organ
</em><br>
donation/commercialization, I've snipped a couple of
<br>
characteristic comments: 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Would it not be more extropian to encourage
<br>
trade in human organs?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Does it get us generally closer to the type of
<br>
world we wish/need  to live in?  It doesn't look much
<br>
like what my goal is.  On the one hand it is ghastly
<br>
unpleasant and subject to tons of abuse. 
<br>
If that is so then granting such trade legal status
<br>
would legalize a nightmare with serious moral and
<br>
health repurcussions.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;There are few organs which can be taken from live
<br>
bodies, and enough people die that market forces would
<br>
result in demand satisfied by dead peoples organs.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I cant see a down side to legalizing organ trade.
<br>
Your concerns sound vaguely paranoid, but are
<br>
unfortunately shared by most people-
<br>
making it unlikely that organ trade will occur in
<br>
the near future.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------
<br>
<p>It occurs to me that this entire situation, with its
<br>
powerful ethical concerns, intensity of emotion, and
<br>
fierce social focus is likely to evaporate rather
<br>
abruptly right before our eyes--become moot--, with
<br>
the availability of alternatives to salvaged human
<br>
organs.  
<br>
<p>Replacement organs from pigs--
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-02/shc-ibi022502.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-02/shc-ibi022502.php</a>
<br>
<p>could be close.  When they become available, it will
<br>
mean multiple organ systems in great abundance, with
<br>
near zero ethical problems(there'll still be some
<br>
religious conflicts and animal rights issues, but
<br>
these will pale in comparision to questions relating
<br>
to &quot;carving up the dead/poor/clones/embryos&quot;).  
<br>
<p>This will mark a first-generation solution to the
<br>
desperate-human-suffering-driven demand for
<br>
replacement organs, and will substantially reduce the
<br>
social pressure surrounding the issue--take &quot;the heat&quot;
<br>
off, as it were.  After that breakthrough, I would be
<br>
looking for extensions of this technology.  Those same
<br>
transgenic pigs might then be employed--would
<br>
immunocompatibility work both ways do you think?-- as
<br>
hosts for the growing of individual personal--ie &quot;your
<br>
own tissue&quot;-- replacement parts using stem cell
<br>
cloning techniques.
<br>
<p>Thence on to nano-organs and other surprises.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------
<br>
<p>Anyway, my point is, that I think the current
<br>
intensity of emotion obscures the imminent calm after
<br>
the storm, analogous to the radical change,
<br>
improvement, and expansion in surgical practice
<br>
brought about by the advent of anesthesia.    
<br>
<p>Fix the problem.  Enhance.  Transcend.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
