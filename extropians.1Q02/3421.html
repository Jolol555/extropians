<p><p>Does it get us generally closer to the type of world we

wish/need  to live in?  It doesn't look much like what my goal 
<br>
is.  On the one hand it is ghastly unpleasant and subject to 
<br>
tons of abuse.  On the other hand I wonder how much worse it is 
<br>
to sell all of one's hopes, dreams, ambitions, talent and 
<br>
productive time to merely eat and pay the rent while never 
<br>
claiming one's own dreams.  Selling a kidney seems almost clean 
<br>
in comparison. If a person can choose one questionable trade-off 
<br>
freely then why not the other?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; to effectively police the trade but I think the returns would be worth it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peoples selfish instincts are usually much more reliable than their

</em><br>
<p><p>Except in situations of unequal power and wealth the selfishness 
<br>
of the more powerful will, other things being equal, swam the 
<br>
self-interest of the weaker.  If people can be coerced and 
<br>
persuaded to do and go along with some of the stupid things of 
<br>
today then I find it very hard to believe that many could not be 
<br>
persuaded to part with an organ even if it was not, on 
<br>
reasonably objective analysis, in their interests.  If that is 
<br>
so then granting such trade legal status would legalize a 
<br>
nightmare with serious moral and health repurcussions.
