<p>How about a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed 20-50
<br>
million worldwide, mostly young adults. More Americans were killed than in
<br>
all the wars of the 20th century.

<br>
<p>The problem here, as the CDC point out, is that vaccine production (which is
<br>
now available) typically takes 6 months, more than the likely warning of a
<br>
pandemic. 
<br>
<p>On the optimistic side, although a pandemic on this scale would be bad it's
<br>
not likely to be an extinction event.
