<a href="mailto:Reaon@eratio.com?Subject=Re:%20Rambling%20Rant%20was%20Re:%20Its%20Over">Reaon@eratio.com</a> observed:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;More or less my own feelings on timing; be great if it happens, but it's 
<br>
not
<br>
something you can gamble on. But asking people to believe it might not
<br>
happen in time is asking people to work and think about death. Very
<br>
unpopular, those topics.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Good point, perhaps its just too difficult to deal with. My superstitious 
<br>
feeling is that perhaps it'd be a good thing for us, if we didn't put all our 
<br>
intellectual eggs in one basket. Perhaps the destiny of humankind, its 
<br>
descendents, its precursors, is to somehow. reboot the Universe. Just a bit 
<br>
of irrationality there, but I felt I needed to state it.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;More activism needed. More funding needed. More people buying into the
<br>
various useful memes needed&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, and for the scientific community to permit themselves the intellectual 
<br>
freedom to have at it. Currently, they repress each others tendencies in this 
<br>
respect.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The Singularity tomorrow thing is so much like a religion in far too many
<br>
ways. Quite likely suicide too, if enough people adhere to it. In a way it's
<br>
going to be real annoying to have them tell you &quot;I told you so&quot; after
<br>
(insert number here) years of hard work by the rest of us have brought the
<br>
Singularity about while the lazy ones lazed around just *believing*.
<br>
<p>Reason
<br>
<a href="http://www.exratio.com/">http://www.exratio.com/</a> &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Perhaps because they believe that its just around the corner, contributes to 
<br>
such fervor or enthusiasm? My dyspepsia is technological forecasts concerning 
<br>
vast changes in the human condition, have tended to err on the 
<br>
hyper-optimistic. We, as a species and individuals, do need an 'insurance 
<br>
policy,' even if we are denying that we do.
