<p>
I have read this paper a few weeks ago, after having found it as a
<br>
result of Web searches with keywords like transhumanism and politics.
<br>
I found it quite interesting at the time, in particular because it
<br>
pointed to the fact that 100% libertarian, anarcho-capitalist
<br>
positions are not the only ones compatible with core transhumanist
<br>
values.
<br>
Now I see that most of the comments that the announcement of the paper
<br>
has received on the list are very negative. I think that if the paper
<br>
contains wrong facts, of course these should be corrected. I also
<br>
agree that the paper, as the author implicitly admits, is not
<br>
&quot;objective&quot; but politically biased. The sentence &quot;The essay also
<br>
discusses the emergence of neo-Nazi and radical democratic
<br>
transhumanism&quot; is factually true: the paper does discuss it. At the
<br>
same time I agree that the word &quot;neo-Nazi&quot; in the abstract of a paper
<br>
meant to give a political overview of the transhumanist movement is
<br>
dangerous, I think it should be removed. Perhaps the text quoted above
<br>
might be changed to &quot;The essay also discusses the emergence of a wider
<br>
range of political positions associated with transhumanism, including
<br>
conventional right and left ideologies&quot;.
<br>
So I believe the some parts of the paper should be modified if its aim
<br>
is to give an objective bird view of all political beliefs held by
<br>
persons who call themselves transhumanist. At the same time I think
<br>
this paper, though maybe slanted, is interesting and has a useful
<br>
function: to remind that
<br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism, i.e. the idea that human beings should be able to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves radically through technology, does not have much intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political content
</em><br>
and thus can be accepted by persons holding a wider range of political
<br>
opinions than previously thought.
