Wow! This is beautiful... poetic. I like very much.
<br>
<p>It seems to me a nice reconciling of the conscious and non-conscious 
<br>
meanings of &quot;purpose&quot; that have spoken of here lately. I had felt they were 
<br>
totally different and was going to send a posting to that effect, but 
<br>
luckily Jacques sent this lovely post before I could.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is one simple point, which is that we were not meant, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals, to realize we are mortal, and to reflect about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Animals seek what they are made to desire, and the stream of life (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genes' purpose) goes through them that way. When one animal, to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a strong sense of self has been given, realizes that he or she was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed as instrumental to this stream of life (he is not the end --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fact, though apparently *made to survive*, he is actualy *certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to die*), a strange situation results. (in which we spent all of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history so far)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We were built for a well defined purpose (copying our genes), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;autonomy was given to us, so to speak, for seconding that purpose more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficiently ; but too much autonomy it would seem, and too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cognition, as it has now led us to reflect on that purpose and take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distance from it, and consequently to wonder what purpose we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pursue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's the origin of the Question. Not the fact that we of all things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seek to have purpose (&quot;moral reasoning&quot;) ; but the fact that we used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to act blindly according to a definite purpose, and by successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steps we woke up from this and ended up strangely free (but mortal).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you think of evolution (or the genes) as a conscious designer, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could say that he (or she) messed up, that he overlooked the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consequences of his design, and lost control of some of his robots
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(humans). It's an old story told by many traditions (but in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creator is either God -- think Satan -- or Man -- think Dr Frankenstein's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creature --, not evolution), and it turns out that, with all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support of our scientific understanding, we now realize this is actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*our* story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The question is not really linked per se with consciousness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mortality ; but that's a huge hint (that we are instrumental), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's why, though having no clue about evolution, humans started
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspecting something long ago.

To the optimist, the glass is half full.

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
