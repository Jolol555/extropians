<p>I can see some validity here.  But it's no panacea.  What's living and
<br>
thriving most optimally?  A society where people seem happy and
<br>
individuals immigrate and technology progresses but the population fails
<br>
to replace itself through breeding and a lot of the happy people turn
<br>
out to be clinically depressed?  Or a more traditionaly society which
<br>
has survived for 3000 years and co-opted invaders (ancient Egypt,
<br>
China)?  Or a rather unlibertarian society which was able to
<br>
successfully suppress dangerous technology (guns), and then when faced
<br>
with a sudden threat was able to rapidly adapt itself to meet the threat
<br>
without falling apart, and then got on the tech progress wagon itself?
<br>
(Japan.)  And how can we separate success of societies from success of
<br>
geographies?
<br>
<p>And what about a society which respected rights internally, but not
<br>
outside of itself?  Such as if the US had conquered the world after
<br>
1945.  Or if the First World in 2010 decided to deal with environmental
<br>
problems by wiping out all humans outside of their countries?  Massive
<br>
human rights violations happen in invasions, but one can easily argue
<br>
the invading society thrives.
<br>
<p>We can say totalitarianism hasn't worked well for human beings.  We can
<br>
say some degree of decentralization and markets does work well.  I think
<br>
that about sums up the solid conclusions from the evidence so far.
<br>
<p>And what works for human beings now doesn't translate into absolute
<br>
rights for any form of sentient being.  It doesn't tell us whether a
<br>
totalitarianism based on Truth Machines, or direct changing of human
<br>
nature, might work.
