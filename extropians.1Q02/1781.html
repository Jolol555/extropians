<p>Yes it does, however much or perhaps most of the information is
<br>
still in there somehow.  Wife's grandfather had an occasional lucid
<br>
day even after the disease was advanced.  He was occasionally
<br>
his old self again, oddly enough well correlated to his taking a
<br>
medication which was mostly nicotine.  He was never a smoker.
<br>
<p>That experience is one which makes me more of a cryonics
<br>
believer than I would be otherwise, and would go ahead with
<br>
cryonics even several hours after the patient expired.  Perhaps
<br>
information in the brain stays for a while, by some means we
<br>
know not.
