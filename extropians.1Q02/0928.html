<p>Hey!  I went to Harvard -- at least for a little while and my father
<br>
(who also went there) had precious little &quot;inherited wealth&quot; (he did have
<br>
a good enough job however that there weren't any scholarships (those
<br>
are reserved for the really poor smart people).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and Yale and Oxford and Melbourne University who have prime-rib education,

</em><br>
<p>Not.  Interestingly enough I actually think much of the accumulated wealth
<br>
in the endowments goes into salary competition for the accumulation of Nobel
<br>
prize winning professors.  Now I'm fairly proud of the fact that I took a
<br>
few classes from Nobel prize winners (or their equivalents in the humanities) --
<br>
in general I found them good teachers.
<br>
<p>However, in the age of the internet, I think its an opportunity that
<br>
sould become more distributed.  With more people taking classes from
<br>
the real sages in a discipline educations would have a higher quality
<br>
and a lower cost.
