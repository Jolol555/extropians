<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or just playing devil's advocate?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p>I am astounded that modern society *still* has any problem fully
<br>
accepting homosexuality.  All the arguments against it are so easily
<br>
shredded.  Consider the common ones:
<br>
<p>Objection:  Homosexuality is not natural.
<br>
<p>Answer:  Anyone who says this has not spent enough time watching
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p>Objection:  Homosexuality is against god's plan.
<br>
<p>Answer:  I have only two problems with this argument.  1.  There is
<br>
no god, and 2.  There is no plan.
<br>
<p>Objection:  The purpose of genitals is for reproduction, not pleasure.
<br>
Homosexual contact cannot fulfill this purpose.
<br>
<p>Answer:  The average person uses the genitals for reproduction once,
<br>
twice, perhaps thrice in a lifetime.  The average person uses genitals for
<br>
pleasure or entertainment of their favorite person 2000 to 10000 times in
<br>
a lifetime.  So what are they for?  Arguing that the purpose of genitals is
<br>
to
<br>
breed makes as much sense as saying the purpose of owning a car is to
<br>
change the tires.
<br>
<p>Objection:  Homosexuality just grosses me out.
<br>
<p>Answer:  So just dont do it.  No one is making you.  What's the problem?
<br>
<p>Nowthen, regarding my original contention:  I would expect rural
<br>
communities to be more tolerant toward homosexuality, but it
<br>
doesn't seem to work that way.  My notion is that the teeming
<br>
anthill of humanity we call the city has a mind-opening effect on
<br>
people.  Rocks in a tumbler polish each other.  If there are not
<br>
enough rocks, they do not polish.  Perhaps what makes rural
<br>
communities generally less tolerant is that they have not enough people.
<br>
We need more people, more ideas, more solutions, more brains,
<br>
more freedom.  spike
