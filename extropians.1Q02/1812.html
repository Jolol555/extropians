(Emlyn O'regan)
<br>
<em>&gt; Man, you guys must really hate your jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, this definition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;work&quot; is, by definition, time spent in pursuits other than what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would be one's first choice of what to do with that time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is really pretty sad. Just say someone had an idea about what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really wanted to do, hmm, like research into nanotechnology, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went out and  acquired the skills. If said person then managed to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work in that field, the work they wanted, what would you call that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employment arrangement? A paid hobby?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there's that big a problem with the text as written,
<br>
but it could be worded better: how about &quot;work is time spent
<br>
fulfilling someone else's desires&quot;.  To the extent that you might
<br>
happen to share those desires, it might be fulfilling to yours as
<br>
well, but certainly never 100%.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I personally quite enjoy being a compter geek; I have two at home
<br>
and program recreationally. But my first choice of how to spend my
<br>
time on the computer probably wouldn't be to print your cable bill--
<br>
I'd be more likely to choose something like helping Eli with his AI
<br>
or working on Wikipedia full time.  But as it happens, the city I
<br>
choose to live in has a large company with lots of money that will
<br>
give me some of it if I use my interest and skill to print cable
<br>
bills.  It's a quite enjoyable job: I get to play with fast
<br>
machines and printers the size of trucks, and I do it well.  But
<br>
I'm not going to pretend that I actually chose to spend 8 hours a
<br>
day writing software to print bills.  And even if I did somehow
<br>
get a job with SIAI or Wikipedia, I'd /still/ be doing something
<br>
whose specifics were chosen to support someone else's goals,
<br>
even though they matched mine a little more closely.
