Mr. Bishop quoted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&quot;What collectivists refuse to recognize is that it is in the self-interest 
<br>
of every businessman to have a reputation for honest
<br>
dealings and a quality product. Since the market value of a going business is 
<br>
measured by its money-making potential, reputation or
<br>
&quot;good will&quot; is as much an asset as its physical plant and equipment....&quot; [pp 
<br>
118] &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>What came immediately to mind is the love-affair of the German businessman, 
<br>
during the 3rd reich with business practices that that were both collectivist 
<br>
and based on reputation. This may have nothing to do with todays business 
<br>
mentality, or it may be a warning that human behavior is not so maleable.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&quot;Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the 
<br>
consumer. It does not build quality into goods, or accuracy
<br>
into information. Its sole &quot;contribution is to substitute force and fear for 
<br>
incentive as the &quot;protector&quot; of the consumer. The euphemisms of government 
<br>
press releases to the contrary not withstanding, the basis of regulation is 
<br>
armed force. At the bottom of
<br>
the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a 
<br>
gun...&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes. Perhaps a substitute is the (collectivist?) mobilization of the consumer 
<br>
against the production of inferior goods and services. This would require 
<br>
people purchasing such en mass, as to damage a corporation sufficiently to 
<br>
either destroy the corporation or to force change. Color me dubious, on this 
<br>
particular proposal.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Other methods may be brought to bear, as in a barroom brawl.
<br>
Thus, treating others with the modicum of respect that characterizes 
<br>
civilization is more than simply a homily to good manners.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Glorp! I disagree. The rerason is (even though I am unqualified to be an 
<br>
economist or a financial analyst) I distrust the inherent wisdom of 
<br>
corporations. When the recent downturn began, the corpration managers seems 
<br>
to have dusted off their olf business plans, on what to do for a recession. 
<br>
The 1970s and 80's answer: layoffs! Unfortunately while Motorola and Cisco 
<br>
(for example) were covering their asses, in this manner, they merely 
<br>
deepended the downturn into a recession. Collectively, these companies 
<br>
successfully disemployed so many people, that less have discretionary income 
<br>
to purchase goods and services. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, lets see if the behaviorist study gets quoted and repeated. It might 
<br>
illuminate the way forward, or it might make fantastic birdcage liner. Let us 
<br>
see.
