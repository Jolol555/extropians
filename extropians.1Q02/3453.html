<em>&gt; Here's something that may surprise those who have never seen it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nevada is one of the most scenic states in the lower 48.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put it in the top 3.  They never sell that much in their tourist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brochures, only the gambling and legal harlotry.
</em><br>
<p><p>For outdoor sportsman types, northern Nevada is frequently ranked as the top
<br>
spot in the U.S. just for the sheer concentration of outdoor activities
<br>
available.  The Reno/Tahoe area does in fact capitalize on outdoor tourism
<br>
fairly aggressively.  Within a one hour radius you can find superb examples
<br>
of just about every type of outdoor activity imaginable that doesn't require
<br>
an ocean.  The natural scenery is also pretty spectacular in that area, with
<br>
Lake Tahoe in the high Sierra, and Pyramid Lake just up the road (Pyramid
<br>
Lake being a large, kind of eerie looking desert lake with weird rock
<br>
formations which most people would recognize because it is frequently the
<br>
backdrop for car commercials and similar).  Guided hunting and fishing trips
<br>
are also big business for that region.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But Nevada has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more to offer than that, so much more.  If you ever see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of those pictures of the US from space, notice the area which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is Nevada: mountain range after mountain range, like grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ripples on a massive sea.
</em><br>
<p><p>Nevada technically has 314 mountain ranges, of which there are at least a
<br>
dozen and a half major ones, with peaks ranging from 8,000-12,000 feet on
<br>
average.  The area behind the Sierra Nevada range (i.e. Nevada for the most
<br>
part) is the active crumple zone for the subduction of the Pacific plate.  A
<br>
number of the ranges have sections that are extremely young (read: less than
<br>
1 million years old) even though they may rise several thousand feet above
<br>
the local valley floor, and this explains among other things as to why
<br>
virtually every spring below 5,000 feet is geothermally heated to some
<br>
extent or another in northern Nevada (a lot of water does come from above
<br>
5,000 feet, but that is typically snow pack stored in granite tectonic
<br>
aquifers).
<br>
<p>My personal take on this is that I *like* the fact that the boonies of
<br>
Nevada are extremely sparsely populated and visited.  The soil is excellent,
<br>
aspen and cherry forests abound, there is adequate supplies of fresh water,
<br>
the raw scenery is magnificent.  The youth and complexity of the geology
<br>
just lends to the character of the place.  Due to the collapse of the land
<br>
market there (since the Feds own too much to make the scattered private
<br>
parcels useful), land can be bought for less than $100/acre and good fertile
<br>
land with water and trees can be purchased for less than $500/acre.  A lot
<br>
of people are not aware that a large section of the agricultural business in
<br>
Nevada is providing extremely high-end vegetables to boutique and
<br>
high-priced restaurants.  Also, much of the wild game meat served in fancy
<br>
urban restaurants is hunted on huge preserves in Nevada (which has a
<br>
practically unlimited and very diverse supply of game animals due to the
<br>
relatively small number of people hunting them compared to the sheer size of
<br>
the State).  Nevada isn't a huge agricultural State, but the quality of what
<br>
they can produce in the local climates and soil (excepting range beef
<br>
perhaps) is second to none.
<br>
<p>As a point of disclosure, I am the owner of a large tract in one of the
<br>
major mountain ranges in Nevada.  I picked it up for peanuts, but in any
<br>
other State you would have paid at least $5,000/acre for it.
