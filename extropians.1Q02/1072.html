<em>&gt; &gt; I have an idea for a powered lance that is thrust forward by the blast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from a blank magnum cartridge, but restrained, so it doesn't become a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; projectile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you put a big electrical charge through it momentarily, as a bonus?
</em><br>
<p>Watching several seasons of both BattleBots (the good ones) and Robot
<br>
Wars (the wimpy ones), one learns a few basic facts about what is
<br>
effective: traction, control, ruggedness.  A weapon such as you mention
<br>
above is not much different from existing tethered-projectile weapons
<br>
(most of which are compressed-gas powered), and would suffer from the
<br>
same problems: in order to impart much impact on the other guy, the
<br>
robot has to be much heavier than the projectile so recoil won't move it
<br>
out of range (which limits the impactofthe projectile), and then has to
<br>
be sturdy enough to absorb that recoil without damaging itself.  Many of
<br>
the most destructive robots kill themselves in the attempt to dish it out.
<br>
<p>The thing that seems most lacking to me, and where I think the
<br>
greatest benefit could be achieved in current conditions, is in the
<br>
&quot;control&quot; end of things.  All of the robots are currently human-
<br>
controlled, and the skilled operators rule, but most of their skill
<br>
is wasted doing conceptually simple but complex in the details
<br>
things like moving straight, changing direction, timing attacks, etc.
<br>
It should be possible to put a lot of that skill into the hardware,
<br>
after which the operators can move upto a higher level of skill and
<br>
strategy. Computer traction control, weak-AI movement, and a good VR
<br>
interface on a simple and sturdy bot should be able to take over.
