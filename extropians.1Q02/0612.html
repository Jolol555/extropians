<em>&gt; &gt; On a similar note, you'll notice that few Japanese Americans are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; put out at having their &quot;Internment Camp Culture&quot; violated by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; release after WWII....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think you should be careful here. There is a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between the interned and the deaf, and that is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former very likely regarded their internment as something not having any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearing on their identity (unless some of them got a really serious case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Stockholm Syndrome), while the deaf - like many disabled people -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often include the property of being deaf into their self-image. So when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somebody suggests a cure it is not just an issue of getting better, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change one's identity. 
</em><br>
<p>All the more reason to abandon silly concepts like &quot;identity&quot; that
<br>
get in the way of accomplishing things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; morphological freedom is a *negative* right: we also have the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain unchanged.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone is suggesting (at least I am not) that deaf
<br>
children be forcibly upgraded. We are merely suggesting that getting
<br>
in the way of those who desire it for themselves for silly reasons
<br>
like &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;indentity&quot; is irrational and even abusive.
<br>
<p>Young children always present tricky situations in ethical
<br>
philosophy.  Clearly children can't have complete autonomy,
<br>
and parents must have /some/ power of control; but equally clearly
<br>
there are /some/ things that are abusive and beyond the prerogative
<br>
of parenting.  A parent /should/ be able to override a child's
<br>
desire with his own superior judgment if he believes the child is
<br>
being irrational (&quot;No, Timmy, you can't tattoo a swastika on your
<br>
forehead&quot;).  But it's hard to see how a desire to have a basic
<br>
personal skill that most humans have that the child doesn't is an
<br>
irrational desire, and I think a parent is obliged to defer to
<br>
the child's own preference on such matters.
