Fascinating discovery of using lighters to give vaccinations using
<br>
electroporation, this could eliminate the problem of spreading AIDS in
<br>
africa through the reuse of needles by health workers;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/articleshow.asp?catkey=-2128672765&amp;art_id=1257705605&amp;sType=1">http://www.timesofindia.com/articleshow.asp?catkey=-2128672765&amp;art_id=1257705605&amp;sType=1</a>êû<br>
<p>NEW DELHI: An Indian scientist has successfully used a domestic gas
<br>
lighter to deliver drugs into mice through their skin, and suggested the
<br>
inexpensive lighters could be a welcome alternative to the needle.
<br>
<p>Pramod Upadhyay of National Institute of Immunology says the
<br>
peizoelectric gas lighter is inexpensive and widely available and can be
<br>
used instead of a standard syringe.
<br>
<p>Upadhyay believes his technique of immunisation &quot;can influence the mass
<br>
immunisation programme and farm animal care in a big way&quot;.
<br>
<p>The skin has long been seen as a safe and effective target for
<br>
vaccination as the epidermis (outer layer of skin) has a dense network
<br>
of antigen-presenting cells. 
<br>
<p>However, the epidermis is too thin for injection because the needle
<br>
passes straight through, a report in NewsIndia magazine - nature
<br>
magazine's science and policy round up for India, said. 
<br>
<p>A technique, known as membrane electroporation, has provided a means of
<br>
transporting DNA, peptides and proteins across the skin and cell
<br>
membrane. But it requires bulky power supplies and associated electric
<br>
paraphernalia, and so was largely ignored as a route to vaccination. 
<br>
<p>Upadhayay's innovation lies in his usage of a small piezoelectric
<br>
generator as a replacement for the bulky power supplies. 
<br>
<p>&quot;At each trigger, a typical domestic gas lighter generates a voltage of
<br>
around 18 kilovolts within seconds,&quot; Upadhayay says adding this tempted
<br>
his team to study whether the voltage pulses generated by the lighter
<br>
could cause membrane electroporation.
<br>
<p>In his experiment Upadhayay immunised one group of mice with chicken
<br>
albumen by electroporation by using a standard power supply and another
<br>
group using a modified domestic gas lighter. 
<br>
<p>&quot;In both the groups identical immune responses were generated,&quot;
<br>
Upadhayay reported.
<br>
<p>But the work, supported by a grant from the department of biotechnology,
<br>
is far from finished and further trials are necessary.
