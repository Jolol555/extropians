<em>&gt; they *WANT* to.
</em><br>
<p>First, I want to say your post is excellent, thanks for sharing, I'm
<br>
glad you are still alive, and I hope you stay sober. Any time you want
<br>
to talk, feel free to email me....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with Mike Lorrey that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;the claims that drug use is a 'victimless crime' is notas black and white,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slam dunk as many legalization proponents would liketo claim. Having been in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trenches of dealing with addicts, the damage they do ALWAYS extends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond themselves as individuals&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's about where it ends for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So my only point of contention with Amara would be this: don't be deceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into thinking addiction is a victimless crime. Legally, perhaps, that may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually be the case, but the mental, emotional, &amp; financial damages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inflicted upon others can be devestating enough to qualify as victimization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other than that, I think you are totally right on in your evaluation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The FACT of the matter is that you cannot force an addict/alcoholic to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clean. Nothing in existence can keep the afflicted from that next hit or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drink or whatever EXCEPT their own free will to *choose* to stop. S/He will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require assisstance (sometimes a great deal) to carry out this choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely, but the *choice* by necessity must be freely &amp; willingly made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the addict of his/her own accord.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree with the idea that the state shouldn't be involved in
<br>
forcing the individual to get clean. I never said it should.
<br>
<p>People involved in discussions on this list are very often operating
<br>
from very different frames of reference, and as such affronts are often
<br>
taken where none is intended, and impressions are often given when none
<br>
were proffered (or inverse of what was assumed by the reader).
<br>
<p>For example, as a libertarian, I still see there being room for *some*
<br>
minimal sort of coersion of the individual by a state or competetive
<br>
power brokers/insurance providers withing a mythical libertarian world,
<br>
for example, an insurance provider selling PPL policies in an ungoverned
<br>
area will still be free to set their own premiums for the sort of
<br>
policies their customers want. If a customer can't afford the policy
<br>
they want, its just too damn bad, and they WILL have to accept what is
<br>
offered for what they can afford, no matter who competes in the market
<br>
for their business. That is still coersion.
<br>
<p>However, in the present discussion, I am NOT talking about a mythical
<br>
libertarian society, I am dealing with present day society, here and
<br>
now, and the things I would prescribe for this society are far different
<br>
than I would prescribe for a libertarian one, for the very simple reason
<br>
that a large percent of present day American (and the rest of the world,
<br>
for that matter) population are unwilling and/or incapable of living in
<br>
the sort of libertarian society many of us dream of.
<br>
<p>That being said, Vanessa is entirely right to say that the choice to get
<br>
sober has to be up to the individual addict, however, that doesn't mean
<br>
that those who are dependent upon that individual in any way should be
<br>
left in the lurch to take the loss if the individual addict isn't ready
<br>
to get sober. Whether living in todays society or in a libertarian
<br>
world, the others involved have rights too, rights which frequently are
<br>
far more important than the individual addicts 'right to choose' to stay
<br>
addicted.
<br>
<p>In this area, a properly constructed asset forfeiture regulation, either
<br>
as a government statute or merely as a performance penalty clause in an
<br>
insurance contract, would take the addicts assets in order to satisfy
<br>
the debts of the addict: to their children and spouse, to their
<br>
creditors and business associates, etc. much as a bankruptcy proceeding
<br>
seizes the individual's assets when the individual declares that they
<br>
can no longer be responsible for their debts.
<br>
<p>By choosing to remain addicted, the individual is making a de fact
<br>
declaration of abdication of responsibility of their debts to their
<br>
dependents and creditors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This stands in stark contrast to the idea posted by Mike:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Are you advocating that an addict has a greater right to get high and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;drive their kids off a cliff than their kids have to continue living?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [This is just nonsense &amp; inappropriate]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Such individuals are no longer freely acting adult citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree. They are indeed freely acting and their action is to use. Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you think they are wrong in their decision doesn't mean that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not freely making it. Not all junkies *want* to get sober &amp; my feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that if they don't want to put in the effort when given the opportunity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then they are fucking themselves. The State need not waste money or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources on people who continue to make the *choice* to use.
</em><br>
<p>Well, my whole point here, that nobody seems to be even comprehending,
<br>
is that because the drug compromises the addicts thought processes
<br>
physiologically/neurochemically, the addict may *think* they are making
<br>
their choices freely, but they are in fact making their choices subject
<br>
to the compulsions of the drug addiction, which is *exactly* like mind
<br>
control. Is the manchurian candidate freely choosing the act of
<br>
assasination they commit? LSD, for instance, IS a drug that has been
<br>
used for mind control. Expecting it to NOT act as a mind control when
<br>
used privately is really really dumb.

<em>&gt; &gt;We live in a sick, controlling society that encourages denial &gt;and a lack

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EXACTLY! In fact, accepting responsibility for ones own actions, (past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present, &amp; future) is literally the first step in treatment of addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Addicts cannot get sober without first taking full responsibility for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves &amp; their condition. That's mostly why AA &amp; NA have such monumental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success - completely voluntary, totally self-supporting, based on tolerance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; open-mindedness, &amp; absolutely free from any State or religious doctrine -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared with many state-funded programs (including prisons) that function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the sole purpose of pulling in funding (State employees need to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their jobs *somewhere).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the individual IS responsible, because they chose to take that
<br>
first dose, but responsibility and actual control while impaired are
<br>
entirely different things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Amara pointed out:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I do not find your Means acceptable. Once you tell the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that it's OK to throw someone in jail or take their property because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of some behavior that is not harming anyone else, but that you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unacceptable, then what comes next? Firing them, evicting them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;denying them credit, stripping away their civil rights, and the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;goes on without end. If a person chooses to diminish their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by using some drugs, then they have every right to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;All drug use carries a risk, and the risks are varied. As an adult,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;each makes his/her own decision as to whether to expose themself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that drug, and one measures the potential good/harm against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;own personal form of measure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even without interference from the State, an addict can manage perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well to destroy &amp; lose everything of value in life. Therefore, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rehabilitative benefits Mike cited from such losses can be preserved. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, just within the timeframe of my treatment, I have been forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drop out of school in my senior year, I was evicted from my apartment in DC,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I lost my scholarship, my partner, my job, blah blah blah. And none of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved the State - I managed to destroy my life by my own hand &amp; all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences I faced were a DIRECT result of my own decision to use. I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is immensely important because there was no scapegoat - I could NOT use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the State as the fallguy for my demise &amp; so I was forced to accept total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility for the actions, MY actions, which brought me there. I fucked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself up big time &amp; I deserved everything I got - I had it coming. For this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason, I think it is ESSENTIAL to the rehabilitation of the addict that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State NOT be involved on any level. I cannot stress this point enough. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual MUST take full &amp; total responsibility before reaping any benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from treatment.
</em><br>
<p>If the individual is free of dependents and debts, then I entirely agree
<br>
with you. I disagree, though, when it comes to dependents and debts, the
<br>
state (or your PPL provider, in a libertarian setting) does have an
<br>
interest in looking out for the interests of others who are dependent
<br>
upon you being a productive member of society.
<br>
<p>Lets look at a hypothetical situation, lets say I am driving while high
<br>
and hit another car, causing damage to not only my car, but the other
<br>
person's car and injuring them and my ex-wife and two kids who are in
<br>
the back seat of my car, but my ex-wife has  just gained full custody of
<br>
them and I've lost all parental privileges and responsibilities. I'm
<br>
unemployed and uninsured, and I say, &quot;I'm high and can't pay for the
<br>
damages anyways cause I've got no job.&quot; I do happen to own a $200,000
<br>
house outright. If the state says &quot;huh, well, we're gonna seize your
<br>
house and sell it to pay for the damage you did.&quot;
<br>
<p>Can I, the addict, STILL blame the state for taking my house? Is what
<br>
the state did WRONG?
<br>
<p>Furthermore, by seizing that last crutch in my life that was enabling my
<br>
addiction, namely having a decent place to live so I could kid myself
<br>
that I wasn't really at 'rock bottom' yet, so I &quot;wasn't ready&quot; to get
<br>
sober, didn't the state (or the insurance company, or the courts, or
<br>
whatever) help me along to decide to get sober, while protecting the
<br>
EQUAL interests of others involved?
<br>
<p>and don't say this is 'nonsense and inappropriate'. I've seen situations
<br>
like this or exactly like this in the lives of many addicts.
<br>
<p>Mike
