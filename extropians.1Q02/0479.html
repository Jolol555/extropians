One way of making libertarian ideas more common is to read, learn from
<br>
and then apply Hayek's _The Intellectuals and Socialism_. 
<br>
<p>In general, we need better visions of what a libertarian society would
<br>
entail. Not just the big abstract stuff, but everyday life. This is how
<br>
much of socialism in its various forms got so powerful: a lot of
<br>
visions and stories about how things would work in the new society.
<br>
Sure, they were wrong, but as long as we do not provide any counterpart
<br>
(ideally correct too, of course :-) libertarianism will always seem
<br>
abstract and infeasible. It is when you realize how garbage collection,
<br>
schools and apartment buildings would work in libertaria things start to
<br>
happen. 
<br>
<p>This is why having a social sim would be so useful. Even a simple, crude
<br>
analogy can carry a lot of punch - this is why the Prisoner's Dilemma is
<br>
so important (and another thing children should learn from). 
<br>
<p>In most god-sims the perspective is inherently centralist - you tend
<br>
micromanage (or at least decide) everything, and due to the limits of
<br>
game AI this is usually the only feasible alternative.
