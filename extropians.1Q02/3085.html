No, IMO.
<br>
<p>No offense, but I cite your signature here as an example of what won't
<br>
come back (much): &quot;hip&quot; titles, and certifications that are perceived to
<br>
mean more than achievements and professionalism.  (Though the tastes in
<br>
food probably won't matter.)  It's more than just trying to justify an
<br>
&quot;entymologist&quot; to a CFO of a software corporation vs. justifying an
<br>
&quot;engineer&quot;.  You have to be willing to expand (mentally, not put on
<br>
weight, though that may happen too) as part of your job description.  Be
<br>
able to talk to the customers to understand their requirements, do *all*
<br>
the implementation work yourself if need be (including learning how to
<br>
do X if you don't already know - there's certainly plenty of Web
<br>
tutorials and references for most I.T. tasks these days, though you have
<br>
to know how to find them), test, document (legendary least favorite task
<br>
among engineers), and deliver.  Coding is only one of the necessary
<br>
skills.
<br>
<p>People who can build good, reliable software are out there; they're
<br>
rather less common than people who can build good, reliable buildings,
<br>
but it's the same ballpark.  When applying for a job, remember that the
<br>
employer will be asking, &quot;Why should I hire *you* instead of these other
<br>
professionals?&quot;
<br>
<p>I speak as one who was riding at over $100k plus stock options (now
<br>
worthless) before the dotcom crash, and had to &quot;settle&quot; for a $90k
<br>
no-stock-option salaried gig with, in practice, little overtime (they
<br>
simply can't come up with enough projects to keep me that busy, at least
<br>
on average - though there are a few days when many things come up at
<br>
once, and I have to work 9 or even 10 hours).
<br>
<p>That said...one of the places I keep hearing about how I.T. has already
<br>
picked up is in biotech.  If you remember college biology (what's an
<br>
amino acid, and what do DNA, RNA, and proteins have to do with each
<br>
other?) and know Perl (a language that does well at munging the ASCII
<br>
text flatfiles that many biologists use instead of databases), I'm told
<br>
it shouldn't be too hard to find a job if you check the local biotech
<br>
companies (assuming, of course, that you live near some).  If you
<br>
don't...basic bio can be self-taught (check out what your local college
<br>
reccomends for a bio textbook, or maybe check out MIT's online bio
<br>
class reference material), as can basic Perl (assuming you already know
<br>
how to program - and if you don't know Perl, then teaching yourself Perl
<br>
as a means towards an end, in this case convincing potential employers
<br>
that you know it, is a good example of the type of job responsibilities
<br>
I'm talking about).
<br>
<p>BTW, since we're on the topic anyway - I know someone who has an opening
<br>
for a systems administrator.  It's in Mountain View, CA, and I suspect
<br>
there are a few here whose resumes might match.  Warning, though: my
<br>
interests in this matter lie squarely with them; if I don't like what I
<br>
see, I'll discard it, possibly even mostly unread.  If you're not a
<br>
Solaris and Linux guru - especially if you're one of the many MSCEs
<br>
who've applied to them and thought that said cert was better than actual
<br>
Unix experience to administer Unix machines - don't bother.
