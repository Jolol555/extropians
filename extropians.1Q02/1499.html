</em><br>
<p>Hmmm...has anyone read the book &quot;48 Laws of Power&quot; by Robert Greene?
<br>
<p>The title is dreadfull, but the book itself is fascinating.  I'm only
<br>
partway through; it is a large and dense book.  Less prescriptive than
<br>
descriptive, it illustrates what are not so much &quot;laws&quot; as general
<br>
principles that are used in the excercise of power, with guidance on both
<br>
their use and defense against.  Most importantly, rather than making bald
<br>
assertions (which would result in a 48 page stinker), the book is a wealth
<br>
of stories, fables, annecdotes, and historical events culled from ancient
<br>
China, classical Greek and Roman history, renaissance Italy, the medeieval
<br>
Church and more, with characters ranging from Cassanova, to the con-man
<br>
&quot;Yellow Kid&quot;  Weil, to Henry Kissinger. 
<br>
<p>It also has an interesting, almost hypertext structure that makes it fun
<br>
for brousing in small bits.  That is helpful, since it is not a thin book.
<br>
<p>I'd need to think more on it, and I would love some outside opinions, as
<br>
to whether this is &quot;extropian&quot;.  What it is is an unflinching look at how
<br>
people really go about influencing one another, for good or ill.  A modern
<br>
day Machiavelli.
