</em><br>
<p>Information Unlimited still publishes good designs for lasers and masers
<br>
of the home grown variety, and sells hard to get parts like HV
<br>
capacitors and diodes, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All the &quot;dangerouslabs.org&quot; kind of sites are actually kind of dissapointing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just little jet-powered carts and so-on, I remember building an ion &quot;cannon&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a young teen, and disturbing electronics from a distance, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malicious electronic weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone know what kind of legislation governs the private production of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed energy weapons, hipower lasers, or directed emp weapons?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On a related note, does the legislation on automatic and explosive firearms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover privately developed, prototype, or handbuilt non-commercial weapons?
</em><br>
<p>There are, I think, FCC regulations on classification of lasers and
<br>
masers based on power output, but nothing I know of which restricts who
<br>
can build them.
<br>
<p>The National Firearms Act of 1934 applies to any class II or III weapon
<br>
(sawed off shotguns, machine guns, etc) which applies, respectively, $5
<br>
and $200 taxes on the sale of such weapons. Technically it doesn't apply
<br>
to a person constructing their own personal weapon that fits in those
<br>
categories, but if you sell it to someone, you are breaking the law,
<br>
since the so-called Firearms Ownership Protection Act of 1986 banned the
<br>
sale of post-1986 manufactured Class II and III weapons to anyone
<br>
without a Federal Firearms License (Class III), and bans the sale BY
<br>
anyone without a class III manufacturers license of such devices.
<br>
&quot;selling&quot; under the NFA and FOPA is more than just exchanging for money.
<br>
If you die and leave it to a wife or other relative or friend, that is
<br>
considered a 'transfer' under the law, and comes under ATF jurisdiction.
<br>
If the person receiving the item doesn't have the proper FFL, and file
<br>
the paperwork, they are SOL and might as well just junk it or keep it
<br>
hidden away. Transfers between FFL holders require paperwork to the ATF,
<br>
but don't incur the tax.
<br>
<p>So if you make your own, put it in a locked box and don't show it to
<br>
anyone, or tell anyone about it (especially psychotic female roomates,
<br>
girlfriends or wives, since I know of two fellows who owned such weapons
<br>
and were ratted on by such after breakups).
<br>
<p>The NFA of 34 and the FOPA of 86 do not cover lasers, masers, or emp
<br>
devices, though these may be classified as Destructive Devices if
<br>
powerful enough.
