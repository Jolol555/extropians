<em>&gt; &gt;I'm not disputing that there are short term ups and downs.  Is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;there something we (or the government) should do differently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because of that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing that we (extropians) ought to do differently is to base our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions of future opposition to new technologies on the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that such opposition will be motivated by expected harm (as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nearly useless hypothesis of stupidity that is somewhat popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here), and to criticise luddites as selfish rather than as stupid people.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that stupidity of our opponents isn't a useful hypothesis. 
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to say motivates those who oppose
<br>
change.  Do you mean that they expect the average affect of some
<br>
change to be negative, or that they expect particular people to be
<br>
negatively affected?  (I think we agree that particular people will 
<br>
often be negatively affected.)
<br>
<p>Clearly there are some opponents with each view.  Since you suggest
<br>
attacking luddites as selfish, you must believe that the general
<br>
affect of (particular) changes is positive.  Do you think the
<br>
luddites understand this?  Or is the point that the general public
<br>
can be convinced that the general affect is positive enough that the
<br>
particular harms can be offset or neglected?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;I wouldn't have argued for an objective answer.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;seemed clear to me that most here (including you) would have agreed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that people who know how to make buggy whips don't lose anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;objective (anything they should be compensated for by the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or anything they should be able to sue for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do think they lose something objective, much like what a copyright
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holder loses when a copyright expires.  The existence of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objective loss doesn't imply the existence of someone who ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compensate the loser.  A system of compensation might cause less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harm than some of the trade barriers that governments create to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protect jobs, but a better approach would be to create futures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;markets whose prices communicate future wages in particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;industries and enable employees to hedge some of their risks.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I'm willing to accept your meaning of objective since you
<br>
agree that it doesn't imply that anyone owes something for the loss.
<br>
A futures market seems like a good way of allowing people both to 
<br>
learn what the prospects are in various lines of work, and to 
<br>
arbitrage away some of their exposure.  (What a surprise that we 
<br>
agree that idea futures are a good thing.  :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Being not bothered by negative externalities sounds a lot like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignoring them. Maybe that's appropriate when the negative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;externalities are an inevitable consequence of what creates the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positive ones, but in many cases I doubt the connection between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the two is inevitable.
</em><br>
<p>I think I appear to ignore them because I'm still waiting for
<br>
evidence that these negative externalities are important enough to
<br>
be worth acting on.  I can see that pollution affects everyone
<br>
nearby, whether they're a party to the polluting activity or not. 
<br>
Every time I think about the negative externalities that &quot;Luxury
<br>
Fever&quot; discussed, it looks like they only affect those who buy
<br>
into the comparative scale of wealth.  I don't see that I've done
<br>
something extraordinary in order to feel immune to this competition,
<br>
so it looks to me like an externality that anyone can opt out of.
<br>
<p>Not many do opt out, so maybe I should take it more seriously.  But
<br>
it feels like the best thing I can do for anyone feeling envious or
<br>
comparatively poor is to show them that it's possible to not worry
<br>
about it.
