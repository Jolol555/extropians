I have suggested this venue elsewhwere to extropians as a possible convenient meeting place.  Tomorrow evening might be an ideal time to check it out and also have a fine night of entertainment, perhaps even in the company of other extropians - I plan to be there at least (the short muscular guy with the beard, the orange motorcycle helmet, the backback). 
<br>
<p>A local libertarian objectivist web designer, FOI-hacker friend first introduced me to this band.  They are really quite original and good - think Neil Young, maybe Moody Blues with mideastern minor keying mixed in, really rich, intricat melodies and complex lyrics, heavy on the romantic side, but with really high energy.  Not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation - outside anyway.
<br>
<p>The coffee and food are also quite good and very reasonably priced.  This place is a local hangout for the digerati as well as a crew of science fiction fans.  
<br>
<p>You might want to bring your MP3 recorder, if you have one.

hi phil.
<br>
if there ever WAS a time for you to come see us play, 
<br>
this friday will be a doozy. 
<br>
<p>the gypsy den
<br>
2930 bristol ave (THE LAB)
<br>
costa mesa, ca
<br>

<br>
8pm
<br>
<p>first up, our friend johnny scaglione 
<br>
and &quot;the gospel of gloom and gladness&quot; 
<br>
will be starting off the night at 8. 
<br>
johnny was most recently in the band 'butterfly jones' - formerly DADA - and is a brilliant singer/songwriter. 
<br>
<p>he'll be singing some of his brand new songs and you 
<br>
will be amazed.  come early. do not miss this! 
<br>
<p>THEN we'll have some spoken word/storytelling from 
<br>
the incredible darcy staniforth (dj at kuci and spinster extraordinaire) in between bands. you'll laugh. you'll cry. you'll shout for joy.
<br>
<p>finally, the michael miller crusade (full band) will kick out the jams.
<br>
<p>it should be quite an entertaining evening.
<br>
<p>i recommend you get there a hair early. the last couple times we've 
<br>
played here have been pretty packed and the tables fill up very fast.
<br>
<p>it is a sunny day. hooray.
<br>
michael
