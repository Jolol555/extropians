Max,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert, have you done any kind of survey of investing habits in our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no.  So I may be drawing conclusions where there aren't
<br>
many facts in evidence.  I do wonder though if there isn't an implicit
<br>
assumption that the NanoSantas or the SysOp or the Singularity will
<br>
arrive so soon that we don't need to prepare for the alternatives.
<br>
<p>As many I'm sure know, I've devoted a lot of time to considering what
<br>
our hazard function(s) really are and how one might push them lower.
<br>
For example, the general trend in the U.S. accident rates, if continued
<br>
for this century, pushes expected longevity from ~2000 to ~6000 years.
<br>
But getting it to tens of thousands of years as was mentioned in the Spike
<br>
seems *really* difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you have not seen evidence because you have not asked for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have any evidence to the contrary?
</em><br>
<p>Point taken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; though I did have the foresight to be building two other more stable reserves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Hal noted, it really is *not* safe in the long run to invest and forgot. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  That was why I mentioned both a mutual fund and a savings account.
<br>
Obviously, one could lose fortunes if one doesn't pay attention to both
<br>
the markets and the currency valuations.  I believe classic economic
<br>
theory predicts that the U.S. dollar should depreciate over time due to
<br>
the U.S. trade deficit, but it seems that rule has been suspended over
<br>
the last several decades.  So how one &quot;manages&quot; this effectively isn't
<br>
exactly clear.
<br>
<p>It used to be that you needed to devote real human resources to managing
<br>
this type of thing, but I'd suspect now that the computer programs for
<br>
asset allocation are giving the human managers a run for their money.
<br>
The only problem comes up when computers cannot include in their models
<br>
events that have never happened before (e.g. will or will not the Japanese
<br>
banking system go belly up?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Almost every country has been through periods where you were likely to lose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, all the more reason to not optimize for yield, but to optimize
<br>
for security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Saving heavily in early years of relatively low income may not be optimal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand I would argue that (almost) *always* saving gets you into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a healthy habit.
</em><br>
<p>Clearly!  If one does believe the NanoSantas, SysOps or Singularity will
<br>
arrive in the next 15-30 years, then investing of any type at all
<br>
may be rather foolish.  On the other hand if one has a life-philosophy
<br>
of being prepared in case &quot;shit happens&quot;, then it makes good sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert, do you want to suggest wording for an ExI-Community poll?
</em><br>
<p>I'll give it some thought and see what I can come up with.
<br>
<p>Robert
