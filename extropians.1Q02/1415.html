<p>
I wanted to announce here the results of the recent World Transhumanist
<br>
Association (WTA) Board/EC election for officers, just to make clear the
<br>
current WTA leadership, since some continue to conflate my views with those
<br>
of the WTA:
<br>
<p>WTA Board of Directors
<br>
<p>Chair        Nick Bostrom Ph.D.
<br>
Vice-Chair   Eugene Leitl M.S.
<br>
Secretary    James Hughes Ph.D.
<br>
Treasurer    Mike Treder
<br>
Publications Director   Mark Walker Ph.D.
<br>
(Members without portfoloio)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziana Astralos
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Pearce
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anders Sandberg M.S.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer Yudkowsky
<br>
<p>More about the Board at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/executive_committee.htm">http://www.transhumanism.org/executive_committee.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The current broader WTA decision-making body, which adopted the WTA
<br>
constitution and elected the interim Board, and which will be called upon
<br>
for decisions as needed (such as naming our new magazine, Human++, this
<br>
week), is the membership of the wtahall list in yahoogroups:
<br>
<p>(including the members of the WTA Board plus) Alan Grimes, Alex Boko, Amara
<br>
Angelica, E. Shaun, Floss, Frnak Prengel, Garret Smyth, Hal Finney, John
<br>
Smart, Matthias Ernst, Max More, M.J. Geddes, Natasha Vita More, Torsten
<br>
Nahm, D. den Otter, Samantha Atkins, Theo Theodorus Ibrahim, Frank Tipler,
<br>
and <a href="mailto:mountain@wanadoo.nl?Subject=Re:%20WTA%20Officers%20and%20Membership">mountain@wanadoo.nl</a> (I've forgotten who this is, sorry).
<br>
<p>Now that we have adopted membership dues, the way to participate in the
<br>
formal governance of the WTA, and to be added to the wtahall list, is to
<br>
become a full member of the WTA. Dues are $25 for employed folks in the
<br>
developed world, and $10 for students, the unemployed, the retired and folks
<br>
in the developing world, payable to: &quot;WTA,&quot; 72 Van Reipen Ave, PMB 255,
<br>
Jersey City, NJ  07306-2806
<br>
<p>Please also fill out the membership form at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/join.htm">http://www.transhumanism.org/join.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The ExI and local chapters of the ExI may become formal affiliates of the
<br>
WTA by paying annual dues ($25). Formal affiliates and chapters of the WTA
<br>
also receive one vote on wtahall.
<br>
<p>The folks on WTAhall list now are grandfathered in until the Board
<br>
determines that a sufficient number of &gt;Hists have paid dues to become full
<br>
members, at which time those who haven't paid dues yet will need to fish or
<br>
cut bait.
<br>
<p>Those of you who would like to participate in the WTA in a cheaper, and less
<br>
formal, way may join one or both of our two public lists:
<br>
<p>- <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-talk/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-talk/</a>  presumably this will be WTA's
<br>
version of the extrop list, although hopefully lower volume and we are
<br>
looking for a strong moderator to excise abusive posters
<br>
<p>and /or
<br>
<p>- <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-announce">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-announce</a> for official WTA announcements
<br>
<p>Hopefully the above makes clear that the WTA is not dominated by any
<br>
particular political viewpoint, includes a healthy representation of
<br>
extropians at all levels of decision-making, and is open to extropian
<br>
membership.
<br>
<p>I would be glad to answer any questions about WTA membership off-list.
