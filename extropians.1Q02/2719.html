<p>&lt;&lt; BTW: One large reason among several for me deciding not to return to
<br>
&nbsp;live in the U.S. is the U.S government's current &quot;War on *&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;stupidities.  There's a bit more sane attitude about that nonsense in
<br>
&nbsp;Europe. But maybe not for long. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My take on this goes something like this. World War 3 was won by the 
<br>
republics against the Soviet Union, circa 1991. This is currently World War 
<br>
4, and its being fought against terrorism. Terrorism from whom? Terrorism 
<br>
from Islamic Fundamentalist Muslims. This war will take a long time, and 
<br>
victory by the USA is by no means assured. Like the Cold War before it, this 
<br>
war is ideological. What is at stake? For whatever reason, as is now being 
<br>
demonstrated with that London educated sheik, who is on the run from the 
<br>
authorities (allegedly). This fellow, along with millions of fellow Muslims 
<br>
yearn for the destruction of America and the founding of Sharia, and a new 
<br>
Muslim ascendency. 
<br>
<p>So what to do on either side of the Atlantic? Well, like the Cold Warm, 
<br>
before it, life did not stop, either intellectually or culturally, because we 
<br>
were locked in a struggle with the Soviets. Waiting for America to 
<br>
'cool-down' is a waste of your time. The Islamic opponents (enemies) wish the 
<br>
physical destruction of this nation and will acquire nukes, gas, or 
<br>
bioweapons, to achieve this. Perhaps (I am not being sarcastic) Europe can 
<br>
and should sit this one out. Placating the Wahabbis, and their allies will do 
<br>
no good. What may come out of this is, hopefully, and accelerated move 
<br>
towards renewable resources for transportation, and electricity. This would 
<br>
end the war years quicker.
