I don't think it matters much whether your cell phone is 1 or 3 years old.
<br>
The problem comes more when you are using the same technology for 5,
<br>
10, 20, 50 years without change.  This is stagnation and it's an easy
<br>
trap to fall into.
<br>
<p>Consider two 70 year olds.  One is on the internet, talks to the grand
<br>
kids by email and communicates using chat and message boards with people
<br>
who have shared interests.  The other listens to old Jack Benny programs
<br>
on the radio.  Which one would you want to be?
<br>
<p>The little decisions we make from day to day, our attitudes towards
<br>
technology adoption, put us on the path towards one of these two futures.
<br>
It is all too easy to fall into the path of stagnation, relying on the
<br>
safe and well-known technologies of the past rather than making the
<br>
effort to stretch the mind and keep up with changes.
<br>
<p>I'm getting into middle age, as I think a considerable number of people
<br>
are here.  Mental flexibility doesn't come automatically.  You have to
<br>
adopt a conscious attitude of rejecting the old and accepting the new in
<br>
order to overcome ingrained habits.  It will always be easier to keep
<br>
what you know.  All those years of using a familiar technology drive
<br>
deep ruts in your brain, and hopping out of them takes effort.
<br>
<p>I find that the way the brain works, it fools you into thinking that old
<br>
technologies are better, when in fact they are just more comfortable.
<br>
You have to adopt a conscious bias towards new technologies in order
<br>
to overcome this mental error.  Then you can have a balance between
<br>
pointless neophilia and hidebound stagnation.
<br>
