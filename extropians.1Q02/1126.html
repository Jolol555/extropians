<em>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Transgender%20marriage">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Just to set the record straight:  Gays do not want domestic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;partners laws. These were invented as a diversion to keep gays
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from getting regular marriages.  In Vermont, for example, gays
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really don't get the same kind of marriage.  The laws are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;separate, the terms are different, the forms are different, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;procedures for dissolving it are different.  Contrary to confusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims, gays cannot get married anywhere in the U.S.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;misleading claim that gays can marry in Vermont just makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harder for them to push for equal marriage rights in that state.
</em><br>
<p>The majority of heterosexuals are not currently prepared to extend
<br>
the idea of marriage to include same sex marriages.
<br>
<p>They site historical as well as religious precedent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Similarly, gays never wanted &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the military.  This was invented by conservatives.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effectively a gag order on gays that says if anyone finds out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're gay you will be kicked out.  This is worse than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;previous situation where they had to prove illegal sexual conduct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a military court-martial.  Now, a person who &quot;thinks they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gay&quot; without ever acting on it can be kicked out, and is presumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guilty unless they challenge in court and prove they are not gay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is worse than what the situation was before.  Although it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been portrayed in the conservative media as an example of gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights, it actually was fought by gays and is considered by gays
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be a reduction in rights.
</em><br>
<p>The obvious solution as portrayed in the movie &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;
<br>
is to put everyone in together, no segration based on gender, race,
<br>
or sexual orientation.
<br>
<p>Something I doubt the military or American society is ready for.
