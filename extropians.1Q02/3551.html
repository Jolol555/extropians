Oh, one RTS that had at least a lot of high technology was Total 
<br>
Annihilation.  The back story is about this war between the CORE and ARM 
<br>
which has been going on for A Long Time Now and has consumed most of the 
<br>
galaxy's resources.  Originally, the CORE ruled the galaxy, but when 
<br>
uploading became feasible, they insisted that everybody be uploaded for 
<br>
their own good.  Some people didn't like this, and rebelled, forming the 
<br>
ARM (I don't know if the names stand for anything).  Since they don't have 
<br>
uploaded soldiers the ARM uses clones with Neural interfaces in all their 
<br>
vehicles.  Both sides use hard nanotechnology to build units and buildings, 
<br>
harvest resources, etc. though the nanites don't reproduce in the 
<br>
environment.  The two resources you can get are energy and metal, and yes, 
<br>
you can turn energy into metal if you really need too or have some extra 
<br>
fusion generators lying around.
