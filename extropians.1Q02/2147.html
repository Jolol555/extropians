<em>&gt;&gt; I'm with Spike here.  I mean, sure, people can be free to be nude,

but

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of that is conditioning.  If you are nude then either the

</em><br>
<p>Not actually.  If I'm nude, it usually means I'm home and no one else is
<br>
here.  I generally wear few items of clothing when I'm &quot;home alone.&quot;:)
<br>
I'm fairly try and in shape, but it's actually just more comfortable for
<br>
me that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if you see someone nude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are either intruding on their bath or you evaluate them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sexual comeliness almost automatically and using sexual
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people for some time tends to mitigate.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so, but this sounds to me like if I listen to enough bad music,
<br>
eventually I'll be able to tune it out.  Why not just listen to great
<br>
music and forego developing a tuning out skill?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People's birthday suits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and the shape of their bodies are just what they are.  Yeah
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of them are a lot more fun to look at at various levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than others but after a while any upset at seeing skin goes away.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not upset.  Also, I find most people ugly from the neck up and even
<br>
their exposed portions, such as hands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Ugly&quot; is a very interesting notion that tends to shift with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectations and conditionings.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about that.  I can still deal with ugliness.  I mean I
<br>
don't run in horror when I see someone with an ugly face or whose hands
<br>
look like vienna sasauges mashed together or when someone has yellow
<br>
teeth with food particles stuck in them.  Etc.  I just don't
<br>
particularly see any point in wanting to see more.  And this is not even
<br>
going over odors and the like.
<br>
<p>Email is great in this fashion.  No offense, but I don't have to look at
<br>
any of you -- yet we can still exchange ideas.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
