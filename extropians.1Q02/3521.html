<p>
I'd like to add few other  'extropian' games:
<br>
<p><p>Call To Power 1/2 - clone of civilization but with better interface and
<br>
longer play time (from 4000BC to 3000AD). In advanced ages we have
<br>
nanotechnology, AI controlling your citizens, terrorists with those nasty
<br>
nano-attacks, ability to build orbital cities and other 'extro' features.
<br>
Downside of this game is poor AI (If you want to play it, use multiplayer
<br>
mode)
<br>
<p>UFO3 - X-COM Apocalypse - This game was the my first source of information
<br>
about extropians :o The story is that we are put into bright future of
<br>
mankind, into huge city called megalopolis governed by large organizations -
<br>
including extropians :) Here is what we can read in UFOpedia (kind of
<br>
encyclopedia covering the game's world background):
<br>
<p>'The extropians are one of the two earth federation political parties that
<br>
dominate city government. The extropian philosophy is basically a faith in a
<br>
bright technological future a brave new world free of disease, pollution,
<br>
old age and dull aesthetics. They pioneered the city regulations governing
<br>
the future retro styling of the architecture and vehicles. They have strong
<br>
support from 'Solmine', 'Marsec' and the larger corporations'
<br>
<p>There are other organizations that may exist in near future and are modeled
<br>
in this game including: sentient engine liberation front, technocrats,
<br>
nanotech, mutant alliance etc. UFO3 certainly has great atmosphere. BTW this
<br>
example shows that Transhumanism really makes its way to mainstream.
<br>
<p>Extropians who would like to see in action some greatest 'AI' should play
<br>
'Creatures 1/2/3' and 'Black+ACY-White'. This will demonstrate where we are
<br>
today with consumer AI engines. IMHO it's not so bad.
<br>
<p>For those who love outer space, there are two games that you shouldn't miss:
<br>
Elite / Elite 2 / First Encounters - the biggest worlds in computer games
<br>
I've ever seen+ADs- thousands of planets to explore, hundreds of solar systems
<br>
all of this with nice graphics. You can really get sucked in this game while
<br>
flying from old earth to barrent's star solar system selling for example
<br>
medicines with 10xCosts income (if you are smart enough to read electronic
<br>
newspaper and choose planets where some terrible plaque occurred :) Another
<br>
nice thing are spaceships. They are rather simple in piloting and design but
<br>
for the first time we have spaceships that move like spaceships not like
<br>
aircrafts, lasers beam that don't 'fly' and lots of other things that make
<br>
this game more simulation then another stupid s-f arcade crap.
<br>
<p>Battlecruiser 3000AD - This game is must have for all of those who enjoyed
<br>
Star Trek. We are captain of great, big, enormous space cruiser which
<br>
mission is... to serve federation bla, bla, bla, bla, bla. What is really
<br>
important (it's not plot if you still think it is :) is detailed simulation
<br>
of the space ship, its components, crew members and beautiful and detailed
<br>
world. We can move around from solar system to another solar system,  from
<br>
space station to planet surface (with appropriate shuttle), we can even
<br>
command our marines to descend on enemy planet and try to take over it. Oh,
<br>
and version 1.1 of this game is totally free to download (newer versions are
<br>
still in development).
<br>
<p>Maybe it's time to add another category of extropian stuff on T.E.C.H. site.
<br>
We've got extropian books, films, TV-shows, magazines - then why not
<br>
computer games?

+AD4- If you do please tell me what kind of,

+AD4- what's yor favorite title, and do you

<br>
+AD4- Personnally I can think up only one title - +ACI-Alpha Centauri+ACI-
<br>
+AD4- but this should be known to you because
<br>
+AD4- it's quite an old game so it doesn't need any extra
