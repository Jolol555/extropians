There are a couple of fundamental problems with measuring total knowledge.
<br>
The term knowledge includes several distinct things which are probably not
<br>
comparable. Also there is no &quot;unit of information/knowledge&quot; which we could
<br>
use for quantifying the total of human knowledge. On the other hand it's
<br>
clearly true to say that in most areas we know more and better than we did
<br>
even twenty years ago. A few ideas - you could use patents to measure
<br>
innovation (although this has the same kind of problems as using theses) -
<br>
we can measure the average time elapsed between the discovery of a technique
<br>
and its widespread adoption/use (this has clearly been getting much shorter
<br>
over the last 200 years) - we can measure the speed of geographical and
<br>
social diffusion of invention (again this is now much faster than it was
<br>
even 60 years ago) - we could have a list of questions/problems for academic
<br>
disciplines and see how many could be answered and with what degree of
<br>
assurance at various points in time up to the present (Hilbert's list of
<br>
problems in maths could be an example). Steve Davies

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;This is the Golden Age of Knowledge

<em>&gt; &gt; Estimated years it took for knowledge to double*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder where the sources of all these numbers are? They seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like other dramatic statistics (area of rainforest cleared every year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children killed by sanctions against Iraq, increases/decreases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminality) that are told and re-told again and again to bolster a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular position, but which nobody ever checks or can name their source.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, how could we measure actual progress? I have seen some numbers based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on number of scientific journals, papers or Ph.D. theses, but that only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works as long as the average knowledge in them remains constant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic or structural changes doesn't affect them. Amount of published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique text might be another scale (presumably the knowledge is equal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% of it, by Sturegon's law :-), although now the amount of web has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be taken into account.
