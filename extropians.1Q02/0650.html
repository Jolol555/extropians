</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Having been under the impression that I came to my own liberal foreground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because of a propensity to think (at least I've thought so, all these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;years), I decided to investigate libertarianism a bit, and what I found were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many sites where libertarians, gun advocates, Branch Davidians, homegrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;militias and the like are linked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know very little about the good Internet Web sites for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism, (and sorry to hear about the above) 
</em><br>
<p>ANY philosophy that embraces the idea that indidividuals should be free
<br>
to pursue their own political development free of the oppression of
<br>
political correctness is going to evolve many instances of crazy
<br>
aunts/uncles and familial black sheep. As a libertarian, I am far more
<br>
embarrassed by those libertarians who continue to cling to pet memes
<br>
that continue to embrace oppression of thought, expression, or
<br>
posession, which, IMHO is far more prevalent on the left end of the
<br>
libertarian world than that of the right wing, but that is because I
<br>
came to libertarianism from the Republican world. The fact that such
<br>
black sheep exist and flourish on both ends of the libertarian spectrum
<br>
is a credit to the philosophy, not a debit against it.
<br>
<p>I am sure that Olga, being of a left wing origin, was far less offended
<br>
by those libertarian web sites on the left who embrace forms of
<br>
oppression that agree with her own prejudices, like those that promote
<br>
the seizure of private property, the denial of individual right of self
<br>
defense, and the radical enforcement of economic homogeneity while
<br>
embracing social diversity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; however, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following books are the first that I recommend to anyone who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in investigating libertarianism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Friedman: _Machinery of Freedom_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see: <a href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/#mybooks">http://www.best.com/~ddfr/#mybooks</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Henry Hazlitt: _Economics in One Lesson_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see:  <a href="http://www.hazlitt.org/">http://www.hazlitt.org/</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you still are interested to learn more of the political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism philosophy, then continue with the great classic:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frederick A. Hayak: _The Road to Serfdom_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see: <a href="http://people.clarityconnect.com/webpages3/davek/docs/HAYSERF.HTML">http://people.clarityconnect.com/webpages3/davek/docs/HAYSERF.HTML</a>)
</em><br>
<p>The thing is that all of these references find much more agreement from
<br>
those who sponsor the websites Olga was offended by (gun advocates,
<br>
Davidians, militias, etc) than those on the left end of the libertarian
<br>
spectrum. Most left libertarians vehemently oppose the arguments of
<br>
Friedman and Hayak, and vociferously claim that people like Harry
<br>
Browne, author of &quot;How I Found Freedom In An Unfree World&quot; are not
<br>
'true' libertarians, but just right wing neo-nazi bastardizations of
<br>
'real' libertarianism.
<br>
<p>What this says about the dedication of the left to libertarian
<br>
principles about non-initiation of force is left to the reader.
