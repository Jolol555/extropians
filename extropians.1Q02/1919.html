<em>&gt; I'm sure that what you have described is what all interested parties are most

</em><br>
<p>Yes, however being that chlorophyll is more efficient than rhodopsin at
<br>
photosynthesis at atmospheric densities and gas concentrations similar
<br>
to that of our current climate, and that human civilization is the only
<br>
currently known example of intelligent technological life forms, logic
<br>
demands, if we are searching for other similar species, to focus on
<br>
discovering other worlds with similar spectral features. Furthermore,
<br>
such worlds are of immensely greater importance to humans if we ever
<br>
master interstellar travel than any other planetary body.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One other opinion. The notion that many educated people seem blase' about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life previously existing on Mars (for example) to me seems wrong-headed. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life was ever demonstrated to have lived on Mars, it would surely alter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humankind's' perspective on the universe. 
</em><br>
<p>However, this is immaterial to the present discussion about our ability
<br>
to sense current life on earthlike extrasolar planets through spectral
<br>
analysis. Few intelligent people today doubt that such life exists, and
<br>
many are aware that Mars once had a climate very similar to that present
<br>
on Earth today which would have been conducive to the formation of life.
<br>
The fact we can't currently sense such a photosynthetic signature on
<br>
Mars is indicative of it's current sterility, at least on the surface.
