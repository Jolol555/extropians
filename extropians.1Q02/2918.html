<em>&gt; &gt; Imperialism, as an ideology, did survive the Great War.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argue that its ideological underpinnings were strengthened by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the downfall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the Dual Monarchy, Germany, Russia and the Ottomans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Countries during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interwar period who wished to overturn the Versailles treaty settlement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewed the expansion of their power in territorial and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inperialistic terms:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; German lebensraum, Italy in Abyssinia, Japan and Manchukuo. Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; governmental ideologies incorporated the dynamic of imperialism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and married
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it to new racial and national extremes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mike Lorrey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;Let's respond to these assertions step by step.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, no, and yes. WWI was initially a war between empires.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it ended as a war that fostered empires as well. Those states who
<br>
won expanded their territories. Great Britain's empire was at its peak in
<br>
terms of territory following the war as the settlement was structured on
<br>
imperial terms. Why? Because self-determination, the major achievement of
<br>
Wilsonian diplomacy, which favoured minority (rather than human) rights, was
<br>
considered applicable to Europe rather than to the imperial territories by
<br>
the existing empires. Their subjects were viewed as racially and culturally
<br>
inferior, ie they did not have the requisite qualities of governance that
<br>
would allow self-determination to proceed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; WWII was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war between empire builders and democracy builders. The British Empire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was on the ropes through the 1920's and 30's, as was the French.
</em><br>
<p>Both Empires suffered from 'imperial overstretch' and the economic
<br>
dislocations that disfigured this period. But there is no historical
<br>
evidence to suggest that the governing classes of either country were
<br>
willing to give up territory at this time or were losing control of their
<br>
colonies (and this includes the transfer of self-governance to the Old
<br>
Commonwealth). If you are referring to the policy of appeasement, then you
<br>
must take into account the timescales that Stanley Baldwin and Neville
<br>
Chamberlain were juggling with to provide a feasible timescale for
<br>
rearmamemnt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Germany
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost its colonies entirely and AustroHungary was broken up entirely at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Versailles. The British only kept India through WWII by promising to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant independence after the war.
</em><br>
<p>To the contrary, Ghandi rejected the proposals of Sir Stafford Cripps's
<br>
mission in 1942 and embarked on the 'Quit India' campaign, a continuation of
<br>
nonviolent pressure upon the Raj in order to obtain self-government and
<br>
postwar independence. The British, faced with an invasion of the japanese
<br>
from Burma, rounded up Ghandi, Nehru and outlawed the Congress Party.
<br>
Postwar independence was a political goal of the 1945 Labour government and
<br>
this was the open door through which the independence of India was achieved.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Italy, well, Italy, quitely plainly,
<br>
<em>&gt; was a joke as far as imperialists go.
</em><br>
<p>Italy was a pivotal state for european diplomacy from 1932 to 1936 and was
<br>
not considered a joke by then. It was also a good example of why territory
<br>
does not equal power as much as influence does.
<br>
<p>The Ottomans fell after WWI as
<br>
<em>&gt; well.
</em><br>
<p>Said this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The British and French empires remained in existence at this time, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remained symbols of national strength for their electorates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anti-imperialistic arguments in Europe were mainly derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Marxist-Leninist theory and never gained much credence beyond the Left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Imperialism in Britain eventually lost its ideological grip with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Atlantic Charter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps imperialism did lose its ideological hold upon the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under Wilson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the Versailles Treaty and its principle of self-determination had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; battle with the long-standing notions of racial and cultural superiority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that justified empire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THis is not really that accurate. Wilson's ideas gained quite a wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public acceptance throughout Europe after the war, it was really only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the aristocrats who resented the implications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This should be viewed on national rather than social criteria. New states in
<br>
Europe, whose legitimations were based upon the principle of
<br>
self-determination and the rights of nations to create their own countries,
<br>
would be attracted to this particular unspoken principle of Wilson's 14
<br>
points. Most of his points referred to Europe and where he did argue that
<br>
the indigenous people should have their views taken into account in the
<br>
adjustment of colonies (&quot;Point V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely
<br>
impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance
<br>
of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the
<br>
interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the
<br>
equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.&quot;), he
<br>
was ignored.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike Lorrey wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Countries would not go to war against each other if one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other were not lying about their point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you wish to view a war in terms of the ideologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; participants, how do you distinguish between their ideas and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in support of their point of view? snip...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Propaganda, per se, is not always a lie. There are two forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; propaganda: information and disinformation. One is truth, the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; falsehood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Propaganda is always a form of untruth as the authors wish the reader or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observer to privelege a particular interpretation. The author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is hoping that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their work is structured in such a way that it will make your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind up for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But nothing you say here demonstrates that all interpretations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untruths. If even on interpretation is accurate, then propaganda for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that point of view is not an untruth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Here, we are probably saying similar things in different ways. A reader
<br>
would be able to gauge what may be true within propaganda if he has
<br>
sufficient knowledge and critical faculties to maintain a sceptical stance.
<br>
However, if an author has structured his work (be it a book, an article or a
<br>
film) to persuade the reader that a particular political goal is worthwhile,
<br>
then surely that work can no longer be considered objective as it is a tool
<br>
to promote a particular worldview.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Studies of British propaganda during WWII found that it was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modify deeply held attitudes but that you could reinforce and exacerbate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preexisting attitudes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, stunning defeats are quite effective at making people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reevaluate their assumptions.
</em><br>
<p>Just to clarify here, these studies were looking at Home Front propaganda.
<br>
Leaflets over Axis countries had little effect and, as you quite rightly
<br>
say, defeat and unconditional surrender destroyed the legitimacy of the
<br>
fascist and Nazi regimes. It does show that propaganda has limited affects
<br>
at the end of the day and demonstrates that governments have limited
<br>
abilities to re-engineer the cultural sensibilities of their citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. However, nationalism being wrong and false does not mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; everything it involves is automatically false (just as a KKK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; still tell the truth when he says the sky is blue).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectively ranking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; one form of polity as objectively better than another is significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; different from having blind faith in one's nation, right or wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The terms 'false' and 'wrong' are only applicable if you wish to view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; history as a conflict between rationalism and irrationalism (which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; include your definition of faith). However, it is not possible for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nationalist to set down objective criteria in order to assess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; s/he develops an exaggerated sense of belonging to their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentiment and/or loyalty. This is not a statement saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ranking of polities is impossible but that one has to reflect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on these views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and discount them before attempting suvh an assessment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, the individual should decide first what sort of country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they think, according to facts of human nature, would be the best to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live and prosper in, then see what countries match up best to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criteria.
</em><br>
<p>Can this work in practice? My suburban south-east englishness is engrained
<br>
and, even after discounting its contribution to my conscious sense of
<br>
identity, it remains the mould for my habits and sentiments. I will always
<br>
be biased to a certain region, my own locality, through habit and
<br>
familiarity. You offer a tabula rasa that requires a reinvention of identity
<br>
most individuals are unable to achieve - an unattainable level of
<br>
objectivity.
