<em>&gt; &quot;free&quot; and then talk about burning diamonds for fuel and having a whole suit

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Louis, *you're* doing it again.  Right now diamond is expensive. 
<br>
Nanotechnology produces diamond as a waste product.  If you convert carbon
<br>
in its other forms into diamond, you get a large amount of energy *out* of
<br>
the chemical reaction.  That's why diamonds are so hard - you have to
<br>
expend that amount of energy, add it back in, before you can break the
<br>
molecular bonds.
<br>
<p>When you look at a description of a diamondoid space suit and protest that
<br>
not even Bill Gates could afford it, you are applying your
<br>
twentieth-century expectations to a surface description of the future. 
<br>
You take this one concept, &quot;space suit made of diamonds&quot; (which it isn't;
<br>
&quot;diamondoid&quot; isn't the same thing at all), and then applying the
<br>
twentieth-century concept that diamonds are expensive, and concluding that
<br>
nobody can afford the space suit.  But the concept doesn't exist in
<br>
isolation.  Along with the concept of a diamondoid space suit goes the
<br>
concept of diamond, not as expensive rocks dug up out of the ground, but
<br>
as a waste material produced by exothermic and exoergic nanotech
<br>
manufacturing processes.
<br>
<p>What you do have with nanotechnology is the diamondoid recycling problem. 
<br>
As I pointed out at the last Foresight Gathering when the topic of
<br>
recycling came up, &quot;a diamond is not forever&quot;, but it's probably more
<br>
efficient to disintegrate it - take the energy output of a power plant or
<br>
a solar mirror and run the diamondoid material through en masse - rather
<br>
than disassembling it atom-by-atom, as I've heard proposed.
<br>
<p>Speaking of which, Robert, are you sure that it's possible to consume
<br>
diamond and oxygen as a fuel?  Are you sure you aren't thinking of a
<br>
rocket-suit that got you into orbit by turning something else, maybe
<br>
acetylene, into the diamondoid suit?
<br>
