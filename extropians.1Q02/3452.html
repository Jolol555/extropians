<p>There certainly are. But you can't package a mailing list, and a think
<br>
tank that does not think about questions specific to your company's
<br>
interests or show how their issues relate to your interests will not be
<br>
particularly worthwhile. You can certainly mine the list for good ideas,
<br>
or even insert ideas into it to see if anybody comes up with anything,
<br>
but the actual interface with companies and organisations has to be a
<br>
structured organisational entity that can deal with them in the
<br>
traditional way, make contracts, do quality control and so on. There is
<br>
a market for smart future-oriented commercial think tanks (I know this
<br>
because I'm involved with one), but they need a firmer organization than
<br>
a list or virtual community to work. I think it would be a smart step
<br>
for transhumanism to start up a number of such organisations right now,
<br>
in order to really sell transhumanism to the world. My experience is
<br>
that it is far easier to convince people by selling them ideas, analysis
<br>
and papers than by giving them away.
