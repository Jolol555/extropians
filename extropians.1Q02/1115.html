Hi all, my first encounter with the 'extropians' was a small article written
<br>
in an old issue of 'Skeptic Magazine' The article was short but spoke of
<br>
extropians in a positive light, but made a point to recognize that people
<br>
can uncritically support any view point if it supports their world view.
<br>
The article warned of worshiping technological advance like a god.  Though
<br>
it conceded that the extropians had a good point, at least for most problems
<br>
that plague humanity that can be solved will likely be solved through
<br>
science and technology, but considered the question of cheating death and
<br>
disease too far off to guarantee a resolution too.  The article mentioned
<br>
some of the members, such as Roy Walford, Marvin Minksy, and Kurzweil,
<br>
people I knew of, read books by, and respected.  Shermer, who is the
<br>
publisher of Skeptic magazine, now produces a skeptic bent TV shot called
<br>
'Exploring the Unknown' and writes a monthly column in Scientific American
<br>
under the title Skeptic.  A few months back, he re-iterated the warnings of
<br>
uncritically placing faith in something (in this case the progress of
<br>
technology) when writing of cryogenic suspension.  This month, however, he
<br>
writes an article describing how the first extra terrestrial intelligence we
<br>
come across will likely be so advanced as they will appear 'godlike' to us.
<br>
Interestingly, he hits on very extropian themes such as the singularity and
<br>
the prophetic and logical predictions of Kurzweil in 'Spiritual machines'
<br>
It seems that extropian ideas are creeping into the mainstream more science
<br>
fields more and more.  
<br>
<p>Here is the article.
<br>
<p>Enjoy

<p>SHERMER'S LAST LAW
<br>
<p>We have two spring events planned at Caltech: March 3 (John George on
<br>
Extremism and Terrorism) and April 28 (British cosmologist Janna Levin on
<br>
&quot;How the Universe Got its Spots&quot;). More on these later. Meanwhile, I thought
<br>
I would post my latest Scientific American column because this one generated
<br>
more reader mail than all my previous columns combined (9 previous ones). It
<br>
was mostly mail from Christians who argued that God cannot merely be an ET
<br>
because no ET would die for your sins. Here's the column. It appeared in the
<br>
January issue of Scientific American.
<br>
<p>Shermer's Last Law
<br>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence is
<br>
indistinguishable
<br>
from God
<br>
<p>Michael Shermer
<br>
<p>As scientist extraordinaire (most profoundly as inventor of the
<br>
communications satellite) and author of an empire of science fiction books
<br>
and films (most notably _2001: A Space Odyssey_), Arthur C. Clarke is one of
<br>
the most far-seeing visionaries of our time. Thus, his pithy quotations tug
<br>
harder on our collective psyches for their inferred insights into humanity
<br>
and our place in the cosmos. And none do so more than his famous three laws:
<br>
<p>Clark's First Law: &quot;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that
<br>
something is possible he is almost certainly right. When he sing the limits 
<br>
of the possible
<br>
is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.&quot;
<br>
<p>Clarke's Third Law: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is
<br>
indistinguishable from magic.&quot;
<br>
<p>This last observation stimulated me to think more on the relationship of
<br>
science and religion, particularly the impact the discovery of an
<br>
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (ETI) would have on both traditions. To that
<br>
end I would like to immodestly propose Shermer's Last Law (I don't believe
<br>
in naming laws after oneself, so as the good book warns, the last shall be
<br>
first and the first shall be last): _Any sufficiently advanced ETI is
<br>
indistinguishable from God_.
<br>
<p>God is typically described by Western religions as omniscient and
<br>
omnipotent.
<br>
Since we are far from the mark on these traits, how could we possibly
<br>
distinguish a God who has them absolutely, from an ETI who has them in
<br>
relatively (to us) copious amounts? Thus, we would be unable to distinguish
<br>
between absolute and relative omniscience and omnipotence. But if God were
<br>
only relatively more knowing and powerful than us, then by definition it
<br>
_would_ be an ETI! Consider two observations and one deduction:
<br>
<p>1. Biological evolution operates at a snail's pace compared to technological
<br>
evolution (the former is Darwinian and requires generations of differential
<br>
reproductive success, the latter is Lamarckian and can be implemented within
<br>
a single generation). 2. The cosmos is very big and space is very empty
<br>
(_Voyager I_, our most distant spacecraft hurtling along at over 38,000 mph,
<br>
will not reach the distance of even our sun's nearest neighbor, the Alpha
<br>
Centauri system that it is _not_ even headed toward, for over 75,000 years).
<br>
Ergo, the probability of an ETI who is only slightly more advanced than us
<br>
and also makes contact is virtually nil. If we ever do find ETI it will be
<br>
as
<br>
if a million-year-old _Homo erectus_ were dropped into the middle of
<br>
Manhattan, given a computer and cell phone and instructed to communicate
<br>
with
<br>
us. ETI would be to us as we would be to this early hominid--godlike.
<br>
<p>Science and technology have changed our world more in the past century than
<br>
it changed in the previous hundred centuries. It took 10,000 years to get
<br>
from the cart to the airplane, but only 66 years to get from powered flight
<br>
to a lunar landing. Moore's Law of computer power doubling every eighteen
<br>
months continues unabated and is now down to about a year. Ray Kurzweil, in
<br>
_The Age of Spiritual Machines_, calculates that there have been thirty-two
<br>
doublings since World War II, and that the Singularity point may be upon us
<br>
as early as 2030. The Singularity (as in the center of a black hole where
<br>
matter is so dense that its gravity is infinite) is the point at which total
<br>
computational power will rise to levels that are so far beyond anything that
<br>
we can imagine that they will appear near infinite and thus, relatively
<br>
speaking, be indistinguishable from omniscience (note the suffix!).
<br>
<p>When this happens the world will change more in a decade than it did in the
<br>
previous thousand decades. Extrapolate that out a hundred thousand years, or
<br>
a million years (an eye blink on an evolutionary time scale and thus a
<br>
realistic estimate of how far advanced ETI will be, unless we happen to be
<br>
the first space-faring species, which is unlikely), and we get a
<br>
gut-wrenching, mind-warping feel for just how godlike these creatures would
<br>
seem.
<br>
<p>In Clarke's 1953 novel _Childhood's End_, humanity reaches something like a
<br>
Singularity (with help from ETIs) and must make the transition to a higher
<br>
state of consciousness in order to grow out of childhood. One character
<br>
early
<br>
in the novel opines that &quot;Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as
<br>
well
<br>
as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware,
<br>
the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now.
<br>
<p>Although science has not even remotely destroyed religion, Shermer's Last
<br>
Law
<br>
predicts that the relationship between the two will be profoundly effected
<br>
by
<br>
contact with ETI. To find out how we must follow Clarke's Second Law,
<br>
venturing courageously past the limits of the possible and into the unknown.
<br>
Ad astra!
