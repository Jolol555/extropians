<em>&gt; I realise this sounds gruesome to many people, but it would

<em>&gt; Peoples selfish instincts are usually much more reliable than their

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From a philosophical libertarian standpoint this is of course the right
</em><br>
thing to do, since it is both a consequence of self-ownership and would
<br>
help make this concept more visible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a practical standpoint it is less clear that it would be a good
</em><br>
idea. The supply is far below the demand, and is not getting better
<br>
since people are using more helmets and seatbelts in traffic (= less
<br>
braindead young motorcyclists) and many previously fatal conditions can
<br>
now be treated. This is by transplants from old people are increasing -
<br>
the organs are not as good as young organs, but they are available.
<br>
Trade would not really be able to improve on this, at least for
<br>
transplants requiring dead donors. It might be helpful when it comes to
<br>
kidneys and other organs that can be transplanted from living donors.
<br>
Most likely the market value of a heart transplant would be far higher
<br>
than the current cost, making many HMOs and socialized health care
<br>
systems loath to pay for them. 
<br>
<p>Trade can sometimes have paradoxal effects. In Britain they lowered the
<br>
pay for blood donations in order to improve the blood quality - many
<br>
alcoholics and other addicts were donating blood to pay for their habit,
<br>
making much of it substandard. 
<br>
<p>Politically this is so far beyond the pale, and strongly resisted by
<br>
both bioethicists and the medical community. Getting this kind of idea
<br>
through will take quite some time, and will necessarily imply taking a
<br>
philosophical, rhetorical and political fight with several established
<br>
groups. 
<br>
<p>In the long run the only way of handling the organ shortage is
<br>
artificial implants, xenografts or tissue engineering. In a way the
<br>
organ shortage is speeding the development of these technologies (which
<br>
have other benefits from a transhumanist point of view). In an organ
<br>
market of course they would be substitutes, and if the price of
<br>
transplant reached their equilibrium level there might be more
<br>
profitability in developing substitutes.
