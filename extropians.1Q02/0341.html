<em>&gt; I'm not convinced that any project is so intrinsically hard that you can't

</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.
</em><br>
<p>The key word is &quot;comparatively&quot; rapid.  I can think of comparatively rapid
<br>
routes to spinoffs; I cannot think of routes that are absolutely rapid,
<br>
i.e. rapid by comparison with an average programming project.
<br>
<p>There's plenty that can be got out of real AI development, so long as it
<br>
is real AI and not something else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How long did Cyg take to get to a point of being saleable? You could, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sake of argument, view that as an attempt at a first step (i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing the database) in a much longer ongoing project.
</em><br>
<p>Cyg, or Cyc?  I don't recall offhand an AI project named Cyg.  And Cyc is
<br>
not exactly the best example you could pick to make your case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should all be trying to get Flare slashdotted, by the way :) Some more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention couldn't hurt.
</em><br>
<p>I think the current thought was that we wanted a prototype or a whitepaper
<br>
before we tried to get Flare slashdotted.  Right now we need coding
<br>
volunteers, but we definitely don't need to use up our shot at Slashdot
<br>
while the project is still revving up - the attention would probably do
<br>
more harm than good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, no matter how good an idea I have for a for-profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corporation, it still isn't going to have better than a fifty percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of success, because the ordinary failure rate for startups is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ninety-five percent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say it has a 95% chance of failure. If there's one thing that my time in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Bay Area has taught me, it's that how good you are, how good your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products are, whether or not you have the Best Idea; none of these matter a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damn. The success or failure of your company is largely out of your hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lies in the variables over which you have no control.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, pretty much.  I don't think that *all* the variables are out of
<br>
control, just a heck of a lot of them, so I do think it's possible to
<br>
increase the chances somewhat.  But for the record, I don't have any
<br>
specific idea that I would regard as giving a company a fifty-percent
<br>
chance of success; I was trying to quantify a theoretical maximum.
