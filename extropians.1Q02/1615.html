From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20We're%20stuck%20with%20each%20other">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not really.  With sufficiently robust MNT money to &quot;survive&quot; is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.  Humans are 100W machines (the brain itself only ~15W.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Typical solar insolation is ~200-400W per sq. m.   Allowing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversion efficiency issues, a human can &quot;survive&quot; on only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few sq. m of land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll state this quite clearly and keep repeating it until people get it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With robust MNT &quot;survival&quot; *IS NOT A PROBLEM*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't recognize the term &quot;MNT&quot; so I may be missing your point.  However,
<br>
just keeping the brain alive would be like &quot;survival&quot; in a jar.  Most people
<br>
would also want an internet conneciton, and that would cost money.
<br>
<p>There is also the problem with maintenance.  You don't really expect any
<br>
computer left in an unoccupied building to remain running (or even present)
<br>
after a few years?  You would need security and maintenance people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The first uploads and maintained will probably be expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  It will be expensive to develop the first upload.  But once
</em><br>
developed
<br>
<em>&gt; making it available to large numbers of people should not take more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few years.
</em><br>
<p>Look at how expensive VCR's and CD's were.  Look at how many decades it took
<br>
to be available to the public at all, let alone at a reasonable price.  Why
<br>
do you expect uploading to be any different?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There will be cases of people stealing storage nodes so they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; delete the previous occupant and upload themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might need 3 Drexlerian nanocomputers per &quot;mind&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I don't see any need to postulate a need to steal energy or hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from others unless it turns out that that to properly support a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind you have to drop down to the level of a full molecular dynamics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation at the atomic level.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  More than half the people in the US and over 90% of the world can't
<br>
even afford a PC-style computer.  Why do you think they will be able to
<br>
afford 3 Drexlerian nanocomputers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It will cost money to be stored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  You have your nanoreplicators build you a space ship and send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself into orbit around the sun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It doesn't cost anything other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the materials required for the original investment in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computronium and space ship.  (Obviously space ships for 1 cm^3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanocomputers can be pretty small...).
</em><br>
<p>It costs millions to put something into Earth orbit.  I don't even know if a
<br>
private citizen CAN put something in orbit around the sun.  How can you
<br>
object to &quot;It will cost money&quot; and then reply &quot;send yourself into orbit
<br>
around he sun&quot;.  That's even more money than maintenance on earth would
<br>
cost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You make money in the virtual world.  The real world is so slow and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind the times that dealing with it will be pretty undesirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But since you are living off &quot;free&quot; energy, you don't need money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless there is a market where you want to buy closed-source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designs for self-enhancement.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to know where you get this &quot;free&quot; energy.  I could use it now, even
<br>
before I upload.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are an uploaded copy on a spaceship orbiting the sun you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really have to worry about whether the laws of some enclave &quot;grant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you rights&quot;.  You only have to worry whether some enclave will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action to destroy you.
</em><br>
<p>If I could afford to put myself off of the earth, then yes, I wouldn't have
<br>
to worry about what earth laws say.  Unfortunately, I am not that wealthy
<br>
(yet).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For &quot;uploading&quot; to really work people are going to have to accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that &quot;you&quot; are really in the machine.  You would obviously pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Turing Test (as poor as it is).
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  However, that definitely will be one of the first hurdles.
