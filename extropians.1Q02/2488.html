That matter influences light is an obvious fact - 
<br>
if it were not so, we could not see objects. 
<br>
The influence of light on matter is, however, 
<br>
a more subtle effect .....

<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; In order for the eye to be able to focus an image on the retina, 
<br>
the axial length of the eye needs to be just right. If the eye is too 
<br>
long (or too short), then the image is perpetually focused in front 
<br>
of the retina (or behind it). The result is nearsightedness (or 
<br>
farsightedness). It turns out that the retina of the eye plays a big 
<br>
role in making sure that the axial length of the eye is just right. 
<br>
How? Well, the retina has the ability to determine whether an image 
<br>
is &quot;in focus&quot; or &quot;out of focus.&quot; If an image is &quot;out of focus&quot; then 
<br>
the retina emits chemical signals that control the growth of the eye, 
<br>
making it either longer or shorter, as needed, so that the image can 
<br>
be focused properly.
<br>
But there's a big unanswered question: How does the retina determine 
<br>
whether an image is &quot;in focus&quot; or not? The obvious answer is that an 
<br>
image that's &quot;in focus&quot; is clear and has sharp edges, while an &quot;out 
<br>
of focus&quot; image is blurry. So one idea is that the retina can 
<br>
distinguish between &quot;fuzzy&quot; and &quot;not fuzzy.&quot; But the photoreceptor 
<br>
cells (the cells that directly absorb the photons) cannot do this by 
<br>
themselves. Instead, a little bit of image processing is required. 
<br>
The photoreceptor cells synapse onto bipolar cells, and these synapse 
<br>
onto retinal ganglion cells. A single ganglion cell receives input 
<br>
from multiple photoreceptor cells. One function of ganglion cells is 
<br>
in &quot;edge detection.&quot; An edge is defined as a sharp boundary 
<br>
between &quot;light on&quot; and &quot;light off.&quot; So if the ganglion cells detect 
<br>
lots of sharp edges, then they might be able to conclude that an 
<br>
image is focused on the retina. 
<br>
The problem with the above hypothesis is that the ganglion cells 
<br>
appear *not* to be involved with the ability of the retina to 
<br>
determine whether an image is in focus. That is, if you kill off the 
<br>
ganglion cells (while keeping the photoreceptor cells intact), then 
<br>
the retina is *still* able to guide the development of the eye in 
<br>
such a way as to maintain the proper axial length. The experimental 
<br>
evidence is still a little bit sketchy, iiuc; but an argument can be 
<br>
made that the photoreceptor cells, all by themselves, can determine 
<br>
whether an image is focused or not on the retina. And as far as I 
<br>
know, there's no way to explain, in classical terms, how that might 
<br>
work. &gt;&gt;
