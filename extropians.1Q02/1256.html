</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, I think rational design and goal-oriented action will play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a much bigger role than survival-of-the-fittest kind of evolution in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governing how SIs change over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The first rule here is that we have no way to predict anything about the
<br>
behavior of SIs.  If we did, there would be no 'S' in there.
<br>
<p>We are mostly defined by our limitations.  We have to have air and water and
<br>
food and warmth and gravity and pressure and all kinds of psychological
<br>
connections.  Our cells break down with time, and our self repair systems do
<br>
not regenerate all kinds of things we would like to have made new.  But our
<br>
biggest limitation, up until now, is that we could not go in and mess with our
<br>
own source code.
<br>
<p>Although we do not know what SIs will be like, we can take a good guess that
<br>
they will be in control of their own designs.  This may mean that SIs are
<br>
inherently unstable.  It may turn out that the goal-oriented action of making
<br>
modifications to oneself (so as to blow off limitations) is so addictive that
<br>
once you can do it, you must do it.  If so, the opportunity for runaway
<br>
feedback loops will be legion.
<br>
<p>Again, guessing, one would expect that your typical SI would be interested in
<br>
knowing more about how the Universe works.  If over a period of, perhaps, a
<br>
long time some major discoveries are made, it is almost sure to be possible
<br>
for the SI to use this knowledge to add new capabilities to itself.  It is
<br>
hard to believe that the SI will decide to just &quot;Stay happy the way I am&quot; (SI
<br>
Zen Masters notwithstanding).  Would you?
