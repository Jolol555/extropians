<p>
<em>&gt; And it didn't actually take you to sites you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to go to (as he continually claimed but failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually demonstrate).  It DID give you choices in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition to (not instead of) what the designer of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site gave you.  Ones the designer didn't intend.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't &quot;link hijacking&quot;... no links were redirected,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just new ones created and additional choices added to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing links.
</em><br>
<p>I humbly disagree.  A link is supposed to do what the HTML says to do.  If I
<br>
put a link on my website to bring up my resume, that is what I want it to
<br>
do.  If it brings up an ad for monster.com or lists other resumes that you
<br>
ought to look at instead of mine, I would call that link hijacking.  I am
<br>
the author of the link, and instead of bringing up my intended content, this
<br>
software inserts some other content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once I saw what TopText was, I didn't want it and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had no problem at all uninstalling it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And THAT is how it should be... if a program isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful to me, I simply don't use it.  TopText and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other similar programs do not add any functionality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I want.  I do NOT, however, think that it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently unethical program... just a useless one.
</em><br>
<p>Wasn't it unethical for it to install itself without your knowledge?  You
<br>
shouldn't have software sneak on your computer that you don't know about.
<br>
You shouldn't have to uninstall software that you never wanted in the first
<br>
place.  If I snuck into your house at night and installed software I had
<br>
written, you would probably have me arrested.
<br>
<p>I have no problems with the functionality of this product if somebody wants
<br>
this service.  I do have problems with products that hide what they do.  I
<br>
call that fraud.  I have problems with products that purport to install one
<br>
thing, but are really intended to install something else.  That's called a
<br>
trojan horse.  I also have problems to software that piggybacks onto other
<br>
software you run and then secretly installs itself to your computer and
<br>
quietly remains even after the original software is deleted.  That's called
<br>
a virus.  If a hacker wrote a program to do these things, they would be
<br>
arrested and put in jail for it.
