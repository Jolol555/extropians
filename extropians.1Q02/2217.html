</em><br>
<p>I see three flaws with this scenario.
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
<p>The first is the assumption that your uploaded self will be faster.  People
<br>
always quote the speed of electricity vs. the speed of neurons, but they
<br>
fail to take into account the paralell processing that goes on in the human
<br>
brain.  Just as a far-fetched example, if I uploaded a person into an Excel
<br>
spreadsheet, each variable change would take seconds (minutes? hours?) to
<br>
recalculate the entire spreadsheet.  Such an upload would be horribly SLOW
<br>
compared to flesh and blood.
<br>
<p>Eventually, they will fix this.  They will make processors and
<br>
multiprocessor systems faster.  They question is will people use them?  Once
<br>
you are speeded up to normal, would you want to speed up faster?  Before
<br>
everyone jumps in to say yes, ask yourself why?  If you can already
<br>
communicate to the uploaded people quite fine, who would be the first to
<br>
want to go faster?  All that would happen is that everyone else (uploaded
<br>
and not) would be boringly slow to you.  You, yourself would not feel any
<br>
difference.  So, who would spend time and effort to do it?
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
<p>The second flaw is sheer boredom.  Even if the technology makes you faster,
<br>
how many people have the focus to think about something for a  month at a
<br>
time?  I see no reason to believe that the uploaded month of thinking would
<br>
be much more productive than the flesh and blood month of thinking.
<br>
<p>3)
<br>
<p>The third flaw is economics.  Even if you have a fast upload, and a mind
<br>
focused enough to think about something for a month at a time, why would
<br>
they?  Today, companies pay people money.  Without money people can't get
<br>
food.  How many people, if they didn't need food or shelter, would work for
<br>
someone else instread of on their own ideas?  I don't think uploaded people
<br>
would care enough.  (They might care about cancer, or something, but those
<br>
issues have been thought out enough that just sitting and thinking won't
<br>
help those issues.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You do not interact meaningfully with a statue-littered landscape. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;means other than bulldozering it, I mean.
</em><br>
<p>Luckily, I don't think uploads would spend the effort to bulldoze the
<br>
statues.  Even if this situation comes about, the statues wouldn't have any
<br>
affect to the uploaded so why would they bother to bulldoze them?
<br>
