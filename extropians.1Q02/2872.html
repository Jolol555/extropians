apparently don't want it. AMD is losing credibility with the user base

right now, though, because it doesn't offer thermal protection. A naked

AMD CPU would self-destruct in less than a second.

<p>Copper and diamond heat spreaders should be there quite soon, and advent

of liquid cooling is unavoidable. Voltage and structure shrink still gives
<br>
us some headway, but current designs are rapidly getting uncomfortably

hot. Asynchronous designs and power saving should do better, and even
<br>
reversible logic in semiconductors, eventually.

<p>Latter is a must for computronium, of course.
