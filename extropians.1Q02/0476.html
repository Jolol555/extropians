</em><br>
<p>Ok, lets for the sake of the discussion assume every human
<br>
is granted the fundamental human rights outlined in the U.N.
<br>
treaty on human rights.  Lets assume one is also granted an equal
<br>
right to an equivalent share of the energy and material resources on
<br>
the Earth.  So every human in their current form can survive
<br>
and live a happy life.
<br>
<p>Problem #1: Each additional human born is going to be taking
<br>
away from your &quot;fair&quot; share.  Solutions: (a) accept the situation
<br>
until your resources are depleted to the point where you can
<br>
no longer survive; (b) enact a ban on reproduction (which I
<br>
expect violates something in the U.N. treaty).
<br>
<p>Problem #2: How do you allocate *future* resources that become
<br>
available?  If I invest my time, energy and capital and then
<br>
go risk my neck to stake a claim on Ceres, making it my own
<br>
personal island in the solar system, and then reproduction
<br>
is allowed to continue until humanity reaches the carrying
<br>
capacity of the solar system -- does &quot;humanity&quot; have the
<br>
right to take Ceres from me and reallocate it to the people
<br>
who sat on their lazy butts watching TV for the next century?
<br>
<p>Its a fundamental question -- when do &quot;fundamental&quot; human rights
<br>
trump property rights?  One almost has to laugh at Fukuyama arguing
<br>
for human &quot;dignity&quot; and preventing human cloning when 20 million
<br>
people a year die of hunger and starvation.  Or probably more
<br>
who will die from HIV infections.  Lets address the *real* problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Precisely what does &quot;contributing&quot; mean?  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose judgment and by what criteria is this to be evaluated? 
</em><br>
<p>That is why I raised the point.  Evaluation of contributions
<br>
seems likely to be quite subjective.  Of course one could &quot;vote&quot;
<br>
on contributions -- everyone gets 5 votes to cast any way they
<br>
like (boy would we all become political then).  Or we could
<br>
setup a system where the votes are weighted by perceived
<br>
contributions -- i.e. your votes count for more if you are
<br>
perceived by your peers as contributing more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can it be evaluated for instance by whether or not enough people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care enough for something one has or has produced or does to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offer to pay sufficiently for it for those payments to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchanged for the necessities and desires of the individual? 
</em><br>
<p>I was thinking more along extropic lines -- one defines some
<br>
system of evaluating the degree to which one contributed to
<br>
complexification -- one could normalize say art and science
<br>
so even though they are working in quite different directions,
<br>
equivalent &quot;contributions&quot; were valued equally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What of those who are outside of the current envelope of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people find valuable enough to pay for?
</em><br>
<p>One would have to have a scheme that valued novelty as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many intensely creative and brilliant souls out there who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot find anyone that will actually pay them for what they consider most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to do.  Should these be considered to be &quot;not contributing&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, now this is an interesting question.  One would suppose that
<br>
&quot;humanity&quot; wants &quot;useful&quot; stuff -- i.e. stuff that serves to
<br>
uplift humanity over time (increasing productivity, providing
<br>
greater entertainment, etc.).  But we know of artists that never
<br>
became &quot;great&quot; until well after they died.
<br>
<p>Being &quot;paid&quot; really isn't an issue -- everyone is in non-survival
<br>
mode.  If we assume everyone has uploaded, then what might happen
<br>
is you get allocated time slices in the computronium matrix in
<br>
relation to your &quot;perceived&quot; contribution.  No contribution and
<br>
your &quot;mind&quot; only gets to run once in a blue moon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or is the society actually likely to be much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; richer when people have the &quot;luxury&quot; of picking what they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most passionate at and pursuing that without their very survival 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being at stake if they don't choose something they can charge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else a price for sharing?
</em><br>
<p>*Or* will society become stale and lethargic when people are no
<br>
longer motivated by the needs of survival?  (Remember -- you
<br>
have the fundamental right to &quot;exist&quot; (as a human) -- whether
<br>
you have a fundamental right to an &quot;equal share&quot; of the expanded
<br>
resources and technologies in the solar system is what I'm trying
<br>
to address here.  (For example, I believe there is wording in
<br>
U.N. treaties regarding &quot;space&quot; and &quot;international waters&quot; that
<br>
suggests that every human is entitled to their &quot;fair share&quot; of
<br>
these resources -- no matter who develops them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As as been mentioned on this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several times, that is only one of many ways a posthuman culture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be organized and it is increasingly less likely, or at any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate less necessary, as the society moves from  one of assumed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity to assumed abundance.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Perhaps what I didn't make clear was my interest
<br>
in addressing the end-point conditions, rather than the
<br>
transition conditions.  The entire period of colonization
<br>
of the Americas was a transition period -- you discovered/claimed
<br>
and developed physical resources as you were able.  Now that period
<br>
is largely ended.  One can view the world today as one where
<br>
the non-expanding physical resources must be allocated to an
<br>
expanding number of people.  (I'm ignoring the fact that
<br>
substitutions and technology development are currently
<br>
masking the severity of the situation).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it is a truly abundant society with few space/resource constraints I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see that this is an issue as far as actualy physical drain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the society goes.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps some of the Europeans on the list might want to comment
<br>
on the issue of the physical drain on society posed by &quot;deadwood&quot;...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One answer to this is to not have so much (if any) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central authority.
</em><br>
<p>True, but what happens if the entire 50 billion people on Earth vote
<br>
to take Ceres from me by &quot;eminent domain&quot;?  No central authority
<br>
but I still end up losing most likely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another answer is some form of competency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing on voters and perhaps weighing of votes.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, well I see we may have reached similar conclusions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Overall, I see no good reason why one's survival should be tied 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;contributing&quot; to society in an extropian worldview.  Such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criteria of &quot;contributing&quot; smacks of one's worth depending on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasing others.  It goes against the grain.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that its unnecessary during the periods when we will
<br>
be developing uses for very underutilized resources.  Its
<br>
a question primarily for periods when those resources are being
<br>
substantially stretched -- like the Earth now (until we
<br>
expand the technology envelope) or the solar system in
<br>
a few hundred to a few thousand years.
