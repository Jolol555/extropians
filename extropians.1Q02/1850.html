Speaking off the top of my head this points to the natural functionality invasive, aggressive cancers show.
<br>
It points towards the ability for humans who live very long if not indefinite lifespans being able to still
<br>
evolve as a species by continual replacement of tissue with stem cell therapies.  The only organ for which
<br>
this still seems a possible problem would be the brain.  I suspect that unless an intenal lateral
<br>
uploading-sideloading of neural information including memory/personality structure/function is maintained
<br>
through the regenerative processes there may still be still some tough problems to solve.  Way to go for
<br>
those down in the trenches in this area.

<em>&gt; John, you need to spend a little more time browsing through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PubMed to *educate* yourself.  The evidence that adults probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry totipotent stem cells has been accumulating for several years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example the date on:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11486730&amp;dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11486730&amp;dopt=Abstract</a></em><br>
<em>&gt; is *March 2001* and its a *review* article meaning that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been accumulating evidence for quite some time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would love to see a way around the controversy of using aborted baby tissues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Embryonic stem cells are *not* produced from anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be *remotely* considered a baby.  I strongly suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the time an embryo begins to remotely take on a human form,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the cells have lost all ability to be &quot;totipotent&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I don't believe that any of the current embryonic stem cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines were produced from aborted tissue at all!  I believe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were manufactured in the lab directly from fertilized eggs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll agree that the article is good news, since the results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be quite reproducible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you *missed* the most interesting part of the article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, Verfaillie's group has done the tests that are perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the gold standard in assessing a cell's plasticity. She placed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; single MAPCs from humans and mice into very early mouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; embryos, when they are just a ball of cells. Analyses of mice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; born after the experiment reveal that a single MAPC can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contribute to all the body's tissues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this is written accurately, then it means that human-mouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimeras have been produced.  Now *that* I find interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I was unaware of it.  But thinking about it, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to me that someone must have done this before.  Does anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how far you can push it (10:1, 5:1, 1:1 Mouse:Human ratio)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what happens when you do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
