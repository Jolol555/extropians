<em>&gt;&gt; Yup, read it twice.  However, it's been quite a while since my last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reading, before the movie came out.  My recollection (admittedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; flawed on occasion) is the book didn't deal with sexual integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at all.  No shower scenes that I can remember.  Maybe I'm wrong, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think the fully integrated showers was a Paul Verhoeven creation.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm pretty sure the integrated shower scene was inspired by Joe Haldeman's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Forever War&quot;, not &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, the book.
</em><br>
<p>Almost nothing in the ST movie was inspired by the Heinlein book
<br>
except the title, the character names, and a few points of the plot.
<br>
Besides that, it was a complete hatchet job that Heinlein would
<br>
never had approved of if he had been alive.  This should not be
<br>
too surprizing, since its director (Paul Verhoeven) has repeatedly
<br>
shown himself to be the very archetype of a hollywood &quot;player&quot;
<br>
totally without scruples.  I'm sure he promised Heinlein's heirs
<br>
that he would be true to Heinlein's story while he was advising
<br>
his lawyers to make sure the contract would protect him from suit
<br>
when he didn't.
