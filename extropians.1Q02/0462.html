<p><p>If you are going to play with such extreme conspiracy notions 
<br>
then I think the purpose could be very different than the above 
<br>
quite limited objective.  The above is not sufficient for such a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;horrendous act with such nasty repurcussions.  What just might 
<br>
be in the minds of some bureaucrats and military people is 
<br>
creating an open season on groups they have any problem with 
<br>
whatsoever and, more importantly, being able to partially 
<br>
control and de-fang some of the engines of major technological 
<br>
change that threaten their own empires.  See, I think sometimes 
<br>
in my paranoia that some very powerful people took it seriously 
<br>
when some of us talked about cyber-anarchy, the end of 
<br>
government as a major power center and many other threatening 
<br>
notions up to and including Singularity.
<br>
<p>Whether you buy conspriracy notions or not it is obvious that 
<br>
the government has gained unprecedented control to push through 
<br>
various forms of legislation including that calling many things 
<br>
&quot;terrorism&quot; that have to do with, say, people doing things with 
<br>
computers that they don't like.  Many lines of research and many 
<br>
data banks can be closed down and restricted because they might 
<br>
be used by &quot;terrorists&quot;.  Any group can be accused of aiding 
<br>
terrorists and be shut down and have its assets seized with 
<br>
little or no legal red-tape.  All of us can be spied upon and 
<br>
black-bagged to the givernment's content with little or no 
<br>
oversight.
<br>
<p><p>I think the target, in any case, is US.
