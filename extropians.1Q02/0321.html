<p>
Implosion and explosion of a Bose-Einstein condensate &quot;Bosenova&quot;
<br>
<p>In a Bose-Einstein condensate, virtually all the atoms in the ultra-cold 
<br>
gas fall into the lowest-energy quantum mechanical state. 
<br>
Spread out in space, they become superimposed on one another, 
<br>
each indistinguishable from the other, creating what has been called 
<br>
a &quot;superatom.&quot; In quantum-dynamic terms, the same &quot;wave function&quot; 
<br>
describes them all.
<br>
<p>By making a Bose-Einstein condensate in a particular isotope 
<br>
-- rubidium-85 -- and then changing the magnetic field in which the 
<br>
BEC is sitting, researchers can adjust the wavefunction's self-interaction 
<br>
between repulsion and attraction. If the self-interaction is repulsive, 
<br>
all the parts of the wavefunction push each other away. If it is attractive, 
<br>
they all pull towards each other, like gravity. Achieving a pure BEC 
<br>
in rubidium-85 required the cloud of atoms to be cooled to about 
<br>
3 billionths of a degree above absolute zero, the lowest temperature 
<br>
ever achieved.
<br>
<p>Making the self-interaction mildly repulsive causes the condensate 
<br>
to swell up in a controlled manner, as predicted by theory. However, 
<br>
when the magnetic field is adjusted to make the interaction attractive, 
<br>
dramatic and very unexpected effects are observed.
<br>
<p>The condensate first shrinks as expected, but rather than gradually 
<br>
clumping together in a mass, there is instead a sudden explosion of 
<br>
atoms outward. This &quot;explosion,&quot; which actually corresponds to a tiny 
<br>
amount of energy by normal standards, continues for a few thousandths 
<br>
of a second. Left behind is a small cold remnant condensate surrounded 
<br>
by the expanding gas of the explosion. About half the original atoms in the 
<br>
condensate seem to have vanished in that they are not seen in either 
<br>
the remnant or the expanding gas cloud.
<br>
<p>Since the phenomenon looks very much like a tiny supernova, or exploding 
<br>
star, the JILA team dubbed it a &quot;Bosenova.&quot; The most surprising thing about 
<br>
the Bosenova is that the fundamental physical process behind the explosion 
<br>
is still a mystery.

<br>
<p>[The `'collapse' phenomenon in a (non-ideal) BEC with attractive
<br>
forces is nonlinear, and nonperturbative. However, approximations
<br>
(Gross-Pitaevskii eq.) coupled with numerical analysis
<br>
techniques give some qualitative explication of what is going on]
