<p>
Regarding my statement: &quot;The government has spent thirty years and 
<br>
millions of dollars looking for evidence to support its 
<br>
&quot;cyclist-inferiority&quot; hypothesis on which practically all of its bicycle 
<br>
transportation program is based,&quot; Jim Lund replied: &quot;I didn't realize that 
<br>
a US federal 'bicycle transportation program' existed, and can't guess what 
<br>
it is.  I just ride my bike...&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has an official bicycle transportation 
<br>
policy. Its official goals are to double the number of trips made by 
<br>
bicycle while reducing the number of accidents by 10%. Whoever wrote this 
<br>
did not realize that this meant that the accident rate per trip had to be 
<br>
only 55% of its original value, a reduction of 45% in the accident rate, a 
<br>
fantastic achievement if it could be achieved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method adopted to achieve these goals is building bikeways 
<br>
everywhere. The casual thinker concludes that this is a good thing; 
<br>
separating bikes from cars means that there won't be any accidents, or at 
<br>
most very few. Consider the following facts. Bikeways are intended to 
<br>
protect cyclists from same-direction motor traffic. Car-bike collisions [to 
<br>
use a short phrase] constitute only about 12% of accidents to cyclists. 
<br>
Under urban daylight conditions, only about 2% of car-bike collisions are 
<br>
of the straight-ahead motorist, straight-ahead cyclist type. About 95% of 
<br>
urban, daylight car-bike collisions involve turning or crossing movements. 
<br>
On any urban journey from A to B, the cyclist has to cross all the traffic 
<br>
traveling through the gap between A and B. As long as all traffic is on one 
<br>
level, say ground level, it doesn't matter at all what kind of bikeway the 
<br>
cyclist uses; he still has to cross over that traffic. Bikeways do not 
<br>
provide any protection against that traffic. Indeed, midblock road 
<br>
crossings of bike paths are more dangerous than crossing the road at normal 
<br>
intersections. Bikeways alongside the roadway, which is the only generally 
<br>
available urban space, require both cyclist and motorist, when either is 
<br>
turning, to operate contrary to the normal operating procedures, in ways 
<br>
that require much greater care and much more time to ascertain whether or 
<br>
not the movement can be made in safety. In short, the government's bikeway 
<br>
program hasn't a hope in hell of reducing accidents to cyclists, and is 
<br>
more likely to increase the accident rate than decrease it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bikeway program was originally cooked up by motorists to clear 
<br>
the roads of bicycle traffic, thus avoiding both delays to motorists and 
<br>
the concern that they would have to look out for bicycles. Of course, that 
<br>
motive wouldn't be politically acceptable, so it was sold as &quot;bike safety&quot;, 
<br>
without any analysis of its actual probable results. Motorists had also 
<br>
cooked up the similar &quot;bike safety&quot; training for children, teaching them 
<br>
that the greatest sin is to get in the way of a car, and the wages of sin 
<br>
is death. So we have a population of people who are ignorant of cycling but 
<br>
who believe, with quasi-religious fervor, that bikeways must make cycling 
<br>
safe for untrained bicycle riders. If that were all, the bikeway program 
<br>
would have been beaten decades ago. Now the environmentalists [a name 
<br>
encompassing several viewpoints] jump on the bandwagon and make it really 
<br>
popular. These environmentalists hate and fear motoring. So what do they 
<br>
do? They apply all of their effort to advocating the program that the 
<br>
motorists had cooked up for their own convenience, the bikeway program, in 
<br>
the belief that the mass of the population is so frightened of motor 
<br>
traffic that they will bicycle only if bikeways are provided to relieve 
<br>
their fear, and the corresponding belief that masses of people will 
<br>
transfer from motoring to bicycling if only their fear is relieved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, those cyclists who obey the rules of the road for drivers 
<br>
of vehicles have a much lower accident rate than those who don't (cycling 
<br>
club members, more likely to operate in the vehicular manner, have an 
<br>
accident rate only about 25% of that for the general population), and find 
<br>
themselves able to take direct, fast routes for all the trips that they 
<br>
desire. With more convenience and lower accident rate, one would expect 
<br>
that the proper governmental policy would be to promote the kind of cycling 
<br>
that best combines convenience and safety, in the belief that that would 
<br>
attract the optimum amount of bicycle transportation. Instead, governmental 
<br>
practice discourages that kind of cycling; we have to fight every year  to 
<br>
maintain our rights to operate in the lawfully required, safe and 
<br>
convenient manner.
