</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Clearly, from the perspective of an SI, it must be far easier to alter a dog

</em><br>

<p>I suspect that SIs would find &quot;treating&quot; us at all as irrelevant to their 
<br>
purposes and would tend to ignore us.  This issue, however, arises in terms 
<br>
of UFO abductions.  My theory (the *very* short version) is that the UFOs 
<br>
are the results of a pre-human civilization that arose on this planet some 
<br>
time (long or short) before humans did, which discovered nanotech, had 
<br>
their Singularity, and now basically do whatever they want with only 
<br>
occasionally having to interfere with humans who get in the way.  In such 
<br>
cases, I suspect they take total control of the human's brain, implant a 
<br>
lot of &quot;alien medical experiment&quot; nonsense suitable for our primitive 
<br>
social notions of alien contact, and go about their business while the 
<br>
human sleeps it off.  A recent discussion on this list about invading 
<br>
nanobots had some relevance here - I need to review that discussion at some 
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>In short, I don't think SIs will have anything significant to do with us, 
<br>
and if they do, it will be entirely on their terms, not ours.  As Vinge 
<br>
said once, if you come away from a conversation with superhuman 
<br>
intelligence thinking you know what''s what, you have been sold a bill of 
<br>
goods... Needless to say, I also think such SIs will have no truck with 
<br>
conventional notions of ethics, morality or &quot;rights&quot; which are relevant 
<br>
only to humans (if then)...
