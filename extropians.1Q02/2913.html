</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imperialism, as an ideology, did survive the Great War. Moreover, one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that its ideological underpinnings were strengthened by the downfall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Dual Monarchy, Germany, Russia and the Ottomans. Countries during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interwar period who wished to overturn the Versailles treaty settlement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewed the expansion of their power in territorial and inperialistic terms:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; German lebensraum, Italy in Abyssinia, Japan and Manchukuo. Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governmental ideologies incorporated the dynamic of imperialism and married
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to new racial and national extremes.
</em><br>
<p>Well, no, and yes. WWI was initially a war between empires. WWII was a
<br>
war between empire builders and democracy builders. The British Empire
<br>
was on the ropes through the 1920's and 30's, as was the French. Germany
<br>
lost its colonies entirely and AustroHungary was broken up entirely at
<br>
Versailles. The British only kept India through WWII by promising to
<br>
grant independence after the war. Italy, well, Italy, quitely plainly,
<br>
was a joke as far as imperialists go. The Ottomans fell after WWI as
<br>
well. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The British and French empires remained in existence at this time, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remained symbols of national strength for their electorates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anti-imperialistic arguments in Europe were mainly derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marxist-Leninist theory and never gained much credence beyond the Left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imperialism in Britain eventually lost its ideological grip with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atlantic Charter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps imperialism did lose its ideological hold upon the US under Wilson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the Versailles Treaty and its principle of self-determination had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle with the long-standing notions of racial and cultural superiority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that justified empire.
</em><br>
<p>THis is not really that accurate. Wilson's ideas gained quite a wide
<br>
public acceptance throughout Europe after the war, it was really only
<br>
the aristocrats who resented the implications.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Countries would not go to war against each other if one side or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other were not lying about their point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you wish to view a war in terms of the ideologies expressed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; participants, how do you distinguish between their ideas and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; created in support of their point of view? snip...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Propaganda, per se, is not always a lie. There are two forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; propaganda: information and disinformation. One is truth, the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; falsehood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Propaganda is always a form of untruth as the authors wish the reader or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer to privelege a particular interpretation. The author is hoping that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their work is structured in such a way that it will make your mind up for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.
</em><br>
<p>But nothing you say here demonstrates that all interpretations are
<br>
untruths. If even on interpretation is accurate, then propaganda for
<br>
that point of view is not an untruth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Studies of British propaganda during WWII found that it was not possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modify deeply held attitudes but that you could reinforce and exacerbate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preexisting attitudes.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, stunning defeats are quite effective at making people
<br>
reevaluate their assumptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes. However, nationalism being wrong and false does not mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything it involves is automatically false (just as a KKK member can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still tell the truth when he says the sky is blue). Objectively ranking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one form of polity as objectively better than another is significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different from having blind faith in one's nation, right or wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The terms 'false' and 'wrong' are only applicable if you wish to view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history as a conflict between rationalism and irrationalism (which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include your definition of faith). However, it is not possible for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationalist to set down objective criteria in order to assess nations, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; s/he develops an exaggerated sense of belonging to their own nation through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentiment and/or loyalty. This is not a statement saying that the objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ranking of polities is impossible but that one has to reflect on these views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and discount them before attempting suvh an assessment.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, the individual should decide first what sort of country
<br>
they think, according to facts of human nature, would be the best to
<br>
live and prosper in, then see what countries match up best to those
<br>
criteria.
