<p>
Argument For Autism as a Genetic 'Epidemic' 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have the airplane and the computer changed the architecture of the 
<br>
mind? And is that why autism is on the increase?&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>By Simon Baron-Cohen 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with autism can be affected to varying degrees, but their 
<br>
principal mental characteristics are that they have difficulty in fitting in 
<br>
with other people or figuring out people's feelings and perspectives (a 
<br>
disability) whilst they have a natural flair for analysing the non-social 
<br>
world in fine detail, and in understanding non-social systems (a talent). So 
<br>
whilst they may appear socially odd to their peer-group within their own 
<br>
culture, their long hours focused on understanding a system like mathematics 
<br>
or calendars, car engines or music, navigation or computer-programming, 
<br>
grammar and vocabulary, can lead them to high levels of expertise within 
<br>
narrow domains of knowledge. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with autism are usually male, and these men would traditionally 
<br>
have not competed well in the competition for mates, as appearing socially 
<br>
odd might have either put off prospective females from choosing them, or put 
<br>
off prospective parents-in-law from arranging such a marriage for their 
<br>
daughters. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then two massive changes hit the planet: the airplane and the 
<br>
computer. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airplane has allowed unprecedented opportunities for changing your 
<br>
culture. And when you go from your native culture into another one, your 
<br>
social oddness may be far less obvious. &quot;Oh, he behaves like that because 
<br>
he's English&quot;, a Brazilian might say, or vice-versa. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social oddity can be minimised to some extent by moving cultures 
<br>
because we are all experts in knowing the subtle body language and 
<br>
intonation of our own cultures but might just mistakenly assume that a 
<br>
foreigner's different body language or intonation is due to their different 
<br>
culture. We might overlook what to people in their culture would appear odd 
<br>
and off-putting. So someone with autism might find it far easier to be 
<br>
accepted, even by the opposite sex, when they are abroad, compared to when 
<br>
they are in their native country. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer has penetrated every work-place. In just 50 short years, 
<br>
there is now no office in the developed world where computers are not 
<br>
essential, and we need those people with the cool, razor-sharp logic to fix 
<br>
them, reconfigure them, develop them, adapt them, program them. The autistic 
<br>
mind was sitting around for centuries, even millennia, under-employed, 
<br>
because how many jobs were there for mathematicians and scientists, who also 
<br>
needed this style of thinking? Drops in the ocean. And then the market 
<br>
opened up for computer-scientists - the most in-demand of workers in the 
<br>
modern age. Tidal waves in the ocean. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer-scientists, irrespective of their social skills, could now 
<br>
hop on a plane and find a job, get rich, and have something to offer a girl: 
<br>
social status, a salary, a niche in which they fit, and even be accepted as 
<br>
normal for a foreigner - for who of us can judge what is normal for a 
<br>
foreigner? Or even if they just stayed in their own culture, they were now 
<br>
more valued and accepted than before. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that all computer-scientists lack social skill. Far 
<br>
from it. We all know computer-scientists who are good socializers. Nor is it 
<br>
to say that those severely affected by autism could suddenly shift and 
<br>
become a successful programmer. But those who had a dash of autism could. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer the socially isolated, unemployed, &quot;weird&quot; guy who could 
<br>
list every prime number up to 10,000 in minutes, but who couldn't have even 
<br>
a semblance of a conversation with a girl at a party. Now the successful 
<br>
computer scientist, well-paid, whose talent at &quot;systemising&quot; has enabled him 
<br>
to learn a foreign language and be accepted, and even find a date and a 
<br>
mate. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autism is genetic: it runs in families. But whereas in 1970 the rate 
<br>
of autism was 4 in 10,000 people, today it is 1 in 200 people. The rate has 
<br>
gone up more than twelve-fold. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve-fold? Is this an epidemic? Some have rashly thought this might 
<br>
be because of some pollutant or even vaccine damage, but the evidence for 
<br>
this is thin. Certainly, the increase in autism is in part because of better 
<br>
detection and awareness, thanks to the tireless work of autism charities 
<br>
throughout the world. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But could it also be that this has also been a result of the most 
<br>
rapid evolutionary change to the human brain that we have witnessed? A 
<br>
recent issue of Wired Magazine in December 2001 reported that the rate of 
<br>
autism was hitting record rates in Silicon Valley, where a new evolutionary 
<br>
niche was opening up for people to fly in from around the planet, sell their 
<br>
mathematical and systemising talent, and find reproductive success which 
<br>
would otherwise have remained beyond reach. Our experimental research is 
<br>
consistent with this interpretation, and warrants further testing. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this evolutionary change is real, should we fear it? On the 
<br>
contrary, we should welcome and celebrate it. Good socializers have always 
<br>
found it easy to survive and reproduce, but we need our good systemisers 
<br>
too, for the benefit of the planet. These are the guys (men and women) who 
<br>
are going to push science and technology forward, and create our future. 
<br>
Thank Darwin that life is now a bit easier for them too.

diagnosis, psychological intervention and neuroimaging in autism. He

Spearman Medal, and the American Psychological Association's McAndless

subject of autism, including Autism: The Facts, 1993 The Maladapted Mind:

Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind (Learning, Development and Conceptual 
<br>
Change).
