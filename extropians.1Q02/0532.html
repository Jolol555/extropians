<p>Indeed, I wish I had paid more attention to your good work before writing
<br>
the essay, since you do seem to be addressing things in a very constructive
<br>
way. However I didn't see in the work of the SAIA any explicit political
<br>
viewpoint comparable to those expressed in the Extropian principles or the
<br>
WTA founding documents, so I didn't invest in studying what you were doing.
<br>
<p>Re: the millenial impulse and the Singularity. Personally I confess to
<br>
millenial inspiration and longing, and see no shame in it. It has a long
<br>
history, and is present in every culture. Atheists express it in many ways,
<br>
such as in Marxism. It is a sociological observation not an epithet.
<br>
However, among the varieties of millenial expression, the most common is the
<br>
pre-millenialist who sees the vast majority of people as the damned,
<br>
condemned to perish in the tribulations, while the elect are taken up. The
<br>
post-millenialist, among which I would place you Eliezer, believe that the
<br>
millenium can only be established by working hard to make this world the
<br>
Kingdom. This is for instance the Buddhist eschatological vision: the world
<br>
becomes rich and fruitful, living in peace, ruled by a just government,
<br>
which then withers and renounces authority when the next Buddha comes.
<br>
<p>Also, I don't think the material reality of the Singularity means that many
<br>
people are not inspired and effected by the millenial traditions when they
<br>
come to learn about Singularitarian possibilities. For instance, the reality
<br>
of nuclear war inspired many secualr and religious visions of apocalypse and
<br>
redemption. Most of apocalyptic science fiction can be read as secular
<br>
versions of End-times.
<br>
<p>Re: Extrop List politics: I understand from some of the responses I received
<br>
that I have missed a set of serious political discussions on the list that
<br>
revealed that the vocal libertarians are in fact (at least now) a minority.
<br>
I'm happy to hear libertarian views, have learned a lot from them, and
<br>
become more libertarian as a result. Its not that I don't want to hear from
<br>
libertarians, I just don't want to be flamed off by them. For instance Mike
<br>
Lorrey's response to my essay:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't you recognise who he is talking about? Anyone who thinks his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'vision' of a &quot;sexy, democratic future&quot; run by his social democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. bolshevik) ideology is a dumb idea is 'obviously' part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alleged 'neo-nazi wing' of transhumanism. Before you can send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone off to reeducation camps, you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properly identify them as members of a 'well documented'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter-revolutionary cabal.
</em><br>
<p>...this is rather typical of what I have encountered on the list in the
<br>
past.
<br>
<p>As to my discussion of neo-Nazi transhumanism, I actually cite two kooks,
<br>
not just one, and I suspect they represent a handful of others out there.
<br>
But far more important than the potential troublemaking of these Volks is
<br>
the fact the majority of people (unfairly and irrationally) hear Nazi
<br>
undertones when they first hear of the transhumanist goal of humans
<br>
transcending limitations through technology. Both because of the stigma we
<br>
face from without and the occasional threat we may face from within, I think
<br>
it is important that transhumanists establish and defend a broad liberal
<br>
democratic expression of &gt;Hist views (running from libertarian to social
<br>
democratic), and make clear that the majority of transhumanists condemn
<br>
authoritarianism and racism. That did not happen very clearly in the
<br>
go-round about the transhumanist webring I describe, and I think it needs to
<br>
happen more clearly in the future.
<br>
<p>You, and Nick Bostrom BTW, assert that Nazi transhumanism is an oxymoron.
<br>
But a central point of my essay, and a point expressed by many, is that
<br>
transhumanism, i.e. the idea that human beings should be able to improve
<br>
themselves radically through technology, does not have much intrinsic
<br>
political content. It is probably imcompatible with theocracy, although I
<br>
bet a theocracy could prove us wrong (maybe the Scientologists). And
<br>
racialism is bad science. But I don't think it makes sense to say that
<br>
simply because most transhumanists are anti-Nazi that transhumanists can't
<br>
be Nazis.
<br>
<p>Thanks again for your excellent comments.
<br>
<p>J. Hughes
