<p><p>Yes, some mineral forms of iron oxide are extremely tough and durable,
<br>
although the really indestructible forms contain quantities of non-oxidized
<br>
metal.  In fact, I have a minor anecdote about the toughness of certain
<br>
mineralized forms.
<br>
<p>My parents lived on an island in Alaska that was about 150 square miles of
<br>
caldera remnants.  However, on one lone peninsula off by itself, there was a
<br>
little yellow hill maybe 500 feet tall that was very different from the
<br>
surrounding geology.  The yellow color of the hill was actually a layer of
<br>
surface oxidation on the black rock underneath, the monolith itself being an
<br>
unusual form of very metal rich basalt.  One of the things that makes that
<br>
monolith special is that unlike the island it is found on, it is over two
<br>
billion years old, making it one of the older formations found in the world.
<br>
<p>What was interesting about that rock hill was that it had rather extreme
<br>
mechanical properties and was nigh indestructible.  The surface oxidation
<br>
layer acted as a protectant for the rock, allowing it to exist undegraded
<br>
after hundreds of millions of years in a very wet environment.  Some
<br>
enterprising individuals tried to quarry the rock on a number of different
<br>
occasions for use as a building material with an extremely high compression
<br>
strength and fantastic wear and environmental resistance.  The problem was
<br>
that the rock itself was too tough to cut.  They could not find a cutting
<br>
edge that was both hard enough and tough enough to make quarrying the
<br>
monolith even vaguely economical.  You had to use diamond edged tools to cut
<br>
the rock (which apparently was famous for shattering pickaxes and other
<br>
implements made with hardened tool steel), but even then the tools didn't
<br>
last long because the substrate holding the diamonds had a high failure
<br>
rate.
<br>
<p>In any case, this rock was essentially a big chunk of iron rich basalt in an
<br>
unusual mineralized form, and it was apparently a substantially tougher
<br>
material than most of the things we think of as &quot;tough&quot;.  While it wasn't
<br>
quite as hard as Al2O3, it was almost certainly much tougher than Al2O3
<br>
(i.e. very resistant to shattering), which is arguably a fine trade-off as
<br>
it appears to be at least as hard as most metal carbides and nitrides.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
