</em><br>
<p>This is my view.  Your life, and body, and organs
<br>
BELONG to you, and you ought to be able to do with
<br>
them as you please.  The folks who disagree, however,
<br>
are the ones in control, with legal constructs to
<br>
codify and institutional mechanisms to enforce their
<br>
view.  Basically, it's just a carry-over of the
<br>
ancient habit of state ownership, belief in ownership,
<br>
and belief in the legitamacy of ownership of the
<br>
individual. The emperor, the czar, the sovereign vs
<br>
the slave, the serf, the subject.  Your ass is theirs.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>This view has by no means disappeared, but I think it
<br>
fair to say that it has eroded quite a bit, perhaps
<br>
even to some critical point.
<br>
<p>If everyone's organs were recognized as items of value
<br>
personally owned, then--in what I view as the least
<br>
ethically controversial situation of a range of
<br>
possible situations--the organs of a person who has
<br>
died innocently, would simply be an asset of their
<br>
estate. (There is of course a whole anthology of
<br>
goulish possibilities where people--prisoners,
<br>
children, clones, the poor, etc--are carved up for fun
<br>
or profit,...but for now I'd like to leave that to
<br>
some later discussion of scary campfire stories and
<br>
similar human narrative entertainment practices.)
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to effectively police the trade...
</em><br>
<p>I don't know that I agree.  This feels to me like a
<br>
widely held fear that has risen to the level of a
<br>
widely held presumption.  Medicine is so very highly
<br>
regulated that it might be vastly more difficult and
<br>
way less profitable to pursue outside of regulatory
<br>
oversight.  I would ask if the problem, insofar as we
<br>
have seen the first small examples of it, stems from
<br>
the current black and grey market status of organ
<br>
commercialization.  If it were widely accepted, with
<br>
standardized practices, might the abuse practices
<br>
wither and disappear?  
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
