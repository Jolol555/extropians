From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=RE:%20Scientific%20method%20=%20device%20for%20accurately%20identifying%20incorre%20ct%20thinking?">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Scientific method = device for accurately identifying incorrect
</em><br>
thinking.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is another thread, but I would like to point out that 1) whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is universally accurate is strongly debated
</em><br>
<p>I'd say &quot;weakly&quot; debated rather than &quot;strongly&quot; -- and add that the debate
<br>
hasn't produced anything nearly as useful as what science has produced. When
<br>
a
<br>
device for accurately identifying incorrect thinking surpasses the ability
<br>
of
<br>
the scientific method to do so, we can measure the extent of its success by
<br>
using the scientific method.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------
<br>
<p>Id have to agree, and possibley add *very* weakly, and then only by
<br>
_philosophers_ of science most practicing scientists do not think to highly
<br>
of 'philosophy of science' To emphasize this point, let me reference
<br>
'Paradigms Lost' by John L. Casti starting on page 47... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In 1979 the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton held a celebration
<br>
to honor the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Einstein, the institute first and most celebrated resident genius. To plan
<br>
for this celebration, a committee was formed at the institute to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arrange a program and invite scholars from around the world to
<br>
participate. Just as Caesar divided all Gual into three parts, the IAS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;committee decided to organize the Einstein centennial similarly, focusing
<br>
on Einstein's science, the historical genesis of his ideas, and,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, the philosophical impact of his work. As Freeman Dyson tells it,
<br>
the committee solicited the names and put together lists of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scholars who could be invited in each of three areas. The committee was
<br>
personally acquainted with almost everyone on the lists of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scientists. As to the historians, the committee didn't know them
<br>
personally but at least had heard of most of the them and knew of their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;work. But when it came to the philosophers of science, Dyson remarks that
<br>
the committee was not only unfamiliar with them personally,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but had never even heard the names of most of them! More than any abstract
<br>
argument could ever hope to show, this little episode
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conveys the level of contact between the activities of the working
<br>
scientists and the arguments of the philosopher: It is exactly zero! In
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyson's words, &quot;There's a whole culture of philosophy out there somewhere
<br>
with which we have no contacts at all... there's really little
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contact between what we call science and what these philosophers of
<br>
science are doing- whatever that is.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyson's observation serves to unravel the contradiction noted a moment ago
<br>
between the beliefs of scientists and those of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophers. As far as most practicing scientists are concerned, there's
<br>
nothing more dangerous than a philosopher in the grip of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theory. In fact, there appears to be something of an unrequited love
<br>
affair between the scientists and the philosophers, in which the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scientists by and large spend their days ignoring the attempts by the
<br>
philosophers to press their attentions upon them. As an indicator
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the state of affairs, the physicists Murray Gell-Mann at all times
<br>
carries with him a doctors prescription forbidding him to argue with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophers on the grounds that it could be dangerous to his health! 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So we come to the perhaps not so surprising conclusion that if you want to
<br>
know about how scientists really think and work, you'll get
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;no help from a philosopher of science. However, if you concerns go beyond
<br>
what scientists do and encompass the broader issues of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significance of what they do and its relations ships to other
<br>
knowledge-generating mechanisms, then, as noted before, a consideration
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of matters of philosophical is unavoidable.&quot;
