<p>
The morals encoded in our genes pale by comparison to the genetically
<br>
encoded adaptations for reasoning and arguing about morality.  The latter
<br>
is also important in a hunter-gatherer society, after all.  Don't look at
<br>
the starter-set of adaptations, look at the adaptations for choosing
<br>
between moralities.  Don't look at the system, look at the dynamic for how
<br>
the system changes.
<br>
<p>One way to answer the question &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; is to
<br>
understand fully what it is that impels humans to ask this question,
<br>
phrased in this way.  Trying to explain that life &quot;really&quot; has no meaning
<br>
doesn't explain how it is that evolution accidentally constructed
<br>
organisms who think it does.  We may be very certain that evolution had no
<br>
&quot;deeper intentions&quot; in doing so.  Evolution simply doesn't work that way. 
<br>
But if you really want to answer this question, you have to understand how
<br>
evolution managed to accidentally construct organisms who, as an emergent
<br>
outcome of their set of locally adaptive rules for moral reasoning, look
<br>
for a &quot;meaning of life&quot; instead of being content with their inbuilt
<br>
goals.  Without this knowledge you can't answer the question &quot;What is the
<br>
meaning of life?&quot;  You can't even say for sure that it has no real
<br>
answer.  Until you understand where the question comes from, you don't
<br>
understand the question.
<br>
<p>Sigh... I really have to update the &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; FAQ.
