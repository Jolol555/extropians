Subject: Re: government contracting system known as &quot;cost plus&quot;
<br>
<p>Thanks James, you provided a good wealth of information on the subject.  It
<br>
seems though, from your description, that the only place it would be usefull
<br>
is when the project is open ended.  Otherwise it seems to have the incentive
<br>
to make projects take longer, cost more, and be more innefecient.  The
<br>
author, Robert Zubrin, for those not familiar with him, is the founder of
<br>
the Mars Society and the inventor (I think) of the solar magnetic sail.
<br>
This chapter was mainly relaying some of the reasons why we are using 30
<br>
year old rocket engines and why access to space remains so expensive.  There
<br>
may be other applications where a &quot;cost plus&quot; system is better, but that
<br>
doesnt seem to be the case in the instance of expendable launch systems or
<br>
re-usable launch systems, for that matter.  What do you think?  It seems to
<br>
me that the Titan and Atlas launch systems have been the same for the past
<br>
30 years, if that is the case, a 'how much can you make the Titan for' may
<br>
be a good typical competition based contract.  If the government expended
<br>
resources on making sure the vehicles are built to Spec and persue legal
<br>
actions if it isnt, it seems they would save more money in the long run, and
<br>
we would all have cheaper access to space.

<em>&gt; &quot;Beyond These considerations stands the government contracting system,
</em><br>
known
<br>
<em>&gt; as &quot;cost plus,&quot; which has been in place for some time now in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States. According to the people who invented the system, it is essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that corporations be prevented from earning excessive profits on
</em><br>
government
<br>
<em>&gt; contracts. Therefore, rather than negotiate a fixed price for a piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware and allow the company to make a large profit or loss on the job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on what its internal costs might be, regulators have demanded
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; the company document its internal costs in detail and then be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge a small fixed percentage fee (genarlly in the 10 percent range)
</em><br>
above
<br>
<em>&gt; those costs as profit. This system has served to multiple the costs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government contracting tremendously, so much so that it has produced
</em><br>
public
<br>
<em>&gt; scandals when news leaks out thabout the military paying $700 for a hammer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a toilet seat cover.
</em><br>
<p><p>There are a number of different contract structures used by the government,
<br>
and Lockheed uses all of them.  There is cost plus incentive fee (a hybrid
<br>
between cost plus fixed price and cost plus percentage profit), cost plus
<br>
fixed price (where the profit is negotiated independent of cost), cost plus
<br>
percentage profit, and firm fixed price being among the most common.  At
<br>
Lockheed, most of the military contracts where either cost plus fixed price
<br>
or cost plus percentage profit (which was usually around 7-8%, not 10%).
<br>
For science contracts, it was frequently firm fixed price contracts.
<br>
Government regulation controls a lot of the details of what is used where
<br>
and for how much money.
<br>
<p>The value of the &quot;percentage profit&quot; model is that it can be used for
<br>
somewhat open-ended projects e.g. projects where substantial engineering
<br>
research may need to be done before a solution will be found.  For bleeding
<br>
edge military development projects, this is almost always used as the total
<br>
cost of the project is not reasonably estimable many times, particularly
<br>
when the project requires the development of technologies that effectively
<br>
don't exist yet.
<br>
<p>As for the amount of personnel overhead, anyone that has done business with
<br>
the government knows that government contracts require ridiculous amounts of
<br>
personnel overhead to administer.  The regulatory requirements for doing
<br>
business with the government and filing paperwork far exceed anything that
<br>
is practiced in the private sector.  For large projects, you effectively
<br>
need hundreds of additional people for government contracts that you
<br>
wouldn't need for private contracts.  Which just reinforces the beliefs of
<br>
many on this list regarding the efficiency of government.
