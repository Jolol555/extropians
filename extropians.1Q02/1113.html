</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how do you differentiate between creativity and sentience?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ability to create, or the action of creating (creativity) is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from the capability to sense, or the action of sensing and directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing (sentience). Consequently, the algorithms and principles involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in acts of creation do not require creative agents to be sentient. 
</em><br>
<p>Please define &quot;creativity&quot; in a non-circular fashion, if possible.
<br>
Otherwise, it seems that you define creativity merely as the ability
<br>
to create (as the dictionary does), in which case:  are bacteria
<br>
&quot;creative&quot;?  Is reproduction (sexual or asexual) considered a
<br>
&quot;creative&quot; ability?  Would you consider offspring the product of
<br>
it's parent (or parents) creativity?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can be creative without being sentient, and conversely one can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentient without being creative.
</em><br>
<p>Can one have sight without being sentient?  Does having senses
<br>
imply being sentient, or asked differently, do machines that
<br>
purport to have senses (vision, smell, hearing, etc.) that
<br>
are clearly not &quot;senient&quot; by common agreement, truly not have
<br>
the senses that they claim to have?
<br>
<p>Isn't sensory perception composed of two things: sensory datum
<br>
placed in a frame of reference of one's self-awareness and awareness
<br>
of one's surrounding environment?  Sensory data without the ability
<br>
to contemplate (at least at a sub-conscious level) what the data
<br>
implies is simply data.  An algorithm which influences a machine's
<br>
behavior based on it's sensory data would appear to give the machine
<br>
some kind of awareness of the physical world in which it's
<br>
interacting -- isn't this a form of low-level sentience?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Superlative sentience (total awareness) reveals that the highest use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thought is to allow us to stop thinking (while being wide awake),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that we can appreciate the epiphenomenon of self-awareness.
</em><br>
<p>Don't all machines currently enjoy superlative intelligence, then?
<br>
Just because they don't express their appreciation for self-awareness
<br>
doesn't mean they aren't appreciating it.  The problem is that we
<br>
try to anthropomorphise machines and try to insist that because
<br>
the sentience they enjoy isn't the same as the sentience we enjoy,
<br>
therefore it's not sentience.  Just as for a long time, we couldn't
<br>
accept that animals could be just as sentient as humans are,
<br>
probably for the same reason (as well as the fact that they lacked
<br>
the proper language to convey their sentience to us humans).
