<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Not to mention Hal's claim is false. Just heard on the radio today of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; British study of the impact of wealth on health and happiness, which
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; mental health and happiness/self esteem.
</em><br>
<p>I remember a sociology class in college where my professor delighted in sharing with us the various advantages the financially well-off can give their children(as if it were almost evil to do so).  I think this man was a closet marxist! lol 
<br>
<p>I can clearly understand how increased wealth allows for better physical and mental health.  Enough money can definitely move you toward your life goals!!  I do think that a person can attain a certain level of wealth where they reach a place of diminishing returns.  Does it matter to these factors whether you earn ten grand or fifty grand a year?  You better believe it!  But does it matter whether you make a half million or a half billion a year??    
<br>
<p>I think when a person reaches a certain very high level of financial power, that the increased wealth is not all that important unless they are a driven empire builder and/or a very generous philanthropist.  
<br>
<p>And will even they be all that happier than the content upper middle-class person?  I admit they will be far more able to turn grand goals into concrete reality.  Doing that must be quite a rush!
<br>
<p>I like the old saying, &quot;money doesn't matter much unless you're poor!&quot;  Another one I get a kick out of is, &quot;money may not make you happy, but at least you can be miserable in comfort.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I loved it when Max More admitted on the list he wanted to be rich one day.  Hey, he does hang with the right sort of people for it!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
