<em>&gt;From: Neil Blanch &lt;<a href="mailto:neilb@nswcc.org.au?Subject=Re:%20Aid%20For%20Afghanistan">neilb@nswcc.org.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I am suggesting is that the US has a chance to offer real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leadership in key areas, a chance to lead by example rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ride roughshod over the rest of the world. I suggest that a policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that would promote friendship with the US rather than hatred is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your own best interests.
</em><br>
<p>It seems half the time the world is complaining that we're not
<br>
doing something and the other half that we are doing something.
<br>
<p>Make up your minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Nonsense. The Taliban did not even exist when we funded rebel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;groups in Afghanistan to oppose the Soviet invasion.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe ample evidence of US involvement in this issue was given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;earlier in v6#363-4 including the direct funding of Bin Laaden by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US government.
</em><br>
<p>Bin Laden yes when he was fighting the Soviets, never the Taliban
<br>
and never BinLaden since he became a terrorist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ME: &quot;There are people in this world who hate America &amp; America
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; has given them plenty of good reasons to have that hate.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;YOU &quot;A matter of opinion, an opinion we don't share.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Been to Bhopal? Seen what the US government has done in South
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America? Remember Vietnam? Laos? Cambodia? Indonesia? The Balkans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Shit - remember the nuclear tests in Utah on your own citizens?
</em><br>
<p>Bhopal was caused by a local screwing things up at a privately
<br>
operated plant, nothing to do with the U.S.
<br>
<p>What about South America, be specific.
<br>
<p>Vietnam? yes we opposed the Soviets and communism there, how many
<br>
countries have cone communist since?
<br>
<p>Laos? Cambodia? Countries that became involved in the war since the
<br>
NVA and Viet-cong used them for bases.
<br>
<p>Indonesia? you'll have to explain this one.
<br>
<p>The Balkans? Yeah, we prevented attempted genocide.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;YOU: &quot;You're claiming the Soviets were the legitimately elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government of Afghanistan?&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Absolutely not! I do think it is irresponsible to just abandon a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country like Afghanistan once your immediate objectives have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obtained. Leaving behind a power vacuum in Afghanistan has lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of war, opportunism by fundamentalist elements from other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nations (eg Pakistan) and all the misery &amp; suffering has surprise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surprise turned around &amp; bitten you on the arse. 
</em><br>
<p>Our objective was to help the Afghan people oppose the Soviet
<br>
Invasion.
<br>
<p>This is a typical case where if we had done anything else the world
<br>
would be bitching at us for meddling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;YOU: &quot;America is the freeist and most just country on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;planet.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Which is why you have such a large prison population and why your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justice system (the envy of lawyers everywhere! ka-ching!) largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to depend on what legal counsel you can afford or who you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are connected with (remember OJ, Iran/Contra?) - and yes, I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that it is only slightly better here in Oz. 
</em><br>
<p>We still have a problem with letting people be responsible for
<br>
their own behavior, and we have a problem with a paternalistic
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>Still the best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Oh &amp; the side bets seem like a good investment to me, given &quot;fuck
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you buddy&quot; attitudes like yours &amp; the ease with which terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;operations can be carried out by folks with a high school level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge of chemistry &amp; a mobile phone. 
</em><br>
<p>Straw man argument, ad hominem.
<br>
<p>And yes we suffered for being an open society, but watch what
<br>
happens to our enemies.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This all getting a little silly. Much as I enjoy the cut &amp; thrust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a good argument (and I admit have been given much to think on),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I doubt that many of us are here for sessions of moral finger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointing. Perhaps it would be best for the list itself to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these issues lie &amp; return to debates that are a bit more on-topic.
</em><br>
<p>Since this concerns the future of the human race it is most
<br>
certainly on target.
