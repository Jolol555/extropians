<em>&gt;Hmm Like I wrote of in my previous post regarding this, your abyss must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;located in a better neighborhood, then my abyss. My abyss intones, whenb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're dead you're dead; and when you are it'lll feel like eternal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffocation.
</em><br>
<p>Oh no, yours sounds perfectly normal.
<br>
<p>The deep abyss is never nice when one first meets it. It's
<br>
terrifying. Most people's biggest fear when they encounter the abyss
<br>
is that they will fall forever in that place. Writers talk about it.
<br>
It's in every religion. This void is a terrifying place because it's
<br>
a complete blank. A nothingness. The only thing in there is you. Can
<br>
you live with that? What is 'you' ?
<br>
<p>Imagine the fear one has when bungie jumping. Now remove the cord
<br>
and remove the Earth below, so you're in an eternal freefall. No
<br>
possiblity of a foot-hold or a person to 'fix' it. That's
<br>
bungie-jumping-fear multiplied a million times. Or, imagine being
<br>
somewhere where you don't have your culture, your language, your
<br>
family, your friends. Again, you are faced with a  complete
<br>
nothingness and then 'you'. Terrifying.
<br>
<p>Most people, when  they face a terror this large, go distract
<br>
themselves (running away from themselves) or find support, i.e. turn
<br>
on the television, play with the dog or the kid, call up one's
<br>
parents, play on the internet, pray, etc. They don't usually stay in
<br>
the abyss, because it's too frightening. This void is the loss of
<br>
all of your suppports, visible and invisible. So what do you do?
<br>
<p>Well one can choose consciously to depend on one's visible and
<br>
invisible supports and distractions, (although more people respond
<br>
unconsciously to have that dependence). Or one can choose to deal
<br>
with it, which means discovering what 'you' are. But in order to
<br>
first discover the 'essence' (for lack of a better word) of who one
<br>
is, one must first decide to live, that is, take responsibility for
<br>
one's life. From that point on, then you're building something. Your
<br>
awareness brings particular items into your world, you choose to
<br>
keep it or discard it, and, along the way, you discover 'you'.
<br>
<p>Given the topics that are discussed on this list, I don't see how a
<br>
person can shape the universe, including their own external physical
<br>
selves, unless they grasp their internal world: that is they know
<br>
'who' they are, without all of those supports and distractions. Can
<br>
you imagine being a 'brain in a vat' and not having a sense of who
<br>
you are? What is the driving force (without the supports and/or
<br>
distractions) that makes you jump out of bed every morning ? That's
<br>
what facing the abyss is about.
