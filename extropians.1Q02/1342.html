From: &quot;Dickey, Michael F&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=Re:%20Skeptics%20and%20extropians">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; seems to imply that contact with ETI would refute the very laws of physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which I asked Which laws of physics explicitly forbid that.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the clarification, Michael. I think what you mean is, How would
<br>
contact with ETI refute the laws of physics? That would make sense, since I
<br>
didn't say that any laws of physics explicitly &quot;forbid&quot; contact with ETI. To
<br>
qualify as laws, the predictions of theories must agree with observational
<br>
tests. &quot;Contact&quot; with ETI means physical connection. Since no laws of physics
<br>
predict physical contact with ETIs, and since no observational tests indicate
<br>
the presence of ETI, the laws of physics remain intact.
<br>
The ETI that I've heard about, the ones reportedly abducting Earthlings and
<br>
making &quot;crop circles&quot; and so on, contradict the laws of physics in that they
<br>
remain totally out of reach of our ability to confirm their existence via
<br>
physical/empirical tests, while they supposedly behave in rude and childish
<br>
ways (ie, making crop circles and abducting people). In principle, of course
<br>
it seems probable that ETI exist, because intelligent creatures have evolved
<br>
on Earth, obviously, so they could have evolved elsewhere in the universe.
<br>
Having developed high-tech that allows them to visit Earth (thus conquering
<br>
inter-stellar/inter-galactic space), they'd also experience an accelerated
<br>
rate of development which would in turn enable them to become
<br>
super-intelligent beings with no interest in visiting Earth. So, the laws of
<br>
physics that a visit by ETI would refute, are the laws of physics which make
<br>
accelerating technology possible. The so-called &quot;Fermi's paradox&quot; is answered
<br>
by noting that if they're smart enough to travel between galaxies (or even
<br>
stars), then ETIs are smart enough to find better things to do, which explains
<br>
why we don't see them. The laws of physics are based on reason which agrees
<br>
with observational/empirical tests, and physical connection with ETI opposes
<br>
reason because there's no reason for ETI to establish contact with Earthlings.
<br>
<p>Contact with ETI would refute the very laws of physics because it would oppose
<br>
the reason that the laws of physics are based upon. Those fabulous little
<br>
green men would have to be stupid to visit humans, and being stupid precludes
<br>
developing the required technology.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as the scientific method
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking.
