<p><p><em>&gt; Mr. Bishop quoted:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;What collectivists refuse to recognize is that it is in the self-interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of every businessman to have a reputation for honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealings and a quality product. Since the market value of a going business is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured by its money-making potential, reputation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;good will&quot; is as much an asset as its physical plant and equipment....&quot; [pp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 118] &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What came immediately to mind is the love-affair of the German businessman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the 3rd reich with business practices that that were both collectivist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and based on reputation. This may have nothing to do with todays business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentality, or it may be a warning that human behavior is not so maleable.
</em><br>
<p>One can discover the face of the Virgin Mary in the topography of *any* blueberry muffin- a general result from information theory,
<br>
afaik.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer. It does not build quality into goods, or accuracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into information. Its sole [&quot;contribution&quot;] is to substitute force and fear for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive as the &quot;protector&quot; of the consumer. The euphemisms of government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; press releases to the contrary not withstanding, the basis of regulation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armed force. At the bottom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun...&quot;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. Perhaps a substitute is the (collectivist?) mobilization of the consumer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the production of inferior goods and services. This would require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people purchasing such en mass, as to damage a corporation sufficiently to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either destroy the corporation or to force change. Color me dubious, on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular proposal.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't able to parse the meaning of the above. A boycott may produce the desired result. If it is grounded in reality, as they are
<br>
occasionally, the result is a net positive benefit for all but the producers of the &quot;bads&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Other methods may be brought to bear, as in a barroom brawl.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, treating others with the modicum of respect that characterizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization is more than simply a homily to good manners.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Glorp! I disagree. The [reason] is (even though I am unqualified to be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economist or a financial analyst) I distrust the inherent wisdom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;others&quot; referred above to are individual human beings. Corporations, which are legal fictions without any physical
<br>
manifestation, do not have inherent wisdom- individual humans (and animals) do. No financial analysis required to see this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the recent downturn began, the corpration managers seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have dusted off their olf business plans, on what to do for a recession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 1970s and 80's answer: layoffs! Unfortunately while Motorola and Cisco
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for example) were covering their asses, in this manner, they merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deepended the downturn into a recession. Collectively, these companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully disemployed so many people, that less have discretionary income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to purchase goods and services.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorola, Cisco, IBM, Lucent, JDS Uniphase, ATT, Noika, Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, Arthur Anderson, Texas Instruments, Hyundai,
<br>
Bethleham Steel, Enron, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Compaq, Cineplex Odeon et al, Ericson, Freightliner, Paccar, and so forth were each,
<br>
in their own ways, producing more of a product than the market could bear. In many cases, part of the product mix included
<br>
irrational accounting, market manipulations in concert with statist central planners, and poor econometric modeling, exacerbating
<br>
the collapses. In all cases, concentration of credit in the hands of the statists has resulted in the largest combined speculative
<br>
mania (bubble) in history by every measure, and a misallocation of scarce resources (malinvestment). Enron is simply one tiny
<br>
illustration.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The layoffs of people hired to produce unwanted goods (or &quot;bads&quot;) is an entirely expected, natural consequence of capital
<br>
liquidation. To keep them on would put what's left of the firm at risk of bankruptcy and dissolution, eliminating the jobs of
<br>
everyone. The alternative, which is far preferable, is to allow wages and salaries to *fall* to their market-clearing prices. Then
<br>
there would not be unemployment- yet another exhibit in the horror chambers of collectivist Statism.
