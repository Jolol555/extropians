I disagree with what the stated premise is. I believe we have been 
<br>
preoccupied with not preventing new powers from emerging, but the stand 
<br>
against communism and pro-Soviet regimes, for good and bad. 
<br>
<p>If we had wanted to stand against emerging powers, we would have squashed 
<br>
post WW2 Japan, and its economic burst on the scene (to our national 
<br>
disadvantage). Furthermore,  Nixon and subsequent Presidents would Never have 
<br>
gone to China or pushed for Most Favored Nations status. Also, you would 
<br>
Never have seen a peace dividend in the 1990's because we would have built 
<br>
the Pacific fleet to stand against China. We would have also squashed the 
<br>
EU/EEC by withdrawing from NATO, the second the Soviets collapsed, thus 
<br>
re-energizing nationalistic hostilities via Germany, France and the UK. 
<br>
<p>So what choo talkin; about Williis?
<br>
<p>-Moreover the policymakers named in the article were such putzes that its 
<br>
apparent to most current policy makers what failures these strategies were. 
<br>
C'mon, Brezinski, and Jame A. Baker the 3rd? What sterling foreign policies 
<br>
they had! Guffaw!
<br>
<p>I suspect that the authors could have re-titled their article 
<br>
&quot;NeoIsolationism is Never Having to Say You're Sorry.&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A New Grand Strategy&quot;
<br>
By Benjamin Schwarz and Christopher Layne
<br>
The Atlantic Monthly, January 2002
<br>
<p>For more than fifty years American foreign policy has sought to prevent
<br>
the emergence of other great powers - a strategy that has proved
<br>
burdensome, futile, and increasingly risky. The United States will be
<br>
more secure, and the world more stable, if America now chooses to pass
<br>
the buck and allow other countries to take care of themselves.
