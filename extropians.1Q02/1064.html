From: Mike Lorrey 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Everysen a Chief, none Indians&quot;, as Damien says in &quot;The White Abacus&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The underclasses should all be mindless robots, not human beings or
<br>
sentient ai. The problem with popular acceptance of this vision is that
<br>
too many people can't envision themselves as ever being a member of the
<br>
upper class, so they automatically assume that the intent is that they
<br>
be enslaved.&lt;
<br>
<p>Well now, Mike.  I agree with you.  While we may have somewhat divergent views on politics, I think the hierarchy of upper class and lower class has widdled away over the decades, society still wants to believe in it, or their need for it as a co-dependent relationship.
<br>
<p>I am familiar with this because of living in the South during my teens and university years and co-existing in the Martin Luther King pre-post assination.  I watched the race underclass while I lived in the race upperclass.  I also know this as a woman who has been part of the gender lowerclass, while striving to be gender-upperclass.  Then, I watched those who realized themselves beyond these lines in admiration.  I wouldn't understand this psychology if I hadn't experienced it.
