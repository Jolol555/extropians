Is this phenomenon still observed in late(r) life? I seem to have developed a bit of nearsightedness in my one
<br>
LASIKed-to-better-than-20/20 eye, and have been wondering if some adaptation effect related to my uncorrected eye might
<br>
be &quot;pulling&quot; the other back into elongation. The new nearsightedness only became noticeable after the one year warranty
<br>
expired (*sigh*).

<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; In order for the eye to be able to focus an image on the retina,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the axial length of the eye needs to be just right. If the eye is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long (or too short), then the image is perpetually focused in front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the retina (or behind it). The result is nearsightedness (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farsightedness). It turns out that the retina of the eye plays a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; role in making sure that the axial length of the eye is just right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How? Well, the retina has the ability to determine whether an image
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;in focus&quot; or &quot;out of focus.&quot; If an image is &quot;out of focus&quot; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the retina emits chemical signals that control the growth of the eye,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it either longer or shorter, as needed, so that the image can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be focused properly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there's a big unanswered question: How does the retina determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether an image is &quot;in focus&quot; or not? The obvious answer is that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image that's &quot;in focus&quot; is clear and has sharp edges, while an &quot;out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of focus&quot; image is blurry. So one idea is that the retina can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish between &quot;fuzzy&quot; and &quot;not fuzzy.&quot; But the photoreceptor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells (the cells that directly absorb the photons) cannot do this by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves. Instead, a little bit of image processing is required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The photoreceptor cells synapse onto bipolar cells, and these synapse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onto retinal ganglion cells. A single ganglion cell receives input
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from multiple photoreceptor cells. One function of ganglion cells is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in &quot;edge detection.&quot; An edge is defined as a sharp boundary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between &quot;light on&quot; and &quot;light off.&quot; So if the ganglion cells detect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of sharp edges, then they might be able to conclude that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image is focused on the retina.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with the above hypothesis is that the ganglion cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear *not* to be involved with the ability of the retina to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine whether an image is in focus. That is, if you kill off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ganglion cells (while keeping the photoreceptor cells intact), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the retina is *still* able to guide the development of the eye in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a way as to maintain the proper axial length. The experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence is still a little bit sketchy, iiuc; but an argument can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made that the photoreceptor cells, all by themselves, can determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether an image is focused or not on the retina. And as far as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, there's no way to explain, in classical terms, how that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work. &gt;&gt;
