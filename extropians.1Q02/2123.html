<p>
&nbsp;Robert Shiller's book Irrational Exuberance is a well-researched effort
<br>
to put recent stock market fluctuations in the appropriate historical
<br>
perspective. The book contains many minor flaws, but most of his arguments
<br>
are robust enough to be little affected by his mistakes.
<br>
&nbsp;He provides strong arguments against the most popular versions of the
<br>
efficient market hypothesis, shows that the rationalizations that have
<br>
been given recently for buying stocks at high prices are quite similar
<br>
to those given in the 1920s, is moderately convincing in his forecast
<br>
of well below normal returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the next decade, and
<br>
does a fairly good job of explaining why bubbles happen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The rest of this review will focus on some of the book's flaws, but I
<br>
hope nobody takes these criticisms as excuses to buy the S&amp;P 500 and hold
<br>
it for a long time. Nor should my comments be taken as advice to sell all
<br>
stocks today. The unusually low real short-term interest rates that we
<br>
have today make the outlook for 2002 fairly good. Also, stocks that have
<br>
had very small market capitalizations haven't been affected much by the
<br>
bubble, and might be safe to buy and hold.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The book's first and most important graph is somewhat misleading because
<br>
Shiller uses a linear vertical axis to plot prices and earnings over time.
<br>
This makes recent price/earnings ratios look higher relative to older ratios
<br>
than is actually the case. For instance, p/e ratios of the 1960s look much
<br>
higher than the 1929 peak, when they are actually about the same. (The 2000
<br>
peak looks unusual enough either way that this has little effect on his
<br>
main point). He is aware of criticism that the linear axis is misleading,
<br>
but shows no sign of understanding the criticism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Shiller relies a bit too much on the assumption that what the average
<br>
person is saying reflects the reasons why stock prices are going up.
<br>
That assumption is often adequate, but sometimes produces confusing
<br>
results. For example, I don't recall hearing anyone question the widely
<br>
held myth that Amazon was losing money on each book but trying to make it
<br>
up on volume around the time that Amazon's stock was selling at internet
<br>
bubble levels.
<br>
&nbsp;Demonstrating that most investors are thinking like investors have in
<br>
past bubbles, and don't have strong arguments for higher stock p/e's,
<br>
does not prove the absence of a good reason for higher p/e's. I have
<br>
one such reason to propose that works even if nobody understands it.
<br>
In most previous bull markets, the dominant companies were very dependent
<br>
on investment in factories and equipment to enable them to handle increased
<br>
demand. In contrast, many of the companies that led the bull market of the
<br>
1990s depended much more on forms of capital such as reputation and human
<br>
minds, and can expand their capacity with with only small additional
<br>
purchases of factories and equipment.
<br>
&nbsp;Increased prices for human capital doesn't cause much overinvestment in
<br>
human capital (i.e. having more babies - no company owns that new capital).
<br>
The internet bubble caused some excessive spending on reputation capital
<br>
(as evidenced by the fluctuations in internet advertising payments), but
<br>
many large companies like Coca-Cola weren't influenced by the optimism
<br>
created by their high stock prices to invest in more reputation capital,
<br>
because the connection between their industry's sales and their need for
<br>
reputation is quite weak.
<br>
&nbsp;This implies less resistance to bubble-level stock prices from companies
<br>
selling stock to fund capital investments, but also a long-term slowdown
<br>
in the growth of demand for capital. This may well mean that capital is
<br>
becoming permanently more abundant relative to demand, implying that in
<br>
the long run price/earnings ratios will be higher, and returns will be
<br>
lower, than in the past. Unfortunately, this hypothesis does not provide
<br>
any easy way to predict how much higher p/e ratios will be in the future
<br>
than they have in the past, so it is nearly useless at determining whether
<br>
current p/e ratios are reasonable. It's main implication is that there is
<br>
much room for doubt.
<br>
&nbsp;Shiller points out that the similar (but temporary) effects of the baby
<br>
boom demographics on the supply of capital don't explain why efficient
<br>
markets would have reacted to the capital surplus with a more uniform
<br>
rise in prices of all investment vehicles (including real estate and bonds)
<br>
than we have actually seen, and that comment applies to my proposed cause
<br>
as well. I don't think the markets have been reacting in a very efficient
<br>
way to the capital surplus - they have been acting like people have very
<br>
imperfect guesses about why stocks have been rising.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The word irrational in the title suggests that he demonstrates that investors
<br>
are irrational during bubbles, but much of his explanations are at least as
<br>
consistent with the hypothesis that investors are pursuing multiple goals,
<br>
and that the other goals sometimes interfere with the goal of maximizing
<br>
the return from their investments. Fitting in with one's social group is
<br>
an important goal for many people, using the same investment strategy as
<br>
one's peers are using appears to be a means towards accomplishing that,
<br>
which implies that people who give up some financial returns in order to
<br>
be like others aren't being obviously foolish (although they usually have
<br>
to mislead themselves about what they are doing). Also, the degree to which
<br>
people overestimate their own competence is a persistent enough phenomenon
<br>
that it must have some advantages which offset the problems it creates (e.g.
<br>
being confident may make one more influential).
