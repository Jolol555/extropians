<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have been wondering why so many of the world's most powerful religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem to have been born around the same time. It seems to me that many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the big religions got much of their power from the birth of writing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't see that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We have a large body of written works from the ancient Greeks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From them, we learned our earliest ideas of free market, democracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology, free speech, individualism, just to name a few. Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other cultures at that time such as the Etruscans were also forming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those concepts,  but we don't have a written record of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;daily life to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The religion for those Greeks were Apollo, Delphi's Oracle, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a collection of gods and goddesses. Those didn't survive through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time as 'powerful' religions.
</em><br>
<p>:-)
<br>
I didn't say that every time people started to use writing they produced a 
<br>
powerful, long-lasting religion -- I was just wondering about those that did.
<br>
<p>If I suggest that the birds in my garden use feathers to help them fly, 
<br>
then pointing out that jet planes don't have feathers doesn't invalidate my 
<br>
musings on the birds in my garden. :-)
<br>
<p>I do wonder what might have been different about the Greek writings that 
<br>
didn't lead them to overstate the superstitious qualities of their books. 
<br>
Perhaps it is to do with diversity. (I am on shaky ground here as my 
<br>
knowledge of ancient history is pretty thin.) Maybe writing spread so 
<br>
quickly among the Greeks and they developed a sufficient level of popular 
<br>
literacy that books didn't get the same mystical treatment.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

To the optimist, the glass is half full.

To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
