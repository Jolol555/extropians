<em>&gt; I wonder where the sources of all these numbers are? They seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like other dramatic statistics (area of rainforest cleared every year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children killed by sanctions against Iraq, increases/decreases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminality) that are told and re-told again and again to bolster a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular position, but which nobody ever checks or can name their source.
</em><br>
<p>I'm suspicious of all such numbers.  I'm also suspicious of people 
<br>
extrapolating too far.  E.g., when people take a statistic out of context -- 
<br>
say like the growth rate of mildew in your bathroom -- and draw a wild 
<br>
conclusion from it -- that mildew will cover the planet knee deep in x 
<br>
years.  Usually the next step after that is advocating a new government 
<br>
program.  (Not necessarily here, but in most other venues.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, how could we measure actual progress? I have seen some numbers based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on number of scientific journals, papers or Ph.D. theses, but that only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works as long as the average knowledge in them remains constant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic or structural changes doesn't affect them. Amount of published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique text might be another scale (presumably the knowledge is equal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% of it, by Sturegon's law :-), although now the amount of web has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be taken into account. 
</em><br>
<p>There does need to be a way of separating true knowledge growth from 
<br>
apparent growth.  I'm not sure if Ph.D. theses would be a good measure.  
<br>
Even with a 90% culling, how many of them are actually expanding knowledge? 
<br>
<p>Also, what type of knowledge are we talking about here?  Like Hayek, I would 
<br>
distinguish between several knowledges -- putting theoretical knowledge 
<br>
(e.g., QED) in a different category from, say, &quot;temporary&quot; knowledge (e.g., 
<br>
the price of asparagus at my local grocer today).  There are probably other 
<br>
types too.  Which ones are growing and at what rate? 
<br>
<p>My two cents!
