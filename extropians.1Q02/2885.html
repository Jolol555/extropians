<p>
I think the real relevance of the drug addiction issue to Extropians
<br>
is how it prefigures the conflicts which will arrive when more powerful
<br>
brain alterations are possible.
<br>
<p>Drugs provide only crude tools for altering mental function.  In the
<br>
future we will probably have much more effective means.  However these
<br>
will not necessarily be any more socially acceptable.  Someone could still
<br>
change his mind into a vegetative euphoric state, or into a goal-driven
<br>
socially-oblivious obsession.  They might still abandon children, or not
<br>
pay creditors, or harm whatever other victims are offered up to justify
<br>
penalizing drug use.
<br>
<p>What should the Extropian attitude be towards brain alterations?
<br>
Does society have the right to require people to behave in certain
<br>
conventional ways?  Can they be allowed to seek their own path even if
<br>
it looks to outsiders like a mistake?
<br>
<p>And to the extent that we do want to enforce certain rules, like not
<br>
allowing violence to others, or requiring attention to children, should
<br>
we ban the technology, or just punish the behavior?  Should we say that
<br>
applying electronic currents to the brain is illegal, like we now say
<br>
that injecting heroin is illegal?  Should someone who abandons their
<br>
children be treated differently if they have also altered their brain?
<br>
<p>Given the complexity of biological alterations which will be possible,
<br>
I think the only sensible approach is to judge behavior and not the
<br>
means and motivation behind it.  Rather than saying that drug users
<br>
should be penalized because they sometimes abandon their children,
<br>
we should say that abandoning children is illegal and people who do
<br>
so should be punished, whether they are using drugs, or have altered
<br>
their brain in any other way, or were genetically altered at birth,
<br>
or are just plain normal human beings (if that means anything).
<br>
<p>Knowing what lies ahead, doesn't it make sense to adopt the same position
<br>
with regard to drug use today?  Surely Extropians don't need to be trapped
<br>
in the same back and forth, liberal vs conservative arguments we can find
<br>
on the editorial page of any newspaper.  We have a unique perspective on
<br>
the problem, and we should bring that to bear in analyzing these issues.
<br>
For most people, the prospect of brain alterations is nothing more than
<br>
science fiction, of no relevance to present day issues.  Extropians should
<br>
know better.
<br>
<p>Hal
