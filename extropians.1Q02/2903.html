I posted the web page that dealt with the 'meaning of life'
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html">http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/tmol-faq.html</a> &gt; with an extropian view point
<br>
on the Skeptic forum.  I received some posts discussing how to calculate the
<br>
computing power of the human brain, thought others may be interested in
<br>
contributing to the discussion, hopefully some will have more knowledge on
<br>
the subject than I.  The Thread is below.  You can get to the forum at
<br>
<a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/skepticsociety/">http://forums.delphiforums.com/skepticsociety/</a> its under the 'meaning of
<br>
life' thread.

<p>Michael
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;the raw power of a human brain - i.e., around a hundred million billion
<br>
(10^17) operations per second &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested to know how you got to that number. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; As of 2000, computing power has doubled every two years, like
<br>
clockwork, for the past fifty-five years. This is known as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Moore's Law&quot;. &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's Law suffers from what I call the &quot;extrapolation fallacy&quot;. It
<br>
consist in drawing curve through past data, and predict
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the future data will follow that curve, without any consideration
<br>
of cause-effect relationships. However, there are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examples that extrapolation not always work. For example, if you look at
<br>
bacteria multiplying in a culture vat, extrapolation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would lead you to predict that you will soon have an infinite number of
<br>
bacteria (a Singularity!). This is because bacteria
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiply exponentially (at first!) However, after a while the growth
<br>
curve breaks away from the exponential and goes into a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plateau. This happens because previously unseen cause-effect
<br>
relationships (depletion of nutrients, accumulation of toxins,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc) kick in. I think that we will soon see that growth in computer
<br>
technology starts to deviate from Moore's Law. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware of the &quot;extrapolation fallacy&quot;! We see more and more examples of
<br>
it - Bjorn Lomborg uses it a lot in his book. Any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prediction based in extrapolations instead of rigurous cause-effect
<br>
relationship is highly suspect!

<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;the raw power of a human brain - i.e., around a hundred million billion
<br>
(10^17) operations per second &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm interested to know how you got to that number. &quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I did not do the calculation myself, but if you check the source
<br>
page I am sure the author has a link to it. Actually, I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checked again, the author cites their sources right after each
<br>
statement. As far as the Brain calculation power goes, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Author says &quot;2: I use the generous estimate of a hundred billion
<br>
neurons, with around a thousand synapses apiece,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending around two hundred signals per second, plus a factor of five for
<br>
good luck. For a much more detailed (albeit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outdated) analysis, see &quot;When will computer hardware match the human
<br>
brain?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm</a>&gt;&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; As of 2000, computing power has doubled every two years, like
<br>
clockwork, for the past fifty-five years. This is known as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Moore's 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law&quot;. &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Moore's Law suffers from what I call the &quot;extrapolation fallacy&quot;. It
<br>
consist in drawing curve through past data, and predict
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future data will follow that curve, without any consideration of
<br>
cause-effect relationships.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true, and I agree. I thought it was an interesting site. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, there are different types of 'extrapolation fallacies',
<br>
like the Elhric 'hundreds of millions will starve to death in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 80's because food production can not keep up with demand' What
<br>
happened to these Wide spread famines? Elhric
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drew trends out of food production, food demand, and growth rates, he
<br>
did not take into account Advances in agricultural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technologies which increased food production (even though these had been
<br>
obvious from the historical record) This is a limit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;predicting extrapolation fallacy, and assumes a technological stasis. I
<br>
find these criticisms highly dubious and on par with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 'everything that can be invented has been' mentality. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, Moores law is not describing the limits of growth, is it
<br>
making a reasonable projection based on historical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trends. Ray Kurzweil (<a href="http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html">http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html</a>) makes a
<br>
good case in his book 'The Age Of Spiritual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machines' that computing technology has followed Moore's law since
<br>
Babbages mechanical computer. Critics of Moor's law
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often cite technological limits, things like the size of the wires,
<br>
quamtum mecahnical interference, or the like. But I catagorize
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these with the 'everything that can be invented has' mentality, and they
<br>
do not take into account technological innovations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurzweil tracks Moore's law from the mechanical computer, to the
<br>
mechanical punch cards of the early part of this century,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the vacuum tube computers, to the transistor. Each time the practical
<br>
limit was reached of the previous technology, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successive one takes over. When the limits of the transistor is hit, any
<br>
one of numerous technologies is poised to take over,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optical computers, quantum computers, molecular computers, etc. etc. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You place a limit on moore's law due to some type of cause effect
<br>
relationship, yet its very obvious that one type of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computing technology, the organic brain, is still vastly superior to
<br>
conventional transistor based technologies. Here we have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tangible example of a far more sophistaced computing machine than we
<br>
can make, so it is reasonable that some trend will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue until *at least* a computer matches the power of the human
<br>
brain. To think otherwise would seem, at least to me,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be attributing some special supernatural quality to organic
<br>
computational systems that inorgantic or 'man made' ones will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never surpass. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems odd that you cite an 'extrapolation fallacy' when you are one
<br>
of the biggest arguers for global warming (which, it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems, is SOLELY based on extrapolitve predictions) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think that we will soon see that growth in computer technology starts
<br>
to deviate from Moore's Law. &quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we may see a limit at one time, but not (I think) at least until
<br>
a computer can match a human mind. But only time will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards, 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matus 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; the Author says &quot;2: I use the generous estimate of a hundred billion
<br>
neurons, with around a thousand synapses apiece,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sending around two hundred signals per second, plus a factor of five for
<br>
good luck. &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have (^ means exponent): 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^11 neurons x 10^3 synapses/neuron = 10^14 synapses in the human brain
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the standard estimate of synapses in the human brain, and I
<br>
agree with it. Let's look a the following step: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^14 synapses x 200 signals/synapse, sec x 5 (good luck) = 10^17
<br>
signals/sec 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 for &quot;good luck&quot; is just trash 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synapses don't process signals at 200 Hz (per sec). The typical synapse
<br>
signal is the EPSP or the IPSP, which has a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration of 5-20 millisec. So it's more like 100 Hz: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^14 synapses x 100 signals/ synapse, sec = 10^16 signals/sec, the
<br>
absolute maximum possible in the human brain 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if you want, NEURONS do send signals (action potentials) up to 500
<br>
Hz so 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^11 neurons x 500 signals/neuron = 5 x 10^13 signal/sec, a smaller
<br>
number 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realistically, taking into account that not all synapses work all the
<br>
time (that would be an epileptic seizure), that the brain is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not a perfect parallel computer, and that there is a lot of redundancy
<br>
in it, I would put that number at 10^13 Hz
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(signals/sec). And I think that even that is optimistic. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the human brain is not so far above computers when it comes to
<br>
process information. The PC I use to write this works at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^9 Hz, so my brain has the computing power of ten thousand PCs -
<br>
disapointing!. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think that you can invoke &quot;biological computer&quot; technology to
<br>
move forward Moore's Law. Brains are not a whole lot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better than computers, when put exclusively in terms of information
<br>
processing. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll answer the rest of your points later.
