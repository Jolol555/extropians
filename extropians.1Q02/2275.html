<em>&gt; Definitely.  Most security experts consider closed source software to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security threat.  It cannot be verified, contains more security flaws than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open source software, and requires giving the software vendor inside access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your computer without being sure what they are doing.  The higher levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of security control in most criteria systems actually require open source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and source code analysis.  Closed source software cannot be made as secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as open source software according to these security ratings.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with this.  I have worked for many years on a security
<br>
program, PGP, with published source.  In my experience the degree of
<br>
review provided by the open source community is haphazard, random and
<br>
spotty.  Just publishing software as open source is no guarantee that
<br>
anyone will review its security flaws closely.
<br>
<p>In my opinion and experience, a far more effective method is to pay
<br>
for an independent review by security experts.  I would rather trust a
<br>
closed source program which has been given a clean bill of health by a
<br>
review team I trust than one which has been published on sourceforge.net
<br>
for a couple of years with whatever degree of review and inspection the
<br>
public happened to give it.
<br>
<p>Furthermore there is the risk that publishing software source code will
<br>
give more information to the bad guys to allow them to design exploits.
<br>
Sadly, this is often a greater motivation for identifying security
<br>
holes than an altruistic desire to improve the quality of someone else's
<br>
software.
<br>
<p>The people for whom security is a life and death matter, like the military
<br>
and spy agencies, do not publish their internal software as open source.
<br>
I believe they share the belief that doing so is not the optimal way
<br>
to secure their software.  They rely on internal reviews, attack teams,
<br>
and closed source.
