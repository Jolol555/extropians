<p>
If, as I and many here think, the case for classical liberalism is
<br>
really strong, when not obvious, in many areas of society, one wonders
<br>
how come it is, especially in Europe, so marginally accepted.
<br>
<p>Much of it is really not very complex, and libertarian authors seem to
<br>
keep repeating the same truths almost unchanged books after books. You
<br>
read Adam Smith, then you read Friedrich Hayek, then you read Ayn
<br>
Rand, then you read David Friedmann, and of course they have
<br>
disagreement on SOME issues, but on MANY issues, on which they
<br>
disagree with MOST people, they are really saying the exact SAME
<br>
things. (In fact, I sometimes get a bit frustrated that they don't at
<br>
least try to generalize that stuff to principles, and prefer to retell
<br>
all the details in all the particular cases.)
<br>
<p>In France, you can now hear almost EVERY DAY of sallient problems
<br>
obviously caused by hazardous state intervention. On the ground that
<br>
it will make the situation more &quot;fair&quot;, the state makes all sorts of
<br>
funny decisions, that quickly results in all sorts of problems, and
<br>
overall dissatisfaction and damage, to which it replies by more funny
<br>
decisions. Anyway, you get the picture, and that's not my point.
<br>
<p>My point is, I am not happy repeating the same arguments over and over
<br>
to convince a few friends. I do repeat them, and I do convince them.
<br>
But I am not happy with it. And it seems that even writing a book
<br>
(something like the &quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot;, for example), and
<br>
having the good fortune of making a hit, doesn't result in very much.
<br>
Such books are published in continuation since the beginning of the
<br>
century. People may talk about them, but most people apparently still
<br>
fail to be convinced. One such book (&quot;Libéralisme&quot; by Pascal Salin)
<br>
was published in France by Odile Jacob in 2000, and hardly noticed.
<br>
<p>So, as obviously some of the political directions we will take may be
<br>
very significant to many of our extropian preoccupations, and as we
<br>
are still a democracy, I am wondering about better ways to convince.
<br>
<p>Two suggestions. First, insisting that freedom and responsability are
<br>
something nice to have on an individual basis strikes me as not the
<br>
right course (it may be the course taken by Ayn Rand's novels, but I
<br>
haven't read them so I don't know). It so happens that this only
<br>
appeals to very few people (the ones with high self-confidence), which
<br>
is probably the reason why libertarian ideas are still so marginally
<br>
accepted. But when people realize that personal freedom and
<br>
responsability must be protected for the society to flourish and solve
<br>
its problems, then, if the argument is convincing, it should appeal to
<br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>The other suggestion is that much of it should be modelable into a
<br>
computer simulation. Doing the modeling, then showing what happens
<br>
when you add a law, etc., should be enlightening. (One obvious
<br>
difficulty is that one of the main virtue of freedom is invention
<br>
brought by diversity, and invention doesn't seem very easy to model ;
<br>
but you could use genetical algorithms on a specific solution space for
<br>
that.)
<br>
<p>Imagine that you make a big hit with such a game. Suddenly most young
<br>
people are equipped with the right concepts, and the habit to think
<br>
dynamically about these things.
<br>
<p>Make it accessible on the Internet, as a Java application or as a
<br>
downloable software, so that anyone can play the legislator and have a
<br>
look at how things evolves. &quot;Make social justice if you can !&quot; Make it
<br>
fun.
<br>
<p>Better yet make it a multiplayer game, replacing much of the simulated
<br>
decisions by decisions actually made by the human players in the given
<br>
context, and making the experience much more convincing. Any other
<br>
suggestion ?
