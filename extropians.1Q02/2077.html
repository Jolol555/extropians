</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't _need_ a more modern calculator- if I have a complex calculation
<br>
to make, I do it in a spreadsheet so that I can reuse the code later. 
<br>
For things like converting a heat of combustion to a heat of formation,
<br>
doing it by hand with a calculator is just silly.  I mostly use the
<br>
calculator for doing quick checks of simple math functions, like
<br>
dividing one flowmeter count into another to get a mixture ratio.  I
<br>
have twenty years of reflexes tuned to this calculator keypad, a not
<br>
inconsiderable investment.
<br>
<p>As for advanced features, the HP-11C is a programmable calculator with
<br>
two shift keys to provide 110 key equivalents- it doesn't do graphing or
<br>
automatic equation solving, but I don't want to rely on a handheld tool
<br>
without an audit trail for that anyway.
<br>
<p>Like anything in life, one finds a working balance between useful tools
<br>
and innovation for innovation's sake. I'm currently working on three
<br>
projects which should lead to patents and new contributions in my field.
<br>
I don't need flashy toys to make me feel useful.
