<p>I have not read the novel yet, but the reviewer makes some good points
<br>
about the problem of writing sf that stretches between two extremely
<br>
different conceptual domains. In many ways Egan may be approaching a
<br>
kind of understanding horizon - some of his concepts simply can't be
<br>
parsed without a firm grounding in differential geometry or quantum
<br>
gravity, and any attempt to simplify them for the reader loses out the
<br>
essential properties.
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to see what happened if one wrote a sf story
<br>
whose intended audience were already totally familiar with the field.
<br>
Sf for mathematicians, with no pretenses of being understandable by
<br>
everyone (hmm, I have been thinking about the possibilities of exotic
<br>
differentiable structures in R^4 for some time...)
<br>
<p>Of course, to some extent this problem is true for most real sf (I here
<br>
disregard stories about WW II ace pilots, hardboiled detectives or
<br>
classical myths given a sf garnishing): they build on shared
<br>
assumptions and concepts that have to be learned by reading other sf
<br>
(and possibly some popular science): wormholes, hyperdrives, AI,
<br>
nanotechnology, psionics etc - they all have implicit connotations that
<br>
make them easy to re-use, suggest their role in the story and some
<br>
things they can and cannot do. A reader unfamiliar with these
<br>
connotations would find reading a sf novel hard or impossible. Which
<br>
may be one reason why sf is not as popular as fantasy, whose tropes and
<br>
assumptions are often built on more widespread stories. 
<br>
<p>In the long run it seems that sf may get into the same problem as much
<br>
of science: as long as it wants to write stories about *ideas*, it
<br>
needs to create macros, terminology and concepts that allow stories to
<br>
deal with more and more remote ideas, but to be able to understand the
<br>
stories the readers have to educate themselves further and further.
<br>
Eventually the gap becomes so large that the science or sf sub-genre
<br>
(like Egans posthuman theoretical physics stories) become isolated, a
<br>
realm that can be truly visited only by experts.
