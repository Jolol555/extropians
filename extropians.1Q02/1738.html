<em>&gt;In an odd sense, it's almost a pity that immortality WON'T be expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If people were afraid of being &quot;left behind&quot;, more of them might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inclined to take up the offer when it becomes available... people who'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turn down immortality if you offered it to them for free would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scream to the high heavens if only the wealthy could buy it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately I can't think of an ethical and practical way to make use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this kind of reverse psychology. Those who maunder on about the &quot;digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;divide&quot; may be doing the job for us, but they probably accomplish far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harm than good.

<p>Perhaps it should be insanely expensive at first, then pretty cheap after 
<br>
that.  Like mobile phones were initially.  In the early 90's, people 
<br>
despised the Yuppies for their extra appendage; they said it was vain, 
<br>
showing off their financial excess, too expensive to justify.  Within a 
<br>
decade the whole damn place has one, and everyone thinks their very handy 
<br>
and not a bit &quot;showy&quot; or vain.  People who would have been embarrassed with 
<br>
the very idea of answering such a phone in a crowded street now happily 
<br>
whip out and dial away.
<br>
<p>My guess is that people don't yet realize how &quot;handy&quot; indefinite lifespan 
<br>
will be.  But once the Youth Yuppies show it up, they'll get the message.
<br>
<p>I sometimes think that some of the people who speak so strongly against 
<br>
extended life are the people who are most afraid of the temptation to try 
<br>
it, because they know they won't be able to resist.
<br>
<p>My feeling is that it'll be the ladies who come to the rescue of indefinite 
<br>
life.  While most of them don't realise it yet, they are the most public 
<br>
group with the desire for &quot;eternal youth&quot;, and not just in terms of surface 
<br>
appearances.  Women's beauty products are being sold with &quot;anti-ageing&quot; 
<br>
compounds that &quot;delay the signs of ageing&quot;.  The beauty queen of the future 
<br>
may not be stick slim, but she'll be 50+ and looking like she's 21.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p><p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
