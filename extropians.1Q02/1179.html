Subject: Re: G. Coyne, priest (jesuit), astronomer
<br>
<p>&quot;Thanks for the links Amara. It does not surprise me that Jesuits are doing
<br>
work of this kind. From my own experience and what I read, SJs are very,
<br>
very smart people. Steve Davies&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, from what I have and heard about Jesuits and the little interactions
<br>
that I have had makes me agree.  Their arguments for the existence of god
<br>
are not usually cofined to silly things creationists and other lesser
<br>
learned people adhere to.  I was lucky enough to have a former professor who
<br>
was a jesuit preist.  He left the preisthood because he liked to drink to
<br>
much, or so he told them.  He was in it for a good 25 - 30 years, he
<br>
admitted to us that he left because he was too &quot;hornfull&quot;  He taught a
<br>
course on World Religions and another course on Ethics.  I remember a
<br>
lecture of his, explaining to the students that the differences between men
<br>
and women, as defined by society, are decreasing every generation.  A few
<br>
generations ago, he explained, you could tell with reasonable accuracy that
<br>
someone was a man or a women from a significant distance.  (e.g. It used to
<br>
be that only women had long hair and never wore suits) Every successive
<br>
generation requires one to be closer (on average) to the person they are
<br>
trying to determine the sex of.  (SNL's 'PAT' comes to mind) It was a good
<br>
discussion and a good way to introduce many of the students to the
<br>
arbitrariness of many social constructs.  He finished his lecture by
<br>
exclaiming that he is already turned on by half the population, and would
<br>
love it if he could walk into a room and be turned on by everyone!  He was
<br>
in mid 60's during this course, a very interesting and unique fella.  
<br>
<p>I aslo read a book, sometime back, called 'The Sparrow' about when Earth
<br>
first detects signals from an alien civilization through the SETI program.
<br>
It takes place in the near future, and the Jesuit Priesthood enacts a plan
<br>
to send a ship and a crew out there to greet them and learn about them.  The
<br>
Author, Maria Doria Russell, I believe has had significant contact in her
<br>
life with Jesuits, which is what inspired her to write the main charachter
<br>
as a Jesuit.
<br>
<p>Here is the book link for anyone interested.  It was an enjoyable read.
