<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, I get bitter and disgruntled sometimes.  I don't mean to counter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian Principle of Dynamic Optimism.  But I do think it is important
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; accurately see how bad things are so we can work more efficiently to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or solve problems.  I find a lot of discussions on this list simply naive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Happy talk or ignoring problems won't make things better.  Accurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceiving the world and then excelling anyway is an even better course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward success.  I think I am doing so well in my life because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly attacked these problems head-on and found a way to work around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  I am not sure I would be as intelligent, creative, or successful if
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; had previously moved from Florida to a more accepting environment.
</em><br>
<p>Given our more informal and enlightened society, attacking day-to-day
<br>
problems head-on is still rare, and I salute, you, Harvey!
<br>
<p>Something like 15 years ago I came upon a TV talk-show program (it may have
<br>
been Donahue) where one dignified, interesting looking gent figuratively
<br>
hovered above all the other people - even as some members in the TV audience
<br>
hurled insults at him.  He was just fantastic, and I was then-and-there
<br>
inspired to read the well-known book he had written, The Naked Civil
<br>
Servant.
<br>
<p>His name was Quentin Crisp, and as fate would have it about five years later
<br>
(1991) I was privileged to give a tea in his honor at my house (which many
<br>
people attended), and to correspond with him for a time before he died in
<br>
1999.  The thing that was so inspiring to me about Quentin is that he &quot;came
<br>
out&quot; as a self-described homosexual back in England ... back in the 1930's.
<br>
The physical abuses he suffered, the list of jobs he lost and the insults he
<br>
dealt with every day are beyond belief.
<br>
<p>There are few real heroes.  Throughout history actors, politicians, writers
<br>
(everyone, really, but I mention a few of these in-the-public-eye
<br>
professions here) - so many of people could have taken a stand, made a
<br>
statement, exposed some problem to the public, inspired others, made the
<br>
world a better place ... faster.  Certainly, there have been a few.  It seem
<br>
much more common, however, for people - when put in a position to do
<br>
something about a problem - not to do very much, or ignore the problem
<br>
altogether.
<br>
