Subject: Solving World Problems: Warlords
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The problem: almost nowhere in the world does the rule of law actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply fully.  Any major nation on Earth has those who would track its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faults (USA; the EU - or, if you prefer, each of its member nations;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia; Japan; Russia; China; et cetera), and most non-major nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barely have even a pretense of laws.  It is in the latter that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is most evident: a farmer's yearly harvest can be stolen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds by thugs with guns, under the guise of &quot;taxation&quot;, &quot;fees&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of a number of other official excuses.  The farmer, of course, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually left with enough for himself to survive...else, who would plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fields next year?  The burden of taxation is also not always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent; some years, taxes - or just bad luck in the form of drought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatnot - are heavy enough to force the farmer to find work in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Market reform and capitalism have also been proposed, on the theory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the naural laws of commerce will induce the oppressors to reform as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see that, for instance, businesses prefer to invest where there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable (and enforced) laws, since this greatly reduces their potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk (risk-averse, relatively-low-reward businesses seem to be dominant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though these all too often blind themselves to long-term risks in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to minimise short-term risks).  While this has been used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited success, for instance with China, it relies on there being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal economy and a large enough labor force that business contacts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must go through more than a few people: bribing a few people is easy;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bribing each of an army of bearaucrats is expensive.
</em><br>
&nbsp;I agree that this is not a panacea. The problem is the assumption that
<br>
warlords (local elites)  will make these reforms and adopt the rule of law
<br>
out of self interest since such reforms will make everyone better off
<br>
(including the elite). This is true but the process will also undermine the
<br>
elites' power and their ability to use it. There are also big advantages
<br>
from being a rich, powerful person in a poor country. So it's frequently not
<br>
in the warlords interest to reform seriously. China and Japan show one
<br>
factor which can push elites in the direction of meaningful reform,
<br>
competition with other states in the international system. This doesn't
<br>
apply however in places like Latin America or Africa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So...what other solutions are there to this problem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think there are a number of things we can try. Some kinds of technology do
<br>
help to undermine concentrated power so you should encourage their
<br>
spread/adoption. Simply encouraging trade is also very useful. In many cases
<br>
however I think you need to develop a power which can face down the
<br>
&quot;warlords&quot;. As you rightly say, traditional violent revolution is a classic
<br>
case of the cure being worse than the disease. The alternative is surely the
<br>
many forms of non-violent resistance, particularly developing a system of
<br>
parallel institutions. I'm not against the use of force defensively however,
<br>
as elites will often go to almost any length to protect their position.
