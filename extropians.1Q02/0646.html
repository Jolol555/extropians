Another Reason to move life off-planet, besides, the sun going nuts, global 
<br>
warming due to methane burps, volcanic calder'a's going poop, and your 
<br>
movie-grade meteor strike.

Ancient Supernova May Have Triggered Eco-Catastrophe 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;An exploding star may have destroyed part of Earth's protective ozone layer 
<br>
2 million years ago, devastating some forms of ancient marine life, according 
<br>
to a new theory presented at this week's meeting of the American Astronomical 
<br>
Society. The new theory brings together puzzling clues from several different 
<br>
fields of research, including paleontology, geology and astronomy. Narciso 
<br>
Benitez, an associate research scientist in astronomy in the Krieger School 
<br>
of Arts and Sciences at The Johns Hopkins University, says the &quot;missing 
<br>
smoking gun&quot; that brought the clues together was the revelation that a 
<br>
stellar cluster with many large, short-lived stars prone to producing 
<br>
supernovae had passed near Earth's solar system several million years ago. 
<br>
That discovery, made by co-author and Space Telescope Science Institute 
<br>
astronomer Jesus Maiz-Apellaniz, led Benitez to check the scientific record 
<br>
for potential effects of nearby supernovae on the Earth. &quot;Nobody had realized 
<br>
that this cluster of stars that Jesus had tracked, which is known as the 
<br>
Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, could have been so close to Earth during 
<br>
the past several million years,&quot; Benitez says. &quot;And when I did a search, one 
<br>
of the first things that popped out was a 1999 finding where a team of German 
<br>
astronomers led by Klaus Knie detected the presence of a highly unusual 
<br>
isotope of iron in samples of the Earth's crust drilled from the deep ocean 
<br>
bottom.&quot; &gt;&gt;
