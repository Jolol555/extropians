From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Jaron%20Lanier%20Got%20Up%20My%20Shnoz%20on%20AI">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; But it's a little tricky to go on a program of self improvement and evolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher capabilities if you're dead, I think it would cramp my style.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're not dead now... So, what's holding you back?
<br>
Why not be superlatively sentient right this instant?
<br>
(Buddha didn't need to get frozen to be hyper-cognitive.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; Artificial sentience has no monetary value for the same reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;that human  sentience has no monetary value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no way that could be true.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody is going to pay you for the sentience that you claim to have.
<br>
Furthermore, you can't even prove that you *are* sentient... and who cares
<br>
anyway.
<br>
The market pays for services rendered and/or products delivered, and it cares
<br>
nothing about the level of awareness of the entity that provides those goods
<br>
and services. A twenty dollar bill has the same value whether you get it from
<br>
an ATM or a human bank teller.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If sentience had no monetary value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution would not have invented it.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution has invented all kinds of things that have no monetary value. For
<br>
example, freckles, mosquitoes, and cat snot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sentient beings must behave in ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that non sentient beings do not, in this case in ways that enhance survival.
</em><br>
<p>If it enhances their survival, sentient beings can behave exactly like
<br>
non-sentient beings. For example, opposums pretend to be dead so that they can
<br>
survive predators' attacks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Behavior always has monetary value.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess some dope-smoking slackers would like to believe that, but the
<br>
real world doesn't pay for behavior that produces nothing of monetary value.
<br>
No one is going to pay you to sit and watch TV and drink beer, and no one is
<br>
going to pay anyone to sit in contemplation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;Furthermore, we can attain  superlative sentience, while our creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;ability may remain undeveloped.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't have superlative sentience without new superlative thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that's just another name for creativity.
</em><br>
<p>Superlative sentience is ended the moment the brain is disturbed by thought,
<br>
which contaminates the purity of awareness. Creativity is a general term which
<br>
includes any act of creation, including really ugly thoughts.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>As the scientific method accurately identifies incorrect thinking, inevitably
<br>
it displaces thought itself.
