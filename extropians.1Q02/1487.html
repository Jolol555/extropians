</em><br>
<p>Funny you should mention that....  I've been thinking about the &quot;long view&quot;
<br>
of my life.  It very well could happen that immortality never becomes
<br>
mainstream.  Even if it does, it could take a very long time.  Or even if it
<br>
comes quickly, we will be the founders or the originators with everyone else
<br>
being some sort of late-comers.  A small group of us will be all that
<br>
remains of the original transhuman generation.  We will be the only
<br>
survivors after an entire generation is wiped out or saved.  In any case, we
<br>
will be an odd minority with a different history and background than anyone
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>It is almost as if we are aliens here, just passing through.  Or we are
<br>
immortals for whom a brief flash of a single generation seems less
<br>
important.  While the rest of the generations come and go, we may be the
<br>
only long-term relationships we have in the future.  Or if a whole
<br>
generation becomes immortal, we will be the oldest or the first of that
<br>
generation.  We may be more advanced than the rest of the world, or left
<br>
behind as a future evolves off in an unexpected direction.
<br>
<p>In any case, I see this group of people as family.  We are all far-flung
<br>
cousins that cannot simply be ignored.  Even if we disagree on some points,
<br>
we will have to learn to get along.  It's a small universe and we're going
<br>
to keep running into each other.  It is almost as if we are stranded in a
<br>
small subculture that forever ties us together as different from anything
<br>
that preceded us or that might follow.  We will be a small band of travelers
<br>
into the future.  Even if the future is full of transhumans, our particular
<br>
group will be comparatively small.
<br>
<p>Any thoughts?  Or am I not getting enough caffeine again?
