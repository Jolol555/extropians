dedication, energy and so on.  I have met a few people in my

there are not essential differences in people in actuality

different outcomes in how much they acheive and how much they

needed).

been fortunate enough to meet a few people in my time that I

school  (I suspect many here were) to understand &quot;effortlessly&quot;

things that most  had to struggle mightily with.  I used to feel

guilty for getting the A while others worked many, many times

harder to eek out a C.  But does that mean the system was unjust

or simply that we are not all born or nurtured or somehow

[randomly] meta-programmed equally?

<br>
receive all or a lot of that difference is another question.  In 
<br>
point of fact, most of the major contributors are &quot;in the

<p><p>Well, I believe it is more complicated than that.  And whether

humans are that different from one another or not isn't even the 
<br>
crux of the question imo.  The question is one of relative 
<br>
influence, well-being, access to tools and power to acheive. 
<br>
Personally I think that maximizing the last three for all people 
<br>
should be near the top of extropian goals.  But we don't need to 
<br>
deny differences in people to do this.
