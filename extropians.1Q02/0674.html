<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;For Mike and his fellow conservative ideologues, consider an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then clearly the intelligence enhancement was a failure, give Greg

<em>&gt; &gt; Burch or one of his associates a call.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to mention Hal's claim is false. Just heard on the radio today of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British study of the impact of wealth on health and happiness, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that increased wealth correlated directly with an increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental health and happiness/self esteem. This obviously contradicts the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular socialist notion that wealth does not equal happiness, so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follows that those continuing to adhere to socialist mindsets are of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower intelligence, and are therefore those who need the upgrade.
</em><br>
<p>You can probably guess what Spock would say about that chain of
<br>
reasoning ;-)
<br>
<p>To my knowledge the studies that have been done have not shown any
<br>
correlation of happiness with wealth; it seems to vary a bit with which
<br>
society you are a part of, and direct poverty of course seriously
<br>
impacts happiness. Health has a measurable social factor, but apparently
<br>
not (unless we are talking about countries with very bad conditions) due
<br>
to marked differences in treatment but likely due to differences in
<br>
education, coping strategies and likely stress. It seems to correlate
<br>
more with power distances than actual wealth levels - poorer people are
<br>
healthier in low power distance countries than in high power distance
<br>
countries. 
<br>
<p>There was one study of gifted students showing that there were a fairly
<br>
good correlation between intelligence, health, success and happiness. Of
<br>
course, that is a biased sample of people who have been told that they
<br>
are special and will do great, but there does seem to be some links
<br>
here. 
<br>
<p>All in all, the evidence seems to suggest that 1) low power distances
<br>
are health promoting, 2) it is good to be smart and educated, or at
<br>
least think that you are smart and can be educated. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;It's not implausible: in fact in many of the most difficult and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;esoteric branches of science and mathematics, branches which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;require the highest levels of sheer abstract intelligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;thrive, Socialism and allied political philosophies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;widespread.  I remember reading an obituary in The Mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Intelligencer which went to some length to apologize for the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;that the deceased was not a Socialist.  He was still a decent guy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the obit hastened to explain, he just had this one little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;political blind spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd have to contest this. While the particular political agenda of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematical Intelligencer only indicates its own blind spots, in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience it is those scientists who practice in the real world: i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineers, who overwhelmingly are anti-socialist (and they generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a dim view of scientists who spend their lives in the Ivory tower.
</em><br>
<p>Broken record time again: see Hayek's _The Intellectuals and Socialism_. 
<br>
<p>My experience is that mathematicians are not particularly political,
<br>
while the social sciences broadly speaking have a noticeable left
<br>
leaning - partly likely due to the decline in social status of the
<br>
Swedish humanists, partly due to not biting the hand that funds, and
<br>
mainly because the discourse of the entire field has been steeped in
<br>
socialist ideas for a long time here.
