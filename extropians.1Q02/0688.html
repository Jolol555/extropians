<p>If we can restore brain plasticity, I think we should be able
<br>
to get effective cures for the long deaf.  Similarly if we
<br>
can produce individual specific proto-stem-cells I think
<br>
we can reverse even the extremely aged.  A really effective
<br>
age reveral program is going to require the immune system
<br>
detecting and removing aged cells while the stem cells provide
<br>
new replacements.
<br>
<p>The last deaf and last aged need not be lonely if they know
<br>
they freely chose that path and their wishes were respected
<br>
by others.
<br>
<p>The really sticky issue now is the problem that the recently
<br>
posted Dawkins article pointed out -- Just like parents behave
<br>
so as to create a child that &quot;is Catholic&quot; or &quot;is Protestant&quot;,
<br>
deaf parents have to make choices for their children (due to
<br>
the current lack of ability to restore brain plasticity)
<br>
to make their child &quot;one of the deaf&quot; or &quot;one of the hearing&quot;.
<br>
Currently they can't wait and let the child choose without
<br>
effectively handicapping the child.  I can't definitively
<br>
say that being &quot;one of the hearing&quot; is better than being
<br>
&quot;one of the deaf&quot;, but I can say that having an extra sense
<br>
probably does reduce your hazard function.  So parents
<br>
choosing to keep their children deaf may be placing them
<br>
at a higher risk for accidents.
