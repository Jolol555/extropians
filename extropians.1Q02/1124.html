Subject: Re: Jaron Lanier Got Up My Shnoz on AI
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Parallel and serial processing are algorithmically equivalent, with
</em><br>
parallel
<br>
<em>&gt;processing being the more restricted of the two.  The only qualitative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference is that massively parallel processing has transaction theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues that make it less capable than serial processing for some types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work.  In the best case scenario, you get an n-fold speed-up of the serial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithm.  (For a couple reasons having to do with how real hardware
</em><br>
works,
<br>
<em>&gt;you can actually have super-linear scalability for a very miniscule set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems, but that is neither here nor there.)  What is an example of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithm that is qualitatively different on a parallel system versus a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serial one?
</em><br>
<p>The point is that there ARE NO ALGORITHMS in the brain. This
<br>
&quot;symbolisation&quot; doesn't exist in nature, and in massively parallel
<br>
DISTRIBUTED systems (not transputers or just multiple von Neumann
<br>
processors) no algorithms or programs are fed into the system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In this case, it is essentially an argument from ignorance, as both of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are missing fundamental information.
</em><br>
<p>Speak for yourself!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is literally no practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference between hardware and software.  Obviously, though I don't see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like you do either.  Consider the following bits of information:
</em><br>
<p>Not only aren't there any 'programs' in mpd systems (just weight states!)
<br>
but is also the case that internal representations (of back-propagation
<br>
machines, especially combined wiv vector quantisation &amp; learning
<br>
reinforcement or IAC) cannot be meaningfully analysed. We just have
<br>
input and output results (plus math models of the ARCHITECTURE).
<br>
<p>1) to 3) irrelevant!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Assuming that these three facts are true, then it is necessarily possible
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;express all tested aspects of the mind on an ordinary computer.  With
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient software capability for adaptive algorithm construction (a hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software problem, but a solvable one), you could clone every aspect of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human mind that behaves like an FSM.  At what point does the software
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running on an ordinary computer fail to be sentient, when it has reached
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;point of being indistinguishable from the human?  The only real out
</em><br>
provided
<br>
<em>&gt;is the possibility that some part of the mind is not a piece of FSM, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hat is looking pretty unlikely at this point.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry James, but 'ordinary' von Neumann machines will never be sentient.
<br>
<p>Forget finite-state hardware ... the distinction between virtual (phantom
<br>
in MVT parlance) and &quot;physical&quot; (either E1-brain or silicon) is crucial
<br>
in this debate since we are discussing 'felt' experience, not computation.
<br>
<p>First you have to have solved the mind-body problem in more general
<br>
terms so as to overcome Leibnitz' objections to Dualism. MVT solves
<br>
these theoretical questions ... no other approach comes close, nor
<br>
ever will! Sorry if you &quot;don't see it&quot; like me ... I look at things from
<br>
my post-human perspective ... let's see which of us comes up wiv the
<br>
goods first! My main concern is wiv mental health &amp; diagnosis, I think
<br>
there is plenty of under-utilised humanoid intelligence, and we should
<br>
use MVT mainly to boost our own levels of intelligence and sentience.
<br>
<p>The Posthuman.Org welcomes genuine neural net AI research associates
<br>
to assist with our program for MVT-based machines, but please contact
<br>
me off-list, there really isn't much point of contact between MVT &amp; old
<br>
era theoretical world views, and I don't want to clutter this list with
<br>
arguments. Go ahead with your finite-state efforts for sure though, prove
<br>
me wrong (ha).
