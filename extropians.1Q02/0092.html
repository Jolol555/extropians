<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Transhuman Mailing List
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hello Forrest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for this interesting post, and happy new year to you (and everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else here, of course) .
</em><br>
<p>Hello Remi,
<br>
<p>Thank you kindly for this well-met reply. My current cognitve model of your recently-passed state brings pleasure. Perhaps that
<br>
seems pedantic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm personally a big advocate of the necessity of &quot;holistic systems&quot; (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more exactly of the value of &quot;hierarchy of levels of descriptions&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>I use the terms &quot;pictures&quot; or &quot;models&quot; rather than holistic/reductionist, higher/lower order or hierarchical. The attempted choice
<br>
of neutral terms is made so as not to introduce a synthetic framework that may bias the valuation of the means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand complex systems such as social systems or human psychology. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis on the notion of &quot;level of description&quot; implies that I am perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious that these &quot;holistic systems&quot; are in fact in the eye of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer and cannot be said to &quot;exist&quot; in an objective way. But, contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, I also consider the lower model of description as being in the eye of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the observer, and possesses no more &quot;objective&quot; value than the higher one.
</em><br>
<p>This may be a claim to psychic powers, or simply an acknowledgement of the paucity of detail in your past cognitve model of me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (especially when this low-level model implies impractical and undoable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought experiments, as we'll see below). I think your model corresponds to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the biologist and philosopher Henri Atlan called &quot;strong reductionism&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which he opposes to &quot;weak reductionism&quot;. The second one is a practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to the scientific method, defined as the necessity to search the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components of a system in order to understand its inner workings. &quot;strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reductionism&quot; on the contrary, is a purely philosophical position claiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all the levels of descriptions can and should be eliminated in favor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lowest one: in other words: sociology is &quot;eliminated&quot; by psychology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology is eliminated by neuroscience, neuroscience is eliminated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecular biology, and so on until quantum physics, which becomes the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;true&quot; explicative model of anything in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I am not familiar with Mr. Atlans's method of the gradation of 'pictures'. I seem to recall your writing about this two or three
<br>
years ago, it sounds interesting.
<br>
<p>for my edification, from Webster's 3rd-
<br>
holism 1: the philosophic theory first formulated by Jan C. Smuts that the determining factors in nature are wholes (as organisms)
<br>
which are irreducible to the sum of their parts and that the evolution of the universe is the record of the activity and making of
<br>
these wholes  2: a theory or doctrine according to which a whole cannot be analyzed without residue into the sum of its parts or
<br>
reduced to discrete elements- compare gestalt psychology, organicism
<br>
<p>holist ...&lt;a [holist] who denied that the English state, for example, is a logical construction out of individual people, and who
<br>
asserted that it is an organism which develops, and responds to challenges, according to holistic laws- J. W. N. Watkins&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, how about that.
<br>
<p>Flipping the telescope around we have a different picture of holism/reductionism:
<br>
The notion that the physical structures of civilization resemble a &quot;superorganism&quot; is sometimes put forth. It has some utility, as
<br>
the functions and evolved structures of these artifacts appear to have analogs in the biological realm. These structures appear to
<br>
be visible from space as well as from the surface and airspace of Earth. To model them, it is useful to construct them from their
<br>
holistic parts, just as in biology. The reductionist view of considering the whole thing as a single part would not permit this kind
<br>
of analysis.
<br>
The classical F=ma (force identifies with mass times acceleration) appears to hold, within the limits of spacetime metric, proper
<br>
inertial reference frame, and measurement, throughout the known universe. It is universal and holistic in the sense that it cannot
<br>
be reduced to the sum of its parts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Consider a planet with a single human being, &quot;Party A&quot;, on it- there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups of humans real or imagined. Add one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other person, &quot;Party B&quot;, that is able to communicate, or engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transactions, with the first; this forms an intermittent dyad-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fundamental economic unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is an example of what I call an undoable impractical [thought] experiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social sciences, have, unfortunately, not the level of rigor of life science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or physics. Nevertheless, reality exists, and everybody wanting to work in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this field is invited to find his examples and ideas in the rich palette of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history or anthropology. the fact is that this experience means nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody knows how a human being living alone outside of any cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction can look like. Every of us, since the birth, is immersed in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete network of relationships with our parents, our relatives, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peers. Even if, by an incredibly sadistic act, a scientist was able to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two children , each closed in his/her own cupboard, until the age of ten,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they meet together, what the scientist would obtain would be almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly an extremely pathological and dysfunctional model of human
</em><br>
<p>The experiment was introduced with a minimum set of requirements in order to isolate the system behavior of interest. The prior
<br>
history of the humans (say, beamed down to the planet -  a common SF theme) could be anything; that of any three persons. This tool
<br>
was developed to accomplish a very specific task- the demonstration of the non-existence of &quot;residues&quot;: invisible freinds, such as
<br>
the State. An alternative technique was offered in the last paragraph:
<br>
<p>&quot;The procedure can be continued indefinitely, adding more persons to the system and restricting the groupings to arbitrary
<br>
spacetime intervals without loss of generality. A similar procedure of decomposition by arbitrary groups in arbitrary intervals
<br>
acheives the same result.&quot;
<br>
<p>The gedankenexperimenter is completely free to select these groups, systems, subsystems, time-sensitive networks of relationships,
<br>
or whatever she wishes to call them. One could select the entire living quasi-human population within the Earth's sphere of
<br>
influence on or about Jan 1, 2002 as a starting point for example. Mr. Mises uses a composition/decomposition by membership in
<br>
various groups. One can also compose/decompose by the putative nature of transactions, or their time and place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; relation. [ A human is a] relational animal who cannot in any way be reduced to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;atomistic&quot; individual
</em><br>
<p>This is a very strong statement. To adapt this position would deny a scientist use of a great many experimental and analytical
<br>
tools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;.and, when it is, this kind of reductionism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly at least as abstract, subjective, and theoretical that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary approach, which is define each of us by its position in a global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I also notice (and this is IMNSHO, a very sad habit among transhumanists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians) that you apparently consider the economic relationship as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic form of relation. I think this rather crude model (two independent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational agents exchanging informations and goods)
</em><br>
<p>I am using &quot;economic&quot; in a very generic sense, apparently different from your interpretation. I should have used &quot;human action&quot;,
<br>
&quot;praxeology&quot;, or &quot;interaction&quot; instead.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...'Economic man' was a theoretical device or concept by which the classical economists endeavored to distill man's economic
<br>
behavior from the rest of his being-often with ludicrous results, as you can imagine. Misesian praxeology, rather than perpetuating
<br>
this error, corrects it. Mises abandoned the convoluted efforts to pretend, for the sake of economic analysis, that humans were
<br>
coldly calculating, soulless, profit-maximizing beings. Instead, he readily acknowledged that humans are complex beings whose
<br>
economic behavior is informed and influenced by the unique, ever-changing combination of the various religious, psychological,
<br>
biological motivations (his values, goals, perceptions, desires, and the like) competing for supremacy within the individual as he
<br>
is confronted with the particular set of circumstances surrounding him at a given point in time. Mises emphatically eschewed as
<br>
futile and impossible any attempt to separate economic action from the totality of the individual.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the individual human consciousness, economic values and ethical values coexist and often affect each other...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is utterly unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encompass the extreme subtility of human relation, phenomena like affective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationships, desire, hate or love between individuals, or complex cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena like religion, customs or ideologies in social systems. I prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider the economic model as a simplified system which may be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler situation, such as trade, but without value for an historian, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropologist, a psychologist or a sociologist. I frequently noticed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist frequently think in term of simpler relationships
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trade/peaceful or war/conflict, and this is one of the main reason they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely unable to understand the subtleties of social interaction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore act in a meaningful way. This recall me, some years ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion in Stockholm during Transvsion 98 , about transhumanism weakness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in philosophy. It's not important to be able to quote Plato or Aristotle in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original greek text, but it's about acknowledging the  complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human behavior, and, above all, to accept to work with real situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of abstract nonexistent models.
</em><br>
<p>Models of reality are all we have to work with.
