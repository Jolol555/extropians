</em><br>
<p>That in itself is a very different issue.  The points of the paper which we 
<br>
addressed where the negatively planted commentary which is both inaccurate 
<br>
and subjective.  Thus, James could have said reference such points he makes 
<br>
as &quot;In my opinion ...&quot; or &quot;It seems to me ...&quot;
<br>
<p>Frankly, I do not like being used inappropriately and I certainly do not 
<br>
like having  my values placed along in the same cell with anti-humanity 
<br>
ideals.  I think Eliezer stoutly and appropriately addressed  his concerns 
<br>
with James estimation of the Singularity.  If I had time, I would have 
<br>
taken apart sentences and paragraphs, which I will do, and which I promised 
<br>
James I would do, at a later date.
<br>
<p>Inasmuch, the paper is not *middle ground*.
<br>
<p>Now, moving forward:
<br>
<p>Have you read FM-2030?  He, above all else, represents the middle person on 
<br>
the street - guy or gal.  His ideology is focused largely on politics and 
<br>
his book reflects his particular philosophical approach to 
<br>
Transhumanism.  It may not be your approach, or mine, but there is no doubt 
<br>
in my mind that it was written for the &quot;people&quot; -- everyone who he believed 
<br>
was or could be interested in the nature of transhumanity.
<br>
<p>In respect to democracy, the democratic aspects of Transhumanism has a bit 
<br>
of a background which James did miss in his paper, if he represents 
<br>
democracy as being of the people, and a political party which has changed 
<br>
over the years and which does not hold strict party policy as it once 
<br>
did.  When we consider politics of the people,  let's consider the lateral 
<br>
landscape which is inclusive of a number of parties, and I would not elect 
<br>
to outcast the Republican party.  The Republican party has many 
<br>
advantageous ideas and promises for the person on the street - from Rodeo 
<br>
Drive to South Central.
<br>
<p>While I am no longer a Green elected official, my platform was 
<br>
&quot;Transhumans&quot; and it was for the &quot;people&quot; *and* the focus was environmental 
<br>
issues and the use of smart technology. We may laugh at the Green party, 
<br>
but here in Southern California is a pretty darn good means to infiltrate 
<br>
the public arena.  My former political colleague is now mayor of Santa 
<br>
Monica, a very &quot;people&quot; oriented community and a globally visible community.
<br>
<p>However, here issue is not just politics, but authenticity.  In that we 
<br>
cannot label any transhumanist group with a political lean unless and until 
<br>
such group makes a declaration of such.  The bigger issue here is pitting 
<br>
one group against another by inference. Is such inference is weak then the 
<br>
premise needs to be addressed.
<br>
<p>When I think of the politics of transhumanism, I think of a future oriented 
<br>
sensibility, not based on 20th Century political dogma.  In that the basic 
<br>
understanding of transhumanism is a better world for humankind, it would be 
<br>
paradoxical not to enrich a transhumanist philosophical outlook with a 
<br>
positive intention for &quot;people on the street&quot;, if they are willing and 
<br>
wanting.   And even if they are not, certainly a banner of welcoming of 
<br>
humanity exists within this sentiment.
