Don't you have a lot better things to do?  I think there system 
<br>
is suffering some serious bugs AND they have a policy of 
<br>
deleting non-premium accounts if they aren't used at least once 
<br>
every so often (forget if it is 3 weeks or a month but in that 
<br>
range).  However, after many tries I wasn't able to set up a new 
<br>
account except from a PC.  So something is technically wrong. 
<br>
They might be under attack for what you or I know.  So treating 
<br>
them as villians or even incompetents doesn't seem terribly 
<br>
productive.
