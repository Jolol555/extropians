<p>John I see where you are coming from but still I disagree.  I have
<br>
personally been thru the heartbreak of Alzheimer's twice, once with
<br>
my grandfather and once with Shelly's.  In both cases, the men retained
<br>
their sexual desire up to the end, or perhaps in even increased.  In
<br>
both cases, they were married, and in both cases, they were not
<br>
allowed to have sexual relations with their spouses!  I found this
<br>
most disturbing.
<br>
<p>In my grandfather's case, he was physically very healthy and he
<br>
owned a looooot of money.  He had an excellent facility, one
<br>
nurse available around the clock for each four patients.  But no
<br>
sex.  I dont understand why that should be.
<br>
<p>My grandfather was an inventor and he knew Alzheimers was
<br>
eventually going to claim him, well in advance.  Had he just a
<br>
little more time, perhaps it would have occurred to him to try to
<br>
put together devices to comfort him during the bewildering brain
<br>
decay and declining period.
<br>
<p>I find it unconscionable that a person with sufficient wealth
<br>
would get in a situation where they could not use that accumulated
<br>
captal to buy extra comfort.  Rich people should be able to
<br>
buy fun, even after their brains are shot, after they get to the
<br>
point where a prostitute would be unlikely to be much help.
<br>
<p>In Shelly's grandfather's case, they gave him lingerie ads
<br>
from the Penny's catalog, which he thoroughly enjoyed, but I
<br>
really feel we could do better than that.  {Jeez, couldn't we even
<br>
pop for a Victoria's Secret catalog fer cryin out loud?}  I partially
<br>
blame myself for not sufficiently researching the market to see
<br>
if sexual stimulation devices were already available in the mid
<br>
1980s for Alzheimer's patients.  spike
