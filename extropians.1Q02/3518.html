</em><br>
<p>um. sorry? I really didn't mean to convey errors. I was just tickled
<br>
pink by the page, and preserved the incorrect tranparent aluminum title
<br>
to keep the link to that old star trek movie clear.(and because i thought
<br>
it was funny). My ignorance of most materials science also contributed
<br>
to the hyped and unhelpful tone of the rest. Enthusiasm, it's a killer.
<br>
<p>Then Mike Lorrey said:
<br>

<em>&gt; On the contrary, ceramic materials are the new thing in body armor
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; 1/4&quot; plate of sintered ceramic between a couple thin sheets of kevlar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Effective against AP rifle rounds, even.
</em><br>
<p>This is very interesting to me. I was previously aware of ceramic rifle-stopper
<br>
plates in the front and back of level III-c vests, but I didn't know
<br>
that it was that effective. Do you know who produced those? They are
<br>
prototype, I assume, as a google doesn't bring up anything like that,
<br>
precisely...
<br>
<p>Anyone have links to a good online explanatory page for some basic materials
<br>
science terminology and such, just so I don't have to collect quite so
<br>
many corrective posts, when i discover another exciting lil page?
<br>
<p>Hmm, also, springboarding off that, into weapons R&amp;D, anybody know what
<br>
happened to all those directed energy weapons I was promised? I'm positive
<br>
I remember reading about particle accelerator cannons, MASERs, LASERs,
<br>
and microwave weapons as a child. Now that I am a grown googler,I cannot
<br>
seem to find anything on the subject that doesn't bring up old Military
<br>
&quot;investigative studies&quot;, vague governmental frontpages to think tanks,
<br>
or video game sites. 
<br>
<p>All the &quot;dangerouslabs.org&quot; kind of sites are actually kind of dissapointing.
<br>
Just little jet-powered carts and so-on, I remember building an ion &quot;cannon&quot;
<br>
as a young teen, and disturbing electronics from a distance, and other
<br>
malicious electronic weapons. 
<br>
<p>Anyone know what kind of legislation governs the private production of
<br>
directed energy weapons, hipower lasers, or directed emp weapons?
<br>
On a related note, does the legislation on automatic and explosive firearms
<br>
cover privately developed, prototype, or handbuilt non-commercial weapons?
