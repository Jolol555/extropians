<p><p>Actually, I am not at all clear that we fully can yet or that

doing so would actually not tremendously backfire politically

and economically.  I very much want to believe we can however.

But the attempts to do so, halfhearted as they were and even 
<br>
within the borders of highly developled countries, have been 
<br>
pretty dismal to date.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Compared to most of agricultural history the Singularity has already
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; population works directly producing food (although more may be building
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; housing is cheap, life expectancies are at record highs...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, housing is not cheap relative to income in much of the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;US and there are still far too many under- as well as 
<br>
malnourished people even here.  The problem is that our economic 
<br>
model has not shifted to &quot;post-industrial&quot;, to the place where 
<br>
all of the adults working in a paying job is no longer required 
<br>
to take care of all the real needs and most of the wants of the 
<br>
population.  Our model is based on continuing climbing 
<br>
production and consumption.  This cannot be acheived without 
<br>
indefinitely without creating cancerous economic growths.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You want a Singularity?  Wotcha waiting for?  Sure, there's more work to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>But not surplus enough to convince enough people to quit playing

<p><em>&gt; netting to fight malaria, or clean water...)
