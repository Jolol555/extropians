Hi,
<br>
<p>I just had an interesting thought on an alternative to progressive income
<br>
taxes, which always had anti-progressive consequences in my opinion.
<br>
<p>Suppose income taxes were eliminated altogether and replaced with a
<br>
marginally higher tax on capital gains (not more than 30%).  The government
<br>
would have to tighten its belt for a few years, but the net effect may
<br>
actually be what the progressive income tax claims to be and isn't.  There
<br>
are a number of apparent consequences to this.  Overall, this looks like a
<br>
more promising way of bootstrapping people from low affluence to moderately
<br>
high levels of affluence.
<br>
<p>First, you would probably see a substantial rise in savings and investment
<br>
as people have substantially more disposable cash, allowing people to become
<br>
modestly affluent much faster if they desire.  Second, as the number of
<br>
affluent people increases as a percentage of the population, there will
<br>
likely be a growth in capital availability which will fuel economic
<br>
expansion and boost wages.  Third, as more of the population becomes
<br>
significantly invested in capital investments, the government will see its
<br>
tax revenue increase; the government would be motivated to see that people
<br>
become very affluent in this system, whereas today they are motivated to
<br>
keep people in the middle class.  Because people still earning an income are
<br>
unlikely to convert capital investments very often, they would be able to
<br>
enjoy the wealth building properties of capital investment without the drag
<br>
of taxes.
<br>
<p>There are downsides as well, but off-hand it seems like a constructive
<br>
system (at least insofar as any tax system can be considered
<br>
&quot;constructive&quot;).  Income taxes never taxed anyone but the middle class for
<br>
the most part, and &quot;progressive&quot; income taxes actually make it even worse.
<br>
Income taxes don't rise in proportion to affluence, and there is no way for
<br>
them to do so.  Capital gains taxes on the other hand, do tend to increase
<br>
as a function of real wealth for people.  The real trick is keeping the
<br>
capital gains tax low enough that it doesn't discourage investment.  This
<br>
means that initially the government would have far less money, but in the
<br>
long run they could make it up in volume and have a lot fewer poor people to
<br>
use as poster children for pork projects.
<br>
<p>I still oppose taxes in general, but this seems a lot better to me than the
<br>
stupidity of &quot;progressive&quot; income taxes if you are REALLY interested in
<br>
helping the working man.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
