<em>&gt; They might be under attack for what you or I know.  So treating

</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that they have not cancelled my old account at all,
<br>
despite my not using it for many months. I am unable to set up a new
<br>
account using the same name, and the system is inaccessible once you've
<br>
entered your passphrase.
<br>
<p>If they are having problems, all they have to do is to send out emails
<br>
to customers about difficulties, and to respond to support reqests. It
<br>
is obvious that they are providing extremely poor service, and I intend
<br>
to make sure, as a proper player in the free market, that my signal to
<br>
other consumers is properly heard.
<br>
<p>And, no, I don't have a lot better things to do. The job situation
<br>
around here still stinks, nobody is hiring at the moment.
