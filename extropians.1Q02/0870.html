</em><br>
<p>Right.  But sci-fi writers want to spin yarns on time scales
<br>
that will hold the interest of non-uploaded humans.  This
<br>
puts too many unnecessary restrictions on our thinking.
<br>
<p>Last time Robert was here, we did a series of calculations
<br>
that I tried to recall last night, but I dropped three orders
<br>
of magnitude.  I just redid those calcs.  First I will go into
<br>
more detail on how an advanced civilization could drag
<br>
along its entire star and why that would be a good idea
<br>
to do so.
<br>
<p>Imagine a star with a flat ring of material in orbit (a bit like
<br>
the planet Saturn) and assume the mass of the ring at one
<br>
milli-star.  Now assume the ring made of individual particles
<br>
that are capable of reflecting the photons from the star in
<br>
any direction they want.  Now imagine the star bisected
<br>
by a plane, such as the table top at which you may be sitting,
<br>
and the ring in that plane.  If every particle in that ring reflects
<br>
the photons downward, then the entire ring is lifted slightly
<br>
above the plane of that table.  Even tho the individual particles
<br>
no longer pass thru the equatorial plane of the star, the orbit is
<br>
stable.  The mass of the ring exerts a slight gravitational
<br>
attraction on the star, gently tugging it in the direction opposite
<br>
the way the photons are deflected.  The star/ring system becomes
<br>
an enormous photon driven spacecraft.
<br>
<p>Next time Rob Bradbury suggests taking the solar system
<br>
apart and making an MBrain, recall that the mass of everything
<br>
in the solar system outside of the sun is not far from one
<br>
milli-sun, ignoring the hydrogen and helium, which likely
<br>
cannot be used.
<br>
<p>Now realize that if the particles can reflect and can control
<br>
their attitude, they can adjust their orbits over time.  This can
<br>
be done without violating any laws of conservation of angular
<br>
momentum.  If this is not clear how to tip an orbit using only
<br>
light pressure, ask and I will go over the reasoning.  The rings
<br>
that exist even in the plane of the direction of motion would
<br>
have an offset CG, and would contribute to tugging the star.
<br>
<p>If the individual particles can adjust their orbits, both radius
<br>
and inclination, I can imagine no reason whatsoever why
<br>
in principle an MBrain could not be constructed from the
<br>
planets.  Nearly every photon that leaves the sun could
<br>
be reflected in the same direction, making the star system
<br>
a maximum efficiency photon propelled rocket.
<br>
<p>Now, here is where I dropped 3 orders of magnitude last
<br>
night.  I am pulling all the following numbers out of biomemory,
<br>
so if any of them are way wrong, do correct me:
<br>
<p>At one earth radius, 1.5E11m, the solar insolation is about 1340
<br>
watts per square meter, (I think) and the energy of each photon is
<br>
h*nu and the momentum of each photon is h*nu/c.  So for each
<br>
photon deflected, the h*nu cancels, so we can take the total area
<br>
of the ring, estimate the energy that falls upon it and divide by c
<br>
and that is the momentum transfer.  Assuming an MBrain covers
<br>
the entire surface of the star, everything cancels and we find that
<br>
the thrust available is the total energy the star emits over c.  This
<br>
relation works regardless of the radius at which the rings of
<br>
material exist, so we could use nested rings of individual orbitting
<br>
particles, Bradbury style.
<br>
<p>Examples of calcs on this:
<br>
<p>One AU = 1.5E11 meters,
<br>
Area of a sphere at that radius = 2.8E23 m^2
<br>
Solar energy that fall on that sphere = 3.8E26 Watt
<br>
Force exerted by momentum of all those photons = 1.3E18 newtons
<br>
Mass of the sun = 2E30 kg
<br>
Maximum acceleration of the sun possible = 6.3E-13 m/sec^2
<br>
<p>or about 2E-5 m/sec/yr
<br>
or 630 meters per square year, if you prefer to think in square years.
<br>
<p>Last night I was thinking it was about 3 cm/sec per year, but turns out
<br>
its only 20 microns per second per year.  But whats 3 orders of magnitude
<br>
between friends?  Furthermore, whats the hurry?  We need not suffer
<br>
any discomfort on this trip to the nearest star, which if I recall is about
<br>
<p>4 light years away, or 2E16 m, so the trip will take about 11 million
<br>
years,
<br>
or about 16 million if you want to reverse thrust and actually stop once
<br>
you
<br>
get there.  The nested shells of individual particles could be arranged
<br>
well
<br>
outside the earth's orbit, if we wanted to keep this planet for a wildlife
<br>
refuge, historical site, etc.  The only change the earthbound observer
<br>
would notice would be a total absence of stars.
<br>
<p>Does 16 million years seem too long for a trip?  How old will we be
<br>
in 16 million years if we dont go?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can go quickly in a small ship --
</em><br>
<p>But why suffer the discomfort of a small ship?  Whats the hurry?
<br>
The sun wont significantly change in that much time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to keep in mind the problem of the lack of &quot;current&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. ...We are ~24,000 l.y from the center,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never mind the other side.
</em><br>
<p>Patience, Grahsshoppah...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can never know what the &quot;reality&quot; is outside of a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local region of space.  So chasing after a star 10 l.y. away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may make sense.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Then when we get there, we take that star and
<br>
start chasing the next one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Chasing after a star 100 l.y. away is iffy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chasing after a star 1000 l.y. away seems really silly --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have no way of assuring it will still be there when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally arrive.
</em><br>
<p>But new ones may be born by then.  Each time you are
<br>
always chasing the nearest one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One point that wasn't clear to me from Spike's post was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the point was of going to another system.  You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harvest material from the stars quickly.  So the only thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can do is rip off the planetary material.
</em><br>
<p>Or make new, by merging the two stars to catalyze a
<br>
supernova, which would create new metals.  I can imagine
<br>
the universe has plenty of energy but is metal-starved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It looks to me like advanced civilizations should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detect MBrains.  You can see them either by their microlensing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signatures or slight variations in the background temperature.
</em><br>
<p>But sufficiently advanced MBrains might not let very many
<br>
photons leak out, or may intentionally mask them for fear of
<br>
some crazy yahoo coming to merge her star with yours, hoping
<br>
to create a supernova.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The maximum amount of material - millions of stars worth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be in large gas clouds (the question is is it cheaper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to collect it there than extracting it from a stellar gravity well).
</em><br>
<p>The problem I see is that those clouds are nearly all hydrogen
<br>
and we want metals.  Now if you can propose a way to fuse
<br>
hydrogen and be able to keep the remaining material, without
<br>
using up too much of the scarce metals we already have...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that MBrains don't have to &quot;fight&quot; -- not at this stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of development in the Universe.
</em><br>
<p>Lets hope not.  {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There are lots of brown dwarfs to feed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on.  But if MBrains can detect other MBrains and if one subscribes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;fighting&quot; scenario, one would want to avoid any region of space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another MBrain could reach by the time you could get there.  As the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MBrain population of a galaxy  increases, it would seem that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require expanding outward occupying an increasing volume of space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the galaxy.
</em><br>
<p>Thats right.  I can imagine an entire galaxy winking out over a period
<br>
of a billion years, all from a single Singularity.  Here one eon, gone the
<br>
next.  Could be that we evolved just in time to see the final stages of
<br>
our own galaxy going dark.
<br>
<p>Counter evidence: all galaxies are mostly dark matter?  We couldn't
<br>
have caught *all* of them in that stage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus the really long term prospects for SIs do not appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be very good to me at this point (unless you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoke magic physics).  Robert
</em><br>
<p>No magic physics.  An MBrain could theoretically be constructed
<br>
using entirely that set of physical laws which are well understood today,
<br>
which we have understood since the time of Newton (with the
<br>
exception of how these individual particles in the MBrain would
<br>
be controlled.  That breakthru insight came about only since
<br>
we developed microprocessors and lasers.)
<br>
<p>Looks to me like we need only a Singularity to figure out how
<br>
to unify the existing earthbound intelligent nodes, organize the
<br>
collective will of those intelligences, and we are on our way,
<br>
perhaps within 50 yrs.  Friends, we are standing on the
<br>
threshold of a dream.  spike
