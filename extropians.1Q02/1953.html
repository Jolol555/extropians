</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Is there any evidence to suggest a link between autism and birth / early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;parenting methods? I read some while ago that this was the case but have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;been unable to find any reference to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Judith Harris, in a book called The Nurture Assumption, makes a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument against the general claim that parenting methods affect
</em><br>
children's
<br>
<em>&gt; behavior outside of the home. She specifically says that &quot;autistic
</em><br>
children
<br>
<em>&gt; are born that way&quot;, but doesn't refer to any evidence that is specific to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autism. (Simon Baron-Cohen, the autism researcher quoted at the start of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this thread, describes The Nurture Assumption as &quot;shockingly persuasive&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The book Shadow Syndromes, which has a good chapter on autism, says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Autism is not caused by bad parents&quot;, but it also fails to cite any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific evidence to support that claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I was referring mainly to birth methods and very early childcare, ie the
<br>
first few hours after birth. The research that was mentioned to me was
<br>
implying that autism is the result of failure to meet the requirements of
<br>
biology at and just after birth. I haven't been able to find the relevant
<br>
publications about this. Just wanted to make it plain, I'm not talking about
<br>
'bad' parenting here, I'm talking about the possibility of damage done
<br>
through ignorance, by some current medical practices...?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;  It sure looks to me like the increased ability of autistic people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce is a significant part of the increase in people diagnosed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autistic, although changing criteria for diagnosis probably play a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think it's misleading to credit the airplane for enabling people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change their culture. The automobile was more important at doing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than air travel was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I also doubt that a mildly autistic person is more readily accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in places where cultural differences make social oddness more normal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the main effect is that it has become easier for mildly autistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to find cultures (such as that of Silicon Valley) that attract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other mildly autistic people, and therefore become cultures that seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less foreign.
