<em>&gt;The Irish Government has approved plans for the world's largest offshore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electricity-generating wind farm, to be built on a sandbank in the Irish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sea south of Dublin.
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1755000/1755413.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1755000/1755413.stm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When completed, the 200 turbines will produce 10% of the country's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electricity needs.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A report published this week said that wind-generated electricity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;production jumped by 31% last year, making it the most rapidly growing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;branch of the power industry.
</em><br>
<p>I'm kind of shocked to see this happening.  It's the sort of thing that 
<br>
gets talked about but never done.  Kind of like recycling programmes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One megawatt of wind-generating capacity typically will satisfy the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electricity needs of 350 households in an industrial society, or roughly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1,000 people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The plant's capacity will ultimately reach 520 megawatts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The state will receive up to 1.9 million euros ($1.7m) a year from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eirtricity in rentals and royalties.
</em><br>
<p>It's only pocket change of course, but this project might just put a fire 
<br>
under some of the other EU nations who would also have suitable 
<br>
conditions.  After all, can't have the Irish owning the largest offshore 
<br>
wind facility in the world, now can we? :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Mr Fahey said there had been wide public consultation on the plan and no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objections. Eight submissions had been received, all of them in favour.
</em><br>
<p>This is very impressive.  If you go to any local meeting, residents 
<br>
association, public consultations, chances are very, very good that someone 
<br>
will be objecting to whatever development is being proposed.  It's almost a 
<br>
tradition......
<br>
<p>If it were possible, I'd like to see another two of the south coast.  Now 
<br>
that'd be a serious amount of energy generation.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
