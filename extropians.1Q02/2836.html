<em>&gt; Yet why is it that both alcohol and gambling are legal activities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adults in most jurisdictions in the US, yet many perfectly normal adults
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely ruin their lives, and the lives of others (spouse/children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going homeless/malnourished, drunk driving homicides and injuries, etc)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the criminality of the substance were the only factor as you claim,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then alcholics and gambling addicts should have no negative impact on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society. The fact they do have one disproves the criminality theory.
</em><br>
<p>There's no reason to resort the silly simplistic black-and-white
<br>
thinking here.  We're obviously talking matters of degree, not
<br>
fundamental nature. Yes, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling lead to
<br>
some social problems in those who don't deal well with them--but
<br>
far /fewer/ problems than medically similar things that happen
<br>
to be illegal.  Alcohol and tobacco companies don't create street
<br>
gangs, kill judges, bribe police, etc.  Those acitivities carry
<br>
a high cost, which is only borne by drug dealers because the laws
<br>
drive prices high enough to cover.  Without the laws, things like
<br>
marijuana and cocaine would cause social problems about on the
<br>
level of what alcohol does now--that's not zero, but it's quite
<br>
tolerable, and we've learned as a society how to deal with it.
<br>
<p>I should also point out that the case of gambling addiction
<br>
actually weakens your argument: you contend that illegal drugs
<br>
reduce one's capacity for responsible action, and that's true
<br>
(just as it is equally true of legal drugs).  But clearly that
<br>
isn't the case with an activity like gambling,  so you can't
<br>
blame anti-social addictive behavior on the chemical unless the
<br>
effect of that chemical is well beyond the expected variation
<br>
in human behavior.  You could probably make that case for PCP,
<br>
heroin, meth, and alcohol. You probably couldn't make that case
<br>
for marijuana, LSD, or tobacco.  Marijuana in particular is about
<br>
the silliest case I can imagine: widespread use would probably
<br>
reduce violence and benefit society immeasurably.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I agree that the state should not regulate intake by adults (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point which I have NEVER disputed, by the way), this does not mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addicts should not be held accountable for their actions just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and criminals are. Users should be required by their insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carriers (even in a libertarian setting) to adequately insure against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the externalities of their potential bad behavior while impaired and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addicted. If they do take care of this risk, then they can toke up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my blessing.
</em><br>
<p>I could be persuaded that users of a drug that carries proven risks
<br>
of anti-social behavior might be required to mitigate the risk.  The
<br>
one drug that creates the most risk in that regard is clearly alcohol,
<br>
and we do have fairly reasonable laws to mitigate that risk: strict
<br>
drunk-driving penalties, regulations on bars and liquor stores, etc.
<br>
It's actually a pretty good model for what regulation of other drugs
<br>
might look like in a more reasonable society (though arbitrary age
<br>
limits are silly).  And of course, such laws should /only/ apply to
<br>
those drugs proven to pose risks to others, and not things like LSD and
<br>
marijuana.
