</em><br>
<p>Interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another sick joke: the Enron employee relief fund: 1000's and 1000's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dollars for relief for the poor Enron employees--what a joke: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; median income of Enron employees is probably at least 45K...boo hooo!
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your sentiment -- to some degree.  It's not funny to see
<br>
anyone lose their retirement fund, but there are people who are much
<br>
worse off.  In a way, seeing them paraded before Congress reminds me of
<br>
those rich people who want the government to help them rebuild after the
<br>
mud slides in CA in the 1980s.  These were like $2 million homes, IIRC,
<br>
that insurance companies wouldn't touch because of their location.  By
<br>
no means were these people going to be living in dumpsters if the
<br>
government didn't help them rebuild...
<br>
<p>That said, it's still a sad story, though one that shouldn't overwhelm
<br>
our reason.  The same is going on now in NYC where the Red Cross is
<br>
doling out money to people who really don't need it.  This makes me a
<br>
bit angry because I donated some money to them specifically to help the
<br>
victims of September 11.  I thought my money -- I'm not bragging here,
<br>
it wasn't that much money -- would go to things like medical help for
<br>
people who were injured or assistance for the poor people put out of
<br>
work.  Instead, much of it is just being giving away door to door to
<br>
people who live in apartments that rent for more than monthly income.
<br>
(This is according to an NPR report.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile the working poor typically are completely ignored by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass media--the poor darlings don't patronize the advertisers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support the media, dontcha know....and as for the inner city welfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor, well, the mass media certainly wouldn't ignore them--otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would destroy the property of the business class, the true bosses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the media, who buy the ads.
</em><br>
<p>While I'm against welfare in all its forms -- including corporate
<br>
welfare -- I agree here.  There are certain groups in society which it's
<br>
okay to ignore and others that are the official repositories of
<br>
sympathy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;For the rest of this article, see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north92.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north92.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, lewrockwell is a great site. It is good to see people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually think original thoughts, as opposed to being an empty vessel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for memes backed by money.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  I find the site to be provocative -- even when I don't agree with
<br>
it.  I hope others will look at it too, though, I hope, they will come
<br>
to it looking for truths rather than just another line to swallow.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
