<em>&gt; As I have asked many times here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't really been answered, what happens when there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market due to automation and continually more sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, for anyone with less than a certain amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general intelligence and a fair amount of training?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...] The &quot;job&quot; paradigm may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly obsolete as may be some old economic models based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in more scarcity and less high technology.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any problem with this.  One of the things I think I said is
<br>
sometimes when buggy whips go out of style, the people involved have to figure
<br>
out for themselves a way to be productive.  Sitting around waiting for someone
<br>
else to invent a new industry and employ you won't solve the problem.  Until
<br>
everyone is happy, there will always be something to do.  Why should it be otherwise?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Increasingly it may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economically feasible to hire and train people in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies, at least not people below a certain intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of training.  What then for these people who are no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hirable?
</em><br>
<p>[I assume &quot;companies&quot; is a typo for &quot;countries&quot;.]
<br>
<p>One of the charities I give to (as I've mentioned before) is Trickle Up.  They
<br>
loan $100 to the poorest of the poor in the poorest countries to start very
<br>
simple businesses.  weaving baskets, repacking foods, watching other people's
<br>
children.  These people then hire others.  (aside:) Having read de Soto's &quot;The
<br>
Mystery of Capital&quot;, I now believe that in many of these countries one of the
<br>
biggest problems is that the poor can't get a loan on their home, even though
<br>
they are the undisputed owner of the property.  This is their biggest obstacle
<br>
to getting the small amount of capital that is required to start very simple
<br>
service businesses that contribute in substantial ways to their own and their
<br>
neighbor's lifestyles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When [immigrants] start a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family, they'll yearn for the same comforts for their children as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of us, and work as hard as it takes to make it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I still think the US can do a lot worse than provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some reasonable stipend in the form of a grant (say 12,000/yr)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to every capable adult who wishes to continue his/her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education.   The need is great to get a more educated population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and workforce and we can't wait for &quot;trickle-down&quot; to have it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure this is good incentive engineering.  (Not that I disagree with
<br>
the goal, only with whether this is the most effective way to reach it.)  When
<br>
people want an education (for themselves or their children) enough to work
<br>
overtime to get it, they value what they get and manage it wisely.  If
<br>
education is a gift or a right, many will squander it and not realize until
<br>
they finally are on their own that their choices make a difference.  That
<br>
said, I do believe that education is important.  But my and my significant
<br>
other's plan for our nieces and nephews is that we will save money (in our
<br>
name, not in a trust account that we don't really control) that we will give
<br>
them as a match for whatever they earn themselves.  This multiplies their
<br>
education earning power, but still requires that they believe in the value of
<br>
it enough to earn some of the money themselves.  If any of them turn out to be
<br>
driven and talented enough to be headed for a high-end education, we will
<br>
likely increase our contribution.  
<br>
<p>The best the government could do would be to allow any tax payer to take a
<br>
deduction for any contribution to anyone's education.  Doesn't matter whether
<br>
the student is related or not.  Same for corporations.  More education is good
<br>
for all of us, but making it an entitlement is bad for all of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The statistics (according to Julian Simon, of course) show that in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ?  I am not altogether sure I can trust Julian Simon for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics.
</em><br>
<p>Please, use any source of statistics you desire, or show any attacks on
<br>
Simon's work that provide better statistics, rather than attacking his
<br>
motivation.  Do you have any sources that disagree that the gap keeps getting
<br>
smaller?  I  think Simon's opponents are driven by envy, and think Simon's
<br>
claims are irrelevant.  If there's still a gap, then they will continue to be
<br>
unhappy.  Is this how you feel?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; cases, as technology advances, the rich do keep getting richer, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gap keeps getting proportionately smaller.  Those who worry about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have-nots, when they have statistics always show the ones that show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some people are still behind, and don't check to see whether they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; catching up.  We can argue about gradualism again, but since we agree on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the outcome, there's no need to do so here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not find the above tenable.  Especially not now when even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of very highly trained and motivated friends of mine are out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of work and have been for months.  Our system is not working all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that smoothly right now.  And I would also question relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchase power figures when it takes two wage earners in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more households today to just break reasonably even, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without a lot of consumerist over-spending, than it did in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parent's generation.  It also takes longer in many parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country and is accessible to fewer levels of income, to own a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home of one's own.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what the complaint is here.  There is a recession.  Do you think
<br>
someone is unfairly targeting the poor and middle class to take the brunt of
<br>
it?  I also have trouble figuring out how your &quot;very highly trained&quot; friends,
<br>
presumably here in Silicon Valley, could be among the have-nots that some
<br>
people are worried about.  I must be missing the point of this paragraph.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [...] though I prefer cooperation, I realize that all may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; never feel this way. I am opposed to giving away the store, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anything in return, because I believe mutuality and reciprocation are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; what guarnatees cooperation, not noble words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not open up more stores by enabling a lot of other people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so that wouldn't otherwise?  Is this not helpful to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes we care about?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't understand the point of including (either part of) this interaction. 
<br>
I disagree with Spudboy's desire for reciprocity as I think I said.  Trade is
<br>
not a prisoner's dilemma, so it's not clear that tit-for-tat is the winning
<br>
strategy.  When either side refuses to cooperate, both sides lose, so there's
<br>
little advantage in defecting first.  
<br>
<p>What are you trying to say in your response to Spudboy?  Another organization
<br>
I give money to is the Institute for Justice, which fights laws that make it
<br>
illegal for people to start businesses in many places around the country. 
<br>
They fought the taxi industry in Las Vegas which was preventing people from
<br>
starting shuttle services in underserved (minority, mostly) areas of the city.
<br>
&nbsp;They fought the regulators of the cosmetology and beauty parlor business (I
<br>
think in California) over the rights of people to charge money for braiding
<br>
people's hair without getting a license that included no training on braiding,
<br>
and was mostly an anti-competitive measure limiting entry to beauty parlors.  
<br>
<p>I realize that many of you believe that one country can take over an industry
<br>
by subsidizing it in their own country, but I don't think there are cases
<br>
where that lasts.  This seems the same accusation commonly leveled at
<br>
monopolies, that they will suffer losses in the short term in order to gouge
<br>
in the long term.  It doesn't happen in the real world unless a government is
<br>
preventing competition from entering.
