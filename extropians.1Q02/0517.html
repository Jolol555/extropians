<p><em>    &gt; Did you look at the URL that Samantha posted?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. According to that ASCII sequence, 40 years ago somebody had a
<br>
ridiculous idea that never came close to being carried out. I don't know if
<br>
a correspondence with that ASCII sequence and reality can be found but
<br>
it wouldn't surprise me if there is one, there is certainly no shortage of
<br>
harebrained ideas both in and out of government.
<br>
The relevance to 911 is of course zero.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;it IS a very, very real  possibility that it's true.
</em><br>
<p>Very very? Let me get this straight, you think the theory that best fits the
<br>
known facts, the simplest theory according to Occam's Razor is that the
<br>
American government paid the 19 Islamic Hijackers (or suicidal CIA agents)
<br>
to crash into both towers of the World Trade Center and The Pentagon and
<br>
a farmers field and blew up a Navy warship and two American embassies and
<br>
a army barracks in Saudi Arabia and killed 18 American soldiers in Somalia
<br>
and used clever computer animation to make a tape of bin laden saying he was
<br>
behind it just so that America could go to war and invade the poorest country
<br>
on Earth?
<br>
<p>I know that radically changing ones worldview is seldom pleasant and
<br>
never easy but good god man look at the bizarre mental contortions you
<br>
must use to preserve it! The facts are overwhelming that your ideas
<br>
need revision, the facts are screaming for attention both literally and
<br>
figuratively.
<br>
<p>I'd like to say something else. A while back when I got a bit hot under the
<br>
collar I wrote some stuff that some said reflected badly on the reputation of
<br>
the Extropian Institute. I admit my remarks were intemperate even if quite
<br>
correct, at least that's the way I still see it. But I'm curious what these same
<br>
people think of Dossy's post. I'd like to know what they think the effect it will
<br>
have on intelligent respectable people who read it, how will it color their
<br>
opinion of Extropians? It disturbs me that I even have to ask this question,
<br>
eight years and several thousand posts ago when I joined the answer
<br>
would have been obvious to all. This list has changed, sometimes I
<br>
wonder if it's still the place for me. The matter may be moot, after this
<br>
post I may be booted off.
