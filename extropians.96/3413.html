&lt;a potential Transhumanist Trilogy: THE Power, Omega and the Singularity.<br>
Lyle hasn't lost his sense of humor - that's what parody is, twisting <br>
things out of the context they're normally seen in, just as Lyle recently <br>
asked David Musick to substitute "corporations" for "highly advanced <br>
beings" in his The Power of Symbiosis thread to see what it sounded like.&gt;<br>
<p>
Argh, I meant to write Trinity, not Trilogy!<br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey wrote:<br>
&lt;Actually, I did not read his suggestion of substitution as a parody, <br>
because I have theorized on, as others have, of the current existence of <br>
transhuman organisms here on earth, operating at such a slow baud rate that <br>
they are not noticed by us. They are commonly referred to as a: "nation", <br>
"corporation", "government", "ethnic group", "profession", "species", or <br>
"ecosystem".&gt;<br>
<p>
Hey, I take what Lyle is saying about the kinds of cyberorganisms you <br>
mention very seriously too!<br>
I think we need to consider these existing 'spontaneous orders' whenever we <br>
rev up our dynamic optimism and contemplate boundless expansion through <br>
self transformation.<br>
<p>
A while back, people on the list proposed changing the definition of SO in <br>
BEST DO IT SO to self-ownership.  I recall that some people had complained <br>
that 'Spontaneous Orders' weren't always extropian.  Of course, no one ever <br>
said they were; but, they are there, and they are 'bigger' than us and <br>
can't be ignored.  I hope the new Extropian principle of Self-Ownership <br>
will explicitly address some of these exo-self issues that were sort of <br>
murkily folded into the old Spontaneous Order principle.<br>
<p>
True, Lyle's suggestions are not parodies (Lyle prefers riddles ;)  The <br>
effect is similar though - things are seen out of their usual context and <br>
insights are sometimes obtained.<br>
