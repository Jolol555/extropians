What could a creature "with little or no grey matter" do that a machine <br>
or AI could not do faster and cheaper?  It appears to me that the only <br>
reason to build any tool is to get the job done quicker, cheaper and more <br>
thouroughly than the old tool.  Why assign tasks to a new tool that is <br>
inferior to the one it replaces.  By the time a race of humaniod drones <br>
hit the market, AI should already have a considerable marketshare of <br>
brainless labor. , Machines already out perform humans, horses and oxen <br>
at many brainless tasks, and better machines will(be able) to out perform <br>
them in the remaining drudgeries.<br>
  <br>
A big question is how much will it cost to maintain a drone work force.  <br>
I'm sure that genetic engineers could make more efficient organisms than <br>
those currently available, but they'll still need food and waste <br>
removal.  Who will provide the mindless service of feeding and clean up <br>
after the drones-- machines, humans, or more drones?<br>
<p>
Moral Question: How is bulding an race of drones in a laboratory for <br>
labor different from just building designer humans to perform those same <br>
tasks?  Would these humans be created or enslaved?<br>
