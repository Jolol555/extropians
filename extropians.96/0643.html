                 <br>
<p>
That's true, but I don't think bipedalism can claim credit for our good <br>
endurance, it's because we're much better at getting rid of waste heat than <br>
any other large mammal, and that's  because we have sweat glands on every   <br>
part of our skin, and that's because we don't have a permanent coat of hair. <br>
One of our first inventions must have been the coat, when it's cold we put it <br>
on, when it gets hot we take it off, other animals must ware their coat all <br>
the time. I doubt if Lucy was smart enough to make a coat, so she was probably <br>
very harry and didn't have the endurance of modern humans. Then again, I would <br>
have predicted that she would have a hand much inferior to ours, and I would <br>
have been dead wrong about that, so who knows.<br>

                <br>
<p>
Maybe, but if it means you can see a saber toothed tiger better over the tall  <br>
grass it also means that the saber toothed tiger can see you better too, and  <br>
he's a lot faster and tougher than you are. Anyway apes can walk for short  <br>
distances on 2 legs, long enough to get a good look at things if they want to,  <br>
no need to go to the ridiculous extreme we did. <br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;two free arms to throw rocks with and carry things.                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Maybe, but apes can and do carry things in their arms without becoming  <br>
bipedal like us.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;My guess is that it emerged as we appeared on the east                 </i><br>

<i>                &gt;we originally lived in. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Maybe, but it seems to me that bipedalism would be better in a dense jungle <br>
than an open savanna where speed is all important. On the other hand it <br>
evolved at a time when the climate was getting dryer, the jungle was  <br>
shrinking and the savanna was expanding. Go figure.<br>
                      <br>

<i>                &gt;small but nutrient-rich sources of food. </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
But the hands of modern apes are good enough for that, they do it constantly,  <br>
but that's not what they're best at, they were optimized for locomotion. <br>
Lucy using her delicate hand just to pick up bugs seems like tremendous <br>
overkill to me, but maybe.<br>

                      <br>
<p>
Maybe, but some of aquatic animals have a lot more hair than we do, beavers, <br>
otters, seals.  Being a biped is no advantage in swimming, many mammals are <br>
much  better at it than we are and they never came close to developing <br>
anything like it. It might be a slight advantage in wading, but not much. <br>
It's very difficult to walk in water over a foot deep for any distance,<br>
almost impossible if it's over 2 feet deep, especially if you're only 4 and a <br>
half feet tall as Lucy was. Anyway it's hard to see why a slight advantage in <br>
wading would be important enough to justify such a radical change in body <br>
structure.<br>

<i>                &gt;For throwing?  </i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Maybe, William H Calvin wrote a book about this theory called "The Throwing <br>
Madonna", I found it unconvincing. Following a moving object with your eyes <br>
and then coordinating the muscles in your arm so that you can propel an   <br>
irregular shaped object at it takes split second timing and a lot of brain <br>
power. Even modern humans would have a hard time making a living by throwing<br>
baseballs at running animals, much less irregular rocks, and they have a much  <br>
bigger brain that Lucy did.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt; [ maybe Lucy made ]  Wooden spears or uncut rocks?</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
But a wooden spear would be harder to make than a simple stone tool, and <br>
without bone or stone tools to help you, almost impossible to make. I don't <br>
consider an uncut rock to be a tool, a tool needs to be made, but she may <br>
have used rocks for  something, although I have no idea for what.<br>
