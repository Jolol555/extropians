<i>&gt;I just thought I'd warn you, in case you were thinking of doing such things </i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself.  It's a difficult but exquisite path to follow.  The key to </i><br>
<i>&gt;developing these psychedelic states is to learn to pay close attention to </i><br>
<i>&gt;everything, to develop a very watchful mind, to keep bringing one's</i><br>
attention <br>
<i>&gt;to the present moment.  The benefits are greatly increased intelligence and </i><br>
<i>&gt;learning speed as well as much more detailed and exquisite reality.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;"drawbacks" are the feelings of having the ground perpetually being yanked</i><br>
out <br>
<i>&gt;from under oneself and having to do "sanity checks" fairly often (just to</i><br>
make <br>
<i>&gt;sure).</i><br>
<p>
I have experienced some of what you're talking about relating to the<br>
intricate detail when I was younger. As life went on I dulled it for the<br>
sake of conformity and as my view of imagination vs reality split as I<br>
became older. I need to bring this piece back to me. It's funny how after<br>
elementary, middle, high school, when it's all over you look back and see<br>
all the personality bits and pieces and attempt to lock them all together<br>
and develop them into a firm personality or at least thats the way I see<br>
it. Also what are you talking about in the area of "sanity checks"? I had a<br>
bad panic attack (related to increase in heart rate) the first time I tried<br>
chronic and at the same time had a strange virus that was running through<br>
my family, where you felt very lightheaded---almost empty headed. This<br>
bizarre combination altered my perception in wierd ways for about a week<br>
after I used it. I had to frequently do "sanity checks" and became paranoid<br>
for awhile because strange delusions would come into my head causing me to<br>
act like a hypochrondriac. Some of the symptoms I had were zero short term<br>
memory (forget trying to follow a movie), feeling like I was going to<br>
passout, my entire body going cold, and a terror that I had somehow damaged<br>
my brain and perminantly altered my perception into a paranoid losing touch<br>
with reality when I knew that it was only a little dose of THC. I had tried<br>
weed quite a few times before but that was unlike anything I had ever<br>
experienced before. (Not addicting, I don't have the gene) I don't know<br>
WHAT was going on with the virus in my head. Fortunetly I got over it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also have a difficult time sleeping regular hours and am often up </i><br>
<i>&gt;all night, but that may just be me.</i><br>
<p>
Ahhh, The life of the hacker :) I'm a night person anyways so getting into<br>
computers was only an extension of it.<br>
