<p>
Just to spoil your morning, the uncertainty principle doesn't have<br>
anything to do with atomic nucleus (although the latter suffers<br>
considerably as a result of the former :).  It is a consequence of<br>
the quantum nature of Nature, and would hold in any quantum universe<br>
regardless of the number and strength of (what we nowadays call)<br>
fundamental interactions.  So, assigning an inherent property of<br>
reality to a certain scientific discipline of nuclear physics<br>
strikes me as a particularly yucky way of using the language.<br>
But that's just grumpy ol' me. :)<br>
<p>
To get back to the original thread, the "we're all one big simulation"<br>
argument has been beaten to death.  If true, it's good news for anyone<br>
looking for a Grand Unified Theory because it implies that there is,<br>
in fact, a finite underlying structure of the Universe.  The first<br>
question to ask oneself here is: what difference does it make?<br>
The answer is, of course,_absolutely_none!_ Whether the fabric of<br>
spacetime is a computer or not is totally irrelevant.  What really<br>
matters is whether there are any I/O ports, and how do we recognize<br>
them.  Meditate about _that,_ if you're brave! :)<br>
