<p>
While I appreciate your insistence on real scientific analysis, i think<br>
you are giving to much of a benefit of the doubt to the establishment.<br>
For example, look at the usefulness of colloidal silver as a broad based<br>
antibiotic. It was approved by the FDA prior to the draconian 1934<br>
monopoly enforcing regs, and has a HUGE body of research supporting its<br>
usefulness, even to the point of being more effective  than most current<br>
antibiotics. However, such a substance is not patentable, nor are any of<br>
the methods of manufacturing it patentable. <br>
<p>
As a result, it is not a drug that can be sold at extortionate rates,<br>
but  is priced more like a commodity, i.e. it is relatively cheap.<br>
because of this, you will find NO pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies,<br>
or AMA Doctors willing to sell, produce or prescribe it, because they<br>
would not make anywhere near the same level of excess profit. You can<br>
find it in alternative medical, nutritional, and fitness stores. It does<br>
work to: I have used it on colds flus rashes, etc. with RAPID results. I<br>
wish I could get it up here in the sticks, as I would not have gotten<br>
anywhere near as bad a flu if I had had it handy.<br>
<p>
Also: look at proanthenols as antioxidants (also known as pycnogenol,<br>
and is a class of bioflavinoids). You won't see any doctors or<br>
nutirionists in established hospitals recommending it over Vitamin C,<br>
even though it is known to be over 80 times more effective.<br>
<p>
Doctors are now so up in arms over the effectiveness of melatonin that<br>
because its cutting into their sales of more proprietary drugs for sleep<br>
disorders, they want to have it regulated so that they can charge more<br>
for it.<br>
<p>
Hospitals and doctors need to be prohibited from having any ownership in<br>
pharmacies or pharmaceutical companies, just as media moguls cant have<br>
more than so much media ownership in certain markets. DO this and you'll<br>
greatly decrease the collusion and enhance patient care.<br>
