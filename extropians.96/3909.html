You're right.  It just wouldn't be as convenient or easy.<br>

An absurdly good investment.  Right place, right time...<br>

It used to be a good word.  The university I attended used to have a major<br>
called "cybernetics" under the school of engineering.  Too much use by media<br>
idiots skewed the semantics.<br>

<p>
I checked out the novel.  Pretty righteous!  Just out of curiousity, what<br>
did you do to create it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I suspect my minimum requirements for equipment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are somewhat higher than they need to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I to have been thruu expensive studio setups, and have found out that i</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't really need it anymore. A kebord, a sampler and a computer is all</i><br>
<i>&gt;thats neede. In a wery short time affordable soundcards will take over it</i><br>
<i>&gt;all. (I read once in "Keyboard" magazine that the amount of money spend on</i><br>
<i>&gt;music instruments worldwide was less than whats spend in a big US Mart.)</i><br>
<p>
The one thing I really hate about soundcards (even good ones) is the damn<br>
generic synth sounds they put on those things.  GM is a great idea for<br>
consumer audio, but kind of poor for musical purposes.  I have been kind of<br>
disappointed by the trend towards do-it-all workstations.  They do<br>
everything but are good at nothing.  I'm usually happy with a sampler or two<br>
and maybe an analog synth or a Wavestation.  One thing I did notice is that<br>
no matter how much equipment you have, you usually only really use a couple<br>
items.<br>
<p>
The audio quality on soundcards is getting better, though.  I have a Turtle<br>
Beach soundcard and it puts out an impressively clean signal for a consumer<br>
component.  It is cleaner than many of the synths that I bought 5 years ago.<br>
<p>
I think that soundcards will take over the low end, and may creep into the<br>
mid-range, but I doubt they will impact many people in the mid to high-end<br>
range.  Soundcards are simply too consumer oriented and people who can<br>
afford to spend the money will probably forego the soundcard for a good<br>
dedicated device.  <br>
And not too many studios would want to be wired with 1/8" jacks either. ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Its not what you have, but what you do with what you have.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I know what you mean, but it's not quite right. There's a lot of "buts" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;that remark.</i><br>
<p>
True.  But I know of people who are doing a lot more while having little<br>
than people who have a lot.  If everyone took advantage of what they already<br>
have, then we might need some additional qualifiers.<br>
<p>
And of course, the point is to do something with what you have so that you<br>
can have even more.<br>
