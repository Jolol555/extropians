Sounds interesting.  What if there are many other cases that have not been<br>
publicized?  I could imagine that a number of women did that before, for a<br>
number of reasons: religious, feminist, psychological, or physical.  I assume<br>
most of them wouldn't like to publicize their case.  If there are any, a good<br>
reporter could find one, pay for an interview, and publish it.  Maybe, we can <br>
suggest this idea to some reporters - and then see what happens.<br>
