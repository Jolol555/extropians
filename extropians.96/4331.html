Which will work great for you, if you are in a situation where you can<br>

Good luck ! How i wish you were right, and my 'gut' was wrong...<br>

And we would be all the more vulnerable to those who refuse that same level<br>

into it. Not my idea of an increase of 'freedom'.  <br>

<p>
Sure one should give good reasons to other individuals for doing something,<br>
the difficulty with this is to what extent are you going to share<br>
information with someone who is not going to understand half of that<br>
information, and for who that extra information will distract from the<br>
subject, causing them to forget the essence of what they are, or are not to<br>
do. Simplifying something, i consider almost the same thing as 'lying'. <br>
<p>
If my views appear elitist, it is only because i'm stating facts. One person<br>
will have more problems understanding a particular (your) reason for<br>
something than another, and as i said this does not only have to do with<br>
'intelligence' (however you want to measure that), but also with cultural<br>
differences and peoples world views.     <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;No, and we could not if we tried. What I do suggest it that we 'treat' everyone</i><br>

<p>
Do you think so ? If you explain something to me, in the field of your<br>
expertise, without simplifying ('lying', wether you like it or not) i will<br>
be distracted, confused and probably still completely in the dark about your<br>
reasons, and vice versa. Allthough one might be stimulated to learn some<br>
more about the others expertise, she/he may not have gotten the essence of<br>
the  communication. <br>
