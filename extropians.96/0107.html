<p>
If an entity had no goals at all, then then there would be nothing that it<br>
ought to do. So we must have some basic drives or desires if we are to be<br>
faced with oughts. I think that "oughts" come in because all of us, so long<br>
as we choose to continue living, face the need to make choices and take<br>
actions. If I want to live, then I ought to... eat, drink, seek shelter,<br>
seek to earn a living, and pursue psychological health (else I will kill<br>
myself sooner or later, either deliberately or through self-neglect), and so on.<br>
<p>
Since the universe operates by certain laws, and because their are other<br>
social facts that effect us, at least some values are rational rather than<br>
subjective. I prefer "rational" to "objective" since values are only<br>
objectively required *if* you want to continue living. The existence of<br>
rational values does not mean that we must all have all the same values<br>
since values exist on different levels and many of them are optional. Values<br>
shade into tastes which are generally subjective. I think there are a range<br>
of basic values, principles, and virtues that apply widely to human beings,<br>
but this does not imply a universal total set of values.<br>
<p>
This general outline fits what I take to be the core of Ayn Rand's argument,<br>
though I dislike some of her formulations of it. I think it can be argued<br>
(though I don't claim to do so here) that many extropian values are rational<br>
values, at least in current and probably future conditions. It's arguable<br>
that self-transformation in any radical sense was neither possible nor<br>
desirable in early human history, but I'm certain that it's a rational value<br>
to hold now. This illustrates why "rational" makes more sense than<br>
"intrinsic" -- a value is rational because of how a person can function in<br>
the real world; if the value were intrinsic you would have to value<br>
something regardless of the nature of the world and your relationship to it.<br>
