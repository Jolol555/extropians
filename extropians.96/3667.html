<i>&gt; Since 90% of the people who go into the room see double sixes, it follows</i><br>
<i>&gt; that if you are a person in the room, the chances that you will see double</i><br>
<i>&gt; sixes is 90%, far greater than the 1/36 chance we calculated before.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Let me stick my neck out and state the obvious.<br>
<p>
I think all this means (according to classical probability) is that if<br>
this experiment (an entire sequence of getting people and rolling and gettting<br>
more people until the sixes are rolled being one experiment) is conducted an<br>
infinite number of times, then any person will be in the room at the point the<br>
sixes are rolled in 90% of the experiments.  The underlying reason of course<br>
is that more you have a higher probability of being in a large group than<br>
a small group, a priori.<br>
	This is no contradiction to the 1/36 probability.  Saying that there<br>
is a 1/36 probability of seeing sixes if you are in presently in the room <br>
refers to a different set of experiments, namely gathering a bunch of people in<br>
a room and rolling the dice.  In 1/36 of these (infinitely repeated) <br>
experiments double sixes will be rolled (how many people are in the room is<br>
irrelevant.)  What has happened is we've gained more information.  Before the<br>
experiment starts we don't know which group we're in, but once we actually do<br>
know the probability is 1/36.<br>
