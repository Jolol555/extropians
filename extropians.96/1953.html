Anders, I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I've learned a lot <br>
from both your webpage and your posts here.<br>
I've just started thinking about the genome projects and the near future <br>
results of these researches. And, I'd like to ask your opinion, or <br>
direction, on something.<br>
If gene therapy for humans started at least by 1990, then wouldn't it be <br>
possible to use that technology for genetic re-creation. Example: If I <br>
had the money and the right doctor, could I isolate the "novelty" gene, <br>
whip up an elixir, shot it up (or perhaps inhale it in aerosol form), to <br>
give myself a "high" that made me want to pursue "novel" (or perhaps <br>
there's an extropian gene) ideas, ways and means?<br>
<p>
Anyone?<br>
<p>
Until I hear otherwise I'm going to assume it's possible now, only no <br>
one's doing it.<br>
<p>
David D.<br>
