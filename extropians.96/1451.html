"So consciousness evolved with, and *for*, exchange of experiences and<br>

common representation."<br>
<p>
In the same chapter of Dennett's _Consciousness Explained_ that you<br>
referenced, he makes the point that it is the hardware of the brain that<br>
is parallel, while the mind (in particular the verbal, reasoning part of<br>
the mind) is a *serial* virtual machine running on that hardware: "a<br>
virtual machine is a temporary set of highly *structured regularities*<br>
imposed on the underlying hardware by a program." (My emphasis)<br>
<p>
Dennett even suggests that talking to ourselves ("rehearsal, rehearsal,<br>
rehearsal") is fundamental to how we learn.  I wouldn't disagree, but<br>
would also think that there's an important role for associative<br>
(parallel) thinking as well, especially in synthesis as opposed to<br>
analysis.<br>
<p>
Alexander then asks: "I wonder what kind of consciousness we would<br>
develop if we had a parallel output device - e.g., have the skin surface<br>
work as a hi-res display."<br>
<p>
When we use our whole body (along with all the associated body language<br>
that we've learned), as in dancing, does that qualify as a parallel<br>
output device?<br>
<p>
Actually, there is a wonderful recent story by Amy Thomson, _The Color<br>
of Distance_ (11/95), that explores several forms of parallel<br>
communication in an alien species called the Tendu.  The Tendu have<br>
evolved from amphibians and are generally bipedal creatures.  Their<br>
technology is oriented toward bioengineering rather than the creation of<br>
mechanical artifacts. Their language involves gestures and symbols that<br>
they generate on their chameleon-like skin.  But, their really neat<br>
capability is a form of 'blood-linking' (through wrist spurs) called<br>
'allua'.  They are able (Thomson does not go into mechanisms) to link<br>
with others of their species this way (and other organisms as well) to<br>
share nootropic hormones, perform medical diagnosis and even guide<br>
biotransformations.  I imagine they do this through some type of<br>
nanotech-like, software agents.<br>
<p>
Linda Nagata's 1995 story, _The Bohr Maker_, goes beyond this to<br>
envision people being able to release nanotech agents into the<br>
environment from their pores, or special glands.  The agents then<br>
circulate in the environment, searching for whatever they've been<br>
programmed to look for, and then returning to their host for<br>
'uploading'.  'People' could also communicate using these nanofog<br>
agents.<br>
<p>
But, it's not clear whether complex ideas or data streams could be<br>
exchanged in either of these ways without ultimately passing through a<br>
sequencing routine in the person's mind where relevant information would<br>
be time-stamped, categorized and sorted.  But, it's a good question<br>
whether some type of hypertext-like or 'mind-mapping' approach might<br>
work just as well. I think that an interaction of both parallel routines<br>
and serial routines are probably necessary for the type of experience<br>
that we call consciousness.<br>
