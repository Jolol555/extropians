<i>&gt;&gt; The danger in the snowball and all chain letters is their exponential</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; nature....</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; well-connected people could end up getting dozens of copies without sending</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; out a single one -- no wonder chain letters have such a bad rep!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you object to the viral nature of the information even when the</i><br>
<i>&gt;content is interesting?</i><br>
<p>
If it's _useful_ to most of the people who get it, maybe it's OK.  But<br>
I don't think that things I find _interesting_, or even fun, should be<br>
sent to random people (includes majorly off-topic posts to mailing lists).<br>
Maybe they don't want to play now.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For an ideological life form like a chain letter to survive, it must</i><br>
<i>&gt;have some sort of worthwhile content or it simply will not be copied.</i><br>
<p>
**Snowballs**??!!?  I suppose it's fun (worthwhile?!) for _some_ people,<br>
but if you're going to fire them off, at least use a rifle instead of a<br>
shotgun.  I don't like it when I'm minding my own business and people<br>
having a water fight get me wet, either.  They always apologize, too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I often find that the people who scream about chain letters (because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a line saying "copy me" somewhere in the text) are the same people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who send me junk mail containing the latest net jokes and cute ascii</i><br>
<i>&gt;pictures.</i><br>
<p>
Don't point that finger at _me_!  I don't forward that stuff to lists;<br>
one or two people I know well with whom I regularly exchange such things,<br>
maybe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm curious as to how this 'anti copy me' meme has arisen. Any ideas?</i><br>
<p>
Call it a (possibly vain) attempt to exercise some control over my<br>
informational (as opposed to physical) environment.  And did it ever<br>
occur to you that junk mail might just piss some people off?<br>
There's an element of presumption in a chain letter; it says, in<br>
effect, "I think you are a person who would be interested in this".<br>
I for one dislike having incorrect labels pasted on me.<br>
<p>
I guess I feel that there must be some other people out there who share<br>
my view of chain mail to some extent, or I'd shut up and suffer and<br>
let everybody else have their fun.  But I feel I'm representing the<br>
same sort of "party-poopers" who would rather you didn't hold a slam-dance<br>
party in the apartment upstairs on a work night.<br>
<p>
In the interests of having more people decide to break more chains,<br>
