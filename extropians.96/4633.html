I hereby humbly submit my three suggestions for (hopefully) improving the <br>
signal to noise ratio on this list:<br>
<p>
1. Whenever possible, let's get back to using subject header tags.  My <br>
theory is that using these will force the sender to ask himself how his <br>
message relates to Extropianism before he sends the message, which will, <br>
at best, reduce the number of frivolous postings and at worst give the <br>
reader a heads-up regarding the area of discussion.<br>
<p>
I've provided an example of this (META) in the subject of this message.  <br>
If memory serves me correctly, this indicates  that the message deals <br>
with the workings of the list itself.  A quick perusal of the archives <br>
shows the use of the POL, TECH, BOOK/WEB, and LAW tags.  Perhaps someone <br>
could resurrect a list of commonly accepted and previously used tags and <br>
post them?<br>
<p>
2. Let's make a better effort to rename subject lines as the subject of <br>
the thread changes.  For example, a message posted today entitled "Re: <br>
Meow (was:TWA 800: THE CAT IS OUT!!)" contains a discussion of why there <br>
seems to be a higher percentage of males within the Extropian population <br>
(note to the author - don't feel bad, I just picked this at random).  <br>
Changing the subject to something like "Percentage of female Extropians <br>
(was Re: Meow (was:TWA 800: THE CAT IS OUT!!))", while lengthy, would <br>
give readers who had lost interest in the thread an indication that the <br>
subject had changed.<br>
<p>
3. Think twice before posting "Me too" replies to the list.  Ask yourself <br>
how your message will contribute and add to the body of knowledge <br>
discussed here.  If it's just a commentary on something already said <br>
which will not advance the discussion of the topic, or if it's an <br>
offering of kudos for a job well done, perhaps your message should be <br>
sent to the original author instead of the entire list.<br>
<p>
