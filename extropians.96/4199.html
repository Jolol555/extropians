I understand the theory behind speed reading; that of taking in whole <br>
sentences and paragraphs at a single glance rather than one word at a time.  <br>
But to me, speed reading seems little better than using a copy machine.  Sure, <br>
you've taken in every word in the book, and if you're really good, you can <br>
remember it all, but to me it seems like a very superficial glancing over of <br>
the material rather than delving into it in any meaningful depth.<br>
<p>
I tend to read fairly slowly, basically meditating on the reading material.  I <br>
use the text as a guide, and I follow lots of associations and related <br>
thoughts.  How slow I read depends on how interesting the material is to me.  <br>
I read less interesting stuff faster, since I have little interest in thinking <br>
about the ideas it triggers in me, but I really slow down when something gets <br>
interesting, and I read passages over and over, seeing new meaning every time, <br>
stopping frequently to ponder over the ideas in my mind.  Speed reading would <br>
defeat my entire purpose of reading, because I would just skim over all the <br>
interesting stuff instead of thinking it over carefully.  I've tried to speed <br>
read, and I can go pretty fast, but the faster I go, the more meaningless the <br>
material seems to me.  I'm trying to learn as much as possible when I read; my <br>
main focus is not to get to the end of the book as fast as possible.<br>
<p>
Speed reading is about attractive to me as speed sex -- both are fine if all <br>
you want to do is hurry up and get it over with.<br>
