<i>&gt;I don't see why we need AI at all to reach the singularity!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I make a living designing interfaces, and finding new ways of comunicating.</i><br>
<i>&gt;As far as i can se we don't need AI at all to reach it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It should be possible to do it by simple means of software engineering. As</i><br>
<i>&gt;we make new generations of software they get smarter and smarter. A</i><br>
<i>&gt;wordprocessor today know more about writing, formatting and setting up text</i><br>
<i>&gt;than the simple text editors of yesteryear. The Wordproccesor isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;sentient and it can't create ideas and content. It doesn't have to. [...]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...] It must be designed to be a tool to make tools with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem then will not be to make an AI but to make a simple interface</i><br>
<i>&gt;design. The humans will keep controll and decide the route of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;development. Of course a system design tool like that would probably be</i><br>
<i>&gt;great to use for developing an AI with. :)</i><br>
<p>
I think that last statement is actually a key point.  Any idea you come<br>
up with that will present the issues and choices of tool design better,<br>
will be equally applicable in AI.  User interface is just organizing<br>
information and choices better.  If you do it so well that the user isn't<br>
necessary, then you have AI.  Seriously.<br>
<p>
And just as serious, the humans might fool themselves into thinking they<br>
were still in control.  But how many stories have you read where a servant<br>
lead a master around by filtering information and presenting choices in<br>
a special way?  I just saw an X-Files episode with that theme last night.<br>
Deceit isn't even necessary here, just the kind of point of view that's<br>
encoded in any piece of software.  Think of the mainstream press and<br>
the democratic system as a decision-support system.  To some people it<br>
looks neutral, unbiased and under The People's control, only somehow it<br>
seems to be making a mess of things *and* supporting itself.  Hmm.<br>
<p>
Anyway, what I'm saying is that the real work of AI is the work being done<br>
by more "mundane" programmers: organizing knowledge in better, more<br>
compatible, computer-manipulable ways.  So, much of software development<br>
is leading to AI, or the singularity, whichever comes first, but it's all<br>
the same process.<br>
