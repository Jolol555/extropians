<i>&gt;          primitive mammals and us. </i><br>
 <br>
Right.  My views have changed greatly since that version of the paper.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;First, large-scale engineering such as Dyson spheres and </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;stellar disassembling, might be</i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;effectively impossible, explaining why nearby stars look so </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;          That does not sound extremely unlikely. </i><br>
<p>
How about (from the current paper version):<br>
<i>&gt;For example, colonists might convert some star's asteroids into enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;orbiting solar-energy collectors to collect a substantial fraction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;this star's output, thereby substantially changing the star's</i><br>
<i>&gt;spectral, temporal, and spatial appearances.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          One must be careful, though, not too neglect the possibility </i><br>
<i>&gt;          that new technologies might make a social structure </i><br>
<i>&gt;          incomparably more stable than any we have seen in history; </i><br>
<i>&gt;          and in a certain societies colonisation tendencies would b e </i><br>
<i>&gt;          systematically suppressed.</i><br>
 <br>
The problem with this scenario is that even if only one in a thousand<br>
civilizations don't meet this fate, that still leaves an enourmous<br>
filter to be explained.<br>
         <br>
<i>&gt;          I don't directly disagree with this, but it seems to me that </i><br>
<i>&gt;          you might have slightly too much confidence in the ability </i><br>
<i>&gt;          of the social sciences to tell us what would happen under </i><br>
<i>&gt;          conditions radically different from anything that has </i><br>
<i>&gt;          occurred so far. With &gt;AI and direct access to our </i><br>
<i>&gt;          motivation centres, the psychological mechanisms behind </i><br>
<i>&gt;          sociological phenomena would be totally novel; and we should </i><br>
<i>&gt;          not simply assume that a social theory that appears unlikely </i><br>
<i>&gt;          under present conditions could not be a plausible candidate </i><br>
<i>&gt;          for describing a posthuman society </i><br>
<p>
Of course we must admit there may be things we don't understand.  But<br>
none of these specific considerations you mention seem to point to<br>
anything but the standard conclusion.  As Clark points out, more ways<br>
of varying people just makes the expectation stronger that someone<br>
somewhere will try colonization.  You could have said the same thing<br>
about "the theory of energy conservation" instead of "social<br>
sciences".<br>
