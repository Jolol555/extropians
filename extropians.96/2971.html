<i>&gt;&gt; pressure where they live allows liquid water reactions to continue to occur.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Even then, there is a soft limit somewhere around 150-170 C for most</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; organics.  The absolute hard limit on any planet is somewhere around 375 C</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly for proteins, for aquathermal water is a fierce solute. There </i><br>
<i>&gt;are lots of organic compounds which can survive hefty temperatures, </i><br>
<i>&gt;however. NASA uses polymers capable of withstanding 1500 deg C for short </i><br>
<i>&gt;periods, noticeably lower temps for indefinite time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but these polymers are not in a liquid water environment.  At that<br>
temperature, I believe liquid water would be required to be supercritical.<br>
Supercritical water doesn't just break down organics, it usually oxidizes<br>
them to the greatest extent possible, with the exception of Nitrogen due to<br>
the relatively low temperature.  I've seen supercritical reactors operating<br>
at 550 C that turned ANY organic material into carbon dioxide, water, and<br>
inorganic salts.  It is currently gaining very large favor as a new method<br>
of destroying organic waste, toxic and otherwise.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; since this is where water goes supercritical, although very few organics</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uh oh, this is a seriously bad customer. Whether sand or gold, it </i><br>
<i>&gt;dissolves about anything. Many minerals are of geohydrothermal origin. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Quartz crystals (which are used for computer and clock xtals) are grown </i><br>
<i>&gt;in autoclaves by a hydrothermal process (specifically: a transport </i><br>
<i>&gt;reaction in a temperature gradient).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would survive even to this point (except maybe some halides and a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; proteins).  Cells require a pretty broad spectrum of organic compounds to</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I beg to differ, only the biopolymer stuff. I doubt steroids will notice </i><br>
<i>&gt;much of it. Just remember the hopanes in microfossils.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; operate, and the number of options decreases rapidly as the temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; increases.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;(A toast of deuterium oxide to that).</i><br>
