I want to introduce a new game, called Checkmate (aka hyperchess).    <br>
It is the same as chess, with two exceptions:  <br>
<p>
1.  There is no such thing as a draw or a resignation in Checkmate.  <br>
You always play the game to a conclusion.  Either it ends with a mate, <br>
or it is a null game, in which mate cannot be forced.  A game is not <br>
declared to be null until it is obviously and provably null.  <br>
<p>
2.  The players are teams, consisting of humans and computers <br>
working together.  There can be as many humans as you want -- as <br>
many as you can get to work together without getting in each other's <br>
way.  Coordinating their efforts is part of the challenge of hyperchess.  <br>
A team can either be led by a computer, which makes the moves with <br>
advice from the humans, who are in turn using other computers with <br>
specialized functions; or a team may be led by a human, who plays <br>
with the advice of other humans, all of whom are using computers.   <br>
Another possibility is that a team may not have a leader at all.  It is also <br>
possible to have a minimum team, consisting of an individual human <br>
and one computer -- with either the human or the computer acting as <br>
lead player.  <br>
<p>
In other words:  your task, as a player of hyperchess, is to design and <br>
build a SuperIntelligence.  How you do it is up to you.   <br>
<p>
I hereby issue a challenge to the Extropians:  two years years from now, <br>
in September of 1988, the first annual Checkmate tournament will take <br>
place.   Be there or be square.  <br>
<p>
The interesting thing about this is that to play hyperchess, you have to <br>
design a SuperIntelligence.  In other words, you have to design a mind.  <br>
How do you do that?  This is a philosophical problem -- or a problem in <br>
philosophical engineering.  You (the Extropian team) can use Ayn <br>
Rand's metaphysics, Ian Goddard's logic, Max More's philosophy of <br>
mind, Marvin Minsky's insights into AI, Tim Freeman's expertise in <br>
computer science, and so forth, to design a SuperIntelligence.  There are <br>
many people on the list who could make theoretical contributions, and <br>
many programmers who can write the code that will have to be written.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile I will also be designing a SuperIntelligence, using my <br>
metaphysics, my logic, and so forth, and recruiting a team to help me <br>
write the code and play the game.  <br>
<p>
I am going to extend this challenge to other memes as well.  This fall <br>
I am going to be travelling to various college campuses.  My main <br>
purpose is to recruit students for my own projects, but I will also <br>
attend meetings of on-campus Christian organizations, and invite them <br>
to enter a team in the hyperchess tournament.  They can design a <br>
SuperIntelligence based on their metaphysics (monotheist), their logic <br>
(Thomist), their philosophy of mind, and so forth, and they can use <br>
Christian chessplayers to play the game and Christian programmers to <br>
write the code.  (Yes, Christian programmers do exist.)  The  idea of a <br>
SuperIntelligence is not new to them -- according to the Bible, the <br>
church itself is a kind of SuperIntelligence, with Christ as the head and <br>
the church as the body.  The idea of competition is not new to them, <br>
either;  way back in the Roman Empire, they set out to be superior to <br>
the heathens in every way -- intellectual, spiritual, social, whatever.  <br>
<p>
There are various other memes that might want to enter teams.  <br>
IBM can enter Big Blue, assisted by human players.  That is the level <br>
on which the game will be played.  Surely the Extropian world-meme <br>
can compete on this level... ?    <br>
<p>
SuperIntelligences have existed for a long time.  Corporations are <br>
SuperIntelligences; so are armies, so are nation-states, so are churches.  <br>
The only new factor is that now SuperIntelligences can make use of <br>
computers, but this doesn't change the situation in any essential way.  <br>
<p>
May the best SI win.  May the best philosophy win.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
