<i>&gt;1 thread is about the TWA 800, aka a conspiracy discussion.</i><br>
1 thread is about the existence of god, aka a basic existensialist question<br>
(at leat part of the thread)<br>
1 thread is about worker/emplyer relationsship, aka govermental influence<br>
<p>
<p>
You are quite right! The usual threads have seemed to be drowned out by these<br>
3 - good observation. <br>
TWA_ THE CAT IS OUT!! arrives in my mailbox  at least ten times a day...<br>
<p>
Most of the time the discussion is on advanced<br>
technology, (and ethical concerns about ), cryonics, communications, AI,<br>
immortality, philosophy, space, <br>
abundance( or lack of) and resource development, neuro biology, futurist arts<br>
and etc....<br>
  I have learned much from some<br>
of the brilliant minds that are here and the resources <br>
found here from time to time.<br>
<p>
 Then there are "topics" that refuse to die.<br>
Even though to me they seem like either<br>
conundrums, or at best old battles rehashed....<br>
I think maybe a few people feel *very* strongly about<br>
them.<br>
<p>
Many of us delete them in the e-box, and check <br>
every now and then to see if the thread may have mutated.<br>
