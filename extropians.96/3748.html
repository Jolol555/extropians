<i>&gt;Beyond The Beyond...</i><br>
<i>&gt;---------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   This is the deal.  I've recently been getting into three-dimensional,</i><br>
<i>&gt;interactive virtual world building, and am currently teaching myself how to</i><br>
<i>&gt;combine VRML 2.0 and Java to that end.  I was wondering if their are any</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanist/extropian thinkers/visionaries/artists out their who  would</i><br>
<i>&gt;like to help design a transhumanist virtual space, similar to the BeyondMOO</i><br>
<i>&gt;at lucifer.com but in interactive, textured 3D (using VRML 2.0 with </i><br>
<i>&gt;behaviours, Java scripting,etc).  I'm looking at this to be a fairly</i><br>
<i>&gt;long-term process, but one I believe should be start as early as possible.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[much snipping...]</i><br>
<p>
I think this is a *great* idea.  This is would be *very cool*!<br>
<p>
I would be very much willing to get actively involved, since much of this<br>
technology is right up my alley anyway.  I am sure my skills will be useful<br>
in setting this up.<br>
<p>
Here is what I can offer to the project:<br>
<p>
-Java development experience.  I have significant experience developing Java<br>
applications, both server-side and client-side.<br>
<p>
-Data/Database integration and client/server back-ends.  This will be very<br>
critical for a project of this magnitude.  This is the part of content-heavy<br>
sites that no one sees, but is directly responsible for much of the dynamic<br>
nature of sites.  These types of technologies will also be necessary for a<br>
solid and powerful multi-user environment.  This is an area of personal<br>
expertise.  I have personally developed (and license) several cutting edge<br>
technologies and techniques in this area to some of the largest software<br>
companies.  I would be more than happy to donate my techniques and knowledge<br>
to this project.<br>
<p>
-Anything Internet related.  I have done more work and development on TCP/IP<br>
related software and technologies than I care to remember.<br>
<p>
-Project management skills.  I have experience managing and coordinating<br>
large, distributed projects of this nature.  If you would like, I can help<br>
coordinate the efforts.<br>
<p>
There is also a significant probability that I could get a dedicated server<br>
and dedicated T-1 range bandwidth for the project when it is ready to go<br>
online for final release, but I can't guarantee this one at this point in time.<br>
<p>
If nothing else, I think this would be fun (and educational!) project for us<br>
to embark on.  <br>
<p>
