If something could create the entire Earth and two humans, I think it<br>
might be able to keep recessives from mixing until the pool was big<br>
enough.  Or even easier, and more plausible, it could create Adam and<br>
Eve without any harmful recessives in the first place, the ones we have<br>
being accumulated mutations.  Or injected punishment for the Fall.<br>

And hey, one proffered explanation for aging has been that it results<br>
from genes which are good during the usual reproduction window and have<br>
nasty side effects later.  So if the Adamic humans had a better genome<br>
this would explain both harmless incest and 900+ year lifespans[1].<br>

Better do better than that, "CiXeL".<br>

a woman, even if she is named.  But Cain has important children and all,<br>
but he doesn't seem to die.<br>

[2]Perhaps that part of the Bible is an arithmetic primer.  "Lamech<br>

Lamech when he died?"<br>
