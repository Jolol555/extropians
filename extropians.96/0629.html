I don't think the key step was making the first tool, it was making the first <br>
hand that could make the first tool, and I don't think brain growth was <br>
steady, it took an enormous spurt as soon as that first hand came into <br>
existence. Three and a half million years ago Australopithecus Afarensis  <br>
(Lucy) had a hand almost as good as ours but her brain was small, it ranged  <br>
from 380 to 450 cc. That's not much better than a modern chimpanzee which has <br>
a range of 300 to 400 cc. In just 3 million years Lucy's children increased <br>
their brain size to the level of modern humans with a range of 1000 to over <br>
2000 cc.<br>
<p>
A lot of the mystery about Human evolution could be cleared up if we could <br>
answer 2 questions:<br>
 <br>
1) Why did bipedalism develop? It's very hard to do, makes us slow, and <br>
   causes us back problems. <br>
            <br>
2) Why did Lucy have a hand capable of moving things with precision when it <br>
   doesn't look like she had a brain good enough to take advantage of it?  <br>
   The first very primitive tools appeared over a million years after Lucy's  <br>
   kind first came on the sense and were made by a more advanced species,  <br>
   Homo Erectus. If not making tools Lucy must have been doing something with  <br>
   that hand that greatly enhanced her survival. She didn't have much else  <br>
   going for her, she was small, weak, slow and had puny teeth and claws, yet   <br>
   for some reason she thrived.<br>
