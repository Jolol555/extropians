Hi<br>
<p>
I recently joined your newsgroup and this is my first posting.  Hope I've<br>
done it correctly.<br>
<p>
I was sent this by eMail about ten days ago from a friend in LA.  It makes<br>
interesting reading.<br>

 TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE<br>
I received the following information via fax.  The source is a<br>
747 Captain, but I cannot say anymore.  His sources are reportedly reliable<br>
with inside information.  He has transmitted the information already to ABC<br>
News. If this story is true (and the pieces do seem to fit), there is<br>
obviously a very tight cover-up in progress which would include our<br>
Commander in Chief....  Here is the story as it came across my fax:<br>
<p>
"TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE fired from a<br>
guided missile ship which was in area W-105 about 30 miles from where TWA<br>
flight 800 exploded.  W-105 is a Warning Area off the southeast cost of<br>
Island and is used by the military for military operations including<br>
missile firing.  It is believed that, while W-105 is a rather large area,<br>
budget constraints have dictated that missile firings be done closer to<br>
land so that the flight time for the P-3 monitor and tracking aircraft  can<br>
be reduced.<br>
<p>
Guided missile ships conduct practice firings on a regular basis and Navy<br>
P-3 radar planes track and evaluate the missile shots with their onboard<br>
instrumentation.  A P-3 aircraft was on a southwest heading about over the<br>
top of TWA 800.  There was a US Air Flight coming from the Southeast<br>
descending towards Providence, RI that had been cleared to 21,000 feet and<br>
Air Traffic Control (ATC) had determined that there would be a conflict. As<br>
a result of the traffic conflict, the TWA flight was restricted to 13,000<br>
feet.  ATC then requested the US Air flight to to turn on his landing<br>
lights.  If TWA could see his lights and identify him visually, the<br>
controller could safely clear the TWA flight to continue his climb  The P-3<br>
was SKIN PAINT or a non-beacon target.  (This means that his transponder<br>
was turned OFF.<br>
<p>
Transponders reply to ATC radar and show a well defined radar target on the<br>
controller's scope, complete with ID and altitude.  All civilian aircraft<br>
and airliners are required to fly with them when in controlled airspace.  A<br>
skin paint target probably would not even be visible to the controller.)<br>
The P-3 made NO calls to ATC.  After the explosion, he continued his flight<br>
to the west and then called ATC and asked if they would like him to turn<br>
around and assist with the "accident".<br>
<p>
 You will remember that the first announcement about this accident came<br>
from the Pentagon.  The spokesman mentioned that they were sending the Navy<br>
to the crash site.  They immediately sent a Navy Captain, who was replaced<br>
the very next day by a one star Admiral from Norfolk. That admiral is still<br>
on the scene as of 8-23-96.  At least 5 Aegis destroyers are based in<br>
Norfolk. The FBI has conducted about 3,000 eye witness interviews and the<br>
NTSB has not been able to be a part of these interviews nor have they any<br>
access to the contents of them.<br>
<p>
Some of those eyewitnesses reported seeing lights. Those were probably the<br>
landing lights of the US Air plane. The NTSB is there in name ONLY.  All<br>
announcement made by Mr.Bob Francis say absolutely nothing and notice that<br>
the FBI is always standing beside or behind Mr Francis and it would appear<br>
that his job is to make sure that nothing is said that would give away "THE<br>
BIG SECRET!" Here is a list of the Aegis Destroyers based at<br>
Norfolk.....could one of them be the one which fired the fatal shot?  USS<br>
Ramage, USS Arligh Burke (DDG 51), USS Barry (DDG 52), USS Stout (DDG 55),<br>
USS Mitscher  (DDG 57) and USS Laboon (DDG 58).  USS Ramage has a crew of<br>
22 officers and 315 enlisted personnel." That is the gist of the<br>
story......  again he and his source wish to remain annonymous.<br>
<p>
Questions arise...... how could they keep it quiet this long. Certainly<br>
people in the P-3 and the Destroyer would talk?  Why keep it quiet when it<br>
is bound to come out, and can't be covered for ever? But, remember that<br>
this is an election year.  The Navy has had a very tough time in recent<br>
years and is very sensitive to its reputation.  The administration has<br>
dealt very harshly with it.  Generals and Admirals have been fired with<br>
little notice. Sources which are very, very familiar with the 747 report<br>
that a mechanical cause is almost impossible, especially since the data and<br>
voice recorders give no information.  A mechanical or structural failure<br>
would have given some warning to the pilots if only a few seconds.  The<br>
primary cause had to be a large explosion.<br>
<p>
The chemical traces found which are consistant with a bomb are also<br>
consistant with the explosive compounds used in military missiles. Aegis<br>
missiles, unlike Stinger missiles and those likely to be used by a<br>
terrorist, are not heat seekers.  Thus, the recovery of intact engines do<br>
not explain away an Aegis missile hit.  The airplane would not be<br>
pressurised (at least not very much) at that low altitude.  Therefore, a<br>
small bomb in the cabin would likely not have such immediate catastrophic<br>
effect.  Large cargo hold bombs have all but been ruled out. The pieces<br>
fit..... all except the reasons for the cover up.<br>
<p>
Time will tell..............<br>

I showed the information to a friend in England who is an ex USAF fighter<br>
pilot, only 40 so he's reasonably current.  This was his take:<br>
<p>
<p>
1.  Is one to presume that ABC have been warned off divulving *any* info?<br>
<p>
2.  He questions the assumption that a small bomb in the cabin would likely<br>
not have had such immediate effect, stating that fuel-load and impact point<br>
of the missile would have had a major bearing.<br>
<p>
3.  Was the planned IFF system not developed/implemented within the Aegis<br>
Weapons System for the designator (P3) to activate?  If it was, a weapons<br>
system fault occurred.  If not, grave human error - DDG *must* activate<br>
prior to missile release.<br>
<p>
4.  Why did the P3 not seek ID of TWA 800 directly?  It could still have<br>
remained skin paint to ATC<br>
<p>

This reply came back from Ron at Trillium, the original source:<br>
<p>
<p>
Your Aegis story has been extremely well received.<br>
Unfortunately that means most people I have passed it along<br>
too are conspiracy theorists.  Hasan says he has always suspected<br>
such, however, cites humanistic tendencies of sailors as a reason<br>
for Navy silence not being plausible.  I would cite the possible<br>
monetary rewards from tabloid journals.  Rick Collins, himself a<br>
former pilot has also believed it was a missile. He cites fellow<br>
pilots' observation and an apparent picture which a couple<br>
had taken at a function at waters edge which contained an object<br>
heading skyward with a firey plume.  Apparently the picture received<br>
cursory mention on some news programs and the FBI has the originals.<br>
Nanci is intrigued by the story and will talk it up in Russia to see<br>
if there is any affirmation from intelligence circles.<br>

Peter, Richard, the following is<br>
additional commentary from people<br>
in my office concerning the<br>
TWA-missile theory....<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; From dina@trillium.com Mon Sep  9 14:26 PDT 1996</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's say the military budget is reduced (we all know it is),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and this translates into testing in a smaller range.  Why</i><br>
<i>&gt; would the space chosen be closer to land, and closer to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; airspace of our busiest national and international airport, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; other airports as well (you mentioned Provedence RI).</i><br>
<p>
Without discounting any of the questions you have raised (which I think<br>
are valid), let me add a data point to this discussion. About a week<br>
ago, I read in the L.A.Times that the captain of a commercial airplane<br>
reported seeing a missile fly by his plane, somewhere in the Carolinas.<br>
This was a missile testing area as well. I was quite taken aback to read<br>
this since I would imagine that such testing would occur well out of the<br>
way of commercial air traffic. But since it happened, I am less<br>
surprised by the story that Nishi sent out.  In fact, in the same new<br>
article, it was mentioned that questions were raised about the<br>
possibility of a test missile having hit the TWA plane, but officials<br>
denied that there were any test missiles involved in the crash.<br>
