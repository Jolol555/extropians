<i>&gt;In his 12/96 Wired article ... Brin says that it is</i><br>

<i>&gt;they are so watched, whether there are cameras in police stations, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether cameras are banned from many indoor places.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The obvious question is: why are these the choices?  Why is the one</i><br>

<p>
Sorry to be opaque, let me elaborate.  Your basic argument appears to<br>
be that it is inevitable that "they" will be able to watch "us", but<br>
that we may be able now to choose whether we watch them.  Given your<br>
assumptions, your anti-privacy answer is obvious -- of course, let us<br>
watch them.  But what if you are dead wrong about your assumptions?<br>
If it were inevitable that we could not watch them, but open to choice<br>
whether they could watch us, the obvious choice would be pro-privacy<br>
-- let them not watch us.<br>
<p>
Given that your assumptions about what is and isn't likely to be up<br>
for grabs matter this much, you need to give explicit arguments to<br>
defend these assumptions.  I'm not saying you're wrong - just undefended.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Robin, I do not insist that these are the only choices.  I maintain only</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the mighty have a window of opportunity in which they MAY be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;set up barriers against light.  Barriers that you and I cannot hope to</i><br>
<i>&gt;match, no matter how many PGP programs the cypherpunks tout.  WE will live</i><br>
<i>&gt;in glass houses, like it or not.  </i><br>
<p>
I will join your crusade, *if* you can convince me that you have<br>
correctly identified here what is open to change here and what is not.<br>
