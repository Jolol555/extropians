When I was an enthusiastic 18 year old, newly come to this list and<br>
Vinge, I reverently kept my mouth shut.  Admittedly the list may have<br>
been more inspiring then, but I didn't become a regular poster for a<br>
couple of years.  Having little to say, I knew enough to not say it.<br>
<p>
It occurs to me that one of the things being discussed then was recipes,<br>
largely in connection to calorie restriction I suppose. I first heard of<br>
lactose intolerance in that discussion.  While I didn't think it was<br>
that inspiring, it was actually more practical than most other threads,<br>
now or then.  And it illustrates a point *against* topical lists: there<br>
already are newsgroups and mailing lists to discuss many extropian<br>
topics separately.  I could go try to follow cryonics and cryptography<br>
and space tech and quantum tech and libertarian politics and frugal<br>
living and cal-res diets and ... in a whole bunch of separate places.  I<br>
don't have the time.  It's nice to have one place where (1) there are a<br>
bunch of people who share a similar spectrum of interests and (2) topics<br>
can *cycle* among the various possibilities, so over time you visit<br>
everything, hear the news worth hearing, without drowning yourself.<br>
<p>
I have a megabyte of unread extropians and cypherpunks mail from 3 years<br>
ago (this was the L. Detweiler meets Medusa phase of the latter) and am<br>
looking at the subjects of the posts, figuring this won't really violate<br>
the closed list policy.<br>
<p>
Something inspired by the Polly Klaas shooting on how to balance the<br>
effects of a Singularity so that more people don't go beserk from<br>
distruption as we approach it.<br>
Something on the Hubble telescope and its relationship to spy<br>
satellites.<br>
"I highly recommend Mosaic."<br>
Proof that AltInst already existed, which I didn't realize.  <br>
Why aren't there more women on the list?<br>
The possibility of early retirement.  Very early.<br>
When one first used a computer.<br>
Will Cryptoanarchy keep us safe?<br>
NMR microscopy.<br>
The decline and fall of the extropians list.<br>
Future neologisms (detweil)<br>
Will Jupiter Brains consider us lunch?<br>
Copyrights under cryptoanarchy.<br>
Iceland's saga-era legal system.  (Guess who wrote that post.)<br>
Steganography.<br>
<p>
Virtual Seminars on stuff, such as startups.<br>
<p>
I miss "the squirrel."  And many other names from then.<br>
<p>
I also didn't see any cypherpunks mail.  That much extropians and<br>
altinst stuff?  Wow.  I also didn't realize I'd been subscribed to<br>
AltInst then.<br>
<p>
I second John Blanco-Losada's call for subject headers.<br>
META, PHIL, POLI, SCI, TECH, HUMOR, FRIV(olous), JUNK, NOISE.  SPACE,<br>
CRYO, BIO, LIT.<br>
<p>
I notice that in the Golden Age, we didn't use abbreviations, or at<br>
least more rarely.  POLITICS.  CRYONICS.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>

Do not look upon this glass,<br>
Lest your soul from this world pass<br>
This legend burned upon its case<br>
You dare not see the mirror's face.<br>
