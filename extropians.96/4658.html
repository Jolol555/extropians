<i>&gt;&gt;In an uploaded realm, the only method is blanket socialism which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;must be programmed in before we enter the uploaded realm. It's a different</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;world. Capitalism will destroy the system. Also socialism could work in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;uploaded realm and you could have intelligent agents designing and creating</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;newer better faster processors and increasing the processing speed and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;being the engineer side while we kick back and relax and be the artistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;creative side.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I can agree to being one brain cell in a brain composed of many but not all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;brain cell/people being merged into one cell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Need I say more?</i><br>

I am not a socialist. Socialism doesn't work in our material world. But in<br>
the uploaded realm it just might. Everything is SO EXTREME and simplified<br>
in the uploaded realm and not fuzzy like the real world that capitalism may<br>
not be able to hold it's own. I'm only saying it's something to experiment<br>
with when we get there. I myself want to be an individual living in an<br>
uploaded realm, not have my best parts blended into a supreme individual<br>
and losing my stream of consciousness.<br>
