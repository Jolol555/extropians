Here's a forwarded post from the gentec mailing list.  This is<br>
interesting in the context of "Media Attacks" and transhumanist ideas. <br>
I can't help but wonder what kind of "guerilla tactics" will be employed<br>
in the years ahead, as (trans)humans begin more overt bio-engineering.<br>

     GREENPEACE STOPS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SOYBEAN DESTINED FOR<br>
     EUROPE ON MISSISSIPPI RIVER<br>
<p>
     MISSISSIPPI RIVER, LOUISIANNA, NOVEMBER 19TH 1996<br>
<p>
     Today , the Greenpeace ship 'MV Greenpeace' sailed up the<br>
     Mississippi River to confront food industry giant Cargill at their<br>
     grain facility in Laplace , 60 miles outside of New Orleans.<br>
     Activists in inflatable boats identified a ship being loaded with<br>
     Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans and "branded" the ship<br>
     with bright yellow posters tha t read 'X - Genetic Experiment'.<br>
     Meanwhile six other activists climbed onto the grain facility,<br>
     preventing the loading of the genetically engineered soybeans.<br>
<p>
     "Consumers are refusing to buy genetically altered soybeans<br>
     because of the risks to their health and the environment. By<br>
     refusing to keep separate the genetically altered soybeans,<br>
     companies like Ca rgill are putting U.S. markets at risk," said<br>
     Greenpeace International spokesperson Michelle Sheather onboard<br>
     the MV Greenpeace.<br>
<p>
     Soybeans are the United States' second largest agricultural<br>
     export, with approximately 40% of the crop exported to Europe.<br>
     Over one hundred European retailers, food manufacturers, and food<br>
     processor s have refused to accept Monsanto's genetically<br>
     engineered soybeans due to concerns of health hazards and<br>
     environmental safety. Monsanto is the chemical company responsible<br>
     for the creation of the g enetically altered soybean. Cargill is<br>
     one the main companies responsible for the export of the<br>
     genetically engineered soybeans.<br>
<p>
     Last week in Louisiana, Greenpeace and representatives from the<br>
     National Family Farm Coalition and National Family Farm Defenders<br>
     came together to protest at a Monsanto facility on the Mississippi<br>
     ri ver and jointly demanded that Monsanto take the genetically<br>
     altered soybeans off the market. Also last week, Greenpeace<br>
     activists blockaded the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) grain<br>
     facility in Destreh an, Louisiana and called for the grain<br>
     facility to ensure separation of the genetically altered soybeans<br>
     from natural soybeans. On Friday, ADM lawyers served Greenpeace<br>
     with notice of a court injunc tion and a restraining order that<br>
     would prohibit any further protests at ADM facilities.<br>
<p>
     Last week in Europe, Greenpeace blockaded shipments of soybeans<br>
     being imported by Cargill as they arrived into Antwerp and Ghent<br>
     in Belgium. The protests were both ended following court<br>
     injunctions f ining Greenpeace 30 000 dollar for every hour that<br>
     the protests continued. Over the weekend Greenpeace activists<br>
     painted 'No X-soya' on both sides of another Cargill vessel, just<br>
     before she entered B elgium waters. The Greenpeace ship the Sirius<br>
     has been impounded in Belgium since last Thursday.<br>
<p>
     Greenpeace has complied with all of the court orders but said its<br>
     campaign would continue. Greenpeace believes genetically<br>
     engineered organisms pose a serious risk to the environment, human<br>
     health and the future health of the U.S farm economy.<br>
<p>
<p>
     GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS RELEASED FROM JAIL<br>
<p>
     NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANNA, NOVEMBER 20TH 1996<br>
<p>
     Five Greenpeace activists arrested yesterday at the Cargill grain<br>
     terminal for protesting the companies export of genetically<br>
     engineered soybeans were released today. The activists (Peter<br>
     Bradley, Anibal Rivera, Monica Rhode, David DeRosa, Tanya<br>
     Whitford) have been charged with criminal trespass and were held<br>
     over night at St. John the Baptist Parish and were released with<br>
     $3,000 bond.<br>
<p>
     In the past week Greenpeace has escalated its campaign against the<br>
     new genetically engineered soybean created by chemical giant<br>
     Monsanto and exported by grain companies Cargill, ADM and others.<br>
<p>
     Last week in Louisiana, Greenpeace and representatives from the<br>
     National Family Farm Coalition and National Family Farm Defenders<br>
     came together to protest at a Monsanto facility on the Mississippi<br>
     river and jointly demanded that Monsanto take the genetically<br>
     altered soybeans off the market. Also last week, Greenpeace<br>
     activists blockaded the Acher Daniels Midland (ADM) grain facility<br>
     in Destrehan, Louisiana and called for the grain facility to<br>
     ensure separation of the genetically altered soybeans from natural<br>
     soybeans. On Friday, ADM lawyers served Greenpeace with notice of<br>
     a court injunction and a restraining order that would prohibit any<br>
     further protests at ADM facilities.<br>
<p>
     On Thursday the European Parliament voted to call for the<br>
     segregation of the genetically engineered soybeans from the normal<br>
     soybeans. Cargill has refused to separate the soybeans sparking<br>
     protests in Europe and the United States. Greenpeace believes<br>
     genetically engineered organisms pose a serious risk to the<br>
     environment, human health and the future of the U.S. farm economy.<br>
     Greenpeace vowed today to continue its international campaign<br>
     against genetically engineered soybeans<br>
