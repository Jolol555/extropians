<i>&gt;That quote from Bertrand Russell is so startling and powerful because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes from a mathematical genius, someone who knew as much about logic</i><br>
<i>&gt;as anyone in human history, and yet had a rather difficult time</i><br>
<i>&gt;harnessing the emotions in his own personal life. (This from a Wall St.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Journal review of a Russell biography that I saw within the last few</i><br>
<i>&gt;months.)</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps there are two extremes dealing with ways people deal with emotions<br>
because logic creates maturity. I know people of both extremes which are<br>
very intelligent and logical  in their jobs or when analyzing but have<br>
little control over emotional outbursts in their social life and i know<br>
people who are very mature in their social life with great control over<br>
their emotions (they can take alot of shit) and have average intelligence.<br>
