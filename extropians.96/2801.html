<p>
I suggest the following scale:<br>
<p>
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...... rude and deceitful<br>
STATE GOVERNMENT........ lazy and slow to respond<br>
LOCAL GOVERNMENT........ bureaucratic, polite, and mildly responsive if you<br>
don't ask too much<br>
<p>
Of course, you may occasionally run into someone new and idealistic.<br>
<p>
Regarding the post office, what you are really saying is that if you only<br>
request routine services, but act all the while as if they are performing<br>
valorous deeds, they will respond positively -- in customary slow motion.<br>
<p>
In general, employees of local government know they must be more courteous<br>
because their jobs are rarely guaranteed for life, they must often deal<br>
with the same people repeatedly, and they know there could be future<br>
ramifications (e.g., they may discover the victim of their rudeness is, or<br>
becomes, a person of authority).<br>
<p>
I think Michael was trying to illustrate that government employees are much<br>
less responsive than company (i.e., free market) employees.  Lack of<br>
friendliness is not the real issue, however, but merely a symptom.<br>
Personally, I avoid State and Federal employees as much as possible.  When<br>
forced to deal with them -- usually because no alternative is *permitted*<br>
-- I would much prefer they scowl at me while doing as I request in a<br>
prompt and competent manner.<br>
<p>
Of course, some of them have discovered a friendly countenance is<br>
sufficient to win effusive praise from Statists.<br>
