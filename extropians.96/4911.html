I think the canonical example is Islam. Note that it didn't *force*<br>
anybody to join the religion, its proponents just took power, removed<br>
parts or the whole of the old leadership, and ruled without outlawing<br>
other religions. But there is a definite "trickle-down effect" of the<br>
religion of the rulers, both due to (I assume) a wish to be more like them<br>
and get closer to them, and their actions which promote their own<br>
religion (for example by building splendid mosques). After a while you <br>
have a leading class of converts, and the religion will spread further. <br>
As society becomes more and more dominated by one religion, its memes <br>
will have a better chance to convert most people (except for the die-hards).<br>
<p>
It should be noted that conquest tends to be traumatic for the conquered<br>
people (how is that for an understatement?), so they might be more likely<br>
to convert simply because they feel they will get better protection and<br>
stability, and besides their old religion didn't help much. A Stockholm<br>
syndrome on a national scale? Interesting... that might suggest why <br>
forced conversions sometimes work too.<br>
<p>
But I wonder how many religions have been spread this way? Christianity,<br>
yes. Islam, yes. Judaism used a bit of local genocide when arriving from<br>
Egypt and then tried to spread mainly by lineage, not by converting<br>
people. Hinduism? I don't know, it seems too diffuse to be usefully<br>
spread. Buddhism? Not as far as I know. Polytheism has never spread well,<br>
except for the destruction/symbolic defeat of the god of the defeated<br>
(think of Set). <br>
