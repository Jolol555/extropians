LYLE<br>
<i>&gt;But even the good ideas are </i><br>
just yakking, in the sense that they are forgotten after a few weeks.  <br>
Everything on the list disappears into a void.  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I usually dont comment on list noise, since <br>
diuscussing  it IS list<br>
noise, IMHO.<br>
But Lyle has a good.point.<br>
<p>
The list is not a total YAK factory,  DOES provide references for thoughtful<br>
things:<br>
 (Like the URLs on digitial imaging and science factoids<br>
from Eugene, Cryonics updates, techofetish fwds, <br>
Natasha's art quotes- and Anders' diversity  is<br>
really quite asounding! And of course everyone has <br>
their own brand of personality and knowledge-although<br>
he is brilliant too, sometimes John Clark makes me<br>
laugh out loud!)<br>
<p>
But a lot of it is really just as Lyle said,a cycle, with <br>
new people, who dont read about transhumanism, or<br>
even visit Extropy webpage, or read the back issues<br>
or FAQs-  asking "What's Dynamic Optimism? Are you Extropians really into<br>
this cryonics?? <br>
hey, WHO IS this FM2030 ; -)?<br>
<p>
Is this worthwile time spent? Patiently....<br>
Or is time better spent working? Researching? Building and creating? Having<br>
FUN?<br>
<p>
Lyle is right!... how can you filter? <br>
Some names I know are noise 99%. <br>
But some people consider me 'noise' too, I am sure.<br>
Some of the "chatter" is very useful to me, some of <br>
LYLE'S chatter even. It is good to have the diversity <br>
-like the impossible Singularity theory.<br>
But then, one man YAK is another man's theorem...<br>
