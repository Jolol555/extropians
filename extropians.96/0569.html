 Why not write Wade Cherrington yourself and ask?  Max is no<br>
 "central extropian authority".  If you can convince Wade with<br>
 the authority of your own argument, I'm sure he'll post.<br>

<p>
Humm......<br>
I think that  Max will have his own ideas on this, but to me, since Max<br>
publishes the "Extropy" magazine, and spends an awful lot of time and energy<br>
doing PR and writing articles and interviews and organizes the EXTRO<br>
conferences -<br>
he looks pretty Central to me. <br>
He looks pretty Extropian too!<br>
                       Authority, well - I hate that word! Question<br>
Authority! -- and authoratively- he (continuously and contextually)will have<br>
to 'show and prove'  -  but til someone else puts that much energy and<br>
visibility into promoting Extropy, i am content to think of him as a pretty<br>
damn good contact and source.<br>
<p>
PS<br>
It may be none of my business, and I dont know if it was your intent, but in<br>
light of all the unfair slander and abuse Max has taken lately ( in my<br>
opinion from people who are jealous or massively uninformed) this could be<br>
read as yet another,  not so nice, not very well veiled - jab.<br>
