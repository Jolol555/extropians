Thanks for clarifying your reply. As I understand it now, your view turns out<br>
to be similar to that of another reply (sorry I didn't keep a copy and forget<br>
who it was) that, in effect, one's desire for privacy of certain aspects of<br>
one's life is nothing more than an arbitrary 'taste' which I have no business<br>
questioning or passing judgement on.<br>
<p>
     However, I reject this view of a person's desire for privacy. I strongly<br>
believe that a deep concern for privacy is psychologically unhealthy. To the<br>
extent that someone has this need, they are to that extent psychologically<br>
crippled and certainly less estimable in my judgement than someone who has no<br>
need for personal privacy.<br>
<p>
     It is reasonable that someone does not wish to openly show certain aspects<br>
of ones life if one will be physically bothered by others because of it (as<br>
someone pointed out), however, I still believe that it is a fair question to<br>
ask "Why are you bothered by someone seeing you engaged in what are 'normally'<br>
considered private functions, if that person does absolutely nothing physical<br>
to bother you". My view is that you have no rational basis for being concerned<br>
with the thoughts of another, however, lecherous or otherwise evil, so long as<br>
those thoughts do not result in any physical (and I include verbal with<br>
physical) response.<br>
<p>
     Furthermore, I think some aspects of the desire for privacy are ass-<br>
backwards and should be turned around. Many things which we keep private in our<br>
day to day lives are done so not because of any rational inconvenience to<br>
ourselves but because we do not wish to bother others.<br>
