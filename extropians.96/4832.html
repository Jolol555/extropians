<i>&gt; &gt; As would be his right until the moment he actually commits a crime that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violates another's individual rights. Guns don't kill people, people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kill people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; How come then that you in the states have twice the amount of gunshot</i><br>
<i>&gt; killings, then we do here in Denmark where privately owned guns are</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal?</i><br>
<p>
There is no cause and effect relationship between ownership and killings.<br>

<p>
Switzerland even has a higher ratio of gun ownership to their total  <br>
population and arguably may have even better statistics than Denmark.  <br>
Man does not kill by gun alone!  Culture is the root of the problem and <br>
mere acoutrements just leads to even more brutal slayings with proverbial <br>
blunt objects.<br>
<p>
If guns are banned, then two cultures being compared for mortal action <br>
should have the type of murder (blunt object) or (knife) if they are <br>
legal and that is a more important measure if a particular weapon is <br>
banned the statistics get skewed.  Denmark does have a distinct culture <br>
and many facets are arguably desirable to any Extropian.<br>
