I have enjoyed the debate about rates of growth in a situation<br>
where computers play some part in augmenting the (effective?)<br>
intelligence of researchers.<br>
<p>
I had missed the first part, so I'm not sure whether the computers<br>
help by allowing uploading and/or AI's, with possibly million-fold<br>
speedups of thought compared to human brains?  Or perhaps the change<br>
is less dramatic, things like hyperlinks and search engines to<br>
quickly find and disseminate research results, improved modelling<br>
engines to decrease research costs, better CAD/CAM facilities to<br>
speed up design cycles, etc.<br>
<p>
Speaking very broadly, most growth cycles have had either an exponential<br>
or "yeast curve" pattern.  The yeast curve looks exponential at first, but<br>
then slows down and hits a ceiling as some limiting factor is reached.<br>
This raises the (unextropian!) possibility that growth curves which<br>
today look exponential will also someday reach limits.<br>
<p>
Exponential growth can be characterized simply by the percent increase<br>
per year.  I believe economic growth has run around a few percent per<br>
year for many decades or even centuries.  Computer performance has<br>
increased more like 30 or 40 percent per year for the past few decades.<br>
<p>
So a couple of questions which arise are, could general economic growth<br>
rates move up to the rate of growth of computer performance, in case<br>
the economy somehow became tied much more closely to computers?<br>
<p>
And, will computer performance growth rates greatly increase because of<br>
some feedback mechanisms related to the enhancements computers themselves<br>
make possible?<br>
<p>
If the first were true, this would in itself be utterly revolutionary<br>
in its impact.  It's difficult to even conceive what life would be like<br>
in a world in which we would all be twice as rich, in real terms, every<br>
couple of years.  Even a decade of this kind of growth would completely<br>
transform the world, like centuries of progress today.  So it would be<br>
interesting to hear opinions on this question.<br>
<p>
The second question is more difficult to answer.  Realize that the<br>
dramatic rates of growth of computer technology already are made possible<br>
in large part due to feedback mechanisms.  Certainly the high performance<br>
chips of today could not be designed or simulated without the computers<br>
of a few years ago.  So feedback is already present, and in fact it is<br>
necessary to maintain these rapid doubling rates.<br>
<p>
The problem with trying to forecast this into the future is that<br>
there is also the factor of diminishing returns.  All these forms of<br>
economic growth benefit from feedback, but they face the problem that<br>
it may become harder and harder to extract improvements from nature.<br>
We pick the low hanging fruit first, and then the higher fruit takes<br>
more effort.  In fact there is no technology "just around the corner"<br>
which will guarantee to maintain current computer growth rates into the<br>
2010 time frame.  Many people expect to see a leveling off of computer<br>
performance before then as the fundamental technological limitations of<br>
silicon chips are reached.<br>
<p>
So, feedback by itself will not guarantee an increase in growth rates.<br>
Rather, you have to look at details of how much the feedback helps, in<br>
the face of whatever difficulties can be anticipated.  If the world<br>
economic growth rate did increase to a doubling time of two or three<br>
years, then presumably computer performance growth rates would benefit,<br>
as would virtually all other technologies.  But translating this into<br>
a specific increase in growth rates is going to be very difficult to<br>
do.<br>
