<p>
In talking about The Singularity we have, quite rightly, concentrated only on <br>
those things we know are possible, but I'm in a silly, irresponsible mood <br>
today. I don't want to talk about humdrum things like Immortality, <br>
Nanotechnology, Super Human Intelligence or Uploading, I want to talk about  <br>
things that are thought to be impossible, or at least not proven to be <br>
possible.<br>
<p>
I am certain that the first 7 things on the following list are impossible.  <br>
The question is, am I not only certain but correct too? I've included my own <br>
estimate of the probability that the statements are wrong. The error estimates  <br>
are based on nothing but my gut feeling and so are probably worthless, but <br>
these are the odds I would give if I were betting.   <br>
<p>
1) Faster than light travel is impossible.    <br>
   Probability of error .00000001%<br>
<p>
2) Faster than light signaling can not be done.    <br>
   Probability of error .0000001%<br>
<p>
3) We can never communicating with the past.     <br>
   Probability of error .0000001%  <br>
<p>
4) Inertia-less space drive would violate today's physics and tomorrow's too.     <br>
   Probability of error .00001%<br>
<p>
5) Spinning super conductive disks will never create an anti-gravity effect.    <br>
   Probability of error .00001%<br>
<p>
6) Picotechnology is impossible because structures would not be ridged.   <br>
   Probability of error .001%<br>
<p>
7) An advanced extraterrestrial civilization will never be discovered.    <br>
   Probability of error .01%<br>
<p>
8) A Quantum Computer will not be made in the next 15 years.   <br>
   Probability  of error 30%<br>
<p>
9) A Quantum Computer will never be made.    <br>
   Probability of error 60%<br>
<p>
10) Nothing in the future will surprise John Clark.     <br>
    Probability of error 100%<br>
<p>
11) My error estimates are correct.<br>
    Probability of error unknown.<br>
