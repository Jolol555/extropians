I just read a bizarre experimental report, `Collapse of a Quantum Field May<br>
Affect Brain Function', Nunn, Clarke and Blott  (in a new book edited by<br>
Hameroff, Kaszniak and Scott - TOWARD A SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE FIRST<br>
TUCSON DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES, MIT Press, 1996).  A couple of years back<br>
these bozos decided that if Penrose was right, a QT-controlled brainstate<br>
should be `collapsed' when it reaches the suitable one graviton mass.  So if<br>
you couple up an `observing' EEG machine to the relevant part of the brain,<br>
the ensemble will be heavier quicker (as it were), so the response should be<br>
better or faster.  It wasn't faster, but error rates on the experimental<br>
task were indeed lower.  I have no idea what this implies.  Always wear an<br>
EEG helmet in exams?  :)<br>
<p>
Here's a quote:<br>
<p>
`Forty two subject altogether were tested [following a pilot] and all<br>
results were used.  During control experiments there were no significant<br>
differences in performance dependent on EEG recording condition.  In<br>
standard experiments, subjects had fewer target misses when the EEG was<br>
being taken from the left duing the word test (P=0.05; the recording was<br>
from the region of the motor cortex); during the pattern test, there were<br>
more hits on non-targets (P=0.01) during left-sided recordings, that is,<br>
error frequency was reversed when doing the "mirror image" test.' (p. 333)<br>
<p>
`When applied to all findings from all subjects, this method showed a<br>
probability of 0.01 that the "signifiant" results were there by chance'. (ibid.)<br>
