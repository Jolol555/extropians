<i>&gt;  I'm just curious, but has any extropian or group of extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; started a company devoted to developing extropian technologies (or for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter, started any company at all)?  This might not only advantageous to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the extropian "cause", but it might be profitable as well. </i><br>

I'm about to try and do something like this "in my spare time." (yes, I know<br>
that sounds ridiculous.)  I have a friend who is working in business ("making<br>
deals" for a small telecom.) who has a variety of contacts with people at the<br>
business end of various enterprises.  We both have a physics background (he <br>
has a B.A. in physics and I'm about to recieve an M.S.)  Neural nets and <br>
genetic algorithms are interests of mine, so we're going to try and use his <br>
business experience and our combined technical knowledge to pass ourselves<br>
off as consultants for using neural nets for data mining for business <br>
applications.  That certainly seems like a fairly extropian area of technology <br>
to me, even if it doesn't necessarily involve the immediate creation of <br>
anything new.<br>
<p>
Anything useful (or negative) anybody has to say starting such an enterprise<br>
would be appreciated.<br>
