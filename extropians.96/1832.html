<p>
If companies "usually" have people with great skills digging ditches, then <br>
the  few that don't do this are the ones that will be successful and become <br>
huge corporations, the foolish prejudice companies will end up in the very <br>
ditch it asked the genius to dig.                                <br>

                    <br>
<p>
Yes, and that's because most people in advanced countries don't want those  <br>
crap jobs, I see absolutely nothing immoral in giving them to those that do.<br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;Okay, call me one of those crazy idealists, but what about                 </i><br>

                     <br>
<p>
In other words, if everyone was a nice person it would be a better world. <br>
So what else is new?  One (of many) problem with Socialism is that it assumes <br>
that everyone is a saint, it expects people to adapt to it, The Free Market <br>
on the other hand, adapts to people. I think the fundamental question you must <br>
ask yourself is, what do you intend to do with the people who disagree with <br>
you?  Millions of people, like me and the "evil" men running corporations, <br>
don't like your ideas at all. Would you let us heretics do our own thing and <br>
permit people to choose which camp to join, or will people like me end in  <br>
re- education camps until we see the error in our ways and make a public  <br>
recantation of our views.<br>

<i>                &gt;The farmer supports the builder of houses with food, while                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the builder of houses builds for the farmer</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I'm a farmer, I grow rhubarb, I give it to the house builder, he loves <br>
rhubarb.  I already have a good house, my car however is broken. A good car <br>
mechanic I know hates rhubarb, but he needs work done on his house, so I <br>
tell the builder to fix the mechanic's house not mine and tell the mechanic <br>
to fix my car. Everybody is happy and if there were just 3 of us on a desert<br>
island that would be the end of it, but in a modern society with billions of <br>
people in complex relationships things get very complicated very fast. We <br>
need something to keep track of all this, fortunately we have such a device, <br>
its called money.   <br>
<p>
                                                                <br>
<i>                &gt;My fundamental moral principle is that all forms of coercion       </i><br>
<i>                &gt;are bad</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I can't say I agree with that. If you were chasing me with a bloody ax, <br>
I would feel very little guilt about using quite strong coercion to stop you.<br>
                <br>
                       <br>
<i>                &gt;Noam Chomsky, definitely on my most admired  list.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I've read a little of his work as a social criticism, well... <br>
he's a fine linguist.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I think cooperation can produce the best item for the lowest                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;price    </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Fine, you have a perfect right to think that and act on it. I presume <br>
everyone  on this list believes in the Scientific Method, so let's put it to <br>
the test, start your socialist commune today, I'll stick with business, <br>
and we'll see which one turns out to be freer and more prosperous. I have no <br>
desire to stop  you, and anyway I have a pretty good idea which one of us <br>
will win the contest, but by all means, try to prove me wrong. If you do then <br>
you will have beaten me fair and square in the marketplace of ideas.<br>
<p>
I get the impression that our positions are not symmetric, that you do have a <br>
strong desire to stop me. If I'm wrong about that then I apologize and we <br>
have no disagreement over morality, only over the technical points of <br>
economics, and there is no need to worry about that, nature will let us know <br>
which one of us is correct, no doubt about it. <br>
