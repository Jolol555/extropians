Currently in our system your intelligence is merged with others' to help<br>
everybody find what they want, but nobody can find anything about your<br>
interests unless you explicitly declare them public (we have a separate<br>
privacy tag for each rating - not to mention that you choose any alias<br>
and there is no way you or your e-mail address can be found by the alias<br>
- again, unless you want them to).<br>
<p>
Definitely, you could be asked for personal information, and then it could<br>
be sold or published.  But you wouldn't use such a service, would you?<br>

<p>
There are some schemes for implicit collection of user preferences, and<br>
they seem promising.  Grouplens is working on some, too.<br>
<p>
Content so-good-its-addictive does not mean violation of privacy though.<br>
It means that an important part of intelligence that you rely on personally<br>
is now residing on the Net, and it's better than most others - unless your<br>
life is already so good, it's addictive.<br>
<p>
It looks more like the continuing partial uploading of your personality<br>
architecture into the Net, liberation of intelligence from meat, and growing<br>
integration of global intelligence (Ideally, I would like to see the result<br>
of this process as a flexibly integrated system with strong local protection).<br>
<p>
I love watching it happen, too.<br>
