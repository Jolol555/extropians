They would both be absolutely convinced that they were you because they would<br>
feel that they were you, and they would both be absolutely correct.<br>

I would certainly agree with that, I would even say that subjective <br>
experience is the only thing in life that is important, unfortunately the<br>
only subjective experience we will ever be able to detect directly is our<br>
own. Nobody can really believe that they are the only conscious being in the <br>
universe, so we must assume that when something acts intelligently it is<br>
conscious. A corollary of that is that when something acts like me it is me.<br>

<p>
<p>
The only way that could be true is if the essential thing that makes me be me<br>
can not be duplicated by any technology or even detected by the Scientific<br>
method, in other words if the religious people are right and I have a soul.<br>
Personally I would rate the chances that I have a soul as religions define it<br>
at about the same as the probability that I am the only conscious being in<br>
the universe.<br>

<p>
<p>
No. A Simulation may or may not be as good as the original because it uses<br>
simplifications and approximations. A Emulation doesn't use such shortcuts and<br>
is identical to the "original", in fact it is no longer meaningful to talk <br>
about originals and copies, both are original. My Emulation of Windows 95 <br>
running on my computer is just as good as Windows 95 running on your computer, <br>
better if I have more powerful hardware.<br>
<p>
Knowing your opinion on this subject, I hate to tell you this but, well, ....<br>
the good news is that there is nothing fake about you, the bad news is that<br>
you are a copy. You see, I have developed a pulse gamma ray laser that can <br>
make a hologram of the human brain, it does have the minor side effect of <br>
vaporizing the brain in question, but that is of little importance because<br>
before that happens, due to the very short duration of the pulse, it obtains <br>
information on the position and velocity of every molecule in the brain. <br>
I used my machine on you last week, I then used Nanotechnology (I developed <br>
that in my spare time you see) to reconstruct you. I made you with different <br>
atoms, but that is not important, science can find no difference between one <br>
hydrogen atom and another, and even in the normal course of events all the <br>
atoms in your body are different from the ones you had a year ago. I finished <br>
the reconstruction of you less than 5 minutes ago and sat you down in front <br>
of your computer reading the Extropian list. Very soon your friends will start <br>
asking you why they haven't seen you for the last week, just tell them you <br>
went fishing or something.<br>
