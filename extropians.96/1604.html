I'm amazed that no one has responded to my simple suggestion for keeping<br>
this list open: limit each member to three messages posted per day.<br>
<p>
I just received a few dozen messages from this list.  About 10 were from<br>
one person.  Several other messages had no real content.  Perhaps some sort<br>
of elite list or hierarchy of lists will be necessary in the future.  For<br>
now, however, a little discipline would fix things.<br>
<p>
If there were two lists -- one open and one closed -- you would simply see<br>
what I have proposed.  The people on the closed list would be those who<br>
post carefully.  The "open" list would become a repository for people who<br>
feel the need to share their every conscious thought.<br>
