Desktop Personal Information Managers (PIMs), appointment books and <br>
to-do lists can be useful.  I have built my own system using a <br>
Hewlett-Packard Palmtop PC.  I have dutifully digitized 'every' moment <br>
of my waking life (and what I can recall of my nocturnal dreams) for <br>
several years.<br>
<p>
With this database, I can:<br>
<p>
* Tell you the distribution of my waking activity last week: 30% work <br>
(hours billable to my employer), 27% study, 21% 'maintenance' (mundane <br>
health and household stuff), 8% family (direct, 'quality' time), 14% <br>
'play' (events I categorize as personal and social entertainment).  I <br>
can also tell you that these figures fluctuate up and down by only a <br>
few percentage points each week, on the average. (BTW, knowing <br>
precisely how much time I 'waste' on the mundane stuff gives me a <br>
benchmark for reducing it.)<br>
<p>
* Quickly summarize the work I've been doing when status reports are <br>
requested.<br>
<p>
* Tell you exactly what I was doing at 8pm on Dec 16, 1994 (for no <br>
good reason that I've yet been able to think of :-).<br>
<p>
* Document every discussion with my associates, wife, or 'learning <br>
sessions' with my daughter.<br>
<p>
* maintain 'bookmarks' for thought streams that have intrigued me but <br>
have had to be shelved due to the demands of work and family.<br>
<p>
* Keep notes from books I've read as well as extracts from electronic <br>
sources, such as the Web and mailing lists.<br>
<p>
Of course, you might ask, what does this effort cost and is it worth <br>
it?  Well, several points:<br>
<p>
* It takes roughly 4 to 6% of my waking time (less if I skip the <br>
interesting details).<br>
<p>
* Is it worth it?  Well ... I enjoy it, it helps me organize my life, <br>
track trends, recall the past - 'dumping' alot of the mundane details <br>
to this archive seems to free up my mind for more creative thinking.<br>
<p>
* Could I live without it? Of course! I always rely on my organic <br>
computer for moment by moment insights and decisions. Still, without <br>
this record I doubt if I would coherently remember most of those <br>
priceless brainstorms I have when I 'extrope'.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't expect many to become an obsessive diarist like me.  Even I <br>
don't much care that last Jan 22 I had rice with chicken, peas, <br>
carrots and tomato sauce soup, with brocoli, for dinner. (It took <br>
about 45 seconds to randomly select, load and find that entry.)<br>
<p>
Still, for me, this is primarily an interesting experiment in the <br>
mechanics of tracking experience that a digitized upload might have to <br>
deal with.<br>
<p>
Someone mentioned how paper-based approaches, like Day Timers, are <br>
more reliable and accessible.  This is certainly true for anyone who <br>
has to commute to work and doesn't have a desktop computer in every <br>
room.<br>
<p>
However, my HP200 LX with a 10 megabyte flash disk (40-50 megabyte <br>
cards are common but still expensive) costs about $1000, operates on <br>
two AA (1.5v) batteries for several weeks, even with heavy use, and <br>
fits comfortably in my pocket.  It can be used anytime, anywhere. <br>
Well, I don't think I'd use it to try and record conversations at a <br>
party in real time; but, it is great for recording that brilliant idea <br>
you have just before falling asleep, without having to get out of <br>
bed!<br>
<p>
HP's keyboard, with sticky shift and function keys is an ergonomic <br>
marvel - I can hold a magazine in one hand and type in some quotes <br>
from an article with the other (while standing up on a crowded bus). <br>
Most importantly, when I turn this pocket PC on, the database, <br>
spreadsheet and word processor are instantly available, in the same <br>
state I left them in when I last turned off the machine.  You don't <br>
get that kind of instant access with desktop bloatware; and, once you <br>
get used to it, you don't want to settle for less.<br>
