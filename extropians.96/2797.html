Wow.  You must have a chip on your shoulder, Mike.  I have spent <br>
quite a bit of my life in public schools and public libraries, and I was <br>
always treated like a human being.  I haven't had much occasion to use <br>
other government facilities, except post offices.  I hate going to the <br>
post office, it's a zoo, but if I am friendly to the clerks, they are usually <br>
friendly to me.  I have also been treated in a friendly manner by the <br>
staff in public parks, swimming pools, etc.  <br>
<p>
I have run into a certain amount of rudeness, but very little of it <br>
was in government facilities.  <br>
