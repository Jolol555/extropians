I realize, I was talking about designs for city structures in the real world<br>
and environment designs in upload VR.<br>

Yes and I want to know people's fantasy worlds or what type of environment<br>
they'd like to live in. The latter dealt with designs for city structures in<br>
the real world.<br>

<i>&gt;Trying to predict, how artificial reality will look like, which Beings it </i><br>

<i>&gt;will be different.</i><br>
<p>
Of course things will be completely different but why not fantacize (sp?)<br>
now and use our creativity to come up with some good ideas on general design<br>
themes so that we can begin building our worlds right after we're uploaded<br>
having already thought the design through and as we get closer we can add to<br>
it and make it more vivid? Also you meantion loss of time. What do you mean<br>
loss of time? The singularity is right around the corner and you or I can do<br>
nothing to stop it even if we wanted to. What could stop the singularity?<br>
Hire a hitman to take out Eric Drexler? Traces of Terminator 2.<br>
