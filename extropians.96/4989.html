Sorry, can't let you get away with that. Microsoft does *more* usability<br>
testing than anyone. They may have often produced buggy first versions of<br>
products (hardly unique), but they learn fast and end up with the best.<br>
<p>
For all you blindly anti-Microsoft types (or even the seeing anti-MS types),<br>
I recommend The Microsoft Way by Randall Stross. Also essential reading for<br>
anyone wanting to lead their industry.<br>
<p>
I think the term "MicroSloth" though perhaps emotionally satisfying to some,<br>
is truly absurd. If *any* company is the opposite of slothful it's<br>
Microsoft. And if there is anything Gates and company value more than<br>
effort, it's high intelligence.<br>
<p>
BTW, another thing I like about Microsoft, is that they are *tripling* their<br>
budget for long-term basic research at a time when almost everyone else is<br>
cutting it. MS is here for the long term.<br>
<p>
Anyone else using and loving MS FrontPage for creating and managing web sites.<br>
