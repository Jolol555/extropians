<i>&gt;&gt;*sigh*. I grok a value off it. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, i am glad you grok ( what grokking a value off of something is, i am</i><br>
not sure, but the sentiment is nice).<br>
<p>
Imagine considering a matter from a distance, and apprehending it <br>
with its surroundings. One is not grokking the thing, but one _may_<br>
nonetheless grok what values emanate. OK? :) Ain't English grand?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is the first I have heard you</i><br>
speak of it. Are you an artist?<br>
<p>
Well, I don't have a huge portfolio and my calling has been spotty, <br>
but I have done poetry, songwriting, spoken word, comedy, cartooning, <br>
kinetic stuff and a few other things. I have a mixed-media sorbothane, <br>
microprocessor and welded-puddle piece in mind that will require my <br>
learning how to weld, at which point I suppose I could claim to be <br>
a sculptor. :)<br>
<p>
Am I an artist? :) They say an artist can't help creating, and if that's true <br>
then for a long disthymic time I was not an artist... &lt;1/2 g&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Or not.  I'd rather *do* art, and tell my frineds about it. :) :) :)</i><br>
Idea: Go do art and tell us about it. :) :) or tell *me*, anyway. :)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Go do art? hmmm.....Well, it would be kind of hard for me to work any harder</i><br>
at it than I am right now... but if you want to hear a discription of my art<br>
email me offlist! January I will put up a site and I will notify the list.<br>
       That is what the thread is ( talking) about. We are talking about a<br>
forum to talk_ about talking about the art we are doing. : )<br>
<p>
A thousand apologies. I came in late. Somehow I thought it was going <br>
to be more like an art history thing. My error!<br>
