Why do you continue nattering about this topic as if you had never<br>
heard of steganography?<br>
<p>
I'm not going to look up the numbers and do the math for you (you're<br>
such a math genius I'm sure you can handle that yourself), but if<br>
you think the US federal government, or any government, has the<br>
resources not only to scan for and identify all encrypted messages<br>
in transit but also to single out the messages that are using<br>
stronger than usual encryption, especially when you add in the<br>
factor of steganography...  well, actually, I know that you don't<br>
think that. You're not *that* stupid. You're just up to your usual<br>
tricks, sowing Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt whereever and whenever<br>
you think it will turn the game to your advantage.<br>
<p>
I know the NSA and other narc groups have black budgets, but the<br>
black budgets are simply not large enough to do surveillance as<br>
complete as you describe on as much bandwidth as they'd have to<br>
monitor to create the illusory dangers you are depicting.  Various<br>
government bodies in the United States only eat about fifty percent<br>
of the economy, and most of that is accounted for outside of the<br>
black budgets. The kind of surveillance you describe would be so<br>
expensive that it would leave a signal in the accounting books at<br>
the macro level. <br>
<p>
Try again, Herr FUD. Perhaps you can describe us some sectors of<br>
the underground economy we've never heard of, and paint a pretty<br>
picture about how these sectors are funding the narcs in their<br>
nefarious schemes you'd like us to believe in.<br>
