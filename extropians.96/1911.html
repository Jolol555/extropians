<p>
That would of course be a "natural" supernova, based on the same <br>
principles as real supernovae. I think just a major flare-up would be <br>
enough for most purposes. <br>
<p>
The trick is to get the star to increase its energy output drastically. <br>
In a supernova, the core collapses until a "rebounce" occurs when a lot <br>
of energy is released and shockwaves appear due to exclusion forces. If <br>
we could induce a helium flash in the sun we would get a much smaller <br>
effect, but probably enough to devastate the inner planets. And that <br>
could perhaps be induced by compressing the core using technomagic, but <br>
it sounds quite hard. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;           Moreover, a supernova explodes at only about 15000 km/sec, </i><br>
<i>&gt;           which an advanced civilisation could perhaps be possible to </i><br>
<i>&gt;           run away from. A lot of the energy is also released in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;           form of neutrinos, which travel at approximately the speed </i><br>
<i>&gt;           of light; but then again there is a very small cross section </i><br>
<i>&gt;           for neutrino reactions, so one could stand a very heavy </i><br>
<i>&gt;           neutrino shower without getting hurt.</i><br>
<p>
Apparently (according to what I read in the latest thread on this subject <br>
in rec.arts.sf.science a year back), the neutrino shower is so intense <br>
that it can be deadly in the entire solar system. And the x-ray pulse is <br>
going at c (but delayed compared to the neutrinos), so the civilization <br>
will have to run very fast. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;           An "electomagnetic pulse of unspeakable amplitude" (Forrest </i><br>
<i>&gt;           Bishop) would also seem like science fiction proper.</i><br>
<p>
OK, here is an absurd weapon me and my friends cooked up: Create a <br>
toroidal black hole by fusing a lot of stars into a big ring. It will <br>
collapse near c, and drag together the galactic magnetic field inside the <br>
loop. Once it collapses topology change has to occur or it will have to <br>
radiate away the collected energy - the result will still be a nasty <br>
blast of gravity waves and emp. Not that it is particularly efficient <br>
(compare this to the cosmic string weapons of _Ring_ by Baxter and _Tides <br>
of Light_ by Benford). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;           It is important that we use realistic assumptions about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;           conditions of cosmic warfare in our simulations. Since there </i><br>
<i>&gt;           are still many unsolved problems in fundamental physics, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;           suggest we set up several simulations with different </i><br>
<i>&gt;           parameters for weapon technology. There are several relevant </i><br>
<i>&gt;           variables here, such as projectile speed, production cost, </i><br>
<i>&gt;           identifiability of aggressor, technology level required for </i><br>
<i>&gt;           its manufacture, discrimination capabilities ("hurt only the </i><br>
<i>&gt;           bad guys"), etc. Maybe the time is ripe to begin to try to </i><br>
<i>&gt;           really work this out.</i><br>
<p>
Good points. Personally I think this kind of hyperweapons we discuss <br>
above are very unlikely - they are too indiscriminate and require a lot <br>
of energy/work. "Perversion attacks" a la Vinge are more likely - <br>
infiltrate the enemy with nanites or AI viruses, and then destroy him <br>
subtly. One could imagine tiny berzerkers (gremlins?) that move around a <br>
la von Neumann probes, and when they find a civilization they study it, <br>
send out very subtle agents, and then plans its downfall using SI. <br>
