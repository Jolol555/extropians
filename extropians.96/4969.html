There's a phenomenon of "layering" in the development of religions.<br>
It is both diachronic and synchronic. The paganized versions of<br>
the saints that reemerge in the practice of Catholicism in some<br>
areas is one example; the encrustation of superstition that surrounds<br>
(or is embedded within) Mahayana Buddhism is another.<br>
<p>
Conversion by the sword is a Skinnerian conversion. It can affect<br>
only behavior, not the contents of the heart. It lays a behavioristic<br>
veneer over a culture; but Skinnerians have faith that over time<br>
the behavioristic veneer will leak into the heart. I suspect that<br>
this conversion stratagem works better on some cultures than on<br>
others.<br>
<p>
As for what you say about the supposed nature of religion, I guess<br>
that you're referring to the purportedly deep connection between<br>
religion and morality. Bill Bartley, a philosopher whose opinions<br>
I happen to respect, wrote a monograph on just that subject which<br>
I recommend, although it's a bit difficult to find. I found my copy<br>
at a used bookstore in Berkeley.<br>
<p>
(Obviously I'm not talking about blood pumps here; by "heart" I<br>
mean some kind of poorly specified motivational information structure<br>
encoded somehow in the physical structure of the nervous system,<br>
and "which one" I mean to pick out by this is best expressed by<br>
the traditional metaphorical term "heart".  I know this sounds<br>
pedantic, but I'm trying not to get tagged a "sensitive New Age<br>
guy" here. I've got a reputation to maintain, after all.  ;)<br>
<p>
It just occurred to me that hearts are probably different in<br>
different cultures. The very notion of "heart" I'm talking about<br>
might or might not be a purely cultural phenomenon, depending on<br>
your opinions about the plasticity of mind. That's the way it is<br>
with the vaguest sorts of social and psychological abstractions...<br>
anything said about them can be understood as a self-fulfilling<br>
prophecy, and therefrom an ulterior motive can always be inferred.<br>
That's probably why we prefer to keep our discourse concrete.<br>
