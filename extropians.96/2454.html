<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;For a fictional treatment of MPE, see Walter John William's _Aristoi_, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;where practically all people have AI-supported independent </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;subpersonalities doing multitask work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you speaking of the concept of a person playing multiple roles?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is the first step, I have a transhumanist friend who actually has </i><br>
<i>&gt; developed three "interface" personalities to deal with different roles. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A deeper version would be different *real* personalities that you can </i><br>
<i>&gt; shift between as needed, perhaps with different skills and worldviews. It </i><br>
<i>&gt; would also be useful if they could co-exist mentally, to give advise and </i><br>
<i>&gt; discuss problems. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The last possibility is closest to _Aristoi_: the daimons (as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subpersonalities are called) have different roles and skills. For example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gabriel (the protagonist) has a logical and scientifically minded daimon</i><br>
<i>&gt; called Horus, Spring Rain is manipulative and social while Psyche is pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; poetry. So when Gabriel wants to develop a nanosystem, he puts Horus on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the job while he, helped by Spring Rain, converses with some VIPs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; another daimon deals with incoming mail. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
My friend was hypnotizing me a few weeks ago, and we were trying to see if<br>
he could make me ambidextrous. What he did was have me envision the<br>
different parts of my brain, and have them talk to each and decide how<br>
they could implement it. I don't remember the details, but it worked for<br>
a while. I could put together a fairly coherent sentence while writing<br>
with my left hand. <br>
<p>
While I wouldn't want any other personalities mucking around in my head,<br>
I'm really interested in the concept of daimons allowing me to multitask.<br>
Much like an artificial version of Zen martial arts, where the physical<br>
processes are handled by some AI so I'm not conscious of them, so my<br>
higher mind can work on things like tactics.  <br>
<p>
They wouldn't have much decision making power outside their little sphere,<br>
but they would certainly help with trivial things.<br>
<p>
Would hypnosis help in developing independent "daimons" in my mind?<br>
