<p>
An H bomb produces millions of times as much energy per pound as the sun<br>
does because it does not rely on the very slow reactions of the most common<br>
isotope of Hydrogen (H1) like the sun does. Thermonuclear bombs use a much<br>
faster reaction than the sun does, it works by fusing deuterium (H2) and<br>
tritium (H3). In nature only about one atom in a thousand Hydrogen atoms is<br>
deuterium and tritium is virtually nonexistent.<br>
<p>
An H bomb has much better fuel than the sun does, and even the best fuel will<br>
not burn if the conditions are not right. The rate at which a fusion reaction<br>
occurs is a function not only of the temperature of the mixture but also its<br>
density. In an H bomb the fission trigger heats the deuterium and tritium to<br>
a temperature of about 400,000,000 degrees Kelvin, much hotter than anything<br>
in the sun, and it also compresses it until it is several times denser than <br>
lead. If you set off an H bomb at the center of Jupiter little would happen. <br>
A very small amount of Jupiter's hydrogen would fuse, but that would make <br>
heat and the heat would make things expand and that would reduce the density <br>
and that would stop the reaction very quickly. The pressure at the center of <br>
Jupiter is just too small to confine the fusing Hydrogen.<br>
<p>
If Jupiter were 50 times bigger things would be different, then the pressure<br>
at the center would be so great that when the fusion reaction started the heat<br>
would not be able to expand the Hydrogen enough to stop the reaction. This is<br>
what happens in the sun, a balance between the heat produced by fusion<br>
reactions that wants the sun to expand, and gravity that wants the sun to<br>
contract. Eventually gravity always wins. When its hydrogen fuel has all been<br>
converted into helium ash the sun will contract into a white dwarf, if it was<br>
twice as big it would end life as a Neutron Star, it is was twice as big again<br>
it would contract into a Black Hole.<br>
<p>
I'm pleased to note that I'm not the only nut who liked to make things go<br>
boom when he was a kid. When I was 9 I made some interesting blue gunk with<br>
my Chemistry set, liquid plant food and some household cleaners, I'm not <br>
exactly sure what it was, my note keeping was not all that it should have <br>
been, but I do know that it blew up. I have a very small scar under my left <br>
eye to this day.<br>
