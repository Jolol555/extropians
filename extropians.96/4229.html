<i>&gt;When I was 35 I started playing a video game.  I became obsessed with </i><br>
<i>&gt;it.  I would play for hours at a time.  This could be considered a form of </i><br>
<i>&gt;meditation.  The game required very fast eye-hand coordination (with </i><br>
<i>&gt;both hands), and it required intense visual concentration -- not on an </i><br>
<i>&gt;unchanging pattern, as in some forms of meditation, but on a moving </i><br>
<i>&gt;pattern, which was just what I needed.   The breakthrough came about </i><br>
<i>&gt;six months after I started playing the game.  Something snapped </i><br>
<i>&gt;one afternoon, and that was when I started getting my strength back.  </i><br>
<p>
Sonic The Hedgehog? I remember when I first played that video game it was<br>
faster than any predecessor and at first I had a difficult time following<br>
the action onscreen but I eventually 'grew' to the point where it began to<br>
appear running more slowly. The same thing occurs with newer better<br>
processors. Sure increasingly bloated applications slow down the system,<br>
but as soon as you used a system with a dramatically higher processor speed<br>
you're system appears EXTREMELY slow. This makes me wonder if we will<br>
notice the singularity at all. Some people see the singularity as a point<br>
in time when instantly things will be different. Sure, when the first<br>
nanite is created it will take time to come up with a better design and a<br>
better design and an even better design not even taking into consideration<br>
that there all nanites will be specialized and there will be no all-purpose<br>
nanite just as there is no all-purpose cell type that encompases the entire<br>
human body. Things will speed up but it will appear as gradual progress to<br>
us. In the 1990s more technological progress than in the history of mankind<br>
will occur. Pretty soon it will only take half a decade, and then a quarter<br>
and get smaller and smaller but time will appear to run just as it always<br>
has from our perspective. Perhaps the Great Filter is that the biological<br>
clocks of all alien races run at different speeds and that clocks similar<br>
to ours are many many lightyears away. Time is entirely based on our<br>
perception as anyone under the influence of certain mind-altering drugs can<br>
tell you.<br>
