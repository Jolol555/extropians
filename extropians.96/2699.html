<i>&gt; I would correct this statement, to make it more accurate.  It was *PEOPLE in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the businesses* who dumped the waste.  There were certain, specific </i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals who dumped that waste, and the fact that they were business owners </i><br>
<i>&gt; has as much relevance as their skin or eye color to the fact that they were so </i><br>
<i>&gt; unethical that they would do such a horrible thing.  These polluters are </i><br>
<i>&gt; highly unethical people who HAPPEN to be business owners as well.  Being </i><br>
<i>&gt; business owners didn't *cause* them to be evil polluters.  Capitalism doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; CAUSE people to be unethical.  Yes, there are unethical people who trade in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the capitalist system who ALSO do very bad things, but to decry all of </i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism and business because of the acts of a few assholes who fuck people </i><br>
<i>&gt; over is as stupid and irrational as being racist because one black guy attacks </i><br>
<i>&gt; you and steals your clothes.</i><br>
<p>
Capitalism encourages people to be unethical. The most unethical can be <br>
the most profitable, althought this is not always the case, it happens <br>
way too frequently. The amount of environmental damage one person <br>
can do when he doesn't have total control over a large organization is far less. <br>
On his own he could pollute a small piece of land, as the <br>
businessman he can destroy an entire ecosystem. Capitalism gives power to <br>
the unethical so they can do more damage. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suresh, you're over-generalizing, BIG-TIME!  You're standing in the middle of </i><br>
<i>&gt; a battlefield, blowing away friend and enemy alike.  "The enemies are humans; </i><br>
<i>&gt; shoot the enemies.  All humans are enemies; shoot all humans"  is the same as </i><br>
<i>&gt; "The bad people who pollute and fuck people over are business people; stop </i><br>
<i>&gt; them from committing their evil acts.  All business people are evil; stop all </i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses."  Both are examples of very bad logic.  Yet this is exactly the </i><br>
<i>&gt; logic you are using.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The bad people who pollute and fuck over people are the ones with the <br>
most power in capitalism. That's a method of getting rich, forfeiting <br>
ethics in favour of profits. Thus, the ones who get power are the <br>
unethical ones. You may call it pragmatic, but I call it nasty. This is <br>
the logic I'm following: Profits can be earned by the nastiest methods <br>
possible, thus the unethical  ones in society will accumulate the most <br>
money, and thus power. <br>
<p>
While I acknowledge that not all business people are evil, some are <br>
ignorant of the effects their number crunching has on other people, and <br>
some are trying to help, but don't know how to do it and remain <br>
competitive. It's very hard to be nice and <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Check your thinking; you've got a bad meme in there somewhere, trying to take </i><br>
<i>&gt; over your mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Find out what the REAL enemy is.  It's not business.  It's not even </i><br>
<i>&gt; government.  There's something much deeper.  And until you understand the real </i><br>
<i>&gt; sources of the world's problems, all your grand plans for society will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; misguided and ineffective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Okay, can you tell me??? If I find it I'll let you know. I really wish<br>
there was some cabal of people (y'know, like the Roscrucians, Freemasons,<br>
Illuminati, Communists, Capitalists, Muppets, Extropians) making<br>
the world bad, then at least you could direct efforts to topple it.<br>
<p>
 But I guess the fault lies with<br>
ourselves, and all the failings currently being human entails. This isn't<br>
something you can fight without indoctorination or massive dosages of<br>
Prozac(Television?).<br>
<p>
 The<br>
reason I advocate anarchy is because I hope it will<br>
encourage the same principles of mutual aid that have helped us evolve to<br>
this point, so we can develop into a species that will take itself to the<br>
stars. &lt;ahhh, starry dreamy eyes&gt;<br>
<p>
(I hate vi)<br>
<p>
I know the real enemy is not big business. But they are a sore point in<br>
society. The real enemy is .... RICHARD SIMMONDS(sorry...I'll take my<br>
methadone). It sucks that people are sometimes rapacious, brutal and<br>
savage,but<br>
that's why we need to keep power imbalances from happening, so that<br>
nobody, regardless of how "benevolent", can dictate terms to anyone else.<br>
The last thing anybody wants is to have brutal people have power over you,<br>
so the only way to prevent this from happening is to minimize the absolute <br>
power anyone has over anybody else.<br>
     <br>
<p>
Let's face it, any system would work if people were a bit "nicer". <br>
