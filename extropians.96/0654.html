<p>
I don't see why, I was referring to myself and that is how I see it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Admittedly, you coined</i><br>

<i>&gt;sloppy.</i><br>
<p>
I did develop its concept as I saw it at the time.  You just didn't agree<br>
with it.  You asked me for a definition, while I stated that I did see how<br>
it could be defined in that I was beginning to doubt its significance or<br>
purpose, i.e., superfluous adjective. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You left it to the rest of us on the &gt;H list to define it, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that was surely good for the subject matter and for the community. </i><br>
<p>
Not define it completely, but to explore it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Our</i><br>
<i>&gt;work didn't take the path you expected, it took the path that those that</i><br>
<i>&gt;worked on it determined, which can't be a surprise to anyone.</i><br>
<p>
Not exactly.  It took several paths, as so expressed by the number of people<br>
who participated in voicing views.  Some I agreed with, others I did not.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you want an ideology that meets your own requirements exactly, I'm</i><br>

<p>
Gee thanks Rich!  But, no, I don't have to develop an new ideology, I am<br>
already a Transhuman Extropian. And, I'm quite happy with that now. I can,<br>
however, develop _myself_ and this action brings me great joy.  I'm<br>
automorphing my individual freedom.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
