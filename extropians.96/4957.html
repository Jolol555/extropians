Hal was thinking about a pilot PDA:<br>
&lt;A couple of people have complained about losing data through various <br>
mishaps.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, one advantage to these devices is their instant-on capability of <br>
bringing you right back to the application you were using when you <br>
last shut it off.  One of the disadvantages is that it's easy to lose <br>
what you've recorded if the application gets stuck. (Cutting and <br>
pasting between applications is the most common source of hangups in <br>
my HP Palmtop).  The solution is to have a PCMCIA flash-card and back <br>
things up to it early and often.<br>
<p>
&lt;The input is done using Graffiti, a stylized pen gesture system, or <br>
by poking at an on-screen keyboard.&gt;<br>
<p>
The new HP Omnigo is new and unique, I think, in that it has a <br>
'fold-over' screen that covers the keyboard if you want to use it with <br>
a stylus.<br>
<p>
Anyone planning to buy a palmtop or PDA might want to check out <br>
mailorder from Educalc at<br>
<a href="http://www.educalc.com">http://www.educalc.com</a><br>
They mostly sell HP LX200's, Omnigos, Omnibooks, but they also sell <br>
Sharp's Zaurus, Psion, Envoy, Netwon and Pilot.  They also sell all <br>
the accessories (beware, these can easily cost as much as the PC <br>
itself).<br>
