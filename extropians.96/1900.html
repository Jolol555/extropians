Steve Witham's post reminds me of an idea from the last chapter of <br>
Stanislaw Lem's _A Perfect Vacuum_, an oration by a (fictional) cosmologist, <br>
who proposes to explain physics as the product of a cosmic Game (in the<br>
sense of game theory: i.e. a contest or a situation of conflict). The<br>
idea is that the first technological civilizations have engineered the <br>
universe in order that they will stay out of each other's way. Thus the <br>
speed-of-light limit, the expansion of space, and so on. This is not the<br>
result of consensus, but of game-theoretic calculation: according to the<br>
theory, keeping oneself isolated is apparently the best course of action.<br>
As a side effect, latecomers to the universe find themselves isolated as<br>
well.<br>
<p>
In this cosmology, the observed state of the cosmos which we see is the <br>
work of intelligence, but it's not meant to be an information carrier for <br>
superintelligences or a stockpile of raw materials; it's a buffer zone<br>
between widely separated, hard-to-see zones of intelligent activity.<br>
