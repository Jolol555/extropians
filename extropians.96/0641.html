Currently, robotics does not provide us with machines capable of robust <br>
navigation, vision, etc. AI is a somewhat unfortunate term, since it is <br>
still loaded with strong AI things like Lisp workstations, expert <br>
systems, inference engines &amp; the like. This is brittle stuff which has <br>
nothing to do with robust robotics.<br>
<p>
Furthermore robots are far from being cheap. They do not autoreplicate.<br>
On the other hand, they are tireless &amp; accurate (no labor's union <br>
membership, too) if it comes to doing well defined, tasks requiring little <br>
sensorics nor complex realtime processing of input. Most are still <br>
dedicated automates, not all-purpose reprogrammable robots. Statistics <br>
lie, sometimes.<br>
 <br>
But you just can't trust idiots running a car assembly line. (This is not <br>
a 3-banana problem).<br>

Hmm, I failed to notice a dramatic increase in the use of robots just <br>
lately. Manual labor has still a fair niche. Only large hardware ANNs <br>
will change this situation, and these are unlikely to appear too soon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; hit the market, AI should already have a considerable marketshare of </i><br>

<p>
If AI=dumb robots, then yes.<br>
<p>

<p>
You know, most people don't like being unemployed. Trivial things like <br>
housing, food, clothing, and such. They might get pissed sufficiently to <br>
start an insurrection. There are some areas in Krautland with 15% <br>
unemployment, trend's still up.<br>
   <br>
<i>&gt; A big question is how much will it cost to maintain a drone work force.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sure that genetic engineers could make more efficient organisms than </i><br>
<i>&gt; those currently available, but they'll still need food and waste </i><br>
<p>
I know a bit about DNA tinkering, and I think this damn unlikely. This is <br>
one of the reasons why I don't fear genetically modified organisms <br>
release in ecosystems _which are in equilibrium_. Alas, most things <br>
humane are not. Woe! Fear the engineered virus. Welcome to Project Blue.<br>

<i>&gt; removal.  Who will provide the mindless service of feeding and clean up </i><br>

<p>
If they are sufficiently smart to operate the machinery, they sure are <br>
smart enough to feed themselves.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Moral Question: How is bulding an race of drones in a laboratory for </i><br>
<i>&gt; labor different from just building designer humans to perform those same </i><br>
<i>&gt; tasks?  Would these humans be created or enslaved?</i><br>
<p>
This is pure slavery, of course. Tinkering with human DNA to produce a <br>
race of slaves is immoral as hell, imo. Currently, _any_ tinkering with <br>
human DNA is a strong no no since the yield is so low. Site directed <br>
mutagenesis or DNA snipping/insertion is easy on bacteria where you <br>
select automagically e.g. by ampicillin resistancy, but just try this on <br>
human embryos. 99.999 % nonviable. Hoo, boy.<br>
