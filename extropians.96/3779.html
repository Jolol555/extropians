Geoff Ryman's 1989 novel _The Child Garden_ (winner of Clarke &amp; <br>
Campbell awards) also envisioned 'plant humans' in several ways:<br>
<p>
&lt;[1] People were purple. Their skins flooded with a protein called <br>
Rhodopsin ... In light, Rhodopsin broke down into sodium and combined <br>
carbon and water. People photosynthesized.  It was a way of feeding <br>
them all.&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;[2] Child Gardens were where orphans were raised ... Viruses made <br>
people cheerful and helpful and honest. Their manners were impeccable, <br>
their conversation well-informed, their work speedy and accurate. They <br>
believed the same things.&gt;<br>
<p>
(Hmmm, sounds alot like David Pearce's Hedonistic Imperative - only <br>
much gentler!)<br>
<p>
&lt;[3] Almost no one lives past 40 ... Everyone was Read at ten years <br>
old, by the Party ... models were made of their personalities. These <br>
models joined the government to be consulted.  The government was <br>
called the Consensus ... The Consensus was a garden of purple, fleshy <br>
trees that reached up and fed on sunlight.  The mind of the Consensus <br>
was below ... A computer made of flesh, growing new capacity when it <br>
needed it, sending mycelia through the earth, sprouting elsewhere like <br>
mushrooms ...&gt;<br>
<p>
Ryman's story is "a bit more subtle than that"; but, while the society <br>
is definitely transhuman, it's not particularly extropian.  Ryman <br>
summarizes it thus:<br>
&lt;... a culture that replicated itself endlessly, but which never gave <br>
birth to anything new.&gt;<br>
