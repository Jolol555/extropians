"We at the Department of Applied Theology don't have much to do in the<br>
absence of uberminds and Powers, so we spend our time annoying people.<br>
Having previously noted the similarities between faith in the<br>
Singularity, the Rapture, and the Apocalypse, we now move on to the<br>
modern technosoul.  In the past death was not considered a problem<br>
because one's soul continued on some other plane.  Then one lived on<br>
through one's children, or occasionally through one's ideas.  Now the<br>
latter is achieving new prominence in the transhuman movement as many<br>
claim contentment with living on through their memes, or the body of<br>
knowledge they leave behind, or through AI children.  Not that any of<br>
this is entirely _new_ of course, but given the general materialist<br>
views of the members of the movement and denigration of religion, such<br>
appeal to immortality through the preservation of static bits, as<br>
opposed to 'the childish faith in a living, immortal soul' is going to<br>
raise at least a few eyebrows, if not some open ridicule."<br>
