Hey, I'd like to see that list too, please (when you're finished, that <br>
is...)!  I've recently began exploring the tecno-ambiant genre and like <br>
what I hear. I'm new to it, and I don't know anyone who's into already, <br>
so it's hit or miss and I only know of a handfull of artists.  The Future <br>
Sound of London "Accelerator" disk has some, IMO, extropic themes, but it <br>
was recorded in 1992.  I'd be hip to hearing some newer sounds <br>
intertwined with tasty memes. <br>
<p>
 I have built a substantial music<br>
collection of several hundred titles on CD and wax, but they're almost <br>
exclusively from a pre-extropic era.  It sucks to have to beutiful music <br>
infected with unsavory ideas, especially when I've invested serious (to <br>
me) funds in collecting them!  Such are the trials of evolution.<br>
<p>
In addition to not having a readsy source to sample new techno-ambiant <br>
music, I also lack a garden to buy it from.  Indianapolis, Indiana does <br>
not (yet) have a specialty shop catering to my needs.  Can you refer me <br>
to mail order services or retailers of interest?  How about your work?<br>
