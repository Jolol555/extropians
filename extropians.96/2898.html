<i>&gt; There is a difference between be willing and being able.  The White House</i><br>

<p>
They are not monolithic. They only appear so until someone is brave<br>
enough to point out that the Emperor has no clothes, and not worry about<br>
getting his head cut off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The phrase "we take care of our own" has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;many meanings, some of which are pretty insidious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are right about naval vessels.  My experience with the U.S. Military,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, is somewhat different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And, I see other revelations coming out of the military almost daily.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; people are willing to circumvent the system to reveal sex scandels, I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; think some would do the same for mass murder.</i><br>
<p>
Yes there are members who have not been properly "taken care of". Many<br>
women still do not feel like they are treated as part of the military,<br>
or only view it as a way to get free education, or try to use the system<br>
for personal aggrandizement. I've witnessed flase harassment cases<br>
personally. Not against myself, but against others. I was the key<br>
witness in a case in which two female airmen framed a male airman with<br>
such claims. If I had not overheard them talking about it beforehand,<br>
his life would be over.<br>
<p>
I am not saying the truth may not come out. If some agency with<br>
equivalent power shows an interest in invesigating this in earnest, I<br>
can guarrantee that any witnesses will come out of the woodwork. Until<br>
such a time, the operating rule among lower ranking people is: COVER<br>
YOUR ASS, SQUEAKY WHEELS GET TOSSED OVERBOARD, and WHISTLE BLOWERS GET<br>
IT JAMMED DOWN THEIR THROATS. I've been there, done that, I know what I<br>
am talking about. Anyone with a tale to tell needs a lot of cover<br>
overhead to make it home.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; aren't that competent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;US military personnel are not your regular government employees.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's true, but we are talking about the military *plus* other government</i><br>
<i>&gt; agencies.  I am hardly convinced that Bill Clinton loves, respects, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; would protect the U.S. military.  </i><br>
<p>
But he loves himself and his own power far more than the Constitution.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact, I can see a motivation for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Clinton to nail the military.</i><br>
<p>
If word got out right before the election that a navy missile shot down<br>
one of our own airplanes full of people, with all the other examples of<br>
either corruption or incompetence in this White House, his approval<br>
rating would have gone into the shitter, and Dole would have had a field<br>
day.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;experienced. What is left?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The fact that it is Navy vessels collecting the debris is like letting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;crime suspect examine and collect the evidence at a crime scene.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That could be.  But it contradicts your theory that only a small part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the destroyer crew ever knew.  This would mean several ships are now in on</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.</i><br>
<p>
It would mean only a few knew of the missile being fired. Likewise, only<br>
a few members of a salvage crew ever see the debris recovered, and<br>
incriminating pieces could easily be tagged underwater with transponders<br>
to be picked up by sub. Sub based salvage operations have been conducted<br>
by the Navy in the past, including the recovery of a whole Soviet<br>
submarine. Never heard about that, did you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Skeptics are people who demand truth and proof.  That's your definition --</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I agree with it.</i><br>
<p>
So when are you going to demand the truth about the crash?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The issue here isn't whether you are skeptical and I am not.  To me, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue is that some people are suggesting that since the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes lies (which it does), it always lies (which it does not).</i><br>
<p>
Yet if someone you knew lied to you half the time, wouldn't you only<br>
believe 50% of what they say?  50% is enough to suspect someone, even<br>
enough to bring criminal charges against someone in court or convene a<br>
grand jury.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't say you are wrong to doubt the official investigation, I say I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; also not wrong to doubt the conspiracy theories.  The fact is, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy theories are based on selective reading of what are at bottom</i><br>
<i>&gt; just more press reports.</i><br>
<p>
And the commonly accepted views of events operate the same way. The<br>
"winners" in history pick a story that is believeable, and find the<br>
facts to fit. ANything else is dismissed as wacko.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So it comes down to what we know and don't know.  We know 100+ people</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe they saw a missile.  We know eyewitnesses at night can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; unreliable.  However, even if we decide they really did see a missile --</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I do not consider unreasonable -- I have heard no "facts" that prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; it was fired by a US Navy ship.</i><br>
<p>
The Captains log has not been released to the public, and has been<br>
classfied. Until it is released, a suspect is still out there.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't argue *both* that the US Navy can keep anything quiet they want</i><br>
<i>&gt; *and* that you or others know it was the Navy -- unless there is objective</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof like photographs of the ship firing the missile, US Navy missile</i><br>
<i>&gt; debris washed ashore, or whatever.  Otherwise, how did you find out what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are so good at concealing?</i><br>
<p>
Witnesses and the public statement of a DEMOCRAT who has long experience<br>
in White House and other high level government business. 157 eye<br>
witnesses corroborating each other is a much bigger statistical lump to<br>
dismiss than just a few confused reports. If facts are not true, they<br>
typically are widely varied in being described by witnesses. When they<br>
all agree, that typically means that is accceptable as a fact.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I recognize the US Navy missile theory is in many ways more attractive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; exciting.  Arguments like "here's what really happened" and "you are being</i><br>
<i>&gt; lied to" and "we know the true story because we have pieced it together"</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not based in fact, however.</i><br>
<p>
Yet people are condemned to the death chamber on less every day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We know that terrorists have been targeting US passenger planes.  We know</i><br>
<i>&gt; there have been some Islamic fundamentalists arrested and convicted in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; New York City area who have vowed to take revenge.  So I lean towards the</i><br>
<i>&gt; terrorist theory.</i><br>
<p>
Yet where is the bomb residue?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I am not mad at anyone for leaning in other directions.  For me, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't about which theory wins or loses, this is about finding out what</i><br>
<i>&gt; really happened.</i><br>
<p>
A good investigator does not take someone off a suspect list simply<br>
because they say "I didn't do it".  Anyone with means and opportunity<br>
should be pursued to the fullest extent of the law, even if they are the<br>
law, and especially so if that is the case.<br>
