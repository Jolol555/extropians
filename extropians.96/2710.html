I'm not at all sure what you mean here.  The concepts stimulated in my<br>
mind, which may or may not be what you had in mind, is that Vinge's<br>
Powers are explicitly somewhat de-mystified.  Transcendance isn't a<br>
mysterious disappearance, a la _Marooned in Realtime_.  It's having a<br>
really big brain and being able to construct sentients to order and<br>
having loyal nanomold.  The Gods don't have strange powers beyond our<br>
ken; they're like us, except much better.<br>

Well yes, they don't have telekinesis.  To move something they have to<br>
do some action to move something.  This is what I _liked_ -- the Powers<br>
don't manipulate matter through direct consciousness; they have tools,<br>
like us.  That's why it is harder SF.<br>
<p>
And I don't see what Countermeasure is more of a crutch than FTL.  It's<br>
a flexible nano-thingy, which could probably construct jump vanes if<br>
programmed to.  It does something Zonal instead, befitting an object<br>
from the High Transcend.<br>
<p>
I suspect I haven't grasped what you meant.<br>
