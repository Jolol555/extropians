IAN: Good point, the defense could call in people to testify until the <br>
end of time and thus stop his client from going to the electric chair.<br>
<p>
Of course, the meta issue regarding time is that a huge amount of court<br>
time is devoted to the enforcement of unjust laws -- laws that prohibit<br>
consensual activity -- at a great cost to society. If we had a libertarian<br>
situation, 90% of current 'court time' would be freed up to cases involving<br>
violence and property violations.<br>

Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)<br>
<p>
Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A<br>
