Isn't this the same technology enabling a NAVSTAR GPS receiver to sift <br>
through several simultaneous sat signals? (in contrast to GLONASS, which is <br>
conventional). Where's the novelty of the CDMA approach, can you disclose <br>
a bit more details? Sounds really intriguing, but achieving the same <br>
signal ratio must involve a feedback loop, to dynamically adjust the <br>
sender power. What the highest possible talker load on a single <br>
frequency? Some 10, some 100? 'twould be interesting to learn. The stuff <br>
operates in GHz range, I presume? Individual channel bandwidth???<br>
<p>
Lots of questions, I know...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To the CDMA engineer, this means designing a radio network in which the</i><br>
<i>&gt; base stations must control the transmit power of every handset to within an</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely fine tolerance -- no easy thing to do since signals received from</i><br>
<i>&gt; mobile handsets naturally vary more than ten thousand-fold due to fading</i><br>
<i>&gt; and multipath interference (i.e., signals taking different paths and</i><br>
<i>&gt; recombining at the receiver out-of-phase).</i><br>
<p>
Ah, so they have an autofeedback control loop allright...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; However, if one can make power control work it delivers significant</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantages to the end-user.  Since the handset is continually compensating</i><br>
<i>&gt; for fading by adjusting its transmit power -- thousands of times each</i><br>
<i>&gt; second -- the hissing and fluttering sound normally associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt; cellular telephone completely vanishes.  CDMA phones sound very much like</i><br>
<p>
Uh, I thought the cellular stuff was digital? The only artefacts being voice <br>
compression alias?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; desktop phones; some people will refuse to believe you are calling them</i><br>
<i>&gt; from your car.  And there is another beneficial side-effect of granular</i><br>
<i>&gt; power control: it greatly extends handset battery life.</i><br>
<p>
An vanilla cell phone in Europe has about 5 W peak power. What does CDMA <br>
average about to? Does this result in nondeterministic battery life time, <br>
depending on your movement dynamics and EM environment?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, I now have one of these CDMA personal communication phones in hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it does work.  Sound quality is excellent.  Due to its enhanced battery</i><br>
<i>&gt; life, you can leave the phone on all day.  (Actually, it can be left in</i><br>
<p>
The usual good cell stuff has a standby of max 50 hours, I thought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; standby for two days, or you can talk for four hours, or some combination</i><br>
<p>
4 hours? It's not too sensational.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; inbetween.)  Initial prices are 10% - 15% less than cellular telephone.</i><br>
<p>
Ah. That's an argument. Hardware prices, what about provider prices?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, CDMA claims ten times the capacity of conventional cellular, so</i><br>
<p>
Wowie. Ten times 9.6 kBaud???<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; prices will probably go much lower as competition heats up.  It is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy to provide features like caller ID over an end-to-end digital network,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so they are part of the standard package.  Some of the conspiracy theorists</i><br>
<i>&gt; are now buying time for themselves by focusing on CDMA's capacity claims,</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying the technology will blow up in operators' faces *later* -- as they</i><br>
<i>&gt; bring more subscribers online.</i><br>
<p>
But CDMA must be just cellular, with a (big) plus. They sure modeled <br>
expected user load, this must be a bogus argument.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In this case, the "conspiracy theory" is really just the predictable</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaction of the radio communication industry's equivalent of The Flat Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; Society.  It is peddled mainly by old-guard engineers (plus a couple of</i><br>
<i>&gt; well-known Stanford professors) who simply can't accept the shift from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; separate-frequency to a same-frequency paradigm.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is also much progress being made toward accessing the Net via</i><br>
<i>&gt; wireless phones.  AT&amp;T is now selling a product called "PocketNet Phone"</i><br>
<i>&gt; that retrieves intelligently-filtered text from Web pages.  Nokia has</i><br>
<i>&gt; introduced a phone with a somewhat larger screen and built-in Web browser.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I've seen it. A flat box looking a plain cellphone, you open it up <br>
like an oyster and see a diminuitive qwerty and a graphical LCD. I think <br>
they're using ARM chips. Btw ARM, have a look at StrongARM (at DEC site), <br>
it will be part of the next Newton, and some other products.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If there is interest, perhaps I can post more on this later...</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, please do. Most extropians like tech things, methinks ;)<br>
<p>
Check out the Motorola website (must be <a href="http://www.motorola.com">http://www.motorola.com</a>), they've <br>
progressed quite far Iridium-wise (which is just planetwide satellite <br>
cellular), now they're trying to launch a Internet-thru-space project, a <br>
number with direct line-of-sight intersat links (wasn't Billie up to <br>
something similiar?). It will have some ground-located infrastructure as <br>
well, and targeted to cost about 5 G$, or so. I forgot exact details, <br>
check out the site.<br>
