On Tuesday, October 8, 1996, Suresh Naidu wrote several things which I have <br>
questions about.  His statements are in quotes, and my questions and  comments <br>
(mostly comments) follow each quote:<br>
<p>
"My point is that competition cannot help worker conditions, nor can it <br>
eliminate the authoritarian nature of business."<br>
<p>
	Why can't competition help worker conditions?  A worker is someone with a <br>
commodity to sell, namely, their labor.  The factory owner or any other <br>
employer is in the market for labor; they wish to purchase labor.  Just as you <br>
would likely buy a product for the lowest price possible, the employer will <br>
look for people who will sell their labor for the lowest price that gives the <br>
employer the highest quality of work they can get for that price.  So there is <br>
a competition among the workers to see who can provide the highest quality <br>
labor at the lowest price, just as there is a competition between businesses <br>
to provide the highest quality products at the lowest price.  <br>
	But there are a limited number of workers, especially workers who perform <br>
high quality labor.  So there is a competition among employers to attract the <br>
high quality workers to work for them, rather than someone else.  So, they <br>
offer higher wages then their competitors, to attract the better workers.  <br>
Thus, the competition between workers holds their wages down, while the <br>
competition between employers for high quality labor tends to raise the wages. <br>
 But, of course, only the workers who are willing to train themselves to <br>
perform high-quality labor will benefit from this competition between <br>
employers.  <br>
	So, you're right, I suppose; workers who produce shoddy work will not benefit <br>
from competition, just as businesses who produce shoddy products will not <br>
benefit from competition.  But, and this is very important, people who take <br>
the time and effort to develop their skills and talents, to better themselves <br>
and produce high-quality labor and products, WILL benefit from competition.  <br>
People will tend to purchase the products and labor that they offer, rather <br>
than from someone else.  I don't imagine that you deliberately buy inferior <br>
products at nearly the same price as much higher-quality products.  Nor do I <br>
think you would hire some slothful, sloppy worker who charged as much as a <br>
very skilled, energetic worker.  It is because humans demand quality that the <br>
system you bemoan exists. And it is because humans demand quality that we <br>
progress at all.<br>
	Remember that our ancestors had little more than rocks, sticks, dirt and <br>
other plants and animals to use.  This was all they had available to them, <br>
until innovative people started using those resources to create something <br>
better for themselves.  All our technology and wealth, beyond what our distant <br>
ancestors had, exists because humans created it.  Don't expect that workers <br>
will have any thing more than our ancestors did, unless they earn it.  They <br>
must put forth the effort and create their own wealth, they can't expect that <br>
those who do create wealth are going to just share it with them.  They need to <br>
provide competitive labor and products, just like all the people who built <br>
this great enterprise of Civilization have done.  <br>
	Civilization was not built by slackers who moaned about the unfairness of the <br>
world.  It was built by people who were willing to improve themselves and <br>
provide better services and products than others could.  It was built by <br>
people who were willing to put themselves in competition with others, to see <br>
who could provide the best work and products, by people continually building <br>
the self-discipline to compete successfully.  If some people aren't willing to <br>
do this, then they don't deserve any more than our ancestors had, because if <br>
our ancestors hadn't done all the work they did, they would never have had all <br>
the wealth they created.  If people aren't up to the competition, then maybe <br>
you could throw them scraps from the table of success, but to sit around that <br>
table they must pull themselves off the floor, with their own effort and their <br>
own self-discipline.  They must earn the right to sit around the table and <br>
enjoy wealth with the others who have earned the right to it.<br>
	The Capitalist System is not some sort of magic milk machine with teats <br>
sticking out all over for every freeloader to suck on.  It was never meant to <br>
take care of anyone.  The Capitalist System arises because people have things <br>
they want to sell to each other.  One person may build good huts while another <br>
is good at hunting or growing food, so they make an agreement with each other <br>
to exchange services.  That is all it is.  It is simply people trading what <br>
they have for something else they want.  People sell to the highest bidder and <br>
buy things for as little as possible.  To profit from this system of trading, <br>
you must  be competitive with the others engaged in it.  Those who can't be <br>
competitive simply won't find people who are willing to make an agreement to <br>
trade with them.  And there is no reason to expect that anyone *should* trade <br>
with them, if what they offer is much worse than what others offer.  You <br>
wouldn't buy rotten apples from someone when the person next to them is <br>
selling fresh apples for nearly the same price.<br>
	The Capitalist System cannot be expected to save Humanity, especially not <br>
from it's own stupidity and laziness.  These are just the hard facts of <br>
reality.  People won't buy inferior products, when better ones are as <br>
available.  Therefore, only the people who can provide better products <br>
(including labor) than others will be able to secure a trade with others for <br>
what they have to offer.  People have to look out for themselves in this <br>
world; they can't expect others to just take care of them, especially if they <br>
have little to offer in return.<br>
	Yes, there is a great deal of "unfairness" within reality.  But that is <br>
simply a result of reality not being uniform.  Reality will never be fair; all <br>
we can do is just do the best we can with the resources we have available to <br>
us.  This has always been true, even before humans evolved.<br>
	<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
"What I propose is this:Anarcho-syndicalism, as advocated by Rudolf <br>
Rocker and Noam Chomsky, souped up into a hi-tech version by yours truly. <br>
Private property is abolished, as the only way to hold <br>
private property is by right of force, and since there is no need for a <br>
government to keep people in check, that would be abolished as well. Most <br>
crime comes from poverty, and the rest can easily be dealt  with by <br>
citizens.  Okay, ask me questions."<br>
...<br>
"equal access to resources <br>
to do with as you will, provided it doesn't harm <br>
anyone else's access or human rights. This needs <br>
some elaboration, which I will provide if asked."<br>
<p>
	Are you serious about abolishing private property?  Do you think everyone has <br>
a right to the work of others?  Lets say I spend a great deal of time and <br>
energy building a house to live in.  Since you are advocating abolishing <br>
private property, this would mean that after all my work, I most likely <br>
wouldn't even get to sleep in the house since there are so many people out <br>
there who would just love to sleep in my house for me.  People who don't want <br>
to build their own houses would just wait for others to build houses and then <br>
just move in when they're done.  The builders of the houses would never get a <br>
place of their own, they would realize that continuing to build houses was <br>
futile, since they'd never get to live in one, unless they forcefully kept <br>
others from invading their work.<br>
	Or what about a farmer?  They spend long hours each day tending their fields. <br>
 Are you really suggesting that everyone else should be allowed to just come <br>
in like a swarm of locusts and take that food and not give the farmer anything <br>
in return?  If so, then why would people want to farm?  They could just let <br>
other people do it and then take the food from them when it's ready.<br>
	What sort of resources are you suggesting we allow everyone equal access to?  <br>
My computer is a resource which I spent many months paying for with my labor.  <br>
Are you suggesting I invite the whole neighborhood over to use it?  When would <br>
I get a chance?  If everyone is supposed to have equal access to every <br>
resource, then it would be very difficult to make anything.  If someone was <br>
making a pot out of clay, for example, then the clay they're using is fair <br>
game for anyone else to come along and take from them, since it's a resource, <br>
even if they're in the middle of using it to make the pot.  Are you *really* <br>
suggesting that they allow people to just take their work from them, rather <br>
than block equal access to resources?<br>
	<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
"Unless (gasp) the workers ran the mill themselves.  Operating a mill <br>
better tends to mean "how much wages can I take away without reducing the <br>
output of my workers. "<br>
<p>
	If the workers really *can* run the mill themselves, then why don't they get <br>
together and decide to do just that?  Why can't a group of people all agree <br>
together to run a business?  Most likely, the workers are not competent to run <br>
the mill themselves or are not capable of working together effectively enough <br>
to run a mill that can compete with other ones.  If it was more profitable to <br>
run a mill where every worker runs the thing together, on equal footing, then <br>
it would out-compete the ones which don't use this strategy.  <br>
	By the way, an increasing number of businesses are realizing that they do <br>
better when the employees have feedback into how the business is run, and <br>
they're using strategies such as profit-sharing to give their employees a real <br>
interest in helping the company do better.  If these ways of doing business <br>
are more profitable than other ways, then eventually, there *will* be <br>
businesses that are run by the workers.<br>
<p>
	Suresh, I know you haven't explained your ideas in any detail, so I don't <br>
wish to attack them, since I'm unclear on what they really are.  But what <br>
you've given so far, about not allowing private property and allowing equal <br>
access to resources doesn't make any sense to me, for the reasons I indicated <br>
above.  Please explain your ideas in more detail; put them forth into the <br>
memetic competition, and let them be tested.  Give us equal access to the <br>
resources of your mind and stop hoarding your ideas from us, after all you <br>
don't own your own mind, that would be private property. :-)<br>
