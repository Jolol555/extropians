<i>&gt;What could a creature "with little or no grey matter" do that a machine </i><br>
<i>&gt;or AI could not do faster and cheaper?  It appears to me that the only </i><br>
<i>&gt;reason to build any tool is to get the job done quicker, cheaper and more </i><br>
<i>&gt;thouroughly than the old tool.  Why assign tasks to a new tool that is </i><br>
<i>&gt;inferior to the one it replaces.  By the time a race of humaniod drones </i><br>
<i>&gt;hit the market, AI should already have a considerable marketshare of </i><br>
<i>&gt;brainless labor. , Machines already out perform humans, horses and oxen </i><br>
<i>&gt;at many brainless tasks, and better machines will(be able) to out perform </i><br>
<i>&gt;them in the remaining drudgeries.</i><br>
<p>
Lets face it, robots will never be doing tasks such as house-cleaning,<br>
building construction, interior or exterior decorating, etc. because they're<br>
too clunky and not as flexible as flesh and bone the only potential<br>
replacement I can think of is nanites or robots consisting of nanites. They<br>
can't even climb stairs with much ease which is why they invented the<br>
webblimp to fly over the terrain and skip the obstacle altogether.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A big question is how much will it cost to maintain a drone work force.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sure that genetic engineers could make more efficient organisms than </i><br>
<i>&gt;those currently available, but they'll still need food and waste </i><br>
<i>&gt;removal.  Who will provide the mindless service of feeding and clean up </i><br>
<i>&gt;after the drones-- machines, humans, or more drones?</i><br>
We could make them programmed to use toilets and to go to a dispensor where<br>
they hit a button to drop food into a slot. This whole idea sounds sorta<br>
creepy but would be commonplace eventually.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Moral Question: How is bulding an race of drones in a laboratory for </i><br>
<i>&gt;labor different from just building designer humans to perform those same </i><br>
<i>&gt;tasks?  Would these humans be created or enslaved?</i><br>
I personally believe that in order for a race to be considered enslaved it<br>
needs to be able to think on it's own in a philosophical manner such as "why<br>
do i exist?". Anything other than that is free for us to utilize.<br>
