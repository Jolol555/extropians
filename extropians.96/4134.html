<i>&gt;  I didn't realize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there was any semblence of 'constructed gender differences' on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list; if such is true, then I truly don't understand what these differences</i><br>
<i>&gt; are.  Perhaps that is your point.  As for overcoming such possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences, I think a dose of *reality* would do the trick.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	Perhaps we do not assume that someone merely conforms to societally <br>
constructed differences, but rather come to  a set of assumptions about <br>
someone's attitudes towards their societally constructed role.  For example, <br>
it is too easy to assume that a woman who has rejected some aspect or another <br>
of the role that society has offered her has rejected all aspects of what is <br>
considered feminine.    <br>
	In truth each of us has a complicated relationship to the<br>
roles constructed for our gender, race, etc.  I'll take myself as an example.<br>
Consider two things that make up key parts of the roles society constructs for<br>
the genders:  what is done with recreation time and roles in interpersonal <br>
relationships.  As for recreation, I like doing many "guy" things, like <br>
watching the Yankees play the Mariners, or sitting on a bass boat for endless <br>
hours in the bitter cold, and other such inanity. (or insanity, if you <br>
prefer.) But when it comes to the realm of interpersonal relationships I <br>
prefer the more passive role that our society has traditionally deemed <br>
feminine.<br>
	Eliezer appears to have rejected some aspects of youthful masculinity.<br>
What else can we automatically conclude from this, that is not on the surface?<br>
Alas, nothing.<br>
