&lt;&lt; You say the natural relationship between humans is trade. I say it's<br>
cooperation. I<br>
 think our ability to cooperate was vital to our evolutionary<br>
 success. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Trade IS cooperation.  You want something I have and I want something you<br>
have.  Neither needs what we currently have as much as the thing the other<br>
has.  So, we trade.  Win-Win.  One-on-one cooperation.  <br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;Only when a small minority obtain power through generally nasty means, can<br>
 they tell everybody else that these are the rules they must follow. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Non-cooperation with a small controlling group (government or industry) is<br>
how India got the British out.  The Indian population would not "do business"<br>
with the Win-Lose British government.   This is NOT a problem of capitalism.<br>
 It is the freedom you have with capitalism.  You are free to choose.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  I hate and fear government just as much as you do. But I also<br>
 hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their<br>
 advertising and poison my water with their pollution. Uggh, there must be<br>
 a better way than unrestrained capitalism.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Then why do business with them?  You are free to choose.  <br>
You are confusing ALL of capitalism with the few Win-Lose companies.  <br>
<p>
You are blind to the Win-Win business deal --- main reason for repeat<br>
business in capitalist trading (and cooperation of any kind.)  The repeat<br>
business is the ONLY way ANY company can stay in business because a company<br>
has no guns and prisons to punish me if I don't by their product.<br>
<p>
I can't understand why a business is so fearful to you.  They don't have<br>
guns, or police, or armies,  or prisons.  They will not come to your house at<br>
3 AM to arrest you for not buying an IBM computer or using MCI instead of<br>
AT&amp;T.  <br>
<p>
The government grounds out all competition. How many competing governments do<br>
we have to choose from?  Not many.   People crash through the gates to get<br>
into capitalist countries,  you _never_ see that with communist or<br>
fascist-socialist countries.  <br>
<p>
Businesses on the other hand are in competition with dozens of other<br>
companies everyday on a world wide basis.   Are you talking about win-lose<br>
monopolies?  Only then would I partly agree with you. (They still don't have<br>
prisons and police).  <br>
<p>
But, even monopolies can't force you to buy unless their product can't be<br>
purchased through other means, the black market, and it has to be a product<br>
extremely important to life.  Healthcare mergers (monopolies, HMOs) are not a<br>
good deal for the patient in my opinion.  Even then smaller companies start<br>
up to compleat for healthcare markets.  A friend of mine started one up last<br>
month because the "big boys" got too expensive. <br>
