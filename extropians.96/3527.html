Gotta give you credit for trying -- it's "kaffeeklatsch" (no,<br>
I didn't have to look it up).  BTW, that's what it seems to me<br>
to be most of the time, but I'm fine with that.  I have a "D"<br>
key for when it gets too deep (either philosophically,<br>
technically, or rhetorically).  I can certainly see how anybody<br>
who's on more than one mailing list with such volume might be<br>
more picky, though.<br>
<p>
Having done what I think I can for Eliezer for the nonce (read,<br>
until I see a sample letter), and having nothing intelligent to<br>
say about vector analysis or conservation of energy/momentum, I<br>
think I'll go back to semi-lurker status for a while.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
