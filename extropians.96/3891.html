You asked:<br>
&lt;Are you implying that a more biological/environmental approach to <br>
transhumanism in general would be a path that ultimately leads to <br>
stagnation ?&gt;<br>
<p>
NO, not at all!<br>
I definitely feel that "a more biological/environmental approach" MUST <br>
be part of transhumanism in order to complement the mechanical and <br>
directed-design approaches that are often emphasized.<br>
<p>
As you say:<br>
&lt;I can just as easily imagine a robot society just 'reproducing' <br>
itself with the only goal of 'spreading' or replicating, than a <br>
combined biological/technological posthuman culture.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is exactly the point I wanted to bring out.<br>
<p>
I just happened to recall Ryman's _Child Garden_ in the context of <br>
human photosynthesis and, when I looked back through the book, thought <br>
it was ironic that *even* a society based on the advanced organic <br>
approaches described could end up somewhat stagnant.<br>
<p>
I think you identify the reason why when you say:<br>
&lt;I don't think it has much to do with a technological path chosen, but <br>
more with the cultural goals of such a society.&gt;<br>
<p>
Thanks for your comments,<br>
Mark<br>
<p>
P.S. There was another hook in there which no one bit at.  I'm sort of <br>
glad because then I'd have to take the time to struggle with that fish <br>
(and it's a big one!)<br>
