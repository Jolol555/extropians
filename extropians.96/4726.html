<i>&gt; There are some "drawbacks" from this discipline, though.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember when you became an atheist?  It was probably pretty </i><br>
<i>&gt; traumatic for you, dropping a  belief system like that (I know it was </i><br>
<i>&gt; for me, anyway).  Imagine going through something as shattering </i><br>
<i>&gt; as that on a monthly or weekly basis...  That's the kind of shit that </i><br>
<i>&gt; happens all the time now that I've trained myself to pay such </i><br>
<i>&gt; deep attention to things.  I see through my current layers of </i><br>
<i>&gt; belief systems so quickly that I'm almost perpetually in a state of </i><br>
<i>&gt; extreme upset.  </i><br>
<p>
David, I just went back and reread all your posts for November and <br>
December.  They all seem to have been written by the same person.  <br>
If somebody gave me a file of unlabeled extropian posts, it wouldn't be <br>
hard to sort them out into David Musick posts, Low Willow posts, <br>
Chris Hind posts, Mr. Singularity posts, etc.  Your style is as consistent <br>
as anybody else's.  Actually there are a couple of exceptions to this -- <br>
your December 10 post about privacy could have been written by <br>
any number of people on the list, and your December 22 post about <br>
The Second American Civil War is not your usual style.  But those are <br>
the only exceptions.  <br>
<p>
If you have been through a change as traumatic as the shift from theism <br>
to atheism in the last month, it doesn't show.  Can you give an example <br>
of a major belief system that has changed in the last few weeks, or even <br>
the last few months?  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
