I agree with Greg that we shouldn't have to say these things. Racism should<br>
be so obviously ludicrous to someone who wants individuals to control their<br>
biology and transform themselves that it's not an issue.<br>
<p>
However, should an anti-racism statement be added to the Principles? I doubt<br>
it. The Principles provide a condensed statement of the things extropians<br>
are *for*, not a long list of the things we are *against* or find silly.<br>
I've tried to stick to this positive focus increasingly closely in<br>
successive versions. The overdue version 3.0 will continue that tendency.<br>
<p>
Although the Principles may not be the place for an anti-racism statement or<br>
a statement eschewing violence, we can certainly say these things in<br>
discussions and interviews, and I have done so.<br>
<p>
Another reason I resist putting such statements in the Principles is that I<br>
want to keep them concise. Making these statements *accurately* would<br>
require qualifications and discussion. For example, one might dislike<br>
certain *typical* (but not essential) characteristics of a culture, and it<br>
*might* be that this culture is almost completely coterminus with a racial<br>
group (identified by some physical features). A *defeasible* suspicion of<br>
people of this culture/race based on these characteristics might sometimes<br>
be reasonable. In the same way, a statement against political violence would<br>
need subtle qualifications about self-defense, special conditions, etc.<br>
