Erm, you got this wrong. I was not talking about front-user costs. Just <br>
infrastructure-associated costs, which is a heavily free-market modulated <br>
subset of the former.<br>
<p>

<p>
I was referring both to current infrastructure, but mostly to near-future <br>
infrastructure, which will be _extremely_ dear. Forbiddingly so. <br>
Compacting cities is basically the only way how we can afford such <br>
infrastructure, mature nanotech not taking into account ;)<br>
<p>
That the need to counteract infrastructure deterioration, new <br>
installations set apart, imposes a major drain upon the pocket of most <br>
large cities is not open do doubt. Alone costs for Teutonic road <br>
maintenance are atrocious, and I think U.S. has much higher costs due to <br>
lower average population density. At a guess, multidigit Gbuck values?<br>
Plus, moving heaps of processed iron by means of obsolescent ICU engines, <br>
producing traffic jams and casualties en masse. This is sure sustainable <br>
future technology.<br>
<p>
Moreover, wholly different effects arise once a certain humans/volume <br>
density threshold is reached:<br>
<p>
The drastically better surface/volume ratio allows higher-quality surface <br>
materials to be used, e.g. thin-film photovoltaics on glass. This gives <br>
both power and makes frequent costly repairs unnecessary. (This also <br>
applies to other brands of infrastructure, e.g. as glass/ceramics tubing, <br>
stainless steel pipes, hitech ceramics coating, steel structures, etc).<br>
<p>
There is no weather impact on traffic, since there is no weather. And <br>
traffic is hidden invisibly into channels. Why do we tolerate this number <br>
of car accidents, many of them fatal or crippling? Why?<br>
<p>
There is no need to heat in winter, only to get rid of excess heat, <br>
whatever the season.<br>
<p>
A large cell-local fuelcell (or a natural gas ICU, or whatever) can <br>
produce both power and heat. You can't do heat/energy coupling because of <br>
large distances involved. There are none in HiveCity.<br>
<p>
Rainwater can be cached. Due to it, sewage infrastructure's cheaper, too.<br>
<p>
You don't need to decceleate/accelerate on every crossing, since traffic <br>
routing in matrix buses make this a very rare event. The same <br>
transportation system is utilized both for human traffic and deliveries, <br>
all automagically. Painless: no noise, no exhaust, no need for a human <br>
driver. Hang TV-shopping, but why not buying by telepresence?<br>
<p>
Private (electro/hydrogen) airports can be put onto the upper level. <br>
Parks, solar cells and/or hydroponics facilities can be located there.<br>
<p>
But the basic reason for why we need HiveCity is need for undenaturated <br>
landscape. Suburbia seals landscape, denaturates habitats. I want to be <br>
able to see fresh green after 5 min travel from any part of the city, not <br>
after hours of car travel, which pisses off other city inhabitants. I am <br>
_not_ proposing anyone to turn into human RatMoles or bees, living solely <br>
in windowless cubicles. Of what use are windows if all I see is a sea of <br>
concrete and asphalt?<br>
<p>
However, since windows will be rare, sufficient visual stimuli should <br>
be provided. This can be done by inserting some ecosphere into the tiers, <br>
by ubiquitous beamers or augmented reality. The bugaboo of endless gray <br>
concrete corridors need not to be contemplated, a minumum amount of <br>
inventiveness provided.<br>
<p>
The only minus I am aware of, is the need for photovoltaics panes in <br>
HiveCity's immediate neighbourhood. However, these provide only minimal <br>
shading, so that there is sufficient ambient light below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; space is very large.  Why?  Because so many people want to be there</i><br>
<i>&gt; for their jobs.  Why are the jobs there?  Sure some people need to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; physically present to run those pipes and delivery trucks, but not</i><br>
<p>
Pipes must be present first, and this requires both pipes and <br>
earthworks. Pipes are paid by the meter, earthwork by volume. <br>
(I am assuming infrastructure channels to be present in the MallCity).<br>
Both is not cheap. Pipes corrode, this requires tracking their state and <br>
earthworks, again, if access is required. Proper channel infrastructure <br>
can be implemented only in a HiveCity, both because of planning and costs <br>
attached.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; very many.  It seems it's mainly because companies show a strong</i><br>
<i>&gt; preference for colocating their employees, and locating them near</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppliers and customers, even when the physical cost to ship stuff is</i><br>
<i>&gt; small.  Why?  It seems because people want to meet each in person a lot.</i><br>
<p>
Nevertheless, there is a strong push towards teleworking. Currently, <br>
most teleworkers need to shuttle into main office for 1-2 days a week, <br>
mostly for social/company spirit recalibration reasons. In mature <br>
VR/telepresence there is no need to be physically present, a minimal <br>
fakespace fidelity provided. A a decade from now, you can render a cushy <br>
bureau, filled with avatars, should you wish such a thing.<br>
 <br>
Admittedly, we are still lacking adequate displays and bandwidth channels <br>
for above scenario to become realistic. Assuming hypergrid optical fiber <br>
connectivity, HiveCities win hugely, again.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I suggest you read a bit more urban economics before you so quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt; dismiss this analysis by economics who I'm sure have read quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; a bit of urban economics.</i><br>
<p>
Afair I never implied that a more cost-efficient infrastructure would <br>
make living in cities cheaper. It was not my intention to dismiss <br>
anything, I was just seized by a fit of blue-skyeing. I thought that much <br>
was obvious.<br>
