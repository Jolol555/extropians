We need agoric computing, with ubiquitous WSI nodes (dwelling behind the <br>
walls, linked with cheap thermoplastic fiber optics (attenuation much <br>
higher than glass, but sufficient for short-range links), orthogonal <br>
hypergrid connectivity (redundant links, wiring density decreasing with <br>
distance, though fuzzy would do binary offsets into ID space are best: <br>
catches runtime defects, performs well even in highly defective grids, <br>
derives ID from wiring constraints, purely local-knowledge routing), <br>
lightweight routing (grassrouting)). The infrastructure is installed/owned <br>
by you, so you charge for the routing/computational resources (nanoOS must <br>
have nanocash capability) used by transient packets/agents (all objects). <br>
<p>
You are both a provider, and a consumer, striving to achieve a balanced <br>
account. If you charge too much (infobahn waylayer?), packets will route <br>
by you, so there is a economic pressure for the hardware to become <br>
cheaper/prices to go down. <br>
<p>
If you own a number of meshed nodes, there must be a basic assymmetry <br>
(hardware-supported) catching attempts of exoperversion: a movable <br>
"firewall" (distinction between nodes owned by you/nodes transiently <br>
owned by others). <br>
<p>
If you want to reclaim the resources (say, you'd like to watch webTV, <br>
and need additional horspower for video decrunching), you send all <br>
objects a flush message, then reboot the node from scratch, attaching them <br>
to those currently used by you, load leveler then taking care of the rest.<br>
<p>
&amp;c&amp;c.<br>
<p>
(I hope above minirant made sense).<br>

P.S. BeBox now runs Linux (SMP?). A nanokernel with Linux personality <br>
(not Mach) have been developed in Dresden.<br>
