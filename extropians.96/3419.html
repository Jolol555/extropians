        First off, I'd like to say that I agree with Eliezer and Chris Hind<br>
on most facets of their respective posts.  Right now, I am doing all I can<br>
to spread the memes of extropy and transhumanism.  I disagree with Eliezer's<br>
comment that "I haven't heard anything new on this list that wasn't quoted<br>
from an article."  That is untrue.  Michael Lorrey has had some great ideas<br>
manifested with 'Lorrey Drive'.  Every poem or piece of written artwork that<br>
goes onto this list has the *potential* to go farther.  Many of the poems I<br>
write get published in various places.  I have a music concert centered on<br>
my extropian-esque music and lyrics coming up this weekend.  I am<br>
kineticizing (sp?) my potential.  I encourage everyone else to do the same.<br>
<p>
        The values of spontaneous order seem to have been lost lately.  List<br>
members don't seem to take action upon themselves to make our potential<br>
kinetic.  I can understand the want for the time and situation to be<br>
right...I agree wholeheartedly...but we cannot sit around wallowing in our<br>
own stagnation of potentialities [not insinuating that we all are].<br>
A lot of crap was dished out to Michael Lorrey for his new site (which I<br>
have not yet seen).  I am not a physicist, but I respect Michael greatly for<br>
his ability to *create*, whether or not it works (and I believe it shall!).<br>
<p>
        Another thing that has been irking me a little bit lately is the<br>
view of 'dynamic optimism'.  I am dynamically optimistic, but I am also<br>
realistic.  Dynamic optimism becomes altruism when there is no tact or<br>
reality incorporated.  What I (and Eliezer etc.) have been seeing is wishful<br>
thinking.  "Yeah, such and such will happen at such and such a time."  It's<br>
kind of like a blind faith.  You have to do all you can to *ensure* that<br>
things will happen.  How many extropians have stock in nanotechnology<br>
companies right now?  Space exploration companies?  ANY extropian companies?<br>
It is much better to put all your eggs in one basket if you really want the<br>
eggs to get to the same place at the same time ...see what I mean? &lt;g&gt; <br>
<p>
        Chris Hind said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I may speak for the group as a whole: Take action NOW! Do WHATEVER YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt;CAN!</i><br>
<p>
        I second that.  (Wow!  I'm actually agreeing with Chris for once<br>
:-))  To quote a verse from one of my poems:<br>
<p>
<p>
        I may never reach my goal<br>
        My lunacy might take its toll<br>
        But if perchance I ever die<br>
        At least I had the balls to try<br>
<p>
