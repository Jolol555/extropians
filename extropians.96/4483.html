True, but then this boils down to computational complexity, not our<br>
understanding of computers.  For deterministic problems, a computer can<br>
always come up with a deterministic solution provided we are willing to wait.<br>
<p>
The fact that we are not willing to wait is a personal problem. <br>
It is also the reason I replaced my IBM XT years ago ;-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There have been computers turned loose on problems that were thought to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be non-deterministic, like proving Fermat's theorem. And Viola! after</i><br>
<i>&gt;the N zillionth step they stopped with a solution. Someone probably has</i><br>
<i>&gt;one running right no to prove that no even number greater than 4 is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sum of two primes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
As I stated previously, our real problem isn't in our understanding of<br>
computers, but in our ability to determine whether or not a problem has a<br>
deterministic solution before trying it on a computer.  The length required<br>
to complete a computation is not a problem of the computer design, but of<br>
our unwillingness to wait for the computation to complete. <br>
