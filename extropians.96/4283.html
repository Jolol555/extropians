In a message dated 96-12-17 05:53:41 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The idea of the Internet breaking down, due to an overload of messages,<br>
was <br>
 brought up here.  I began wondering:  if the amount of information the <br>
 Internet can handle at any given time is limited, then won't the price of <br>
 sending a given amount of information through the Internet go up to match<br>
the <br>
 demand for the limited resources?  I don't see how an overload could happen<br>
if <br>
 as the overload threshold was being approached, the price to send messages <br>
 kept rising, thus cutting down on the length of messages people send, since<br>
it <br>
 will cost more to send a longer message.  Is my theory correct? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
It would seem the same thing should work for electrical power but it does<br>
not.  There are still brown outs due to overuse of power.  The price cannot<br>
change fast enough.  <br>
<p>
To apply this specifically to the e-mail situation you have to think about<br>
how much it costs you to send every byte of e-mail.  If you're like me, than<br>
you are paying a set price per month.  I could have my computer 24 hours a<br>
day spewing out snowballs left and right and it would not cost me a penny<br>
more than my monthly fee.  Now, if thousands, or a million people did that,<br>
the net might crash, although I doubt it.<br>
