If one of those people with whom you exchange such things sent you a<br>
cute chain letter which s/he had received, would it annoy you because it<br>
was a chain letter and they were replicating it?<br>

<p>
Are chain letters somehow worse than other junk mail?<br>
<p>

<p>
Isn't any attempt at communication based on that presumption?<br>

<p>
I ask the above questions not to be inflammatory, but out of a sincere<br>
desire to understand. I have run into quite a few people on the net who<br>
share your view of chain mail. I myself am annoyed by _junk mail_. I am<br>
equally annoyed by anything which wastes my time. But I do not<br>
specifically target chain letters for my wrath. On the contrary, the<br>
replication processes by which chain letters survive almost guarantees<br>
that any which I might receive will be of interest to me. Something in<br>
their content has made them work as memetic viruses, and finding out<br>
just what that something is interests me greatly. Likewise, I am<br>
interested in what I perceive to be a growing immunity to them as<br>
expressed by the feelings of yourself and others.<br>
