<i>                &gt;The reason I advocate anarchy is because [...]</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
You're the strangest "anarchist" I've ever seen. Anarchy means no government, <br>
you may be able to dream up a nice euphemism for it, but what you're <br>
advocating has the 2 essential ingredients that make a government a government.<br>
<p>
1) It claims rights and powers individuals do not have. <br>
<p>
2) At any one time in any one place, only one may exist.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;Factories and farms are owned by the community, thus               </i><br>
<i>                &gt;everybody gets a say on what activities the business is                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;doing. No this is not state socialism. It's a business</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
OK, if it's really a business then I can resign from it, and because a <br>
business doesn't claim any rights that individuals don't have, when that <br>
"business" informs me that they don't like the way I'm living my life, I can  <br>
just tell them to go soak their head.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;run democratically, so both the consumers and the workers                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;have input, as to the residents of the area of the factory.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Terrific! The consumers can vote for higher quality, lower prices and less <br>
pollution. The workers can vote for higher wages, more time off, and better  <br>
health care. It's paradise, everybody's happy.<br>
<p>
After that they can vote to change the Laws Of Physics and make gravity <br>
a repulsive force.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Okay. Government regulation is "trying" </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Agreed. Government regulation is very trying.<br>
