<p>
These are excellent comments. It is over 15 years since I have thought deeply<br>
about these things and even more since I worked out a solution to the problem<br>
of the variability of values with focus and emotional state which works for me.<br>
Since I regard the proper role of emotions to be tools of cognition -- a<br>
subconscious instantaneous computation of values, I went through a several<br>
years process of making sure that my emotions were consistent with my reasoning<br>
about my value structure -- of reprogramming my emotions. Since new input<br>
rationally integrated into ones mental data base constantly changes ones<br>
values, I expect this process to continue indefinitely. With respect to the<br>
"survival value" in particular, I believe that it is possible to reprogram<br>
oneself so that does not ever become "a merely incidental background process".<br>
Surely, if it is ones highest value, one should strive to accomplish such an<br>
aim. Because I also find some value in spontaneity and flexibility, I do not<br>
attempt to place rigid, static value relationships on most of what I consider<br>
the less important concerns of my life.<br>

Maybe I'm just being "picky", but I believe that there is a difference between<br>
"If I understand you correctly, this seems to be mystical nonsense." and the<br>
terse "What mystical nonsense." that you wrote.<br>
<p>
The first case allows for misstatement on my part, or misunderstanding on<br>
yours, but the second strongly suggests that my real intended meaning is<br>
mystical nonsense. And when someone suggests that I am capable of intending<br>
such, I believe that I am correct in my assumption that I have been insulted,<br>
whether that person means it to be an insult or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But when you express an idea that I see as mystical, I find no reason not</i><br>
<i>&gt;to attack the idea.  Isn't that what we're here for?</i><br>
<p>
Of course. But it might be a good idea to check the validity of your<br>
understanding of what you have "seen" before "attacking" so vigorously. And<br>
furthermore, why do you need to "attack" at all? There is a vast difference<br>
between polite rational criticism and attack. The former leads to fruitful,<br>
reasonable and thoughtful discourse, the latter often to flames.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Indeed, the very idea that to attack concepts is somehow to personally</i><br>
<i>&gt;insult those who propose them is equally absurd.</i><br>
<p>
Since that was not my idea at all and you have again assumed that it is and<br>
made a very harsh attack, I could also take this as an insult. But now that I<br>
know your style better, I won't :-)<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;Mere biological continuation of metabolism is indeed a prerequisite for</i><br>
<i>&gt;cognition, and therefore values.  Therefore its preservation, as a value,</i><br>
<i>&gt;must indeed compare highly with all others.  But it is still comparable.</i><br>
<p>
There's nothing "mere" about it! However, I grant that it is comparable with<br>
certain others under certain circumstances (see example below).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A slave may know, for example, that there are values attainable with</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom far beyond what he can attain in his present condition.  But if</i><br>
<i>&gt;he values mere biological life incomparably high to those values, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;he will logically not risk his life for freedom, but choose to remain</i><br>
<i>&gt;alive and in chains.</i><br>
<p>
This will all depend on the slavery conditions and the individual slave's value<br>
structure. But I agree, freedom being generally quite essential to a meaningful<br>
life has a direct effect on the value one places on staying alive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 2. I am not prepare to agree that all human values are linearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; comparable. I know *my* hierarchy of values contains incomparable trees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If all human values were comparable, this would imply that everything</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that one values is comparable to a certain amount of money. In essence,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; we would all be "value whores". This is certainly *not* true of me and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; believe that it is not true of *most* people, certainly of most on this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why thank you.  "Whore" is a fine complement.  That is indeed precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I am.  I rent parts of my body to perform functions for the benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt;of others, and they give me money.  In my case, it is my brain and my</i><br>
<i>&gt;hands rather than my genitals, but to attach some judgment to that minor</i><br>
<i>&gt;distinction is just snobbery and irrational moralism.</i><br>
<p>
You do love to apply strident, attacking language, don't you.:-)<br>
<p>
Okay, I will accept that my original word "insane" was grossly mistaken and<br>
pejorative. However, there *does* seem to be a major difference between us<br>
which may not even be open to judgement. Would you trade *any* values you have<br>
(short of your life, of course) for some sum of money?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As you correctly point out, if any two values can be compared, that</i><br>
<i>&gt;implies that all values are assignable a dollar value.  Why do you find</i><br>
<i>&gt;that idea disturbing?</i><br>
<p>
Again, why do you accuse me of finding it "disturbing". I gave no such<br>
indication. I simply find it (for me) wrong!<br>
<p>
For example, if someone said to me "I will give you $X if you let me chop off<br>
your little finger with this meat cleaver", I would not let them do it no<br>
matter what X was. Right now (and at all times in the past) my need for money<br>
has never been so great (largely because I have better ways to gain it) that I<br>
would allow some irreversible disfiguration of any useful part of my body.<br>
However, if I were dying of hunger and thirst in the middle of a desert with no<br>
conceivable means of rescue, and someone who clearly had the means to rescue me<br>
came along and said "I will rescue you and take you to civilization, if you let<br>
me chop off your little finger after we get there", I would have no hesitation<br>
in agreeing and honoring the deal.<br>
<p>
Clearly, ones values of various things depend on ones circumstances. They also<br>
very much depend on the discount rate which one applies to future value versus<br>
present value, but that's a whole other discussion topic.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I find it quite exciting.  Money is a great accomplishment of the mind, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;triumph of reason over mysticism.  The reduction of human values to</i><br>
<i>&gt;manageable, tangible measure, so that human relationships can be defined</i><br>
<i>&gt;by free trade and self-interest instead of force and whim. </i><br>
<p>
This is very true and very elegantly written. Ayn Rand couldn't have done any<br>
better. :) I am not trying to disparage any of this. However, I believe that<br>
many people who are to adamant about this sometimes forget the value of human<br>
interpersonal attributes such as love, honor, loyalty, joy, etc. which are only<br>
very indirectly related to money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If there existed two values that cannot be compared, then it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;not be possible to rationally choose a course of action when they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;in conflict, or even judge the action afterward.</i><br>
<p>
I don't agree with this. Either in a given set of circumstances they would be<br>
incomparable (I always use this in the mathematical sense) and not be capable<br>
of being in conflict, or in another set of circumstances, they would be<br>
comparable and again not in conflict.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't choose to live such an undirected, purposeless life.</i><br>
<p>
Omitting the word "such", neither do I and neither am I doing so.<br>
