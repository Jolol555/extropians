<i>&gt; If I collect some people at random, and show 90% of them a red ball,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while I show 10% of them a green ball, wouldn't you agree that if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are selected, your chances of seeing a red ball are 90%?  Why is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; different if I show 90% of the people I select a double-six dice roll,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while I show 10% a different value?</i><br>
<p>
Your chances of being in a particular group *aren't* *random*.<br>
<p>
A group is 90% red and 10% green.  I roll two dice; if they come up<br>
double-sixes, you're red.  Otherwise, you're green.  Then I assign the<br>
rest of the group at random in a post-hoc distribution.  YOUR chance of<br>
being red is 1 in 36.<br>
<p>
Any particular GROUP has a 1 in 36 chance of being red.  How can a group<br>
with a 1 in 36 chance of redness be composed entirely of people with a<br>
90% chance of redness?<br>
<p>
(How can a post-hoc group with 90% redness be composed of people who had<br>
a 1/36 *chance* of redness?  Because the "chance of redness" does not<br>
equal "redness".  The situation is weird, but it is not impossible like<br>
the one above.  90% of the people were there when a single 1/36 chance<br>
happened to happen, thanks to the experimental setup.)<br>
<p>
At the time of your dice-roll, you have not been selected randomly from<br>
a post-hoc pool of subjects.  90% of the subjects *will* *be* red, and<br>
you have a 1 in 36 chance of being red.  If you are not red, the<br>
experimenter sets up some post-hoc conditions - multiplying the number<br>
of subjects by 10 - to ensure that 90% of the subjects will be red.<br>
<p>
(Incidentally, I tried to present this paradox to certain relatives. <br>
You probably wouldn't believe me if I had a transcript of what they<br>
said.  Highlights of the conversation:<br>
<p>
"Did you say dice or ducks?"<br>
<p>
"Do the ducks roll the dice?"<br>
<p>
"Maybe you could coat the dice with something bad-tasting so the ducks<br>
would spit it out like this:  'PTOO!  PTOO!'"<br>
<p>
"Wait!  Ducks can't count!"<br>
<p>
They aren't senile, just very silly.  If you're wondering how I turned<br>
out the way I did, let's just say my upbringing may have had something<br>
to do with it.)<br>
