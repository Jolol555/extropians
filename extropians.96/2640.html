Well, you may be right, the way things are going.<br>
I had a talk with my cereal this morning...<br>
The cereal community is really concerened because<br>
it is losing it's rich, diverse texture.. Too many cross breedings of cereals<br>
and grains, combined with the<br>
grinding and blending of different cereals together <br>
are causing the cereals to lose their individual<br>
identities. Their flavor, so to speak.<br>
<p>
A new government program is being discussed which<br>
protects the rights of various grains. As cross cereal<br>
issues become more complex, I am sure we will have regulations which ensure<br>
that all cereals are equal.<br>
