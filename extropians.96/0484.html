          I think you have a point there. What I meant was that if <br>
          somebody speaks uncompromisingly objectively, and by doing <br>
          so sometimes utters things which by normal standards are <br>
          repugnant, than I get delighted because I see intellectual <br>
          honesty triumphing over prejudice. I do not mean that the <br>
          ideal communication should positively seek to be <br>
          paradoxical.<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;"Stupid" is a highly emotive word.</i><br>
          <br>
          Exactly. But if we used it as if it weren't, then the <br>
          emotive connotation might wear off.<br>

          <br>
          Yes, that's what I'm concerned about. Transhumanism is weird <br>
          enough anyway; perhaps we should not make it even stranger <br>
          by adopting an offensive jargon.<br>
          <br>
          Now, I am saddened by the reception of my message by some of <br>
          the other people on this list. It's my fault. In order to <br>
          make my point I thought that I should pick an example that <br>
          really was offensive. Well, it seems I succeeded only too <br>
          well. Let me say again, just to make sure that there be no <br>
          misunderstandings: I am NOT a racist. And I do not think we <br>
          should discuss the topic further. My apologies to "Damaged <br>
          Justice", Howard Julien, Pat Hardy and anybody else whom I <br>
          may have misled by my original reply to David Musick.<br>
