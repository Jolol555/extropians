Your statement that the generals in the Drug War don't want to win is<br>
not only paranoid but outright wrong.  Perhaps the politicians at the<br>
top don't want to win, but the lower troops do.  From O'Rourke:<br>
<p>
"If a drug-free America is such a good idea, why aren't members of the<br>
House of Representatives taking drug tests?  Why isn't the U.S. Senate<br>
pissing into jars on C-Span?  "Get serious" is the phrase I heard a<br>
hundred times from cops, DEA men, customs agents and people living in<br>
drug-soaked neighborhoods.  I'd be talking to them and they'd just start<br>
yelling, not at me, but just yelling."<br>
<p>
"Dick Weart, acting director of Public Affairs at Customs, yelled about<br>
the drug destruction of families and social fabric: "This is the way<br>
ancient Rome went down the tubes."  HE SAID THE CUSTOMS SERVICE DID NOT<br>
WANT MORE MONEY OR MANPOWER [emphasis added] - an amazing, unheard-of<br>
thing for a person in government to say.  "We just want people to get<br>
serious," he said.<br>
<p>
I've been convinced that drugs are evil.  I wouldn't continue the<br>
current police-based War on Drugs, not because the means are<br>
unjustified, or because of my Libertarian principles, but because it<br>
doesn't work.  It's not my way in any case - if I go after drugs it will<br>
be with bioengineered viruses, not guns and policemen and warrantless<br>
searches.  Nor would I ever attempt to stop (via force), say, David<br>
Pearce from taking drugs - his ethical system says it's okay, and I<br>
respect that.  But it has to stop.  Have you ever read O'Rourke's<br>
description of a crack neighborhood?  It reads like a description of<br>
Hell.  In fact, as an SF reader, I have to say that there are quite a<br>
few Hells - and not lighthearted ones either - where I would rather be,<br>
as myself, than in a crack neighborhood as a denizen.  Niven and<br>
Pournelle's "Inferno" comes to mind, or the concentration camps of the<br>
Holocaust.  The worst that can happen is that you die a horrible,<br>
painful death.<br>
<p>
I am a human first and a Libertarian second.  Would you, as a<br>
Libertarian, have kept the U.S. out of World War II, knowing that if you<br>
did so the Holocaust would continue and Hitler would rule the world? <br>
Why should your principles as a Libertarian stop at the U.S. border? <br>
Don't the people ruled by dictators have rights too?  Shouldn't they,<br>
too, be protected against their government?  Don't the Libertarian<br>
principles - or any principles, taken to their logical extreme - demand<br>
that one attempt to conquer the world?<br>
<p>
There are laws above morality; they are called ethics.  There are laws<br>
above ethics; they are called "game theory" or the laws of symmetry and<br>
doubt.  Every theory of ethics demands that the user conquer the world<br>
and convert the inhabitants to their own ethical system; it's an<br>
inevitable consequence of the concept of "innocent children".  What<br>
holds you back can only be the conviction that you might be wrong and<br>
that if everyone followed this logic, there would be a major war.<br>
<p>
So my ethical system (and, I admit, my morality) says that drugs are<br>
evil, it says that the crack neighborhoods are evil, and it says that<br>
screaming, abandoned infants born addicted to crack have the same rights<br>
as I do.  I will not strike out with police and guns and force, nor<br>
attempt to turn any human from the path they have chosen with more than<br>
words.  Not because it is not justified - I have no problem with others<br>
doing that, except that it only makes the problem worse - but because it<br>
is not my way.  The problem lies not within any humans but within the<br>
chemicals making up crack and the plants producing cocaine.<br>
<p>
I deny to those plants the right to live; I deny their products the<br>
right to exist.  At them, I will strike.  Some may consider those plants<br>
and chemicals their private property, and I admit that those rights may<br>
be violated.  Imagine a virus which causes the infectee to believe that<br>
the virus is his property, "choose" to spread it, and then kills the<br>
victim.  Is this virus protected by Libertarian principles?  Certainly<br>
if the person is inoculated, his right of private property is violated.<br>
<p>
The Libertarian principles depend on free will.  When people who have<br>
free will but "not enough wisdom to use it" - such as children - become<br>
involved, the Libertarian principles are either modified or abandoned<br>
entirely, depending on the Libertarian.  When a substance such as crack<br>
starts infecting the population, the Libertarian principles cannot<br>
provide a simple solution; they are up against a problem of a higher<br>
order than the principles, one having the ability to modify the<br>
postulates on which the principles depend.  Under the circumstances, I<br>
think that my response - that of obliterating drugs (but not users!)<br>
without coercive force - is restrained, mild, and appropriate.<br>
<p>
It violates the Libertarian principles, but so does crack.  The<br>
substance, in and of its action on the human brain, is a violation of<br>
the Libertarian principles as strong or *stronger* than a mere<br>
bureaucrat telling you what to do, because the government cannot yet<br>
control your mind directly.  Two wrongs don't make a right, but<br>
sometimes coercive force has to be used against criminals or<br>
governmental thugs.  I think that we should estimate the number of<br>
innocent lives destroyed by crack on a yearly basis, divide by fifty,<br>
and call that the acceptable number of civilian casualties to cut drug<br>
use in half.  My plan, which involves no coercive force at all, just a<br>
plague which would affect certain private properties, is as Libertarian<br>
a solution as you're ever going to get.<br>
<p>
Consider crack to be a hostile government equipped with mind control.<br>
