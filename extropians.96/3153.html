The way I've heard it from ornithologists, birds aren't very smart at all.<br>
I believe their intelligence is rated at around the same level as amphibians<br>
(like frogs) and a little better than fish.  Their brains are more like<br>
reactive machinery than a proactive mind.  In this sense, many people<br>
believe birds are not conscious in the sense that mammals are, and do not<br>
have emotional senses of things like pain.  It is more like a complex<br>
machine with some fuzzy logic microcontrollers.<br>
<p>
Actually, "reactive machinery" is a good description of some of the people I<br>
meet...<br>
