The form of the argument  <br>
<p>
The heart of Michael Shermer's argument is to be found on pages <br>
41 - 43 of "Proving the Holocaust."   This is where he illustrates <br>
how "convergence" is supposed to work, by presenting 18 "bits" of <br>
evidence.  <br>
<p>
When Michael presents his 18 bits of evidence, he sets up a dialogue   <br>
in which he presents some evidence, and the revisionists deny it;  <br>
he presents another piece of evidence, and they deny it; and this goes <br>
on and on, with him getting more and more exasperated, and the <br>
revisionists looking more and more foolish, in his eyes at least.  <br>
But what about this witness?  But what about all these other witnesses?  <br>
But what about the Zyklon B?  But what about the missing Jews?  <br>
In this dialogue Michael's imaginary opponent automatically denies <br>
everything -- and gives very lame reasons for his denials -- because     <br>
he is defending his belief system at all costs.  <br>
<p>
The principle seems to be:  If A can put forth 18 bits of evidence for his <br>
thesis, and B denies them all, and A can describe this in such a way that <br>
it appears that B is going to absurd lengths to cling to his belief system, <br>
then A must be right.  To give credit where credit is due, from now on <br>
let's call this "the Shermer principle."  <br>
<p>
Well, Michael:  This form of argument can be used against you.  <br>
Someone who wants to prove the existence of UFOs could proceed <br>
in exactly the same way, casting *you* in the role of the benighted <br>
revisionist.  <br>
<p>
The UFO advocate starts out by listing the types of evidence for UFOs.   <br>
There are hundreds of thousands of documents, letters, government <br>
reports, magazine articles, and newspaper clippings describing UFOs.  <br>
There are many photographs.  There are eyewitnesses from all walks of <br>
life, including many responsible people.  He describes this evidence <br>
in a tone which suggests it is too obvious to argue about; anyone <br>
who doesn't accept it is just out of touch with reality.  Of course, <br>
UFOs exist.  Everybody knows that.  <br>
<p>
Then he presents a witness.  (He has plenty to choose from.  There <br>
must be a million people who have "seen a UFO" at some time.)  <br>
You, the revisionist, say he saw swamp gas.  He presents another <br>
witness.  You say he saw the planet Venus.  Another witness -- you say <br>
this one saw a weather balloon.  Another witness -- Venus again.   <br>
Another witness -- this sighting is a hoax, you say; the witness is <br>
simply lying.   He goes though enough witnesses to create the <br>
impression that you are grasping at straws.  No matter what he says, <br>
you will automatically find some far-fetched "explanation." <br>
<p>
He presents a witness who was abducted.  Here, he says, you have <br>
someone who not only saw a UFO, he was *in* one.  What about him?!  <br>
You say this person is unfortunately deluded.  He comments <br>
mockingly:   "'No one knows why people confess to ridiculous <br>
episodes,' explains the revisionist, 'but they do.' "  <br>
<p>
Then he goes on:  He presents a photograph of a UFO.  It's fake, <br>
you say.  He presents another photograph.  It's fake too, you say.  <br>
A whole collection of photographs.  All fake.  Ah, these revisionists!  <br>
They cling to their belief system no matter what.  But, he goes on:  <br>
what about this picture of a dead alien, being kept in a secret military <br>
base?  It's fake too, you say.  What about President Eisenhower's treaty <br>
with the aliens?  It's fake too, you say, looking more and more <br>
desperate.   <br>
<p>
Now, he says, triumphantly, the revisionist must rationalize no less than <br>
14 different bits of evidence that "jump together" to a specific <br>
conclusion.  But our convergence continues.  If all those people were <br>
not abducted, where did they go?  They are still here, you reply, lamely.  <br>
What about crop circles?  You say the crop circles are hoaxes.  <br>
What about all those pilots who have seen UFOs on their radar?  <br>
Equipment malfunctions sometimes.  What about the mutilated cattle?  <br>
The cattle, you say, were mutilated by coyotes with very sharp teeth.  <br>
Yeah, right, he says.  You've got an answer for everything, don't you?   <br>
Coyotes with sharp teeth!   Very precise coyotes.  <br>
<p>
Post Hoc Rationalization:  We are now up to 18 proofs all converging <br>
toward one conclusion.  The revisionist (you, Michael!) is desperately <br>
swinging away at them all, steadfastly determined not to give up his <br>
belief system...   <br>
<p>
Are you sure you want to admit that this form of argument is valid, <br>
Michael?  <br>
<p>
I could go through this same routine again, and "prove" the existence  <br>
of psi phenomena.  There are many types of evidence.  Witnesses:  any <br>
number of people will testify that they have had psychic experiences   <br>
of some kind.  Physical evidence:  spoons bent by Uri Geller, vases <br>
broken by poltergeists, etc.  Scientific experiments:  several different <br>
kinds of experiments conducted by Rhine, Soal, Tart, and others.  <br>
And so forth.  I could easily come up with  18 bits of evidence for <br>
psi phenomena, and if you found fault with each one,  I could <br>
make it appear that you were grasping at straws.  I could invent a <br>
dialogue in which I am a normal person presenting evidence that <br>
"jumps together" to an obvious conclusion, and you are a fanatic <br>
desperately searching for any explanation, no matter how far-fetched, <br>
to defend your belief system.   <br>
<p>
Does the fact that I could invent such a dialogue imply that <br>
psi phenomena are real?  Obviously not.  <br>
<p>
The thing is, the Shermer principle isn't really supposed to prove <br>
anything.  Its purpose is to distract the reader, to engage him in a <br>
back and forth dialog, to keep his attemtion moving along, so that <br>
he/she won't notice that no conclusion is ever proved.  M.S. never <br>
demonstrates that his 18 bits *imply* anything about gas chambers.  <br>
The concept of implication is entirely missing here.  It has been <br>
replaced by "convergence" or "jumping together."  <br>
<p>
According to M.S, this is how "convergence" works:  First you <br>
construct a picture of the whole thing, the Holocaust -- the menacing <br>
speeches, the trains, the unloading platforms, the gas chambers, <br>
the ovens, the burning pits, the mass graves, the starving prisoners <br>
in the camps at the end of the war.  Then you say that any evidence <br>
for any part of this picture is a "proof" of the whole thing;  and if you <br>
have 18 "proofs," they "converge" to the conclusion that the whole <br>
picture is true.  This is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, except that <br>
it isn't necessary to cover the whole picture.  If you can cover most of <br>
it, the rest "jumps together."  Of course, from a logical point of view <br>
this is nonsense.  <br>
<p>
The "jumping together" phenomenon is how illusionists produce their <br>
illusions.  This is exactly what skeptics are supposed to be skeptical of.  <br>
