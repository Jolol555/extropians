As most entertainment is based on new experiences for the individual,<br>
and that most individuals in a transhuman society would live in a<br>
relative lap of luxury, I would conclude that the most frequently<br>
simulated periods would be the primitive ones, those would induce<br>
hardship of all kinds, most of which have or will have dissapeared from<br>
the "real" human existence.<br>
