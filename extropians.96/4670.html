Chris Hind was saying how we need media hype to get our ideas out and to get <br>
people motivated to do things and that new ideas must be accompanied by a <br>
leader, as a symbol for the 'masses'.  E. Shaun Russell expressed his distaste <br>
for the way certain people here want to spread Extropianism like a cult, and <br>
he disagrees with Chris Hind that good ideas need a leader to represent them <br>
or that we need a lot of media hype to spread our ideas.<br>
<p>
I agree with Shaun.  I didn't get turned on to most of the ideas that <br>
fascinate me so much as the result of media hype or some leader.  I was just a <br>
curious mind, and I explored the world of ideas because it was fascinating to <br>
me.  This is what I want to encourage:  people quietly exploring the ideas <br>
which interest them.  No fanfare.  No media hype.  No leaders.  Just people <br>
pursuing their own interests.<br>
<p>
I have nothing against highly respected people (a.k.a. "leaders); in fact, I <br>
wish to become one myself.  But I believe that people's most influential <br>
leaders should be themselves; that people should look to themselves to decide <br>
what to do with their lives rather than doing what others say they "should" <br>
do.<br>
<p>
The revolution that is occuring right now on this planet in freedom and <br>
independence of thought and the general "waking up" of humanity is a very <br>
quiet revolution.  It's a revolution that takes place within individual <br>
humans, as individuals start realizing that they can take control of their own <br>
lives and become the people they want to be.  It's not something that receives <br>
a lot of media hype, because each time the revolution happens, it only <br>
involves a single person.  People just start waking up and getting their lives <br>
figured out; they start realizing what they want and how to make it.  It's <br>
nothing that is decided by the government leaders, and they actually have very <br>
little influence over the revolution, since they don't have fine-grained <br>
control over every individual's mind.  The revolution is not an organization; <br>
it has no leaders.<br>
<p>
Those who do free themselves to run their minds and lives how they want <br>
certainly have influence on other people; especially people they are close to. <br>
 People see them and see their freedom; they see someone who is not a sheep, <br>
who doesn't respond to things the same way that the flock does.  Some people <br>
are scared to leave the flock and become independent, but many people see the <br>
example of those who do free themselves, and they desire freedom also.  So <br>
they start figuring out how to do it, mostly on their own, learning how to <br>
take responsibility for their own lives, their own decisions, their own <br>
thinking.<br>
<p>
The single most important thing we can do to advance the quiet revolution is <br>
to continue making ourselves more free and powerful.  "Spreading the word" is <br>
not nearly as important as living it.  Freedom is not something that can be <br>
pushed on people or hyped up very much.  People will come to freedom when they <br>
are ready to take charge of their own lives.  Freedom is much more difficult a <br>
lifestyle than the alternative; if it wasn't so tremendously rewarding, there <br>
would be no reason to seek it out.<br>
