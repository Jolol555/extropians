I didn't expect so many followups, with so much emotion, to my<br>
mentioning "one idea I've played with".  Just to be clear, I wasn't<br>
making an official proposal for Extropians.  And I don't have any<br>
great confidence that my idea would work - I'd just like to see some<br>
alternatives tried somewhere somehow on the net.<br>
<p>
It seems clear now that my proposal should not be described as trying<br>
to modify a basic open list.  Rather, the idea would be to "add value"<br>
with another list.  There are many open lists and newsgroups out there<br>
with moderated lists/newsgroups made by someone who picks out what<br>
they see as the good stuff from the open list.  This needn't be seen<br>
as insulting those in the open list, or even insulting those who are<br>
not picked.  Max has on occasion published exceprts from Extropians in<br>
his Extropy magazine, but that shouldn't be seen as insulting everyone<br>
who didn't get picked for exceprts, nor as insulting the Extropians<br>
list.  And if someone wanted to create a "best of extropians"<br>
moderated list, where they only post what they think is the best of<br>
this list, I don't see why that should offend anyone here.<br>
<p>
So, applying my idea to our example, the suggestion would be to create<br>
another list, say "extropians-limited", with its own rules, which<br>
would in no way affect this list.  This other list would start with<br>
say three people, and then accept new posting-members based on a<br>
submission process as I described.  Reading-membership would be open.<br>
Many of you would not ask to join, because you didn't like the elitism<br>
of the concept, or thought it would be too much work to agree to<br>
review submissions.  But would you really be offended by the fact that<br>
other people did want to join such a list?<br>
