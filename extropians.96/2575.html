<i>&gt; I'd say that "commerce is the minimum level of civility with which</i><br>

<p>
Gee and my mother just taught me to be polite, to walk on the outside,<br>
to open doors for women, and not to swear.<br>
<p>
[SNiP]<br>
i'm sorry i don't understand what you're trying to say<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
What a pity--I thought it was clear enough. <br>
<p>
(2) The kind-acting person who runs the candy store may actually like <br>
kids, or not--but if the kind-acting person who runs the candy store <br>
catches a kid stealing, there will be consequences (in my rosy, <br>
Norman Rockwell tinted view, they will be rather limited and will <br>
not include death, dismemberment, lawsuit or jail time). <br>
<p>
Contrariwise, the candystore owner-operator had better not cheat his customers. <br>
<p>
This contrasts with the other relationships mentioned:<br>
commerce is not (1) mother-love, and it's not (3) a life-risking <br>
encounter with a potential exploiter (maybe I should have made (3) <br>
a pimp at the Port Authority instead of a crack dealer).<br>
<p>
How's that for an explanation?<br>
<p>
I place "commerce" with, in part, following the rule "don't cheat <br>
people, it isn't fair."<br>
<p>
 I consider it a "least hypothesis." Perhaps you were never taught <br>
this. It is polite, it has very little to do with walking on the outside, <br>
opening doors for women, and not swearing, as far as I can tell.<br>
<p>
I agree with you that commerce is not all.<br>
