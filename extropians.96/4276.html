<i>&gt; From: Robin Hanson </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd guess the usual reason for trusting such videos is that multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt; independent sources verify the same results.  If you walk naked down a</i><br>
<i>&gt; buzy city street, or assault someone there, enough independent videos</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be taken of you to convince a jury you did it.  </i><br>
<p>
Clips from the same multiple amount of cameras can be edited to show almost<br>
anything you would like. With a little editing it might look like you were<br>
running naked away from a rapist.<br>
Btw. Who's gonna watch all them cameras? There's allready about 5 Billion<br>
cameras out there (eyes), how much do they see? Theres gotta be a LOT more<br>
to cover everything always (forrests, beaches, wastelands...)A single place<br>
unmonitered makes it possible to do unmonitered mischief. With billions of<br>
cameras computers have to analyse images to bring down the datarate. Do we<br>
trust them? Or maybe the images should be stored in every camera?<br>
<p>
How often is there a sporting event where you can't tell on camera if<br>
there's a fault? We'll need a lot of angles to be shure that something is a<br>
rape and not voluntary sex.(most rapevictims don't fight back.)<br>
<p>
Or why not take a lot of video of that obnoxious neighbour. Edit it a<br>
little, and then get rid of him for good?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, there are likely to be some "official" video systems, where</i><br>
<i>&gt; trust is generated by internal checks and balances within the</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations that run them.</i><br>
<p>
Like the TV stations nowadays? Yeah right. They always tell the truth. Or<br>
goverment agencies? How many would you trust to be completely neutral.<br>
