In response to some of Anders Sandberg's ideas about transhuman life <br>
expanding at the speed of light in order to avoid catastrophe, I <br>
speculated that two 'genders' might be needed: "lingering learners" <br>
and "always-pushing-on probes".<br>

&lt;If the probes don't stop, you are placing the task of reproduction of <br>

'smell the flowers'. The only goal of such a culture would be <br>
Expansion, unless you come up with a 3 gender structure, viewing both <br>
the probe and the replicators as 'units' whose sole purpose is to <br>
spread the human/transhuman/posthuman or whatever life form... &gt;<br>
<p>
I was assuming that the probes wouldn't stop but that they would still <br>
be able to take in energy and reproduce, even while on the move.  The <br>
probes would really carry two sets of 'genetic' instructions - one for <br>
themselves and one for the 'seeds' they occasionally scatter to become <br>
lingering colonists in some hospitable part of space.<br>
<p>
Joost added:<br>
&lt;They [the probes] could 'drop off' their gathered knowlegde like <br>
their 'seeds' at every new 'colony' they create, the knowledge could <br>
then be brought back at lower speeds by a fourth type of unit, that <br>
gathers information and spreads it between the colonies, not just <br>
between colonies that were created by the same probe, but far more <br>
efficiently by passing at least one colony of each probe, on its way <br>
back to earth. &gt;<br>
<p>
This is a good idea and would probably require a "3 gender structure". <br>
 I was really thinking that the probes wouldn't gather that much <br>
*knowledge*, except a continually more detailed map of hostile and <br>
hospitable regions of space. Still, this knowledge would be useful for <br>
those colonists who wanted to move on at a slower pace.<br>
<p>
Also, I was thinking that the probes wouldn't be very creative and <br>
would stay fairly static in order to devote their resources to <br>
expansion and preservation of the 'species'.  The problem that I was <br>
really wondering about was how the lingering colonists might provide <br>
updates to the probes and whether this would even be desirable.<br>
<p>
As you say:<br>
&lt;If the probe 'drops' it's latest knowledge at it's last colony, they <br>
can make new probes that include technology based on that new <br>
knowlegde.&gt;<br>
