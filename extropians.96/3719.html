Great to hear you say this Shaun. How about backing it up with a pledge to the<br>
Prometheus Project? ;-)<br>
<p>
I too hope very much not to ever need cryopreservation. Even if suspended<br>
animation is perfected, it will always be more problematic than remaining alive<br>
and in some control of oneself. However, I believe that anti-aging and<br>
rejuvenation is a very hard problem -- much harder than suspended animation --<br>
which is unlikely to be solved within my likely current lifetime (even figuring<br>
another 50 years which I believe that I have a very good chance at with my<br>
present age and state of health). That is why I am working so hard to have<br>
perfected cryonics as a back-up option.<br>
<p>
Again, I appeal to all readers who truly value life, who wish to see and take<br>
part in our potentially glorious future to join me in helping to save all of<br>
our valuable lives so that we may get from here to there.<br>
