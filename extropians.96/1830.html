At 09:02 PM 10/11/96 -0700, John Clark wrote stax of excellently detailed<br>
stuff, and then commented on my following remark:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;Despise bio-evolution if you will, there's something to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;said for letting Vast numbers (Dennett-speak) of variants do</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;the walking through design space...</i><br>
                    <br>
<i>&gt;Yes, it has its uses, and until stone tools came on the scene it was the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;way complex objects could get made.</i><br>
<p>
I'm basing my belief in the superior virtues of stochastic emergent order on<br>
such tales as the following, again from Kelly's OUT OF CONTROL, about the<br>
early days when Tom Ray switched on his Tierra sim and boggled at what he<br>
found coming out of its soup:<br>
<p>
`I started with a creature 80 bytes large... because that's the best I could<br>
come up with...  I let the program run overnight and the next morning there<br>
was a creature - not a parasite, but a fully self-replicating creature -<br>
that was only 22 bytes!  I was completely baffled how a creature could<br>
manage to self-replicate in only 22 instructions without stealing<br>
instructions from others...  To share this novelty, I distributed its basic<br>
algorithm onto the Net.  A computer science student at MIT saw my<br>
explanation, but somehow didn't get [i.e., receive] the code of the 22<br>
creature.  He tried to recreate it by hand, but the best he could do was to<br>
get it to 31 instructions.  He was quite distressed when he found out that I<br>
came up with 22 instructions in my sleep!'  (p. 287)<br>
<p>
It might be countered that Tom Ray, by his own admission, has only just<br>
taught himself programing out of a book, and that ace coders might beat both<br>
man and `beast'.  I think my point remains, however.  A swarm of evolving<br>
competitors on a rugged simulation landscape might get to anywhere you like<br>
faster than a carefully thought-out exploration.  One reason for this, if<br>
Bill Calvin is correct, is that our own brains work (sluggishly) by a quite<br>
similar process of darwin `mechanisms' in contest, so a tasty broth of<br>
alphabet soup run in a supercomputer (a souper-computer?) might always beat<br>
a human programmer.  I'm not sure if AI chess failures disconfirm this, but<br>
then they're run on strict algorithms and lots of look-up tables, neh?  (Has<br>
anyone tried to beat a chess master using a Ray-style chess simulation?  But<br>
maybe the Rooks would run off with the Queen and breed teleporting pawns...)<br>
<p>
Best, Damien<br>
