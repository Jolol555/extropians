I came up with an interesting argument the other day at a party. I was<br>
discussing the reasons that people are swayed by religious beliefs, and<br>
the man I was speaking to (a catholic) became somewhat uncomfortable. I<br>
pointed out to him that his belief in God was irrelevant to the<br>
discussion because the question of God’s existence was irrelevant to the<br>
discussion.  Given that God requires that man except God on faith, one<br>
must have other reasons than proof to believe. What these reasons for<br>
belief might be then would seem to be a legitimate line of inquiry<br>
regardless of the truth or falsehood of Gods existence. <br>
<p>
I said to him, "For the purposes of this discussion, I will grant you<br>
that God exists. Now, is that truth then enough to fully explain peoples<br>
belief in god? Or must there be other reasons? What might they be?"<br>
<p>
His eyes got kind of wide.<br>
<p>
It may have been the first time I actually got a religious person to<br>
question the reasons for their beliefs. I think it was due to the fact<br>
that I started from a position of "Ok, god exists, now what?" That let<br>
me sneak behind his defenses. <br>
