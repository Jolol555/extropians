<i>&gt;&gt;[Suresh Naidu]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a statistic I heard was that 358 people controlled 45% of the worlds wealth.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[Mitchell Porter]</i><br>
<i>&gt;"The number of billionaires in the world has risen from 147 to 447 ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The US's leading billionaires are Bill Gates with $18bn; Warren Buffet,</i><br>
<i>&gt;$15bn; Paul Sacher, $13bn; Lee Shau Kee, $12bn; and Tsai Wanlin, $12bn."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;_West Africa_ lists global GDP for 1993 as $23 trillion. $447 billion</i><br>
<i>&gt;is just under 2% of that, so perhaps we can say that all those</i><br>
<i>&gt;billionaires control at least 1% of the world's wealth.</i><br>
<p>
[me]<br>
$1B each would make $447B, but as we can see, at least 5 of them have more<br>
than $10B.  And the top 5 in the US may not be the top 5 in the world.<br>
I'd say that as a group they *own* maybe 4-5%.  But they may *control* far<br>
more.  For example, Bill Gates doesn't own all of Microsoft, but could be<br>
said to control it.  And the richest people in some countries are their<br>
monarchs, and could be considered to control the entire GDP of those<br>
countries.<br>
<p>
Basically, there isn't necessarily a contradiction between Suresh's and<br>
Mitchells statistics as stated -- it all depends what one means by<br>
"control".<br>
