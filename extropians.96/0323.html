I should have said "unbounded growth"; even with a bound, you can of<br>
course get growth if you asymptote.  And of course I meant growth in<br>
resources used.<br>
<p>
Crosby_M responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Even with our constrained meat minds, many of us still manage to grow wiser </i><br>
<i>&gt;as we grow older, even as we consume fewer material resources.  Is this </i><br>
<i>&gt;because our computational power is growing or because we have learned to </i><br>

<i>&gt;levels?  </i><br>
<p>
No question that you could still "grow" and learn by using a bounded<br>
amount of computational hardware for an unbounded time.  But why not<br>
use more hardware if you can?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I recently quoted from Eric Lerner: "There is no inherent limit to evolution </i><br>
<i>&gt;away from equilibrium, even within a fixed supply of energy, so long as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;process can continually increase the efficiency with which it recycles the </i><br>
<i>&gt;energy."</i><br>
<p>
I have a paper on this topic:  <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/reverse.html">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/reverse.html</a><br>
There are real limits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Regarding option 3, Robin replies: "But some of them should be interested in </i><br>
<i>&gt;our raw mass and the sun's energy.  Unless it is always cheaper to get more </i><br>
<i>&gt;mass/energy by creating a 'baby universe' or some such."  Of course *they* </i><br>
<i>&gt;are *interested* in it; but, if they've transcended then why should they </i><br>
<i>&gt;need to consume more and more material mass? I would think that the most </i><br>
<i>&gt;successful evolutionary step would be to learn to use existing matter, as it </i><br>
<i>&gt;is, as a distributed computing and communications medium. </i><br>
<p>
I don't see what "transending" (whatever that means) has to do with<br>
the basic evolutionary arguments I've offered.  The question isn't<br>
about "needs", its about evolutionary pressures and "wants".  I'm<br>
merely suggesting that if there are accessilbe resources, something<br>
will evolve to use them.  And if there is a use competition between<br>
leave-it-be-nature-watchers and pave-it-over-colonists, its hard to<br>
see how the former would win over most of the universe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, one of Greg Egan's major themes is that transcendant beings might </i><br>
<i>&gt;prefer to run at a slower clock speed.  I know that I would personally </i><br>
<i>&gt;prefer some sort of geologic time frame, being able to watch large scale ...</i><br>
<p>
You'll find it very hard to construct an argument for evolutionary<br>
pressures toward this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think that Boundless Expansion implies explosion. </i><br>
<p>
I didn't mention Boundless Expansion.  <br>
