Don't put all your eggs in one basket. While telepresence is great, it <br>
needs a vehicle (e.g. a blimp), which might need to operate outdoors, where <br>
there are no power grids, etc. I can imagine a mobile insectoid agent, <br>
running on a PEM fuel cell (hydrogen generated in onboard methanol <br>
reformer), using a satellite link to you, wherever you might be.<br>
 <br>
If such agents exist everywhere, you can jump between them, of course. <br>
Who needs Star Trek beamers, if you can simply move about your frame of <br>
reference, basically with the speed of light (accomodate some link <br>
buildup and channel latency).<br>
<p>
Moreover, lots of people will still insist of dragging their bodies <br>
around, if simply to take a swim, and to bask on the beach for a while.<br>
While fidelity of artificial reality can be arbitrarily high, this does <br>
not apply to augmented reality, due to obvious physical constraints.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or hydrogen fuel-based engines.</i><br>
<p>
What is fuel? Burning hydrogen in Carnot machines is quite pointless, <br>
though one should not forget special applications as rockets and hydrogen <br>
turbine jets. Hydrogen fuels cells are the most efficient method to generate <br>
power we are currently know, _the_ best method possible for chemical <br>
power sources.<br>

<p>
And what are means to generate such a hologram, pray? Phase array optics <br>
(which require strong nanotech) excluded, I don't see any possibility <br>
(image generator, computational power) to create animated holograms.<br>
 <br>

<p>
I think it will be a wearable augmented reality, where you are carrying <br>
your computational environment with you. The idea of Au.R. is to create a <br>
Gelernter mirror world, to give you a glamour-like view of the IT<br>
part of reality which is invisible to the naked eye. Take off the magical <br>
glasses, and all you see is a jungle of drab boxes, antennae and a <br>
tangle of glass fibre. Don them again, and a Gibsonian matrix <br>
unfolds around you. Avatars and agents stride ghostlike, you see <br>
data dynamics surging through representations of comm channels. <br>
<p>
After a while, Au. R. will become a richer environment. You'll start <br>
missing things if you plug in too rarely. Apart from wireheads, many <br>
people will work in Au. R -- the step from a mouse pusher, to 6dof cursor <br>
pusher is not too far ;)<br>
<p>
Extrapolate current developments, as head-up VR, wearable, DGPS and LPS, <br>
digital cellular, Internet way into the future -- it all already migrates <br>
towards this Au. R. thingy. It's the logical choice, the next GUI.<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. Mailing for the first time from home, 14400 modem, and not even an <br>
offline mailer (Linux' minicom). Must move to xemacs really soon, don't <br>
see any reasons to make Kraut telecom rich.<br>
