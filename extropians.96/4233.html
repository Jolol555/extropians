I think the concept of speed reading is to think about what one is reading<br>
and why, consider other things one might read or do and adjust your reading<br>
to match the material.  For example if I wanted to learn calculus my best<br>
bet might be to slowly and carefully look over the sorts of problems I could<br>
solve well enough that if I had a problem I could find the section and learn <br>
how to solve it.  I could then see what came up often in my life and work to <br>
be more familiar with those topics.  I could also look for general principals<br>
I could apply often to analogous problems.  All easier said than done.  I<br>
tend to read straight through, afraid I'll miss something, and not remember<br>
that at any give time I am only doing a small fraction of the things I could<br>
be doing and try to pick one of the best ones.<br>
<p>
I might do better to skim every book on the extropian reading list than read<br>
just one if that is all I have time to do.  <br>
<p>
It sounds like you are using reading mostly to stimulate your own ideas but<br>
there are a lot of good ideas out there and sometimes even just hearing a<br>
book title can yield insights.<br>

<i>&gt;Speed reading is about attractive to me as speed sex -- both are fine if all </i><br>

<p>
Hey now that you brought it up there is a parallel here.  One could compare<br>
the slow and careful reading of a few books to monogamy and consider various<br>
levels of promiscuous reading behavior.  Of course sex has a much stronger<br>
biological connection than reading and an interesting human is much more<br>
complex than any book.  Also sex beyond the basics of reproduction <br>
(and bonding?) is a more recreational behavior (contrary to the urgings of <br>
our genes).  I suppose a better analogy is conversation.  Does one spend<br>
a weekend talking to Francis Crick, a weekend at a neuroscience convention,<br>
or a weekend at grand central station.  I sure am glad I have a lot of<br>
weekends left to figure this out I'd hate to pick the wrong one. :-)<br>
