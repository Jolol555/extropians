<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; How can this be easy when</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 11. Intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; these are hard?  I find 11 pretty easy -- starting with chips that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; connect to your brain and help you calculate or just give you more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; memory, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To explain IA you need to dip into cognitive science.  To convey IA you</i><br>
<i>&gt;need more text and attention than we're likely to have plus it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;impossible anyway.</i><br>
<p>
Insulting the intelligence of your audience is not the way to put them<br>
in a receptive state.  And I think you're trying to explain driving by<br>
starting with internal combustion.  KISS!  "In the future, humans will<br>
use computers to make themselves smarter." should do fine.  Leave<br>
scientific rigor for the people who want to bother.  Damned if I'm going<br>
to study the schematics for the next airplane I fly in.  This is an<br>
_introductory_ letter!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To explain that IA is recursive, you just need to point out that IAs are</i><br>
<i>&gt;better at coming up with new IAs.  This only takes a paragraph.</i><br>
<p>
But save it for after the first one.  Induction needs a base case!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Nope, sorry.  I'm an extropian and immortalist already, and _I'm_ not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; convinced that uploading is all that attractive -- I _like_ having</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a body.  Nanotech on the other hand I like.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        You'll know better as a Power, so I won't bother persuading you.</i><br>
<p>
So don't bother persuading them, either!  At most, present uploading as<br>
something that people who want to can do; if you know people will want<br>
to, keep it to yourself -- don't try to force them to change their<br>
self-conceptions to that extent.  But, it's your foot to shoot off...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The people you're talking to are humans.  Most of them won't like the sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of that one bit, not to mention that it will sound millenial/apocalylptic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; or like just another woo-woo "Strange Universe" segment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, we need to avoid this as much as possible.  But the truth is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Universe is strange, and the materialistic Utopias of nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt;invoke childish fantasies of omnipotence.  Do you have a practical</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggestion for conveying the flavor of Beyond without running into those</i><br>
<i>&gt;memes?</i><br>
<p>
No, so leave the Beyond out of it, except perhaps for a vague reference<br>
to being "smarter and more powerful than we can imagine with the brain<br>
power we have now".<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 10. Gray goo problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'd leave this out of an introductory letter.  Alarmism is for missionaries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Amplify, please.  I'm not challenging you - I just don't understand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;How does alarmism reduce the survival potential of a meme?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe it doesn't per se, but you want people to be alarmed about the<br>
results of _not_ embracing your meme, not of embracing it!  "Here's a<br>
great new car, for a great price, but it has a bomb under the hood<br>
that could go off anytime -- want one?"<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 13. Replacement of human society: End of History.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;        The Singularity is not one of your petty memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Thrillsville.  The end of history; just what I wanted.  Foo.  Show me</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; how it will be the beginning of a new, better history, and I might</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; want some.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Translating to memetic terms, I think you're saying that this isn't as</i><br>
<i>&gt;gripping as a bright new future that they can comprehend.</i><br>
<p>
Eliezer, wake up!  I'm not saying it's not gripping -- I'm saying it's<br>
repulsive!  If you take no other piece of advice I offer, take this one:<br>
toss the "end" idea altogether, and replace it completely with the idea<br>
of "new beginnings".  To most people, endings mean grief (basic psychology)<br>
-- you don't want people associating Singularity with loss, but with gain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Good point.  Add this to subject matter:</i><br>
<i>&gt;"13.5: Singularity is a good thing."</i><br>
<i>&gt;I tried to convey this with nanotech etc., but it may deserve its own</i><br>
<i>&gt;paragraph before 14-Interim.</i><br>
<p>
"Singularity is a good thing" won't cut it as an explanation for why<br>
it should be the Interim Meaning of Life.  There are lots of Good<br>
Things.  Anyhow, why are you concerned?  It seems to me that the<br>
Singularity will happen at about the same time whether the masses<br>
are trying to rush it or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        So what's with all the constructive criticism?  Seriously, this is</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting into a debate, but since you've challenged the project rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than the content, that's okay.  It's more a "technological progress is</i><br>
<i>&gt;about to go over the deep end" thing.  Although the outline may read as</i><br>
<i>&gt;apocalyptic, what we are attempting to convey is the "WHAM WHAM WHAM</i><br>
<i>&gt;WHAM" flavor of the Singularity, in association with nanotech.</i><br>
<p>
People want to be at the helm, not overrun by a juggernaut.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        Bear in mind that memes have to spread.  The "End of History" meme has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been around for awhile.</i><br>
<p>
And people have been afraid of it, or expecting the reign of &lt;choose a<br>
deity&gt; to come after it, for all that time.  Stay _far_ _away_ from that<br>
idea (see above).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Incidentally, the Singularity page reads like a religious tract and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; math thesis mixed freely.  If that's what you want, great, but realize</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that most people won't have the capacity, much less the attention span,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to read and understand it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;All my favorite works read like that.  "Shadows of the Mind" and "Godel,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Escher, Bach" come to mind.  Win or lose, you've still learned the math,</i><br>
<p>
Most people will not bother trying to read any math more complicated than<br>
percents.  If you want to have a hope in hell of being a successful<br>
memetic engineer, come off your intellectual high horse and watch some<br>
TV commercials -- take your anti-credulity shots, stop fast-forwarding<br>
for a while, and see what memes people are being infected with today.<br>
Pay attention to the ad campaigns that stay around for a month or more<br>
-- Coca-Cola has lots of money, but not to waste.<br>
<p>
I, for one, hope that whoever came up with the Energizer Bunny is rich<br>
today -- "It keeps going and going..." is a masterpiece.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And I appreciate that.  But I do wish you would be a bit more specific.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry.  You get what I've got.  Maybe I'm a memetic artist as opposed to<br>
a memetic engineer.  Do what you can with it.<br>
