<p>
 I'm not a bunch that wants to live forever. I'm a mind that wants<br>
its memories and behavior patterns to be followed by a series of mental<br>
states for which:<br>
 - no mental state lacks any memories or behavior patterns that its<br>
  immediate predecessor had, unless the immediate predecessor mental<br>
  state wanted to get rid of those memories or behavior patters, and<br>
 - there are frequent improvements in the memories and behavior patterns<br>
  of the mental states.<br>
 Why should I care whether the means I use to accomplish these goals<br>
fall within the definition of death?<br>
<p>
 I don't think I want to live forever, because that implies a stagnation<br>
of identity that is inconsistent with my current value system. As long<br>
as I am replacing my identity with improved versions of my current self,<br>
I expect that the identity "Peter McCluskey as he exists in 1996" will<br>
exist to gradually lesser extents in future years, and that even if the<br>
fractions of my 1996 identity which exist in each succeeding year is an<br>
infinite series, the sum of those fractions will probably be a finite<br>
number.<br>

<p>
 I can't explain why you "should" care about future beings that are<br>
nearly identical to your current self. I am merely pointing out that<br>
you haven't convinced me that you have a nonarbitrary reason for caring<br>
more the being who awakes tomorrow in the Damien Broderick body than<br>
you care about the uploaded being with memories and behavior patterns<br>
indistinguishable from those of the Damien Broderick of today.<br>

 I haven't seen an Extropy #17 either.<br>
