Uh.  The problem here is having organizations where lots of people will<br>
do what someone else wants.  Such seem to be endemic to the human<br>

In the real world, there's public land, and even more public air and<br>
water, and yes, unethical businesses cheerily go after those.  So do<br>

The problem I see with your form of anarchy is that it requires a<br>
commitment to mutual aid which is probably unrealistic to expect of any<br>
grouping of autonomous entities, of any species.<br>

But how?  Bottom-up approach: tear down any one who's getting too large.<br>
A very common solution, used by many tribes through accusations of<br>
sorcery.  "He's wealthy, he must be using sorcery, he caused my chickens<br>
to become sick."  None of these tribes are going to the stars any time<br>
soon.<br>
<p>
Top-down: have a really big power that can easily minimize anyone else's<br>
power.  The problem is obviously to control the great power.<br>

At the moment we seem to have a middling approach, of letting multiple<br>
powers form and play against each other, including a government.<br>
Long-term success is unknown.<br>

Yep.  But anarcho-capitalism hopes to work by letting people's<br>
meanness cancel out and channeling their greed into mutually useful<br>
areas.  Pollution is coming through a channel that needs to be blocked.<br>
<p>
Anarcho-socialism, or whatever you want to call it, seems to require<br>
that people be nice.  <br>
