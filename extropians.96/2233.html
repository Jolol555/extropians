<i>&gt;    Thanks, have his books on my shelves (read them too!), but my question</i><br>
<i>&gt;was phrased poorly..."Is anyone familiar with somewhere I could physically</i><br>
<i>&gt;transport myself to in order to *experience* (undoubtedly only one of many</i><br>
<i>&gt;theoretical ideas of "what" the uploaded lifestyle would feel like) a type</i><br>
<i>&gt;of "upload" consciousness?" I am referring to "shedding the body" (hence</i><br>
<i>&gt;involving sensory deprivation to diminish sensory input), and using </i><br>
<i>&gt;thought (?) to manipulate a "created" environment. </i><br>
<p>
Read the Bible's book of Genesis and thats pretty much how the uploaded<br>
lifestyle would be. You could create anything spontaneously or rapidly<br>
evolve it from a metaphysical goo just by thinking about it because an<br>
algorithm could read your virtual brainwaves. You could then proceed to<br>
create an entire universe, possibly one even better designed than we<br>
currently have. Then you could proceed creating worlds with thousands of<br>
living organisms on them. You could multitask your brain and create multiple<br>
things at the same time dividing up the brain's timeslices for multiple<br>
tasks of various sorts. You could keep areas of your universe private only<br>
allowed to you or specified people such as friends and you could make parts<br>
that are public like websites are.<br>
