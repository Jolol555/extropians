<p>
(Did I write that? Yuck!) If ontology means 'truth' then I'M INCORRECT. <br>
I think I was using it to refer to 'certainty'.  I am _not_ a nihilist,<br>
though my tendency toward ambiguity might sometimes be interpreted that<br>
way!<br>

On Friday, September 27, 1996 6:51PM Jeff Dee thoughtfully wrote in<br>
response (that is, he made a constructive rather than destructive<br>
criticism):<br>
"Our ignorance of something doesn't stop it from being true.  The burden<br>
is on *us* to find out what is actually going on, whether we can do so<br>
perfectly or not.  Telling ourselves that 'reality' is only whatever we<br>
happen to think it is at the moment is not helpful."<br>
<p>
I'm 100% certain that I agree with you!  However, that certainty is a<br>
subjective feeling, not an objective truth. I'm also 'certain' that we<br>
can never be completely certain about most *things*, as opposed to<br>
*feelings*.  Is that a paradox or "conceptual drivel"?  I agree that the<br>
most important thing is, as you say, to be always questioning, trying to<br>
reduce uncertainty.<br>
