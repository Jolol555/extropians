<p>
Right.  That's why no one is _paying_ me to ponder this question yet ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt;  when and if such problems are solved there remains the possibility that</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  cause of death can never be fixed.  </i><br>
<p>
After the passage of the (usually brief) "contestibility period", cause of<br>
death is basically irrelevant to the payment of a life insurance death<br>
benefit (except for on-going suicide exclusions and certain cause-related<br>
benefit multipliers).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So when somebody is frozen, you can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  know whether they'll eventually end up alive or dead, and (this is the</i><br>
point)<br>
<p>
My questions were really aimed at a time we hope to see when reanimation is a<br>
more probable event, presumably because it has been successfully demonstrated<br>
on at least a higher-order whole organism.  At that point there would still<br>
not be _certainty_ about reanimation of any particular individual human, but<br>
the _possibility_ or reanimation might become an actuarially significant<br>
probability.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  you *never* will know that they will remain dead forever.  </i><br>
<p>
Knowing things _for sure_ isn't the business of insurance.  Insurance is<br>
about probabilities applied to large groups as risk-classes.  Of course<br>
"death" is now taken as a certainty by life insurance companies, but _life<br>
expectancy_ is treated as a probabilistic phenomenon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So the only time</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you could reasonably pay out would be at the normal death/freezing.  If</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  life companies maintain they should never pay for somebody who (at the</i><br>
time<br>
<i>&gt;  of benefits) may well never live again they'll be laughed out of court.</i><br>
<p>
There are theories that were once laughed out of court that are now taken as<br>
bedrock foundations of legal doctrine.  As Justice Holmes said, "the law is<br>
not a brooding omniprescence in the sky".  Of course denying a benefit now<br>
for a cryonically suspended human would be untenable -- but it might not be<br>
if a whole mammal had been successfully frozen and reanimated.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Since all the life insurance companies have planned and priced their</i><br>
policy<br>
<i>&gt;  without accounting for suspension/reanimation they will just maintain that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  policy.  It's no problem for them, and there really is no other logical</i><br>
way<br>
<i>&gt;  to handle it.</i><br>
<p>
When actuarially significant facts change, insurance policy wordings,<br>
underwriting and ratings change.  It happened with AIDS.  The issue I raise<br>
is admittedly less clear-cut than that example, but it could have an impact<br>
-- almost certainly _will_ have an impact if succesful human reanimation<br>
becomes a regular event.  (I don't even refer at this point to the questions<br>
that would be raised by a succesfull "destructive" upload ... essentially<br>
similar issues, presumably.)  <br>
<p>
As for this question being "no problem", it seems that it could be if people<br>
were free to choose to be suspended at a point short of their otherwise<br>
"natural" time of death as a means to improve the chances of reanimation;<br>
likewise with "destructive" uploads (mortality tables would become skewed).<br>
 Beyond this, insurance companies tend to not pay claims that don't fall<br>
within the terms of their coverage.  If the line between life and death<br>
becomes blurred, the terms of coverage could become ambiguous.  Actuaries and<br>
claims adjusters hate ambiguity.  (Lawyers love it.)  Who knows, maybe they'd<br>
take the "salvage" approach jokingly suggested by Dejan Vucinic in another<br>
post!<br>
