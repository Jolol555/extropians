Nobody wants to sell you novel technologies because they're novel. They <br>
want to sell them because they sell profitably. One cannot exclude social <br>
engineering on free markets, orelse the markets cease to be free. One has <br>

Human stupidity is the root of every single problem. It eclipses every <br>

Agree absolutely. I suggest introduce the "science(tm)". Everybody <br>
claiming to be a scientist (Christian science, domestic science, etc.) <br>
but failing to meet criteria for a scientific enterprise oughta be sued.<br>
