<p>
If you value yourself you don't avoid all risks. Risks are an essential<br>
aspect of living a full life. Survival without flourishing is not valuing<br>
yourself.<br>

<p>
We probably all agree that our own *survival* is not the one and only<br>
driving force, however, if not our own survival then what? Feelings? Where<br>
do they come from? Subconscious evaluations. How do we *consciously*<br>
evaluate them? Some of our emotions are destructive to us. Values? How do we<br>
establish those? How do we set our goals?<br>
<p>
Whatever we live for has to be based on our values, not so? Theses values<br>
are on a spectrum from subconscious (emotions) to conscious (rational).<br>
<p>
Anders, and others: What are those other driving forces? Especially ones<br>
that you may consider more important than your own survival and happiness?<br>
<p>
I personally strive to have all my values, emotions and actions focused on<br>
personal survival and well-being - important aspects of which include<br>
meaningful human relationships and a free and healthy society. I consider<br>
reason to be the best method to achieve these goals - and emotions essential<br>
to enjoying them.<br>
