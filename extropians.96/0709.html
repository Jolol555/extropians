I derive a significant portion of my income from writing, so I've given<br>
this considerable thought.  First, I think the threat of copyright-free<br>
cyberspace is greatly exaggerated.  I don't see books and magazines losing<br>
their advantage over on-screen and computer printout documents any time<br>
soon.  Second, it would require draconian government measures (which many<br>
technocrats and lawyers would welcome) to enforce copyrights in cyberspace.<br>
Chris Hind hit the nail on the head: what people will pay for in<br>
cyberspace is immediacy -- and there are technical means of defending that<br>
advantage.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what to do for poets.  Very few make enough money to worry<br>
about.  Personally, I think poets -- who are supposed to be creative<br>
people, right? -- need to come up with a few new marketing angles.  Perhaps<br>
richly-illustrated texts or a for-profit, Poem-of-the-moment service on the<br>
Net.  Hey, if people call 900 numbers for astrologers and wake-up calls...<br>
Think about it.<br>
<p>
But if you get rich with my Poem-of-the-moment idea, remember: you owe me<br>
royalties. &lt;g&gt;<br>
