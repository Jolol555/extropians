Regardless of what the truth is I like the idea of the game. There is, or <br>
will be an AI on this list. I know this to be a fact. Should we vote?<br>
I think it's Natasha V. More. <br>

<i>&gt; ::The Extropians have accepted it as part of the group.  No one notices</i><br>

another human. In other words, this program has passed the Turing test, <br>
so far.<br>
	This remains true.  Even after being told that there is an AI on <br>
the list, no one has seriously raised the question of whether one of the <br>
posters on the list is an AI.  Jokingly, yes.  Seriously, no.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The program continues to pass the test with flying colors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ira, how can you confidently say "way above anything yet achieved</i><br>
<i>&gt; by AI?"  You only know what has been achieved in the past.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The point is, this program from CMU is *new*.  It is a quantum leap</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond earlier AI programs.  This is the first time an AI program</i><br>
<i>&gt; has been unleashed on an unsuspecting world, and left to fend for itself. And it is doing very well.</i><br>
