I wish to re-start this thread which I had to abandon (because of lack of time)<br>
ten days ago without answering some of the replies.<br>
<p>
Max M's post of today gives me the segue which I needed:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Privacy is something very personal. I think the biggest problem with having</i><br>
<i>&gt;cameras everywhere would be with the most immideate family. How would you</i><br>
<i>&gt;like your wife, mother, mother in-law, lover, mistress... to be able to se</i><br>
<i>&gt;how you behaved at the last party you where at. Did you dance a little to</i><br>
<i>&gt;close to someone, did you talk about things a little to personal. Did you</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps even kiss someone in drunken happines?</i><br>
<p>
Why are you so concerned? Are you ashamed of your behavior? If so, then why did<br>
you do it? And isn't it then something that you will strive to correct? Or do<br>
you like being ashamed? Or are the people who you don't want to know about your<br>
behavior so irrational and non-understanding that they will think ill of you<br>
for your behavior? If so, why do you wish to continue to associate with them?<br>
Don't you wish to associate with people who will accept what you are and esteem<br>
you *because* of it, not *in spite* of it? Or at the very least with people who<br>
will accept *all* that you are because of some high qualities which are<br>
attractive to them.<br>
     I believe that, if not an "abnormal" life, it is a mentally unhealthy<br>
life, to be wishing to hide things from people. As stated before the only<br>
exceptions which I would make are when dealing with governments or others who I<br>
suspect will have no compunction against stealing from me or otherwise coercing<br>
me.<br>

Then undemonize them! Or don't you believe that good memes can drive out bad?<br>
Coercive people are another matter. You must either convince them that coercion<br>
is not in their self interest or you must eliminate them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What about not wanting to be ogled naked in your living room by every &gt;lecher</i><br>
who might wander by?<br>
<p>
Are you ashamed of the way your naked body looks? If so, why aren't you doing<br>
something about it? And why on earth does it matter to you what is in the head<br>
of anyone else so long as s/he does not coerce you? Especially, what is in the<br>
head of a total (and irrational) stranger?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What about not wanting anybody to know about the surprise party you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;planning for someone, lest word get back to them and the treat be ruined?  </i><br>
This is an interesting one which I hadn't considered. Personally, I don't place<br>
much value on surprises. I would always rather know and would be even more<br>
pleased and happy with the party if I could prepare myself and look forward to<br>
it. However, I can't think of any deep important reasons to fault someone who<br>
likes to be surprised.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What about wanting to avoid telling what you know about something that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are proud of but happens to be illegal?  I could think of many such &gt;examples,</i><br>
but I have other things to do<br>
<p>
You are correct here. I too have many such examples. I am really addressing the<br>
question of why anyone should want privacy in a truly free society.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;in my view a person who has high self esteemm, ie. is proud of all his/her</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;thoughts and actions should have no need for any privacy and, in fact, should</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be completely happy to have these things all open to the public.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think there may be a confusion on exactly what level we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are discussing "privacy" on.  I understand what you're saying,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that people who are intensely private are missing out on a lot,</i><br>
<p>
Although it may be true, that's not what I was trying to say. I am quite<br>
unsociable. I miss out on a lot anyway by personal choice. But what I long for<br>
is to be able to fully communicate myself at high bandwidth when I do wish to<br>
do it. And I would be willing to do it continuously (except to those who would<br>
coerce me) in order to achieve the benefits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but really what you're talking about is privacy as a personality trait.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the rationality and personal desirability of privacy in a free society is<br>
my topic for debate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is a more basic concern to myself as a libertarian is the RIGHT to</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy.</i><br>
<p>
As a former libertarian (I don't like to call myself that anymore, since I<br>
believe that I have long since gone above and beyond 'mere' libertarianism) I<br>
no longer believe in the RIGHT to privacy (in a totally free society. A RIGHT<br>
is only valid when it is the 'natural' default condition, ie. when in order to<br>
have that right one need only be left alone, ie. not be coerced on ones own<br>
private property. PRIVACY is not primary to this paradigm. It can only be a<br>
consequence of have a right to prevent trespass onto you property. If methods<br>
of detection and readout of anyone's activities become so advanced that<br>
whatever you are doing, thinking, etc. can be determined without coercion of<br>
yourself or trespass of your property, then privacy quite properly goes out the<br>
window.<br>
<p>
IAN GODDARD expressed this very well when he wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;IAN: The only "right to privacy" I have is a right to the privacy I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt;able to maintain.  For example, if I don't want to be seen naked, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd better build a house, put me in it and close the windows when naked.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I don't close my windows, I cannot tell people in exterior properties</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they cannot examine the photons traveling from my property onto </i><br>
<i>&gt;theirs which convey information about my property, and indeed, such </i><br>
<i>&gt;a claim on my part would violate private-property protocols.</i><br>
<p>
Wade goes on:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How open can you be to anyone individual when anyone and everyone could hear</i><br>
<i>&gt;what you're saying?</i><br>
<p>
So what, if they are not going to coerce you!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I consider counterproductive is people who demand of you at every turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;"What are doing? What are you working on? Why are you wasting time with that?</i><br>
<p>
Unless they have something constructive to contribute, why can't you just<br>
ignore them? Why must you let *your* life and *your* thoughts be controlled by<br>
anyone else, certainly not by such nosey, meddlesome people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You can be proud as you want of what you're thinking, but if you're in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation where there are people who will attack,</i><br>
<p>
agreed, if you mean physically. If not why care, verbal attackers ultimately<br>
just harm their own image in others minds. They some get to be known and their<br>
opinions dismissed by those rational people whose esteem you would desire.<br>
Physical attackers should be eliminated from the gene pool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;verbally abuse,</i><br>
<p>
Who cares?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;or even lock you up for saying it,</i><br>
<p>
agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;you had better be able to practice some disgression about who is hearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;you and who isn't. </i><br>
<p>
In my book, you got two right and one wrong :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;better world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have serious reservations about this sentiment.  The problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;of violence don't come from lack of adequate means of  communication, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather the refusal to communicate on a meaningful, productive level,</i><br>
<i>&gt;invariably stemming from  an initial refusal to think at all.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  All the ESP type powers given to people not inclined to some modicum of</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational thought and respect for other individuals will not a utopia make.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sorry, but its a classic case of putting the carriage before the horse.</i><br>
<p>
I was questioning why we want privacy to suggest removing it completely as a<br>
practical current alternative. I was simply suggesting its removal would be<br>
productive and rational the system we all desire in the future. Hey, I thought<br>
you extropians were always busy working out how the world of the future will<br>
function in excruciating detail when is it highly unlikely to evolve in any way<br>
much related to what you now think and most of your hours of work and debate<br>
will have been totally wasted (in any practical sense except for the purposes<br>
of mental exercise and masturbation). Can't I too have my occasional fling to<br>
this sort of day-dreaming? :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;My basic point here is to question the rationality of anyone valuing privacy.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, as long as they don't coerce you, then such actions will always lead to<br>
more information to yourself and a better understanding of those who you are<br>
associated with (and perhaps should abandon).<br>

I don't care if I am 'judged' negatively by others. That is *their* problem so<br>

something of which I am proud, I will in term judge them negatively and<br>
associate with them less. I would rather know this than not know it.<br>

<p>
I certainly don't want to eliminate differences in judgement of behavior in<br>
people. This would be a very stifling boring society. I need continuous input<br>
of the judgement of others in order to continually evaluate my behavior and to<br>
determine if it is something which I can be proud of. If someone who I highly<br>
esteem judges some behavior or thought of mine negatively then I will give<br>
his/her opinion very serious consideration. If someone I despise or don't even<br>
know does the same, I will generally ignore it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;People today  communicate their 'private' thoughts and actions,</i><br>

<p>
I totally agree. My problem with this has always been the small bandwidth of<br>
such communication which is possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another point is, that people in general show a tendency to 'react' to</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge of another individuals thoughts, (considered private or not) when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they either share those thoughts enthousiastically or disagree with that</i><br>

<p>
If this were true it would be good, unfortunately, I think that people usually<br>
react much more strongly when they see something they judge wrong them when<br>
they see something they judge right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Under the current situation, sharing your</i><br>

<p>
My hope would be that by vastly increasing the openness and totally of my<br>
communication with them, their "dogmas" (about me anyway) would be able to be<br>
broken.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Have you considered other consequenses of what you suggest ? Some</i><br>

We would all be stronger for having to learn not to be manipulated as we grow<br>
up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Children would get away with doing things, by being able to candidly read the</i><br>

<p>
One should never lie, most especially to children. It is ultimately always<br>
harmful to their well being. Being 'tough on' children is certainly necessary<br>
and it is better if the child fully understands what is going on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The same could go to some extent, for those individuals in society who hold a</i><br>

<i>&gt;not be able to see the parents 'reason', individuals may not see eachothers</i><br>
<i>&gt;'reason' wether based on intellectual differences, or cultural differences.</i><br>
<p>
This sounds somewhat elitist and repugnant to me. Especially, with children one<br>
should always explain and give reasons for everything even when they are too<br>
young to understand the reasons. In this way, they come to understand that the<br>
world is rational (or should be) and that there are reasons for everything. And<br>
when they are older this view causes them to think and to seek the reasons for<br>
everything around them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or do you suggest we become a homogenous population of equal intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;and cultural 'values'?</i><br>
<p>
No, and we could not if we tried. What I do suggest it that we 'treat' everyone<br>
who does not use forcer or fraud as an intellectual and cultural peer. For that<br>
is the best way to help and induce them to become so.<br>
