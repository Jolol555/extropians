From: hanson@hss.caltech.edu (Robin Hanson)<br>
<i>&gt; Whether smarter beings can create still smarter beings at a faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate than lessor beings can improve on themselves depends on how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty of the task of getting smarter scales with intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It could be that the task gets harder so fast that smarter beings take</i><br>
<i>&gt; *longer* to get still smarter.  We know far too little to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this isn't the case.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is a good point.  The same thing may happen in general with<br>
technological improvement.  The law of diminishing returns can be<br>
expected to apply to super-intelligent beings as well as to us.  Whether<br>
the greater capabilities in the future will be enough to outmatch the<br>
greater problems they face, we can't say.<br>
<p>
I read a book many years ago, Infinity_and_the_Mind, by Rudy Rucker.<br>
I didn't really like it very much; it seemed to approach the mathematical<br>
and philosophical concept of infinity from a rather mystical direction.<br>
But he did make some points that have stuck with me.<br>
<p>
Mathematically, there are many orders or classes of infinity.  In fact,<br>
there are an infinite number of infinities, because of the general rule<br>
that the size of the set of all subsets of a set S is always bigger<br>
than the size of set S.  It also makes a different whether you are<br>
talking about ordinal numbers, which might include infinity plus 1,<br>
infinity times 2, and such, versus the more familiar cardinal numbers,<br>
which are the sizes of things.<br>
<p>
The interesting thing is that as you move to the higher cardinal numbers,<br>
there is no general rule which can be used to understand the progression.<br>
Each class of infinity represents a new direction, a new problem, which<br>
must be understood on its own grounds.  From the counting numbers, we<br>
go to the real numbers (which are a lot more complex than most people<br>
realize); then to the set of all functions.  I don't think anybody<br>
knows where we go from there.<br>
<p>
This kind of transition is inherent to the problem; anything which can<br>
be mapped onto an earlier level is no bigger than that value.  It is<br>
only when there is a change in the nature of what is counted that we<br>
go to a new level of infinity.<br>
<p>
This suggests to me that super-intelligences may be faced with similar<br>
problems as they advance.  There will be levels, or plateaus, where they<br>
advance to the limit that is possible at that level.  Then some new<br>
fundamental breakthrough is needed to advance to a new level.  Being<br>
smart is not just a matter of being fast (in my opinion), but involves<br>
qualitative changes.<br>
<p>
