<i>&gt;Hans Moravec describes one model in _Mind Children_, where the experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;most of the time is quite normal, until the robot surgeon says 'Mr Snapp,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you will become virtual now' and you suddenly wake up in a virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gradual uploading would be extremely different from this, and uploading </i><br>
<i>&gt;from a cryonic state would also be quite different. The result, an </i><br>
<i>&gt;emulated mind living in a virtual world, would probably more easily be </i><br>
<i>&gt;modelled by using a very good virtual reality.</i><br>
<p>
Why would gradual uploading be different? All you need to do is leave the<br>
sensory input channels for last and then ask the individual when they want<br>
to go virtual. When they go virtual they'd instantly see a virtual world<br>
layed out before them. I must admit, the feeling of suddenly becoming<br>
virtual would be cool and merely the thought would probably release<br>
endorphins in the virtual brain due to the idea that "You can do ANYTHING<br>
now" and that no laws of physics hamper you! Damn that would be cool! I'm<br>
getting stoked just thinking about it. :) You people better start<br>
considering what type of environment you want to wake up in as a digital<br>
being or homo digitus :)<br>
