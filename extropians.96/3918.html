Sent to David Brin and The Extropian List:<br>
<p>
It is a well known phenomenon that you challenge somebody's pet ideas all you <br>
want to and anger is seldom produced provided the person having the <br>
brainstorm can strongly defend it. On the other hand, if he can think of no  <br>
way to defend his concepts then some people are not grateful for having their  <br>
errors corrected but become enraged.<br>
<p>
I just received in private E mail a response from Mr. Brin about my recent  <br>
post commenting on his "Transparent society". Mr. Brin Informed me that all <br>
of my points were wrong. It would have been nice if he could have, elaborated <br>
a little and explained exactly why I was wrong but Mr. Brin is a busy person, <br>
discussing the issues I raised would have taken time and a man needs to set  <br>
priorities. Make sure a personal insult is inserted into every line and then  <br>
if you have any time left over, say a word or two about the issues.<br>
<p>
There is one thing I said that he especially disliked.          <br>
<p>

<i>                         &gt;&gt;Without accountability, freedom will die.</i><br>

<i>           &gt;Thus I assume you also oppose using a secret ballot in elections.                              </i><br>
<p>
Mr. Brin told me this was offensive and he was certain it was deliberate, <br>
because of this gross misconduct on my part he was breaking off further <br>
commutation with me. I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to deduce <br>
if this is this author's true reason for not wanting to continue a  debate on <br>
the very subject he is currently writing a book on.                              <br>
