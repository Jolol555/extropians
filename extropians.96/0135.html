Nick Nicholas (whoever he is) writes:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Darwinian evolution has been discredited, do your reading</i><br>
<p>
I'm quoting this exactly as written; it appears that Mr. Nicholas hasn't <br>
heard about putting periods at the end of sentences.  It also appears that <br>
we have been invaded by creationists.  <br>
<p>
Nick, in a scientific/philosopical forum such as this one, it is customary <br>
to give reasons for one's assertions.  So  if you have something to say, <br>
say it.  Otherwise go back to Sunday School where you belong.  (The <br>
etiquette of the list prevents me, for the moment at least, from using the <br>
more colorful language that first came to mind when I read this nonsense.)  <br>
