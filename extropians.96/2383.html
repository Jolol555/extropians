Lyle said "Maybe that's a sacred cow -- I always assume that there is a cause <br>
for whatever happens.  More precisely, I assume that the best way to proceed <br>
in most situations is to look for causes.  This is something that I don't <br>
think I would be willing to question."<br>
<p>
I agree with you that looking for the causes of things is a good way to <br>
understand how things work.  However, I wonder why you are unwilling to <br>
question this.  Questioning something does not mean that you are denying it, <br>
saying it is incorrect.  It simply means you are probing deeper into the <br>
subject, so that you can understand it better.  My experience has shown me <br>
that questioning my beliefs is always beneficial, even very basic beliefs.  If <br>
they are valid and worthwhile beliefs, then the process of questioning tends <br>
to strengthen them, and if they are invalid or have errors, then the process <br>
of questioning reveals that to me, and I seek to correct my flawed beliefs.  <br>
Questioning my beliefs has always been very educational for me, and engaging <br>
in that activity helps me clarify my thinking, so that I become a more <br>
powerful and accurate thinker.<br>
<p>
I think that if you questioned your notions of causality you would gain a <br>
better understanding of why you think that way, and perhaps your questioning <br>
will help you gain some truly deep insights into the nature of causality.<br>
<p>
A bad idea's worst fear is to be questioned, for then it will be seen for what <br>
it truly is.<br>
<p>
A good idea's greatest desire is to be questioned, for then it will be seen <br>
for what it truly is.<br>
