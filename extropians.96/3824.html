Once in a while you hear people say that they *use* technology, but they<br>
don't get obsessed with it; they keep it in its place--it's "only a tool"--<br>
and (these people say) this is how technology should be viewed and treated.<br>
<p>
There's an important point here that even the "only a tool"<br>
people seem to miss: by not being curious about the technology itself,<br>
people end up taking it as a given, passively accepting others' design<br>
decisions and even accepting the fault for bad interactions with technology.<br>
<p>
But another interesting point is that being "only a tool" doesn't prevent<br>
something from changing the most basic things, including our identities.<br>
Which of the following "tools" didn't change the identities of their<br>
adopters?<br>
<p>
   Cell nuclei<br>
   Glue for making multicelled animals<br>
   Nerve cells, Spinal collumns<br>
   Opposable thumbs, straight backs, etc.<br>
   Words, facial expressions, body language<br>
   Leather jackets, motorcycles<br>
<p>
Another way to look at it is this: what's a "mutation" in evolution?<br>
It's the creation of a new enzyme, a new tool for the organism.  All we<br>
are are mutually-supporting collections of tools, and new tools are<br>
changes to ourselves, mutations.<br>
<p>
So on the one hand there is no way to stop technology from changing our<br>
identities, or from affecting all of the important questions.  The "only"<br>
in "only a tool" is false reassurance.  The word "tool" should sound<br>
like "ontological ice slick."  But on the other hand, the thing to do<br>
is to *make* tools more like tools and less like unchangeable facts of<br>
life, that is, to be more aware of and in control of the process of tool<br>
creation and assimilation.<br>
