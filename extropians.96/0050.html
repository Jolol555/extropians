<i>&gt;The claim of spontaneous order is tha if things repeatedly reorganize</i><br>

<p>
This is a funny claim, though, isn't it?  You are defining large-basined<br>
attractors of social dynamical systems as "good."  <br>
<p>
To make sense of this statement, you would need to define "good" in<br>
some other way, and then argue that there is in fact some reason why<br>
large-basined attractors of social systems are good.<br>
<p>
Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;most people born and raised in the US haven't seriously compared</i><br>
<i>&gt;it to other alternatives</i><br>
<p>
I am an American who has lived in two foreign countries, Australia and<br>
NEw Zealand -- neither one drastically different from the US, but<br>
different in many ways.  Certainly, compared to the US, these are bot<br>
h "democratic socialist" countries: you've got "the dole" for that<br>
percentage who don't want to work, you've got national healthcare,<br>
extremely high taxes, etc.  The welfare state is just about complete,<br>
although the state does NOT own the means of production.<br>
<p>
But, really, so what?  We're talking about drastic changes in <br>
technology which are expected to lead to drastic changes in society.<br>
What makes you think that any existing governmental system -- or any<br>
governmental system we have even THOUGHT about -- will still have<br>
meaning in 200 years time.<br>
<p>
I believe we need to think much more creatively about this stuff --<br>
myself included.  I don't believe in spontaneous order as you have<br>
outlined it, nor do I believe that the governmental systems we have now<br>
are anywhere near a fair statistical sample of the overall space of<br>
such systems.  <br>
<p>
Some of the attractors of the social dynamical systems are "good", others<br>
may be persistent but bad, like delusional belief systems of individuals.<br>
It is up to us to guide ourselves -- collectively -- toward the better<br>
attractors ... and to decide what we mean by "better"..<br>
