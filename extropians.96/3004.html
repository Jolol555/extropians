Well i think that a good way to look at the future of warfare is to look at<br>
what happens in something like QUAKE the game. Kids are programming bots in<br>
somthing called quakeC using neural nets fuzzy logic and what have you. The<br>
reaperBot 0.7 is especially hard to beat. It learns quickly from it's<br>
mistakes. Off course they have to die a few times before they get really<br>
good. But thats not really to unrealistic as any real *Terminator* would<br>
most likely be able to transfer their experinces to the great wireless<br>
Teminator network before they fade away completely.<br>
The Bots in quake of course has an extremely simple universe to traverse so<br>
not everything can be translated to real life. But the logic of things is:<br>
<p>
1) someone develops a bot. The bot soon gets a LOT better than the human<br>
players.<br>
2) this destroys the game for the human players so they develop bodyguard<br>
Bots<br>
3) Each player controls a certain amounts of bots so it gets to be a more<br>
tactical game than an action game.<br>
<p>
Imagine future warfare where each human soldier control a flock of robots,<br>
possibly by telepresence, and he with the best and most robots wins the<br>
battle. I think this is the most likely way for future warfare to go. Off<br>
course there will always be weapons that uses the battleaxe style instead<br>
of the scalpel style that robotic warfare represents.<br>
just look at it from a PR and political viewpoint. A Robowar will be<br>
relatively inexpensive(none of our boys got lost) and hi tech war material<br>
is always cool on the tube.<br>
<p>
Danish SF writer Niels E. Nielsen has written some good books that touches<br>
the subject. I don't know what their english title is.<br>
<p>
We allready got loads of massdestrucion capability. therefore i think that<br>
the development will be in precision and minimizing the number of<br>
casualties on *our* side.<br>
