Pope Accepts Theory of Evolution<br>
4:54pm EDT, 10/24/96<br>
<p>
VATICAN CITY - Pope John Paul II has lent his support to<br>
the theory of evolution, proclaiming it compatible with<br>
Christian faith in a step welcomed by scientists but likely<br>
to raise howls from the religious right. <br>
<p>
The Pope's recognition that evolution is "more than just<br>
a theory" came in a written message he sent Wednesday to<br>
a meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a body <br>
of experts that advises the Roman Catholic Church on<br>
scientific issues. <br>
<p>
It broke new ground by acknowledging that the theory of<br>
the physical evolution of man and other species through<br>
natural selection and hereditary adaptation appeared to<br>
be valid. <br>
<p>
Though the Pope made clear he regarded the human soul as<br>
of immediate divine creation, and so not subject to the<br>
process, his remarks brought banner headlines in the<br>
Italian press. <br>
<p>
"Pope says we may descend from monkeys," the conservative<br>
newspaper Il Giornale said on its front page. La Repubblica<br>
said the Pope had "made peace with Darwin." <br>
<p>
The theory of evolution, most notably expounded by 19th<br>
century English naturalist Charles Darwin, had until <br>
now been viewed by the Catholic Church as serious and <br>
worthy of discussion but still an open question. <br>
<p>
"It is indeed remarkable that this theory has progressively <br>
taken root in the minds of researchers following a series of <br>
discoveries made in different spheres of knowledge," the Pope said. <br>
<p>
"The convergence, neither sought nor provoked, of results of <br>
studies undertaken independently from each other constitutes <br>
in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory." <br>
<p>
The theories of Darwin and other evolutionists about man's <br>
origins were for long anathema to theologians, who saw a <br>
conflict with the biblical account of creation in the Book<br>
of Genesis and the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. <br>
<p>
Most theologians no longer believe that the doctrine that God <br>
created the world and made man in his own image and the theory <br>
of evolution stand in each other's way. <br>
<p>
But fundamentalist Christians who take a literal approach to <br>
Genesis, known as "creationists," have recently reopened the <br>
controversy, especially in the southern United States. <br>
<p>
In Tennessee, where teacher John Scopes was famously fined <br>
$100 by a court in 1925 for teaching evolution in his class <br>
in what became known as the Monkey Trial, a bill that would <br>
have banned teaching evolution as fact was only narrowly voted <br>
down in the state legislature earlier this year. <br>
<p>
The Vatican's first substantive response to the theories of <br>
evolution was contained in an encyclical, Humani Generis, <br>
written in 1950 by the Pope Pius XII. <br>
<p>
It cited no objection to discussing evolution while cautioning <br>
that the theory played into the hands of communists eager to cut <br>
God out of the equation. <br>
<p>
Pope John Paul II has previously endorsed the 1950 document. <br>
He said Wednesday its essential point was that "if the human <br>
body has its origin in living material which pre-exists it, <br>
the spiritual soul is immediately created by God." <br>
<p>
But he also said: "Today, nearly half a century after appearance <br>
of the encyclical, fresh knowledge leads to recognition of the <br>
theory of evolution as more than just a hypothesis." <br>
<p>
The Pope's acknowledgement was welcomed as a significant advance <br>
by scientists, even though some said it had come late. <br>
<p>
"It will allow many Catholic scientists, who have been engaged <br>
for some time in research on human evolution, to continue their work <br>
without any censure or difficulty," said Francesco Barone, a <br>
leading Italian scientific philosopher.<br>
