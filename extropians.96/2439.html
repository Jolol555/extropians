&lt;much worthwhile stuff *snipped*&gt;<br>
As I said, emotions are the logic of values.<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
Umm, how about "emotions are how we *sense* values."?<br>
I consider that discovering a feeling that surprises me provides a <br>
clue that I have a value I didn't know I had. Like noticing a funny <br>
smell in the room. I can then choose what to do about that. If the <br>
smell is one I'd like to experience more of, one set of activities <br>
might ensue; if I'd rather not experience it, other activities might <br>
be more appropriate.<br>
<p>
Steve sez:<br>
When people say that emotions are bad sources of information,<br>
what I understand to be going on is this: one part of their value system<br>
is telling me it doesn't like the urgings of other parts.  The person<br>
is saying that they have conflicts within their value system.  The fact<br>
that some emotions claim not to be emotions is the result of a lot of<br>
terrible ideas from our past.<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
*BINGO*!<br>
