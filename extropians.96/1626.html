I regret the rancor too. I can strongly disagree with somebody and still be <br>
quite found of them, but I'm only human (damn it). When somebody asks me to <br>
tell them exactly what is it about Nanotechnology manufacturing that makes it <br>
much easier to do than conventional manufacturing, and I take the time to <br>
respond with 6 fundamental reasons, and it is dismissed with 4 words, then <br>
I get mad. <br>
   <br>
Drexler has shown that Nanotechnology does not violate the laws of Physics or <br>
Economics. I think Drexler has also shown, in a general sort of way, how to <br>
do it, but there are a LOT of details, neither he nor anybody else has <br>
provided a complete flow-chart to achieve Nanotechnology, that's asking too <br>
much. If we could do that we'd be in the Singularity already.<br>
<p>
I agree entirely with Drexler's statement "Any critic declaring this to be an  <br>
optimistic book hereby stands charged with having failed to read and <br>
understand". Yes, nanotechnology will bring grave (and I do mean grave) <br>
social problems. No, draconian authoritarian controls will not work because <br>
although they may be draconian and authoritarian, they will not be able to <br>
control the coming changes, and no, I don't know what will. I wish I did.<br>
