This sounds like a great idea!  I'd like to try writing such a program in<br>
Java.  Is that an easy thing to do?  I've taken an introductory Java class,<br>
but I've never programmed my Mac before, and this seems like a golden<br>
opportunity to learn.  What would I need other than the free Java software<br>
from Sun (I think it runs on the Mac)?  I have a book on Java -- I assume<br>
I need one on Mac programming (or do I -- it _is_ supposed to be portable).<br>
Any suggestions of which one is best?<br>
<p>
I was thinking that a program that grabbed text from a SimpleText file<br>
and displayed sets of n words in a window would be easiest.  Then I<br>
thought I'd try grabbing from a Eudora message or a Web page, but<br>
I have no idea if that's easy or not.  Suggestions for places I should<br>
look are welcome.  (You experts can go get the whole thing done during my<br>
bathroom break if you like, but no telling me the whole solution unless I<br>
ask, OK?  I just want to get started without flailing _too_ much.)<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
