I didn't see GBurch's post, so maybe he clarified, but "incremental"<br>
is ambiguous.  We could propose our favorite system, and then propose<br>
that it apply to ten new people every second, eventually covering<br>
everyone in a century.  But this isn't probably what you mean.  You<br>
probably want a political feasible transition path.  Unfortunately,<br>
politics is messy, and varies with place and time.  Changes that might<br>
be feasible at one place and time will not be feasible elsewhere, and<br>
sometimes big changes are feasible.  <br>
<p>
My current approach to "incremental" is in terms of the intellectual<br>
arguments offered to limit freedom of contract.  Full freedom of<br>
contract gets us everything we want, and we already have a bit of<br>
freedom.  So I focus on increasing the scope of freedom of contract by<br>
indentifying first the weakest arguments for limiting such freedom,<br>
and hoping to damage them enough to topple the limits which rest only on<br>
those arguments.  And to make my counter-arguments stick as well as<br>
possible, I am formalizing them.  See my papers on democratic failure<br>
and product bans.<br>
<p>
Of course there are lots of other approaches.  When limits are local,<br>
then local politics can help make local incremental progress.  And<br>
when limits are national, moving those issues to local juristiction<br>
can fascilitate local incremental progress.<br>
