<i>&gt;&gt; Defend it Mike. Don't let one opinion get you down. Perhaps there is</i><br>

<i>&gt;He just proved that my system didn't violate conservation of momentum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;He did not show that there was not thrust produced, because he used the</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong equation. The sticking point is the mechanism for putting energy</i><br>
<i>&gt;into the sytem that will not act as an opposite reaction to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;centrifugal force extracted as thrust. I have it, and thats my</i><br>
<i>&gt;secret....</i><br>

You must obviously be hiding something unless you were putting out the<br>
Lorrey Drive into the public domain for free and which I doubt due to your<br>
want to make a fortune on it's design. Then again perhaps I'm in denial? I<br>
don't want this turning into faith.<br>
