<i>&gt; At some point there will be a device which </i><br>
<i>&gt; -- can disassemble generic stuff in the environment into feedstock,</i><br>
<p>
Not quite.  Disassembly and assembly don't have to be co-located in<br>
either time or space, though they could be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- scan any (house-or-smaller-sized) object for its atomic-level design,</i><br>
<p>
There is no upper limit on size:  you don't need to enclose the item<br>
being constructed.  Nor do you have to scan the whole item before you<br>
start assembling a replica, though it might help in some circumstances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- sythesize a plan for constructing such an object from feedstock,</i><br>
<p>
That may be the way to do it in some cases, but it's not the only way.<br>
"Rip up and try again" strategies such as used in circuit-board track<br>
laying could also be used.  Also, inevitably the experience of building<br>
a lot of different things will build up a database of component plans<br>
and heuristics for tackling such tasks, so "synthesizing a plan" may<br>
turn out to be a Lego-fitting exercise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- retool itself and construct the object with a low error rate, and</i><br>
<p>
Again, the "retooling" will probably entail selecting appropriate nano-<br>
factory components from a library, rather than doing it from scratch<br>
for each new job.  Items in the library will be those that experience<br>
has shown *can* be manufactured with a low error rate, no doubt.  The<br>
error rate in the end product will I expect be raised through iteration<br>
and constraint checking at the point of assembly.  Unlike in wafer<br>
fabrication, yield will not be limited by having to get it right on<br>
first attempt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- repair itself, or break slowly enough to replace itself anew often.</i><br>
<p>
Yes indeed.  One can expect to find a range of monitoring mechanisms to<br>
detect errors, isolate them, and replace the faulty units.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If such a device were smaller than a house,</i><br>
<p>
Size not relevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and could replace itself</i><br>
<i>&gt; in less than a year</i><br>
<p>
Drexler's estimates suggest that the likely timescale is minutes or hours.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; using stuff available from an acre of land,</i><br>
<p>
There's no restriction on source of feedstock.  Tunnel down, tunnel<br>
along, set up transcontinental feedstock pipelines if you want, or<br>
don't bother with continuous tunnels at all --- just send your emmissary<br>
out to where the feedstock is and bring it back to you, or else maybe<br>
manufacture the necessary part where the feedstock is and then have it<br>
transported back.  There's nothing that says you can't crawl around<br>
within the Earth's crust to your heart's content;  certainly a lot of<br>
nice challanges there.  In any event, "one acre" becomes irrelevant.<br>
That notion belongs to a time when property was defined by access to<br>
the *surface* of land and to a time when such restrictions could be<br>
enforced;  neither of these are valid in a nano world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and if</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyright on the design were not strictly enforced,</i><br>
<p>
It's unenforceable.  And anyway, why should anyone want to enforce it?<br>
This is "old world" thinking, based on the premise that current-day<br>
economics will survive unchanged into a nano age.  That belongs to<br>
another thread already in progress, so I won't say more here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but if property</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights to such acres of land were strictly and cheaply enforced, then</i><br>
<p>
A hell of a lot of if's.  Property rights?  Enforcement?  Cheap?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it would seem that within a hundred self-copy times, most everyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; owned an acre of land should have such a device, obtained at the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a small fraction of their acre.  And it seems they could then, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; they chose, soon have an acre full of devices for which the design</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyright was not strictly enforced.  And they might so choose if</i><br>
<i>&gt; public designs were not much worse than private designs, and if local</i><br>
<i>&gt; production were near as efficient as distant specialized production.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Given all this, some folks seem to want to infer that at some point</i><br>
<i>&gt; most living humans will fit the scenario of living off their own small</i><br>
<i>&gt; plot of land, using basically free designs.</i><br>
<p>
This is a figment built upon a mirage built upon a misconception.  The<br>
main misconception is, I think, that you see all the other institutions<br>
of the 20th century staying more or less unaffected by the progressive<br>
development of nano capabilities.  I find this extremely unlikely.  As<br>
the capability is put into use in more and more areas, it is likely to<br>
cause *extreme* uproar, panic and histeria among people that suddenly<br>
find they live in a shifting world of horrendous freedom, and the whole<br>
fabric of civilization is going to be given a severe shaking.  I don't<br>
know where it will lead, because people are unpredictable.  However, I<br>
know where the technology is leading, and that's very, very far away<br>
from the terribly limited scenario that you describe above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I've understood this right, I can challenge the conclusion by</i><br>
<i>&gt; pointing to all the assumptions that may not hold.</i><br>
<p>
You haven't, so you can't. (:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do no have much</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that eventually such a device will be possible to construct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, by that time many other changes may happen as well.  The sun</i><br>
<i>&gt; may dim due to intervening solar collectors, or the O2 and CO2 may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; stripped from the atmosphere.  An upload or other population explosion</i><br>
<i>&gt; may mean that the ratio of population to acres is far less than one.</i><br>
<p>
There's a causal inconsistency here.  In all the scenarios I've read,<br>
you need nano to give you control over matter before the above situations<br>
can arise.  It's also inconsistent with the estimates from Foresight.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or wealth may be very unequally distributed, so few can afford an</i><br>
<i>&gt; acre.</i><br>
<p>
Wealth?  Distribution?  If you want an acre, go and get it --- there's<br>
lots going spare, and if everyone does it (and they will because everyone<br>
wants more) then counter-measures are unenforceable because, presumably,<br>
the will of the people is what matters, no? (;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Copyright on these many devices may in fact be strictly enforced, by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; combination of self-destruction upon scan attempts</i><br>
<p>
Whatever is the point of so doing?  This sort of argument is still<br>
wedded to the product-is-wealth mentality.  Free yourself! (:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and draconian</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishments for violators.</i><br>
<p>
Unenforceable, and no point in enforcing it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Public domain designs of most sorts may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite inferior to private designs, or generic one-size-fits-all</i><br>
<i>&gt; devices may be rather inferior in efficiency to specialized devices,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even given shipping costs.</i><br>
<p>
Or public domain designs may be greatly superior to private designs,<br>
since there will probably be *vastly* greater resources in the public<br>
domain than in the private.  It's already true now in some walks of<br>
life:  eg. using a proprietary C compiler is asking for trouble, as<br>
the support you get from a private company is terrible compared to<br>
the support of thousands of GNU developers.  Anyway, what's this<br>
difference between public and private that we're talking about?  In<br>
a nano world where individuals and families can have the same kind<br>
of resources and capabilities as international corporations, these<br>
differences become more or less irrelevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Property rights to acres of land may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be cheaply enforced, but require payment of substantial taxes or PPL</i><br>
<i>&gt; fees.</i><br>
<p>
Think 3D, in the Earth's crust, in its oceans, and beyond the clouds.<br>
Yeah, it'll be war for the choice cuts, but I'm heading out of here<br>
anyway. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To pay such fees, one may have to devote a substantial fraction</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ones resources to production at an advanced level - public domain</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense system designs may be nowhere near up to the task.</i><br>
<p>
Why?  Public-domain systems ought to be far, far more capable than<br>
anything that a remnant of government or state can muster.  After all,<br>
who will want to continue to *work* for government or state?  What<br>
would be the point?<br>
<p>
[Robin, I must confess that I'm not sticking to the straight and<br>
narrow in much of the above, just because I'm having so much fun<br>
responding to your points because the world you see is so terribly<br>
*limited*.  You need to transcend a little bit quicker. :-)]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Finally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most people may prefer more to live be closer to other people, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; dense cities,</i><br>
<p>
Yuck.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; than to have their own isolated plot of gadgets.</i><br>
<p>
Yuck.  It's not like that at all.  Far more like living in your<br>
own world amid your loved ones and friends and defended by your<br>
own animates.  And it *will* be your own world.  The need for<br>
protective containment will see to that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now folks may have plausible arguments for each of these issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I'd like to hear them.  But what are the chances that *all* of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these issues go the way of this NanoDream?</i><br>
<p>
Collosal at present, because nobody has yet come up with any way of<br>
actually stopping it from happening, so it *will* happen because that's<br>
the direction in which the technology is heading.<br>
