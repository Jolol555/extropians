<i> &gt;The explosive used in 95% of all commercial blasting is ANFO, a mixture of </i><br>

        Sam Gronning, a licensed, professional blaster in Casper, <br>
        Wyoming with 30 years experience in explosives, told us <br>
        the Partin letter "states in very precise technical terms <br>
        what everyone in this business knows: No truck bomb of ANFO<br>
        [ammonium nitrate fuel oil] out in the open is going to cause <br>
        the kind of damage we had there" in Oklahoma City. "In 30 years <br>
        of blasting, using everything from 100 percent nitrogel to ANFO, <br>
        I've not seen anything to support that story."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;In 1947 a ship in </i><br>
<i> &gt;Texas City Texas was being loaded with paper pages filled with ammonium </i><br>
<i> &gt;nitrate  fertilizer. Somehow a fire started in the hold of the ship, the </i><br>
<i> &gt;crew then sealed the hold, apparently thinking that would smother the fire, </i><br>
<i> &gt;instead it caused so much heat and pressure that the fertilizer exploded. </i><br>
<i> &gt;People 10 miles away in Galveston were knocked to the ground, at least </i><br>
<i> &gt;600 people died and many thousands were injured.</i><br>
<p>
        Gronning notes that he recently detonated an ANFO charge more <br>
        than three times the size of the one reportedly responsible <br>
        for the Oklahoma destruction. "I set off 16,000 pounds of <br>
        ANFO and was standing upright just 1,000 feet away from <br>
        the blast," and even a bomb that size would not have <br>
        caused the destruction experienced in the April 19th <br>
        explosion, he said.<br>

<p>
The ship must have had millions of tons, and or, it created a pressure <br>
cooker effect that magnified explosive power, just as if you opened a <br>
boiling pressure cooker -- boom.<br>
