All -<br>
<p>
Today is Thanksgiving here in the US, and I thought I'd share a poem =<br>
which popped into my head last night.  It's my first "published" =<br>
work, so please be gentle and enjoy.<br>

Give thanks every day<br>
for the knowledge that, come what may,<br>
you=B9ll have at least one more chance<br>
to take a few steps in life=B9s<br>
intricate dance.<br>
<p>
Give thanks as you watch the sun rise,<br>
and rub the sleep out of your eyes.<br>
Today is a chance to get your bearing,<br>
and do some reflection on how your life<br>
is faring.<br>
<p>
Give thanks for just being alive;<br>
sow your seeds and watch them thrive.<br>
Today is a chance to assess your goals,<br>
and summon the will to pay<br>
the tolls.<br>
<p>
Give thanks for your head, your heart, and your muscle;<br>
use them to advance through life=B9s hussle.<br>
Today is a chance to strengthen them all,<br>
and hone the skills needed<br>
to heed your life=B9s call.<br>
<p>
Give thanks for your friends along the way,<br>
who=B9ve given support and known just what to say.<br>
Today is a chance to return the favor,<br>
and enhance understanding<br>
for both sides to savor.<br>
<p>
Give thanks for all this, and for all that you are;<br>
tomorrow you=B9ll look back from afar.<br>
But today is a chance to do so much more,<br>
than all the other<br>
days before.<br>
