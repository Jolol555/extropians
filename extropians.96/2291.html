(Eric)&gt;All our words and all our actions will have far more unintended<br>
<i>&gt;consequences than intended ones. I don't know about the rest of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the list, but I'm quite confident that we have no idea what we're</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing. We ought to give it a good college try anyway.</i><br>
<p>
(Robin)&gt;We know more than nothing, less than everything.  It is just as much<br>
a<br>
mistake to think we know nothing as it is to think we know everything.<br>
<i>&gt;The goal is to be well-calibrated about how much we know.  </i><br>
<p>
I agree with you Robin, but I think he said- we don't<br>
know what we are DOING- far cry from 'we  know<br>
nothing".  But I can see how it might be interpreted <br>
that way. I took another meaning from it.<br>
<p>
What we seem to not know is how far reaching our<br>
actions can be.  Or if we are accomplishing what we <br>
set out to. <br>
I think you and he are both correct.  We try to know<br>
the most we can know, set our sights on  what  we <br>
intend our "doing" to accomplish, and to measure it's probabilty and result<br>
 as objectively as possible.  <br>
