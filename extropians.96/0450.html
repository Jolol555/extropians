Your clauses in this sentence appear incompatible. How can one speak in a<br>
way which is uncompromisingly objective and yet intend to form clearly<br>
subjective feelings of repugnance? What you are suggesting is enveloping the<br>
statement of objective fact in a construct of subjective emotional influence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Take for example the following </i><br>
<i>&gt;          sentence:</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;                Blacks are more stupid than whites.</i><br>
<p>
Case in point: it should be self-evident that this statement is bound to<br>
create subjective responses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          For most people, however, the sentence seems to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;          synonymous with:</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;                I hate those bloody niggers!!!!</i><br>
<p>
Of course it is: 'stupid' is a highly emotive word. It is naive to believe<br>
it could ever form part of a statement to be interpreted objectively.<br>
    <br>
<i>&gt;          My point is that while speaking with the provocativness of </i><br>
<i>&gt;          unabashed objectivity would be appreciated by me and many </i><br>
<i>&gt;          other persons on this list...</i><br>
<p>
Maybe it would be: but you're not being unabashedly objective. Objectiveness<br>
is just as much defined by communication method as communication content.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          I think it is laudable if you accustom people to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;          offensiveness of truth, but be prepared that you may suffer </i><br>
<i>&gt;          some personal damage.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I believe, we're not just talking about personal damage,<br>
here. In the case of David Musick's post to B'Tennis we're talking about<br>
possible collateral damage to Extropianism as a whole.<br>
