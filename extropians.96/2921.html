<i>                &gt;in our universe (such as humans) to communicate with this                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;highly advanced being, who created the universe, and receive           </i><br>
<i>                &gt;some sort of assistance.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
If there is a God I certainly wouldn't count on any assistance from Him. <br>
By definition God is omnipotent, so He could have made animals in any way He <br>
wanted to, but He chooses to do it by Evolution, that is, by mutation and <br>
natural selection. A slower, crueler, more painful process I can not imagine. <br>
I can only conclude that God is a sadist who enjoys watching conscious beings <br>
suffer, so if God ever gives me some advice I intend to ignore it.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Perhaps this god has been busily forming methods of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;communicating with the intelligent creatures it helped                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;develop in its experimental universe.  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I think God should enroll at a junior college somewhere and take a few <br>
courses in communications. We can talk with our fellow creatures, you'd think <br>
an omnipotent being would be at least as good as we are at it. Anyway, if an  <br>
infinite God already existed I don't see why He'd be the slightest bit <br>
interested in the development of finite beings such as ourselves, except<br>
perhaps to make Himself feel superior. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I have no evidence for or against the God Theory or even any                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;reason why it would be useful to explain any phenomenon,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;except possibly for the fact of our existence itself.  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
If the God Theory could explain our own existence then that would be excellent <br>
evidence that it is true, but it can't do that, all it can do is kick the <br>
problem upstairs and then refuse to discuss it further. It's all very well to <br>
say that God created the universe, but that immediately suggests another<br>
question that the God Theory has no answer for.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;If there is a God, perhaps It will provide some useful and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;clear evidence.     </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
If God wanted his existence known surely an omniscient being could have <br>
thought of a way, if He's hiding, then to detect Him we'll need to outsmart <br>
God.              <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Or perhaps we are incapable of understanding such things                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;until post-Singularity?  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I don't know what He's waiting for, even pre-Singularity humans can understand <br>
the concept of "yes" or "no". So what's my opinion, does God exist? <br>
Probably not, at least not yet.<br>
