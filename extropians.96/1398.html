My discussions with Robin and Lyle were not intended to cover Starships,<br>
or<br>
even pipelines. My point about economic meltdown remains valid if we<br>
consider<br>
only the replacment of production of consumer goods with MNT<br>
manufacture.<br>
Yes, MNT designs for this class of goods are not yet available. (We can<br>
safely<br>
call this an understatement...)  Yes, design of an MNT-produced product<br>
must<br>
include the design of its associated manufacturing process.<br>
<p>
NANOSYSTEMS does in fact address the problem of communicating the<br>
process<br>
instructions to the assemblers. Your joke about batons is not far off.<br>
I got my copy of the book at the local Barnes &amp; Noble store, but you can<br>
probably get it at any large bookstore. The book takes an extremely<br>
conservative approach to MNT engineering at the detail level. It's<br>
intended<br>
to present a convincing argument that MNT violates no physical laws and<br>
that<br>
a particular class of structures is feasible. The only part of the<br>
argument<br>
that I didn't find convincing was the thermodynamics chapter. It's<br>
probably<br>
also completely valid, but I'm not competent to judge. The rest of the<br>
physics, reliability theory, statistics, computer science, and chemistry<br>
is deliberately kept simple enough to allow an intelligent layman with<br>
some<br>
background in science to form a valid opinion. This simplicity is<br>
possible<br>
because of extremely conservative assumptions and error bounds. <br>
<p>
IMO, the major problem will be in the design of the products and<br>
systems,<br>
just as Lyle claims. We differ in our respective perceptions of the<br>
degree of<br>
difficulty, and the analogies from which we reach these perspectives. I<br>
feel<br>
that the design process for the class of consumer goods in question will<br>
look a lot like the design of a computer system's hardware and software.<br>
Current computer hardware design is done using CAD tools, and software<br>
design<br>
is done with softwar development tools. These tool suites will evolve<br>
into<br>
tool suites for MNT design. Most exsting "durable goods" can be designed<br>
hierarchically, with the individual pieces designed independently and a<br>
MNT "gluing" strategy used to build the final product. Individual pieces<br>
such as sheet-metal parts can be designed very rapidly from prototype<br>
"library subroutines". Larger subassemblies (pump, motors, etc.) can be<br>
designed using specialized software packages, or an off-the-shelf design<br>
can be used. However, I suspect that most people will simply use<br>
freely-available complete designs for most goods. The designs will be<br>
available because most designers are creative people who enjoy design<br>
and<br>
who like to see their designs used.<br>
<p>
Lyle believes that it takes a car company to build a car, and that, by<br>
analogy<br>
it will take the equivalent of the human talents of the employees of<br>
that<br>
company, as they apply to the building of cars, for an MNT "factory" to<br>
build the same car. I concur, but I differ wil Lyle in that I don't<br>
think that<br>
very much of the human activity in a car company actually goes into<br>
building a<br>
car. The vast majority of the activity goes into material acquisition,<br>
accounting,<br>
management, sales and marketing, plant maintanence, and other peripheral<br>
activities. the only piece of the human activity within a car company<br>
that I<br>
think we need but don't have with MNT, is the design, which I discussed<br>
above.<br>
<p>
Lyle's other analogy is with a biologist attempting to re-engineer a<br>
tree.<br>
IMO this analogy is inappropriate because a biologist does not have the<br>
level of uderstanding of a tree that we have of MNT. Once we have the<br>
first MNT assembler, we know how to proceed. There is no equivalent for<br>
trees.<br>
