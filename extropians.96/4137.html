I agree with Max that "extropy" does not readily admit precise measurement.<br>
 Even adopting Shannon's take on entropy will probably not help much, as<br>
subsequent researchers have argued that the very definition of "information"<br>
turns out to rely on subjective mental states--not objective, measurable<br>
phenomena.  And at any rate, as Max observed, "extropy" never aimed at<br>
standing in for the more scientific notion of negentropy.<br>
<p>
Certainly, the word merits scrutiny, and its definition may benefit from<br>
refinement.  But I expect that we will have quatifiable and objective<br>
measures of "extropy" no soon than we do of "beauty" and "virtue".  (The<br>
observation by no means denigrates the utility of these words, of course.)<br>
