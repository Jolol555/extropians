Your last thought is exactly on-target: there is very little point in trying to <br>
debate Stahlman. I know, I've tried.<br>
<p>
Stahlman was indeed active on the DigitaLiberty list, until his off-topic, <br>
rambling and flame-bait posts finally got him kicked off.  This was an extreme <br>
measure for a liberty-oriented list, but well-justified in this case.  He often <br>
came off as well-read, intelligent, and utterly incapable of drawing reasonable <br>
conclusions from anything he had learned.  I hope he doesn't join this list now <br>
that ::exclude is history; according to Bill Frezza, dozens of people cited <br>
Stahlman's noise as the reason for unsubscribing from DigitaLiberty.  Also, the <br>
DemocracyNow mailing list seriously debated booting him after only two posts.<br>
<p>
Some of his posts were about CIA-driven social-control research in the 1950s, <br>
the conspiracy by Newt Gingrich and Alvin Toppler to rule the world, and why <br>
Christianity has historically been the driving force behind capitalism.  He also <br>
seems to know a bit about objectivism and libertarian philosophy.  His outlook <br>
on the latter can be summarized as Freedom=Slavery.<br>
<p>
BTW, DigitaLiberty does still exist, but it is very quiet and has frequent tech <br>
problems. Let me know if anyone wants back on the list and I'll dig up the info.<br>
