<i>&gt;Linux now supports SMP. Not perfect yet, but it will. (At least it </i><br>
<i>&gt;should, if one uses its usual dynamics for an estimate).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nevertheless: SMP is a very poor kind of parallelism. As very often, PCs </i><br>
<i>&gt;ontogeny is recapitulating the philogeny of supercomputers. Any bets, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;we will see non-SMP parallelism on an average desktop machine? (it can be </i><br>
<i>&gt;a component of a subsystem). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I say 5-7 years. Your estimates?</i><br>
<p>
I agree that eventually we will have to move away from SMP.  Too much<br>
contention in those systems to be particularly scalable.  5 years isn't such<br>
a bad estimate.  I think the limiting factor won't be hardware, but<br>
software.  OSs will have to support more truly parallel architectures before<br>
the hardware will become popular.  The first large-scale OS to adopt these<br>
architectures will probably be one of the quickly evolving ones, like Linux.<br>
<p>
The hardware is already starting to get there.  We are starting to see<br>
multiple buses becoming available on PC motherboards, and fully integrated<br>
L2 caches (like the P6) are a good start towards eliminating resource<br>
contention in multiprocessor systems.  The one thing that will take the<br>
longest is breaking out of the shared memory model.  Most of the rest of the<br>
required technology is available and supported.<br>
<p>
I am not too sure that the shared memory is really such a bad idea, in terms<br>
of efficiency.  I think what *really* needs to be improved is the general<br>
memory architecture currently used.  If they used some type of fine grained<br>
switching matrix mechanism, maybe something similar to the old Burroughs<br>
B5000 series mainframes, a lot of memory contention could be eliminated.<br>
This of course in addition to speeding up the entire memory architecture<br>
altogether.<br>
