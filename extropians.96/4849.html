<i>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That is an interesting problem. If we assume that growth currently is </i><br>
<i>&gt; technological growth, then a small elite *may* be able to continue it </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway! </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but i talked about a "to small" elite. Where the border is for a too<br>
small elite i don't know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Today we are seeing how a </i><br>
<i>&gt; relatively small group of people are able to do the industrial production</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; needed to sustain society. It might be possible that in the future a </i><br>
<i>&gt; small "elite" is enough to sustain technological growth (one might even </i><br>
<i>&gt; argue that this has always been true). </i><br>
<p>
Again it's a question about exponential growth. If the doubling rate<br>
becomes to fast, it will be very easy to end up several generations behind.<br>
If we are close to a Singularity it would be very easy to be left a LOT of<br>
generations behind. The more likely it will be that a techno elite will<br>
develop. I don't mind that elites develop. I'm just concerned that they<br>
becomes to small powerfull and rich, and leave the masses without means. <br>
The society didn't become truly rich before the masses became rich. A good<br>
example is hospitals/medical care that couldn't have been developed to the<br>
current level if there wasn't a lot of money around. So it's better to be<br>
poor today than it was to be rich a few hundred years ago. (At least in<br>
Denmark where we have free medical care.)<br>
<p>
But then again you may be right that a small elite is enough if it is<br>
powerfull enough.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree with this, but I don't think it will prevent the gap from</i><br>
forming.<br>
SNIP.  The only way to deal<br>
<i>&gt; with them is to find ways of reversign their learned helplessness. </i><br>
<p>
Yes but the only "teacher" that can follow the exponential growth of<br>
technology is technology itself.<br>
