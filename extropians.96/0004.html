Since the List has now moved to its new server (being managed by ExI's new<br>
List Administrator David McFadzean) and posts are now appearing on the<br>
archive, it seems a good time to post the Extropian Principles. Many newer<br>
subscribers may never have read them. They explain which attitudes those<br>
calling themselves "Extropians" hold in common to various degrees, and so<br>
explain the range of topics discussed on this list.<br>

THE EXTROPIAN PRINCIPLES<br>
V. 2.6<br>
(Jan 1996)<br>
=A91996 Max More, Ph.D.<br>
President, Extropy Institute<br>
<p>
<p>
EXTROPY =97 A measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality,<br>
experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth.<br>
EXTROPIANISM =97 The philosophy that seeks to increase extropy.<br>
<p>
Extropianism is a transhumanist philosophy: Like humanism, transhumanism<br>
values reason and humanity and sees no grounds for belief in unknowable,<br>
supernatural forces externally controlling our destiny, but goes further in<br>
urging us to push beyond the merely human stage of evolution. As physicist<br>
Freeman Dyson has said: "Humanity looks to me like a magnificent beginning<br>
but not the final word." Religions traditionally have provided a sense of<br>
meaning and purpose in life, but have also suppressed intelligence and<br>
stifled progress. The Extropian philosophy provides an inspiring and<br>
uplifting meaning and direction to our lives, while remaining flexible and<br>
firmly founded in science, reason, and the boundless search for improvement.<br>
<p>
1. Boundless Expansion =97 Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and<br>
effectiveness, an unlimited lifespan, and the removal of political,<br>
cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and<br>
self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and<br>
possibilities. Expanding into the universe and advancing without end.<br>
<p>
2. Self-Transformation =97 Affirming continual moral, intellectual, and<br>
physical self-improvement, through reason and critical thinking, personal<br>
responsibility, and experimentation. Seeking biological and neurological<br>
augmentation.<br>
<p>
3. Dynamic Optimism =97 Fueling dynamic action with positive expectations.<br>
Adopting a rational, action-based optimism, shunning both blind faith and<br>
stagnant pessimism.<br>
<p>
4. Intelligent Technology =97 Applying science and technology creatively to<br>
transcend "natural" limits imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and<br>
environment.<br>
<p>
5. Spontaneous Order  =97 Supporting decentralized, voluntaristic social<br>
coordination processes. Fostering tolerance, diversity, long-term thinking,<br>
personal responsibility, and individual liberty.<br>
<p>
These principles are developed below. Deeper treatments can be found in<br>
various issues of EXTROPY: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought =97<br>
Spontaneous Order in #7, Dynamic Optimism in #8, and Self-Transformation in=<br>
 #10.<br>
<p>
<p>
1. BOUNDLESS EXPANSION<br>
<p>
Extropians recognize the unique place of our species, and our opportunity to<br>
advance nature=92s evolution to new peaks. Beginning as mindless matter,=<br>
 parts<br>
of nature developed in a slow evolutionary ascendence, leading to<br>
progressively more powerful brains. Chemical reactions generated tropistic<br>
behavior, which was superseded by instinctual and Skinnerian<br>
stimulus-response behavior, and then by conscious learning and<br>
experimentation. With the advent of the conceptual awareness of humankind,<br>
the rate of advancement sharply accelerated as intelligence, technology, and<br>
the scientific method were applied to our condition. We seek to sustain and<br>
quicken this evolutionary process of expanding extropy, transcending<br>
biological and psychological limits into posthumanity.<br>
<p>
In aspiring to posthumanity, we reject natural and traditional limitations<br>
on our possibilities. We champion the rational use of science and technology<br>
to eradicate constraints on lifespan, intelligence, personal vitality,<br>
freedom, and experience. We recognize the absurdity of meekly accepting<br>
"natural" limits to our lifespans. The future will bring a graduation from<br>
Earth =97 the cradle of human and transhuman intelligence =97 and the<br>
inhabitation of the cosmos.<br>
<p>
Resource limits are not immutable. Extropians affirm a rational,<br>
market-mediated environmentalism aimed at sustaining and enhancing the<br>
conditions for our flourishing. We oppose apocalyptic environmentalism which<br>
hallucinates catastrophe, issues a stream of irresponsible doomsday<br>
predictions, and attempts to strangle our continued evolution. Intelligent<br>
management of resources and environment will be fostered by the Extropian<br>
goal of vastly extended lifespan. The market price system encourages<br>
conservation, substitution, and innovation, preventing any need for a brake<br>
on growth and progress. Migration into space will immensely enlarge the<br>
energy and resources accessible to our civilization. Extended lifespans will<br>
foster wisdom and foresight, while restraining recklessness and profligacy.<br>
=09<br>
No mysteries are sacrosanct, no limits unquestionable; the unknown will<br>
yield to the ingenious mind. We seek to understand the universe and to<br>
master reality up to and beyond any currently foreseeable limits.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. SELF-TRANSFORMATION<br>
<p>
Extropians affirm reason, critical inquiry, intellectual independence, and<br>
honesty. We reject blind faith and the passive, comfortable thinking that<br>
leads to dogma, mysticism, and conformity. Our commitment to positive<br>
self-transformation requires us to critically analyze our current beliefs,<br>
behaviors, and strategies. Extropians therefore feel proud by readily<br>
learning from error rather than by professing infallibility. We prefer<br>
analytical thought to fuzzy but comfortable delusion, empiricism to<br>
mysticism, and independent evaluation to conformity. We affirm a philosophy<br>
of life but distance ourselves from religious dogma because of its blind<br>
faith, debasement of human worth, and systematic irrationality.<br>
<p>
We seek to become better than we are, while affirming our current worth.<br>
Perpetual self-improvement =97 physical, intellectual, psychological, and<br>
ethical =97 requires us to continually re-examine our lives. Self-esteem in<br>
the present cannot mean self-satisfaction, since a probing mind can always<br>
envisage a superior self in the future. Extropians are committed to<br>
deepening their wisdom, honing their rationality, and augmenting their<br>
physical and intellectual capabilities. We choose challenge over comfort,<br>
innovation over emulation, transformation over torpor.<br>
=09<br>
Extropians are neophiles and experimentalists who track new research for<br>
more efficient means of achieving goals and who are willing to explore novel<br>
technologies of self-transformation. In our quest to advance to a posthuman<br>
stage, we rely on our own judgment, seek our own path, and reject both blind<br>
conformity and mindless rebellion. Extropians frequently diverge from the<br>
mainstream because they refuse to be chained by any dogma, whether<br>
religious, political, or intellectual. Extropians choose their values and<br>
behavior reflectively, standing firm when required but responding flexibly<br>
to new conditions.<br>
=09<br>
Personal responsibility and autonomy go hand-in-hand with<br>
self-experimentation. Extropians take responsibility for the consequences of<br>
their choices, refusing to blame others for the results of their own free<br>
actions. Experimentation and self-transformation require risks; we wish to<br>
be free to evaluate potential risks and benefits for ourselves, applying our<br>
own judgment, and assuming responsibility for the outcome. We seek neither<br>
to rule others nor to be ruled. We vigorously resist those who use the<br>
institutionalized coercion of the State to impose their judgments of the<br>
safety and effectiveness of various means of self-experimentation. Personal<br>
responsibility and self-determination are incompatible with authoritarian<br>
centralized control, which stifles the choices and spontaneous ordering of<br>
autonomous persons.<br>
=09<br>
Coercion, whether for the purported "good of the whole" or for the<br>
paternalistic protection of the individual, is unacceptable to us.<br>
Compulsion breeds ignorance and weakens the connection between personal<br>
choice and personal outcome, thereby destroying personal responsibility.<br>
Extropians are rational individualists, living by their own judgment, making<br>
reflective, informed choices, profiting from both success and shortcoming.<br>
=09<br>
As neophiles, Extropians study advanced, emerging, and future technologies<br>
for their self-transformative potential. We support biomedical research to<br>
understand and control the aging process. We examine any plausible means of<br>
conquering death, including interim measures like biostasis, and long-term<br>
possibilities such as migration of personality from biological bodies into<br>
superior embodiments ("uploading").<br>
=09<br>
We practice and plan for biological and neurological augmentation through<br>
means such as neurochemical enhancers, computers and electronic networks,<br>
General Semantics, fuzzy logic, and other guides to effective thinking,<br>
meditation and visualization techniques, accelerated learning strategies,<br>
applied cognitive psychology, and soon neural-computer integration.<br>
Shrugging off the limits imposed on us by our natural heritage, we apply the<br>
evolutionary gift of our rational, empirical intelligence, aiming to surpass<br>
the confines of our humanity.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. DYNAMIC OPTIMISM<br>
<p>
Extropians espouse a positive, dynamic, empowering attitude. Seeing no<br>
rational support for belief in a non-physical "afterlife", we seek to<br>
realize our ideals in this world. Rather than enduring an unfulfilling life<br>
sustained by a desperate longing for an illusory heaven, we direct our<br>
energies enthusiastically into moving toward our ever-evolving vision.<br>
<p>
Living vigorously, effectively, and joyfully, requires dismissing gloom,<br>
defeatism, and ingrained cultural negativism. Problems =97 technical,=<br>
 social,<br>
psychological, ecological =97 are to be acknowledged but not allowed to<br>
dominate our thinking and our direction. We respond to gloom and defeatism<br>
by exploring and exploiting new possibilities. Extropians hold an optimistic<br>
view of the future, foreseeing potent antidotes to many ancient human<br>
ailments, requiring only that we take charge and create that future. Dynamic<br>
optimism disallows passively waiting and wishing for tomorrow; it propels us<br>
exuberantly into immediate activity, confidently confronting today=92s<br>
challenges while generating more potent solutions for our future.<br>
=09<br>
We question limits others take for granted. Observing accelerating<br>
scientific and technical learning, ascending standards of living, and<br>
evolving social and moral practices, we project continuing progress. Today<br>
there are more researchers studying aging, medicine, computers,<br>
biotechnology, nanotechnology, and other enabling disciplines than in all of<br>
history. Technological and social development continue to accelerate<br>
leading, in the eyes of some of us, to a Singularity =97 a time in the=<br>
 future<br>
when everything will be so radically different from today, and changing so<br>
fast, that we cannot accurately foresee life beyond that horizon. Extropians<br>
strive to maintain the pace of progress by encouraging support for crucial<br>
research, and pioneering the implementation of its results.<br>
=09<br>
Adopting dynamic optimism means focusing on possibilities and opportunities,<br>
being alert to solutions and potentialities. It means refusing to whine<br>
about what cannot be avoided, learning from mistakes rather than dwelling on<br>
them in a victimizing, punishing manner. Dynamic optimism requires us to<br>
take the initiative, to jump up and plough into our difficulties, our<br>
actions declaring that we can achieve our goals, rather than sitting back<br>
and submerging ourselves in defeatist thinking.<br>
=09<br>
Our actions and words radiate dynamic optimism, inspiring others to excel.<br>
We are responsible for taking the initiative in spreading this invigorating<br>
optimism; sustaining and strengthening our own dynamism is more easily<br>
achieved in a mutally reinforcing environment. We stimulate optimism in<br>
others by communicating our Extropian ideas and by living our ideals.<br>
=09<br>
Dynamic optimism and passive faith are incompatible. Faith in a better<br>
future is confidence that an external force, whether God, State, or<br>
extraterrestrials, will solve our problems. Faith, or the Pollyanna/Dr.<br>
Pangloss variety of optimism, breeds passivity by promising progress as a<br>
gift bestowed on us by superior forces. But, in return for the gift, faith<br>
requires a fixed belief in and supplication to external forces, thereby<br>
creating dogmatic beliefs and irrationally rigid behavior. Dynamic optimism<br>
fosters initiative and intelligence, assuring us that we are capable of<br>
improving life through our own efforts. Opportunities and possibilities are<br>
everywhere, calling to us to seize them and to build upon them. Attaining<br>
our goals requires only that we believe in ourselves, work diligently, and<br>
be willing to revise our strategies.<br>
=09<br>
Where others see difficulties, we see challenges. Where others give up, we<br>
move forward. Where others say enough is enough, we say: Forward! Upward!<br>
Outward! We espouse personal, social, and technological evolution into ever<br>
higher forms. Extropians see too far and change too rapidly to feel future<br>
shock. Let us advance the wave of evolutionary progress.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY<br>
<p>
Extropians affirm the necessity and desirability of science and technology.<br>
We use practical methods to advance our goals of expanded intelligence,<br>
superior physical abilities, self-constitution, and immortality, rather than<br>
joining the well-trodden path of comfortable self-delusion, mysticism, and<br>
credulity. We regard science and technology as indispensable means to the<br>
evolution and achievement of our most noble values, ideals, and visions. We<br>
seek to foster these disciplined forms of intelligence, and to direct them<br>
toward eradicating the barriers to our extropian objectives, radically<br>
transforming both the internal and external conditions of existence.<br>
=09<br>
Technology is a natural extension and expression of human intellect and<br>
will, of creativity, curiosity, and imagination. We foresee and encourage<br>
the development of ever more flexible, smart, responsive technology. We will<br>
co-evolve with the products of our minds, integrating with them, finally<br>
merging with our intelligent technology in a posthuman synthesis, amplifying<br>
our abilities and extending our freedom.<br>
=09<br>
Profound technological innovation excites rather than frightens us. We<br>
welcome change, expanding our horizons, exploring new territory boldly and<br>
inventively. We favor careful and cautious development of powerful<br>
technologies, but will neither stifle evolutionary advancement nor cringe<br>
before the unfamiliar. Regarding timidity and stagnation as unworthy of us,<br>
we choose to stride valiantly into the future. Extropians therefore favor<br>
surging ahead =97 delighting in future shock =97 rather than ignobly=<br>
 stagnating<br>
or reverting to primitivism. Intelligent use of biotechnology,<br>
nanotechnology, space and other technologies, in conjunction with a free<br>
market system, can remove resource constraints and discharge environmental<br>
pressures.<br>
=09<br>
We see the coming years and decades as a time of enormous changes, changes<br>
that we can use to vastly expand our opportunities and abilities,<br>
transforming our lives for the better. This technological transformation<br>
will be accelerated by genetic engineering, life extending biosciences,<br>
intelligence intensifiers, smarter interfaces to swifter computers,<br>
neural-computer integration, virtual reality, enormous and interconnected<br>
databases, swift electronic communications, artificial intelligence,<br>
neuroscience, neural networks, artificial life, off-planet migration, and<br>
nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
<p>
5. SPONTANEOUS ORDER<br>
<p>
Extropians emphasize self-generating, organic, spontaneous orders over<br>
centrally planned, imposed orders. Both types of order have their place, but<br>
the under-appreciated spontaneous variety are crucial for our social<br>
interactions. Spontaneous orders have properties that make them especially<br>
conducive to Extropian goals and values; we see spontaneously ordering<br>
processes in many contexts, including biological evolution, the<br>
self-regulation of ecosystems, artificial life studies, memetics (the study<br>
of replicating information patterns), agoric open systems (market-like<br>
allocation of computational resources), brain function and neurocomputation.<br>
=09<br>
The principle of spontaneous order is embodied in the free market system =97=<br>
 a<br>
system that does not yet exist in a pure form. We are evolving away from<br>
tribalism, feudalism, authoritarianism, and democracy towards a polycentric<br>
system of distributed power shared among autonomous agents, their plans<br>
coordinated by the economic network. The free market allows complex<br>
institutions to develop, encourages innovation, rewards individual<br>
initiative, cultivates personal responsibility, fosters diversity, and<br>
decentralizes power. Market economies spur the technological and social<br>
progress essential to the Extropian philosophy. We have no use for the<br>
technocratic idea of central control by self-proclaimed experts. No group of<br>
experts can understand and control the endless complexity of an economy and<br>
society. Expert knowledge is best harnessed and transmitted through the<br>
superbly efficient mediation of the free market=92s price signals =97=<br>
 signals<br>
that embody more information than any person or organization could ever=<br>
 gather.<br>
=09<br>
Sustained progress and effective, rational decision-making require the<br>
diverse sources of information and differing perspectives that evolve in<br>
spontaneous orders. Centralized command of behavior constrains exploration,<br>
diversity, and dissenting opinion. Respecting spontaneous order means<br>
supporting voluntaristic, autonomy-maximizing institutions as opposed to<br>
rigidly hierarchical, authoritarian groupings with their bureaucratic<br>
structure, suppression of innovation and dissent, and smothering of<br>
individual incentives. Our understanding of spontaneous orders grounds our<br>
opposition to self-proclaimed and involuntarily imposed "authorities", and<br>
makes us skeptical of political solutions, unquestioning obedience to<br>
leaders, and inflexible hierarchies.<br>
=09<br>
Making effective use of a spontaneously ordering social system requires a<br>
degree of tolerance and self-restraint, allowing others to pursue their<br>
lives as they choose, just as we wish to be free to go our own way. Mutual<br>
progress and fulfillment will result from a cooperative and benevolent<br>
attitude towards all those who respect our rights. Tolerating diversity and<br>
disagreement requires us to maintain control of the impulses built into the<br>
human organism, and to uphold demanding standards of rational personal<br>
behavior. Extropians are guided in their actions by studying the fields of<br>
strategy, decision theory, game theory, and ethology. These reveal to us the<br>
benefits of cooperation, and encourage the long-term thinking appropriate to<br>
persons seeking an unlimited lifespan.<br>
<p>
<p>
CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
These are principles not only of belief but of action. We become transhuman<br>
only when we have fully integrated these values into our lives, when we have<br>
consciously transformed ourselves ready for the future, rising above<br>
outmoded human beliefs and behaviors. When technology allows us to<br>
reconstitute ourselves physiologically, genetically, and neurologically, we<br>
who have become transhuman will be primed to transform ourselves into<br>
posthumans =97 persons of unprecedented physical, intellectual, and<br>
psychological capacity, self-programming, potentially immortal, unlimited<br>
individuals.<br>
=09<br>
As posthumans we will both embody extropy and generate more =97 more<br>
intelligence, information, energy, vitality, experience, diversity,<br>
opportunity, and growth. The Extropian Principles serve as a codification of<br>
values helpful in guiding us into the future. These Principles continue to<br>
evolve and cannot replace independent thinking by the individual.<br>
