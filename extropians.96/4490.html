It wouldn't be hard for them to figure it out, remember I'm horribly infected<br>
with the transparency meme so I'd have no choice but to tell them I don't <br>
have any secrets. I think they'd believe me, in their society such an <br>
admission would make me look very bad, a total fool, so there is no reason <br>
I'd lie about it. If there was any doubt remaining, when they sit down to <br>
play poker with me and I immediately tell them what all my cards are, I think <br>
they would be convinced I was telling the truth and was a complete moron too.<br>

Yes.                <br>

Easier said than done. Perhaps your opponent has beaten you because he has <br>
secret information but perhaps he's smarter than you, or maybe he's just <br>
lucky, it's very hard to tell. Let me give you the best example I can <br>
think of.<br>
<p>
Just before the start of World War 2, the English Mathematician Alan Turing, <br>
certainly the most underrated genius of the 20'th century, broke the German <br>
military secret code called "ULTRA". His decoding method was too slow to be <br>
practical if done by hand, so he built the world's very first electronic <br>
digital computer to do it. Turing called his 3 thousand vacuum tube monster <br>
"Colossus" and had it finished before The Americans had even started to build <br>
ENIAC. Incredibly, Turing's computer was so much faster than the mechanical <br>
machine the Germans used to decode their own signals that Winston Churchill <br>
was able to read messages from Adolph Hitler to his generals BEFORE the <br>
German generals could. <br>
<p>
The Allies always gave the Germans a plausible theory for how they new what <br>
they knew. For example, if they knew from ULTRA exactly where a German <br>
submarine wolf pack was, before they attacked it they made sure a <br>
reconnaissance airplane got lucky and just happened to fly overhead and spot <br>
it. The Germans never figured out that their code was broken, in fact only a <br>
tiny select few knew anything about it or Turing's Colossus until the <br>
information was finely released to the public in 1975. After this became <br>
known, historians had to revise their opinion of most of the Ailed generals, <br>
they weren't quite as smart as they had thought, because with one exception, <br>
they knew every strategic move the Germans would make before they made it. <br>
The one exception was at the very end of the war at the Battle of the Bulge <br>
because the information about it was not sent over ULTRA.<br>
<p>
Turing was never honored for his war work, it was far too secret for that, <br>
the English Government decided to deal with him in a different way. Soon after <br>
the war ended, when he was no longer needed, Turing was arrested for the <br>
crime of homosexuality, a grave offense in those days. He was imprisoned and <br>
forced to received massive injections of female hormones, quacks of that era <br>
thought it cured homosexuality. Rather than continue with the torture, the <br>
poor man killed himself, the world hardly noticed. It was a quarter of a <br>
century after his death before it became widely known that he had done more <br>
to defeat Adolph Hitler than any other human on planet Earth.<br>
<p>
It's ironic that Turing's downfall was the same as Hitler's, the failure to <br>
keep a secret. The difference is that Hitler tried very hard to preserve his <br>
secrets, but Turing spent little time concealing his homosexuality. Turing <br>
was careless and it killed him, but perhaps we shouldn't judge him too <br>
harshly, he did after all have one or two other things on his mind at the <br>
time.<br>
                                   <br>

<i>                &gt;Perhaps Brin's world has people accusing each other of </i><br>
<i>                &gt;holding secrets the way people were once accused of </i><br>
<i>                &gt;witch-craft! </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't see how that could be avoided.<br>
                                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I am more than a little concerned about the lack of </i><br>
<i>                &gt;accountability under Anti-Brin as well </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
My reputation is accountable, if I write a bunch of stupid boring posts<br>
then you probably won't even bother to read anything more by "John Clark" <br>
and it wouldn't matter where I lived or what my real name is. On the other <br>
hand, If you liked a post by "John Clark" yesterday you can prove with PGP <br>
that today's post is by the same "John Clark", so you may want to read it. <br>
<p>
"Mark Twain" was just a pen name, but it had value because it had a good <br>
reputation, people knew that "Mark Twain" had written good books in the past <br>
and so they figured his next book would be good too. Nobody needed to know <br>
anything about Samuel Langhorn Clemens, he had no reputation and wasn't <br>
important, Mark Twain did and was.<br>
                                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I just like to argue. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can't very well fault you for that, nearly everyone on this list suffers <br>
from that affliction, I know I do.<br>
