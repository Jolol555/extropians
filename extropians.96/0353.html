The BrainTennis debate on HotWired regarding becoming posthuman is in full<br>
swing. According to the Associate Producer of Wired Online, the debate has<br>
generated more comments for the stage it's at than any other to date. If you<br>
haven't yet joined in on the Threads, I hope you will. Sasha Chislenko has<br>
made some excellent comments, showing where the anti-transhumanists go<br>
wrong, as has David Musick.<br>
<p>
The debate is so popular that HotWired asked Paulina and I to record a half<br>
hour verbal continuation of the debate next week. I believe other people<br>
will also be able to add questions. The result will be available from<br>
HotWired to anyone with RealAudio.<br>
<p>
I don't know how many people are hearing about transhumanism due to this<br>
debate, but I understand there are 400,000 subscribers to HotWired (and<br>
those are only the number who have formally registered, not the total number<br>
of readers).<br>
