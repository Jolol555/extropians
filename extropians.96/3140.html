Why, food and shelter, of course!  All evidence suggests (to my<br>
overly rational self, at least) that all human goals are just<br>
subgoals of our self-preserving and reproductive urges.  Even<br>
the more cerebral ones like scientific inquiry fall under this<br>
category---knowledge is power.<br>
<p>
I keep wondering what will the cravings of transhuman organisms<br>
be, for they define their goals and ultimately their relationship<br>
with the universe they live in.  Perhaps that's where the Great<br>
Filter kicks in: we transcend, figure out there really are no<br>
obstacles to our indefinite survival, and self-destruct from lack<br>
of goals.  [That's reminiscent of the behavior of "world peace"<br>
freaks, don't you think?]<br>

Oh, by the way, Ira:<br>

We *are* the Universe (an emergent phenomenon in it, that is).  By<br>
"rule the universe" you probably meant "have conscious control over<br>
transport of energy in all of known space."  I think that's a safe<br>
bet: we'll probably discard the wrath of higher forms of life as<br>
"natural disasters" or some such.<br>
