Dear Russell<br>
<p>
It was a very nice surprise to get your eMail this morning. and thanx for<br>
your very kind words about Host - I'm particularly delighted you spotted<br>
the Extropy plug :-)  You were incredibly helpful to me while I was writing<br>
the novel and I'm extremely grateful to you.  [SOME STUFF DELETED - REW]<br>
<p>
Host was published in the US in hardcover by Random House this January, and<br>
was also a Writers Guild book club main selection, and will be published in<br>
paperback in the US early in 1997.  It is being translated into some 22<br>
languages, including Japanese, Italian, Russian and was a paperback<br>
bestseller in the UK, reaching number One on some motorway and airport<br>
lists and making the top ten in many other lists.<br>
<p>
The UK paperback release was simulteneous with Host's electronic release:<br>
It was published in the UK by Penguin as the world's first electronic novel<br>
on two floppy discs and this attracted enormous publicity - I ended up<br>
doing almost 200 interviews in October and November 1994 when it was<br>
published here, including the Radio 4 morning news, The Today Programme,<br>
which is Britain's biggest radio show and we had acres of press coverage.<br>
<p>
Host is about a computer scientist who believes he could live for ever<br>
through a combination of downloading his brain into a computer and having<br>
his body frozen and did get me into a huge number of debates on the<br>
subjects of cryonics and of immortality in general, and throughout the<br>
whole period of the book's promotion, which still continues to this day, I<br>
have vigorously fought the corner for the cryonicists and for all those who<br>
believe that immortality will be achievable through science, and I have<br>
argued both on the technical platform and on the philosophical and morality<br>
ones.  I'm a firm believer that the human race should not have to accept<br>
death as inevitable.<br>
<p>
Host is being made into a four-hour miniseries for ABC television.  It will<br>
be produced by Mick Garris (who recently directed Stephen King's The Stand<br>
for ABC, and which achieved the highest ever audience rating in the US for<br>
a miniseries) and is being scripted by Preston Sturges Jnr.  There is no<br>
start date yet, but ABC hope to be in production before the end of this<br>
year.<br>
<p>

Warm regards.<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
