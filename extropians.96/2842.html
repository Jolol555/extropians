I believe that the primary reason for women being portrayed by most as <br>
the more "beautiful" gender is found in traits associated with youth.<br>
Most secondary sexual characteristics imply that they "perish" less from <br>
age than do males: lack of facial hairgrowth, smaller hands and feet,<br>
rounder (arrgh, isn't the 'b' word censored by AOL?)...<br>
<p>
These often imply characteristics of youth.  For this reason, many people <br>
find androgeny to be a "beautiful" triat of either gender.  However, this <br>
does not preclude non-youthful traits from being found beautiful, in <br>
which the "perishing" is done with character.  LIkewise, non-androgenous <br>
triats are sometimes admired for the virility they exhibit, like stout, <br>
stubbled chins. <br>
