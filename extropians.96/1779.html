I think rather than pointing out how noncapitalist systems are also<br>
exploiting, i would rather hear discussions on how, actually *how*,<br>
Libertarian legal systems will  address outright  coercion and illegal<br>
gangstyle or mafia style serfdom.  <br>
<p>
As i study libertarian philosophy, i was not surprised to learn it was based<br>
on the "homesteading" Locke philosophy, and question such a stance, not<br>
because i think it is inherantly  "wrong" but already "outmoded". <br>
Property ( especially in Europe, Japan and US) is largely already claimed,<br>
not many will be able to make an original stake and therefore it will be<br>
neccessary to redefine "privacy" and  "private", private to whom?Private from<br>
what? We will have property subdivided, owned in group purchases, rentals,<br>
huge condo-munities, offshore controls etc. A shift in such a basic<br>
foundation block may have implications shaking the very roots of the<br>
philosophy.<br>
( Homesteading could have a resurgence in offworld or undersea technologies :<br>
-) <br>
<p>
Either way,  in most of these discussions, the *concerns* which I hear are<br>
how shall we protect ourselves and others from greedy, shitty "corperate"<br>
gangs (Percieved now as mostly  *in cahoots* with the govt, getting corperate<br>
 welfare etc.).. or mafias, or "bad" people who abuse the free market. <br>
The concern is valid, because history has lots of examples of coercive<br>
tactics, gunpoint ( 1995, L.A.) used to set up sweat shops, people forced to<br>
help others gain wealth against their will( thru lying or  other types of<br>
coercion) and so forth. The principle of non coercion will be ignored by<br>
some, perhaps many, if there is no "indoctrination" - which is obviously<br>
unlibertarion, or unless we magically all suddenly become ethical. Not<br>
happening yet, but I am optimistic. : )<br>
When I endeavor to come up with solutions, and hear mostly "oh it will go<br>
away by itself" or " free market will take care of it" or , it can't be worse<br>
than it is ( which may be true, but its hardly comforting , productive or<br>
seductive ) I think it's no wonder only small percent of people will become<br>
Libertarian. There just arent enough hard plans.... how do we get there??<br>
specifically? <br>
I suggest looking into the challenge of how to create* a utopia, not MORE<br>
fingerpointing.... <br>
<p>
*Obviously working out the nitty gritty of how to prevent force and illegal,<br>
unethical worker exploitation , as well as crime control, urban safety,<br>
children's welfare, military defense  and so forth  and is a big job ahead,<br>
  our govt makes a big living off of it.  <br>
