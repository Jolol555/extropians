<i>&gt;I am a human first and a Libertarian second.  Would you, as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Libertarian, have kept the U.S. out of World War II, knowing that if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;did so the Holocaust would continue and Hitler would rule the world? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Why should your principles as a Libertarian stop at the U.S. border? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Don't the people ruled by dictators have rights too?  Shouldn't they,</i><br>
<i>&gt;too, be protected against their government?  Don't the Libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles - or any principles, taken to their logical extreme - demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;that one attempt to conquer the world?</i><br>
<p>
I think the Holocaust was a good example where there was a great number of<br>
people possessing bad memes which generally made them passive and refuse to<br>
join together to fight their enemy. The Jewish people were running the<br>
whole system which made the Germans even angrier because they were doing<br>
such an efficient job. Bad memes meant demise of a great number of people<br>
who didn't need to die but chose to.<br>

<i>&gt;I deny to those plants the right to live; I deny their products the</i><br>
<i>&gt;right to exist.  At them, I will strike.  Some may consider those plants</i><br>
<i>&gt;and chemicals their private property, and I admit that those rights may</i><br>
<i>&gt;be violated.</i><br>

The Jimson weed was growing in San Bernodino in California. Teenagers were<br>
using the hallucinogenic drug so they decided that instead of educating and<br>
allowing them to make their own choice (not condemn the drug) they decided<br>
to go around the area in an attempt to chop up every living plant when it's<br>
indigenous to the area. (An impossible feat). I think they'res something<br>
wrong with this situation.<br>
