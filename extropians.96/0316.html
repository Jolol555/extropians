<p>
This theory would also need to explain why *no* member of *any* such a<br>
society chooses to expand normally, rather than going out the 'fire<br>
exist'.  The exiting process creates an apparent supernovae, perhaps?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Um, I misunderstood you. I was thinking about a solid state civilization, </i><br>
<i>&gt;a mind ecology, a &gt;H. Since this is post-Singularity I thought we cannot </i><br>
<i>&gt;know anything about it. If this is a ecology in the Darwinian sense, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;yes, it will probably show boundless expansion.</i><br>
<p>
I see no good reason not to expect "Darwinian" natural selection to<br>
operate in a "mind ecology".  I think folks exaggerate our inability<br>
to understand "post-Singularity" events.  Evolutionary pressures to<br>
use available resources seems to me a very robust result, on a par<br>
with the second law of thermodynamics.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Sometimes I think that the "natural order" is artificial: stars are </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; But then why have we had so much success explaining astrophysical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; phenomena with simple physical processes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Good question. One possibility is that very advanced technology is </i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely ephermeral and natural-looking and hence hard to distinguish </i><br>
<i>&gt;from natural phenomena. For example, the sun might work as expected, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;the solar neutrinos are used by someone for something. Dark matter might </i><br>
<i>&gt;be large nanostructures spread across the universe, sending packets of </i><br>
<i>&gt;information as gamma ray bursts. </i><br>
<p>
I see two possibilities.  One is that the way to make maximal use of<br>
these resources is disturb them very little from their natural state.<br>
I find this possible, but a priori pretty unlikely.<br>
<p>
The other possibility is that folks are all hiding out from being<br>
destroyed by each other.  This is a theory popular with the 3 Hard SF<br>
Bs (Bear, Benford, and Brin).  I find it hard, however, to understand<br>
why it wouldn't be better to just aggressively expand to every place<br>
one could and use it to the fullest, rather than hiding in corners.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How to tell the difference between nature and technology? Technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;tends to optimize *something*, and a good guess would be (given our</i><br>
<i>&gt;current information-bias) information production or storage.  So, what</i><br>
<i>&gt;media in cosmos might be able to store or process a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;information?</i><br>
<p>
Most entropy is now in the background radiation, unless there are<br>
substantial numbers of big black holes.<br>
