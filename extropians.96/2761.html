In the "Universal Translators" thread, Michael Lorrey wrote to me, "I'm an <br>
engineer, your an<br>
artist (?)"<br>
<p>
I'm an engineer too, Mike.  I love designing things and making things and <br>
studying other people's designs.  I'm sure I don't have as much experience as <br>
you do yet, since I haven't been working at it as long as I'm guessing you <br>
have.<br>
<p>
I'm also an artist.  I create lots of different forms of expression, using <br>
lots of different kinds of materials.<br>
<p>
I'm also lots of other things. I'm a writer, a musician, a deep thinker, an <br>
athlete, an actor, a scientist, a mathematician, a technologist, a teacher, <br>
and many other things.  I enjoy working in many many areas.  In most areas, I <br>
am only a beginner now, but I am progressing quite rapidly in every field that <br>
I engage myself in.<br>
<p>
I prefer not to limit my intelligence and creativity by using them in only a <br>
few fields of endeavor.  I want to do many things and excell at everything I <br>
do.<br>
