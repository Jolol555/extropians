<p>
I never thought I would say what I am about to say.  This is something <br>
I have never talked about, indeed something I have only recently <br>
admitted to myself.  But, here goes.  <br>
<p>
I took a lot of tests when I was in school.  There was a college nearby <br>
that used us as guinea pigs.  We took a battery of tests every other year <br>
starting in the second grade.  I scored in the 99th percentile on all of <br>
them.  I wasn't a prodigy like some people here, just a normal genius.  <br>
<p>
When I was 20 I took mescaline.  I only took a small amount, not <br>
enough for a full-fledged psychedelic trip.  But I did feel some effect.  <br>
When I was 21 I took one more standardized test, given by the army.  <br>
(This was during the Vietnam war; they tested us to see if we were <br>
draftable.)  I scored in the 94th percentile on that one.  About the same <br>
time, my grades started slipping.  Lyle, the straight-A student from   <br>
day one, had lost his edge.  <br>
<p>
Then at age 23 I took LSD for the first time.  This was a full-fledged <br>
cosmic acid trip, a journey to the center of time, the sort of thing that <br>
produces a conversion experience.  After that, I *believed in* acid.  <br>
But I still had enough caution not to take too much; I took acid a total <br>
of about 20 times over the next five years.  <br>
<p>
I could still write -- both prose and computer code -- but only with <br>
great effort.  My attention span wasn't what it had been when I was <br>
younger.  Sometimes I knew something was wrong.  The analogy     <br>
that occurred to me at the time was putting a towel in a refrigerator door <br>
to keep it from closing.  That's what my mind felt like.  It wouldn't <br>
close down on anything.  But most of the time I wouldn't admit that <br>
anything was wrong, and if I did admit that something was wrong, I <br>
wouldn't draw the obvious conclusion about the cause.  <br>
<p>
I didn't get my strength back until I was in my thirties.  Ironically, <br>
it was pot that helped me put myself back together.  This of course <br>
made it even more difficult to admit that I had been an acid casualty <br>
for years.  To say anything bad about acid would be a betrayal of the <br>
psychedelic cause.  I still believed in acid, and advocated it, long after <br>
I had stopped taking it.  I even went to a Terence McKenna seminar <br>
at Esalen in 1988.  <br>
<p>
But now, looking back, the sequence of events is too obvious to deny.  <br>
<p>
This is not an antidrug sermon.  I still smoke pot.  Some of my best <br>
posts were written when I was stoned.  Some of my best ideas <br>
have come to me when I was stoned.  (The best ones don't get posted -- <br>
they are trade secrets.)  <br>
<p>
I'm just trying to be realistic about what happened to me.  I think it is <br>
possible for most people to recover from acid.  But I think it is <br>
something to be recovered from, not something that gives us strength.    <br>
I don't know of anybody whose test scores went *up* after taking acid.  <br>
I'm not saying this never happens -- all drugs affect different people in <br>
different ways -- but I never heard of it happening.  <br>
<p>
There are better paths to the center of time.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
