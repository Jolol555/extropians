The description of the drive sounds wrong to me, although I appreciate <br>
there may be more to it.<br>
Given what you say, there *would* be excess "centrifugal force" pushing <br>
towards the side of the highest velocity. But the force doing the <br>
accelerating of the masses would cause a reaction equal to this, and <br>
would in the opposite direction. Having a rotating frame of reference <br>
only makes the maths harder.<br>
<p>
I'd like to be wrong but I've seen Laithwaite, Hayasaka (sp?)  and at <br>
least one other make similar devices, all of which failed when tested <br>
away from their original rigs. Measured forces proved to be due to <br>
friction, erratic vibration and in one case, the exhaust from the model <br>
aeroplane engine powering the prototype. :-)<br>
<p>
I know you won't have made that basic a mistake, but you're up against a <br>
*very* hard problem here, at the very least.<br>
