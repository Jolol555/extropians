I didn't mean to imply that my intelligence really dropped, just that <br>
I let my math and verbal skills grow rusty as I explored other modes <br>
of experience.<br>

Perhaps the problem was that you needed to be analytical - writing <br>
prose and computer code - and the psychedlic mode of thinking was not <br>
conducive to that.<br>
<p>
Looking back through my notebooks from that time period, I see that I <br>
wrote some rather long-winded poetry and drew up some interesting <br>
conceptual diagrams, but my essays look somewhat incoherent in <br>
retrospect.<br>
<p>
&lt;I didn't get my strength back until I was in my thirties. <br>
 Ironically, it was pot that helped me put myself back together.&gt;<br>
<p>
I had a very similar experience, though I never felt that I was a <br>
casualty of drug usage, it was mostly a lack of coherent purpose from <br>
too many nihilistic memes.  Finally going to college and being <br>
determined to take up a profession after initially rejecting all of <br>
that helped to straighten me out more than anything.<br>
