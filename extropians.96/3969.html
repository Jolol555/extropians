Hmm, I think this posting certainly belongs to this list because it deals<br>
with several interesting extropian issues (and how sensitive posting<br>
personal stuff is, that is up to the person posting it).<br>
<p>
I have been thinking myself about transhuman daily life, and how to make<br>
daily life more transhuman. Many household activities are extropic, like<br>
cleaning which is just getting rid of entropy. Cooking is a definite &gt;H<br>
area, where many fields interact: the nutritional aspect (making healthy<br>
food that improves your life expectancy, CR), the hedonic aspect (it<br>
should taste and look good, and become a real experience), the practical<br>
aspect (I have learned more about managing paralell systems by cooking<br>
than from my courses in the subject) and the cultural aspect. Finding <br>
ways to enhance all these aspects is an interesting problem (nootropic <br>
spices? efficient cooking methods? symbolic food?). <br>
<p>
I wonder how many areas of our daily lives that can be improved or <br>
re-evaluated in a more transhuman direction. Being able to do practical <br>
things (and not being afraid of doing them) is a first step towards <br>
independence and personal growth. <br>
