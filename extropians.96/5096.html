Local government bodies in most large urban jurisdictions in<br>
California deliberately conspire to make it nearly impossible to<br>
obtain a CCW permit, despite the fact that this is in violation of<br>
state law. I stopped following the legal challenges because they<br>
usually end up getting wrapped in some bundle of sanctimonious red<br>
tape or other. Of course I've carried my pistol concealed, but<br>
frankly I have better things to do with my time than play games<br>
with the local protection rackets to secure their permission. I<br>
understand that this reprehensible state of affairs does not obtain<br>
in most jurisdictions in the US, but I have many criteria other<br>
than the attitudes of the local legitimized Mafia to take into<br>
account in my choice of residence.<br>
