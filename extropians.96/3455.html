Chris Hind writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was discussing the possibilities of nanotech with my father </i><br>
<i>&gt; when the idea came to my mother that in "The Book of Revelation" </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Bible it says something to the effect of "People will search </i><br>
<i>&gt; for death but death will flee from them" and she contributed that</i><br>
<i>&gt; factor to nanotech.  </i><br>
<p>
Do you mean attributed?  Anyway, to continue - <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; She's anti-nano now and shes already spread the meme to a few others </i><br>
<i>&gt; and even worse is the fact that she's the leader of a church fellowship! </i><br>
<i>&gt; Aughhh!!   She better not spread that meme any further. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Memes like this will continue to develop and we MUST STOP THEM </i><br>
<i>&gt; by throwing out counter memes.</i><br>
<p>
Calm down, Chris...   <br>
<p>
Here is a counter-meme:  <br>
<p>
The book of Revelation describes upheavals which sound very much <br>
like Artificial Life running amok.  It's a kind of grey goo scenario.  <br>
There is something called, in Greek, "therion."  This is usually <br>
translated "beast," which is a valid translation, but there are other <br>
possible translations:  it could be translated "monstrous life form" <br>
or "artificial organism" or even "advanced being."  It is an unnatural, <br>
destructive creature of some kind.  Just as the grey goo threatens to <br>
destroy everything, Christ overcomes the beast and establishes the <br>
New Jerusalem, which is described as a huge crystal.  <br>
<p>
Now, let's connect this with another idea:  The church taken as a whole <br>
is supposed to be the body of Christ.  Becoming a Christian is like <br>
being possessed.  You become a new person, and you no longer have <br>
a will of your own; you turn your will over to God.  The collection <br>
of all such persons acts together as one huge superorganism, in which <br>
Christ is the head (i.e. the mind, the part that makes decisions), <br>
and each Christian is like a finger, or some other body part.  I'm not <br>
making this up, it's standard New Testament doctrine.  <br>
<p>
So, the collection of all Christians *is* the body of Christ.  Therefore <br>
when it says "Christ" does something, it actually means the church  <br>
does something.  In other words, the church is supposed to play an <br>
active role in the Apocalypse.  You have, on the one hand, the "beast," <br>
and on the other, the body of Christ; they are both artificial organisms, <br>
and they both use nano, but one is entropic and the other is extropic.  <br>
<p>
The true church is the church that will make the Apocalypse happen, <br>
and create the New Jerusalem, as described in Revelation 21.  <br>
<p>
Once THAT meme gets started, there is no stopping it.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
