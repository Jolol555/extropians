The idea of building a lot of smaller biospheres makes a lot more <br>
sense.  There won't need to be global co-coperation between countries <br>
(which is very tedious) and the scale of engineering will be more <br>
manageable.  Every biosphere could be it's own sovereign country - <br>
regardless of size.  These could be connected with tunnels which are <br>
constructed by mutual funding of the biospheres involved.  Gathereing <br>
solar power from the outer atmosphere (and beyond) will have to wait <br>
a while 'cause the biospheres will first expand more laterally than <br>
vertically.  <br>
<p>
Asimov's Foundation novel sketch a nice picture of a planet that is <br>
5km deep in buildings - all the way around.  I've always liked time <br>
lapse photographs of plants growing, imagine watching planet earth <br>
light up and expand spreading it's tentacles to the outer reaches of <br>
the solar system and transforming all the dead matter into <br>
dynamically evolving life...   (gooseflesh up my spine :-)  )<br>
