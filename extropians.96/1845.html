This would only buy you a little time.  You really need to advance<br>
your tech as fast as possible.   Anyway, the point is if competition<br>
were this fierce, it would soon be visible, so that can't be what is<br>
going on out there now.<br>
<p>
[[Your ~10^20 (say) probes are very small. In the systems they<br>
reach, they do not engage in splashy engineering projects (above the <br>
planetary level, which is above our current detection threshold). <br>
Panspermia<br>
probes also fit this criterion. The struggles are mostly in the <br>
information<br>
realm and at the mesoscopic scale. Maybe some exceptions _are_<br>
visible: it is hard to say what sets off each and every nova, gamma ray <br>
bursters<br>
are a complete mystery, cosmic ray sources are still debated, etc.]]<br>

<i>&gt;It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the</i><br>

That could be a show stopper for any strategy, it doesn't imply that<br>
this isn't the best strategy.  <br>
<p>
[[I agree.]]<br>
<p>
And if such pulses had an arbitrary<br>
radius, that would be the end of the living universe.<br>

[[The intensity drops off as the inverse square of the distance. The <br>
amplitude <br>
may also degrade via interactions with the media.<br>
 Also,<br>
a much more far-fetched idea: a soliton that slightly increases the <br>
local<br>
speed of light, or "vacuum index of refraction", if you will,<br>
followed by another "restoration" soliton that catches up with the<br>
first at some pre-determined distance.]]<br>
