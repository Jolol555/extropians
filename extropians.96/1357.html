On 9/25/96, Sarah Marr had some comments on my post of 9/24/96.  I didn't see<br>
much worth responding to at the time, following Samuel Johnson's maxim that "It<br>
is impossible to criticize unresisting imbecility."  But, unfortunately, Mark<br>
Crosby, in his post of 9/27/96 offered this assessment of Sarah's post: "Aside<br>
from the fact that many things *do* happen at the same time (as Sarah Marr<br>
pointed out in her incisive response to Reilly)."  If her response is viewed as<br>
incisive, and if someone else thinks many things happen at the same time, then I<br>
will, altruistically, offer up some comments and suggestions of my own.<br>
<p>
Sarah Marr: &lt;If I'm right, then more than one thing can happen at any given<br>
instant of time.&gt;<br>
<p>
If two utterly contradictory events occur at the exact same time, and at the<br>
exact same place, then you must explain how there can be such a concept of truth<br>
at all.  How can there be unique history?  What kind of a rational world would<br>
you construct, that did not contain a law of non-contradiction?  Why would you<br>
expect a scientific experiment to ever be repeatable?  How could anything be<br>
intelligible at all?  Most certainly, many different things happen with<br>
frequency, but not in the same exact place, at the same exact time, this is<br>
conceptual drivel.  I didn't both send my post and not send it at the same time,<br>
I, in fact, and in truth, sent it.  Columbus didn't both discover America in<br>
1492, and vacation on the French Rivieria at the same instant.<br>
<p>
What I see here, in combination with your later comments on "feelings,"<br>
"happiness," and "toleration" (which I will address down below), I take to be<br>
the result of good dollops of scientific nihilism, historical revisionism, and<br>
cultural relativism.  Good scientists aren't really nihilists.  Confused<br>
scientists who mistake their models of random activity at the smallest scales<br>
for an ontological primitive are nihilists.  They mix up ontology with<br>
epistemology.  Scientific models built around the concept of randomness are<br>
epistemological in nature, not ontological.  Ontologically, random activity<br>
equates to nothing.  Yet here we are.  Randomness resides strictly in our brain,<br>
as a concept that has great utility to us by patching over our ignorance of<br>
causes, but could hardly make sense ontologically.<br>
<p>
I will recommend a good book to cure these conceptual diseases.  "The Killing of<br>
History:  How a Discipline is Being Murdered By Literary Critics and Social<br>
Theorists", by Keith Windschuttle (1996) was recently reviewed in the "The New<br>
Criterion" (September 1996).  Some blurbs from the review: "Having lived among<br>
the natives, Mr. Windschuttle has sampled much local fare; he knows all about<br>
curiosities like semiotics, and how they got to be that way; he understands the<br>
chief local dialects, and can discriminate nicely between structuralism and<br>
post-structuralism, deconstruction, post-colonialism, and social-constructivism;<br>
he knows the best way across the desert of Michel Foucault's 'anti-humanism' and<br>
is adept at extricating himself from the swamp of postmodern literary theory;<br>
above all, he arms his readers against the cranks, charlatans, and intellectual<br>
shysters that populate these environs:  he has sage advice for dealing with<br>
purveyors of radical skepticism and scientific relativism, as well as<br>
commonsense tips for avoiding those who pretend that history is merely a species<br>
of fiction."  IMO, rational individuals should be armed against all these forms<br>
of irrationality, such as Sarah's idea that contradictory events can occur<br>
simultaneously.<br>
<p>
Mr. Windschuttle writes: "In the 1990s, the newly dominant theorists within the<br>
humanities and social sciences assert that it is impossible to tell the truth<br>
about the past or to use history to produce knowledge in any objective sense at<br>
all.  They claim that we can only see the past through the perspective of our<br>
own culture and, hence, what we see in history are our own interests and<br>
concerns reflected back at us.  The central point upon which history was founded<br>
no longer holds:  there is no fundamental distinction any more between history<br>
and myth....  [But] the study of history is essentially a search for the truth."<br>
What these theorists say about history is also what they say about science.<br>
That's why there's an increasing amount of pseudo-science being conducted today,<br>
along with the overwhelming amount of pseudo-history.  Those who think two<br>
contradictory events can occur at the same place, and at the same time, in the<br>
words of the reviewer: "...abandon the constraints of empirical truth in the<br>
name of liberation.  But what they wind up with is not freedom but a new and<br>
more terrible servitude."  We end up with tribes of gangsters hacking each other<br>
over turf, in a will-to-power frenzy, what Mr. Windschuttle calls "charnal house<br>
politics."<br>
<p>
If truth is relative, and history is myth, then, of course, we are liberated to<br>
fabricate identities for ourselves, fabricate cultures for our fellow travelers,<br>
then demand recognition by the diverse cultures of the world at large for the<br>
legitimacy of these made-up identities and cultures, and go after those cultures<br>
who are not inclined to grant us legitimacy because to do so would be to deny<br>
their own identity and their own culture.  A big multicultural fight, concrete<br>
anarchy, meaning destruction, not abstract anarchy, meaning freedom.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Really, tolerance in practice is simply indifference.  To tolerate<br>
something is to be indifferent to it, meaning it does not threaten your person<br>
or your way of life (which is nearly inseparable from your person) and holds no<br>
interest to you.&gt;<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;A lot of tolerance involves 'putting up with' something which does<br>
affect your way of life, and which you are not indifferent to.&gt;<br>
<p>
I cannot understand this.  If something, really I should say someone, affects<br>
your life, they either a) help you, or b) hinder you.  Neutral intentions or<br>
actions have no effect on your life.  Individuals tolerate neutral intentions or<br>
actions, that is, they are indifferent to them, which is also a form of<br>
disapproval or patronization.  Individuals welcome intentions or actions which<br>
help them, this is the basis for consensual moral polities, for approval or<br>
respect, not tolerance.  Individuals fight against intentions or actions which<br>
hinder them, they do not tolerate them.  Servility is not tolerance.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;...toleration is based on the balancing of feelings of the individual, for<br>
hir own personal happiness. These are personal decisions based on personal<br>
feelings, they do not require recourse to the concept of group-worth.&gt;<br>
<p>
I am not an adherent of emotivism.  If toleration is to be held up as a virtue,<br>
as something of high worth, I cannot detect a coherent philosophy behind its<br>
foundational "feelings" as pointing to the Good.  I do know, that under a system<br>
of cultural relativism, that the similar virtue of "justice" is the avoidance of<br>
hurt feelings, and nothing more.  It certainly is not the righting of wrongs,<br>
since right and wrong don't exist, except insofar as you "feel" they do.  What's<br>
your definition of "justice," in such a "feeling" driven worldview?  Why is<br>
"happiness" important?  Does "happiness" point to the Good also?  Or is<br>
"happiness" the Good itself?  Why should we care about "feelings" or "happiness"<br>
at all?  If tolerance of others is based on "feelings," then is intolerance of<br>
others equally acceptable, as long as it is equally based on "feelings"?  Why or<br>
why not?<br>
<p>
SM:  &lt;...none of us has to agree to anything, do we?&gt;<br>
<p>
Only if we decide to opt completely out of social life.  Are we still human<br>
then?  In what sense?  This sounds like an expression of vacant freedom to me,<br>
devoid of content.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;It's not a question of a threat to the person or to one's way of life,<br>
that's too simplistic. It's to do with the nature of that threat, and a<br>
personal balancing of priorities and desires.&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm a simple kinda guy.  Desires aren't balanced, they're indulged or denied.<br>
Remember, only one thing at a time happens.  Priorities are hierarchical, not<br>
balanced at all.  Priorities always point upwards to the Good, ultimately to the<br>
highest Good.  Different conceptions of the highest Good, that is, human ideals,<br>
are quite often irreconcilable, "toleration" in such cases is conceptually<br>
incoherent, if you tolerate your destroyers, there will soon be no way for you<br>
to "honor diversity."  There is no way to produce individuals who all aim for<br>
reconcilable ideals, or harmonious worldviews, unless humanity's volitional<br>
freedom is engineered out.  This is the perennial utopian effort to reshape<br>
humanity, that has led to such devastating effects this century.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;I get the creeps any time I see the word "tolerance" any more.  The word<br>
has been badly abused by the holier-than-thou politically correct brigades, who<br>
virtually always mean "intolerance" when they use it.  Likewise, when they say<br>
"inclusive," they mean "exclusive"; when they say<br>
"multicultural," they mean "monocultural"; when they say "open-minded," they<br>
mean "closed-minded"; and when they say "diversity," they mean "perversity."&gt;<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;I don't believe you. Please give some concrete examples to prove your<br>
point.&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, since you think that it's possible for two contradictory events to occur<br>
at the same place, and at the same time, I have no clue as to what you would<br>
consider "proof" to be.  I suppose, from your emphasis on "feelings" and<br>
"happiness" above, that proof might be whatever you feel happy about.  In the<br>
presence of relative truth and mythological history, why bother with proof at<br>
all?  Why not just assert, and associate only with those who assert in harmony<br>
with you?  Do you ascribe to Richard Rorty's definition of truth, that it's<br>
whatever our peers will let us get away with?  What sources of proof do you give<br>
authority to?  To personal experience?  Well, I have personally experienced what<br>
I wrote, I understand that you have not, because you say "schools in the US are<br>
not within my sphere of knowledge," and this has been where my primary<br>
experience has been of this nasty cultural war.  I offer my personal experience<br>
as proof, but why should you believe me, especially after you've read this<br>
unflattering post, which you may not "feel happy" about?  On what basis do you<br>
grant authority to individuals, in the area of proofs?<br>
<p>
OK, personal experience is a feeble and lame source of proof, if we had to rely<br>
on personal experience, no cumulative human knowledge would be possible.  Let's<br>
turn to reflection.  The organically linked set of values encompassed by<br>
tolerance, inclusive, multicultural, open-minded, and diversity, all are derived<br>
from a worldview that says that all human ideals can be harmonized, that One<br>
World universal rational cooperation is achievable.  But this worldview is<br>
utopian and deadly, because it is false.  All human ideals are not compatible,<br>
hence, such a worldview must push its adherents into crushing or remaking all<br>
individuals with incompatible ideals.  Hence, the true set of values for those<br>
with this worldview, as opposed to the deceptive values, are intolerance,<br>
monocultural, closed-minded, and perversity.  These are the true values that the<br>
politically correct brigades of utopian do-gooders consistently show in<br>
practice, while mouthing their opposite for public relations purposes.  The<br>
individuals who have not been on the receiving end of the do-gooders' wrath and<br>
hatred, often do not understand what the big deal is.  They are sleep-walking,<br>
as we are "slouching to Gomorrah," in the words of Robert Bork.<br>
<p>
An excellent book on the conceptual development of this utopian worldview, and<br>
its inherent irrationality, is "The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the<br>
History of Ideas," by Isaiah Berlin (1990).  I don't recommend many recent<br>
history books, but this is a good one.  Berlin is a champion of polycentrism (or<br>
limited sovereignties), of individual liberty, of the uniqueness of human<br>
consciousness, and an enemy of utopianism, of relativism, of revisionism, of One<br>
Worlders.<br>
<p>
Sarah again: &lt;I don't believe theories predict what will happen, they only<br>
predict what might happen. Otherwise they wouldn't be theoretical.&gt;<br>
<p>
Theories predict, not what "might" happen, which could be anything, but what the<br>
experimenter *expects* to happen, with suitable definitions of what constitutes<br>
an observation, rules for statistical inference spelled out, confidence<br>
intervals, measurement accuracy, etc.  Otherwise, the theory would be just a big<br>
bag of nothing.<br>
<p>
Sarah again: &lt;To say observation needs a theory behind it is not true.<br>
Observation often leads to discovery: it is an error of causality to say<br>
observation _must_ have some theory behind it; it is quite possible for the<br>
theory to evolve from the observation.&gt;<br>
<p>
You cannot observe anything at all without your brain performing some perceptual<br>
categorization prior to pattern recognition.  This is automatic theorizing on<br>
the part of your brain.  Your brain categorizes on value, that is, value to you<br>
personally.  Once you have recognized a pattern, because you associatively<br>
connect your perceptual categorization to your memories, then you have made an<br>
observation that you could possibly transmit to others, if you speak a common<br>
language.  If you are doing Western science, you belong to a common moral<br>
polity, with consensual values and rules for behavior.  When you observe<br>
something in tandem with others, you must speak the same theory-laden language<br>
and come to a consensus as to what you have observed.  Scientific breakthroughs<br>
often come because individuals have unique internal values, and have unique<br>
theories or perceptual categorizations (think of qualia) even though observing<br>
the same phenomenon; thus, different patterns may be recognized, even though the<br>
external event is the same.  One event at one time, that is, not two or more<br>
contradictory events.  See my "Consciousness" review-essay in Extropy #14 for<br>
additional details and sources.<br>
