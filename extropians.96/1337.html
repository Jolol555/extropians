<p>
I think that the 'use' of ontology is as an understanding that somewhere <br>
out there lies whatever actually exists in the universe, behaving according <br>
to whatever rules it follows.  Can we be certain about any of these <br>
'facts'?  Maybe not.  But the less uncertain our knowledge is, the better <br>
our predictions get.  The only way to reduce the uncertainty of our <br>
epistemology to keep tinkering with it to more closely match ontology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To make a long story short, I think I'm saying that, in most dynamic and</i><br>
<i>&gt; novel situations, WE CANNOT 'SEE' THE FACTS DIRECTLY, only the portion</i><br>
<i>&gt; of those facts that makes it through our sensors and pattern-matching</i><br>
<i>&gt; routines.  While those portions may still be 'facts' in some ontological</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense, from a practical perspective they may amount to an illusion in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limited context with which we interpret them.</i><br>
<p>
But the objective, then, should be to fight against that possibility.  We <br>
can enhance our senses artificially, and refine our pattern-matching <br>
routines.  That's what science is - a very refined system of pattern <br>
matching, which helps us make our epistemology somewhat better than a <br>
wild guess.  There are degrees of uncertainty, and there are means of <br>
reducing uncertainty.  All I'm saying is that we should embrace those <br>
methods, rather than assuming that any uncertain understanding is equally <br>
useful.  They're not.  We can do better, and should.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While I don't quite follow it, and it's probably easy to misuse, I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ian Goddard's 'holistic logic' also makes this point that it's very</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to identify a distinct fact apart from the environment in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which it is embedded.  Yes, a tree that falls in the forest does make a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound even if we are not there to hear it; but, how can that be a fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; *for us* (except perhaps through some vague, holistic  'butterfly</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect')?</i><br>
<p>
Our ignorance of something doesn't stop it from being true.  The burden is <br>
on *us* to find out what is actually going on, whether we can do so <br>
perfectly or not.  Telling ourselves that 'reality' is only whatever we <br>
happen to think it is at the moment is not helpful.<br>
