This is what I expected.  Congratulations on the results of your efforts.<br>
Threatening to kill people is certainly farther than I would go.  For all<br>
but a few people, even going to AA meetings every day for 6 months is<br>
farther than I would go.  It looks like there's no quick fix.  Please<br>
remember not to think badly of those who don't have anyone as dedicated<br>
as you on their side.  Hm -- I guess it's also tempting to think badly of<br>
those who are in a position to help others, but aren't as dedicated as you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;needless to say, my early efforts</i><br>

<p>
So that prospective interveners may avoid some pitfalls and wastage of<br>
time and effort, could you describe some of those early efforts?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One of the big things both I an he learned were that you must</i><br>
<i>&gt;acknowledge how screwed up you are.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but until you do, no amount of someone else thinking you are will<br>
help.  Reality has to tell you (lost job, lost relationship, lost health,<br>
lost home, etc.) in no uncertain terms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We all are screwed up. Thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're a titan and invincible is just a trip to insanity.</i><br>
<p>
I read these as "nobody's perfect".  I see no advantage in painting myself<br>
as "screwed up", even though I know I can stand to make some changes in my<br>
life and attitudes.  (People who've known me for a long time will recognize<br>
_that_ as a change, and I expect most of them would consider it a change<br>
for the better.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think the biggest thing I like about transhumanism, and why I no</i><br>
<i>&gt;longer care so much for the continual "I'm a piece of shit, and there's</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing I can do about it" mentality of many AA people</i><br>
<p>
I think that comes from the religious aspect.  Christianity (at the base<br>
of the original AA, "higher power" aside) promotes the idea that you<br>
are nothing without Christ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;is the hope for actual improvment in the average human condition, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that such improvement takes the actual efforts of us as individuals.</i><br>
<p>
A good formulation of Dynamic Optimism, I'd say.  Just one more bounce<br>
on my main point:  looking down on humans, or thinking badly of them,<br>
stands in the way of improving their condition.<br>
