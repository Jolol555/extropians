<i>&gt;1)  If the research is done in secret, this substantially increases the</i><br>
<i>&gt;probability of a gray-goo or nano-dictatorship world.</i><br>
<p>
True, we just hope it doesn't come to that. Perhaps this is where the Great<br>
Filter comes in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2)  Every hour the research is delayed, another six thousand people</i><br>
<i>&gt;die.  Most of these deaths, unlike all those prior to the twentieth</i><br>
<i>&gt;century, are not merely *premature* but *unnecessary*.</i><br>
<p>
If they don't utilize the current cryonics, it's not my problem, it's their<br>
fault. Besides most of those people don't want to live longer than their<br>
normal lifespans anyways due to religious beliefs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3)  Do you have any idea how many people would die in nanowar?</i><br>
<p>
Depends. If the secret gets out like the atomic bomb did then many people<br>
would suddenly have nano as well as nano protection so it would equalize<br>
the effect. Perhaps then only 3rd worlds would be fighting with nano while<br>
the more responsible larger countries would use it as often as they use the<br>
atomic bomb which is fairly rare.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4)  Do you really want a nanowar?</i><br>
Nope<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5)  Do you want billions of innocents to die because you were careless?</i><br>
<i>&gt;6)  I thought not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;7)  So just be careful, okay?</i><br>
<p>
They've likely already got people working on it and we just have to get to<br>
it first. But I highly doubt a UN ban on all nano research would take place.<br>
