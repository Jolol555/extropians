For better or worse, I don't think climate or weather manipulation is<br>
going to be possible for quite some time.  In particular, I don't think<br>
HAARP has anything to do with weather control.  Crackpots all over the<br>
net have been accusing this project of being about everything from mind<br>
control to UFO communications.  I won't rule out the possibility that there<br>
is more to the project than is public knowledge, but there is so much<br>
garbage about HAARP out there that I view any claims about it on the net<br>
with major skepticism.<br>
<p>
The ionosphere which HAARP is apparently studying is very thin, nearly<br>
a vacuum by normal standards.  I don't think it is at all likely to be<br>
a way to control the weather.  Its electromagnetic properties are much<br>
more interesting from the point of view of communications and sensing,<br>
and I think that is enough to explain the military's interest.<br>
<p>
The thing is, weather is a big, big phenomenon.  If you want to<br>
control it by brute force, you will need hugely massive amounts of<br>
energy, many orders of magnitude (powers of 10) beyond what we can<br>
manipulate now.  Alternatively you can try to use fine tuning control,<br>
taking advantage of the chaotic dynamics of the system.  There have<br>
been a lot of demonstrations recently of controlling chaotic systems,<br>
and conceivably these ideas could apply to weather.  However for these<br>
to work you need to have a very accurate picture of your system, and<br>
you need to be able to predict where it is going in the short term,<br>
as well as where it would go if you tweak it.<br>
<p>
So we need better computers, and more importantly we need a global system<br>
for monitoring the atmosphere in detail.  These both will be along<br>
eventually, but it's going to be a while.  A spinoff from this will be<br>
very accurate weather forecasts at least over the short term.  They will<br>
probably need to be able to predict how much rain each house will get<br>
over the next 24 hours, something like that level of accuracy.  Then<br>
they can try seeing if tiny perturbations can give control.  It's going<br>
to be a big and very exciting task.<br>
<p>
Once this is achieved, conceivably weather warfare will become possible.<br>
However countermeasures may be possible as well.  Given that the enemy<br>
is using microscopic tweaks to lead to big effects based on his models,<br>
you can confound him by counter-tweaks.  This presupposes a certain amount<br>
of parity between the opponents; without that then sure, one side will<br>
have an advantage, just like with other forms of warfare.<br>
