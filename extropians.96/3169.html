There's an implicit assumption here that I'd like to question. Are<br>
there actually any reasons for us to believe that the cosmos is a<br>
closed system? I don't know of any, and I wonder why people often<br>
assume that this is the case. I know about the conservation laws,<br>
but these have only been tested with local closed systems. The<br>
reasons I can think of for believing that these laws apply mutatis<br>
mutandum to the universe as a whole considered as a single system<br>
all seem to be rather abstract and disputable epistemological<br>
principles. I'm perfectly willing to accept the conservation laws<br>
with regard to each and every conceivable closed system contained<br>
within the cosmos, but I would be interested in hearing why others<br>
choose to take the step of believing that they also apply to the<br>
cosmos as a whole, i. e. I would like to find out more about why<br>
so many people assume that the cosmos is itself a closed system.<br>
<p>
By the way, I heartily agree with you that there is considerably<br>
more to the idea of extropy than the mere minimization of entropy<br>
in some narrow thermodynamic or information-theoretic sense. For<br>
me, the connection between the idea of extropy and the more<br>
technically precise ideas of entropy has always been a metaphorical<br>
connection.<br>
