I have had low body temperature for many years, however my thyroid panel<br>
comes out normal, and using thyroid extract or T4 (Synthroid) made little<br>
difference. Recently I became aware of another treatment which is based on<br>
timed release T3. Many people have low basal temperature, normal thyroid<br>
blood panel, and wonder why they feel lousy and the doctors tell them they<br>
have no thyroid problems. <br>
<p>
If you suspect that your body temperature is low, do as follows. Get a glass<br>
thermometer, or a digital one which is consistent (reads the same when used<br>
three times in a row. Longs has one for about $7.00). Take your temperature<br>
3 hours after waking, and twice more at 3 hour intervals. If the average of<br>
these three readings is under 98.3 degrees, you might want to look into<br>
Wilson's Syndrome. If any of you out there have low temperature, let me know<br>
and I will post some more on this topic.<br>
