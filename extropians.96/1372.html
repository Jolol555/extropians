Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure it is the 2000 meme that is dangerous, it is the millennial</i><br>
<i>&gt; meme. While there are many fringe groups awaiting armageddon in 1999,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2000, 2001 or possibly 2012, there are many more people who expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; Something Big to happen soon, not necessarily at the millennium.  </i><br>
<p>
I began my last post on this subject with this statement:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree that some kind of momentous, unprecedented event is imminent.  </i><br>
<p>
But the thing is, I have always had this expectation.  Even when I was a <br>
little boy, long before I knew anything about science or computers, <br>
I had a sense of imminent doom, or imminent transformation, or <br>
some kind of momentous event.   And I'm not the only one.  People <br>
have been expecting some kind of apocalypse for thousands of years.  <br>
<p>
About 700 B.C., Isaiah wrote <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All the stars of the heavens will be dissolved </i><br>
<i>&gt; and the sky rolled up like a scroll; </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the starry host will fall </i><br>
<i>&gt; like withered leaves from the vine, </i><br>
<i>&gt; like shriveled figs from  the fig tree.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lift up your eyes to the heavens, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Look at the earth beneath; </i><br>
<i>&gt; the heavens will vanish like smoke, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the earth will wear out like a garment </i><br>
<i>&gt; and its inhabitants will die like flies... </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Behold, I will create </i><br>
<i>&gt; new heavens and a new earth. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The former things will not be remembered, </i><br>
<i>&gt; nor will they come to mind... </i><br>
<i>&gt; Never again will there be in it [the new Jerusalem] </i><br>
<i>&gt; an infant who lives but a few days, </i><br>
<i>&gt; or an old man who does not live out his years; </i><br>
<i>&gt; he who dies at a hundred </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be thought a mere youth; </i><br>
<i>&gt; he who fails to reach a hundred </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be considered accursed. </i><br>
<p>
In 40 B.C. Virgil wrote his Fourth Eclogue, a prophetic vision of <br>
a time when there is no need for trade, because every land produces <br>
everything in abundance, and there is no need to dye wool, because <br>
the sheep themselves grow wool in all colors... <br>
<p>
Maybe "The Singularity" is an archetype wired into our brains, <br>
and in every generation we try to make the facts fit our expectations.  <br>
<p>
I used to indulge myself in apocalyptic thinking.  Now I tend to <br>
maintain a certain detachment.  I watch myself having apocalyptic <br>
thoughts.  <br>
<p>
But, as Anders says, not everyone will maintain such detachment:  <br>
<i>&gt; This widespread premonition of a great upheaval/transcendence </i><br>
<i>&gt; will influence their actions ...  </i><br>
<i>&gt; And if everybody expects something to happen, it will happen - </i><br>
<i>&gt; it is just a matter of self-fulfilling prophecies. </i><br>
<p>
It is interesting to speculate on what might be accomplished <br>
if somebody set out to make use of the "self-fulfilling prophecy" <br>
phenomenon, to achieve his own purposes...   &lt;evil g&gt;  <br>
