One definition of the Singularity which may not be on the various<br>
definition pages: a poetic term to refer to &lt;blah&gt; which is no more<br>
rigorously accurate than 'sunrise' and 'sunset'.<br>

Alas, some of us may think that the strong concept of the Singularity is<br>
more cultish than general extropianism.<br>

And the easiest to doubt has predictive power.  And I think Eugene,<br>

This gives it best, I think.  However, as whether any intelligence<br>
amplification has yet happened, let alone whether it would be recursive,<br>
is not fully accepted here, this may not be a convincing argument.<br>

Oh, I guess this answers my question.  How will Bangladeshi and African<br>
peasants respond to this meme package?<br>
<p>

<p>
How about of purpose?  Okay, so I haven't been that constructive.<br>
Sorry.  A bit hard to be, when I'm leaning toward a vague idea of<br>
Universal Self-Aware Turning Machines as a refinement of the idea of<br>
Universal Turing Machines, which removes the philosophical (although not<br>
entirely the practical) point of the Singularity.<br>
<p>
And I wonder about the statement that "a human from only a few thousand<br>
years ago couldn't understand our society".  Many, perhaps most, would<br>
be terribly confused, true.  But a child from then (we assume) would be<br>
no different from our children raised now, and I suspect that there<br>
would have been some people, flexible of mind, who could have adjusted.<br>
<p>
Actually, that raises a point I hadn't thought of before.  Is the<br>
Singularity supposed to be incomprehensible to a human raised in/beyond<br>
it?  This certainly wasn't necessarily the case for Vinge -- "Original<br>
Sin" and "Just Peace" are set post-Singularity, yet the star humans<br>
actually seem more or less unaugmented.  It is their tools that don't<br>
make sense, particularly in "Original Sin".<br>

"(Dr. Chandra) had long since broken off communications with the<br>
dwindling body of philosophers who argued that computers could not<br>
really feel emotions, but only pretended to do so.<br>
 ["If you can prove to me that *you're* not pretending to be annoyed,"<br>
he had once retorted scornfully to one such critic,"I'll take you<br>
seriously." At that point, his opponent had put on a most convincing<br>
imitation of anger.]" -- _2010_<br>
