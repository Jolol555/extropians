<p>
Nice idea, but remember that the surface of the Earth isn't hard at all - <br>
our whole planet is almost liquid. My guess is that you cannot support <br>
them at all if the forces become too large, and beside the ground is <br>
constantly moving. My suggestion is to use the centrifugal force, and <br>
anchor asteroids in diamondoid beanstalks at the equator to hold up the <br>
shell. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, the first problem with this is that the sun </i><br>

<i>&gt; coating the outside of the shell with solar cells to gather energy and coating </i><br>
<i>&gt; the inner layer of the shell with lights that emit the same spectrum that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; sun does (or even a more desirable spectum, if we want).  We can also build </i><br>
<i>&gt; huge fins on the outside of the shell, which are also coated with solar </i><br>
<i>&gt; collectors, to gather even more energy, to be used however we desire.</i><br>
<p>
My suggestion is that you build a ring of solar collectors orbiting the <br>
Earth instead, which beam down microwave power - less physical strain <br>
(the fins would have to deal with gravity), and they can be extended <br>
indefinitely. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The shell could be built to be very strong, strong enough to provide us </i><br>
<i>&gt; adequate protection from very large asteroids (perhaps we could even surround </i><br>
<i>&gt; the earth with probes that watch out for and explode any large asteroids or </i><br>
<i>&gt; meteors that are approaching earth, so that the shell gets hit by many small </i><br>
<i>&gt; fragments, spread out, rather than having all of its momentum concentrated in </i><br>
<i>&gt; a small area, which could pierce the shell.)</i><br>
<p>
I don't think we can create any material that can withstand the kinetic<br>
energy of even a small asteroid - a few megatons of regolith moving at<br>
several kilometers per second will vaporize diamond just as well as water.<br>
Probes are a better system, and an even safer solution would be to go out<br>
and put ion enginers + solar cells on all dangerous asteroids to put them<br>
in safe orbits. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The shell could also be very </i><br>
<i>&gt; insulating, to keep a great deal of our heat energy inside, rather than </i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing it to be expelled into space so quickly.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, this might be a problem. The heat balance of the Earth is <br>
rather sensitive, and we should be careful not to accidentally push it to <br>
close to a runaway greenhouse effect that would turn it to a new Venus.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For all these biosphere shells, we need lots of materials.  We can get them </i><br>
<i>&gt; from the earth and from other sources, such as the asteroid belt, the moon.  I </i><br>
<i>&gt; have nothing against taking apart mercury or venus or any of the other planets </i><br>
<i>&gt; and using them also.  Eventually, we could keep taking material from the crust </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the earth to build new biosphere levels, use the heat energy of the lower </i><br>
<i>&gt; layers, and as they cool off, use that material to build more shells and </i><br>
<i>&gt; continue working in until the entire earth is turned into one huge, </i><br>
<i>&gt; multi-leveled, life-filled starship.  </i><br>
<p>
A beautiful idea. But I think it would be much, much easier to build a <br>
Dyson shell instead - many freely orbiting shells instead of one <br>
Earth-onion. The only big advantage I can see with the onion is that you <br>
get gravity for free - but that makes the engineering much harder (not to <br>
mention the risks for a disastrous accident - "Australia crashes, film <br>
at 11"). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm still trying to figure out what the gravitational pull would be like in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the center-most layers, since they would pretty much be surrounded with lots </i><br>
<i>&gt; of mass.  I'm thinking that the gravitational effect would be effectively </i><br>
<i>&gt; cancelled out down there since any mass in there would be getting pulled </i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly the same amount in every direction.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the amount of gravity at a point inside a spherical mass only <br>
depends on the mass inside the point. It might be worth noting that the <br>
overall density of the Earth would become lower as the shells were built, <br>
so 1G fans would have to move outwards. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There was a thread going where someone was saying the life would transform </i><br>
<i>&gt; itself into a neutron star and just sit where it was and compute away, not </i><br>
<i>&gt; sending out any probes because they would be too costly.  It may not send out </i><br>
<i>&gt; probes, but I don't see why it wouldn't propell itself around to various star </i><br>
<i>&gt; systems and grab up all the matter and energy there.  Certainly *that* would </i><br>
<i>&gt; be cost-effective.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the trouble is that to a neutron-star intelligence, one second would<br>
be a very, very long time. So even if it could get to other places very<br>
quickly from our perspective, it would take forever in the view of the<br>
being. Would you go somewhere if the journey took a few billion years, <br>
even if you were immortal? <br>
<p>
Another reason they would not want to rush around is the fact that you<br>
cannot extend a neutron star indefinitely, beyond a certain mass it will<br>
become a black hole (which might be a way to take a short-cut to the Omega<br>
Point if you know what you are doing, or just a very unusual way of<br>
suicide). You can cheat this by using energy to keep the star stable and<br>
extending it (not unlike the onion scenario above, but this time at<br>
nuclear densities and with extremely high energies), but the demands seem<br>
to go up very steeply. My guess is that the really big intelligences have<br>
to guzzle energy so fast that they cannot move, and are surrounded by huge<br>
instalations to support them. <br>
<p>
I like this kind of speculation. <br>
