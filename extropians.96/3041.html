Would you believe a missile that lacks explosive materials? [Bracketed <br>

[The following is in part a conversation in which anonymity on yours <br>
truly part contributed to this posting made public weeks ago...]<br>
<p>
        It has been discussed by members of my group of anonymous friends <br>
that a definate possibility exists that there was a StarWars test being <br>
conducted at that time, and the termination of flight 800 was as a result <br>
of a rogue smart-rock or brilliant-pebble! [Our conversation centered on <br>
that all intent was accidental at the beginning - do not forget this <br>
point that such an accident would be considerd a breach of security!]<br>
<p>
        For those of you who don't know this technology, they are <br>
orbiting devices that are in essence, "kinetic energy weapons".  They <br>
literally smash themselves into the target, moving at hypersonic speeds, <br>
and thus destroy the target.  Such weapons were developed as <br>
anti-ballistic missile weapons (abm) and anti-multiple-reentry-vehicle <br>
weapons (amrv). [This is over ten years ago mind you, it is more advanced <br>
now in the 1990's and do not forget the proximity of Brookhaven!]<br>
<p>
        The secenerio would be thus, a smart rock or brilliant pebble<br>
entered the atmosphere from space, and accidentally tracked the wrong<br>
target.  Smart rocks and brilliant pebbles are both set up with remote<br>
arming and targetting capabilities, however during ion burn (ionization<br>
during reentry) communication with the device is impossible, therefore an <br>
abort command could not be sent in time.  A meteor, but a MAN-MADE <br>
meteor! <br>
<p>
        If this story is correct, the USA has just demonstrated AIR<br>
SUPERIORITY over every air-force, every nation, around the world.  If <br>
this is true, and this is what happened, the US military can target and<br>
eliminate, from space, any aircraft which is airborne, anywhere,<br>
instantly.  The reprocussions of this information is astounding! [This <br>
may explain the lack of resolution and military participation...]<br>
<p>
        As the story unfolds, please keep this information in mind as a<br>
possible scenerio, as the resultant cover-up will be easier to identify <br>
if all the possibilities are widely known.  Only time will tell.........sq<br>

Since this discussion military minded (pro as a matter of fact) writers 
have said they do not believe this at all but wished we had such a 
capability nonetheless.  What a response considering that 10 years have 
passed since the original Star Wars technology brouhaha has passed.  The 
flares often cited by the witnesses are of the the thermal kind used when 
a rogue sidewinder goes after one of our own planes and is a somewhat low 
in tactical response success measure seen before in similiar occasions.
<p>
Every day that passes seems to make the Star Wars accidental test result 
more plausible and that TOTAL AIR SUPERIORITY is actually in the hands of 
the military now! The blanket of secrecy is maintained to reduce the 
commercial impact to our own military exports overseas!
