On Aug 22, 10:43pm, Max More wrote this (quoted with "&gt;"):<br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Host - an extropian novel</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually I'm not sure it's an extropian novel yet, since I've only read a</i><br>
<i>&gt; quarter way through. But it certainly presents cryonics and uploading ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; very accurately and sympathetically. The author, Peter James, obviously did</i><br>
<i>&gt; considerable research, consulting with the Alcor Foundation, and most of you</i><br>
<i>&gt; will recognize several names among the acknowledgments, including - on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list - Marvin Minsky (if he's still reading the list) and Russell Whitaker.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I was _wondering_ when this book would make it to the American market!<br>
I proofread and commented on a section of the draft involving cryonics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't help like a book with the following paragraph. The context: Our</i><br>
<i>&gt; hero, uploading researcher, brilliant scientist Prof. Joe Messenger, has</i><br>
<i>&gt; returned to his lab in England from Los Angeles, and is opening his</i><br>
<i>&gt; accumulated mail:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
A little personal background on this:<br>
<p>
Peter James contacted me about 4 years ago on this, when I was living<br>
in London, as I had some (limited) previous experience on Alcor's<br>
suspension and transport teams.  He expressed that he would be visiting<br>
Alcor's U.S. facilities, which at that time were still in Riverside,<br>
California.  After long conversation, I came to the conclusion that<br>
Peter was sincere about the depth of his research.<br>
<p>
I was not disappointed in my supposition.  The many manuscript pages<br>
on which I commented dealt well with their subject matter, especially<br>
given the (somewhat thinly veiled) transition to fiction.<br>
<p>
I had the pleasure of discussing this further over a Christmas dinner<br>
held by Alcor UK principal Alan Sinlcair, at his seaside Eastbourne hotel,<br>
at which Peter was present.  A genuinely nice guy, with an active mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "He cheered a little as he came across one that bore the frank of one of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; publishers, and might contain reviews of his most recent book, The Computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; That Loved Ben-Hur. He slit open the envelope and was pleased to see a group</i><br>
<i>&gt; of clippings: an interview he'd done with the Guardian; a review in New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scientist; a more lengthy review in The Sunday Times, which he scanned and</i><br>
<i>&gt; was reasonably happy with, even though the reviewer appeared to have totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; missed the fundamental point of the book. And there was what looked like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rave write-up in a small California magazine he much admired, called</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropy, which pleased him more than anything."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Peter had enjoyed *Extropy*, and had told me he would be writing a<br>
mention of it into the novel.  Now I really _must_ lay my hands on a copy,<br>
as I haven't read the entire work, just the cryonics-related sections.<br>
<p>
By the way, as I didn't have Peter's email address, I did an<br>
Alta Vista search on keywords '+"Peter James" book +Host' and got this<br>
interesting link as hit #1:<br>
<p>
'Host', by Peter James - The Electronic Book<br>
<a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/casa/host.html">http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/casa/host.html</a><br>
<p>
According to that page, the U.S. paper version appeared December 1995.<br>
<p>
An excerpt from that URL:<br>
<p>
"The electronic version of Host allows the reader to call up<br>
 cross references which include the author's research notes, audio and<br>
 video clips, photographs, illustrations and definitions of<br>
 scientific terms. The text is therefore just part of a much wider<br>
 software package.<br>
<p>
   Electronic Host includes:<br>
<p>
     The full text of the novel<br>
     Hot-key words which bring up all the back-up research conducted<br>
          by the author in writing the novel<br>
     A quicktime video of Peter James introducing the novel<br>
     An audio epilogue featuring Peter James explaining developments<br>
          since the novel. "<br>
<p>
Very interesting!  Of course, it's not a _web_ version, but rather,<br>
strangely, a HyperCard version.  I hope to see a full-blown version<br>
for the WWW sometime, in similar fashion to:<br>
<p>
"Engines of Creation", K. Eric Drexler, full text:<br>
<a href="http://reality.sgi.com/whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/">http://reality.sgi.com/whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/</a><br>
<p>
I'm copying this to Peter, whose address seems to be 'scary@pavilion.co.uk',<br>
from what I can gather from my Alta Vista search.<br>
<p>
Some other web resources apropos to this, mostly reviews and/or announcements:<br>

"Host, a two-part mini-series in development at ABC to be directed and<br>
     produced by Garris. Based on the novel by Peter James, the screenplay is<br>
by<br>
     Preston Sturges. Frank Von Zerneck and Robert Sertner also produce."<br>
<p>
Yow!  The first I've heard of _this_!  I'm copying Peter - presuming<br>
I have his correct email address, to see what's up here.<br>
<p>
Peter: hi there!  I'm copying you on a discussion thread started by<br>
Max More (maxmore@primenet.com) on the (now public) Extropians mailing<br>
list, extropians@extropy.org.  Please feel free to join us by dropping<br>
