 Asking politicians to control the singularity doesn't sound passive<br>
to me. (I didn't mean to imply that the motivation would be constructive<br>
- I can easily imagine a race to be first at world conquest).<br>
 Since people have good reasons to be scared by the singularity meme,<br>
and it's harder to spread the government-is-dangerous meme than to<br>
spread the singularity meme, people should at very least heed Fred's<br>
warning about the dangers of poorly thought out memetic engineering,<br>
and should maybe even discourage the spread of the singularity meme.<br>
