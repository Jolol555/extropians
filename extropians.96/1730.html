[[In The Great Filter, 9-15-96(?) version, Robin Hanson writes:]]<br>
<p>
..For example, while one can imagine predatory probes sent to search <br>
and<br>
destroy other life [Brin 83], it is harder to understand why such<br>
probes would not also aggressively colonize the systems they visited,<br>
if such colonization were cheap.  Aggressive colonization would give<br>
them all the more probes to work with, and deny resources to<br>
competitors.  If this colonization effort could hide its origins from<br>
those who might retaliate, what would they have to lose?<br>
<p>
[[Hiding its origins may require forgetting them. If this is the case, <br>
then <br>
colonization becomes a pointless exercise. Denying resources requires <br>
an <br>
a priori evaluation of the potential competitor’s capabilities, which <br>
probably<br>
 is not possible in practice.<br>
<i>&gt;From another side, one feature of Superintelligence is the ability to </i><br>
merge<br>
 and re-synthesize its/themselves. This feature alone may render <br>
current <br>
social theory inapplicable. ]]<br>
<p>
Finally, we expect advanced life to substantially disturb the places<br>
it colonizes.  ...  And unless ideal<br>
structures always either closely mimic natural appearances or are<br>
effectively invisible, we expect advanced life to make visible<br>
changes. <br>
 <br>
[[Visible changes are an invitation for destruction.]]<br>
<p>
If such advanced life had substantially colonized our planet, we would<br>
know it by now.<br>
<p>
[[Unless we are it, courtesy of panspermia.]]<br>
<p>
One possibility is that fast space travel and colonization between<br>
stars and galaxies is much harder than it looks, and effectively<br>
impossible, even for nanotech-based machine intelligence.  The<br>
interstellar medium, for example, may be much harsher than we realize.<br>
<p>
[[The least understood component of the medium seems to be the density <br>
and distribution of dust grains, rocks, and planet-size objects (some <br>
progress<br>
 has been made on this very recently). One method of countering this <br>
obstacle <br>
is to blast clear corridors ahead of the probes.]]<br>
<p>
This would suggest we have good chances of surviving, but little<br>
prospect of leaving our solar system at any substantial speed.  The<br>
slower the maximum speed, the smaller is the Great Filter that needs<br>
to be explained.<br>
<p>
[[I don’t think this changes the equation much- an interplanetary <br>
civilization can<br>
 still generate enough anomalous activity to be noticeable. The time <br>
required for<br>
 their early signals to reach us would always be less than the time <br>
required for<br>
 signals from their colonized star systems, again assuming no FTL <br>
travel.<br>
The maximum speed for atomically structured matter may be (depending on <br>
shielding, <br>
interstellar medium density, self-repair speed, etc.) much less than <br>
the maximum<br>
speed for relativistic bombs and beams. It is certainly less than the <br>
speed-of-light <br>
weapons, such aselectromagnetic, gravitational wave, other types of <br>
Spacetime or <br>
fundamental constant distortion pulses, and such.<br>
Nuclear holocaust is only the introduction to the concept of <br>
intelligently guided, instant <br>
and total annihilation. One lesson has been that offense (first strike) <br>
is always easier than<br>
 defense, indeed a defense may be effectively impossible. If Mutually <br>
Assured <br>
Destruction was, instead, Unilaterally Assured Destruction, as it would <br>
be if your <br>
potential enemies lived on other worlds, then first strike takes on a <br>
fresh appeal. For <br>
instance, a  few kilograms of matter, launched at our planet from <br>
anywhere in the galaxy <br>
at  very near the speed of light, would suffice to bomb us back to the <br>
{{Precambrian}}<br>
 Age. The early warning interval can be dialed down to a fraction of a <br>
second, if so <br>
desired.<br>
It wasn’t mentioned in the Starseed/Launcher articles,<br>
<a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb">http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb</a><br>
 but  a scaled up version of  this kind of device can serve as a low profile<br>
world-buster. The website is rather popular at the national labs.]]<br>
<p>
..First, large-scale engineering such as orbiting solar collectors <br>
made<br>
from asteroids, Dyson spheres, and stellar disassembling might be<br>
effectively impossible, explaining why nearby stars look so natural.<br>
<p>
[[It does seem to be well within the realm of present day engineering<br>
practice to build structures in space large enough to downshift the <br>
Solar<br>
 spectrum.]]<br>
<p>
Second, structures that best use such resources might happen to almost<br>
always preserve natural spectra and other appearances.<br>
<p>
[[It might be wise to actively ensure that one’s constructs are well <br>
camouflaged.]]<br>
<p>
..Similarly, Papagiannis claims that "those that manage to overcome<br>
their innate tendencies toward continuous material growth and replace<br>
them with non-material goals will be the only ones to survive this<br>
crisis," implying a galaxy "populated by stable highly ethical and<br>
spiritual civilizations"  [Papagiannis 84].<br>
<p>
[[Whatever that means. Maybe simply attributing caution to these<br>
 imagined civilizations would suffice.]]<br>
<p>
And Stephenson claims that<br>
"for a truly advanced intelligence the drive for quality rather than<br>
redundant quantity would be paramount" [Stephenson 82].<br>
<p>
[[There may be practical upper limits on the size of a (self  aware)<br>
 computer, beyond whicha high power function of signal propagation<br>
 speed, OS complexity, etc. diminishesor even reverses the gains in<br>
 computational power. Gravitational limits also come into play, long<br>
before a “Jupiter-size brain” is reached.<br>
 A superintelligencemay find at some point it doesn’t want to get any<br>
bigger.This point may be physically small.  Sending clones of itself to <br>
o<br>
ther star systems would not help its realtime crunching at all.]]<br>
<p>
..  The point is that in general the creatures whose purposes lead to <br>
the <br>
most reproduction end up dominating the future. <br>
<p>
[[This an argument for quantity over quality. Since viri and bacteria <br>
reproduce the fastest and the mostest, do they therefore “dominate”?]]<br>
<p>
Conclusion<br>
<p>
No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system<br>
or systems nearby. <br>
<p>
[[True.]]<br>
<p>
Thus among a billion trillion stars in our past<br>
universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we<br>
may soon reach.<br>
<p>
[[But I am not sure this follows.]]<br>
