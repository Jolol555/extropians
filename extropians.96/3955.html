About a week ago, Twirlip of Greymist posted:<br>
<p>
"And why should the Meaning of Life be observer-independent?  Meaning of whose <br>
life?  My meaning of a chicken's life is to feed me.<br>
<p>
(How many vegetarians on the list?  How many for reasons other than health?) "<br>
<p>
This got me thinking about vegetarianism and what reasons, if any, there are <br>
for not eating animals, other than for health reasons.  Most specifically, I <br>
was looking for any "ethical" reasons for not eating animals.  Is it "wrong" <br>
to eat animals?  This prompts more thinking of why we consider *anything* to <br>
be wrong.  Perhaps the idea of "wrong" could be translated into "interferes <br>
with my goals."  Certainly someone injuring my body or killing it would seem <br>
"wrong" to me, because it interferes with my goals to remain living and as <br>
uninjured as possible.  But what about me hurting other people?  If they are <br>
people who I may wish to trade with, which would help me achieve my goals, it <br>
would be "wrong" (in the goal-interference sense) for me to injure them or do <br>
anything to them to cause them to perform for me in a degraded manner.  But <br>
what about people whom I have no dealings with?  If they are capable of <br>
hurting me or interfering with my goals in other ways, I certainly wouldn't <br>
want to provoke them to do that; creating enemies is not in my best interests. <br>
 But what if they are defenseless and powerless?  Then why should I care about <br>
them?  Perhaps driving them off their land or even killing them would actually <br>
help me achieve certain goals.  Would it be "wrong" to do then?  Certainly not <br>
in a goal-interference sense, since the murdering is helping me achieve my <br>
goals.  But are there any realistic ethical concerns besides goal attainment?  <br>
I don't know.  This would be interesting to discuss.<br>
<p>
I was also thinking about the idea of farming humans to eat.  Humans are <br>
expensive to feed, and they take several years to mature, but if someone <br>
really enjoyed human meat, is there anything wrong with farming them?  One <br>
might say it's a waste of mental abilities and that the humans could be used <br>
for better things than food, but that is nonsense, since there are plenty of <br>
women who can bear as many children as we need to perform tasks which require <br>
mental abilities.  Hell, we could even lobotomize the ones we farm so they <br>
aren't so difficult to deal with.  They would be our property, after all, and <br>
we would be raising them for the purpose of being eaten.  In a goal-attainment <br>
sense, farming humans for food is not "wrong".  But why does it feel wrong?  <br>
And why do many people, who would think it abominable to farm humans have no <br>
qualms about farming other animals?  It is not obvious to me that there is any <br>
fundamental difference between farming humans for food and farming other <br>
animals for food.  If I consider one "wrong", I have a difficult time not <br>
considering the other "wrong" also.<br>
<p>
Also, is there really anything "wrong" with enslaving women to bear children <br>
to raise for various purposes?  If they are lobotomized, they will probably go <br>
along with it willingly enough.  Is there really anything "wrong" with slavery <br>
in general?  Why?  Certainly, for many things, it is not cost-effective to use <br>
slaves, because the equipment is expensive and requires too many advanced <br>
skills, but is there anything "wrong" with enslaving humans, in general?  <br>
<p>
Now, I'm certainly not advocating any of these activities, but I think it's <br>
important to think about and discuss why we do or don't think various <br>
activities are "wrong".  Is it possible to have a system of "rational ethics"? <br>
 Would it be based totally on achieving one's goals, or is there more to <br>
ethics than that?<br>
