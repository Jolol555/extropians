<i>&gt; &gt;Effective communication is very difficult to achieve between humans.  &gt;It</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         I think a lot of communication stems from assumption.  Assumption is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a primarily human trait that enables us to make a judgment without hearing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole situation.  This realization was quite apparent for me yesterday after</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unfortunate car accident on my behalf.  Anyhow, I believe that assumtion</i><br>
<i>&gt; is one of the biggest flaws of human language.  Once someone makes an</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumption, that assumption will eventually turn into what that person sees</i><br>
<i>&gt; as true.  For example, a person passing by the scene of my accident might</i><br>
<i>&gt; say "He must have been going too fast around that turn." when truly, that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the case as all.  That person could go home and tell his\her family</i><br>
<i>&gt; about how someone was "...going too fast down Nash Street".  That is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective communication.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         What *is* effective communication is fact-based discussion.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; person [mentioned above] who saw my car after the crash was to find out</i><br>
<i>&gt; *exactly* what happened, then he\she could effectively tell his\her</i><br>
<i>&gt; family...or whoever truthfully.  However, if humans were to use fact-based</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion all the time, there would be a tremendous lack of creativity in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the human race.  We're back where we started.  What exactly is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of 'effective communication'?  Sure, fact-based discussion is</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective...but it gets very boring.  There has to be some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; equilibrium between fact and filler.  There must be some way to say what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to say while still keeping some sense of 'being human' within our</i><br>
<i>&gt; words.  Any help or enlightenment as to *how* would be appreciated!  :~)</i><br>

Yes, one of the root rules with diplomacy is to never assume anything.<br>
You can only go on the facts, and what is explicitly stated.  While<br>
ordinary humans are rather sloppy in their communication, as they prefer<br>
to be lazy with their language, and draw all sorts of perceptions based<br>
on what their own agenda is, diplomats are highly trained in precise <br>
communication.  Whether they actually use it is another thing. One of<br>
the big problems in diplomacy is the fact that so many political fund<br>
contributors get appointed to ambassadorships without the requisite<br>
training.  In any interstellar mission, I would expect that there would<br>
be a team of people trained in sociology, diplomacy, semantics, etc. on<br>
board in case of just such an encounter. Anyone who makes it to space is<br>
also more likely to be highly educated versus the average bloke. This is<br>
unlike the adventurers during the age of discovery like Columbus,<br>
Cortez, etc. who were more interested in wealth than communication, and<br>
were typically illiterate as well.<br>
