<p>
IAN: Of course, as facts prove, you require ad hominem to <br>
bolster your case, I'll try to stick with facts and logic. I <br>
realize there's a degree of "joshing" here, but only a degree.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Funny that you claim the mantle of "skeptical inquiry."  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: So you suggest that questioning the govt and the media, which <br>
mindlessly relays the govt's news feed, is not skeptical inquiry? Perhaps<br>
proper skepticism is to be directed only at those who question authority.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I remain skeptical about the Navy missile theory.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: So do I, but I think evidence weighs strongly in that direction, <br>
mostly toward a missile. My chief concern here is why the Navy is so <br>
quickly exonerated. I'd like to encourage people to question authority,<br>
which means don't simply believe everything authoritarian figures say.<br>
Rather than encouraging that, you smear such primary skepticism as<br>
mental illness, that's a vicious aggression against skeptical inquiry.<br>
<p>
I've never said "the Navy did it." I believe 90% a missile did it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I don't think the issue is whether one of us is skeptical and the </i><br>
<i> &gt; other is not, I think the issue is what each of us thinks is a proper </i><br>
<i> &gt; target of skepticism.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Agreed. I question authority, it seems you mostly question <br>
those who question authority, which is fine, so long as we don't <br>
resort to the nonlogical method of ad hominem.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;While Navy Admiral Edward Kristensen left the door open a crack -- properly</i><br>
<i> &gt;so, as he making statements based on what his staff tells him -- it is now</i><br>
<i> &gt;clear that Salinger is the intellectually dishonest scoundrel that (ahem) I</i><br>
<i> &gt;suspected.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: He's a scoundrel because he has documents the GovtMedia does not <br>
like?? Forget the fact that these documents, if they are nothing more <br>
than the internet document, have not, to my knwoledge, been disproven <br>
in any fashion other than that they were anonymous and that the USN <br>
says, "we weren't there." If the authorities say X is true, then X <br>
is true and anyone who says otherwise is an "intellectually dis-<br>
honest scoundrel." I reject that thinking as servile.<br>
<p>
Where's your proof that the internet document is false? I just, in the <br>
last post, presented evidence that the key feature of disproving it, <br>
that area W-105 is not a missile testing area, is compromised by the <br>
USN dude saying the area is "not typically used for missile training."<br>
That does not prove the Navy did it, but it leaves the door open on<br>
the validity of the document. So where's your assumed disproof?<br>
