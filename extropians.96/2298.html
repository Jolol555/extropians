        This is the first post I have made in a while, due to the lack of<br>
[what I see as] intelligent and relevant &gt;H conversation a.k.a: noise.<br>
Anyhow, I agree with what Eric is alluding to.  I think that this principle<br>
is probably the most open to interpretation of the five.  There needs to be<br>
a balance between dynamic optimism and progress enacted (best dope it<br>
so???).  At *any* cost, we must prevent dynamic optimism from becoming<br>
'wishful thinking'.  Make dreams --lofty or mere-- of an extropian nature<br>
into reality.  There is a quote by George Bernard Shaw, and though the exact<br>
words of it escape me, this is its gist: "The men who dream at night do just<br>
that --dream, but the men who dream at day are the ones who can turn their<br>
dreams into reality."  I hope that all on this list dream in the day.  Seek<br>
solutions, don't just dream about them.<br>
