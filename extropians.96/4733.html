<i>&gt;Human behavior is shaped by the technology that is used.</i><br>
<p>
Old men in suits don't shape our world, technology does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;just look at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the past few decades. Living at the brink of nuclear extinction for so</i><br>
<i>&gt;long has had enough of an impact to make people really see the</i><br>
<i>&gt;usefullness of worldwide peaceful cooperation as opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;imperialistic rivalry. This is one of the greatest behavioral changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever and it happened right under your nose.</i><br>
<p>
We "perfected" the Weapon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We extropian transhumanists are as individuals becoming more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolved behaviorally compared to people around us who have not been</i><br>
<i>&gt;associated as we have due to the amount we have steeped ourselves in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology of the internet compared to the average person.</i><br>
<p>
We Extropians are riding the crest of Evolution. We are leading the Future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Living up here in the sticks, I find myself day by day becoming less and</i><br>
less able<br>
<i>&gt;to relate to the people in my community, as they are less and less able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to comprehend the sort of concepts that you and I take for granted as</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious.</i><br>
<p>
Ahh, this is why the extropians which wish to spread the memes the farthest<br>
should conceal themselves in conformity waiting for the perfect time to<br>
attack and spit out an optimistic, libertarian, or individuality meme.<br>
People take change a little at a time but can be pushed a little. Also I<br>
see the problem of being less able to relate to people as a problem which<br>
could become quite serious in an uploaded world. What happens when you<br>
recode yourself completely and can't communicate with others?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;will occur on a computer, and individuals who have never seen a digital</i><br>
<i>&gt;watch.</i><br>
<p>
I'll simply be happy when noone knows what an analog watch is.<br>
<p>
"You cannot discover new oceans, unless you have the courage<br>
 to lose sight of the shore"<br>
