Dyson showed that if the universe is open there would always be a time when <br>
life could exist, but that's not immortality because it would not be possible <br>
for the universe to perform an infinite number of calculations, and so there <br>
would  not be an infinite amount of subjective time, even if objectively <br>
there is an infinite amount of it. If the universe is open there would an<br>
infinite amount of space, but there would be an upper bound on the amount of <br>
energy and on the amount of momentum in the universe. <br>
                       <br>
You can't describe a system just by specifying it's configuration space, <br>
saying where all the particles in it are, you must also specify what the  <br>
momentum of each particle is, this is the Phase Space and is a measure of the <br>
complexity of a system. According to General Relativity, the size of the<br>
universe's Phase Space is proportional to the velocity it is expanding or <br>
contracting at, gravity gets stronger when things get closer together and  <br>
it's always attractive, so in the Big Crunch the velocity of the collapse <br>
will keep getting faster and faster without limit.   <br>
                       <br>
In the Big Crunch, space goes to zero but Phase Space does not, it goes to  <br>
infinity, and thus complexity can increase without limit in a closed universe  <br>
but not in an open one.  Of course, to have any confidence that all this  <br>
really does go to infinity and not just to a very large number we need to <br>
have a much better understanding of quantum gravity.<br>
