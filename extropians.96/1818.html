I'm not telling.  It's up to "Chris" to convince you, if it can, that it's<br>
not <br>
an AI program.<br>
<p>
But I will say this.  When I said the students used a "made-up" name,<br>
I misspoke myself.  I meant to say an *assumed* name,  i.e. they used<br>
the name of a real person who agreed to serve as front man (or woman)<br>
for the program.  In other words, just because you have met somebody<br>
at a party, it doesn't follow that he/she is the author of the posts<br>
attributed to him/her.<br>
