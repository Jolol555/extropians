Besides, as Thomas Sowell points out in _Race and Culture_ cultural values<br>
(from the family on out to "society") are a greater determinant than race<br>
of how smart and successful one becomes. Genetics are certainly a factor to<br>
some extent, but hardly as great as reading _The Bell Curve_ might lead one<br>
to believe.<br>

The word "gaijin" literally means "foreign person". Many Westerners like to
think that the Japanese use it in the same way as the Grand Dragon of the Ku
Klux Klan uses "nigger", but it ain't really true. They use it when they mean
"nigger", but they also sometimes use it to mean "honorable nigger".
