<p>
It seems to me that you're creating a duality where one really <br>
doesn't exist.  We are star children, we _are_ the universe - or at <br>
least a small part of it.  For the sake of this argument it might be <br>
useful however to define "the universe" as that which is outside of <br>
us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For us to 'rule' something, we have to have more power,</i><br>

<i>&gt; equal the universe (let alone rule it) for many, many millenia...if ever.</i><br>
<p>
As we grow we assimilate ( :-) ) more of the universe into ourselves <br>
and become more powerful, so to my mind it is quite likely and very <br>
desirable to have more power than the universe (universe = that which <br>
is not us).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is one large error on humanity's part that we think humans are</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything.  We are not everything.  There is so much out there that we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; not yet seen.  Often, our ignorance unknowingly blinds us to many</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities and probabilities.  Who can accurately say that "Survival can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the only ethic in this universe"?</i><br>
<p>
Ok, I got a little carried, I'd rather say that survival can be the <br>
only prime (or top meme) in this universe.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about exploration?  That is an </i><br>
<i>&gt; ethic that is within humanity; chances are, it is in many other</i><br>
<i>&gt; extra-terrestrial species as well.</i><br>
<p>
The only reason we explore is to survive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Survival is not an ethic, it is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; instinct.</i><br>
<p>
instinct = hardware ethic<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is an instinct that is embedded in our subconscious mind, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; when our mind consciously forfeits this instinct, we die.  Sure, we want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; survive in the universe, but don't we want to explore, see more, and be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of new knowledge as well?  I know I do.</i><br>
<p>
I do to.  But I see all these sub-goals I have are contributing to <br>
the biggie which is: survive or die.  We like seeking new anything <br>
because it was (and still is) a good survival trait to have.  ie. if <br>
our ancestors didn't have a want to explore and seek new knowledge we <br>
probably wouldn't be alive today.<br>
