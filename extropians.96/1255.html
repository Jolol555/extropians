<i>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, if I *imagine* a purple </i><br>
walrus, not a single photon is tracing a path from the sun to the walrus <br>
and into my eyes to be interpreted and registered in my brain.  Instead, <br>
I'm taking my memories of walruses and applying my memory of the color <br>
purple to it, to construct a hypothetical model.  I'm not 'seeing' a <br>
purple walrus in any sense that makes the purple walrus as much a 'fact' <br>
as things I perceive via the physical process of sight. <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
Anders:  or does anybody know<br>
When one imagines a visual stimuli, does it also register (measurably) as a<br>
change in the visual part of the brain? I know that they can measure light<br>
hitting the retina registering in the back of the brain.... Can one "see" the<br>
process of this kind of imaging ( as is "seeing" a purple walrus" ) in the<br>
brain _ or  trace it to retinal movement ( like in REM)  or, more importantly<br>
induce or improve the abilities to "see" in one's imagination?<br>
<p>
For example if one applies stimuli to the visual parts of the brain would it<br>
help someone "see" the purple walrus who had otherwise no ability to imaging<br>
visually?<br>
<p>
Have there been any studies about this "internal sight' that may be helpful<br>
to neural/retinal  VR?  I would think this virtual/ visual part of science -<br>
especially in the application of creating implants would be very important to<br>
someone who want s to be augmented.   Or even more to the "Uploaded"....<br>
