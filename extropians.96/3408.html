<i>&gt;From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I tend to live a proactive life under the guise of:</i><br>
<i>&gt;" "God" helps those who help themselves". I also, unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt;supertstitionists, have no idea of the location or nature of whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt;caused our universe to come into existence, so rather than atheist, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;tend to be agnostic. I have no convictions either way, and demand proof</i><br>
<i>&gt;of both sides, religious or atheist for their postion. My mother for</i><br>
<i>&gt;example considers herself a Catholic Agnostic, if you can believe it!</i><br>
<p>
I think most everyone is agnostic, even tho many won't admit it.  Most agree<br>
that they don't KNOW -- absolutely for sure -- that there is a god; they<br>
agree in the impossiblility of knowledge of the existance of god.  (However,<br>
a theist extropian might argue that some things that seem impossible now<br>
might be overcome and one day we transhumans might be able to prove or<br>
disprove the existance of god.)  But as George Smith argues (*Atheism: The<br>
Case Against God* and *Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies*) agnosticism<br>
is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned<br>
with a different aspect of religious belief.  Theism and atheism refer to<br>
the presence or absence of BELIEF in a god; agnosticism refers to the<br>
IMPOSSIBILITY OF KNOWLEDGE regarding a god or supernatural being.<br>
<p>
An agnostic, therefore, is one who maintains that there might be some<br>
supernatural being that is closed to human knowledge.  Religious "belief" is<br>
based on whatever it is you believe -- and usually "faith."  One can't say:<br>
well I WANT to believe, so I will.  Nor can one say: I don't WANT to<br>
believe, so I won't.  You either believe or you don't believe.  (Of course<br>
you can always change your mind.)  };-}<br>
<p>
According to Smith, theism and atheism exhaust all possible alternatives<br>
with regard to the belief in a god; one is either a theist or an atheist;<br>
there is no other choice.  (I guess he considers a deist a type of theist.)<br>
One either believes god exists or one does not.<br>
<p>
According to Smith, and I tend to agree, agnosticism is a legitimate<br>
philosophical position, but it is not a third alternative or halfway house<br>
between theism and atheism.  Instead, it is a variation of either theism or<br>
atheism.  The self-proclaimed agnostic must still designate whether he does<br>
or does not believe in a god -- and, in doing so, he commits himself to<br>
theism or he commits himself to atheism.  BUT HE DOES COMMIT HIMSELF.<br>
Agnosticism is not the escape clause that it is commonly thought to be.<br>
<p>
The issue of BELIEF still must be addressed regardless of one's agnosticism.<br>
I consider myself an agnostic, of course, regarding many things, but on the<br>
issue of god, I'm an atheist because I simply don't believe.<br>
<p>
Of course, then there's Omega . . .<br>
<p>
Anyone who is familiar with George Smith's writing might also be familiar<br>
with his response to Pascal's Wager: Smith's Wager.  I can't quite remember<br>
how it goes.  Anyone know?<br>
