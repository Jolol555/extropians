Now that the bashing has moved from Mike Lorrey, It's my turn. Go ahead.<br>
Pour it full on!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Um, HEY.... Chris shoudnt you see whethere a </i><br>
<i>&gt;"media attack" is what is really wanted? Do some </i><br>
<i>&gt;homework?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, in Cryonics, there is a danger of half</i><br>
<i>&gt;baked schemes and unthought out plans making everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;look bad, where suddenly the WHOLE movement is banned, and becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; scutinized in the wrong way under government and/or public attack, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt;could literally KILL us with your </i><br>
<i>&gt;"media attack".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Theses are delicate balances and things have repercussions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Chris, you are enthusiastic newbie, that is wonderful, I'm a newbie too,  but</i><br>
<i>&gt;please check in with people more knowledgeable than yourself before you take</i><br>
<i>&gt;any action "in our Extropian behalf".</i><br>
<i>&gt;I really mean this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ask Max, do some homework, read about the transhumanist movement. </i><br>
<i>&gt; You may find many people have a quite different take on this than YOU.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Please think things though before you jump.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I, FOR ONE, WOULD NOT WANT YOU TO SPEAK FOR ME!</i><br>
<i>&gt; (However well intentioned)</i><br>
<p>
I'm not trying to be a spokesperson, just trying to get some action out of<br>
you uhhh. people (pollitically correct). I want to create a list of all<br>
members and then release the list of members onto the mailinglist so people<br>
can know who is closest to them and if they wish to contact these people<br>
further, they can do it via private email. This way it would allow<br>
organization of many more local groups even if they are smaller. I'm not<br>
trying to be spokesperson or savior for the group, thats not my job. All I<br>
want is some action instead of us all sitting on our asses like some of us<br>
currently are!<br>
