Extropianism is certainly an interesting philosophy, and I sympathize<br>
strongly with most aspects of it -- this is why I subscribed to<br>
the mailing list.<br>
<p>
But I don't get the conceptual connection of Libertarianism with<br>
futuristic technology, complexity theory &amp; spontaneous organization.<br>
<p>
After all, is the State itself not a "spontaneous organization? --<br>
a self-organized structure.  The State was not exactly set in place<br>
from the outside, now was it -- it EMERGED, just like thought patterns<br>
in a neural network, just like hexagonal rolls in a Benard cell,<br>
etc. etc.<br>
<p>
My belief is that while current government structures are in many ways<br>
too restrictive, libertarianism would ALSO lead to an overly restrictive<br>
system.  Free markets don't seem to stay "free" -- they seem to drift<br>
into attractors consisting of MONOPOLIES or OLIGOPOLIES.  Look at the<br>
software market, which is a free market, but is dominated by MicroSoft<br>
to everyone's detriment.  What is needed is some kind of "institutionalization<br>
of experimentation" -- some kind of overall structure to prevent the<br>
spontaneous emergence of repressive governmental and corporate structures.<br>
IN my opinion.  But this is a personal opinion which I do not claim to<br>
have derived from scientific principles, mind you...<br>
<p>
I think the question of the optimal social structure is an interesting<br>
one, which is probably explorable by computer simulations along the <br>
lines of the commercial SimCity program.  I don't think that it is wise<br>
to link one political persuasion (libertarianism) with hi technology<br>
and freedom, to the exclusion of others.  Hasn't complexity science<br>
taught us that things are not this simple??<br>
