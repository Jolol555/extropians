Unfortunately, the words "agnostic" and "atheist" are not very <br>
precise and have a great deal of overlap, and yet are not synonyms.  <br>
<p>
One of the most lucid discussions of the various kinds of atheism and <br>
the meaning of the word itself is the introduction to atheism faq for <br>
the ald.atheism newsgroup.  It clears up much of the fog surrounding <br>
the words "atheist" and "agnostic".  It can be found at:<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; The self-proclaimed agnostic must still designate whether he does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or does not believe in a god -- and, in doing so, he commits himself to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; theism or he commits himself to atheism.  BUT HE DOES COMMIT HIMSELF.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Agnosticism is not the escape clause that it is commonly thought to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Disagree.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't maintain that there is or is not a god. I don't definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in god. I don't definitely disbelieve in god. Neither do I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that it is unknowable whether there is a god or not. Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I don't know, or know how to know. I could invoke Kosko and say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I both believe and disbelieve. I *definitely* don't believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; forcing black/white divisions on something that is as fuzzy as human</i><br>
<i>&gt; belief. :-)</i><br>
