<i>&gt; For the benefit of people outside the United States, for whom these </i><br>

<p>
Your guess is correct, SAT stands for Scholastic Aptitude Test.  The <br>
test is given in two parts, verbal and mathematical, and the scores on <br>
each part range from 200 to 800, so the highest possible score is 1600.  <br>
The original idea was that the average score would be 1000, like an IQ <br>
of 100.  But the scores have been falling for decades.  Most students -- <br>
even those who are in fact admitted to universities -- score less than <br>
1000.  The decline has occurred at all levels.  Thirty years ago, at <br>
elite schools (Harvard, MIT, Caltech), the median score for incoming <br>
freshmen was about 1500.  By 1990 it had fallen to about 1400.  As a <br>
result of this persistent decline, the scores were recalibrated a couple of <br>
years ago.  <br>
<p>
The SAT is concerned with general knowledge of high school math and <br>
English;  geometry, algebra, trigonometry, a little calculus;  vocabulary, <br>
synonym recognition, and basic reasoning ability.  For example, the <br>
student reads a paragraph, and is asked what it is about;  there are four <br>
choices, three of which are absurd; but most people who take the test <br>
miss these questions.  Most people who take the test miss *most* of the <br>
questions.  A mystery.  <br>
<p>
The SAT is given in the morning.  In the afternoon, the students take <br>
three tests in specific subjects (such as chemistry, history, etc).  The <br>
whole battery of tests is known as the "college boards."  The afternoon <br>
tests are also scored on a range from 200 to 800.  Even thirty years ago, <br>
it was extremely rare for anyone to have an average score of 750 or <br>
better for all five tests.  But some did.  <br>
