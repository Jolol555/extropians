What happened in the second world war was terrible, but i've always felt<br>
annoyed by people who display todays ethics on the past. Ethical beliefs<br>
work in ways very similar to that of prejudice, setting them aside sometimes<br>
leads to understanding.<br>
<p>
If there had been no gas chambers, that would imply that the nazis had<br>
marched or worked the jewish population to death. Much like the americans of<br>
european origin did with the native americans (maybe more than 6 million ?).<br>
Also the US govt did practically the same with the americans of japanese<br>
origin, and i wonder how many communists were victimized during the red<br>
scare. Times were different and so were ethics... <br>
<p>
The nuremberg laws of 1935, deprived all jews of citizenship, and forbade<br>
intermarriage between jews and non jews. Jews were beaten up, driven from<br>
public offices, ruined in private business, and in some cases put to death.<br>
Much like how the USA dealt with its african american population in the<br>
past. (not that much earlier...)<br>
<p>
I'm almost sure there were gas chambers, as i believe the human capability<br>
for cruelty in this war, is also proven by the use of nuclear weapons by the<br>
allieds, the unnessecary bombing of german and japanese cities (targeting<br>
the population), at a moment when the war was practically won already, and<br>
by starving the german population (as well as that of countries still<br>
occupied by the nazis) to death in the winter of 1945, by enforcing a<br>
boycot. As well as forcing german people from their home and land in eastern<br>
germany after the war. The german people payed for their mistakes, why<br>
continue to rub their nose in it ? <br>
<p>
In my opinion a sceptical and rational analasis of this period, does not<br>
involve choosing sides. In a war the scope of this one, acts of cruelty come<br>
from both sides. Do you think it mattered to the women who lived in the<br>
neutral countries if they were raped by german or allied soldiers ? Are the<br>
allied countries excused for their acts in the past by proving the nazis<br>
commited more horrible crimes against humanity ?<br>
<p>
Another point is that if the Nazis hadn't started a war, they would probably<br>
also have gotten away with killing the german jews, without allied<br>
interference, and judgement the scope of which we witnessed after the war. <br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;From here on i will use the word germans instead of nazis, as they got into</i><br>
power by popular democratic support, and in many cases represented the will<br>
of the german people. Yes, shocking as it may seem today, many people in<br>
europe were anti-semites back then, (just like many people in the USA were<br>
racists once) not just in germany, and many probably still would be, if it<br>
wasn't for the allieds need for popular justification of their war effort.<br>
(this maybe the only positive thing about the war)  <br>
<p>
<p>
The 'but the germans started the war' argument.<br>
<p>
In the eyes of the Germans (and some allied countries), the first world war<br>
had never ended, the French had already occupied german territory once since<br>
the peace. A war or at least a conflict between the former allieds and<br>
germany was inevitable under the conditions imposed by the treaty of<br>
versailles. <br>
<p>
<p>
The 'but the germans invaded neutral countries' argument. <br>
<p>
The allied powers had made it clear to some initially neutral countries that<br>
if they were to stay neutral, they would be invaded by allied forces. The<br>
French had planned to invade the Netherlands if it was to stay neutral,<br>
luckily we didn't so our french allies just initiated the scorched earth<br>
tactic while on the run from the germans. There were to be no more neutral<br>
countries of strategic importance, the allieds didn't want a repetition of<br>
the first war. <br>
<p>
<p>
In my opinion Adolf Hitler was the worst criminal humanity has known, but he<br>
is followed directly by the leaders of the allied powers of that period. But<br>
i try not to make my ethical judgements interfere with my capabilities to<br>
understand history or humanity.<br>
<p>
My own country, the Netherlands has a history of crimes which ranks right up<br>
there with most western powers. The repression in indonesia, the slave trade<br>
form africa to the americas, the repression of catholics, collaboration with<br>
the nazis etc... <br>
<p>
The Jewish people in Israel have started to feel the burden of being in the<br>
shoes of the repressor with the intifadah, having to shoot at palestinian<br>
kids throwing rocks and molotov coctails. But long before that they were<br>
citizens of the western states, sharing some of responsability for the<br>
crimes that these states comitted in our eyes today.<br>
<p>
<p>
Whether the gas chambers existed or not, is a fact which is irellevant, when<br>
one looks at the total sum of monstrocities committed in this war. The<br>
western powers chose to eliminate just anti-semitism and totalitariansim,<br>
but leave militarism and nationalism intact. The gas chambers probably did<br>
exist, and all the horrors probably are true, but is leaving out other major<br>
details not the same as lying ? They are words in a history book, written<br>
next to many other words which could also be viewed as controversial.<br>
Compare any two current history books of two different countries about a<br>
period when they were at war, say 100 years before they were allies or<br>
friends, and note the indescrepancies. <br>
Be thankful that you live in a county where it is allowed to question<br>
history. (in most european countries this specific item is not open for<br>
discussion, and anyone denying the holocaust risks being fined or imprisoned)<br>
<p>
Anyone sceptically questioning history in a rational way, should be allowed<br>
to do so, without having to take ethical views of groups or individuals into<br>
account. The choice of this particular piece of histroy, suggests however<br>
that the sceptical questioning of history of the writer, is subject to his<br>
own political goals. Such a shame, if there's one branch of 'science' which<br>
could really use some truly rational thinking, it's history. <br>
<p>
 <br>
To any racists or anti-semites who read this, i know a place for you,<br>
somewhere on one of earths future colonies in space, it's a space of about<br>
50 square km and your neigbours will be such fine people as religious<br>
fundamentalists from various religions, racists of other races, and various<br>
groups of intollerant people in general. You will live there in total<br>
isolation from the rest of humanity and your children and those who have<br>
abandoned their intollerance are free to come back any time. <br>
<p>
I know this is not a realistic solution, but i can dream can't i ? ;-)<br>
