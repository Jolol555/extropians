Chris Hind said, "I don't remember who it was on this list who said they were <br>
able to naturally exhibit the traits typical of hallucinagenics through <br>
training and concentration bringing on 'mystic' experiences. Unless they just <br>
had<br>
high doses of LSD stored in their fat cells and went jogging. :)"<br>
<p>
I'm the one who said I have developed a fairly psychedelic state of mind as my <br>
normal state of consciousness, because of the training I've put myself <br>
through.  Actually, I haven't used much LSD (less than ten times, normal doses <br>
each time), so it has nothing to do with storing it in my fat cells and <br>
releasing it later.  It's all from my training.<br>
<p>
The central core of my training is learning to pay deep attention to <br>
everything I can.  I keep my focus on my present moment of experience, on my <br>
current sensations and my thoughts, my emotions, everything I can.  It's <br>
amazing how different things begin looking when I pay more attention to them.  <br>
My old ways of seeing things and understanding things are so obselete compared <br>
to how I see things now.  I see at a glance now what used to take me several <br>
seconds or minutes of staring.  I see my thoughts so clearly and am able to <br>
follow them so easily and understand types of things almost instantly which <br>
used to take me days or weeks to allow to sink in and fully realize.<br>
<p>
There are some "drawbacks" from this discipline, though.  Remember when you <br>
became an atheist?  It was probably pretty traumatic for you, dropping a <br>
belief system like that (I know it was for me, anyway).  Imagine going through <br>
something as shattering as that on a monthly or weekly basis...  That's the <br>
kind of shit that happens all the time now that I've trained myself to pay <br>
such deep attention to things.  I see through my current layers of belief <br>
systems so quickly that I'm almost perpetually in a state of extreme upset.  <br>
Although, I have learned to maintain a semblence of sanity around other <br>
people, and I actually do my work better than ever.  When I first started <br>
going through these profound belief system revisions, I felt like I had to <br>
change my exterior life dramatically, but now that it happens so often, it's <br>
much easier (especially on other people) to just go along with everything and <br>
not disrupt everything too much, at least on the outside.<br>
<p>
Imagine going for a walk and seeing everything so clearly and being fascinated <br>
by every little detail.  Imagine looking down at the dried leaves scattered on <br>
the sidewalk and seeing all the vein patterns in each one of them and feeling <br>
like you've been staring at them forever and then looking up at the trunk of <br>
the tree you're passing and seeing all the intricate details of the bark and <br>
wanting that moment to last forever but still feeling intensely hungry to see <br>
more, so you look up at the naked branches above you and see every last twig <br>
with the sky behind it and the wispy clouds moving.  Then you look ahead and <br>
see the sidewalk and all the houses in intricate detail and all the dirt on <br>
them and all the paint chips and *everything*.  You hear the leaves crunch <br>
such an overwhelmingly exquisite crunch that seems to go on endlessly, and <br>
then you realize that you've only taken two steps in a brisk walk during all <br>
that time of exquisitely fascinating detail.  You walk on, and every step is <br>
that intense...<br>
<p>
This is the kind of stuff that I've been working on developing in my mind, and <br>
now it happens on an increasingly regular basis.  This stuff is very <br>
beautiful, but it's also very upsetting.  When one is immersed in the world of <br>
experience and watching all of one's fleeting thoughts, rising and falling, <br>
seemingly endlessly, everything one is used to holding on to just falls away <br>
and there's nothing but this moment.  It can be quite terrifying at times, but <br>
it is generally very exhilarating to see everything so clearly and to <br>
understand things that were hard for me to see before.<br>
<p>
I just thought I'd warn you, in case you were thinking of doing such things <br>
yourself.  It's a difficult but exquisite path to follow.  The key to <br>
developing these psychedelic states is to learn to pay close attention to <br>
everything, to develop a very watchful mind, to keep bringing one's attention <br>
to the present moment.  The benefits are greatly increased intelligence and <br>
learning speed as well as much more detailed and exquisite reality.  The <br>
"drawbacks" are the feelings of having the ground perpetually being yanked out <br>
from under oneself and having to do "sanity checks" fairly often (just to make <br>
sure).  I also have a difficult time sleeping regular hours and am often up <br>
all night, but that may just be me.  And (I'm not sure if you would consider <br>
this a benefit or a drawback), time seems to go very, very slowly -- a day can <br>
sometimes seem like weeks or months, so one has to learn to be fascinated by <br>
everything or be horribly bored (stopping at a traffic light can seem like a <br>
LONG time).  Also, one has to learn to keep track of slower activities, such <br>
as crossing the room to get something and not get too distracted along the way <br>
by all of the thousands of thoughts and fascinating details one is <br>
experiencing (at first, you may keep asking yourself, "Now, what was I <br>
doing?").<br>
<p>
Good luck, if you decide to pursue creating these states of mind within <br>
yourself.  And don't forget to laugh long and hard fairly often...<br>
