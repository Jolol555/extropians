<p>
The Prometheus Project<br>
<p>
     Convincingly demonstrated, scientifically proven and published,<br>
     fully reversible long-term brain cryopreservation within 10 years<br>
<p>
     As of July 31, 1996, after about six weeks of promotion, first in<br>
CryoCare Forum, and then on the Internet through the CryoNet list and the<br>
sci.cryonics news-group, pledges of $212,200.00 per year, or a total of<br>
$2,122,000.00 payable over a 10 year period have been solicited for the<br>
Prometheus Project. These pledges, ranging in yearly value from $1,000 to<br>
$25,000, have been made by 38 individuals and 2 organizations.<br>
<p>
     The research project which has been greeted so enthusiastically and<br>
supported so strongly is one which several of us have been talking about for<br>
many months now since we realized that two of the most critical factors which<br>
have kept cryonics small, insecure and unscientific, have become<br>
substantially improved. Those two factors are:<br>
<p>
1)   that current cryobiological methods to reversibly preserve large organs<br>
     which are now nearing perfection should be applicable to the human brain<br>
     after suitable modifications, and<br>
<p>
2)   that the population and the wealth of the cryonics community has reached<br>
     a size which should enable it to support mainstream cryobiological<br>
     research to perfect and convincingly demonstrate fully reversible<br>
     mammalian brain cryopreservation, if cryonicists could only be convinced<br>
     to do so.<br>
     <br>
     Because of its audacity and life-providing purpose we have named this<br>
project: The Prometheus Project. If our pledge campaign is successful the<br>
project research will be conducted by a for-profit corporation to be formed<br>
for this immediate purpose and for the longer-range purpose of producing<br>
fully reversible whole-body suspended animation. At this time only solid<br>
pledges of $1,000 or more per year for 10 years beginning in 1998 are being<br>
requested. When a total of over $1,000,000 per year has been pledged, a<br>
company will be formed, an investment prospectus will be issued, share<br>
purchase contracts will be signed by all consenting pledgers, the first<br>
year's payments will be collected, shares will be issued, and the project<br>
will begin. In accordance with SEC regulations, I must state that this<br>
writing is not a solicitation for the purpose of purchasing shares in any<br>
existing corporation.<br>
<p>
     Needless to say, it is my strong belief, and one I sincerely hope that<br>
you will share with me after due consideration of this Project, that the most<br>
rewarding aspect of the successful completion of the Prometheus Project will<br>
be the almost certain opportunity for each of us to live vastly extended,<br>
healthy lives.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Purpose of The Prometheus Project<br>
<p>
     The purpose of the Prometheus Project is to demonstrate by methods which<br>
will be convincing to the public and will be published in a peer reviewed<br>
scientific journal, the restoration to normal physiological and mental<br>
functioning of a mammalian brain which has been preserved and stored at a<br>
temperature below -140xC for at least 6 months or which could be so stored<br>
for hundreds of years if necessary without additional damage.<br>
<p>
<p>
Logical Necessity of The Prometheus Project for Those Who Wish to Stay Alive<br>
<p>
The Problem:<br>
<p>
1.   Unless major scientific anti-aging advances are made, every one of us<br>
     faces the virtually certain inability of our body to sustain its life<br>
     within a period of 125 years minus our present age. If you are over 75<br>
     years old, the chance of major anti-aging and rejuvenating scientific<br>
     advances being made soon enough to allow you to live a vastly extended<br>
     healthy lifetime is virtually zero. If you are over 50 years old, the<br>
     chance of this is still extremely small. Even if you are only 25 years<br>
     old, the chance is marginal at best.<br>
2.   In order to continue to live, each of us needs a "time machine" to<br>
     transport him or her, at least mentally intact, into the future. At<br>
     present there is no method with the proven ability to do this. Even the<br>
     best current methods of chemical or cryogenic preservation result in<br>
     massive damage to the body and brain from which any future recovery is<br>
     at best very uncertain.<br>
3.   Furthermore, it has not been proven, and may not even be true that the<br>
     brain structures which determine our memories, our personality and all<br>
     of our other precious individual mental attributes are being well<br>
     preserved through current agonal and cryopreservation processes.<br>
4.   The idea of cryonics has been around for 30 years now and the number of<br>
     people actually signed up has only grown to between 600 and 700.<br>
5.   Because of the length of time that it has been around, the publicity<br>
     which such a radical idea has received, and the plot/entertainment value<br>
     of such a sensational theme, the cryonics idea is now very widely known.<br>
6.   Yet cryonics as currently practiced, remains small and possibly unstable<br>
     over the long term. Therefore, even if our mental attributes are being<br>
     preserved through the current agonal and cryopreservation processes, and<br>
     *can* be fully restored, most people have little confidence that anyone<br>
     cryopreserved today will reach, still preserved, that possibly far<br>
     future time when advanced technology *will* be able to effect the<br>
     necessary restoration.<br>
7.   In spite of the multitude of traditional beliefs about death in our<br>
     society (I'll have had enough; over-crowding of the planet; make a place<br>
     for the young ones; I'll live on in my children; necessary to insure<br>
     creativity; it's natural; want to be reincarnated; want to go to heaven;<br>
     etc. etc. etc.), there are still 100's of thousands if not 10's of<br>
     millions of people in North America who truly love life and would very<br>
     much like to have a lot more of it, so long as they could remain<br>
     mentally and physically healthy.<br>
8.   The vast majority of even those who do not accept any of these beliefs<br>
     about death will never sign-up for, nor support cryonics while they<br>
     remain relatively healthy, because, being small and unproven it has so<br>
     little chance of saving them. Instead, they prefer to put any "extra"<br>
     money into anti-aging methods and research aimed at extending their<br>
     first "life cycle", giving little thought to the possibility of a<br>
     *second* "life cycle".<br>
<p>
The Solution:<br>
<p>
1.   There does exist a method which has been shown to allow the preservation<br>
     of a complex organ with no freezing injury at all. With this method<br>
     viable rabbit kidneys have been recovered from temperatures as low as<br>
     -40xC, with recovery from much colder temperatures expected soon. This<br>
     method is called vitrification. It involves turning the organ to be<br>
     preserved into a glassy substance, cooling it to cryogenic temperatures,<br>
     and keeping it stored at those temperatures until such time as we wish<br>
     to recover it for use. Just as glass is fluid at high temperatures and<br>
     becomes solid as it is cooled to lower temperatures without any<br>
     crystallization occurring, so too biological tissue, by having its<br>
     internal water largely replaced with a special solution, can be made to<br>
     behave like glass and incur no disruptive crystalline formation when it<br>
     is cooled, even to the temperature of -140xC. (This temperature will be<br>
     used because it is almost universally agreed by the cryobiological<br>
     science community that it is sufficiently low to allow storage for<br>
     several hundred years if necessary with negligible deterioration.) The<br>
     trick is, however, to use a solution and a method of water removal which<br>
     does not in itself irreversibly damage the biological tissue.<br>
<p>
2.   Because this vitrification protocol is organ specific, the exact<br>
     protocol for kidneys will not work for many other organs. Therefore, if<br>
     we are ever to achieve suspended animation of the whole human body, we<br>
     must proceed to make it work for other organs. The most important human<br>
     organ, and the logical starting point for this purpose is the brain.<br>
<p>
3.   The scientist who has developed this method of preservation for rabbit<br>
     kidneys has stated that he does not see any technical reason why this<br>
     method, with suitable modifications should not be applicable to any<br>
     mammalian organ including the brain. Furthermore, he has estimated that<br>
     for any particular organ, the necessary modifications should be able to<br>
     be discovered and perfected within a time-span of under 10 years and<br>
     with a project budget of under a million dollars per year.<br>
<p>
4.   Neuroscience developments and techniques for assessing brain function<br>
     directly should allow us to convincingly demonstrate the mental<br>
     attributes of an isolated mammalian brain. It is also believed that it<br>
     should be possible to do in-situ cryopreservation of a mammalian brain<br>
     and cooling, perhaps to -70xC, with full recovery of the intact animal.<br>
<p>
5.   If we can produce a method by which first a mammalian, next a primate,<br>
     and finally a human brain can be placed in long-term biological stasis<br>
     and recovered with its functionality including all mental attributes<br>
     unquestionably alive and complete, we will have the proof that death can<br>
     be defeated - that in principal, a life can be extended indefinitely.<br>
     Once convincingly demonstrable, fully reversible, long-term preservation<br>
     of the brain has been achieved, the mainstream medical and scientific<br>
     community will accept the scientific validity of the cryonics idea.<br>
     Major public and private money will be spent to develop methods of<br>
     providing a body for a restored brain, and to perfect whole-body long-<br>
     term suspended animation, if possible. The practice of preserving the<br>
     brain, and later the whole-body, if possible, will become an optional<br>
     standard medical procedure for the terminally ill and the laws will be<br>
     changed to accommodate this new paradigm.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Logic of The Prometheus Project Funding Method<br>
<p>
1.   Those persons who have a great desire for vastly extended life *will*<br>
     sincerely pledge major amounts of money to a convincingly demonstrable<br>
     fully reversible brain cryopreservation project if they are convinced<br>
     that it is necessary in order to achieve such extended life, that it has<br>
     sound planning which will enable it to succeed if it is funded, and if<br>
     their pledges are not due until it *does* have sound planning and *is*<br>
     fully funded.<br>
<p>
2.   Most of those with incomes over $50K per year (and certainly all of<br>
     those with incomes over $100K per year) should be able to afford to<br>
     forgo the present spending of $5-10K per year (at least if tax<br>
     deductible) without degrading their life-style in any way detrimental to<br>
     their health and longevity.<br>
<p>
3.   Within the cryonics and life-extension community, there are well over<br>
     200 people who fit this category. Hence, there are a more than<br>
     sufficient number of people to fund a project which will scientifically<br>
     demonstrate that long-term reversible brain preservation will work, and<br>
     therefore, that will be virtually certain to enormously increase the<br>
     chance of their lives having the potential of immortality.<br>
<p>
4.   The Prometheus Project defined here is an attainable and fundable goal.<br>
     The results obtained from the 22 cryonicists on CryoCare Forum (over<br>
     $100K per year was pledged) strongly suggest that it is realistic to<br>
     expect to obtain between 100 and 200 pledges of amounts between $5,000<br>
     per year and $10,000 per year each for 10 years.<br>
<p>
<p>
Organization of the Collection of the Pledges<br>
<p>
     As founder of the Prometheus Project, Paul Wakfer, one of the $10,000<br>
per year pledgers, will be the person who accepts the pledges and will be the<br>
founder and the interim president of the corporation which is formed once the<br>
necessary total of $1M per year for 10 years is reached until the Prometheus<br>
Project officially begins.<br>
<p>
     If the Prometheus Project pledge campaign succeeds in reaching its<br>
target of over $1M per year pledged for 10 years, the pledgers will be able<br>
to purchase shares in a for-profit corporation which will be formed to<br>
conduct the scientific research of the project. These shares will be<br>
purchased over a 10 year period at a fixed price of $100.00 per share with<br>
the requirement that an equal amount must be purchased for each of the 10<br>
years. Pledges will not be due and no money will be collected until pledgers<br>
who approve the scientific and business plans have signed legally binding<br>
share purchase agreements totaling over $1M per year. Any pledger who does<br>
not approve of these plans may withdraw his pledge before the Prometheus<br>
Project begins. The signing of legally binding share purchase agreements is<br>
necessary to insure that the required funding will be forthcoming each year<br>
after the project begins.<br>
<p>
     Pledgers who wish to have a tax deduction for the amount of their<br>
contribution are encouraged to make arrangements with one of the cryonics<br>
organizations or life extension societies which have the ability to issue tax<br>
deductible receipts for charitable donations. After the Prometheus Project<br>
has begun, those organizations will then use the donated moneys to purchase<br>
shares under the same terms as other individual or corporate purchasers.<br>
Cryonics organizations which have this capability (or will soon) are:<br>
<p>
                    Alcor Life Extension Foundation<br>
                    American Cryonics Society<br>
                    CryoCare Foundation<br>
                    The Immortalist Society<br>
<p>
All cryonics organizations have been contacted and have been asked for their<br>
help in promoting the Prometheus Project through mailings to their membership<br>
and advertisements in their periodicals. They have also been asked to accept<br>
donation pledges, to turn these into share purchases if the pledge campaign<br>
is successful, and, furthermore, to proxy the shareholder voting power of the<br>
shares which a donor's money has purchased to that same donor. By this<br>
method, individual contributing cryonicists and life extensionists will<br>
control the Project instead of the competitive and sometimes antagonistic<br>
cryonics organizations. It should be very clear that the success of the<br>
Prometheus Project will be extremely beneficial for the cryonics<br>
organizations, their members and their patients. In addition, the Life<br>
Extension Foundation has agreed to accept donation pledges, and later to<br>
accept donations, to issue tax deductible receipts, and to make share<br>
purchases under the contractual terms necessary for funding the Prometheus<br>
Project.<br>
<p>
     The Prometheus Project will be delighted to accept any pledge of $1000<br>
or more per year, but for administrative and share purchase purposes requires<br>
that all pledges be made in units of $100 per year. Again it should be noted<br>
that all pledges must be for the same amount per year for all 10 years,<br>
although up-front, lump-sum pledges with delivery of shares yearly are also<br>
acceptable. A pledge for $8,000 as a lump-sum up-front payment is being<br>
accepted as equivalent to a pledge of $1,000 per year for 10 years.<br>
<p>
     Any individual or organization who pledges, and later purchases shares<br>
will receive "technology credits" of a dollar value equal to twice that paid<br>
for their shares. If the corporation should develop technology which it then<br>
sells for the purpose of human cryopreservation, by returning shares to the<br>
corporation, these technology credits may be used for purchasing this<br>
technology. In this way, if the corporation should develop technology which<br>
allows less damaging human cryopreservation, every purchaser of shares who is<br>
also a cryonicist or cryonics organization is guaranteed to obtain a return<br>
of at least double their investment. If the corporation succeeds in patenting<br>
highly marketable discoveries, inventions and procedures, of course, the<br>
return from the rise in share price may be far greater.<br>
<p>
     While pledges are being received and are building to the total of $1M<br>
per year required, the scientific plan of The Prometheus Project and the<br>
business plan of the corporation which will conduct it, will be developed and<br>
prepared. Any help that can be contributed to this part of the project (or<br>
any other part) is very much welcomed. These plans will be published even in<br>
unfinished form as they are developed and prepared. This project is very much<br>
a "boot-strap" process. For many reasons, I believe that is the *best* way to<br>
accomplish it. I look forward to your questions and suggestions and you can<br>
be sure that if the ideas are worthy, they *will* be incorporated into the<br>
developing project plans.<br>
<p>
     At this time, the Prometheus Project is essentially a pledge campaign<br>
asking a strictly hypothetical question:<br>
<p>
1) *If* $1M/yr in pledges for 10 years is collected, and<br>
2) *if* satisfactory scientific and business plans are developed, and<br>
3) *if* the researchers and their projects are satisfactory to you, and<br>
4) *if* a corporation is formed to employ these scientists to execute these<br>
    projects which issues a prospectus and share offering for that purpose,<br>
4) *then* how much would you be willing to contribute, beginning in 1998, to<br>
    share purchases of equal amounts for up to 10 years, in that corporation.<br>
<p>
No money is being requested and no investments are being solicited. If this<br>
campaign is not successful no corporation to execute the project will ever be<br>
formed.<br>
<p>
     The reason why I believe that the Prometheus Project pledge campaign<br>
will be successful is that you are *not* being asked, "how much are you<br>
willing to invest in a high-risk, bio-tech R&amp;D startup", even though any<br>
corporation which executes the Prometheus Project plan will be all of that.<br>
No, you are being asked, "how much of your present life are you willing to<br>
commit towards a very good chance at an enormously lengthened future life",<br>
and *that* is a significantly different question.<br>
<p>
      Before ending, I wish to leave you with some thoughts.<br>
<p>
     For several weeks now, I have been putting a lot of thought toward what<br>
I am now calling the "Prometheus Project" and I very strongly believe that<br>
each of us who really wants to live should begin pushing this project<br>
constantly and continuously with all the time, money and life-force which he<br>
or she can afford without degrading his or her current life below a certain<br>
minimum acceptable quality. I have become convinced that if any of us are to<br>
survive long-term, one way or the other, this project *must* be accomplished.<br>
I believe that the Prometheus Project should be nonpartisan and strongly<br>
supported by all organizations because it is much too big for any one<br>
cryonics organization. We need all the ideas and help we can get from any<br>
source whatever and *I* pledge to promote it and discuss it with absolutely<br>
no negativity, innuendo or bias with regard to any particular organization or<br>
individual. I expect each organization and each cryonicist to understand why<br>
it will be beneficial for them to strongly support the project. We must speak<br>
about this project in all our communications and continue to speak of it non-<br>
stop, and relentlessly until we have achieved the funding goal. I ask every<br>
one of you to include it with every thing you write, hammering away at the<br>
idea incessantly, never letting up for a moment until we have done it.<br>
<p>
     The Prometheus Project is not a *charity* for which I am begging you to<br>
give up part of your life for some purpose exterior to you which *I* happen<br>
to think is important. No! What I am asking is that you honor *yourself*,<br>
that exquisite individual consciousness which is yours alone.<br>
