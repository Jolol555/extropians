<i>&gt; &gt; Your argument is intended to cover both goods and information,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; With respect to goods, your argument make the assumption that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the cost of transportation is negligable, or at least that the cost is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; less than the difference in cost between the buyer's manufacturing cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and the seller's manufacturing cost of the good the seller is attempting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to sell.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Genie machines have, along with their many other nifty features,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability to move things -- or to make trucks (or other devices) with</i><br>
<i>&gt; which to move things.  Some people will find that they are better suited</i><br>
<i>&gt; to this task than to anything else, and they will specialize in it.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; will use their genie machines to move things... in more mundane</i><br>
<i>&gt; language, they will work for UPS.  The cost of transportation will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparable to the cost of everything else in genie-land.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The cost of making somthing in a large-scale genie machine (a factory),</i><br>
<i>&gt; putting it on a truck or train, and shipping it somewhere, will be less,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in many cases, than the cost of reprogramming a genie machine to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; the item at home.  Just like now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I don't understand this assertion. There are irreducable costs in matter<br>
and energy associated with the production of an item, based on the laws<br>
of physics. There are additional costs in energy associated with<br>
transportation. There are also capital costs associated with a<br>
specialized<br>
factory, and probably large capital costs (in real estate) associated<br>
with transportation. These costs give my poor little home-brew MNT<br>
thingee a large initial advantage that your economy must overcome.<br>
Since neither of us really knows the actual efficiencies versus the<br>
actual<br>
costs, we are just stating opinions. But that's OK as long as we're<br>
having fun.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The basic argument here is that you are trying to escape from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic system, and I'm saying you can't.  You can make any</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumption you want, consistent with physical reality, and I can show</i><br>
<i>&gt; that even with that assumption, you will still be in an economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I will give you SI, I will give you software that replicates itself,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I will give you diamondoid materials:  and given all that, you will</i><br>
<i>&gt; still be in an economy.  There is no escape!   &lt;evil g&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Robin keeps saying that I can already drop out and become a mountain<br>
man.<br>
(In my day, we more frequently dropped out and became hippies in the<br>
desert,<br>
but you get the idea.) I only have to participate in the economy if<br>
I want to. My decision to participate depends on whether or not the<br>
economy<br>
has something I want badly enough that I will participate rather than<br>
making it myself. Currently, there are a lot of things in this category.<br>
It's not clear that this will continue to be the case with MNT. The<br>
decision<br>
to drop out is not "econimically ratinal." Rather, it depends on my<br>
personal decisions about how I wish to spend my time.<br>
<p>
Note: a desision to drop out of the economy is not a decision to drop<br>
out<br>
of society. I can still contribute to the general discourse, or just<br>
have fun<br>
interacting with others. <br>
<p>
I actually believe that an MNT-based economy will arise, If there is<br>
more<br>
than one intelligent entity left after the singularity. However, I do<br>
not<br>
believe that the existing economy will evolve into the MNT economy. I<br>
believe that the existing economy will undergo a meltdown.<br>
