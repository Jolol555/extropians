After 18 months on this list I have to agree with you that there is too<br>
much volume on the list (my patience ends at about 30 messages per day)<br>
and that many topics repeat due to the newbies. (myself included). I am<br>
beginning to think in terms of a moderated list. Perhaps this could be a<br>
group effort. Here's one idea:<br>
<p>
All postings come in to the main moderator. This person forwards<br>
messages per their subject to moderators interested in various topics.<br>
One place to start is to have a moderator for each of the Extropian<br>
Principles. Another would to be request volunteers for each thread as<br>
threads arise. The topical moderators then place the useful postings<br>
into the list.<br>
<p>
If Majordomo can't handle this, perhaps there should be 5 or 6 Exi<br>
Lists, one for each major category of thread. I would appreciate this<br>
for I have little interest in some topics, such as econonomics. To get<br>
the ball rolling, here is a suggested topics breakdown:<br>
<p>
	Principles - Max should do this one<br>
	Economics<br>
	Libertarianism<br>
	Technology<br>
	Transhumanism<br>
	Philosophy<br>
	Of General Interest<br>
<p>
To compliment this, there needs to be an Archives also sorted by these<br>
categories so newbies can be directed to same for reference. Said<br>
Archives should also be only the best stuff. A bane of most archives is<br>
their tendency to collect everything...<br>
