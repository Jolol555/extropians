As Anders said, even VR navel-gazers will want more and more hardware<br>
to run on.  I don't see why *every* member of every "transcendent"<br>
society should be uninterested in gaining control of more and more<br>
stuff and energy to transform it.  And it probably only takes<br>
one transcendant person to explode.<br>

Yes. I thought of this point this weekend, and just revised the paper <br>
to reflect it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  3. Higher life forms do explode into cosmos, but in ways </i><br>
<i>&gt;     that are invisible to us. This would presumably mean that </i><br>
<i>&gt;     they do not engage in galactic scale constructions, and that </i><br>
<i>&gt;     they are not interested in contacting human level life. ...     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Humanoid civilisations might not be at all interesting to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     posthumans. </i><br>
<p>
But some of them should be interested in our raw mass and the sun's energy.<br>
Unless it is always cheaper to get more mass/energy by creating a<br>
"baby universe" or some such.<br>
          <br>
<i>&gt;          there would still be a chance that the civilisations on two </i><br>
<i>&gt;          planets could overlap so that one would find out about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;          other.  ... [so SETI data gives] an estimate of the a </i><br>
<i>&gt;          priori probability that we should have discovered </i><br>
<i>&gt;          extraterrestrial life</i><br>
   <br>
This is a good point, which I have added, citing you.<br>
