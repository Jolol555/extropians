<i>&gt;&gt; Rule the universe to what end?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To survive.  And survival is an end in itself.  Survival can be the </i><br>
<i>&gt;only ethic in this universe.</i><br>
<p>
        I have to disagree.  I don't like the term 'ruling', especially when<br>
it is placed in the context of the universe: a vast --and possibly<br>
infinite-- part of space.  I'm pretty sure that Reilly agrees that the<br>
universe does not have to be ruled...especially not to the end of survival.<br>
The universe *is*.  Humans *are*.  What we decide to do within the universe<br>
is totally up to us, however, the universe holds astronomically &lt;g&gt; higher<br>
amounts of energy than we do.  That fact cannot be ignored.  We should try<br>
to coexist instead.  For us to 'rule' something, we have to have more power,<br>
either mentally or physically.  I sincerely doubt we will enough power to<br>
equal the universe (let alone rule it) for many, many millenia...if ever.<br>
<p>
        It is one large error on humanity's part that we think humans are<br>
everything.  We are not everything.  There is so much out there that we have<br>
not yet seen.  Often, our ignorance unknowingly blinds us to many<br>
possibilities and probabilities.  Who can accurately say that "Survival can<br>
be the only ethic in this universe"?  How about exploration?  That is an<br>
ethic that is within humanity; chances are, it is in many other<br>
extra-terrestrial species as well.  Survival is not an ethic, it is an<br>
instinct.  It is an instinct that is embedded in our subconscious mind, but<br>
when our mind consciously forfeits this instinct, we die.  Sure, we want to<br>
survive in the universe, but don't we want to explore, see more, and be more<br>
because of new knowledge as well?  I know I do.  As humans, we should not<br>
make closed-minded assumptions (and, as always, no offense to anyone here)<br>
about what *is* and *is not* in the universe.  When we know something...and<br>
I mean really grok it in fullness...then we can say that A *is* A in the<br>
situation, otherwise, we may get it all wrong.<br>
