 I am puzzled at your suggestion that "random circumstances" and "false<br>
beliefs" are in any way inconsistent with SO. Randomness is often an<br>
essential part of SOs such as genetic programming and neural networks,<br>
and the role of random trial and error in economic change should not be<br>
ignored. An ant colony can organize with false beliefs or no beliefs on<br>
the part of the ants, but accurate beliefs are needed for central planners<br>
to create a non-spontaneous order.<br>
 Ask yourself, for example, whether the FDA is the result of congressmen<br>
thoughtlessly reacting to headlines, which happen to report deaths due<br>
to bad drugs more conspicuously than natural deaths due to lack of drugs<br>
(a SO explanation of the FDA), or the result of people consciously<br>
calculating that their power is more important than the prompt availability<br>
of new drugs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What are the principles or rules that govern</i><br>
<i>&gt;that ordering? In a market SO it's the private property rights and price</i><br>
<i>&gt;signals that make up the SO. I'm not sure what it would be in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the development of governments.</i><br>
<p>
 What are the rules that govern the evolution of wings? The response<br>
of our immune systems to a new virus? Beyond the principle that entities<br>
which expand/reproduce tend to dominate a system, I see no reason to<br>
expect clear or simple rules.<br>
