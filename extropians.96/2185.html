First of all, thanks to Twirlip of Greymist and Anders Sandberg for <br>
the references.  I don't read much SF but I think it's time to check out <br>
Vinge.  <br>
<p>
I posed the question, <br>
<p>
:: What if the civilizations are not 100 light years apart?  What if they <br>
:: are on the same planet?    <br>
<p>
What I'm getting at is that Vinge may have been using allegories to <br>
write about something that is already happening, right here on earth, <br>
and has been happening for a long time.  Television, for example, is a <br>
perversion attack.  <br>
<p>
Anders writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A perversion war would be *fast* on a planet (and the chilling thing </i><br>
<i>&gt; is that many nations are gearing up for it - information warfare is </i><br>
<i>&gt; HOT  right now), and probably would be over quickly - leaving </i><br>
<i>&gt; more normal kinds of conflict.  </i><br>
<p>
I don't think so.  Memetic warfare is anything but fast.  It takes <br>
centuries.  <br>
<p>
I guess most people haven't been on the list long enough to remember <br>
the "memes (propagationism)" thread.  Monotheism has been <br>
attacking other memes for almost 3,000 years.  The war isn't over yet.  <br>
The outcome is far from clear.  <br>
<p>
