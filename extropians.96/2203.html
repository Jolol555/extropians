Hehe!  "Rightful owner", that's rather funny.  It's nothing like as simple<br>
as you paint it, David, and the pro-property position is just as logically<br>
unsound as the comunal position may be distasteful.  There are no intrinsic<br>
rights and wrongs in this, only accommodations made between people.<br>
<p>
Take a very common situation as an example of the fluidity of the concept<br>
of "rightful ownership".  Say you have a car, fully paid for.  Sadly, you<br>
did not pay your local council tax, and the bailiffs come and take your<br>
car away.  What gives?  Surely you were its "rightful owner" (tm), and no<br>
act of petty local government can change that!! :-)<br>
<p>
Actually, there is of course no such thing as intrinsic ownership of<br>
anything, not even our bodies nor ideas.  We're simply in possession<br>
of some items for the while that circumstances or other people permit.<br>
Even individualists realize that, despite being distinct individuals,<br>
they are also part of a universe within which "ownership" of atoms or<br>
atomic arrangements is a hilariously ridiculous notion.<br>
