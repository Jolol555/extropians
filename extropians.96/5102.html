<i>&gt; This sounds like a great idea!  I'd like to try writing such a program in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Java.  Is that an easy thing to do?  I've taken an introductory Java class,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I've never programmed my Mac before, and this seems like a golden</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity to learn.  What would I need other than the free Java software</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Sun (I think it runs on the Mac)?  I have a book on Java -- I assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; I need one on Mac programming (or do I -- it _is_ supposed to be portable).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any suggestions of which one is best?</i><br>
<p>
You don't need a book on Macintosh programming, not even remotely.  Be<br>
sure to use double-buffering so the image doesn't flicker.  Maybe I'll<br>
write an applet version and stick it on the 'Net - I wouldn't think it<br>
would take more than a few moments.  I'm not sure you could do more than<br>
60/75 words/second.  I don't know what my current reading speed is,<br>
probably between 1000 and 2000 WPM, so if I can actually get 60<br>
words/sec or even 30 words/sec it ought to be enough.<br>
<p>
Those of us who have studied reading will recall that the eye looks<br>
ahead two words, so you might need to display the next two words as<br>
well.<br>
