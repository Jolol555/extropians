<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;any way you could determine which one was uploaded quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;and which one was not? If the Scientific Method can not find</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;any difference we must conclude that there is no difference,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;or we will sink into the swamp of metaphysics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;superstition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Michael:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;TO the two people you uploaded by different means, it makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;a world of difference. The guy you flash uploaded is dead,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;and his simulacrum thinks he is the original.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes so you say, but what proof do you have to back it up? The Scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; Method demands evidence, and in this case you don't have the tiniest particle</i><br>
<i>&gt; of it, you don't even have unscientific testimonials, every one of the fast</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploads says everything is fine and they are the same person they  ever were.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless you believe in the mumbo jumbo that religion has to say about the soul</i><br>
<i>&gt; (in which case I don't see why you'd be interested in Science or this list),</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness MUST be generated by physical means. All uploads are physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems, if the Scientific Method can not find a difference between an unload</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is made quickly and one made slowly, then Science says that there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I don't beleive the mumbo jumbo, however, you have not presented ANY<br>
evidence that the original entity, the meaty one, will not have an<br>
abrupt cessation of awareness of this universe, i.e. death. I would<br>
agree to the assertion that the uploaded mind would have a continuous<br>
stream of awareness from bio to electro, but any perfect copy should by<br>
definition do so. You have not presented any evidence that if I were to<br>
do a flash upload, that my "stream of conciouness" that I consider to be<br>
"me" would not cease, even though there would be a perfectly operating<br>
electronic copy of me insisting that it feels fine.<br>
<p>
Since we are nowhere near the technological level to do any of this, it<br>
is rather a waste of breath to continue arguing about it, since neither<br>
of use knows enough to make an informed statement as to its truth or<br>
veracity. And in any case, I believe that the technology for slow<br>
gradual uploads will develop much sooner than a flash upload capability. <br>
<p>
Frankly, you sound more like a religious dogmatic, willing to take a<br>
leap of faith, than I. I at least want to test the waters first, to make<br>
sure it works. Tell me: Are you so positive that you would flash upload<br>
this instant, given the chance?<br>
