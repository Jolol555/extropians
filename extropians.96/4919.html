It depends. On your programming style, e.g. I was argumenting from the <br>
position of tiny grain sizes (WSI constraint), and an asychronous OOP <br>
with high call density, aka threaded code (tiny grains need dense code). <br>
Here nanokernel is virtually indistinguishable from the virtual machine. <br>
SEND_MSG is invoked very often, thus becoming a hot spot. You don't have <br>
resources for a true MMU on such architectures (it would also slow <br>
execution down), so automagical swapping out is not an alternative, anyway.<br>
The kernel space must be protected, of course. But those of the threads <br>
are not, they are protected by being distributed over several nodes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; only gave you very limited non-portable facilities so that you could</i><br>

<p>
I would denote this by nanokernel, since several-100-KByte OSses (as Mach) <br>
are also called microkernels. Nanokernels are not portable, they must be <br>
written from scratch. Nanokernels are _less_ portable than the average <br>
UNIX kernel is, anyway. They have been invented for a different reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; that all your device drivers fit in 12k. How often is the message-passing</i><br>
<p>
Nanokernels do not contain device drivers. A purely computational node <br>
hasn't got any devices, anyway. Lowest common denominator.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; code called? </i><br>
<p>
I can't give you exact data, but (depending on the programming style) -- <br>
very often. I suggest you check out the URLs I posted earlier, there <br>
should be a profiler there, somewhere.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;, having an address in address space (cache</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; has none, it occupies the same address space as the addressable core)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some chips let supervisor-mode software lock lines in the cache so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they always map to one specific address, effectively allowing you to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; it as on-chip RAM. I'm fairly sure that the T9000 transputer can do this</i><br>
<p>
Effectively yes, but it is slower, and the machinery is still there -- <br>
on-die transistors are not cheap. <br>
<p>
T9000 is mythical, anyway.<br>
<p>
