In case it is not clear to a non-native speaker of English, "the deep"<br>
is an idiom meaning the deep ocean.  So "a fire upon the deep" brings<br>
to mind a picture of a fire burning upon the ocean, a paradoxical image<br>
which makes the title interesting and intriguing.<br>
<p>
In the context of the story, the galaxy has four zones: the unthinking<br>
depths, the slow zone, the beyond, and the transcend.  The region of the<br>
beyond corresponds to the ocean, with the beyond/transcend boundary<br>
being like the surface of the ocean and the slow zone/beyond boundary<br>
being like the ocean floor.  Much nautical terminology is used to<br>
extend this analogy; for example, ships equipped to work near the slow<br>
zone are called "bottom luggers" and ones which scoop into the slow<br>
zone "dredges".<br>
<p>
The "fire" then is the straumli perversion, the super intelligence<br>
which is taking over a considerable portion of the transcend and the<br>
upper beyond, threatening to penetrate even deeper into the beyond.<br>
I believe the term "fire" is used here mostly to describe its destructive<br>
properties, as well as emphasizing the unique ability of the perversion<br>
to penetrate the beyond, which such attackers normally can't do, just<br>
as fire normally can't burn within water.  So the paradoxical imagery<br>
of the title is matched by the unique events related in the story.<br>
