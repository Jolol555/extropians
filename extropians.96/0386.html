I'd like to raise the precision of this discussion a bit, focusing on what<br>
seems to me the most likely candidate for the Great Filter in the past. In<br>
the latest version of your paper, you mention that  of the itemized steps,<br>
the one that took the longest span of time (about two billion years, if<br>
prokaryotes originated on Earth) was the jump from simple to complex<br>
single-cell life. Am I safe in assuming that this means the same thing as<br>
the jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life?<br>
<p>
Given the Mars life evidence, which seems to be purely prokaryotic, we<br>
could even conjecture that the universe is strewn with prokaryotic life,<br>
and that the stuff has been scattering around by panspermia since shortly<br>
after the Big Bang cooled.<br>
<p>
Then the only prima facie evidence we seem to have indicates that the Great<br>
Filter is probably the jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life. The only<br>
evolutionary model of this jump that I know of is Lynn Margulis's<br>
endosymbiotic theory.<br>
<p>
For a non-authoritative background discussion, you might look at<br>
<p>
        <a href="http://dekalb.dc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/students/w96/joshbond/symb.htm">http://dekalb.dc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/students/w96/joshbond/symb.htm</a><br>
<p>
noting that Kwang Jeon's results were obtained with amoebas, organisms<br>
which had *already* learned the trick of endosymbiosis. Spontaneous origin<br>
of endosymbiosis among *prokaryotes* seems unlikely to me for the following<br>
hunch-ridden reasons.<br>
<p>
Consider that all prokaryotic life is going to have some sort of immune<br>
system or digestive system (these specialized terms, devised for<br>
multicellular eukaryotes, would both metaphorically apply to the single and<br>
much simpler moneran system I'm talking about here). Consider that ordinary<br>
selection pressure would push for the ruthless effectiveness of that<br>
system. Consider that the ability to utilize "internal symbiotes" such as<br>
mitochondria and the like could develop only in the event of what amounts<br>
to a drastic *failure* of that system. It seems to me that by the very<br>
nature of "immune systems", especially in very simple organisms such as<br>
prokaryotes, the vast majority of such failures are going to be lethal<br>
mutations.<br>
<p>
The jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, then, would be a mutation or<br>
a sequence of mutations that resulted in a nonlethal total failure of the<br>
prokaryotic immune system. This notion seems sufficiently paradoxical to me<br>
that I'm content, for the time being, to identify the jump from prokaryote<br>
to eukaryote as the Great Filter.<br>
<p>
But then, perhaps I'm just being a dynamic optimist.  ;)  Counterexamples<br>
to my notion might include deliberate suppression of the human immune<br>
system to enable organ transplants. But this, of course, is a consequence<br>
of memetic evolution. Within the pure context of genetic evolution, I<br>
suspect that nonlethal total failures of the "immune system" among<br>
organisms as simple as prokaryotes would be extremely rare.<br>
<p>
The other possible counterargument, as Robin points out, is that the<br>
mutation took only two billion years (on Earth) to happen. But if the<br>
prokaryotic panspermia idea is right, and there are prokaryotes as thick as<br>
mud throughout the universe, then we could say that the Great Filter<br>
mutation took more like ten to fifteen billion years to take place, and<br>
just happened to take place on Earth. From this, it would seem that<br>
universally-panspermic prokaryotes (and the Mars life evidence) would<br>
strengthen my argument identifying the Great Filter with the evolution of<br>
eukaryotic endosymbiosis.<br>
<p>
If there are any expert students of protists and monerans out there who are<br>
really up on their phylogenetic studies, please correct any errors I've<br>
made.<br>
