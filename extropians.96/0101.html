Libertarianism, as something fairly well-defined and understood, is a<br>
political ideology, not a system of morality. I'm one libertarian (among<br>
many) who strongly values compassion.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;But even if one DOES exalt</i><br>

<p>
But the debate is not really about some broad abstract generality such as<br>
"eliminating government". The debate is really about legalizing pot, doing<br>
away with preposterous subsidies, ending barriers to peaceful job-seeking<br>
immigrants, minimizing tax rates, and other specific policy proposals. In<br>
each specific policy proposal, there is little question that the policy<br>
move recommended by libertarians would bring about a net reduction in the<br>
operation of coercion in society. On those specific policy issues in which<br>
the possible net reduction in coercion is uncertain or hazy, libertarians<br>
do not take strong policy stands. That's part of what "libertarian" means.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;An interesting point, to me, is that when we move to a TRANS-HUMAN</i><br>
<i>&gt;society, the balance between these different values will be different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the basic values will NOT change -- freedom, growth and compassion,</i><br>

<i>&gt;any essential way (I think).  But the parameters governing the balance</i><br>
<i>&gt;of parameters against each other will change.</i><br>
<p>
This is not really new. The balance of the various parameters of value<br>
already differs from person to person, and from culture to culture.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Everything we know about politics now -- libertarianism, Democrats,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Republicans, communists, socialists, etc. -- is implicitly conditioned</i><br>
<i>&gt;on human biology and 2-D earth life.  Each of these sociopolitical systems</i><br>
<i>&gt;represents a certain balance among important values, emphasizing some</i><br>
<i>&gt;and de-emphasizing others.  But the way the balances work out is going</i><br>
<i>&gt;to change when we leave our bodies behind!  \</i><br>
<p>
The whole idea behind libertarian political ideology is that different<br>
people have different balances among the various values they hold, and in<br>
many cases hold entirely different values, and that they should each be<br>
allowed the freedom to use their own bodies and property in the pursuit of<br>
those values. The whole idea behind the libertarian political ideology is<br>
that the element of force not be used to impose a common morality on all,<br>
that it should be used only to enforce the minimum morality needed for<br>
people with widely diverse value systems to coexist peacefully.<br>
<p>
So your trying to make out that libertarianism is somehow opposed to some<br>
alternate value system misses the point. The only value systems that<br>
libertarianism opposes are the ones which seek to impose themselves on<br>
unwilling participants by force.<br>
<p>
If you can point out a clear case of nongovernmental coercion in society,<br>
the libertarian minarchists (at least) will heartily endorse the use of<br>
government to minimize that coercion. But you've got to make a clear case<br>
that the coercion is going on in the first place before you can invoke a<br>
libertarian government to step in and stop it.<br>
