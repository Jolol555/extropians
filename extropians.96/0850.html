&lt;Arcologies!! Imagine having a 50 story view looking down on a<br>
rainforest? Cool.&gt;<br>
<p>
The economics of the architecture requires that most people wouldn't get<br>
any kind of view at all, living and working in the interior.   Secondly, if<br>
people were allowed "ouside" for recreation, that rainforest would get<br>
trampled for some distance.  (What population density are we talking<br>
about in this archology?)  I get the feeling we're only two-dimensional<br>
hive creatures, taking it to all three, a full hive, is likely to result in a great<br>
deal of psychological dysfunction.  There's too much monkey left in us. <br>
BTW, if that window view of nature is so important to your determination<br>
of "cool", doesn't it seem likely that a connection to nature is somehow<br>
necessary to the human psyche, perhaps more than an archology can<br>
offer.  How about this line?  "Arcologies!!  Imagine having a view looking<br>
at all that plumbing and airvents? Cool."  Not quite the same romantic<br>
effect is it?<br>
<p>
I go for the solution of more space or less people.<br>
<p>
Now mile high buildings within a traditional city are another matter.  That's<br>
cool!  (But who will put up with a five minute elevator ride several times a<br>
day?)<br>

Okay, I know Max Moore is going to pummel me on this one, but are we<br>
all sticking to the party line that FTL travel is really impossible?  Even<br>
teleportation?<br>
<p>
It's a question that severely effects the economics of all growth.<br>
<p>
Here's an informal poll?  What do you all consider the comfortable<br>
carrying capacity of the planet?  Not the maximum.  <br>
<p>
My feeling is that if we're talking about a population of universal material<br>
affluence and an individualist culture--I say about two billion.  (I like<br>
urbanism.)<br>
<p>
Your opinion, anyone?<br>
