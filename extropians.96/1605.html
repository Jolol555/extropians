Various measures of computer cost and speed have had a roughly<br>
constant growth rate over four decades (or more?)  During this time<br>
the world economy has doubled (more than once?) the computer industry<br>
has doubled many times, and computers are lots more available.  Thus<br>
this growth rate does not seem especially sensitive to the size of the<br>
world economy or the computer industry, or to computer availability.<br>
Or perhaps it is senstive, but such effects are just about canceled<br>
out by the computer design problem slowly getting harder.<br>
<p>
It sounds like you think this growth rate is sensitive to "researcher<br>
intelligence".  Note though that the growth rate hasn't changed much<br>
even though computer companies now hire lots more researchers than<br>
they once did, because the industry is larger, and though they could<br>
have instead hired the same number of researchers that they did at the<br>
beginning but made sure they were the IQ cream of the crop.  So that<br>
degree of IQ difference doesn't seem to make much difference in the<br>
growth rate.  And note that the average researcher today is smarter<br>
than the average one 40 years ago, because humanity knows so much<br>
more.  And note that researchers today have access to lots more<br>
computers than they once did, and that hasn't made much difference.<br>
<p>
So you posit an effect of researcher IQ on computer growth rates that<br>
can not be substituted for by hiring more researchers, or by having<br>
them know more, and that is not very strong for small IQ differences.<br>
So at what level of increased IQ do you expect this effect to kick in?<br>
And you posit an effect of more computer access on IQ that we haven't<br>
seen yet.  So at what level of computerization do you expect this<br>
effect to kick in?  And why should we believe in either of these<br>
not-yet-observed effects?<br>
