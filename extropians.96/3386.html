<i>&gt; I know Pawlicki. I also know that he had a live demonstration on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Canadian Public Radio of his demonstrator. It did work, though it was so</i><br>
<i>&gt; imbalanced and poorly designed that it self destructed once it finished</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few trips across the room.</i><br>
<p>
Such a mechanism can easily give the illusion of working when it is <br>
applied to a vehicle that has even a little static friction.  The <br>
more intense and shorter duration "pulse" of force as the weight goes <br>
through the fast part of it's path can overcome static friction <br>
(aka "stiction") better than the longer duration slow part of the <br>
cycle.  I'd bet that oiling the wheels of Pawlicki's machine, or <br>
placing it on an air track, would greatly worsen it's performance, <br>
thus disolving the illusion.  IMHO, Pawlicki is either suffering from <br>
a serious case of self delusion, or is a deliberate quack.  I don't <br>
want to get into speculating about which of these is the case.<br>
