I think spontaneous order is an especially tough one for people to grasp.<br>
Any help ExI can give in getting people to understand it will probably be<br>

I agree. Besides, as I noted in my reply to Lyle, Extropianism does not<br>
attempt to be a complete philosophy. The Principles say nothing specifically<br>
about pancritical rationalism. Personally, I think PCR extremely fitting<br>
with the general extropian emphasis on critical thinking, experimentation,<br>
anti-dogmatism, etc. However, someone might just as well have come to<br>
Extropian conclusions on the basis of a different approach, including the<br>
Objectivist axiomatic approach.<br>

<i>&gt;Kurt Rongey:</i><br>
<i>&gt;For what it's worth, I'm relatively free of technical understanding </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the scientific issues.  I spent the first quarter-century of my </i><br>

<p>
I agree and think that as the years go by we will see a growing number who<br>
hold themselves to be Extropian or extropian but who aren't especially<br>
technically knowledgeable. Clearly, since many of our discussions in the<br>
existing forums involve technology, we tend to attract those who are<br>
technically sophisticated, or philosophically sophisticated. I suspect that<br>
there are more extropian types to be found involved with tech, especially<br>
exciting, rapidly advancing tech. Promethean minded people often find these<br>
areas attractive.<br>
<p>
I enjoyed and appreciated your comments Kurt.<br>
