  Reuter excerpt:<br>
<p>
  TWA flight 800 shot by US missile, Salinger says <br>
<p>
  20:37 Nov 07, 1996 EST <br>
<p>
  NICE, France, Nov 8 (Reuter) - Former White House adviser Pierre <br>
  Salinger said on Thursday that a U.S. Navy missile accidentally <br>
  shot down the TWA    airliner which crashed off New York in July <br>
  killing all 230 people aboard. <br>
<p>
  Salinger told airline officials an agent of the U.S. secret service <br>
  gave him a document in Paris showing the airliner had entered an <br>
  area where the U.S. Navy was carrying out missile tests. <br>
<p>
  ``The airliner was not the target of an attack...It was shot down <br>
  by a missile fired from a U.S. Navy vessel,'' he said. <br>
<p>
  He said the airliner had taken off late from New York and was flying <br>
  lower than its scheduled altitude of 20,000 feet to steer clear of <br>
  another aircraft. <br>
<p>
  The airport control tower, in ``a tragic error,'' failed to inform <br>
  the Navy, Salinger said. <br>
<p>
  ``The truth must come out,'' he said. <br>

<p>
<p>
IAN: When I think of the avalanche of vicious ad hominem abuse <br>
I took in the newsgroups for simply suggesting EXACTLY what Former <br>
White House adviser Pierre Salinger has now come out and said to <br>
be true from first hand knowledge, it proves what a bunch of fact-<br>
blind GovtMedia news feeding and worshiping zombies most people <br>
are. This PROVES we are feed a pack of lies; this PROVES that the <br>
U.S. media is guilty of a conspiracy to suppress the truth in <br>
defense of the U.S. govt because all the facts necessary to <br>
reach the this just revealed truth have been there from day <br>
one (notice that this news comes from Reuters in England); and <br>
this proves that the bulk of conspiracy researchers quickly and <br>
accurately divulged the real scoop and were smeared viciously <br>
for doing so. If you want to get closest to the truth, research <br>
conspiracy theory sources.<br>
<p>
I laid this TWA 800 GovtMedia scam story all out, see: <br>
<p>
        <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm</a><br>
<p>
Also see my (9/28/96) TWA 800 article in The Goddard Chronicles<br>
at DEEP TIMES:<br>
<p>
        <a href="http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/">http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard/</a><br>
<p>
Hell, ya got to toot your horn a little, particularly after <br>
being sh*t on so much for getting the truth out, for example:<br>
<p>
The current issue of GEORGE Magazine smears people who suggest<br>
that the govt may have shot-down TWA 800 as clueless paranoids.<br>
They even quote me. Yet I gave them the facts, culled right out <br>
of quickly disappearing media quotations, that 156 witnesses re-<br>
ported seeing a missile hit the plane and GEORGE Magazine censored <br>
these facts that they had in hand, and then they turn around and <br>
call those who know the facts, which they also know, "clueless." <br>
It's a naked con job. <br>
<p>
As Former White House adviser Pierre Salinger just said:<br>
<p>
        ``The truth must come out.''<br>
<p>
Yet I'll bet this report too will just disappear, and anyone <br>
who remembers it will also be a "clueless paranoid nut case." <br>
