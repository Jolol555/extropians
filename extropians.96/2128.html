Come on.  The reason I am not willing to make such a statement is that I<br>
(like most people) don't have the time to carefully read and analyze all<br>
50+ posts per day.<br>
<p>
If you can assure me that during this experiment the AI is operating<br>
completely on its own, and the "real person" is not permitted to post to<br>
rescue the AI from giving itself away, then I can describe a test that<br>
would resolve this question (assuming all of the humans cooperate).<br>
<p>
The fact the "AI" is using a borrowed identity also suggests it has some<br>
serious weaknesses.  Really, what you are telling us is it is imitating<br>
someone -- not "thinking" for itself.<br>
