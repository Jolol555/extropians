Well, not exactly.<br>
<p>
But now that I have your attention &lt;g&gt;, I'd like to bring up a topic close<br>
to my heart: personal communications.<br>
<p>
No, I am not talking about interpersonal relations.  (I'm what you might<br>
call an outgoing loner.)<br>
<p>
In his book _How The World Was One_, Arthur C. Clarke quotes a<br>
little-known, turn-of-the-century science fiction writer describing the<br>
future of telecommunications.  In essence, the sci-fi write concludes that<br>
in the future, telecommunications will be so ubiquitous, so reliable, and<br>
so personal that if you try to call someone and they don't answer, you will<br>
know they must be dead.  (Or frozen?)<br>
<p>
My theory is that we are now beginning a second "PC revolution" -- only<br>
this time the PC is the personal communicator.  (Although it is also very<br>
much a computer.)  I believe that within the next decade, on a global<br>
basis, wireless communicators will become as common as TVs, tape players,<br>
and alarm clock radios.  In developed countries, most people will own more<br>
than one.  In less developed countries, they will be quite common -- some<br>
third-world governments will sustain their people's dependancy by giving<br>
the phones away "free."<br>
<p>
Sorry, but there is a "conspiracy theory" lurking even here. (!)<br>
Yesterday, a major milestone was achieved with the rollout of a new type of<br>
personal communications service in 11 cities across the U.S., based on a<br>
technology called Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).  CDMA -- which has<br>
its roots in jam-proof/secure military communications -- was invented by a<br>
San Diego-based company, Qualcomm, Inc.<br>
<p>
CDMA is a wonderfully unique technology.  In fact, it seems to defy all of<br>
the traditional rules of radio communications.  Most engineers were taught,<br>
and have scrupuously followed, the rule that the only way to accommodate<br>
multiple conversations over the airwaves was to put different conversations<br>
on different frequencies.  In fact, it was obvious to any "good engineer"<br>
that putting different conversations on the same frequency at the same time<br>
was a sure-fire recipe for causing severe interference.<br>
<p>
Cellular radio defied this rule just a little, by reusing frequencies at<br>
safe distances (using relatively low power radios).<br>
<p>
CDMA throws the rule completely out the window.  It intentionally puts all<br>
of the conversations right on top of each other.  In fact, it requires that<br>
all of the signals from portable handsets arrive at the base station at the<br>
exact same power level -- a state of affairs that would normally guarantee<br>
100% interference, rendering meaningful communications impossible.<br>
<p>
However, each of the conversations is digitized (i.e., the voices are sent<br>
as bit streams) and assigned a unique "code."  The base station receiver<br>
picks up all of the signals at once; a computer is able to distinguish and<br>
separate the different conversations by "decoding" the composite bit<br>
stream.<br>
<p>
To the CDMA engineer, this means designing a radio network in which the<br>
base stations must control the transmit power of every handset to within an<br>
extremely fine tolerance -- no easy thing to do since signals received from<br>
mobile handsets naturally vary more than ten thousand-fold due to fading<br>
and multipath interference (i.e., signals taking different paths and<br>
recombining at the receiver out-of-phase).<br>
<p>
However, if one can make power control work it delivers significant<br>
advantages to the end-user.  Since the handset is continually compensating<br>
for fading by adjusting its transmit power -- thousands of times each<br>
second -- the hissing and fluttering sound normally associated with<br>
cellular telephone completely vanishes.  CDMA phones sound very much like<br>
desktop phones; some people will refuse to believe you are calling them<br>
from your car.  And there is another beneficial side-effect of granular<br>
power control: it greatly extends handset battery life.<br>
<p>
Now to the "conspiracy."  For the last few years, some of my colleagues in<br>
the telecommunications industry have doubted that this technology could be<br>
successfully commercialized anytime soon.  Some have even claimed the<br>
entire thing is a "fraud" merely designed to run up Qualcomm's stock price.<br>
So as major manufacturers began licensing the technology, and network<br>
operators began to embrace it, some "experts" came to the conclusion there<br>
must be some sort of conspiracy at work.  They began talking about how a<br>
secret "CDMA mafia" was fooling some -- and coercing others -- into<br>
believing this was a legitimate technology.<br>
<p>
Well, I now have one of these CDMA personal communication phones in hand<br>
and it does work.  Sound quality is excellent.  Due to its enhanced battery<br>
life, you can leave the phone on all day.  (Actually, it can be left in<br>
standby for two days, or you can talk for four hours, or some combination<br>
inbetween.)  Initial prices are 10% - 15% less than cellular telephone.<br>
However, CDMA claims ten times the capacity of conventional cellular, so<br>
prices will probably go much lower as competition heats up.  It is also<br>
easy to provide features like caller ID over an end-to-end digital network,<br>
so they are part of the standard package.  Some of the conspiracy theorists<br>
are now buying time for themselves by focusing on CDMA's capacity claims,<br>
saying the technology will blow up in operators' faces *later* -- as they<br>
bring more subscribers online.<br>
<p>
In this case, the "conspiracy theory" is really just the predictable<br>
reaction of the radio communication industry's equivalent of The Flat Earth<br>
Society.  It is peddled mainly by old-guard engineers (plus a couple of<br>
well-known Stanford professors) who simply can't accept the shift from a<br>
separate-frequency to a same-frequency paradigm.<br>
<p>
There is also much progress being made toward accessing the Net via<br>
wireless phones.  AT&amp;T is now selling a product called "PocketNet Phone"<br>
that retrieves intelligently-filtered text from Web pages.  Nokia has<br>
introduced a phone with a somewhat larger screen and built-in Web browser.<br>
If there is interest, perhaps I can post more on this later...<br>
