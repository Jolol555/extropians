<i>&gt; From:          mlbowli1@cord.iupui.edu</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any other Numanoids out there, past or present?.  As far as I know, I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt; the only person in North America who is aware of anything other than </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Cars.'     </i><br>
<p>
I was in high school when I first heard Gary Numan perform "Cars" and<br>
another song (Praying To The Aliens?) I think on Saturday Night Live.<br>
I was always interested in most anything that was innovative or<br>
really different, and still am (most of the other kids thought I was<br>
pretty weird, but I got along with most of them ok anyway).  I took<br>
an immediate liking to Numan's music and have four of his albums<br>
("The Pleasure Principle", "Telekon", "Dance" and "I, Assassin").  I<br>
also have stuff by Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, David Byrne, Laurie<br>
Anderson, Devo, Synergy, Japan, Vangelis, Jean Michael Jarre,<br>
Tomita, Tangerine Dream and other innovative artists from that time<br>
period. I've always leaned towards music that has a futuristic theme,<br>
or that at least challenges the status quo.  I guess that's why I<br>
took a liking to punk rock.  It isn't extropic, but it does at least<br>
challenge people to think for themselves.  Bands like The Sex<br>
Pistols, Dead Kennedys, The Clash, Circle Jerks, 999 and The Dickies<br>
are some old favorites. <br>
<p>
All of these artists had a substantial influence in becoming who I<br>
am.  Not so much in the actual ideas that were presented (though I<br>
found some the ideology worthwhile), but more in that it prompted a<br>
re-examination of the belief system that had been instilled in me by<br>
family, friends, school and society at large.<br>
<p>
Art, and especially music, is a very powerful force in shaping<br>
individuals and society. It can have either good or bad results.  So<br>
those who want to use art to influence future society must use it<br>
carefully.  I think that the most important thing that one person can<br>
"teach" or otherwise induce in another person is the desire and<br>
ability to think critically not only about the physical world, but<br>
about their own belief system and the mores of their society as well.<br>
Sometimes the influence of art can be positive even if the message<br>
is negative. So long as it influences the observer to think<br>
independently and to challenge even his/her own views. <br>
