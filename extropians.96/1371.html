Rich Artym: <br>
<i>&gt;Well, I've tried twice now, but you still evade the point completely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's not just the products that will become easy and cheap to produce,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the blinking MEANS OF PRODUCTION too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i><br>
<p>
Robin Hanson replies:<br>
<i>&gt; I'll say this one last time.  These are just baldface claims, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have not bothered to argue for.</i><br>
<p>
Rich again: <br>
<i>&gt; Well, there we have it:  you don't want to address the fact that </i><br>
<i>&gt; placing the means of production into the hands of everyman </i><br>
<i>&gt; and making the cost of the means of production tend towards zero </i><br>
<i>&gt; both completely undermine the existing economic structures </i><br>
<i>&gt; by removing the trade that drives them.</i><br>
<p>
This remark simply demonstrates that Extropian posts can be written <br>
by entities with less-than-human intelligence.  I think there must be <br>
some kind of automated factory which generates these posts.  As John <br>
Clark said, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Human judgment is not involved whenever one post needs to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; written to reply to another, very dumb automatic process do it for us.  </i><br>
<p>
Robin is not the one who is evading the issue.  Rich, you have not <br>
demonstrated that the means of production will be easy and cheap to <br>
produce.  You have not calibrated the idea of "placing the means of <br>
production into the hands of everyman."  <br>
<p>
If you could demonstrate that Extopian Nanotech will exist, then yes, <br>
obviously this would change the economic system.  But you don't even <br>
try to demonstrate your thesis, you just keep asserting it in <br>
capital letters.  You could post it in 36 point type, it would still be <br>
just an unsupported assertion.   <br>
