Yes, it's possible.  Current thought is that it would be very difficult to<br>
mix rRNA from different lines into one functional ribosome.  However,<br>
evolution of rRNAs is ill-understood.<br>

<p>
As I understand it, not only is there a lot of variation within eukaryotes,<br>
but eukaryotes as a group differ substantially from prokaryotes.  Multiple<br>
origins should leave most eukaryotes more closely related to their<br>
prokaryotic relatives than their eukaryotic non-relatives, but that isn't the<br>
case.<br>
