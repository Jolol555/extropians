Yes, it seems that the universal law is a digital one: exist or don`t <br>
exist.  I can definitely see ourselves creating our evolutionary <br>
successors.  But I`m not going to give up my existance without a <br>
fight, after I`ve help create these monsters, I`ll do everything in <br>
my power to stop them from wiping me out - but only after they have <br>
evoloved to the level where they have the option of doing so.  In <br>
self organizing systems, each component must believe that it is the <br>
best one, for the whole organism to remain healthy.<br>

<i>&gt; I love life.  Not just my life.  But Life.  The whole concept.  Things </i><br>
<i>&gt; mutating and adapting and competing.  Weeding out the inferior.  The whole </i><br>
<i>&gt; process.  I think it's great.  I just think that future life may look back on </i><br>
<i>&gt; us the way we look back on pre-cellular life.  Interesting, yes.  But only the </i><br>
<i>&gt; first step.  Just setting things up for the explosion.  Ancestral, but still </i><br>
<i>&gt; very primative.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It should be interesting to see how things develop -- for as long as I can </i><br>
<i>&gt; keep up, that is.</i><br>
<p>
YES! (Still in binary mode.)<br>
