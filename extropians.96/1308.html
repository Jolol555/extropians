          I suppose that there could be SIs that were not <br>
          corporations, at least if you take "corporation" in a narrow <br>
          sense as implying an economic nature of the group. I think <br>
          the term "SI", i.e. Synthetic Intelligence, was introduced <br>
          as an alternatilve to "AI" in order not to prejudice the <br>
          question whether the intelligence would be based on the <br>
          principles of classical AI. In the present discussion I <br>
          think what we have meant by "SI" has been: an entity very <br>
          much more intelligent than humans or existing groups of <br>
          humans (which should be "&gt;SI" or "&gt;AI", unless we take "SI" <br>
          to stand for Super Intelligence, which would be convenient.)<br>
