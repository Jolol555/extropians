<p>
I was three and a half.  I had been up all night the night before, <br>
helping Richard Feynman with some equations that were giving him <br>
trouble.  I finished the test in an hour, because I had to catch a plane   <br>
to New York.  I only had time for a brief nap before my debut <br>
at Carnegie Hall that night.   ;-)<br>
<p>
No, actually I was 17.  I took the test at the beginning of my senior <br>
year.  In those days the scores weren't rounded off, and the SAT wasn't <br>
given to 11 year olds.  <br>
<p>

<p>
Oh...   That explains a lot.  I'm impressed (with your posts, not your SATs).  <br>
Seriously, no sarcasm intended.  <br>
<p>
But I still say your statement is a non sequitur.  <br>
