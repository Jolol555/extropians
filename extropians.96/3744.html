Paul:<br>
In addition, in my view a<br>
<i>&gt;person who has high self esteemm, ie. is proud of all his/her thoughts and</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions should have no need for any privacy and, in fact, should be</i><br>
completely<br>
<i>&gt;happy to have these things all open to the public.</i><br>
<p>
Bravo... I think that is the correct stance, if you have <br>
nothing to hide, in fact much to be proud of, privacy isnt exactly a bargain.<br>
It could be, so to speak, harmful! <br>
Show you're above board, get the full benefits of who you<br>
are and all you have done!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wade comments:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think there may be a confusion on exactly what level we</i><br>
are discussing "privacy" on.  I understand what you're saying,<br>
that people who are intensely private are missing out on a lot,<br>
<p>
I dont think he meant that! I think he meant openness <br>
and availablitiy of information on demand. <br>
FOR EXAMPLE, for certain business a credit check, a <br>
PLUS not a minus, if you have nothing to hide, you dont<br>
need to have "privacy". I think Kenitta made a good point<br>
that people *need* the privacy of "person".<br>
That's basic human dignity, no one staring at you while <br>
you dress, no  hidden videocams in the shower, different subject.<br>
In other words Greta Garbo's  " I vant to be alone" should <br>
be respected.<br>
<p>
Paul again:<br>
<i>&gt;My basic point here is to question the rationality of anyone valuing</i><br>
privacy.<br>
<p>
J de Lyser:<br>
<i>&gt;IMO, privacy serves the individuality of people. Your idea is very noble,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the reality is that your 'altruism' may not be the same as someone elses</i><br>
altruism.<br>
<p>
I see no reason to accuse him of altruism here, he is<br>
saying he values rationality.  I thinks honesty, self <br>
esteem  and character are often confused with " altruism",<br>
becuase these virtues are actually "helpful" in the real sense of the word.<br>
Unlike Altruism, they do not depend on anyone else to self sustain.<br>
And altruism often tries to be helpful, yet fails miserably. <br>
<p>
I see your basic point - So, if one is "rational" , above boards , and needs<br>
less privacy because of it, and that ius abused by a party, then privacy or<br>
*protection* from an irrational influence may be in order. <br>
***Protection from invasive scrutiny or unhealthy interference should be the<br>
order of the day*** This is being confused with privacy IMHO.<br>
But in general I am in agreement with Paul, privacy isnt my thing, I am<br>
*same* public as private, no little secrets.<br>
Some of us are proud of hard work and self.... <br>
