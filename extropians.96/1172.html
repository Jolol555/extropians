I had said:<br>
<i>&gt;The phrase "dealing with that rationally" is one I wouldn't use... </i><br>
<i>&gt;"dealing with that wisely" might be closer to my goal. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Categories are very useful. So is the ability to think outside </i><br>
<i>&gt;the box. </i><br>

Jeff Dee said:<br>
I prefer not to make blanket <br>
reccomendations of subjective things like 'wisdom', because <br>
I can't know what they mean to the person I'm dealing with. <br>
On the other hand, there are pretty clear rules about what <br>
does and does not constitute rational thought.<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
Please re-read my comment.  I said "I prefer"--I did not make a <br>
blanket recommendation. As for those "pretty clear rules"--<br>
rational thought is prone to GIGO, tunnel vision, etc., and is a <br>
lossy/lousy way to deal with, e.g., sitting down on a hot stove.<br>
<p>
Jeff Dee said:<br>
Why do you think it isn't?  Why do you think <br>
the process of rational thought would keep you from adopting <br>
exactly the stance you already hold now?<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
Matter made entirely of hydrogen does not exhibit very much richness <br>
or complexity. If you can figure out what the first sentence of this <br>
paragraph is a metaphor for, how did you do it? Did you do it <br>
"rationally"? If you can't figure out the metaphor, I'll explain: <br>
Thinking that is limited to "rational" thought is a stark subset of <br>
the thinking I find interesting.<br>
<p>
Many people use the phrase "rational thought" to mean "rearranging <br>
their prejudices" or "thinking critically". The first is occasionally <br>
useful, the latter is more useful than the former, and neither one <br>
encompasses the entire gamut of useful thought.<br>
<p>
Jeff Dee said:<br>
This implies that 'if people only understood the 'why' and the deep <br>
structure, everything would be fine.  But I understand the 'why' and the <br>
deep structure - and I still think it's a load of crap.  The problem is not <br>
that students are having it spoon-fed to them.  That's unfortunate, but <br>
it's not the primary reason why it upsets me.<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
Great.  And is being upset a rational response? :) :) :&gt;<br>
To say "It" is a load of crap is to imply knowledge of what "it" is. <br>
I wonder whether we are talking about the same thing.<br>
<p>
You may be right.<br>
