My guess is that it is very hard, mostly because heat is a macroscopic <br>
phenomenon - if you just keep a single atom very still, have you created <br>
efficient cooling? And on the nanoscale, everything is jumping around.<br>
<p>
I think we need something like drexlerian nanotech for this, proteins<br>
don't work well when temperatures change.  In this problem, the hardest<br>
part seem to be how to insulate the vacuole from the surroundings. My<br>
suggestion would be a nano-dewar: two geodesic diamondoid spheres with<br>
vacuum between them, kept concentric by electrostatic forces.<br>
<p>
Pumping heat away from the inner sphere might be done using electron<br>
bombardment; I seem to recall that this was used to cool down atoms. On<br>
the outer sphere, nanostructures catch the electrons and send them in<br>
again in a carefully designed beam (this is the part that costs energy;<br>
entropy is pumped away using the electrons). <br>
<p>
I think this is a rather fun problem, but I don't see much use for it. <br>
What applications do you have in mind? <br>
