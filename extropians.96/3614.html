The November 25th issue of Time Magazine had a _cover story_ called<br>
(from memory) "How Science Is Searching for Ways to Keep Us Forever Young".<br>
I liked it pretty well, though I thought it was a bit pessimistic in its<br>
brief cryonics and nanotech section (mainly because it had a "reality check"<br>
that only talked about what (how little) had already been done).<br>
<p>
Check it out if you can.  It may be a reasonable intro to the topic of<br>
life extension for some of your more skeptical friends.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Kennita<br>
