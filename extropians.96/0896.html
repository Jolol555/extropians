Of course, this assumes non-homogenous systems, but I think we can safely<br>
assume it. Communication lags will make a distributed mind very slow unless<br>
its component parts have much autonomy. Most likely we will get a situation<br>
to a human brain: a possible system metamind, rather slow but setting the<br>
global goals, consisting of many smaller minds (which could be Jupiter<br>
brains) which in turn consists of smaller and smaller minds. <br>
<p>
It might not be certain that if the metamind decides it has grown enough <br>
the subminds will agree (even if we consciously understand that we have <br>
eaten enough our hypothalamic nuclei doesn't necessarily agree). But <br>
spreading to another system would be more equivalent to siring a child; <br>
the delays would make it a very separate mind. One possibility is of <br>
course a galaxy of system minds joined into a super-slow metamind, but <br>
this would take a very long time to realize.<br>
<p>
I don't see why subminds wouldn't set out on their own to grow into <br>
system minds. <br>
