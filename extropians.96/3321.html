No, there will be a whole lot more options to choose from. That will<br>
lead to choosing *the usal one* because the signal to noise ratio wil<br>
make it practically impossible to seperate good from bad products.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When one wishes to purchase a particular</i><br>

<i>&gt; the people who are selling whatever product one is interested in.  Computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks are excellent tools for matching up buyer and seller, and they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; become more widespread as more people recognize their value and use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer networks routinely.</i><br>
<p>
It will only work for certain types of products and from retailers that<br>
people know and trust. (would you buy The *Hi-octane* office package<br>
from *Gazoline software* instead of office 2010 from Microsoft?)<br>
We will still be selling goods and services to people. And people buy<br>
from people they know. They buy brands (made by big cooperations<br>
advertising) and they buy something because of word of mouth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The widespread use of computer networks will make it much easier to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-employed and contract one's services and talents out to those who offer</i><br>
<i>&gt; an agreeable trade, much like a free lance artist does.  It will become less</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary to have a "steady job", where one trades with the same person day</i><br>
<i>&gt; after day, and it will become easier and more secure for someone to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; several clients that they work for and multiple streams of income, so they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not dependent on any single source of income.</i><br>
<p>
I myself have worked that way, and your theory has some flaws. Those who<br>
makes the most money are usually close conncted to a single company.<br>
Those i know who are not, spend to much time trying to sell their<br>
skills. (And most of them don't like that part of their job. They wish<br>
they could have a sales force.)<br>
<p>
You are right that there will no longer be technical reasons why an<br>
individual shouldn't be able to compete with huge corporation. And it<br>
will also happen.<br>
<p>
If one person with a high level of skills makes a difference, then many<br>
high skilled workers  cooperating will make more of a difference. At my<br>
current job (a media an marketing company) we are not cheap. Our<br>
costumers know that. They also know that we are a group of talented<br>
individuals with a strong background in as diverse areas as marketing,<br>
video produktion, distribution.... all the things a large corporation<br>
need to sell and comunicate their services and products. Still they use<br>
us because we can do something that an individual cannot. (we have<br>
redundancy in our system for one thing, making us safer.)<br>
Instead of using us they could use individual subcontractors. But for<br>
every two or three subcontractors they would need somebody to keep an<br>
eye out on them. (Most people are note that talented and ned to be<br>
supervised closely not to make bad desicions.) There will then be no net<br>
profitt. just more FUD than if they chosed a *professional* solution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One could first hire a team</i><br>
<i>&gt; of engineers to plan the project and organize it into sub-projects.  Then one</i><br>
<i>&gt; could hire teams and individuals to complete the various sub-projects until</i><br>
<i>&gt; the greenhouses are built and food is being grown in them.  Then one would</i><br>
<i>&gt; receive requests for food and hire people to transport the food to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate places.</i><br>
<p>
This would all take a lot of money. A person with a lot of money<br>
wouldn't he hire e secretary to do the boring bits? Already there we are<br>
on the way from the single man comapny.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now it's becoming a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot easier for the average person to do, because computer networks are helping</i><br>
<i>&gt; to lower the costs of organizing a business.</i><br>
<p>
Large scale projects can still only be done by large groups with a lot<br>
of money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I predict that it will become increasingly less common</i><br>
<i>&gt; for someone to have a "steady job".</i><br>
<p>
Probably it will be more in the direction of people working at home for<br>
2-3 days a week. While they are still in a steady job.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it will seem foolish and dangerous to have only one major client</i><br>
<i>&gt; that one is dependent on for income.</i><br>
<p>
But a lot easyer than looking for work all the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a project manager, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; may find someone who consistently does excellent work, and you may hire them</i><br>
<i>&gt; regularly to work on various projects, and this will probably be common.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; that same person will likely have many other clients that they work for as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well.</i><br>
<p>
Or they will find someone else because the other guy is occupied to<br>
often.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Those who don't prove themselves to be such good workers will not receive such</i><br>
<i>&gt; high-paying offers for their work.  Of course, they could always hire someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; to teach them how to improve their skills and become a more excellent worker,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and thus improve their financial situation.</i><br>
<p>
How would they pay when they have a bad income (catch 22?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I believe that the widespread use of computer networks will create</i><br>
<i>&gt; even greater flexibility in people's lives and allow people many more options</i><br>
<i>&gt; for organizing their lives, including greater flexibility of who they work</i><br>
<i>&gt; for.  Technology is providing people the tools they need to take care of</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves better and manage their own lives.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with a lot of things you are saying, but we must keep in mind<br>
that it is only true in some situations and for some jobs.<br>
Small companies working together on large projects would need to much<br>
coordination and thus be inefficient. We are still humans that need to<br>
work and comunicate with other humans. Thats the most important thing to<br>
remember.<br>
<p>
The new way of working probably won't be a revolution but an evolution.<br>
People have worked together for may years now, and only a limited number<br>
of ways seem to be efficient. Of course technology will change<br>
something, but i don't think it will be a very radical departure.<br>
