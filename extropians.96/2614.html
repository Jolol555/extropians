how <br>
to be very creative and ingenious and make the most out of all my resources, <br>

<p>
wealth (and I mean literally, to CREATE it).  I'm planning on creating so<br>
much <br>
wealth that I will have lots to share, to help poor people everywhere, to <br>
teach them how to create their own wealth.  The creation of wealth benefits <br>
everyone, and so it will benefit me to teach lots of others how to create <br>
wealth for themselves (then there will be more people &gt;creating high-quality <br>
products for me to trade with).  The only way we can all be wealthy is if <br>
everyone learns to create their own wealth.  It won't happen by<br>
redistributing <br>
the wealth that some create to those who don't create wealth.  Everyone must <br>
take responsibility for their own lives and use the resources &gt;they have to<br>
add <br>
value to everything they can.  That is how we create wealth.<br>

Three cheers for your post D- I too take the dare. You put it  well. If<br>
there's anything I can do to help you, let me know. The high quality things I<br>
will create will be useful to you someday as well, thanks for your vote of<br>
confidence in my (our) ability.<br>
