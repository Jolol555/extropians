And for that matter, my desire to be accepted led me to do some rather<br>
ratty things.  Might have done more, but lacked the opportunities.  I<br>
could imagine the child I was growing into a cruel and nasty person<br>
himself, despite "knowing better".<br>

Yet children can also be far fairer and compassionate than your usual<br>
adult.  Sometime the same child (a la myself, perhaps) can be at both<br>
extremes at alternating times.  Heartless to a classmate, yet outraged<br>
at the sight of a homeless person.  Perhaps children naturally have a<br>
wider moral spectrum, which converges under societal pressure.  Hmm.<br>
That seems rather plausible.<br>
