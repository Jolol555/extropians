Count me as a capitalist. And my ancestors too. ; -) The English homesteaders<br>
and the Chinooks.  In fact the Chinook were the most respected trade epople<br>
of the Pacific Northwest.. especially the women were noted for their business<br>
expertise. <br>

I can give examples if you want:  The<br>
socialists "feel sorry" for me because I do not accept government<br>
entitlements.  It's a long story but I am not exactly (;-) attracting them as<br>
friends these days.  They want me to "fight" for more government money.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree. For profit is better than no profit ANYTIME.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The capitalists among us (who I am and others who I admire)  are starting</i><br>
businesses and supporting ourselves.  We don't like what they see as<br>
government "hand-outs".  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree 100%.  The government is not ( nor ever will be) handing out self<br>
esteem, self ownership *or* self empowerment.  <br>
