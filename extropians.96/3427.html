<i>&gt;        The values of spontaneous order seem to have been lost lately.  List</i><br>
<i>&gt;members don't seem to take action upon themselves to make our potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;kinetic.  I can understand the want for the time and situation to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;right...I agree wholeheartedly...but we cannot sit around wallowing in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;own stagnation of potentialities [not insinuating that we all are].</i><br>
<i>&gt;A lot of crap was dished out to Michael Lorrey for his new site (which I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have not yet seen).  I am not a physicist, but I respect Michael greatly for</i><br>
<i>&gt;his ability to *create*, whether or not it works (and I believe it shall!).</i><br>
<p>
I too believe that Mike Lorrey was dished out alot of crap that was totally<br>
unfair. In the case of spreading our memes, I have an analogy for this.<br>
Lets see how well I can explain it. The population is like fuel for a fire<br>
(meme fuel, hosts, whatever you want to call it). What we need to do is to<br>
create ignition, heat up the idea by spreading it until the point that it<br>
burns the fuel rapidly into a gigantic wildfire out of control. In this way<br>
it is also alot like creating the first controlled fusion reaction where<br>
the ignition is the difficult part because variables need to be *perfect*<br>
and continueing the reaction is the easy part. All you need is a spark to<br>
ignite a raging brushfire. Lets ignite that fire <br>
by selecting the people who would be most effective at spreading the memes,<br>
contacting them and add them to the collective of the group. (No BORG jokes)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        Chris Hind said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If I may speak for the group as a whole: Take action NOW! Do WHATEVER YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;CAN!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        I second that.  (Wow!  I'm actually agreeing with Chris for once</i><br>
<i>&gt;:-))  To quote a verse from one of my poems:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        I may never reach my goal</i><br>
<i>&gt;        My lunacy might take its toll</i><br>
<i>&gt;        But if perchance I ever die</i><br>
<i>&gt;        At least I had the balls to try</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry I never read that one. That _IS_ quite good. I never imagined<br>
we'd agree on something! hehe<br>
To quote the movie "Independence Day" "We can't be consumed by our petty<br>
differences anymore. We will be united in our common interest." This<br>
concludes that we should not bicker over the little things. Lets just get<br>
out there and do the damn stuff! Lets consider some of the things we can do<br>
with just a first glance.<br>
<p>
- Invest in extropian-related companies (nanotech, genetics)<br>
- Attend extropian meetings<br>
- How about we pick a night for an IRC meeting where we can discuss topics<br>
in near-realtime?<br>
<p>
Any others? Forget your criticisms for a moment! Lets work towards a better<br>
future!<br>
