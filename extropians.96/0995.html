<i>&gt;&gt;Nature is a far better engineer than any of us. Nature</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;engineers more complex and exotic stuff although much slower. We engineer</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;quickly but bulky and we will eventually completely surpass nature's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;engineering strengths but not now. The reason nature is a greater engineer</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is because it looks at a problem in infinite directions. Human engineers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;look to accomplish a certain task with a few variables but nature looks at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;infinite variables...</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is an interesting, and common, angle on nature: anthropomorphization</i><br>
<i>&gt;coupled with linguistic personification. Within a Darwinian framework I find</i><br>
<i>&gt;it hard to consider the workings of nature as a gestalt entity;</i><br>
I don't consider it a entity the concept is merely metaphorical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;rather, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;seems to be a series of interacting events in which there is no prior</i><br>
<i>&gt;assessment of effect, no plan. So 'nature' doesn't look at a problem in any</i><br>
<i>&gt;direction at all.</i><br>
But it does shape life to the laws of physics so the laws shape the physical<br>
structure of the organisms. There are organisms we could never possibly<br>
grasp how they existed until we ran into them face to face. This I believe<br>
will be true of any life we discover out in space because the humanoid shape<br>
is a direct molded evolution of tree swinging primates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If 'nature' could be personified, since 'she' does not care about effect,</i><br>
<i>&gt;'her' approach to engineering and it's environmental effects seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;remarkable similar to that of humankind in many ways: do something and see</i><br>
<i>&gt;what happens, it'll sort itself out in to a balance point after a while.</i><br>
Yeah but nature knows everything already, we must learn everything first.<br>
