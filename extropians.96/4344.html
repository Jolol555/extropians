&lt;&lt;    However, I reject this view of a person's desire for privacy. I<br>
strongly<br>
 believe that a deep concern for privacy is psychologically unhealthy. To the<br>
 extent that someone has this need, they are to that extent psychologically<br>
 crippled and certainly less estimable in my judgement than someone who has<br>
no<br>
 need for personal privacy. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree. Compulsively private people can complicate their lives to madness.<br>
<p>
Here I think we are having a semantics problem.<br>
<p>
Privacy in the term you are using it, is as loaded as Ayn Rand's use of the<br>
word selfish was when she started calling it a virtue. It has baggage.<br>
It is not exactly privacy in the sense that many of us think about that you<br>
oppose (an unhealthy compulsion to hide)  just as her "valued" kind of<br>
selfishness is not the usual meaning - (unthinking self obsession).<br>
<p>
  It seems you are talking about decompartmentalization, and issues of the<br>
"private self" as oposed to the "public self" . Plato thought  a good ruler's<br>
public self and private self  should be equal. A  man should be as good a<br>
person privately as publicly and so forth. Then he would be a truly great<br>
king.<br>
<p>
I agree with the premise that one should strive to be as integrated as<br>
possible, and show_ONE face_ to the world and not be ashamed of one's actions<br>
on any front! , <br>
But that is quite another thing from removing sovereignity over one's own<br>
_environment_, which may include alone time, secret value, not unveiling<br>
things until the right time, body privacy, and voluntary isolation.<br>
... if nothing else these things give one simplicity and peace. They may also<br>
be useful for strategical planning.<br>
