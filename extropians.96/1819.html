There are no new ideas I'm aware of for the decrease in frog population.<br>
 Ozone depletion, leading to increased ultraviolet radiation, is a popular<br>
theory, but some of the heaviest losses have been in tropical frog<br>
populations, where there has been as yet essentially no change in ozone or UV<br>
(it's still a polar phenomena).  The only worldwide change I'm aware of is<br>
the increase in CO2, and I've heard no hypotheses for this killing off frogs<br>
(you could cook up one with PH, perhaps).<br>
<p>
The deformed frog issue has to be approached with skepticism, as we don't yet<br>
know how many frogs were deformed before we started looking.  Minnesota is a<br>
big state with a lot of frogs, and there would be a lot of deformed frogs<br>
there under any circumstances.<br>
