Physical Improvements of Humans<br>
<p>
By Anders Sandberg<br>
<p>
Based on the discussions on rec.arts.sf.science, August 1996. I have stolen<br>
ideas and some sentences from the participants, which I hereby acknowledge.<br>
<p>
This page is devoted to modifications of the human body that are mainly<br>
surgical, chemical and genetic; bionics and genetic engineering have their<br>
own pages.<br>
<p>
Many of these ideas are general improvements of bugs or atavisms in our<br>
body, while some are outright changes. While some are likely to be popular<br>
among all humans (like production of vitamin C and improved organ<br>
suspension) others (like becoming amphibious or furry) will probably be used<br>
by only some people.<br>
<p>
<p>
Skeleton<br>
<p>
There are many possibilities for strengthening the skeleton, but it is<br>
important to keep the lightness and avoid making it too brittle (metals are<br>
too heavy). One idea is to use buckytubes or diamond composites instead of<br>
calcium phosphate crystals as the hard component of the bones.<br>
<p>
Arms and Hands<br>
<p>
Hands are definitely the area (beside the brain) where people have the most<br>
ideas.<br>
<p>
Generally, many would like to extend their capabilities with extra opposable<br>
fingers. At the same time, while the thumb is strong and dextrous, it is<br>
rather slow and not suitable for fine manipulation. Having fingers of<br>
different sizes is useful, and many would like to have longer fingers.<br>
<p>
The formation of the fingers are due to a gradient of morphogens, which<br>
induces the different changes. By influencing it, we can get more fingers<br>
and quite possibly two thumbs. It seems likely that the shape, number of<br>
joints and strength of the fingers can be changed this way.<br>
<p>
Adding more fingers might decrease motoric and sensory acuity if the cortex<br>
is not extended, but the brain is believed to have quite a bit of reserve<br>
capacity in this area.<br>
<p>
Adding two extra arms is a popular idea, although this would require some<br>
rather complex bone restructuring in the torso to attach them. A more<br>
radical idea would be two tentacles (octopus-style) extending at the<br>
shoulders (this would add a new way to manipulate objects)<br>
<p>
The medial nerve and the tendons for the thumb go through the carpal tunnel,<br>
which is clearly limiting and often gets into trouble. They should be<br>
diverted.<br>
<p>
Legs<br>
<p>
Many people complain that the knees are easily damaged; they are actually<br>
quite optimal, but might profit from a few more ligaments.<br>
<p>
The feet can be redesigned to prehensile feet, although that would limit our<br>
ability to walk long distances or run very fast in exchange for increased<br>
dexterity.<br>
<p>
One radical possibility would be to add an extra pair of legs. This is<br>
complex, but one idea is to add an extra hinge point to the torso so that<br>
the arms and head could be raised (much like a centaur); we could walk on<br>
all fours while using our hands normally. This could be combined with<br>
widening the pelvic arc, and perhaps with making the first pair of feet<br>
prehensible (the arms are used for dextrous manipulation, the forefeet for<br>
manipulation requiring strength).<br>
<p>
Altering the proportions of fast-twitch, slow-twitch muscle fibers might be<br>
desirable for some people; muscle cells do not divide, but can<br>
enlarge/shrink depending on use. It might be desirable to add the option of<br>
some regrowth, especially to deal with accidents and wounds.<br>
<p>
Torso<br>
<p>
The main problem with the torso is the spine - it is easily overloaded and<br>
damaged. One possibility would be to add a few short ribs to the lower back<br>
to attach tendons, improving overall strength and resilency, but decreasing<br>
the twisting ability. It is probably likely that it could be modified in<br>
other ways to work well with our new ecological niche as seat-dwellers (this<br>
could be combined with modifications of gluteus maximus).<br>
<p>
One idea is to suspend internal organs from the skeletal system, perhaps<br>
using tendons, instead of letting them lie on diaphragm. This would prevent<br>
many forms of hernia.<br>
<p>
Gastro-Intestinal Tract<br>
<p>
The symbiotic intestinal flora might be improved or made "smarter", for<br>
example by adding genetically designed versions (overall, our entire<br>
microflora could be improved, for example to produce clean or pleasant<br>
smells).<br>
<p>
One possibility would be to modify the urinary system to output its waste<br>
into the GIT, but caution has to be taken to limit the risk of infection.<br>
<p>
Circulatory System<br>
<p>
Since we are bipedal, our circulatory system has to work much harder to pump<br>
blood vertically. It might be a good idea to add an extra heart or several<br>
"helper hearts", perhaps based on the peristaltic hearts of insects, along<br>
the aorta or in the legs.<br>
<p>
Adrenaline thickens the blood, it becomes more likely to clot; very sensible<br>
in a natural environment, but downright deadly in a stressful modern city.<br>
Unlinking the fibrinogenic system from adrenaline control would definitely<br>
lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease.<br>
<p>
Breathing<br>
<p>
The human breathing system has some drawbacks, primarily the risk of choking<br>
on food. Ideally breathing/speaking would be done through another orfice, or<br>
at least there would be a spare opening that could be used in desperate<br>
situations or for integration with scuba gear and similar technological<br>
add-ons.<br>
<p>
Most air in the lungs is rather stale and is not vented with each normal<br>
breath, but this is a minor problem since the primary purpose of the lungs<br>
is to went carbon dioxide instead of absorbing oxygen (which is very<br>
plentiful). A uniflow system would be much smaller, but would loose heat and<br>
water faster than our current countercurrent system.<br>
<p>
Aquatic breathing is a classic idea. Making human amphibious or wholly<br>
aquatic is more complex than modifying the breathing system, it would be a<br>
good idea to add a thicker warming layer of fat beneath the skin, make the<br>
arms and legs more suitable for swimming, fill the ears with water to enable<br>
underwater hearing and modify the eyes (for example by adding clear<br>
nicticating membranes).<br>
<p>
One possibility would be reserve air storage, for example by improved red<br>
blood cells and myoglobin. But the main problem is getting rid of carbon<br>
dioxide.<br>
<p>
Reproduction/Sex<br>
<p>
Built-in contraceptives are a quite popular idea; some might be interested<br>
in removing menstruation, PMS and menopause entirely. Ideally, ovulation<br>
(and ejaculation) would be under voluntary control.<br>
<p>
The female pelvic girdle is a bottleneck, both due to our large heads (see<br>
the head section for some ideas) and our upright stance. It is surprisingly<br>
flexible, but might still be improved judging from the number of cesarian<br>
sections and deaths at birth in general. A radical solution would be to use<br>
a pouch instead, like kangaroos. This would allow the head to grow without<br>
any traumas, and allow men to bear children too (assuming the embryo grows<br>
inside the mother, then leaves and climbs into the pouch of the father or<br>
mother). Some psychologists have suggested that this would reduce birth<br>
trauma a lot and enhance mother(father)-child bonding.<br>
<p>
Some people might like genital taste buds and other improvements in<br>
innervation. Since the taste cortex is very close to the primary sensory<br>
cortex of the tounge, it appears likely that genital taste buds could be<br>
implemented and linked to suitable cortical regions by piggy-backing on the<br>
normal sensory pathways (most likely the taste sensations will be different<br>
from oral taste). Erogenous zones are apparently partially culturally<br>
dependent and often individual, but it appears likely that there are some<br>
neural pathways that could be added to create new erogenous zones (or remove<br>
them).<br>
<p>
Some find it unaesthetic to place the urinary tract in or close to the<br>
sexual organ, and would like another solution (like emitting urine into the<br>
lower intestine)<br>
<p>
Metabolism<br>
<p>
We are adapted to a diet of a projectile-predator on the East African<br>
savannah, not to living in a techno-agricultural niche. Our metabolism can<br>
definitely be modified to fit our current lifestyle better, and avoid many<br>
common problems (such as cholesterol plaques; predators manage this nicely,<br>
but as omnivores we have problems with excessive intake).<br>
<p>
Make weight and metabolic setpoints more easily changed; some peoples have<br>
problems in storing surplus food, so that the are more susceptible to<br>
malnutrition, while others tend to store too much fat and develop diabetes<br>
and heart disease.<br>
<p>
Humans are among the few mammals that cannot manufacture vitamin C. Adding<br>
this capability would appear very simple, and it might have useful effects<br>
as an antioxidant and immune-enhancer.<br>
<p>
Skin<br>
<p>
Pigment levels should ideally be easier to control, so that it would become<br>
darker to avoid sunburn before it occurs.<br>
<p>
The amount of hair that appears is apparently genetically determined<br>
(although beard growth is positively correlated to testosterone levels). It<br>
might be desirable to find ways to increase/decrease the amount of hair. Fur<br>
is a distinct possibility, together with adding patterns to it (this might<br>
be done to the skin too, creating "tigers" or "leopards").<br>
<p>
An increase in sensitivity in some areas is probably desirable, and quite<br>
probably pleasurable.<br>
<p>
Head<br>
<p>
The human head is a evolutionary bottleneck; making it any bigger would<br>
complicate birth enormously, and probably incur a greater chance of brain<br>
damage. One possibility would be to influence bone and brain growth so that<br>
more development can occur outside of the mother's body. There are still<br>
some limits to the size of the head, especially since it has to balance on<br>
the spinal column and the neck muscles.<br>
<p>
The skull is a good protection for the brain, but maybe not optimal.<br>
Especially intracranial hemmorages are very dangerous, hard to detect in<br>
time and mostly due to badly arranged blood vessels. Ideally the numerous<br>
small and easily damaged veins between the skull and brain should be made<br>
more flexible, removed or replaced with reinforced larger veins.<br>
<p>
Update the sinuses to belong on an upright biped - our noses tend to clog<br>
instead of drain.<br>
<p>
Human teeth are problematic, due to our long lifespans and our tendency to<br>
eat food that are bad for them. Inducing the growth of several sets of teeth<br>
instead of just the milk- and adult-teeth seems to be a good idea (unless<br>
one want to replace them with wholly artificial systems a la Jaws or use<br>
resilient ceramics).<br>
<p>
Remove the vomero-nasal organ (VNO) to become independent of pheromones.<br>
This will likely make a person less likely to become romantically involved<br>
with others or react strongly to the body odors of people, but might suit<br>
those who want to keep their emotions entirely under their own control.<br>
<p>
Eyes<br>
<p>
Adding ultraviolet vision is possible, since our receptors can detect it<br>
(partially by fluoroscence) but the lens absorbs it; by replacing the lens<br>
UV-vision becomes possible. Unfortunately this increases the risk for<br>
retinal damage, and there would be some problems with chromatic aberration<br>
(maybe we could develop a double lens system to fix this).<br>
<p>
Infrared sight is hard to do well, since the eye would only be able to see<br>
objects warmer than itself.<br>
<p>
One idea would be a pair of extra eyes specialized for UV or IR vision<br>
(perhaps like the heat-sensitive pits of certain snakes), and another would<br>
be to add nicticating membrances to limit the part of spectrum we look at.<br>
This could also be protective and useful for aquatic living.<br>
<p>
Brain and Nervous System<br>
<p>
Humans are easily addicted by pleasurable stimuli. It might be a good idea<br>
to add a taste-flip, so that a repeated stimuli after a while is not as<br>
pleasurable (this would have to work around the fact that most addictive<br>
drugs influence the mesolimbic dopamine system and nucleus accumbens; the<br>
mental interpretation of this would have to be possibly reversed by<br>
introducing habituating interneurons). This would be similar to how boredom<br>
makes repeated behaviors slightly unpleasant, keeping us active.<br>
<p>
The chemical senses of the brain are subtle, and are often able to detect<br>
quite well if some nutrients or chemicals are lacking in the body. These<br>
senses might be strengthened and made more conscious (as sometimes happens<br>
during pregnancy), which no doubt would improve healthy eating. In some<br>
diseases smell becomes more acute, which shows that it is possible to<br>
enhance senses in a biological way.<br>
<p>
In the same way, it might be desirable to be able to control the strength of<br>
sensory stimuli, to avoid being overwhelmed. This could involve the ability<br>
to "close one's ears" and suppress pain (pain is an important signal that<br>
something is wrong, but should not incapacitate us)-<br>
<p>
Sleep is important (probably to integrate memories during REM sleep and to<br>
let the immune system function well), but should be easier to control. Since<br>
it is possible to train oneself to become an "efficient sleeper", it is<br>
likely that it could be speeded up biologically. The ability to temporarily<br>
suppress sleep is desirable, although long-term effects are probably rather<br>
bad.<br>
<p>
The "fight-or-flight" stress response tends to "white-out" higher mental<br>
functions and replace them with instinctive reactions - very efficient in a<br>
dangerous natural setting, but less useful in a technological world where<br>
dangers seldom can be avoided by instinct. Ted Sturgeon suggested that the<br>
response would be rewired so that the higher functions become more active<br>
and speed up under serious stress. This would require some rather complex<br>
rewiring of the brainstem, but is probably feasible (for example, the<br>
noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus have a generally activating<br>
effect on the whole of the brain, and are linked to this response).<br>
<p>
There are many subtle errors in normal human cognition, which cause various<br>
problems in the modern world. For example, we tend to mix up implication<br>
with equivalence, judge risks in a very irrational manner (more people are<br>
afraid of flying than of driving) and make incorrect generalizations. If<br>
deductive/inductive reasoning could be instinctively learned during early<br>
maturation just like language, or these errors corrected, people would<br>
become less likely to fall into logical traps or irrationality.<br>
<p>
"Temporal Lobe Personality" is a term sometimes used to describe some<br>
people, who have increased activity in their temporal lobes: sexual drive is<br>
suppressed, paranoia, they tend to become almost monomaniac, extremely<br>
obsessed with details of the work and often have grand visions. Apparently<br>
both Dostoyevsky and van Gogh suffered from this condition. It would be<br>
useful if the more positive symptoms of TLP could be replicated and<br>
voluntarily controlled.<br>
<p>
Our bad memory is a common complaint. While long-term memory is very good,<br>
we are not as good at retrieving necessary information (this can be<br>
trained). And short-term memory can only handle 7+-2 chunks; if this could<br>
be extended we might become much better at handling several trains of<br>
thought at once.<br>
<p>
Immune System<br>
<p>
The immune system is excellent at fighting intruders and antigens, but tends<br>
to overreact, especially in places of high living standard where there are<br>
fewer dangers (the mast cells, which normally fight parasites seem to cause<br>
allergies when they are "out of work"). Ideally, its level should be more<br>
easily controllable, so that it could be kept at a safe level most of the<br>
time, and increased when shifting environment. This could be combined with<br>
the possibility of decreasing its attacks against certain antigens (but not<br>
all) to enable implants or some forms of surgery.<br>
<p>
Hormone System<br>
<p>
Our emotions are strongly influenced by hormone levels, which tend to swing<br>
out of control during adolescence or in some situations. It might be<br>
desirable to have conscious control of how much hormones are released, or to<br>
make the brain less susceptible to their influence.<br>
<p>
Decline in hormone levels due to aging should naturally be lessened; this is<br>
actually one possible origin of many aging signs and diseases.<br>
<p>
Aging and Development<br>
<p>
Slowing aging is high on almost everyone's wishlist.<br>
<p>
In our society, we would need a longer maturation time, ideally with no<br>
fixed end. One possibility is to make maturation and aging slow down more<br>
and more, so that everyone eventually reaches a steady state corresponding<br>
to the 20's (which are optimal in many ways).<br>
<p>
"Youthful idealism" might be partially hormonal, a way to make young males<br>
restless and leave the tribe to found new tribes. This apparently declines<br>
in most people as they age and become settled, but it might be possible to<br>
extend it (an idealism supplement?), which would probably be very healthy to<br>
do from time to time to prevent mental aging.<br>
