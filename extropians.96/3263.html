TANSTAAFL is the acronym for "There ain't no such thing as a free<br>
lunch." which was coined by Robert Heinlein in his novel _The_Moon_is _a<br>
_Harsh_Mistress_, and is the national motto of the Lunar Republic<br>
founded in the novel. it is also known by many engineers as a slang way<br>
of describing the Laws of Thermodynamics, Motion, and Energy. It is a<br>
favorite of Libertarians who are sci-fi fans, as it is also a great<br>
short description of the Libertarian Party Platform, which explains why<br>
so many Libertarians are Scientists and Engineers, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
For myself, the Lorrey Drive is a new propulsion technology which<br>
challenges peoples commonly held perceptions of these laws, but does not<br>
violate them one iota, in fact it relies on them to achieve its<br>
performance. For people who do not understand or cannot believe that it<br>
works, it is my way of adamantly saying "I am not a quack, and I'll<br>
prove it to you."<br>
<p>
Its funny, so many people in this world will easily believe that they<br>
they deserve a free lunch, but cannot believe that space travel is easy.<br>
