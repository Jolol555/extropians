A reminder of the party coming up in Woodside, California. If you attended<br>
the party at Freeland three years ago, you'll remember what an incredibly<br>
fun time we had. If not, you may have heard rumors...<br>
<p>
Here are the details and directions.<br>

Party Parameters<br>
<p>
Freeland, as many of you know, is a special, private place away from the<br>
paternalistic, invasive, and insane rules of governments. Instead, we have<br>
simple rules that are designed to maximize Individual Freedom, Happiness,<br>
and Fun!<br>
<p>
1. Tolerance: No one is to interfere with another=92s right to choose what=<br>
 to<br>
do with his/her own body and mind.<br>
2. Responsibility: Each is solely responsible for their actions.<br>
3. Respect for other=92s Property. Absolutely!<br>
4. No one is to initiate the use of force against another.<br>
5. Any disputes shall be resolved by the host and/or hostess.<br>
6. Each shall shower or rinse before entering the hot tub.<br>
7. Those unwilling or unable to be bound by these rules are not welcome to<br>
attend. Children, however, may attend provided a parent or guardian takes<br>
full responsiblity for their actions.<br>
