Regarding the cover-up conspiracies of a Navy missile shooting down<br>
TWA 800.  Is this relevant for the issue of government cover-ups?  Or is<br>
there something extropian I'm missing.  Being a Washingtonian, and<br>
knowing plenty of people in gov, I can tell you, they're just people.  And<br>
the military is just people too, with a somewhat lower mean IQ than the<br>
other gov departments.  The idea that people who work for the<br>
government *suddenly* have the ability and resources to cover-up the<br>
biggest secrets and fiascos is a fallacy of disempathy.  Do you think the<br>
gov is smarter than people at the New York Times or CNN?  Do you think<br>
all those involved in the investigation have the exact same ethical matrix?<br>
 And another thing that is inherent--no one can keep a secret long. <br>
Because a big secret is major leverage in a town based on influence.  It<br>
gets used for leverage over and over again, until it becomes tattered and<br>
exposed.  And the current people are well aware that a cover-up is<br>
more disastrous to political collateral than exposing the truth.  The big<br>
guys can always find a scapegoat to take the rap for a mess-up, but a<br>
real cover-up always leads to the top, they don't want that.  Do you<br>
really think Clinton would take the risk of being involved in the biggest<br>
cover-up of the decade during an election year, when the truth exposed<br>
would just result in the sacking of some navy brass?  Get logical here,<br>
please.  Remember, the X-files is just television, filmed in Vancouver B.C.<br>
