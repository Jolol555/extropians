<i>&gt; &gt;The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;physical matter. Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;information (as opposed to copying) is a fundamental limitation of all </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;information systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We can still live in a virtual world though with the laws of physics</i><br>
<i>&gt; altered at our whims and AI civilizations created and destroyed for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; entertainment. (Oh no! Here comes the AI civil liberties organization!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this scenario we do have the choice of either being a brain in a jar</i><br>
<i>&gt; with i/o streams feeding into a PC or we can augment our existing body</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyway we can think of and have a brain-PC interface builtin to our</i><br>
<i>&gt; genome such as communication with a PC via bat radar signals or tendrils on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the back of the neck which are a direct link to our brain. If this is true,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it doesn't matter much to me because I'd be satisfied with the 'greek god'</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea because I could still create entire universes in a virtual world as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well as have access to the continuously growing pool of human intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; plus gain immortality. Can silicon actually support life? If this is true</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we are required to 'move' data then Strong AI will never come about or</i><br>
<i>&gt; live in a quasi-consciousness where it continually lives/dies/lives/dies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; John, I'm looking for a reply on this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Being able to "jack in" to cyberspace is only marginally useful if <br>
you don't have the processing power to go with it.  Sure, you may <br>
have access to vast quantities of information, but if you are still <br>
processing it or thinking about it at tissue speeds then you aren't <br>
much better off.  It would amount to really nice visualization <br>
hardware/software.  You might be able to compensate by having AIs <br>
preprocess the information, essentially offloading some of the <br>
mundane thinking required, though.<br>
     It might be possible for Strong AI to develop, but I don't think <br>
it would likely develop spontaneously on a dynamic network.  Part of this <br>
might just be a limitation in our thinking.  It is hard to build a <br>
stable information architecture or operating software on a system <br>
where your resource structure and capabilities is constantly <br>
changing.  Unfortunately, this is pretty much what the Internet looks <br>
like.  Sure, it is possible to build a distributed system where the <br>
software is running in pieces concurrently among a number of systems. <br>
You even get some level of fault tolerance this way.  But when <br>
building any type of really sophisticated distributed system, you <br>
usually have a very concrete idea of the structure and capabilities <br>
of the overall system.  As I said, it is probably possible for a <br>
Strong AI to develop on a dynamic network, but it is both beyond our <br>
capabilities to model this type of system and quite possibly beyond <br>
the capabilities of the operating systems currently running on the <br>
much of the network to coordinate in this fashion.  Bandwidth and <br>
latency is also an issue.  A distributed intelligence would require <br>
some level of synchronization between its distributed components to <br>
operate in any type of coherent fashion.  <br>
Imagine if our neurons had to communicate with each other via UUCP!<br>
The activity of a distributed network AI would probably look <br>
something like an ant colony.  Individual components are kind of <br>
stupid, but the components as a whole show considerable <br>
intelligence and direction.<br>
     I think a more likely scenario would be an AI being developed on <br>
a structured secure network, and expanding into the internet from <br>
that point.  This would give the AI a secure static base from which <br>
to coordinate its consciousness.  It would also give its core entity <br>
a much higher level of data and process integrity.<br>
<p>
     The problem with the human brain is that we are more or less <br>
locked into the architecture that biology gave us.  Even if we <br>
replaced every neuron with optical switches, we would still be <br>
limited by the architecture.  It would be like running a '286 <br>
computer at 500MHz.  Fast, but very limited. <br>
