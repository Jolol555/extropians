I hope the following is more interesting that my previous<br>
school-marm-grammarian post to this thread. :)<br>
<p>
I originally posted this notion on rec.arts.sf.science a while back, and now<br>
wonder if anyone here would care to play?<br>
<p>
Here's my original post, and a follow-up to someone's reply:<br>
<p>
-----------------------------<br>
Subject: <br>
            The Very Fast Evolution Machine <br>
<p>
(...which is a nod to Ian Watson's wonderful short story title, `The Very<br>
Slow Time Machine'...)<br>
<p>
Frank J. Tipler developed the nice idea (in THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY and<br>
earlier in his co-authored THE ANTHROPIC COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE) that an<br>
effective AI deity might [even must] emerge in the final nanoseconds of the<br>
Big Crunch.  I like this notion a lot (having ventured close to it in my<br>
novel THE JUDAS MANDALA) and I've been wondering for some years if the<br>
obverse might also be plausible.<br>
<p>
In the earliest femtoseconds or whatever of the Big Bang eruption, with time<br>
effectively multiplied to infinite speeds but slowing fast - that is, vast<br>
numbers of exchanges occurring almost instantly in a densely compacted<br>
and connected spacetime where all the forces only `slowly' decoupled - might<br>
not there be effectively time enough for a superintelligence to evolve from<br>
scratch?  Even a whole batch of them, but perhaps they would inevitably<br>
remain merged until the cosmos was big enough for light-transmission delays<br>
to disrupt module communication...  Rather Gnostic, put that way.  Demiurges<br>
tumbling from the furnace of the Big Bang, cast out into the freezing dark.<br>
Perhaps placing their impress upon the new regimes of matter and light.  Yes,<br>
*now* there is a god... but that was then.  What of now?  Would such Blishian<br>
angels still have any impact on the universe?  More to the point, is their<br>
evolution, as sketched, remotely possible given current physics? <br>
<p>

I responded:<br>

Not all that similar, I think, although I see what you mean.  And of course<br>
Blish's THE TRIUMPH OF TIME does it with a sort of baby universe shaped by<br>
Amalfi's ontological codes. And Stephen Baxter's sequence starting with<br>
TIMELIKE INFINITY also has a battle for the shape of the universal substrate,<br>
as does his THE TIME SHIPS (the sequel to H. G. Wells's THE TIME MACHINE).<br>
None of these,<br>
I think, contains my key postulate: that just as the Tipler Eschaton has an<br>
effectively infinite number of discrete clock ticks within which a `god' may<br>
Do All Things, so too does the initial Hawking-smeared 10^-43 secs.  The<br>
question is: could anything structured emerge under such appallingly volatile<br>
conditions, however many virtual steps or epochs it contains?  It's one thing<br>
to persist into the Big Crunch, using shear energy etc; presumably it's quite<br>
another for `life' to bootstrap into existence under the same conditions.<br>
*Or is it?*<br>
