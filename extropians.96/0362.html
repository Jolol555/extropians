          I my opinion Cheer Leader Anders missed out one of our most <br>
          serious vices in his list (posted on the &gt;H mailing list) <br>
          over the weakneses of the transhumanist movement: <br>
          Dilettantism.<br>
          <br>
          Robin Hanson has complained about this recently. There are <br>
          so many people who think they know something:they make very <br>
          strong claims -and in many cases they don't even have a <br>
          first degree in the subject!<br>
          <br>
          I realise that when it comes to fields that are not covered <br>
          by the academic curriculum, one has to relax one's standards <br>
          somewhat. But this does not mean that we should tolerate <br>
          ignorance or that we should lower our aims. To the contrary, <br>
          we should work towards the degree of discipline and <br>
          responsibility that characterise the top 20% of the academic <br>
          community. We certainly have a long way to go, but if we do <br>
          enough progress we can hope that the academic establishment <br>
          will take over when we have carried it through half way. <br>
          <br>
          People in other "movements", especially our opponents, are <br>
          often worse than we are. So what.<br>
          <br>
