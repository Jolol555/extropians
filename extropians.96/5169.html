<i>&gt; &gt; Essentially, you have one station at geosynch, that is say a hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; miles long, containing a main EM rail system, and an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accelerator/decellerator rail in parallel. On the opposite side of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; planet, you've got a ground station, with a similar EM setup.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The cars would, when reaching the geosynch station, be traveling at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same velocity as the station, from which they can either dump their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; load, accept a load, or be switched to the parallel system for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; changeover to an accelerator for transition to higher orbit or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interplanetary trajectory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My orbital mechanics is pretty rusty, but I think the cars would</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually have a significant velocity relative to the geosynch station</i><br>
<i>&gt; (having climbed all the way up from Earth), and similarly would need a</i><br>
<i>&gt; big kick on leaving the station so that they would drop out of geosync</i><br>
<i>&gt; orbit all the way down to a perigee of 1 earth radius.  This is quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; a big drop.  My very rough calculations came out with a value of about</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10,000 m/s for the velocity differential between the circular orbit and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the elliptical one at apogee.  Maybe that is tolerable with your EM rail,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it is long enough.  A similar velocity differential exists at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth side as well.  (Obviously you need greater than LEO speed there,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is about 7000 m/s.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Your numbers are wrong. The cars would be going at their very slowest at<br>
their highest altitude (read keplers law) and fastest at the ground. I<br>
am actually concerned that they wont be going fast enough at geosynch,<br>
as they need to be going slow enough to fall back to earth, rather than<br>
staying in geosynch, even though at apogee they will be tangential to<br>
the geosynch orbit. <br>
<p>
Opening my _Introduction to Space Dynamics_ by William Tyrrell Thomson,<br>
I see that my deduction is right. Essentially, the cars will be<br>
following a Hohmann transfer orbit, with lower orbit tangential point at<br>
earth ground (perigee) and upper point at Geosynch station, where the<br>
velocity of the cars would be less than the velocity of the station, so<br>
the station would catch up to the cars as they reach their peaks, add a<br>
little momentum to keep them, and then drop them off the back, regaining<br>
the momentum when they are returning a car. If you drop off a car every<br>
time you pick up a car, you lose or gain zero momentum at the station.<br>
Give me a little time and I'll give you some accurate velocity<br>
calculations. If your equations are right, I think that you just have<br>
apogee and perigee mixed up.<br>
