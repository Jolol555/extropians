<i>&gt; I was raised by a single female parent who held down a job as a college</i><br>
<i>&gt; professor teaching mathematics and computer science, and I have always</i><br>
<i>&gt; felt like I was totally untouched by the 'sexism' meme. Then one day I</i><br>
<i>&gt; read something called 'A Person Paper on Purity in Language' by William</i><br>
<i>&gt; Satire (alias Douglas R. Hofstadter.) It made me aware of just how</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexually biased the very language I think in is (and it made me laugh at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same time!) I highly recommend it, but unfortunately don't have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; URL to point you to. It's chapter eight in a collection of Hofstadter's</i><br>
<i>&gt; essays called Metamagical Themas.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's a marvellous paper; it was one of the reasons I have<br>
investigated other Sapir-Whorf effects, studied Lojban, and on a<br>
smaller scale, used neutral pronouns in the Oceania Constitution<br>
(the ey/eir set).<br>
<p>
Is anyone on this list able to contact Mr. Hofstaedter?  If he<br>
would grant permission, I would gladly place the paper on my site.<br>
