Very interesting.  In a sense the language would be somewhat fractal in<br>
nature.  I wonder how you would encode something like this?  I suppose a<br>
simple version could be done using something like hypertext.  You click on a<br>
concept to resolve a particular concept in finer detail, or maybe have a<br>
more global resolution mapping.  The plus of this type of heirarchical<br>
language structure is that indexing could be very precise, much more precise<br>
than current single-level linear documents.<br>
<p>
Actually, (I am writing this as I am thinking) it might be very nicely<br>
encoded in a type of object-oriented paradigm, similar to object-oriented<br>
programming tools.  You could generate (and encode) new concepts and words<br>
as extended instances of a base class.  This would force structure upon the<br>
language without really putting any constraints on it.  It would probably<br>
also make language processing and comprehension software much easier to<br>
write and model, since it would eliminate ambiguities.<br>
<p>
Using an object-oriented paradigm, you could control resolution by selecting<br>
which level of object (concept) inheritance you choose to view.  A person<br>
who doesn't want to know the most intimate details of a concept could choose<br>
to view the more generalized base class of that object, and so on.  You<br>
could, theoretically, encode the entirety of human knowledge by subclassing<br>
a single base class a very large number of levels.  This type of language<br>
encoding would be well suited for computer implementation.<br>
<p>
I would be willing to discuss this in great detail with an eye toward<br>
implementation, now that my interest and intellect has been piqued.<br>
