<i>&gt;A world which can fabricate uploads will look drastically different than </i><br>
<i>&gt;our current one. I'd consider the delta to be at least as large as </i><br>
<i>&gt;between a neolithical village, and modern Manhattan. Should future things </i><br>
<i>&gt;even slightly follow predicted dynamics, we will see some wildly </i><br>
<i>&gt;improbable things happening. Few days ago, I've picked up a nice SciFi </i><br>
<i>&gt;novel. It is called "Particle Physics and Astrophysics", and it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;quite outdated, since published in 1989. If you are tracking IT progress, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and remember how leisurly things used to happen back then, in 1983, or </i><br>
<i>&gt;so, the dynamics of end-1996, at least for me, are at times frightening </i><br>
<i>&gt;(also, quite depressing, but that is another story). But we ain't seen </i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing yet! How's that for frightening?</i><br>
<p>
Explain further. I'm also unfamiliar with what IT means.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; Yeah but if you don't augment yourself fast enough you'll be left behind</i><br>
<i>&gt; and archaic and eventually become incompatable with the operating system</i><br>
<i>&gt; and die. Also uploaded beings with more power and processing speed will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to augment faster than you and be many times more creative and</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent than you and thus discover anything new in any material you</i><br>
<i>&gt; could possibly have access to before you get there and thus never be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to climb the tree.&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
And you don't think that people won't be greedy for processing power?<br>
Processing power will be the new currency. See can't get rid of Capitalism!<br>
You can't beat spontaneous orders and evolution! They ARE life and WE are<br>
THEM.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;At that point you would be confined to engaging in activities the poor of</i><br>
<i>&gt;today cannot.  I'm talking about the wonderful virtual realities envisioned</i><br>
<i>&gt;for uploads.  The capital required to maintain such worlds for slow AIs would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be a fraction of the GNP of the upload community.  You could think of it as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;brighter version of today's welfare money (insignificant really) being spent</i><br>
<i>&gt;on drugs (what those who have nothing meaningful to offer do).</i><br>
<p>
It would be just as computers are on the net today. People with slow net<br>
access won't have access to richer information because the multimedia bogs<br>
down their connections so their perception of time will just get slower and<br>
slower while people with more processing power will just get faster and<br>
faster. In an uploaded realm, the only method is blanket socialism which<br>
must be programmed in before we enter the uploaded realm. It's a different<br>
world. Capitalism will destroy the system. Also socialism could work in an<br>
uploaded realm and you could have intelligent agents designing and creating<br>
newer better faster processors and increasing the processing speed and<br>
being the engineer side while we kick back and relax and be the artistic<br>
creative side.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The trend was started when organisms began communicating.  It has become more</i><br>
<i>&gt;pronounced with the development of cellular technology.  Many religions dream</i><br>
<i>&gt;about it (become one with God/Heaven/Universe sort of thing).  This rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt;communication is why I support the view that Tipler's Omega Point will be one</i><br>
<i>&gt;entity.</i><br>
<p>
I can agree to being one brain cell in a brain composed of many but not all<br>
brain cell/people being merged into one cell.<br>
<p>
"You cannot discover new oceans, unless you have the courage<br>
 to lose sight of the shore"<br>
