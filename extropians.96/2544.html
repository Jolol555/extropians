Democracy is generally seen as the ideal political system by most of <br>
the western world, but does it make evolutionary sense ?  <br>
<p>
Democracy says that all parts of this complex organism <br>
called society have a say in how it grows.  That is to say that a <br>
plumber, a mathematician, a poet and a politician all have the same <br>
ability in judging what is best for the whole of society.  <br>
Specialization of this skill makes a whole lot more sense to me.  <br>
As an analogy one can see in the human organism, that it is our brains <br>
which "decide" where we are heading in our evolutionary jungle, <br>
although it depends on the correct functioning of the other organs, <br>
they do not participate in the decision process.<br>
<p>
The ideal situation for maximum growth would be to have people who <br>
know what the best evolutionary paths are, in power.  Democracy's <br>
answer to the question of "how do we decide who knows best ?" is <br>
simply to say that it'll take the average of all human decisions <br>
(including the bad ones).  <br>
To me, it makes more sense to have a dictator in power.  The method <br>
of his ascension will not be voting, but rather becoming a leader <br>
because of his success in the free market.<br>
<p>
Leaders will autoevolve in a free market system, without the <br>
artificial intervention of democracy.<br>
