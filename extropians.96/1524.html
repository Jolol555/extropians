Robin Hanson asks ( re: a system  of the more knowledgable among us flagging<br>
(or rating)  posts for content)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What is the difference between this and a moderated "best &gt;of" list?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't see how it is any less objectionable on elitism grounds.</i><br>
  <br>
    Ahh, but i am not making an assertation about elitism at all.<br>
I am not against an elite, if one exists then so be it . Rather I am  not<br>
amenable to having my choices made for me. And i would certainly not be<br>
interested in being on any kind of jury.<br>
    <br>
I suggested a guide system, probably not a very practical idea, in<br>
application,  but it was meant as a constructive alternative to censoring the<br>
list. <br>
<p>
    Two lists would take MORE of my time, not less...<br>
<p>
    I'm not against your idea, Ijust don't want to be on the list(s) if it<br>
goes that way. It was a closed list before and it can be again. It's a<br>
perfectly valid idea, in light of the problem of quality. Perhaps it is<br>
neccessary, and if two lists- one lesser one greater- seems like the<br>
solution, go for it!   I have lovely things planned for the free time I will<br>
have.....study, beach, jacuzzis, cafes, dancing...<br>
<p>
No doubt someone would forward me the really good items .<br>
