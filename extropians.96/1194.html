This sets the little cogwheels in my head in motion... What about the<br>
means of producing the means of production? A nanoassembler can build an<br>
identical nanoassembler, just as a robot factory could build another, but<br>
they would be qualitatively similar. Building a better or different<br>
assembler (for use in space, the bloodstream or in the atmosphere of<br>
Jupiter, or based on silicon instead of carbon) would require some work<br>
and expertise. <br>
<p>
If assemblers are general enough to produce just about everything needed <br>
in a certain environment (like the exotic surface of the Earth) new <br>
assemblers isn't needed (but then again, why do we write new compilers <br>
and computer languages all the time when they are all essentially <br>
equivalent?). But up until that point the means of producing new means of <br>
production are very important; my guess is that they will supercede the <br>
means of production in importance quite soon after nanotechnology becomes <br>
really useful, up until the point where it can do everything everyone <br>
wants. <br>
<p>
One could look at even higher levels of "means of producing the means <br>
of...", but what we are essentially seeing here is a level of <br>
metaengineering, where the goal is to develop better ways to reach goals. <br>
Quite similar and synergetic to self-augmentation, which is the same <br>
process applied to intelligent systems. <br>
