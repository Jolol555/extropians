<i>&gt; Actually, the difficulty isn't so much in the hardware as it is in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; to consider the relationships between signals on the order of millions or</i><br>
<i>&gt; billions of simultaneous signals.  This has to be done both going in to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware and going back in to the brain.  The computational complexity of</i><br>
<i>&gt; decoding this type of interface would require immense quantities of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You could use neural network based enhancement hardware to minimize the</i><br>
<i>&gt; interfacing problem, but neural networks are not efficient computational</i><br>
<i>&gt; architectures for many classes of problems.  In the long run, it would break</i><br>
<i>&gt; down to how much you are willing to spend for computational enhancement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The cost/performance ratio could get prohibitively large very fast, based</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost exclusively on the complexity of installation and integration.</i><br>

Yes, scanning every last connection and impulse is not neccessary. Using<br>
algorithms describing the neural behavior to build identical system that<br>
operates at various speeds (accelerate as the user gets used to the new<br>
hardware) and can be hooked up to the brain would I believe be all that<br>
is needed, plus time. Given a hookup to unused capacity, it is the<br>
natural tendency to occupy the space. There are very few parts of the<br>
human brain that cannot be damaged and rerouted around, and those tend<br>
to be the visual and spinal areas, areas which will be the first to be<br>
augmented. Once the human has shifted enough of their capacity to new<br>
hardware, cutting the cord would have no discernable effects. Given new<br>
capacity, the mind will grow as a natural consequence.<br>
<p>
Yes some types of computation are difficult with neural systems,<br>
however, with the new hardware, it will be much easier for the<br>
individual to engage in rapid interface with auzilliary systems that can<br>
do the work. Like having a calculator hooked up to your mind, rather<br>
than having to punch out all the buttons...<br>
