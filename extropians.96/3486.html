Whoops!  Ah, thanks, but no thanks.<br>
I discussed all that in my Singularity page.<br>
<a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html</a><br>
<p>
I am not asking for a discussion of the issues listed.<br>
I am asking for help building a form letter.<br>
<p>
Let's just say that I'm familiar with everything you said, and - don't<br>
take this the wrong way - so, most likely, is everyone else on the<br>
list.  The question now is how to package our memes in a short,<br>
attractive, direct and easily understandable outline, with individual<br>
paragraphs being left to individual Extropians who write articles and<br>
whatnot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The term "Singularity" was invented by Vernor Vinge in his novel,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Marooned in Realtime".  It did have basically the same meaning you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; applying, a case of runaway intelligence amplification.  Interestingly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the novel it was largely a matter of the creation of a group mind, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; people able to interact directly at the mental level.  This is somewhat</i><br>
<i>&gt; different from typical Extropian ideas, which are more individualistic in</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature and would picture augmented individuals rather than groups.</i><br>
<p>
None of the issues you raised would be appropriate for an introduction,<br>
being sophisticated objections and counter-objections that presuppose an<br>
understanding of the material we are trying to introduce.  Book<br>
citations are not to be used unless necessary.  Multiple paths to the<br>
Singularity should be used only when each new Path adds necessary<br>
information.<br>
<p>
Your statement about the invention of the Singularity occurring in that<br>
novel may be incorrect; my first encounter with it was in Vinge's<br>
postscript to the story "Run, Bookworm, Run!"  We are not to mention the<br>
word "Extropian" unless necessary; we are packaging the idea of the<br>
Singularity, not the cult phenomenon.  Individualism is not a necessary<br>
cognitive prerequisite to understanding the Singularity.  Leave it out. <br>
Group minds are intriguing but not necessary to an understanding of the<br>
Singularity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While the 2025 date may be effective for dramatic impact, I think there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a lot of uncertainty over how quickly the various changes you predict</i><br>
<i>&gt; will actually occur.</i><br>
<p>
Before the turn of the century, quite possibly, and I said so both in my<br>
original article and in my Web page.<br>
<p>
I'll not respond to the rest, because again, you may have missed the<br>
point.<br>
<p>
I hold that the following ideas are necessary in an introduction and<br>
initial presentation of the Singularity meme:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.</i><br>
	The easiest argument to understand.  Attention-catcher.<br>
<i>&gt; 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.</i><br>
	Another easy argument.  Both give the flavor of the Singularity.<br>
<i>&gt; 3.  Defines "Singularity."</i><br>
	Having a snappy name and a simple definition is a memetic advantage.<br>
<i>&gt; 4.  Is this a good thing?  Names factions.</i><br>
	First thing that occurs to everyone:  Will it affect me?<br>
<i>&gt; 5.  Doomsday faction.</i><br>
	Seems to be the instinctive reaction; could be true.<br>
	Catches reader's attention through a possible threat.<br>
<i>&gt; 6.  Uploading faction.</i><br>
	Defusing the instinct; making the Singularity attractive.<br>
	We don't want federal bans on nanotech.<br>
<i>&gt; 7.  Intro to nanotechnology.</i><br>
	Nanotechnology may be the best way of conveying the upheavals brought<br>
	about by the Singularity.  We can't simply say that the Singularity<br>
will<br>
	erase human society; we have to show it.<br>
<i>&gt; 8.  Nearness of nanotechnology.</i><br>
	Short-term threats/goals get more attention.<br>
<i>&gt; 9.  Nanotechnology replaces economy.</i><br>
	SHOW that the Singularity will replace human society...<br>
<i>&gt; 10. Gray goo problem.</i><br>
	It's not all roses.  The reader has a right to know, and again the<br>
	threat of destroying the planet can grab the attention, although<br>
	not quite so much after all the false alarms.<br>
<i>&gt; 11. Intelligence amplification.</i><br>
	Part and parcel of the Singularity, but hard to convey.<br>
<i>&gt; 12. Runaway positive feedback of IA.</i><br>
	Ditto.<br>
<i>&gt; 13. Replacement of human society: End of History.</i><br>
	The Singularity is not one of your petty memes.<br>
<i>&gt; 14. Singularity provides Interim Meaning of Life.</i><br>
	Ditto.  One of the ways to hook a meme in the mind is by<br>
	making previously established memes dependent on it.<br>
<i>&gt; 15. Summary: History is about to end.</i><br>
	The meme as we want it to spread, once all symbolic groundwork<br>
	is laid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even where I disagree with the specifics about the timeline, I do think</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is a plausible "big picture" approach to human history and it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a good outline of issues that are worth thinking about.</i><br>
<p>
We are not giving a complete explanation!  We are not debating!<br>
We are creating and packaging a meme and our sole goal<br>
is that it infect a majority of the human race ASAP!<br>
<p>
Can I have some constructive criticism of the *outline*,<br>
repeat *the linear order in which the ideas are presented*,<br>
and some debate over the *modules*,<br>
repeat *which ideas have been chosen for inclusion*,<br>
and NOT NOT NOT the ideas themselves?<br>
