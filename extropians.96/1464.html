In response to my post on the Gradient Theorem, Dan Clemmensen <br>
says:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your argument is intended to cover both goods and information, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With respect to goods, your argument make the assumption that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the cost of transportation is negligable, or at least that the cost is </i><br>
<i>&gt; less than the difference in cost between the buyer's manufacturing cost </i><br>
<i>&gt; and the seller's manufacturing cost of the good the seller is attempting </i><br>
<i>&gt; to sell.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  <br>
<p>
Genie machines have, along with their many other nifty features, <br>
the ability to move things -- or to make trucks (or other devices) with <br>
which to move things.  Some people will find that they are better suited <br>
to this task than to anything else, and they will specialize in it.  They <br>
will use their genie machines to move things... in more mundane <br>
language, they will work for UPS.  The cost of transportation will be <br>
comparable to the cost of everything else in genie-land.  <br>
<p>
The cost of making somthing in a large-scale genie machine (a factory), <br>
putting it on a truck or train, and shipping it somewhere, will be less,    <br>
in many cases, than the cost of reprogramming a genie machine to make <br>
the item at home.  Just like now.  <br>
<p>
The basic argument here is that you are trying to escape from the <br>
economic system, and I'm saying you can't.  You can make any <br>
assumption you want, consistent with physical reality, and I can show <br>
that even with that assumption, you will still be in an economy.  <br>
I will give you SI, I will give you software that replicates itself, <br>
I will give you diamondoid materials:  and given all that, you will <br>
still be in an economy.  There is no escape!   &lt;evil g&gt; <br>
