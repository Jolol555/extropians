I hear that they do sell the varieties containing LSD but they are treated<br>
with a toxic fungicide so you would need to grow a generation of morning<br>
glories to get fresh seeds which isn't hard. But I also hear that the side<br>
effects are worse than the 'high'. I hear that you can get VERY sick from<br>
them and that you need to mash the seeds into a pulp. I myself have never<br>
tried acid but I know alot about herbs and plants. When I was 5 I tookover<br>
the backyard and grew all sorts of plants but now I only grow Insectivorous<br>
plants (ie. flytraps, sundews, butterworts, etc) and I'm dying to get my<br>
hands on some nepenthes!<br>

<i>&gt;LSD was originally extracted by Dr. Hoffman from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;rye fungus ergot (claviceps purpurea) from which several </i><br>
<i>&gt;popular medications are derived, such as the life exten-</i><br>
<i>&gt;sion drug Hydergine. Here too, in the case of rye fungus, </i><br>
<i>&gt;there is evidence of ceremonial religious use when prop-</i><br>
<i>&gt;erly prepared, as the fungi is quite poisonous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hawaiian wood rose also contains LSD, as I understand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in fairly high concentrations. It's even sold through</i><br>
<i>&gt;mail order companies. I'm, however, not aware of it</i><br>
<i>&gt;being associated with historical ritual use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But in essence (with or without mushrooms) you are talking about something</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quite important, more specifically *patterns and visualizations* and a keen</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;observation about the intelligence of humans - being that (primarily) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; through the vision part of the brain, we have developed pattern </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recognitions that other species do not. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;How this will shape up in the debate about and developement of cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;science and intelligence research  I am not qualified to say. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But it is certain that our eyes and mind and imagination (mind's eye) all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;work together in a very different and cohesive way to make us what one </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would call "sentient".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IAN: It's interesting to note that the anti-drug mind-set, </i><br>
<i>&gt;which acts to suppress the logical integration of hallucinogenic</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge and practice into modern life and anthropo-neurological</i><br>
<i>&gt;investigation, cannot see the connections that make this line of </i><br>
<i>&gt;inquiry logical.  In short, the lower intellectual capacity of </i><br>
<i>&gt;this violent subset of society suppresses the application of </i><br>
<i>&gt;those agents that may be associated with the growth of intellect-</i><br>
<i>&gt;ual capacity, which is exactly what one would predict. The drug </i><br>
<i>&gt;laws represent the victory of ignorance which stifles further </i><br>
<i>&gt;intellectual progress and evolution along these lines.</i><br>
