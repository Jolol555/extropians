<i>&gt;&gt; He (together with Tom Morrow) coined the term 'Extropian', started the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Extropian movement, edits and publishes Extropy magazine, organizes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Extro conferences and is more active (through articles, debates &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interviews) in defining and promoting Extropianism than anyone else. Can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; anyone claim to be doing more ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[SNIP]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, no one can reasonably make that claim, by any stretch of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the imagination.  What I disagree with is Chris Hind's assumption</i><br>
<i>&gt;that Max is a "central authority".</i><br>
<p>
  It's misleading language, and<br>
<i>&gt;gives the distinct and incorrect impression that "where Max</i><br>
<i>&gt;leads, we shall follow".</i><br>
Well it's obvious this isn't a cult. Cults require irrational thought and<br>
mysticism. Yes each of us makes our own choice whether to accept the<br>
extropian ideas or not, just like I'm not keen on the idea of changing names<br>
which I think is a little hokey or sci-fi-ish.<br>
<p>
  I personally agree with almost everything<br>
<i>&gt;Max has to say, but only because I submit what he says first to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "central authority" between my ears, for my own evaluation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Max is one of the most consistently rational people I've ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;had the pleasure to deal with.  I dislike seeing him misrepresented,</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether by ignorance or guru worship.</i><br>
How is he misrepresented? He IS the authority in the way the media percieves<br>
us. And I think that everyone here in this mailinglist realizes that he<br>
isn't our "central authority".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another thing: alt.extropians is several years old.  If one is</i><br>
<i>&gt;going to do something with it, call it "resurrection" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;"resuscitation", rather than "ribbon cutting".</i><br>
I called it ribbon cutting as in calling it the *NEW* extropians newsgroup<br>
and yes I do know it's old. It's just like the reopening of a store after a<br>
remodel.<br>
