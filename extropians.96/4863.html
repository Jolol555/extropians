I think you can make fun of anything and I like jokes that are in bad taste, <br>
provided they're funny. I don't think Lyle Burkhead's post about The <br>
Holocaust was funny.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Obviously, if photos of the gassing operation existed, they                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;would have been published a long time ago. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
There are plenty of pictures of the gas chambers, but I grant you I don't <br>
know of any photos of the interior of the gas chambers when they were in <br>
operation.  Perhaps the NAZIS had noting better to do during the war than <br>
build gas chambers for fun, perhaps the many people who heard screams <br>
coming from them were mistaken, perhaps somebody told a joke in the chamber<br>
and they were really laughing, but perhaps there is another explanation why <br>
we don't have photos. The victims were all naked and could have not had a <br>
camera, and when the air tight doors of the gas chamber are sealed it is <br>
pitch dark, the only opening is a small hole to drop the Zyklon B crystals <br>
through. Yes, the guards could have rigged up a remote controlled camera and <br>
special flood lights,  but, well ... I can only speak for myself but I <br>
wouldn't go to all that trouble just to prove to the world that I was a mass <br>
murderer. Most murders don't like to leave more evidence around than they <br>
need to.<br>
<p>
If the gas chambers did not exist I don't see why somebody didn't use that in <br>
their defense in any of the many war crimes trials after the war. Instead the  <br>
defense was either "I was only following orders" or "I was never a guard at <br>
the camp, you have me confused with another man with the same name". Even  <br>
Rudolf Hoess, the commander of Auschwitz never denied he used gas chambers. <br>
Hoess testified at his trial:<br>
<p>
  "The Final Solution of the Jewish question mente the complete extermination  <br>
   of all Jews in Europe. I was ordered to establish extermination facilities  <br>
   at Auschwitz in June 1941."<br>
<p>
Hoess bragged that he ran the most efficient death factory in the Reich, and <br>
cheerfully described how Auschwitz routinely turned 6000 living human beings <br>
into a small dump truck full of ashes ever day. He then gave us his secrets <br>
for success, when he was told to set up his new camp he decided to do some <br>
research first.<br>
<p>
  "I visited Treblinka to find out how they carried out exterminations. The  <br>
   camp commander at Treblinka told me he used [carbon] monoxide gas and I <br>
   did not think his methods were very efficient. So when I set up the   <br>
   extermination building at Auschwitz I used Zyklon B which is crystallized  <br>
   prussic acid which we dropped into the death chamber from a small opening. <br>
   It took from three to fifteen minutes to kill the people in the death   <br>
   chamber, depending on climatic conditions. We knew when the people were   <br>
   dead because their screaming stopped.[...] Another improvement we made  <br>
   over Treblinka was that we built our gas chambers to accommodate 2000 <br>
   people at one time, whereas at Treblinka their ten gas chambers only <br>
   accommodate 200 people each [...] Still another improvement we made over<br>
   Treblinka was that at Treblinka the victims almost always knew they were <br>
   to be exterminated while at Auschwitz we endeavored to fool the victims <br>
   into thinking that they were to go through a delousing process. [...] We <br>
   were required to carry out these exterminations in secrecy, but of course <br>
   the foul and nauseating stench from continuously burning bodies permeated<br>
   the entire area and all the people living in the surrounding communities <br>
   knew that exterminations were going on at Auschwitz."<br>
<p>
Remember this was said by Rudolf Hoess, the top man at Auschwitz, there is no <br>
reason for him to say these things if they were not true, it would not be to <br>
his advantage. As it is, by telling the truth Hoess was hanged in 1947.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Fred Leuchter went to Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;took samples from the alleged gas chambers, and sent them                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt; to a lab to be tested for traces of toxic gas.                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The reason that cyanide, the gas given off by Zyklon B, is very popular in <br>
the termite killing business and very unpopular in the chemical warfare  <br>
business is that it leaves no residue, it does not last and in fact is <br>
lighter than air. Unless it's confined in a building it becomes harmless <br>
almost immediately.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;either there were gas chambers at Auschwitz, or there were                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;not.  We aren't talking about Schroedinger's cat.                      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No Lyle, I fear we are talking about Schroedinger's cat. I can't think of any <br>
evidence that would satisfy you, you say all the witnesses are lying, and  <br>
the millions who vanished are not dead but just shy and don't want to speak <br>
up, if I did have photos I'm sure you would say they were fake. We know the  <br>
gas chambers existed, we have lots of witnesses who say they saw them in  <br>
operation, we have crematoria and burning pits that could have deposed of the <br>
bodies, we have millions of missing Jews, it doesn't seem like much of a <br>
stretch to form a conclusion from the above. The evidence is excellent that<br>
millions were gassed but I wasn't there so can I be absolutely certain. The  <br>
evidence is excellent that ROME exists, but I've never been there so I can't <br>
be absolutely certain that the city exists either.<br>
<p>
Lyle, I think one reason you wrote your post is that you wanted to shock <br>
people, well it certainly worked in my case. I've strongly disagreed with you <br>
in the past but was astonished that you, or anyone on the Extropian List  <br>
would write anything so ugly.<br>
