David Musick and Richard Brodie have said that, if they found themselves<br>
in the shooting room, they would be willing to bet that the dice won't<br>
roll double sixes.  In fact David wants odds in his favor(!).<br>
<p>
I wonder if they and others will agree, though, that this is a losing<br>
strategy for most people who follow it.  Suppose that as we run the<br>
experiment, every person in the room turns to their neighbor and makes<br>
this bet.  One person in each pair bets that the dice will come up<br>
double sixes, while the other bets that they will not.  (We make sure<br>
there are an even number of people in the room each time.)<br>
<p>
At the end of the experiment, 90% of the people who bet that the dice<br>
will come up double sixes will have won, while only 10% who bet the way<br>
David and Richard advise will have won.  Their advice is a loser for 90%<br>
of the people who follow it.<br>
<p>
Does everyone agree on this?<br>
<p>
