On  Sat, 28 Sep 1996  Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt; CLAIMED I said:<br>
                    <br>
<i>                &gt;As John  Clark said, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Human judgment is not involved whenever one post needs</i><br>
<i>                &gt;to be written to reply to another, very dumb automatic</i><br>
<i>                &gt;process do it for us.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
That is NOT what I said! What I actually said was:<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Human judgment is not involved whenever one logic gate needs </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to be connected to another, very dumb automatic process do </i><br>
<i>                &gt;it for us,  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I don't think it's playing fair to deliberately misquote me just so you can <br>
better insult a fellow list member, it makes it sound like I agree with your <br>
childish name calling of Rich, and I most certainly do not.<br>
<p>
I also note that you attack Rich for not providing enough details as to why <br>
manufacturing with Nanotechnology is much  easier than conventional  <br>
manufacturing, yet when I try to provide some of those very details you say <br>
you want your only reply is:<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;This is very boring.  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I was hoping to get some intelligent feedback, I was hoping that if there <br>
were any errors in my logic you could help me find them, when somebody  <br>
corrects one of my errors I am in their dept. Instead of an informative post  <br>
from you I get the following:<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;John, if you uploaded yourself into better hardware, you                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;would just miss the point a hundred times faster.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Well, I guess that's a little better than "if brains were dynamite you  <br>
couldn't blow your nose", but not much. Apparently at some point in your life <br>
you have had an epiphany and The Truth was revealed to you, namely that <br>
Nanotechnology can not possibly work. Since you already know The Truth there  <br>
is no point in being confused by the dull facts. I think I need to change my <br>
debating tactics with you and close my copy of Science Magazine and get out <br>
Captain Eddy's book of 1001 insults.<br>
       <br>
