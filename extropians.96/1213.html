&lt;&lt; what do you put on your vita so readers of it can quickly assess the<br>
quality of the publication?   With an ordinary journal the journal itself<br>
signals quality.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
An ordinary journal signals quality (or lack of) by its history.  With time,<br>
this on-line publication system will be recognized as quality (or not).   I<br>
think the requirement of application to join is a safeguard.  Applications<br>
can be verified.  "Recognized" names of people doing the peer review might<br>
help if they join. <br>
<p>
The peer review I have been involved with is not as good as this proposal<br>
because the reviewers were chosen poorly.  They did not even know my subject.<br>
 And, I was chosen to review some far way areas which I sent to people who<br>
_did_ know the subject.  At least I notified the editor and got approval to<br>
do this.  Some people I sure have not.  Will this on-line system be any<br>
better?<br>
<p>
Currently anonymous reviewers are chosen.  Do you think this is good?  How do<br>
you know _their_ quality even in an ordinary journal?  I've seen terrible<br>
articles published in highly respected journals.  Without knowing the<br>
reviewers, I can say they must have been very poor or they passed the article<br>
off but to lesser qualified people.  The system we have now is the problem.<br>
 Anyone can "pass off" a review to another reviewer.  Will the on-line system<br>
prevent this with PGP signatures?<br>
<p>
The main reason I like peer review is: To make me think about what the<br>
reviewers have said.  Therefore, I improve my publication.  This works in<br>
many cases but I would like more views of my work.  I think the on-line<br>
system will do this better than what I have now.<br>
