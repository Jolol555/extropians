<i>&gt;          I realise that when it comes to fields that are not covered</i><br>
<i>&gt;          by the academic curriculum, one has to relax one's standards</i><br>
<i>&gt;          somewhat. But this does not mean that we should tolerate</i><br>
<i>&gt;          ignorance or that we should lower our aims. To the contrary,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          we should work towards the degree of discipline and</i><br>
<i>&gt;          responsibility that characterise the top 20% of the academic</i><br>
<i>&gt;          community. We certainly have a long way to go, but if we do</i><br>
<i>&gt;          enough progress we can hope that the academic establishment</i><br>
<i>&gt;          will take over when we have carried it through half way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
well, you certainly have very rigorous criteria for people to meet before<br>
it is even acceptable for them to have an opinion! research and so forth<br>
are very important for making changes, but quicksilver ideas and<br>
impressions are not an inconsiderable part of mimetic construction.<br>
further, I continue to maintain that just being human and spontaneous is<br>
valuable and interesting.<br>
