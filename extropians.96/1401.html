I speculate that "intelligence" has many components. Among the more<br>
important<br>
compnents are the knowlwdge base and the speed, as you also speculate.<br>
I'd<br>
add that interactions between the speed and the knowledge are likely to<br>
constitute an important additional component. For purposes of the<br>
feedback,<br>
we can restrict the discussion of inteligence to "technical creative<br>
intelligence." Other types of intellectual acrtivity are important and<br>
valuable, but not relevant to the feedback mechanism.<br>
<p>
As it happens, the argumant for a rapid feedback mechanism doesn't<br>
depend<br>
on the whole mechanism of intelligence. It depends on some assumptions<br>
that<br>
are IMO simpler and more obvious:<br>
    1) Speed and knowledge base are important components of<br>
intelligence.<br>
    2) We will be able to increase the both the speed and the knowlege<br>
base<br>
       of existing humans by using computers and new software and<br>
interfaces.<br>
    3) A more intelligent researcher can develop a better understanding<br>
of<br>
       the basis of intelligence, and can therefore increase<br>
intelligence<br>
       further, either through better computer hardware and software or<br>
by<br>
       other means.<br>
<p>
The get an initial increase from the first two assumptions, which then<br>
leads to<br>
further increases via the third.<br>
