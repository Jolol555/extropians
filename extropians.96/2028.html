Suresh, I understand your concern for the plight of people less fortunate <br>
than yourself, but I think there are a couple of important points you are <br>
overlooking.<br>
<p>
The first is that even though human population has been and continues to <br>
grow rapidly, the average person on Earth today is far wealthier and has <br>
a far greater range of available choices than the average person on Earth <br>
500 years ago. And people today, even the poorest people in the world, <br>
have even greater advantages over people of 1000 years ago, 2000 years <br>
ago, and so on. You might want to think about what causal processes are <br>
responsible for this change.<br>
<p>
The second is that you are essentially deciding for yourself how resources<br>
ought to be allocated among various people, and arguing (implicitly, I'll<br>
admit) that the allocation that you favor should be imposed by force.<br>
People sometimes accuse extropians of being arrogant, but it has been my<br>
experience that extropians usually do not display the kind of arrogance<br>
that I am pointing out here. <br>
<p>
I think it is very important that each individual should aspire to decide<br>
for emself what to believe and what to value. But the desires and beliefs<br>
of a single individual are practically worthless as a guide to how all the<br>
resources in the world should be allocated, and I cannot help but view<br>
people who think otherwise as potential dictators and long-term threats.<br>
Bill Gates and Lee Iacocca, two people you singled out for criticism, each<br>
control a teeny tiny sliver of the world economy. To compare the wealth of<br>
these wealthy men to the wealth of the poorest people and seek to inspire<br>
envy of it misses the point that individuals at both ends of the wealth<br>
spectrum control only tiny pieces of the global economy. In the long run<br>
it is good ideas, effectively communicated, that shape history, not the<br>
quicksilver flow of money, which merely serves as a communications medium<br>
about who wants what where and when. <br>
<p>
My own limited studies of history have convinced me that people in <br>
positions of political power have done far more damage to the world than <br>
people in positions of economic power, and I don't understand how the <br>
changes you are proposing could be carried out without entrusting <br>
responsibility for the allocation of resources to politically powerful <br>
(but presumably benevolent) individuals. Politically powerful individuals <br>
have even less incentive to be sensitive to the desires of the less <br>
powerful than wealthy individuals do. I'd be much more interested in the <br>
programs you are outlining if you could explain to me how they might be <br>
carried into practice by some means *other* than mandates and <br>
prohibitions issued by committees of politically powerful individuals and <br>
enforced at gunpoint. Because in these sorts of things, choice of the <br>
right means is just as important to me as choice of the right ends. As <br>
Ursula LeGuin quipped in THE DISPOSSESSED, the means are the end.<br>
