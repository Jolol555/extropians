Possible or at least add a pinch of dynamic optimism to each. Problem is<br>
that people are attracted to Entropy with doom and gloom. It's only bad<br>
when they're experiencing it. People love to see disaster from a distance<br>
but don't like it when the disaster is happening to them. This is the same<br>
way humor works with people making fun of an individual but not liking it<br>
when people make fun of them.<br>
