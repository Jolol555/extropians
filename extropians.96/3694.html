This is a variant of an old gambler's fallacy.  Make a nearly even bet.  If<br>
you lose, double your bet and do it again.  Repeat until you win, at which<br>
point you have gained your original bet.  <br>
<p>
This fails because there is a chance of losing everything you have, and that<br>
chance outweighs the likely small gain.<br>
<p>
To put this in context, there's about a 75% chance that you'd have the entire<br>
population of planet earth in the room and still no double sixes.<br>
