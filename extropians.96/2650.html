<i>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this assumes that ANYONE should be "in power" Look at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the biggest organisms on the planet- coral reefs, Mangroves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; underground</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; molds, and hyperthermophilic communities in the earth's crust. The HTP</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; biomass is estimated to exceed 90% of all the living mass on the planet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; None of these has anything like a central authority, yet they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most successful organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Popular opinion (including mine) has it that _we_ are the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; successful organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Here's an analogy, using an idea of a possible alien judgement on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; superior species on the planet:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The most superior species on the planet must be the cereal grains. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; occupy all the best real estate, are tended to by an autonomous species</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which propagates the cereal's seed, and have a whole host of species</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which serve one or more of their needs. They absorb the vast majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the solar flux, as well as material natural resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Success in this universe is determined by who survives.  If it came</i><br>
<i>&gt; down to a battle of life or death between humans and cereal - my</i><br>
<i>&gt; money's with the humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Of course your money is with humans, you are one. But if it's just who<br>
survives, then my bet is with the hypertheormophilic bacteria. Using<br>
Mars as an example, the latest word is that a Martian meteroite tested<br>
by British scientists which is only 600,000 years old has the same life<br>
traces as the 15 million year old rock publicized earlier. This second<br>
rock is from a period of maritan history when the environment was pretty<br>
much the same as it is right now, leading to the high possibility that<br>
there are still such organisms in volvanic vents and under the crust of<br>
Mars.<br>
<p>
SO if simple survival proves superiority, the HTP bugs will be here long<br>
after we are gone.<br>
