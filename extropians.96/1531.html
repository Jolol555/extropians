&lt;I'vd been reading a book, "The Conscious Mind" by David Chalmers&gt;<br>
<p>
Chalmers also has a Web essay summarizing some of the book that's called<br>
"Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness" and resides at<br>
<a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/consciousness.html">http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/consciousness.html</a><br>
<p>
Hara adds:<br>
&lt;Chalmers takes the notion that qualia, or our direct experience of<br>
phenomena as a indication that consciousness is irreducible and not<br>
explainable as part of other systems, such as materialism.&gt;<br>
<p>
I had a hard time with this too.  In the Web essay, Chalmers says:<br>
&lt;When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing,<br>
*but there is also* a subjective aspect.&gt; (My emphasis)<br>
<p>
I've never been convinced that subjective experience is somehow distinct<br>
from this "whir of information-processing", from the memory<br>
storage/retrieval effort and the associated emotional markers we've used<br>
to index those memories.<br>
<p>
Are functional models of the mind as software _just_, to borrow some<br>
words from Reilly Jones (9/28/96), "epistemological models we impose on<br>
whatever is actually going on in there, most likely just bits of stuff<br>
bumping around in preferred directions", or do they have some utility? <br>
Can we usefully talk about patterns of thought being independent of the<br>
hardware/wetware on which they're processed (as Moravec has suggested?) <br>
Are our subjective experiences objective at some level as David Musick<br>
has suggested (9/27/96)?<br>
<p>
Hara Ra trails off with:<br>
&lt;[Chalmers] discussion of quantum mechanics is also interesting, in<br>
particular his view toward Emmet's ideas which are often misstated as<br>
the "many worlds" interpretation of QM.&gt;<br>
<p>
Please, tell us more!<br>
