Modern technology may be no match versus a controlled media, plus <br>
a gullible population.  I told people as we watched the TV reports <br>
of over 100 witnesses of a missile hit, that this will all be covered<br>
up in a few weeks. Nobody believed me: " Ian, there it is right on TV, <br>
over a hundred witnesses! How could they possibly sweep this away ? " <br>
Well, they are, with NO contrary evidence, and everyone is buying it<br>
without question -- are you?  Here's govt-media truth-control in action: <br>

        The Associated Press (9/16/96) reports that the FBI slamed<br>
        non-governmental  Internet reports that TWA flight 800 was <br>
        taken out by a missile from a  military  boat.  The  FBI's <br>
        chief crash investigator James Kallstrom, reportedly said, <br>
        ``It's just not true... It's an outrageous allegation.'' <br>
<p>
        How can Mr. Kallstrom be so  100%  sure ? Is he conducting <br>
        an investigation or a cover-up ?  Let's look at the facts:<br>
<p>
        On July 23,  ABC News  reported that  investigators of the <br>
        TWA flight 800 crash had gathered  over  100  eyewitnesses, <br>
        including  two  active  duty  military  pilots,  who  said <br>
        that  flight  800  was  hit  with a flare-like object that<br>
        streaked  toward the plane  immediately  before it blew-up.<br>
        The  military pilots  who witnessed the object and ensuing <br>
        explosion called the flying object  "a missile."  Over 100 <br>
        witnesses is  OVERWHELMING  evidence of a missile hit.<br>
<p>
        The Washington Times (7/24) mentioned the ABC News story:<br>
<p>
           "Several eyewitnesses, including an Air National <br>
           Guard pilot flying in the area when the explosion <br>
           occurred, have told the FBI they saw a bright, <br>
           flare-like object streaking toward the jumbo jet <br>
           seconds before it blew up. ABC News said yesterday <br>
           that the investigators had more then  100  eyewitness <br>
           accounts supporting the theory."      ^^^<br>
<p>
        When asked at a news conference if the  flying object was <br>
        ascending or descending,  an  FBI spokesman said that all <br>
        witnesses  said it was  "ascending,"  i.e., it was rising <br>
        from the ocean up toward the plane, as if from a boat.<br>
        But now this is suddenly "outrageous."  Big Lie 101.<br>
<p>
        On July 19, the Associated Press reported that  radar had <br>
        picked  up what appeared to be an  object  racing  toward <br>
        flight 800, but then  secret gov agents stuff the report:<br>
<p>
            "There were reports that radar detected a blip <br>
            merging with the jet shortly before the explosion, <br>
            something that could indicate a missile hit. But<br>
            Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of <br>
            anonymity, said government analysts have studied <br>
            several radar reports of the area and the blip <br>
            was found to be a spurious signal."<br>
<p>
        100+ witnesses AND radar reports of an approaching object.<br>
        Obviously  the  initial  report  of  a  " blip "   moving <br>
        toward the doomed  flight came from those  who  witnessed <br>
        the  "blip,"  while the  follow-up came from an  official<br>
        requesting secrecy who represents the branch of govt that <br>
        stands to be directly  IMPLICATED  by a missile hit. Gee, <br>
        you don't have to be a rocket scientist to add this up. <br>
<p>
        REPORTER: Over  100 witnesses saw a missile hit the plane, <br>
        two  witnesses  were  military  pilots, and  radar showed <br>
        a "blip" moving toward the plane.  Mr.  military official, <br>
        it sounds like this could have been  military missile hit. <br>
<p>
        MILITARY OFFICIAL:  No,  NO ! Those signals were spurious, <br>
        who can trust military equipment.  D'oh,  I mean... uh uh.<br>
        It was those witnesses, ya, they were, uh, were on  drugs, <br>
        ya ya, that's it.  We're  innocent,  PLEASE  BELIEVE  ME." <br>
<p>
        REPORTER: OK. The military is innocent. Back to you Dan...<br>
<p>
        Can you imagine a court case with over  100  witnesses who <br>
        all tell the same story, plus the "photographic"  evidence <br>
        of radar ( there is even a photograph  taken right  before <br>
        the hit that was shown on many  stations  and can be  seen <br>
        at--&gt;  <a href="http://teaminfinity.com:80/800/Missile.jpg">http://teaminfinity.com:80/800/Missile.jpg</a> ). Would <br>
        such a court case be a blow out or what ? People, wake up.<br>
