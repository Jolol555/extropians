Hi.<br>
<p>
I too have often wondered why there aren't any real concrete action plans or<br>
organizations within the extropian community.  <br>
<p>
As a whole, there is a tremendous amount of intelligence and intellectual<br>
capacity on this list.  Individually, I suspect that most of the people on<br>
this list have considerably more motivation and intelligence than the<br>
average person on the street, and many have demonstrated an impressive array<br>
of talents.  <br>
<p>
As much as I like the kind of random wanderings of topics on this list, I<br>
often wonder what we could accomplish if we focused on a goal more specific<br>
than "promoting extropianism" and discussing "extropian topics".  I believe<br>
that with motivation, focus, and organization we could very possibly become<br>
a think-tank with unprecedented productive capabilities and intellectual<br>
prowess.  If we could harness the vast capability of the people on this<br>
list, I believe there is very little that we could not accomplish.<br>
<p>
Instead of just discussing specific problems or issues, we should<br>
agressively pursue and attack these issues.  We should be more aggressively<br>
involved in research.  I think far more people would be interested in<br>
extropianism if we had concrete accomplishments and active, productive research.<br>
<p>
As Eliezer mentioned, we should start building concrete plans towards<br>
concrete goals.  The first step of accomplishing anything is to set a<br>
concrete goal, and the next step is to develop a concrete plan on how to get<br>
there.  I'm just curious, but has any extropian or group of extropians<br>
started a company devoted to developing extropian technologies (or for that<br>
matter, started any company at all)?  This might not only advantageous to<br>
the extropian "cause", but it might be profitable as well.  I am sure there<br>
is enough experience on this list to start almost any type of venture.  I<br>
personally have started a couple high-tech startups, and it isn't terribly<br>
difficult, or even necessarily too expensive, although it is time consuming.<br>
Being actively involved in any technology industry allows one to subtly (or<br>
not so subtly) introduce new concepts and influence ideas.  Extropianism<br>
could spread almost subliminally in the guise of useful products with<br>
embedded extropian themes.  Additionally, this would give extropians more<br>
influence and money that would allow more effective spreading of extropian<br>
ideas and concepts.  Prominent individuals promoting extropianism could be<br>
very effective.  If extropians could become successful or wealthy, this<br>
would add prominence to the organization.<br>
<p>
Also, has anyone ever tried to organize some type of extropian community (in<br>
a physical, not virtual sense)?  Or maybe something like Arcosanti?  I feel<br>
that there is a certain limit to the impact a loose-knit, philosophical<br>
organization can have if they don't have any physical presence or direction.<br>
We need something concrete that people will associate with extropians.<br>
Right now, it is just "that philosophical organization".<br>
<p>
I guess it is kind of like the old capitalist saying "It takes money to make<br>
money".  We have ideas, we just need to work on building something concrete<br>
with them.  Once the ball is rolling, extropian influence and ideas will<br>
spread much more quickly.  The more extropians there are and the more<br>
influence extropian ideas have, the easier it will be to gain additional<br>
influence and "converts".  The difference between self-made millionaires and<br>
everyone else is that the millionaires took action while most everyone else<br>
simply talks about taking action.  <br>
<p>
This should be enough rambling for one post ;)<br>
