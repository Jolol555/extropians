<i>&gt; Do you know someone who tried to construct a language as a tool for</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking? </i><br>
<p>
I am not aware of any existing language experiments of this nature.  <br>
But that may just be due to my own ignorance since i am not a <br>
linguist.<br>
<p>
I do, however, have quite a few ideas of my own on this subject.  I've <br>
toyed with this "thought language" concept for many years.<br>
<p>
Perhaps some of us should get together to create something.  If <br>
successful, it would be a way to become something better in the near <br>
term, while still persuing more long term improvements.  A very <br>
transhumanist endeavor.<br>
<p>
When I was in high school, I formulated the crude beginnings of such<br>
a language.  The language was represented in two dimentions, and<br>
thus could be shown on paper.  Objects (ideas) were represented by<br>
strings of symbols, just like any other modern human languages.  But<br>
the relationships between those ideas was, for the most part,<br>
represented graphically, by means of different sizes, relative<br>
positioning of the objects, and linking symbols.  A very prominent<br>
relationship was "containment", which was shown simply by drawing  a<br>
closed figure associated with each object. This closed figure would<br>
then contain other objects that contribute to it, which could in turn<br>
contain still more objects.  An object representing the actor, might<br>
contain the act, which might in turn contain the thing acted upon. <br>
A graphical symbol might then link this to another set of nested<br>
objects describing the state of affairs that proceeded as a result<br>
of the actor's actions.  This structure would imply that the main <br>
idea being expressed is that this particular actor is responsible for <br>
some resulting state of affairs.  The rest is finer detail.  It could <br>
be structured very differently if the main concern were the way in <br>
which all of this had affected the object that was acted upon.<br>
<p>
My reasoning for having a hierarchical (or layered)  structure like this<br>
is that a single document could then be "read" at varying levels of<br>
detail and still be meaningful.<br>
<p>
For example, a quick glance at a document describing a computer<br>
might reveal the outermost "layer" of the description, which might be <br>
simply a symbol that represents the idea "computer" (very much like <br>
the function that the word "computer" serves in English).  This then <br>
would contain other objects representing various aspects of a <br>
computer, such as software, hardware, history, etc.  These would then <br>
contain further detail describing programming languages, busses, <br>
logic gates, transistors, electrochemistry, etc.<br>
<p>
This kind of structure could be greatly facilitated by using<br>
computers.  A "reader" could literally zoom in to get a more detailed<br>
understanding of something, or zoom out to see the "big picture".<br>
