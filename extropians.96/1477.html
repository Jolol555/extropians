It's hard to imagine anyone wanting to be on a second-class version of this<br>
list.<br>

I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said "I'm sorry I wrote such a long<br>
letter.  Had I had more time, I would have written a shorter one."  Rather<br>
than restricting message length, however, I think this list could benefit<br>
from a limit on the number of messages any individual can post on any given<br>
day.  Would three be sufficient?  (Sorry, only one subject per message.)<br>
<p>
I would at least try that before resorting to forced segregation.<br>
