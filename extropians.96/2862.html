The electron in a Hydrogen atom can be in 2 states, "spin up" or "spin down", <br>
and you can differentiate between the two by using The Zeeman Effect. Also, <br>
an atom doesn't have to stay in its ground state. If R is the radius of the <br>
orbital of the electron in its ground state, you could also, with a very <br>
specific amount of energy, place it in a lager orbital of radius n^2 R where <br>
n is any integer. When the electron falls into a lower orbital, either <br>
spontaneously or through stimulus emission as in a LASER, it will emit a <br>
photon of light. You can tell from the amount of energy in that photon what <br>
orbital the electron must have been in. After you have read the memory in <br>
this way you'd need to fire a photon back at the atom to push the electron <br>
back to it's original orbital, but there is nothing new in dynamic memory. <br>
You wouldn't be limited to the electron either, you could do many of the same <br>
sort of things with the nucleus, but you'd have to deal with Gamma rays. <br>
And I haven't even mentioned the weird stuff the Quantum Computer people <br>
talk about. <br>
<p>
Drexler, the conservative engineer that he is, apparently doesn't think any <br>
of this will be important until after the Singularity, certainly his plain  <br>
Jane Nanotechnology doesn't make use of any of these exotic possibilities.  <br>
That's why Nanotechnology is a technology not a science. <br>
