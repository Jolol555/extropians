Let's say the universe really splits each time it has to decide if the cat<br>
is dead or alive. No one knows how to prove that this is really the case,<br>
right? But what if you yourself took the place of the cat, and ran the<br>
experiment. Then you ran the experiment again, umpteen times, and observed<br>
that you are still alive. If the many-worlds theory is true, you will<br>
always survive in one of the "new" universes, with knowledge of your<br>
history of good luck. Thus you would have ascertained the splitting nature<br>
of the universe(?).<br>
<p>
Someone must have come up with this earlier, since it is so obvious,<br>
but I've had this idea for years and had to ask.<br>
