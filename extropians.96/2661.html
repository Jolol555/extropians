The idea that sex has only one evolutionary function is too simple.<br>
Very little in our makeup has "one function," and the longer something<br>
stays around, the more functions it gets involved in.  Sex has been<br>
around a long time.<br>
<p>
It's another case where people are imagining an evolved system minus this<br>
or that integral part.  Doesn't generally work that way, folks.  Evolution<br>
keeps things.  The longer they've been around, the less likely they are<br>
to be dispensable.<br>
<p>
Sex has a function in culture, the meme pool.  So even non-biological<br>
evolution will need to hold on to it.  Something similar probably goes<br>
for human-like sexual differentiation and the gender memes that are<br>
allied with it, for instance, although gender as we know it is a more<br>
recent invention.<br>
<p>
Besides, any sort of code-swapping between replicator sets *is* sex.<br>
Recombo is the *main* reason for sex, so we might expect analogs to<br>
the paraphenalia of sex to evolve alongside any meme-poolery.<br>
<p>
The epithet "hormone driven" also strikes me as way uninformed<br>
for a discussion among extropians.  Hormones are communication signals<br>
between parts in complex systems.  Don't kill the system because of<br>
its...messenger.  It's like saying that a certain part of a computer is<br>
"green-wire-driven" because it happens to have a green wire in it.<br>
So what?  And where is the part of your brain that is *not* hormone-<br>
driven??  We're talking neurotransmitters, folks!  Axon to dentryte,<br>
axon to dentryte, helLO-o!<br>
<p>
The main thing I see in these simplistic notions is an attatchment<br>
to old-fashioned prudery.  There's a better thing to evolve out of.<br>
