Violence can also come about from fundamental incompossibility of<br>
desires.  Babylon-5 example: Londo and G'Kar understand one another<br>
perfectly, or could do so with minimal effort.  They clash not because<br>
of a lack of communication, but because both serve their people, and<br>
both perceive the interests of their people as clashing with the other.<br>
If there's anything they don't understand, it's their own long-term<br>
interest.  They don't need telepathy, they need a collective boot to the<br>
head.<br>

Privacy is a right I claim for myself, like physical integrity.  It<br>
takes effort to establish and maintain, but so does life.  <br>
<p>
The instincts I throw out are the ones I can explain and whose<br>
justifications I don't like; or those which clearly conflict with my<br>
established interest.  Privacy does not do the latter, I don't have a<br>
good reason to dump it, and since I'm not sure why I _do_ feel so<br>
strongly about it, I'm inclined to think that there is a good evolved<br>
[not genetic] reason for it which I haven't reproduced yet.  So I keep<br>
it.<br>
