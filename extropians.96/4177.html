<i>                &gt;materials do what they do on a chemical level.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I am sure that all of the above is true.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;What part don't I understand?</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
If you understand how a computer does arithmetic you must understand what  <br>
the machine will do, what its output will be, when it takes 5203 to the 127 <br>
power. So tell me, what is 5203 ^127?  My point is that somebody could be <br>
very familiar with every one on the 26 letters in the English Language but <br>
still not understand the subtly in Shakespeare.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I *do* understand turbulence (as well as anyone does).  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I will concede that you do understand turbulence, as well as anyone does.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;our difficulty in adequately describing turbulence has to do                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;with the complexity of the system   </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I agree. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;a level of complexity not found in the study of elementary                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;arithmetic logic structures.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
It's true that the sort of complexity seen in turbulence is not found in the <br>
structure of a CPU, but it is found in the operation of a CPU.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;It sounds like you are saying that it is impossible for                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;humans to truly understand anything.   </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
No, I admit that you know a lot, I know one or two things myself, I'm saying  <br>
it is impossible for humans to truly understand everything.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;You can duplicate the binary computational sequence by                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;arranging and moving pebbles.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Certainly true, and then nobody would understand pebbles.<br>
