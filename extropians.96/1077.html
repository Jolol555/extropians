<p>
The 'official' argument is in Ayn Rand's collection of essays 'The Voice of<br>
Reason': Peter Schwartz's 'Libertarianism: The Perversion of Liberty'<br>
<p>
Essentially, the argument is that Libertarians are harmful to the ideas of<br>
capitalism and individual freedom in that they advocate them while rejecting<br>
or ignoring the underlying philosophical foundations: objective reality,<br>
knowledge and ethics. They can therefore not logically and morally defend<br>
personal and economic freedom, nor do they have the tools to rationally<br>
define or resolve political issues.<br>
<p>
I completely agree with this criticism. However, for me it does not follow<br>
that libertarians are 'more evil than communists' - I just think that they<br>
are mistaken in rejecting rational ethics. Objectivists' hatred seems to be<br>
an irrational, non-objective over-reaction born out of contempt for<br>
libertarians who 'should know better', who are 'traitors to Objectivism' and<br>
who, in any case should have recognized Aye Rand as their leader.<br>
