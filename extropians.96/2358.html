<i>&gt;The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were </i><br>
<i>&gt;physical matter. Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move </i><br>
<i>&gt;information (as opposed to copying) is a fundamental limitation of all </i><br>
<i>&gt;information systems.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.</i><br>
<p>
We can still live in a virtual world though with the laws of physics<br>
altered at our whims and AI civilizations created and destroyed for your<br>
entertainment. (Oh no! Here comes the AI civil liberties organization!)<br>
In this scenario we do have the choice of either being a brain in a jar<br>
with i/o streams feeding into a PC or we can augment our existing body<br>
everyway we can think of and have a brain-PC interface builtin to our<br>
genome such as communication with a PC via bat radar signals or tendrils on<br>
the back of the neck which are a direct link to our brain. If this is true,<br>
it doesn't matter much to me because I'd be satisfied with the 'greek god'<br>
idea because I could still create entire universes in a virtual world as<br>
well as have access to the continuously growing pool of human intelligence<br>
plus gain immortality. Can silicon actually support life? If this is true<br>
that we are required to 'move' data then Strong AI will never come about or<br>
live in a quasi-consciousness where it continually lives/dies/lives/dies.<br>
John, I'm looking for a reply on this one.<br>
