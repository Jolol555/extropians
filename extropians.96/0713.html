Short answer, I don't know, but you could ask the question in another way.  <br>
If big brains were so hard to make, why did they happen so soon after hands <br>
developed that were nearly ready to be used by them?  <br>
                  <br>

If you take the average of all animals on earth then that's true, but we're <br>
not interested in all animals, just the ones that led up to humans because <br>
they're the ones that made it through the filter, we hope. The brains of our <br>
ancestors got almost 5 times as big in just 3 million years, and it all <br>
started at the same moment we developed a first rate hand. Perhaps it's jus<br>
t a coincidence, but one thing is certain, that is not an ordinary increase <br>
in brain size, that is extraordinary.<br>
