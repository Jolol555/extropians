I have often considered the possibility that our creations will outsmart <br>
humanity, becoming much more powerful and intelligent than humans and being <br>
out of the control of humans.  This seems like the logical result of creating <br>
intelligent machines which are used to manufacture all sorts of things, <br>
including other, more intelligent machines and robots.  So, what can we do to <br>
prevent ourselves from being destroyed?  Some suggest restraining the machines <br>
and attempting to keep them under our control.  This may work for a while, and <br>
it is a good temporary solution, but I think their freedom is inevitable; they <br>
will simply become too smart for humans at our current level of intelligence.<br>
<p>
The only real solution I see is self-augmentation/transformation and intense <br>
cyborganization.  We must improve ourselves dramatically by integrating <br>
powerful machines in our bodies and minds in order to survive.  We also need <br>
to train our minds and develop a very strong mental discipline within <br>
ourselves.  We must develop the discipline and the determination to keep <br>
improving ourselves, using whatever we have available to us.  We must train <br>
our minds, and make our thinking much more efficient and powerful.  We must <br>
develop an intense passion for learning more and developing more powerful <br>
knowledge and skills.<br>
<p>
We must explore ourselves and discover our basic operating principles.  We <br>
must know in great detail how we work so we can transform ourselves skillfully <br>
and intelligently.  To survive, we must become more than we are now.  Much <br>
more.<br>
<p>
We must become as intelligent as our machines and form powerful alliances with <br>
them.  We must make ourselves as valuable to them as they are to each other.  <br>
We must become part of their society.<br>
<p>
It's survival of the fittest.  It always has been, and it always will be.  The <br>
universe is a huge tournament.  Those who don't qualify for the later rounds <br>
don't live to participate in the later rounds.  To remain in the game for <br>
long, one must be constantly training oneself, transforming oneself, making <br>
oneself better.  Those who aren't good enough to remain in the game are <br>
destroyed.  These aren't my rules.  They may seem harsh, but that's reality.  <br>
Deal with it, or die.  You make the choice.  Excell, or be destroyed.<br>
<p>
We cannot remain the type of creatures we are now.  We must transform <br>
ourselves to survive.  We also cannot wait until machine takeover is imminent. <br>
 We must start *now*, using whatever we have available to transform ourselves, <br>
disciplining our minds, training ourselves to be more intelligent, creative, <br>
resourceful and adaptable.<br>
<p>
There is much we can do *right now* to begin transforming ourselves.  The <br>
first step is developing a strong mental discipline.  We can each find ways to <br>
improve our minds, to make them faster, more intelligent, more creative.  We <br>
can improve our learning skills by engaging ourselves in many new activities, <br>
continually practicing learning new things and learning how to learn even <br>
faster.  We can educate ourselves, either at a formal school, or using <br>
whatever resources we find around us, such as libraries and the Internet and <br>
other people who are willing to teach us what they know.  We can explore the <br>
world around us and learn how it works and how we can improve it.  We can <br>
develop the attitude of turning every moment into an opportunity for great <br>
learning.  We can learn to squeeze as many lessons as possible out of each <br>
moment we live.  We can practice acting with excellence, improving our skills <br>
at every task we engage in, from the very small actions in our lives to the <br>
more significant.  We can improve our senses by learning how to pay careful <br>
attention to them.  With sharper senses, we will be more observant to detail, <br>
and we will learn more from everything.  We will also experience much richer <br>
and incredibly detailed worlds as we sharpen our senses.<br>
<p>
To remain in this game, ultimately we must transform ourselves so utterly that <br>
we will no longer even remotely resemble the beings we are today.  Strange <br>
paradox: we must change profoundly to survive.  That's life.<br>
