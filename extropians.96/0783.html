<i>&gt;right in front of their face.  Just like it is easy for me to ignore fashion </i><br>
<i>&gt;polls and god-knows-what-else </i><br>
hehe the meme has sunken into our language!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	Most Christians don't value truth or rational arguments, so they will simply </i><br>
<i>&gt;ignore these things, much to the chagrin of those, like us, who do.  </i><br>
Then why do they claim they "seek the truth"?<br>
<p>
At least there is one good force pushing atheism. Public school peer<br>
pressure converts all except the MOST severe cases of christianity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once they know how to reason well, they will start questioning their own </i><br>
<i>&gt;assumptions, and you can help them through the debunking process, but not </i><br>
<i>&gt;until they're ready, not until they start doing it on their own.</i><br>
Yeah true<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;	Unfortanately, it doesn't seem like you've fully recovered from Christianity </i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself.  </i><br>
Well, I must admit. Smidgets of the meme remain and I am squishing them when<br>
I notice them so thanks for pointing that out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If their religion is stifling them, then they will move beyond it, if their</i><br>
true <br>
<i>&gt;commitment is to increasing Extropy.</i><br>
Very True<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And I think that the best strategy (somewhat </i><br>
<i>&gt;contrary to what I wrote previously about offending people's minds, but then I </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't try to be consistent; I'm still learning, after all), is to quietly </i><br>
<i>&gt;infiltrate various belief systems and insert some well-designed memes that </i><br>
<i>&gt;will promote increasing Extropy.  We must attach these memes to the religion </i><br>
<i>&gt;itself somehow, so that it becomes a very important part of the religion, or </i><br>
<i>&gt;at least of the belief systems of the members of the religion.  Most religions </i><br>
<i>&gt;I know of already have a lot of Extropian components, so it will mainly be a </i><br>
<i>&gt;matter of stressing those aspects more and slightly rearranging things so that </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Extropian Values are seen as very important by the members of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;religion.  We should bring as little foreign material into the religion as we </i><br>
<i>&gt;can, but instead work with the religion itself to transform it into something </i><br>
<i>&gt;more Extropian than it already is.</i><br>
I believe this is already being done. I saw a book awhile back in a magazine<br>
called "GOD wants our us to thrive" or something of the sort which<br>
supposedly dealt with the idea that the christian GOD wants planet earth to<br>
grow, develop, get better and better and make people happy. If only I could<br>
find that book!<br>
