<i>                &gt;have a continuous stream of awareness from bio to electro,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;but any perfect copy should by definition do so. </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
What you say above and what you say below can't both be right. I think what  <br>
you say above is correct.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;You have not presented any evidence that if I were to do a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;flash upload, that my "stream of consciousness" that I </i><br>
<i>                &gt;consider to be "me" would not cease, even though there would </i><br>
<i>                &gt;be a perfectly operating electronic copy of me insisting that </i><br>
<i>                &gt;it feels fine.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Not so, I presented excellent evidence that I am still alive after I am fast  <br>
uploaded, namely I produced something that has my memories, acts just like me, <br>
and insists that he is indeed me.  As good as this evidence is, I admit it <br>
falls short of a proof. You will NEVER be able to prove that my upload, <br>
fast or slow, has my consciousness, but then, you can't even prove I had <br>
consciousness before the upload, just as I can NEVER prove you are conscious. <br>
Nobody worries about being the only conscious being in the universe because in <br>
our hart every human being on this planet takes it as an axiom of existence <br>
that when something act's intelligent it is conscious. For the same reason, <br>
I don't worry about an upload who act's just like me not being me.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I believe that the technology for slow gradual uploads will                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;develop much sooner than a flash upload capability. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It seems to me that a destructive upload would probably be easier to do than <br>
a non destructive one.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Frankly, you sound more like a religious  dogmatic, willing                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to take a leap of faith, than I. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I honestly don't know what more I can do. I examine 2 physical systems, I can  <br>
find absolutely no difference in them, I conclude there is no difference. <br>
Where is the faith? If There is no physical difference, and you say you don't  <br>
believe in superstitious mumbo jumbo, then the question remains, what exactly  <br>
is the difference?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Tell me: Are you so positive that you would flash upload                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;this instant, given the chance?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
YES! In a heartbeat.<br>
