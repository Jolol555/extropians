<i>&gt;I noticed that same thing, being raised a Catholic and all... I suppose</i><br>
<i>&gt;that transhumanism is a way for me to reconcile my intellectual need for</i><br>
<i>&gt;reason, to the hope for becoming greater than oneself, transcending,</i><br>
<i>&gt;becoming one with the ALL, that has been taught as Catholic Dogma and</i><br>
<i>&gt;demanded as faith in spite of the past 2000 years of showing little</i><br>
<i>&gt;improvement in situation of mans inhumanity to man. That following the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Golden Rule and keeping an open, inquisitive mind one day at a time, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;person at a time will boot strap us all to a better tomorrow.</i><br>
<p>
When I was a little kid, my parents used to tell me about satan and demons<br>
and such and how I had to pray to keep them away. When I was younger my<br>
parents were religious zealots although they've lightened up in their old<br>
age. (ie. When I was born, they had never heard of colic and they were<br>
afraid I'd die so they baptized me at home!! hahaha! And this is in Los<br>
Angeles, CA people!!) I have slight Tourettes (noone even notices it) as<br>
well as my younger brother who has it quite worse than I but a side effect<br>
of this seems to be a highly active imagination so when I had Tourette<br>
panic attacks when I was a kid it was due alot of times to their telling me<br>
of demons and satan and when I finally fought back the religious crap I<br>
realized a greater sense of reality as opposed to the more imaginary<br>
metaphysical religious world I viewed previously and had far fewer panic<br>
attacks. I also think it was due to puberty setting on that my Tourettes<br>
faded but I also think atheism played an integral part. Could it be very<br>
tramatic and damaging for some kids to be exposed to religion?<br>
