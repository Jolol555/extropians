<p>
 I can't see any signs of a sudden change in feedback mechanisms.<br>
It's silly to expect the first assemblers to be easily programmed general<br>
purpose devices, for the same reason that it would have been silly to<br>
expect the first computer to run Smalltalk. There will be a number of<br>
constraints imposed on designs by the limits on what is chemically<br>
stable, and it will take a lot of trial and error before we know how<br>
to handle those limits well.<br>

<i>&gt;Of course there are feedback mechanisms.  But that doesn't imply fast </i><br>
<i>&gt;change, only change at some speed.   Imagining, designing, testing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;tuning, marketing, etc. of designs all takes time and intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;And make no mistake - nanotech design is HARD.  These are very complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;machines that are imagined.</i><br>
<p>
 Very complex? Most of the nanotech designs I've heard people talking<br>
about can be fully specified (at atomic level precision) in minutes<br>
worth of communication. That will obviously change as the designs grow<br>
more powerfull, but my guess is that nanotech devices will often be<br>
much simpler than corresponding low-tech devices. I agree with the<br>
rest of your conclusions here, but doubt that complexity explains them.<br>

<i>&gt;I agree that the 18 month doubling rate of capacity is likely to</i><br>

<i>&gt;the "IQ" of the researchers involved.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If this doubling rate were very sensitive to the total number or</i><br>

 This assumes the employers would get much of the benefits. There<br>
are obvious free-rider problems with many kinds of research.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;process.   If it depended sensitively on the IQ of these researchers, </i><br>
<i>&gt;a higher premium would be placed on hiring high IQ researchers.  </i><br>
<p>
 Can a higher premium be usefully placed on IQ? My impression is that<br>
the most successfull employers value IQ or something equivalent above<br>
all other features in their hiring decisions. It isn't clear that<br>
higher incomes will attract more high IQ people - those that are<br>
influenced significantly by money in their choice of jobs usually<br>
can get equity with a high expected value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To the contrary, there are lots of good ideas, and the big expense is</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing the grunge work of trying them out.  Raw smarts helps a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;in picking the winners, but not that much.  How much grunge work gets</i><br>
<i>&gt;done depends on the size of the global market for computers.  </i><br>
<p>
 Raw intelligence does affect the speed and quality with which the<br>
tasks you are calling "grunge work" get done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Tightly integrated self-augmentation groups *have* been tried, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;poor success.  The fact is that progress depends much more on lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;little improvements across the whole economy than many people want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;admit.  </i><br>
<p>
 Now that's a stronger and harder to evaluate argument.<br>
