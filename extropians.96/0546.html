We agree that he is not a 'central authority' who lays down the law. However,<br>
I think it perfectly reasonable to consider Max Most the leading public<br>
spokes&gt;human of Extropianism. This does not mean that he has some exclusive,<br>
divine, eternal right to this position. Until his IA implant malfunctions<br>
and he spouts forth Luddite doctrine he can objectively be regarded as our<br>
foremost representative - both in terms of his actions and how he is<br>
perceived by the media. <br>
<p>
He (together with Tom Morrow) coined the term 'Extropian', started the<br>
Extropian movement, edits and publishes Extropy magazine, organizes the<br>
Extro conferences and is more active (through articles, debates &amp;<br>
interviews) in defining and promoting Extropianism than anyone else. Can<br>
anyone claim to be doing more ?<br>
<p>
As far as perception is concerned, Max is clearly recognized by the media<br>
and by most people who know about Extropianism as its leading proponent.<br>
<p>
This does not mean that we always agree with him, that he is always right or<br>
that others should not express their own opinions. If he doesn't keep<br>
extroping he might even be disposed.<br>
