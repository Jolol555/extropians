But don't you see that Drexlerian nanotech (if indeed feasible) means a <br>
new energetic minimum for the area currently occupied by the squishy ecosphere? <br>
Do you think the Blue Goo will be able to contain the explosive breeding of <br>
Gray Goo?<br>
<p>
Nope, camerado. What one might achieve (though I doubt it) is a tiny <br>
movable "eye of the tornado" with the soft human in the midst, protected <br>
by a bristling perimeter nanoguard. The entire biosphere will be slime. <br>
These humans, which were unprotected, and these where a breach of the ice <br>
occured would be slime. Virtually everything would be slime.<br>
<p>
(After a while, evolution would start anew, beginning from this new <br>
energy minimum. It might achieve sapience, time given. But it won't <br>
feature any squishies).<br>
