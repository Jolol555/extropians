There seeem to be two different scenarios here.  <br>
1. The intelligence in a star system may at some point be no longer<br>
interested in increasing computational ability.<br>
2. The other is that discount rates may colonization not<br>
cost-effective.<br>
<p>
On 1. The effective net values of a star system will be composed of<br>
the values of its many components.  Even if most of these components<br>
suddenly no longer desire computation ability, some components surely<br>
will.  And some components will surely value exploration and<br>
colonization for its own sake.  Even within a group the size of this<br>
list we have a wide variety of goals regarding our futures.<br>
<p>
On 2. Even just looking at the goal of maximizing computation, you<br>
need to remember that discount rates are evolutionarily endogenous.<br>
If there are many different components with different discount rates,<br>
the ones that come to dominate the population are the ones whose<br>
discount rates are best tied to the feasible growth rate.  If solar<br>
system limits are hit, so growth stops, then components who value<br>
longer and longer time scales will come to dominate, until extra-solar<br>
colonization efforts start to look attractive.<br>
