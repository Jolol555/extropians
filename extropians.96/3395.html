Here Darwin is truly generous, granting the stupid even more stupidity.<br>

Apropos diet, some Indian practice(d) coprophagia (in dehydrated form ;), <br>
to make symbiont-synthesized cobalamine (lack of which causes pernicious <br>
anaemia) from intestine flora better bioavailable. The attempt of yogis <br>
to recycle melatonine (already discussed on this list) is noteworthy as <br>
well.<br>

Well, live and learn.<br>

Apropos melatonine, if you are &lt;50 Yrs, don't take it as bolus, use <br>
sustained release form, which doesn't give a stratospheric, but short <br>
serum spike. The receptor concentration is being homeostased, resulting in <br>
adaptation. This might result in a "Dorian Grey" effect, if the dose is <br>
lowered. In one anecdotal case, it resulted in doubling of the therapeutic <br>
dosage after 4 years, I think somebody on this list/CryoNet said he <br>
experienced similiar symptoms.<br>

<i>&gt; lack of seafood in a diet (especially from saltwater sources) has been shown</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have direct impacts on the average intelligence of a population.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; compounds are especially important during childhood.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Iodine is a case in point.  Naturally, iodine is found almost exclusively in</i><br>
<i>&gt; seafood sources.  There is a region in inland China where 1 in 8 people is</i><br>
<i>&gt; technically mentally retarded, and few people in the region have "normal"</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence.  As a whole, the average IQ of people in this region is far</i><br>
<i>&gt; below the human average.  The reason has been determined to be iodine</i><br>
<i>&gt; deficiency.  They have no access to sources of iodine in their diet.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; are genetically normally, but lack of a key compound has rendered them less</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent than their genetically determined capability.  Unfortunately,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the effects of this are structural and irreversible.</i><br>
<p>
Most of Bavaria, Southern Krautland, has been leached almost free of <br>
iodate in the last glacial. Hence, the population, especially the mountain <br>
village inhabitants suffer(ed) from iodine deficiency, which results in <br>
slight mental retardation (which was further aggravated by inbreeding, <br>
especially in mountain valleys) and hypertrophy of the thyroidal <br>
("Kropf"). Interestingly, part of local folklore groups' garb is a kind <br>
of necklace (hung with small silver coins) designed to conceal/ornate the <br>
hypertrophy. (I forgot the name of the piece, but it has "kropf" in it).<br>
<p>
Though iodate/fluorine fortified salt is being sold on the market, sea <br>
fish iodine is considered to be most bioavailable. Eating sea fish one <br>
time a week will also further supply such essential microelements, as <br>
(methyl)mercury, cadmium, and plutonium (if you happen to to live near<br>
the scenic Windscale), PCP, and pesticide metabolites, which like binding <br>
to your hormone receptors, which makes your homeobox somewhat puzzled in <br>
utero. (Boys will be girls, and all that).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Fortunately for many developed countries, iodine is artificially introduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the diet so that this is not a problem.  This may also be why countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; with high seafood diets also are among the highest in raw IQ as well.</i><br>
<p>
Another reason to keep your iodine depot well stocked (and held a couple <br>
of iodate tablets in the cupboard) is the radioiod from reactor cores, <br>
seriously gone China. Those children in the Ukraine (which happens to be <br>
virtually depleted from iodine as well) got their (activated) iodine <br>
supplements as airborne particles. Ever seen firefly kids, glowing in the <br>
dark?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The introduction nootropics into the proto-human diet was very likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for the advance of our species.  I don't know too much about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mushroom theory, but the seafood theory does seem plausible.  AFAIK, humans</i><br>
<p>
Siberian (and probably Scandinavian) Amanita muscaria is psychactive <br>
(but the effects are somewhat drastic, so take care), and was used by <br>
Tungus shamans in their rituals. Yogi's recycling trick was practiced <br>
here, too, as muscarine &amp; Co are virtually nonbiodegradable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; are the only primates that eat seafood.</i><br>
<p>
Humans will eat about anything, especially in a pinch.<br>
