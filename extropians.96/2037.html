<i>&gt; Suresh, I understand your concern for the plight of people less fortunate </i><br>
<i>&gt; than yourself, but I think there are a couple of important points you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; overlooking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first is that even though human population has been and continues to </i><br>
<i>&gt; grow rapidly, the average person on Earth today is far wealthier and has </i><br>
<i>&gt; a far greater range of available choices than the average person on Earth </i><br>
<i>&gt; 500 years ago. And people today, even the poorest people in the world, </i><br>
<i>&gt; have even greater advantages over people of 1000 years ago, 2000 years </i><br>
<i>&gt; ago, and so on. You might want to think about what causal processes are </i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for this change.</i><br>
<p>
True, but the change has not been equitable. The choices available to the <br>
top strata have increased far more than the choices available to the <br>
poor. There are more advantages thanks to technology, but as this is <br>
market driven, the advantages are generally only availible to those who <br>
can afford it. Some trickle down left-overs may make it to the bottom, <br>
but that's it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The second is that you are essentially deciding for yourself how resources</i><br>
<i>&gt; ought to be allocated among various people, and arguing (implicitly, I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; admit) that the allocation that you favor should be imposed by force.</i><br>
<i>&gt; People sometimes accuse extropians of being arrogant, but it has been my</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience that extropians usually do not display the kind of arrogance</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I am pointing out here. </i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry if I come across as arrogant. I'm not deciding for myself. This <br>
has been tried before, in spain, before it was bombed into oblivion by <br>
Franco and Hitler. This is not my theory. It has been proposed by <br>
numerous people more able than I. If capitalism continues as the majority <br>
of extropians hope it does, the polarization of rich and poor will become <br>
so blatant that Marx will be right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it is very important that each individual should aspire to decide</i><br>
<i>&gt; for emself what to believe and what to value. But the desires and beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a single individual are practically worthless as a guide to how all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources in the world should be allocated, and I cannot help but view</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who think otherwise as potential dictators and long-term threats.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bill Gates and Lee Iacocca, two people you singled out for criticism, each</i><br>
<i>&gt; control a teeny tiny sliver of the world economy. To compare the wealth of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these wealthy men to the wealth of the poorest people and seek to inspire</i><br>
<i>&gt; envy of it misses the point that individuals at both ends of the wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; spectrum control only tiny pieces of the global economy. In the long run</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is good ideas, effectively communicated, that shape history, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; quicksilver flow of money, which merely serves as a communications medium</i><br>
<i>&gt; about who wants what where and when. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I agree, but wealth is an indication of power nowadays. For true change, <br>
we're going to need to hear the opinions of everyone, not just the upper <br>
tier committing intellectual incest. I would love to hear the ideas of a <br>
rural Indonesian farmer, but it's not going to happen so long as there is <br>
such a big power imbalance. As for the two people I singled out, a <br>
statistic I heard was that 358 people controlled 45% of the worlds wealth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My own limited studies of history have convinced me that people in </i><br>
<i>&gt; positions of political power have done far more damage to the world than </i><br>
<i>&gt; people in positions of economic power,</i><br>
<p>
Political power has always gone hand in hand with economic power. It's <br>
impossible to divest the two. Even in the hallowed anarcho-capitalism, <br>
the wealth will come to accumulate in the hands of a few, so nothing will <br>
be accomplished without their permission. Pretty much a government, <br>
without the title.<br>
<p>
<p>
 and I don't understand how the <br>
<i>&gt; changes you are proposing could be carried out without entrusting </i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibility for the allocation of resources to politically powerful </i><br>
<i>&gt; (but presumably benevolent) individuals. Politically powerful individuals </i><br>
<i>&gt; have even less incentive to be sensitive to the desires of the less </i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful than wealthy individuals do. I'd be much more interested in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; programs you are outlining if you could explain to me how they might be </i><br>
<i>&gt; carried into practice by some means *other* than mandates and </i><br>
<i>&gt; prohibitions issued by committees of politically powerful individuals and </i><br>
<i>&gt; enforced at gunpoint. Because in these sorts of things, choice of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; right means is just as important to me as choice of the right ends. As </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ursula LeGuin quipped in THE DISPOSSESSED, the means are the end.</i><br>
<p>
Grassroots movement. No implementation from the elites, like traditional <br>
Marxist ideals. As power becomes more and more centralized, people are <br>
going to want change, but this will conflict with the interests of the <br>
power-holders, be they political or corporate. People still have some <br>
sort of power to affect their world without breaking out the shotguns. We <br>
need to act before even this is taken away from us.  No mandate from the <br>
politician will ever advocate getting rid of the politician, unless the <br>
people yell loud enough. I'm hoping this happens before any violence <br>
becomes a threat. <br>
<p>
With boycott power and tax revolt, we can still change the machine before <br>
it consumes us. <br>
