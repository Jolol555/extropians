        Even worse...will we be able to distinguish what is REALLY real from<br>
what is VIRTUALLY real?  Should VR even be classified as a form of reality?<br>
Talk about wheels within wheels; in this case it's *reals within reals!*<br>
I find this topic *very* intriguing.  If we lose grip with our reality, what<br>
do we have to hold on to then?<br>
<p>
        Once man enters a computer, he forfeits the life that he *knows* is<br>
real.  The false beauty of a virtual world can easily overwhelm any mortal<br>
(yes, we are all still mortal) person.  Once a person gets lost within all<br>
the colours of virtuality, would that person want to return to the more real<br>
world outside the computer's shell?  One trillion seperate hues in a virtual<br>
world are potentially far more beautiful than the ones that are found in the<br>
real world.<br>
<p>
        If a person were to get so wrapped up in virtuality that he forgot<br>
what reality truly was, who can save him?  He would be so accustomed to<br>
virtuality that reality would appear a vague semblance of what his virtual<br>
reality was.  To be taking a person who is accustomed to virtuality OUT of<br>
virtuality would be like putting a person accustomed to reality into the<br>
first dimension.  Horrific.<br>
<p>
        The scariest question of all is whether or not numbers can make a<br>
substantial reality.  Is virtual reality truly real?  If so, what exactly is<br>
the meaning of reality?  Can there be a bona fide existance within a<br>
5-cubic-foot encasement?  Can there be life within what another man created?<br>
*Should* there be life within what another man created?  Can it even be<br>
classified as life?<br>
<p>
        These are all very hypothetical, anthropological questions, but they<br>
are also very valid.  I've never been one to fear progress, but here's<br>
another question: is it progress?  Or is it regress?<br>
