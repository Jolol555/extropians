Robin Hanson wrote 9/29/96: &lt;I think the net is in great need of some innovate<br>
alternatives to the stark alternatives of open vs. moderated lists.  One idea<br>
I've played with is a list pair, one open and one closed (to posting, but<br>
readable by all).  To apply for membership in the closed list, you submit five<br>
of your recent posts to the open list, which are forwarded to three random<br>
closed list members for consideration.<br>
<p>
The personal filter concept that this list used to have doesn't work I<br>
think.  It is important to have a common sense of what some community<br>
is seeing.&gt;<br>
<p>
I've had an all-year discussion with an architect friend in a different Net<br>
forum about this need.  We are looking closely at the symbolism that ties a<br>
community together, as well as demarcation issues, that is, defense of the<br>
borders.  The necessity of hierarchical levels of authority lies behind the idea<br>
of a cyber-enclave with security provisions consisting of write with permission,<br>
read only - i.e., restricting ideas that come in, but not ideas that go out.<br>
This is how churches and peer reviews always have worked.  Those who grant<br>
permission of what ideas come in, are the authorities.  A twin pair of long-term<br>
difficulties with such a conception, is a nasty tendency towards authorities'<br>
hi-jacking of the good of all to their own good, and towards ideological<br>
smugness.  For example, physics journals continue to publish speculative<br>
theology, like the Big Bang doctrine, under the guise of scientific cosmology no<br>
matter how much it increasingly resembles the ad hoc construction of the<br>
Ptolemaic epicycles, to the exclusion of other, by definition, "crackpot"<br>
notions.<br>

Mark Crosby wrote 9/29/96: &lt;Far more fragile is the quality of civil discourse,<br>
which (IMO) Reilly Jones has more seriously violated with his slurs about<br>
"imbecility" and "conceptual drivel"...&gt;<br>
<p>
"Imbecility" should be generously regarded as applying to the qualities of that<br>
particular post, not the particular poster, and was used not as an ad hominem<br>
against any given argument, but rather as an explanation, involving a value<br>
judgment, as to why I wasn't going to respond at all.  The value judgment was<br>
intemperate, I "felt" intemperate when I made it.  I hope you are not<br>
invalidating my "feelings" or I might "feel" like you are being - horrors -<br>
intolerant of me.  "Conceptual drivel" is a slur when it is misapplied, not when<br>
it is factually applied.  Was there a violation of civil discourse?  Write to<br>
Miss Manners, c.o. your local rag, for a ruling.  I await her judgment.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;...and, less seriously, with his apparent notion that anyone who speaks<br>
must do so with 100% certainty.&gt;<br>
<p>
You may back this up with the appropriate quote from me, showing where I even<br>
remotely asserted this.  I don't recognize it in the slightest.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;I really hope we don't poison this list by classifying people as<br>
'nihilists' and 'imbeciles', nor condemn their ideas as 'conceptual drivel' just<br>
because their thinking may be 'muddled' in some areas, or their terms were<br>
ambiguous and their ideas may have been poorly presented.&gt;<br>
<p>
I attempt to classify individuals' belief systems with a modicum of care, with<br>
an eye to appropriateness.  Generally, posts stand on their own, beliefs stated<br>
in the post prompt classification.  It's a wonderful shorthand method to pull<br>
into context all the related beliefs that travel as worldview baggage along with<br>
a specific belief.  Otherwise, my posts would be many times longer than they<br>
already are, and that would violate net etiquette, which generally dictates that<br>
we think and write in choppy, disjointed paragraphs, rather than in extended,<br>
rich, contextual chains of reasoning.<br>
<p>
&lt;I ALSO REALLY HOPE THAT REILLY STICKS AROUND BECAUSE I THINK HE OFFERS ALOT OF<br>
USEFUL INSIGHTS, OFTEN FROM A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.&gt;<br>
<p>
This must be the carrot-and-stick approach.  My self-esteem just went from the<br>
cellar through the roof.  I'm giddy!<br>
<p>
&lt;When I said that Sarah's initial response to Reilly's initial post was<br>
"incisive", I meant two things simultaneously: (1) It really 'ripped' Reilly's<br>
post apart (perhaps a little too intensively, and he responded in kind); and,<br>
(2) It was sharp and to the point in some instances.&gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps I responded in kind, intensively, sharp and to the point.  I hope you're<br>
not making an argument for a double standard of posting style.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;I used "incisive" in an ambiguous way. Does that qualify my statement as<br>
'junk'? Should there be no subjectivity allowed on this list?&gt;<br>
<p>
Far be it from me to armchair psychoanalyze this.  I'll just take it as<br>
rhetorical filler.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;I am guilty of posting some 'junk' myself recently...&gt;<br>
<p>
I've heard that confession is good for the soul.  &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;Neither should every utterance need to be challenged - there should be some<br>
room for humor &amp; banter.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is why I didn't respond to Sarah's post to begin with.  I try to include<br>
some humor and banter routinely, some enjoy it, some don't.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;Jeff Dee thoughtfully wrote in response (that is, he made a constructive<br>
rather than destructive criticism)&gt;<br>
<p>
Tut, tut on me.  Maybe Jeff could give me some pointers.  Seriously, though, go<br>
back and read my posts, I have included a wealth of constructive ideas, and<br>
constructive sources to pursue.  If you only want to dwell on the negative,<br>
that's your perogative, but it doesn't make the positive nonexistent.<br>
<p>
MC: &lt;I'm also 'certain' that we can never be completely certain about most<br>
*things*, as opposed to *feelings*.  Is that a paradox or "conceptual drivel"?&gt;<br>
<p>
Neither, it looks like a true statement to me, particularly if you substitute<br>
"purposes" for "feelings."<br>
<p>
Michael Butler wrote 9/30/96: &lt;My major complaint is with people who repost vast<br>
quantities of prior text only to add a few lines of commentary.&gt;<br>
<p>
A pet peeve of mine also.<br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis wrote 9/30/96: &lt;I have resided on a list-within-list structure,<br>
but the inner list was by invitation only and required clearance by several<br>
inner list members.  The two lists dealt with a human rights issue, and the<br>
outer list occupied the harassers while the real work was conducted on the inner<br>
list, which could not be read by the outer list.  Eventually many persons on the<br>
inner list unsubbed from the outer list, considering it a distraction.&gt;<br>
<p>
A natural enough occurrence of self-selection, pull the drawbridge up.<br>
<p>
QueeneMUSE wrote 9/30/96: &lt;Especially helpful in that  one could judge the<br>
quality by one's sown criteria, not some removed committe or random selection of<br>
peers.... for example if it was starred by some one I really respect, i would<br>
tend to read that more than if someone starred it who i didnt.&gt;<br>
<p>
Again, a natural enough occurrence of self-selection, the road to celebrity<br>
endorsements.<br>
<p>
E. Shaun Russell wrote 9/30/96: &lt;Who's to say what is signal and what is noise?<br>
I think list members can filter the good from the bad on their own.&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree.  Like Barney the Dinosaur sings:  "Everyone is special."<br>
<p>
I still don't like humongous reposting of largely irrelevant text, followed by a<br>
two-line response.<br>
