I'm not talking about about confusing "paradoxes" like the twin paradox or<br>
the puzzles about observing ship clocks at relativistic speeds.  If you can<br>
get to your "absolute elsewhere" - the area of spacetime outside of your<br>
light cone, which would include both FTL and time travel - it's trivial to<br>
set up sequencing disagreements where some observers see one sequence of<br>
events in the same place, and others see others.  If some events make others<br>
impossible, you have a big problem.  My favorite example would be a spaceship<br>
FTLing into an incipient nova.  Some observers will see the ship fly into a<br>
nova and be destroyed.  Others see the ship fly through before the nova<br>
happens.  So when we have the Party at the End of the Galaxy, is the ship<br>
there or not?<br>
<p>
Traditional "paradoxes" show that something (apparently) impossible happens.<br>
 What happens is consistent with itself, just perhaps confusing to us.  FTL<br>
paradoxes can show that mutually incompatible things must happen together.<br>
 It's a much nastier paradox, because it shows internal inconsistency.<br>
