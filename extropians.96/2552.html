We've been discussing uploading and whether the upload is really the person <br>
who was uploaded, or whether they are some new person who only thinks they are <br>
the original person.<br>
<p>
First of all, if we're assuming that we can be uploaded into a computer in the <br>
first place, we are assuming that our consciousness is basically a type of <br>
computer program.  A computer program can be looked at as a way of <br>
transforming numbers into other numbers.  In the case of a person's <br>
consciousness running on a computer, the computer would be transforming a very <br>
LONG and complex number into another very long and complex number from moment <br>
to moment.  It doesn't matter how long the moments are in between <br>
transformations of the numbers that represent the process of someone's <br>
consciousness, it only matters that the same process is being carried out.  An <br>
interruption of a million years would make no difference to the upload, if <br>
they carry on then just as they were before.  The "stream of consciousness" <br>
doesn't have to be flowing all the time; it can stop and start, but as long as <br>
it always picks up right where it left off, it is still the same "stream of <br>
consciousness".  As long as uploading faithfully copies the computational <br>
process that is your consciousness, you will be uploaded AS you.  There may be <br>
disagreement about how accurately an uploading process can copy your <br>
consciousness however.  But as long as it doesn't alter it any more than it <br>
typically gets altered in the normal course of events, I see no way to argue <br>
that the upload isn't as really you as you are.  But, we'll just have to wait <br>
around and see how good the technology is (of course, those of us who are <br>
interested should actually get out and work on this technology, rather than <br>
sitting around waiting for someone else to do it).<br>
