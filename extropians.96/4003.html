I recently purchased Rush's "Chronicles" compilation after years of <br>
casual interset reached critical mass.  I was pleased to find that for <br>
the most part my interest was justified, and my intitiative rewarded with <br>
with expertly crafted music.  The later tracks on disc two become, well, <br>
cheesey and lose their appeal.  But over all its a good show.  I <br>
especially like "Freewill," "Tom Sawyer.," "New World Man has, IMO,  <br>
catiously optimistic overtones about technology and those who wield it-- <br>
proto-exptropian themes are always a plus!  "Bluring the line between <br>
Machine and Man" is my favorite line.<br>
<p>
I too have a muscical interst that sparked what eventually evolved into my <br>
affinity for extropian philosophy: Gary Numan.  Remember "Cars?"  I was <br>
about 9 when that song hit the US.  I probaly heard it on the radio five <br>
times when it was new, then nothing until I found a used compilation ten <br>
years later.  I instantly loved it, but it was a year or two before it <br>
really sank in.  I wouldn't call Gary Numan's music extropic. In fact <br>
some of it is down right emotionally destructive, and much of his <br>
references to technology deal with its supposed alienating effects.  <br>
<p>
However, ther are exceptions to that rule, particularly some <br>
instrumentals that are quite beatiful, with moogs in full effect.  He <br>
also employs some fretless bass at times that is quite captivating.  <br>
<p>
What Numan's music did for me is to intiate a intra-personal dialogue <br>
about technology and human evolution that eventually lead me to this <br>
list.  One song in particular, "I Dream of Wires," was instrumental in <br>
focusing my thoughts on Mankind's relationship with technology.  I <br>
really don't know what Gary meant by:<br>
<p>
"I am the final silence<br>
 The last electrician alive<br>
 They called me 'the sparkle'<br>
 I was the best, I worked them all<br>
 <br>
"We opened doors by thinking<br>
 We went to sleep by dialing 'O'<br>
 We drove to work by proxy<br>
 I plugged my wife in, just for show...<br>
<p>
 So I press "C" for comfort<br>
 I dream of wires, the old days<br>
<p>
 New ways, new ways<br>
 I dream of wires"<br>
<p>
Apparently, some future past is better than the coresponding future <br>
present.  <br>
<p>
I don't share many of Gary's ideas that I'm actully able to decifer, <br>
but he still makes (made) beautiful sounds, and more importantly <br>
they have lead me through an epic doorway in my own thinking.<br>
<p>
Any other Numanoids out there, past or present?.  As far as I know, I'm <br>
the only person in North America who is aware of anything other than <br>
'Cars.'     <br>
