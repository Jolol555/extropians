          But this is not an academic journal, this is a mailing list <br>
          for all sorts of people interested in transhumanism. We do <br>
          not only discuss scientific questions, but also art, values, <br>
          contemporary &gt;H events etc. etc. The very diversity of the <br>
          contributors adds to the fascination of the extropian and &gt;H <br>
          mailing lists. (And by the way, Niklas, you don't read most <br>
          peoples messages, so what could you know!)<br>

          <br>
          I would make that "top 5%". Haven't you seen enough <br>
          academics to realise how many narrow-minded fools there are <br>
          at the universities. Even if we could persuade them that <br>
          radical future technologies are worth thinking about, do you <br>
          really believe that a person who need to be _persuaded_ <br>
          about that could have a significant capacity of judgement <br>
          and would be able to contribute original ideas to the <br>
          discussion of fundamental transhumanist issues?<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          Well, it gives us a justification for trying to spread our <br>
          views. And for this we will need all our energy and <br>
          enterprising drive, all the multifarious skills of the <br>
          various persons on these lists. In truth, I tell you: the <br>
          transhumanist movement is a boiling kettle, and amongst the <br>
          steams I discern the shapes of a mighty spirit in the <br>
          process of formation, an idea whose time has come...<br>
