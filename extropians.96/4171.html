Eleizer Yudkowsky has suggested that it would be wrong to kill a sentient <br>
being, such as a human, but it is okay to kill a non-sentient being, such as a <br>
cow.  Many people feel this way.  But what is so special about sentient beings <br>
that it is "wrong" to kill them?  Considering the view that uploading is <br>
possible because sentient beings are basically certain types of highly complex <br>
computer programs, why is it any more "wrong" to terminate a sentient program <br>
than it is to exit Windows?  Does the program gain any sort of mystical <br>
"life-force" when it becomes 'sentient'?  <br>
<p>
According to one of my most persuasive currently active belief systems, <br>
'sentience' is a particular quality that physical systems may exhibit, if they <br>
are arranged in a certain way, sort of like a crystalline structure is one <br>
quality physical systems may exhibit when arranged the right ways.  I don't <br>
know much about the details of sentience, but from an objective point of view, <br>
I don't see why it is "wrong" to terminate sentient systems.  <br>
<p>
However, being a sentient system myself, I have a certain affection for <br>
sentient systems in general, but I think this comes from my instincts for <br>
self-preservation, a desire which also extends to anything sufficiently <br>
similar to myself.  So, I certainly don't advocate terminating sentient <br>
systems; in fact, I want to do all I can to help them become even *more* <br>
sentient.<br>
<p>
I am thinking that nothing is objectively "good" or "bad", but that these <br>
words are really used to indicate whether something is helping or hindering <br>
the achievement of our goals.  If we like something, we say it is "good", and <br>
if we don't like something, we say it is "bad".  It seems like it's basically <br>
a matter of personal taste.  <br>
<p>
However, I am a person who identifies easily with others, who automatically <br>
internalizes other beings in my mind and feels a great deal of empathy for <br>
others, and because I do this, it really upsets me when I am aware that others <br>
are suffering.  My system of ethics is entirely selfish, based only on my <br>
personal desires, but because I have the habit of identifying myself with <br>
others and because I have a difficult time making a clear distinction between <br>
myself and my internal models of other people, my system of ethics also drives <br>
me to work for what I consider to be the well-being of others.  I also <br>
identify easily with certain kinds of animals, especially mammals, and it is <br>
upsetting to me when I imagine certain types of animals experiencing anything <br>
too unpleasant.  That is why I don't eat certain types of animals.  I do eat <br>
sea food, however.  When I imagine being a fish or a clam or something like <br>
that, it doesn't feel like there's much of a capacity for suffering, so eating <br>
them doesn't cause me any discomfort.<br>
<p>
Of course, I'm aware that my discomfort in eating certain animals is <br>
completely self-generated, but that doesn't make it any less uncomfortable.  <br>
The discomfort I feel when I consider harming myself or members of my family <br>
is also completely self-generated, but knowing that doesn't make the thought <br>
any less disturbing.<br>
