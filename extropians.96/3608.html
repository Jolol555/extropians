<i>&gt;While Greenpeace is nowadays doing PR mostly, &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>

Don't know what the press coverage is like in your country, but in <br>
Washington, where direct action is a spectator sport, we've heard <br>
plenty regarding Greenpeace's recent activities.  Several months ago <br>
they pulled their most difficult stunt ever, dropping a man onto an <br>
oil rig that was scheduled for demolition.  They led the coalition <br>
protesting the French nuclear testing, and almost had several of <br>
their boats blown out of the water by the French Navy.  They also led <br>
related protests also took place against the Mexican government.<br>
<p>
Just one of those projects would have occupied your average activist <br>
group for a year, but it's an indication of how highly trained and <br>
dedicated they are.  I got some of my original direct action training <br>
through one of their people, and it was an intense experience.  <br>
Knowing this, their shift in emphasis against technological advancement <br>
becomes worrisome.<br>
