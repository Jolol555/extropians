In an evolutionary sense, probably. But already sex is used mostly for<br>
pleasure and self-expression, not procreation. Making a universal statement<br>
like "sex is obsolete" requires you to make more of an argument. Why should<br>
everyone stop having sex (in whatever future form) just because *you* don't<br>
see it as worthwhile in your future life? Would you do away with all other<br>
pleasurable and expressive activities if they are not tied to survival or<br>
material gain (if these are the values you see as central for uploads)?<br>
<p>
Rather than saying "sex is obsolete" in the changed conditions of the<br>
future, I think it more reasonable to say that sex will be optional. We will<br>
be able to choose whether, when, how much, and with regard to who/what we<br>
feel sexual urges. Becoming posthuman to me means not abolishing everything<br>
about being human (though somethings may be good to abolish) but making them<br>
a matter of choice, and being able to refine them.<br>
