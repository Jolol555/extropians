I think some of the posts on the meaning of TANSTAAFL are very good, but<br>
some of them seem to be missing Heinlein's point.  I think he meant that --<br>
one way or another:<br>
<p>
 - Everything is caused by a reason<br>
 - Everything is paid for by someone<br>
 - Everything has a cost<br>
 - For every action there is an equal -- but opposite -- reaction<br>
 - A free lunch is still paid for by someone<br>
 - If you think health care is expensive now, wait till it's free (PJ O'Rourke)<br>
<p>
Or as Neil Peart said: <br>
<p>
"You don't get something for nothing / You can't have freedom for free<br>
You won't get wise / With the sleep still in your eyes<br>
No matter what your dreams might be . . .<br>
What you own is your own kingdom / What you do is your own glory<br>
What you love is your own power / What you live is your own story<br>
In your head is the answer / Let it guide you along<br>
Let your heart be the anchor / And the beat of your own song"<br>
<p>
--Lyrics by Neil Peart *Something for Nothing* (Rush "2112")<br>
