Why is this mailinglist SOOOOO focused on uploading? There are *MANY* other<br>
extropian subjects but uploading seems to get most of the attention. What if<br>
perhaps uploading fails? We should have a whole set of other methods we can<br>
use to back it up just in case. Numero uno rule: Always have a plan B, C, D,<br>
etc. For example, what about studying those children who suffer from rapid<br>
aging to learn if the genes altered in these children control the rate of<br>
aging and how we can change these in ourselves to counter the effects of<br>
aging and potentially extend our lives hundreds of years. We should focus on<br>
topics such as these as well so that if uploading fails to become a reality<br>
we will still have an immediate backup we can fall back upon without having<br>
to start discussion all over again for a different process.<br>
