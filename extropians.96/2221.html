refine new extropian ideas."<br>
<p>
Chris, engineers ARE artists.  They are artists who love great precision in <br>
their work.  They design their machines and structures according to their own <br>
aesthetic parameters, to fulfill certain functions. <br>
<p>
The left-brain / right-brain duality is innappropriate, really.  Each side of <br>
our brains has it's own things that it's more specialized to do, but for most, <br>
if not all tasks, both sides of the brain are active.  Splitting apart left <br>
and right sides of the brain or separating intuition and logic are <br>
innappropriate, because that's not the way things really are.  Our intuition <br>
is a type of logic for dealing with incompete data and finding likely <br>
connections between the data and making reasonable inferrences from incomplete <br>
data.  More formal logic is mainly a matter of following the rules of the <br>
game, and the games of formal logic were created, based on people's intuition <br>
of how things work and what is reasonable.<br>
<p>
There is no dichotomy between {creativity, intuition and art} and {logic and <br>
engineering}.  Logic is a form of art, an expression of people's values, an <br>
expression of themselves.  Logic is a more refined and narrow form of <br>
intuition, used for dealing with more complete sets of data. <br>
<p>
Logic and engineering are particular types of art, just as painting and <br>
sculpting are.  Everything humans do is a type of art (some more refined, to <br>
my taste, than others).<br>
<p>
You see, Chris, I am someone who has a great interest in creating things in <br>
many areas of art, icluding mechanical engineering, graphic arts, computer <br>
science, music, philosophy, drama,  mathematics, writing and physics.  So I <br>
wouldn't fit anywhere in your classification scheme of 'artists' vs. <br>
'engineers'.  I am both.  I want to express my personal values and desires <br>
through many different media and through many different modes of thinking.  <br>
Sometimes I like to express my values through music, sometimes through <br>
writing, sometimes through sculpture, sometimes through mathematics, sometimes <br>
through philosophy, and there are many other forms of expression that I enjoy <br>
engaging in.  Many dichotomies that people make are inappropriate to make <br>
because they don't respect the real state of things, and I think the <br>
left-brain vs. right-brain dichotomy is inappropriate.<br>
