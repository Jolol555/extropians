I have found these types of curves interesting as well, though I don't think<br>
they are necessarily unextropian. I can envision a series of such curves in<br>
succession. As the growth in one curve starts leveling off, new processes<br>
(which I think can be viewed as extropian - BE, ST, IT ) take over and start<br>
a new curve. I can also see the time interval required to complete a new<br>
curve sequence possibly getting shorter and shorter. Speculation: perhaps<br>
the rate of the shortening of the time interval would also follow such a<br>
curve (a fractal-like relationship)?<br>
<p>
I think this type of growth curve can be applied to increases in population<br>
or wealth. Most of what I would consider credible estimates of future world<br>
population predict a stabilization somewhere in the 10 to 15 billion range.<br>
This would make a curve like the one mentioned. I can also see more similar<br>
shaped curves taking off from the previous one with the colonization of the<br>
rest of the solar system, neighboring systems, etc.<br>

A friend of one of my co-workers is a designer at Intel. The computer he<br>
works on has about 2GB! of RAM, which is what's needed to simulate the<br>
activity of all the individual transitors on the next generations of chips.<br>
