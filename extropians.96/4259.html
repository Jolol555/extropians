That is the way the evolution of language generally works, in the long<br>
run.<br>

Doesn't the Institute run this list? Isn't engaging in discussion of <br>
extropian topics on a list sponsored by the Institute "working with the <br>
Institute in a positive way"? I do not understand why discussions of the<br>
usage of words need to be conducted in private.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't really think that anyone could call a proposed description<br>
of extropy as "the quality of creative order characteristic of<br>
living systems" a "redefinition". It just seems to me to be a good<br>
alternative way of getting across the same sorts of ideas we have<br>
been talking about all along. Extropy is a big word, and big words<br>
cannot be summed up by single definitions that stand for all time.<br>
I also am having a hard time thinking of any specific reasons why<br>
anyone would want to object to describing extropy as the quality<br>
of creative order characteristic of living systems. Is there<br>
something left out of this phrase? Or something implied that we<br>
don't really mean? I think everyone on this list realizes that<br>
human technology, and not only biological systems, is already<br>
beginning to display (in its own right) the quality of creative<br>
order characteristic of living systems.<br>
