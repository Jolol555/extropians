To repeat it for the umpteenth time: there is nothing intrinsically holy <br>
or beautiful in the act of sex. It's in the eye of the observer, entirely. <br>
Sex is an artefact of evolution, tailored to fulfill its range of tasks <br>
(mostly, autoreplication) it was designed to do. Period. <br>
<p>
Once the entire background situation changes qualitatively, sex is obsolete.<br>
<p>
Trying to perpetuate sex, particularly to drag along sex in an upload <br>
mind ecology all the way up to Omega, is, sorry to say it, simply <br>
ludicrous.<br>
<p>
(Caveat: An upload universe, unless unlimited-resource, will have <br>
darwinian evolution, will have death, and ergo, probably autoreplication. <br>
If the entire persona bandwidth is present, from the virus to god <br>
equivalent, some species will probably have some coitus procedure (unless <br>
there are no distinct personae, nor timespace as we know it, that is)).<br>
