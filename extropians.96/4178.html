<i>&gt;Are chain letters somehow worse than other junk mail?</i><br>
<p>
Oh no! Mail discrimination! Call the ACLU!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I ask the above questions not to be inflammatory, but out of a sincere</i><br>
<i>&gt;desire to understand. I have run into quite a few people on the net who</i><br>
<i>&gt;share your view of chain mail. I myself am annoyed by _junk mail_. I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;equally annoyed by anything which wastes my time. But I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;specifically target chain letters for my wrath. On the contrary, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;replication processes by which chain letters survive almost guarantees</i><br>
<i>&gt;that any which I might receive will be of interest to me. Something in</i><br>
<i>&gt;their content has made them work as memetic viruses, and finding out</i><br>
<i>&gt;just what that something is interests me greatly. Likewise, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested in what I perceive to be a growing immunity to them as</i><br>
<i>&gt;expressed by the feelings of yourself and others.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps we should study and pick apart a few chain letters to findout what<br>
makes them tick and along with analyzing religions, and other strong memes<br>
to eventually create a meme toolkit or set of defined guidelines so that we<br>
can begin creating a super-contagious extropian meme.<br>
