                <br>
<p>
A few things are free now, like water from a public water fountain. Of course  <br>
the water is not really free, it's just too cheap to be worth the bother of <br>
charging for it.    <br>

<i>                &gt;mahogany wood, orchids, or caviar?  Products made atom by                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;atom in a replicating system may be very expensive.   </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Silk is expensive because if the price was any lower then the demand would <br>
outstrip the supply. The reason silk supply is limited is because the silk <br>
worm is lousy at producing silk. The silk worm was not designed, it evolved <br>
in a mindless process, and evolution did not optimize it to produce silk, <br>
it optimized it to pass on silk worm genes to the next generation. The silk<br>
worm can not reproduce itself in just any simple environment, only in a very <br>
specific,  very  complex one. The plants the silk worm eats were not optimized <br>
to produce tasty food for this bug, in fact evolution tried, not entirely <br>
successfully, to move in the exact opposite direction.<br>
<p>
Potatoes are made of the same atoms as silk, and potatoes are undoubtedly more <br>
complex than silk, the reason silk is more expensive is pure chance. Part of <br>
the evolutionary strategy that potato plant genes use to reproduce themselves <br>
include the production of a large amount of potatoes, so they must be pretty<br>
efficient at it, silk worm genes only need a tiny amount of silk to reproduce  <br>
themselves. If the history of life had been slightly different it could have <br>
easily been the other way around, silk could have been cheap as dirt and  <br>
potatoes a very expensive gourmet food.<br>
                <br>
The reason diamonds are expensive is that they don't grow on trees, and the  <br>
reason they don't is that life is incapable of constructing the tools to make  <br>
them from the simple carbon in CO2. Life is a nanotechnology, sort of, but <br>
it's a very primitive, very stupid sort of one. It's not surprising that life  <br>
is dumb, considering that the processes that made it had no mind at all, just  <br>
random mutation and natural selection. It's not surprising that life is crude,  <br>
considering its basic building block is not the atom at all but something  <br>
much larger, the amino acid, and not even all of them, only 20 out of <br>
thousands. Any machine life wants to make must be constructed from those 20  <br>
amino acids, a severe limitation for even the best designer and if the <br>
"designer" has not a particle of intelligence, a crippling one. It's no <br>
wonder it took the evolution of amino acid structures almost 4 billion years  <br>
to come up with us. I don't know how long it will take for us to develop <br>
Nanotechnology but I know if will be A LOT less than 4 billion years because <br>
people are A LOT smarter than a cosmic ray that causes a random mutation in <br>
some DNA.           <br>
                                            <br>

<i>                &gt;Put nanotechnology into a historical context.  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I'd love to, but I don't know how. None of our previous technological <br>
advances improved us, they improved our tools, in the singularity we become <br>
our tools and that is fundamentally new. That's why it's called a <br>
"Singularity", there  is nothing else like it.<br>
 <br>
OK, if you put a gun to my head and asked me for a historic parallel I <br>
suppose  I'd say The Cambrian Explosion 570 million years ago. In less than <br>
10 million years, probably much less, nearly all the 32 phyla that make up <br>
life today,  and some that no longer exist, got their start. Nobody knows why <br>
things happened so suddenly but I think there must have been some bio chemical  <br>
problem ( the need for efficient calcification? ) that was holding back  <br>
progress, when nature finally solved the problem through trail and error there <br>
was an unprecedented explosion of creativity and experimentation. <br>
                     <br>
One of the animals that evolved during this time was a dull looking little <br>
worm  like animal called "Pikaia". Pikaia was a chordate,  a member of our <br>
own phyla and the ancestor of every vertebrate animal on earth including us. <br>
I don't think anybody could have predicted all the mischief this critter would <br>
cause in the coming years. Predicting is hard, especially the future. (:&gt;) <br>
<p>
This may not be a singularity but it's the best I  could come up with.     <br>

<i>                &gt;If a genie machine is defined as an entity that can make                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;anything --  whatever it is told to make -- does a genie                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;machine already exist? I  would say yes:  the economy as a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;whole is a genie machine.  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
People have been giving orders to that particular "genie machine" for a long <br>
time namely "make me rich". The results have been mixed.  It's true that even  <br>
the poorest member of this list is fabulously wealthy compared to the average <br>
person of 2 centuries ago (a long time in human terms), it's also true that<br>
even the richest member of this list is not nearly as rich as he wants to be.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Now, could anything smaller than the entire economy make                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;*anything*?                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, much, much smaller.<br>
