            Morning Light<br>
<p>
<p>
Morning light, my morning light,<br>
  Slips slow over my love,<br>
And clothes her in gossamer.<br>
<p>
          And turning now, she whispers,<br>
            Words of my creation,<br>
          But still I cannot hear them.<br>
<p>
<p>
In her rebirth I saw hope,<br>
  I saw her phoenix rise,<br>
Felt her sun-warm fire once more.<br>
<p>
          And sighing now, she slumbers,<br>
            Through dreams of my doing,<br>
          But still I cannot shape them.<br>
<p>
<p>
In her rebirth I found warmth,<br>
  I found her company,<br>
Reclaimed what Death had taken.<br>
<p>
          And dreaming now, she wonders,<br>
            "Why does she love me so?"<br>
          But still I cannot tell her.<br>
<p>
<p>
In her rebirth I found pain,<br>
  I found her memory,<br>
Saw lost truth behind old lies.<br>
<p>
          And worried now, she questions,<br>
            "Where is the past I had?"<br>
          But still I cannot answer.<br>
<p>
<p>
In her rebirth I found grief,<br>
  I found her destiny,<br>
Believed in her wish to leave.<br>
<p>
          And stirring now, she forgets.<br>
            "I am with my true love."<br>
          But still I cannot hold her.<br>
<p>
<p>
In her rebirth I found light,<br>
  Yet lost it in darkness,<br>
That drowned her within my soul.<br>
<p>
          And waking now, she rises,<br>
            And letting go my dream,<br>
          I watch as she slowly fades.<br>
<p>
<p>
Morning light, my morning light,<br>
  Slips slow over my mind;<br>
Clothes my loss in memory.<br>
<p>
<p>
                                 Sarah Marr<br>
