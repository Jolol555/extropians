[Suresh Naidu] <br>
<i>&gt; a statistic I heard was that 358 people controlled 45% of the worlds</i><br>
wealth.<br>
[Mitch]<br>
This is surely a mutated version of a statement from the 1996 Human<br>
Development Report(snip)<br>
"According to the Human Development Report 1996, the net worth of the358<br>
richest people - _Forbes Magazine_ of the US puts the number at447 dollar<br>
billionaires - is equal to the combined income of the poorest 45 per cent of<br>
the world population, that is 2.3 billion people."(snip)<br>
_West Africa_ lists global GDP for 1993 as $23 trillion. $447 billionis just<br>
under 2% of that, so perhaps we can say that all those billionaires control<br>
at least 1% of the world's wealth.<br>
<p>

Saresh, in an earlier post you said that there was<br>
 more than enough to go around, now you've said <br>
the opposite. : - )<br>
       Mitch thanx for the stats.<br>
<p>
I, unlike John Clark, think that there proabably *is*<br>
more than enough  resource on earth to give most of <br>
us (those willing to work for it) a decent living.  Also, <br>
I would be happy to help you build your house, if you <br>
help me build mine (I probably won't be as tired as John because a lot of<br>
friends will have helped me : )<br>
       As illustrated above, it is getting more and more <br>
easy to make a lot of money, and with money comes the <br>
ability to change things, really change them, not yak<br>
about it. That was what the Million Man March was about, raising money!<br>
 Fine. Poor people need money. But do<br>
 they need *your* moeny? My money? Bill Gates' <br>
money? : - ) No, they need thier own money. That is true empowerment.<br>
I disagree that  individualism means we won't <br>
have community and  social (not socialist) programs<br>
and organized task forces.  People, by and large, (with occasional<br>
exceptions) are social animals. Even Extropians have parties.<br>
You can expect some people to help other people. The difference is can you<br>
FORCE people to help other people.<br>
 I understand your concern for the people who aren't so fortunate, and also<br>
have compassion and doubts.<br>
I have often argued that Libertarians advocate tough <br>
love, but with out the LOVE &gt; :  )<br>
<p>
Maybe some training systems or money and tools to <br>
segue "laggards" into anarchy or Tony Robbins "How to <br>
Get People Motivated to become Billionaires Once they <br>
Cut Welfare" seminars are necessary before this thing<br>
 will fly.<br>
<p>
Even if there is plenty of resource on this planet, how<br>
 can you make people *want* to work for them? <br>
