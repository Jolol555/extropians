<i>&gt; Hmmm... Something isn't consistent here.  If there was an explosion, it</i><br>

<i>&gt; of an organic fuel.  It was probably a mostly exothermic explosion (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposed to deflagration or detonation).</i><br>
<p>
The mixture was enclosed in the shell of a coconut. Maybe some kind of <br>
reaction occured between the organic shell and the mixture (the very hot <br>
high-oxygen mixture that the initial ignition resulted in ought to do <br>
something interesting to cellulose).<br>
<p>
An interesting possibility is to use cesium salts, which shifts down the <br>
spectrum, to move more radiation into the infrared. I think we tried it <br>
together with magnesium, but had no clear results.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Which leads me to question the one meter wide crater.  Unless the charge was</i><br>
<i>&gt; buried, this number is *way* too large.  Using military explosives, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; would require a block of TNT, which has an order of magnitude more power</i><br>
<i>&gt; than potassium chlorate under the best of circumstances.  The crater may</i><br>
<i>&gt; have seemed large at the time, though.  Either that or there was *a lot*</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than a couple spoonfuls of the chlorate mixture.  What kind of depth</i><br>
<i>&gt; did you get?</i><br>
<p>
Only a centimeter or so... so the charge wasn't that military grade. But<br>
there is a real possibility of a larger charge since Ingvar, the warped<br>
mind behind actually *doing* the experiment, may have gone against my<br>
advise of a small amount. He also created a far too large batch of <br>
nitrogen tri-iodide that nobody dared to move from the lab. Now he is as <br>
far as I know studying moral philosophy and computer science.<br>
