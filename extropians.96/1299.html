Okay I don`t really see this. Are you referring to the welfare state? If <br>
so, I disagree vehemently. Very few people are "loafers". There are some, <br>
but most people I know on welfare are doing everything in their power to get <br>
out. Those few that do leech off the system shouldn`t be the reason for <br>
letting those that need it starve.<br>
I hate and fear government as much as anyone, but I also fear corporate <br>
tyranny, and as long as private interests are this selfish and greedy, I <br>
will pay my taxes to help out my fellow man.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; want to do that?  Point being, they'd just </i><br>
keep breeding &gt; &gt; without foresight until they surpassed all the carrying<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capacity of the planet.</i><br>
No they wouldn`t, because the disparity in economics would eventually <br>
become so magnified these disenfranchised people would either die off, <br>
or get Marxist. If the power imbalance is enough, the "productive <br>
people", will have sufficient firepower to suppress any rallying effort <br>
by the masses.    <br>
<i>&gt; Back to basics, folks. Every country which has a good standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; living, where survival in one's old age is not dependent on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; number of one's offspring, has had a slowing of population growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the USA, we would see a population decrease if there were no</i><br>
<i>&gt; immigration.</i><br>
We would we a population increase rate decrease, but the actual <br>
population will still increase.<br>
 If the Extropian vision is a positive one, the goal will<br>
<i>&gt; be increased quality of life for one's children, which will always</i><br>
<i>&gt; be costly, and increasingly so.</i><br>
I hope this is available to everyone, though. I think a rwandan farmer <br>
should have the same opportunity to become a nanogod as the CEO of some <br>
big company. I realize I`ve probably contradicted many extropian <br>
political opinions, but I do embrace the hope for technological <br>
advancement helping out all of humanity instead of just the rich.  <br>
