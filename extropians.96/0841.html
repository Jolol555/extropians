<p>
My feeling is that spculation by humans about the motivations and<br>
actions<br>
of an SI (AI or any other type) is not worthwhile. It's equivalent to<br>
ants speculating about humans, or humans speculating about God.<br>
<p>
So, on to the worthless speculation! An SI has no reason to deliver an<br>
ultimatum. the SI can simply take human civilization and modify it at<br>
the optimal rate consistent with the SI's (incomprehensible) goals.<br>
For example, let's arbitrarily assume that the SI has determined that<br>
revealing itself to  humanity will slow our "progress" toward whatever<br>
its goal for us is, but, being a benign being, the SI wants to stop<br>
wars.<br>
In this (arbitrary) scenario, the SI cannot instantly stop all wars<br>
without<br>
revealing itself, but it might guide humanity to prevent big wars and<br>
minimize small ones. I think your "one week" ultimatum is unlikely. The<br>
SI simply take control of the bodies of anybody that breaks the SI's<br>
rules, without even letting them know.<br>
<p>
Basically I don't believe that SIs that are only somewhat more<br>
intelligent<br>
than humans will exist, except very transiently, because an SI that's<br>
only<br>
somewhat more intelligent than a smart human can make itself smarter<br>
still. This feedback mechanism has no obvous limit until the SI has<br>
godlike powers, and the transformation will occur in days or weeks.<br>
