        I apologize if my response was a little misleading.  *Physically*<br>
another billion (indeed another three) would be comfortable, but when you<br>
take into consideration the strong belief systems of the predominant portion<br>
of that billion AND the potential for more children, that is uncomfortable<br>
to me.  Look at the current skirmishing in the middle-East!<br>
<p>
        The fact that North America will reach the ZPG level within a<br>
relatively short time is slightly encouraging...but not as encouraging than<br>
if we had lots more room to roam.  As for planet emigration being a<br>
solution, I think it would be.  Mainly because of the potential it creates;<br>
think: if we can make it to one planet, what prevents us from making it to<br>
another?  And given the knowledge that scientific progress is constantly<br>
being made (in some way or another), I'm optimistic about inhabiting planets<br>
before Earth reaches the *physically* uncomfortable level.<br>

        Au contraire, mon bien amis.  The world's resources are limited.<br>
More people *anywhere* means quicker diminishing of oxygen, wood, water,<br>
etc. Everyone's affected.  Best to extrope as soon as possible!<br>
