<i>&gt;&gt;The other thing that perhaps should be said is that to point a finger</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;at the non-human part of transhumans (frown implied) is rather speciest,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;or at least indicates some intolerance for those transcending their human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;limits.  That sits very poorly alongside the self-transformation and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;acceptance of diversity that is at the very heart of transhumanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I disagree strongly but I think the use of the word "human" is a large</i><br>
<i>&gt;part of the problem.  You are using it in a sort of clinical, species-</i><br>
<i>&gt;identifying way, where banjo is using it to mean the *best* qualities</i><br>
<i>&gt;of humans.  I strongly don't want to live with extra-clever beings who</i><br>
<i>&gt;have *rejected* what I consider the most important parts of humanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I may "tolerate" them, in a wary way, if that day comes, but until then</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll try hard to convince people not to create them or become them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is the main reason I'm an extropian: because the point is not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;to celebrate change, any old change, but to try to make change for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;better rather than the worse.  Extropy rather than entropy.</i><br>
<p>
In all cases, i assumed extropianism and transhumanism imply that the<br>
individual should decide . I assume everybody tolerates prothesis for<br>
medical reasons. What if there are people who will tell you, they view a<br>
'human' quality, you happen to value very highly as a personal  'disability'<br>
? Have you tried looking at it this way ? If we are intollerant to<br>
eachothers goals and motives, then what are our hopes for expecting<br>
tollerance from the rest of the world ? <br>

<p>
There should be room for 'sub' groups within the extropian movement. For<br>
quite some time in the future,  we will share similar goals, at least up to<br>
a certain level. Anyone is free to leave whenever they feel their 'prefered'<br>
level has been reached, or when Extropy's goals are more 'specifically'<br>
defined whenever a new technology it strives to promote, becomes available.<br>
Let's save our arguments for a time when that moment draws closer. Extropy<br>
institute setting 'limits' this early, will IMHO only push people away from<br>
it.  <br>
<p>
I'm new to Etropy, and i admit one of my points for hesitating, were exactly<br>
those seemingly 'vague' limits and goals, but only within Extropy, did i<br>
find individuals who share my views. As long as there is no other major<br>
group that deals with these memes, i think allowing room for variety in<br>
these goals may be the best solution for now.    <br>

<p>
again those human 'qualities' people value enough for them to make up the<br>
'core or essence' of humanity, will vary greatly from person to person. One<br>
will put great emphasis on keeping some of their physical/mental qualities,<br>
another will put the emphasis on hanging on to completely different physical<br>
or mental qualities. I think you will find that most will not view, that<br>
which they intend to change, as 'losing' something, at all, but as an<br>
improvement or an addition, even though others might regard it as a loss of<br>
'humanity'. If your intention is to not change anything at all, that's fine,<br>
but trying to push your views, of what you think should be the core or<br>
essence of humanity, on other people, is a scary thought...     <br>
<p>
I think the non-humans in this group may have replaced the word 'humanity'<br>
with something beyond that, but i'm sure they realize the 'heritage' of<br>
their intended creation, the product of which, will always keep some 'human'<br>
element. So i think the same goes for them.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And I wouldn't want to.  What I meant was, if "extropy" means anything to</i><br>
<i>&gt;me at all, it's the idea of actively pushing for a better future--which</i><br>
<i>&gt;requires getting over apologizing for one's particular values--rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;passively accepting whatever happens, or trying to join the winning team</i><br>
<i>&gt;by philosophizing in its favor.  People actually slip into a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;gung-ho fatalism on this list sometimes: if the XX are coming and we can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;beat 'em, then join em.  Well, not so fast, boys.</i><br>
<p>
Again, who's better future ? At the moment, only very few of the means we're<br>
discussing for change, are actually available for use. If we intend to get<br>
these options to become available, we need cooperation and open mindedness<br>
to eachothers needs, not extrapolation of groups into fundamentalist<br>
behaviour. I agree with viewing Extropy as a tool, not a religion. Keeping<br>
the rationality to a maximum, saving the ethical judgements for the moment<br>
when we personally need it, to actually face the problem. <br>
<p>
I'd like to repeat the question asked before, for a more clear vision of<br>
what your 'better' future would look like. I think most people in this group<br>
are open minded towards the future in general, and realize that there is<br>
more than one way to acchieve their personal 'better' future. <br>
<p>
Do you ?   <br>
