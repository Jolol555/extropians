"Why we get sick:  The new science of Darwinian medicine."<br>
Randolph Nesse, M.D. and George Williams, Ph.D.<br>
<p>
Answers most of your questions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose Keyes had allowed Charlie to find a permanent fix to his</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterioration. After all,  medicos have come up with fairly good kludges for</i><br>
<i>&gt; tissue rejection.  The story would then not have been a tragedy, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would not have made us cry, and while that would have been a Good Thing on</i><br>
<i>&gt; an extropian analysis (I take it) it wouldn't have made the story famous</i><br>
<i>&gt; either.  </i><br>
<p>
Maybe I'll email Keyes and ask him whether Algernon's Law ever occurred<br>
to him.  In any case, Charlie might have been shown as deducing his doom<br>
from first principles before Algernon went bad.  This might allow a<br>
thrill of hope followed by crushing despair, and would have enhanced the<br>
reader's perception of Charlie as a genius.  Knowing Algernon's Law<br>
implies not a fix, as I know to my sorrow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How do we know that (to take an extreme case) a point mutation doubling the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of neurons in the cortex might not massively benefit its bearer?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Because it hasn't happened, or if it has happened has proved a hindrance?</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's what Lucy would have predicted, the pea-brain.  I wonder if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bottleneck (sic), as is generally supposed, has until now been the</i><br>
<i>&gt; limitation on pelvic size in mothers &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Didn't I say exactly that in "Algernon's Law"?  I think it was in the<br>
footnotes.<br>
<p>
Algernon's Law, like most of the Universe, is not absolute.  There will<br>
be minor counterexamples.  My main point was that you couldn't expect to<br>
stick an electrode into the brain and get a Power, and you had to work<br>
out the disadvantages in cognitive terms.<br>
<p>
Remember:  "A *practical* guide ... using *modern* technology."<br>
Not "A flawless theoretical discussion covering all possibilities."<br>
