<i>&gt; &gt;  What he said is someone who CHOOSES material privations is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suffering harm, as it is a freely chosen activity.  Someone who chooses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to remain an alcoholic,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; alcoholism is an addiction, a disease.  Some people may choose to be and</i><br>
<i>&gt; remain alcoholics, but others need help.</i><br>
<p>
Nobody forced any one to drink. Its a voluntary action. The number one<br>
quote of the addict is "I can quit anytime I want to" and they can. I<br>
did. Someone who chooses to keep enjoying the effects of a substance<br>
which ruins their lives obviously gets more out of the substance in<br>
value than they lose elsewhere, so they are voluntarily accepting the<br>
cost of their actions.<br>
<p>
The contention that alcoholism is genetic is highly debatable, ANYONE<br>
can becoe an alcholic. The wilingness to remain one is more a matter of<br>
nurture than nature.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I never mentioned alcoholism as dependent on the state of the economy.</i><br>
<p>
I did. 2/3 of the homeless in America are substance abusers, i.e.<br>
addicts. The majority of which have alcohol as their drug of choice.<br>
Ergo, homelessness, once you understand the process of alcoholism, is a<br>
natural funtion of substance abuse, and not the state of the economy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But come to think of it, i suspect you'll find that there are statistical</i><br>
<i>&gt; correlations between Unemployment levels and, Violent Crime, addiction rates,</i><br>
<i>&gt; suicides and mental illness.</i><br>
<p>
yes, you use harmful drigs, yougo crazy, you lose your job, and you are<br>
more likely to kill youself from despair over how much you screwed up<br>
your life. I know, I was there once.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; SOmeone who freely choses not to make the effort to obtain the education</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to earn a good living voluntarily accepts the associated suffering of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; living in poverty. I know, I was there once.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; THe HIGH poverty is a function of the amount of government subsidy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reproduction among those who freely choose to remain in poverty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I strongly disagree.  By your argument, if we exterminated those losers</i><br>
<i>&gt; who "choose" to be poor, then we'll have "solved" poverty.</i><br>
<p>
Well we've certainly proven that the opposite isn't true. We've spent<br>
more on welfare in the last 20 years than on all the wars we've ever<br>
fought, and there's more poor people than ever. Simple biology, you feed<br>
a culture, and it grows. You kill it, it doesn't grow any more. However,<br>
I DO NOT advocate this sort of policy with humans. I do advocate a<br>
policy of cutting off the feed trough. THey have no right to feed off of<br>
my productivity without my approval, just as I don't have a right to go<br>
around with an uzi cleaning up the garbage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your Dale Carngie had it right. We are all free to chose wealth or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; poverty, to choose to be with the families that love us or live alone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; under bridges.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ok, i dare you to *choose* to be a multi-billionaire.</i><br>
<p>
I'm working on that right now as a matter of fact.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yep, extremist-woolly-liberal middle-of-the-road socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not State Socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What's wrong with consumer choice and the voice of the people?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Don't you agree with private property?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or is contract law a problem for you?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or, tort liability?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually i take Mr Proudhons' stance that Property (in Capitalist terms)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is Theft.  If a mining company discovers, claims and mines a large seam of</i><br>
<i>&gt; coal, then i believe that they have stolen it from me and by implication,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the everybody else (aka The People).</i><br>
<p>
Really, I never saw a title with your name on it. If the people pass a<br>
law establishing the mineral claims system, then YOU voted on it buddy.<br>
Funny though, I don't see you saying that income tax is theft, though.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Banjo&gt;&gt;where is the proof ?&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; USSR (past, and for good reason past), Cuba, China and many other nations</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't let the consumer decide anything.  It's all state controlled.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Communism, State Socialism isn't the only form of Socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's unsophisticated and only useful for controlling peasant economies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are many sucessful countries that are Socialist, look to Scandinavia,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Australasia etc</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   Contrast the capitalist countries with these.  Where would you want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; live?  No consumer choice, no property, and only contract law based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government regulation of business deals.  Who has maximized the social</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; outcomes more?   I admit the US has increased the fascist-socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; regulations (private property gun control e.g. Republicans) and the Democrats</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have reduced freedoms ways resembling communism  (increased taxation used for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; welfare programs).   But then, I'm a Libertarian and can see the US slipping</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; away from "Ian's maximum social outcomes".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Taxing the rich (a little) to aid the poor (a little) is not Communism.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, the original term was better and more succinct: "Stealing from<br>
the rich and giving to the poor." Taxation is theft.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You ask me where i would rather live... hey im already here. Godzone New Zealand.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, if there weren't a buch af anti-new-cu-lar nuts in government,<br>
I would probably love to live in NZ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; how does "maximal social outcomes" coincide with high poverty,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  homelessness, a stuffed-to-overflowing penal system, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you talking about the USSR and China?  They are the lowest standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; living I can think of in industrialized countries.  They have high poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and overflowing prisons.  The "homeless" in the US have the highest standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of living than in "homeless"any other county.  Even Jesus said the poor, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will always be with us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, if jesus said it was ok then it must be, not!</i><br>
<p>
just to show that it was true then as it is true now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The USA, USSR and China may be SuperPowers but they ain't the only countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the world.</i><br>
<p>
You take the big seven economies plus China, and the rest of the world,<br>
sorry for the rudeness, ain't worth a bucket of hooey, in comparison.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Dale Carnegie?  Mr. _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.  You are free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to be rich or poor, it is up to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please inform the slum dwellers of Sao Paulo that they've chosen to be poor.</i><br>
<p>
Sure they continually accept the government which represses them in that<br>
squalor. They get the life they vote for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some people don't win in a market economy.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, if your a lazy, drunk, no good slob, an economy that requires you<br>
to work is a real pain in the butt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Im not against a market economy, but i feel that, like all things, it should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be applied in moderation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your argument that some people "are lazy, stupid or pessimistic too", implies</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Calvanist doctrine that the rich deserve to be praised for the wonderful</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualities that made them rich, and that the poor must be chastized for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; being the worthless slobs that they self-evidently are.</i><br>
<p>
So what are you saying......<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe we should drop this or take it to private email,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is this on-topic for extropians ?</i><br>
<p>
how about to alt.reeducation.of.leftist.nincompoops ?<br>
