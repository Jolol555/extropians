Max Rasmussen said, in response to my post about the quiet revolution, "The <br>
problem with that scenario is that it will create a techno elite. And the <br>
great mass of people on earth will be left behind.  I think we should spread <br>
the word as much as possible so as many as possible get a chance to make <br>
educated choices."<br>
<p>
A techno-elite will arise in *any* scenario.  And I, for one, don't see <br>
anything wrong with that.  One can only become a techno-elite by intense <br>
training and personal discipline.  One must learn a tremendous amount of <br>
knowledge and develop a huge array of skills to become a techno-elite.  The <br>
only reason those people are "elite" is because most people aren't comitting <br>
themselves to that sort of intense personal discipline and learning to use <br>
technology with that sort of mastery.<br>
<p>
I am working quite hard at becoming a techno-elite myself.  I want to be <br>
excellent at lots of different technologies.  I don't see anything wrong with <br>
this desire to improve myself radically.  I wouldn't care if the whole world <br>
did the same thing, but the fact that most people aren't will make me an <br>
"elite", since I will have advanced myself far beyond what most people have <br>
the comittment to do.<br>
<p>
Actually, I am considering ways of inspiring the "masses" to become <br>
techno-elites themselves.  I believe that doing it myself and setting a <br>
successful example will be the most convincing way.  Also writing a few books <br>
which provide instruction on how to develop the intense personal discipline <br>
required to become a techno-elite will help those who want to do it <br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
I have nothing against "spreading the word".  I just think that *living* it is <br>
profoundly more important.  But spreading the word far and wide should <br>
definitely be done, with a passion -- I want as many people as possible <br>
becoming techno-elites; I think that is safer than only having a few very <br>
powerful people.  But as important as spreading the word is, actually living <br>
it and becoming a techno-elite oneself is *far* more important -- and it will <br>
make the word one spreads far more persuasive.<br>
