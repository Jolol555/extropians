<i>&gt; &gt;If a limited list has inherent value, why not take the obvious,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;simple, and fair approach of charging for it?  Only those with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;enough serious interest to participate and support the list would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;join, and that level of participation could be adjusted by price.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That would also prevent a scheme like that above from excluding</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;valuable participants with unpopular views or confrontational</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rhetoric, ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You might similarly argue that there are too many trash books</i><br>
<i>&gt; published, so let's put a tax on authors.  The value isn't in limiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number of posts in any ole way, it's in somehow increasing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; average (reader-perceived) quality of posts.</i><br>
<p>
I certainly wouldn't argue anything close to that.  Putting a price<br>
on the list limits it in a very specific way--to those willing to<br>
make a specific commitment to supporting it.  The other objection<br>
raised to my idea is valid--that it hasn't worked historically.  And<br>
this is not a tax in any way--it is a fee for services provided.<br>
A secondary effect is that it would improve the discussion, perhaps<br>
not in the direction you personally might like it improved. <br>
