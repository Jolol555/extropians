&lt;My point is essentially that the complexity that you perceive is in fact a <br>

<p>
You should qualify what you mean by "general classes of problems".<br>
<p>
Perhaps you are thinking of the creation of software-development tools, or <br>
general-purpose/'commodity' tools (like word-processors or spreadsheets), <br>
or real-time process-control applications, or multimedia, or network <br>
management applications - situations where you really are dealing with <br>
'objects' and where performance is paramount.<br>
<p>
I've designed or built a number of budgeting / accounting and other types <br>
of general business or database applications.  I currently support systems <br>
to create and process samples used in calculating the U.S. Consumer Price <br>
Index.  In these types of 'business' applications I work with, I have no <br>
need or desire for the 'heaps &amp; stacks' of complexity you're talking about. <br>
The machinery is totally irrelevant to these types of applications. While, <br>
it might be nice to improve performance, the cost of having people who <br>
understand the machinery, or build optimized, special-purpose objects from <br>
scratch *far* outweighs any performance advantage of working at this <br>
level.<br>
<p>
My impression is that the primary goal of object-oriented development <br>
environments, at least as far as the business world is concerned, is to <br>
create reusable, general-purpose objects that can be easily extended to <br>
handle the particulars of a new problem to be solved, while hiding as much <br>
complexity as possible.  Portability and simplicity of maintainance (mostly <br>
meaning cheap, entry-level programmers wherever possible) is far more <br>
important than performance for these types of applications (which still <br>
account for the bulk of the world's computing, though that is changing ;)<br>
