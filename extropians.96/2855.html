<p>
I have argued from the beginning that we should stick to facts and logic.<br>
It is one thing to suggest the *possibility* TWA Flight 800 was brought<br>
down by a Navy missile.  It is another thing to *announce* that is what<br>
happened -- which is precisely what a couple messages reposted to this<br>
forum did.<br>
<p>
I never ruled out the possibility of a missile.  However, the cover-up<br>
theory as presented is absurd.  It suggested the complicity of an entire<br>
crew of a Navy destroyer, multiple gov't agencies, and the White House.  I<br>
just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees<br>
aren't that competent.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;IAN: So you suggest that questioning the govt and the media, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;mindlessly relays the govt's news feed, is not skeptical inquiry? Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt;proper skepticism is to be directed only at those who question authority.</i><br>
<p>
In fact, it was on the basis of questioning gov't and media that I<br>
suggested Salinger was an unreliable source.<br>
<p>
But look at how quickly you and others embraced Salinger's remarks and<br>
proclaimed victory!  (Remember, you originally stated that Salinger's<br>
comments "proved" it was a Navy missile.)  I don't know what brought down<br>
TWA Flight 800.  The official investigation doesn't appear to know what<br>
brought down TWA Flight 800.  What we should be skeptical about is people<br>
thousands of miles removed, with possible political motivations, or an<br>
affinity for conspiracy theories, making spectacular but unsubstantiated<br>
pronouncemnets about "what really happened."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I remain skeptical about the Navy missile theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IAN: So do I, but I think evidence weighs strongly in that direction,</i><br>
<i>&gt;mostly toward a missile. My chief concern here is why the Navy is so</i><br>
<i>&gt;quickly exonerated. I'd like to encourage people to question authority,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which means don't simply believe everything authoritarian figures say.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rather than encouraging that, you smear such primary skepticism as</i><br>
<i>&gt;mental illness, that's a vicious aggression against skeptical inquiry.</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm.  I distinguish between arguments based purely on appeal to authority<br>
versus arguments that are supported by authoritative sources.<br>
<p>
Never questioning "authority" is one extreme.  Always condemning authority<br>
is another.  In my universe, authority is generally earned, so in itself it<br>
is not bad.  There are abuses of authority.  But guess what?  There are<br>
even more abuses by people with only self-appointed "authority."<br>
<p>
If you are in a position of authority and declare TWA Flight 800 was not,<br>
in your opinion, downed by a missile of any kind your assertion will be<br>
questioned, doubted, and even contradicted twelve ways till Tuesday.  I<br>
don't see why the same shouldn't apply to uncredentialed conspiracy<br>
theorists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've never said "the Navy did it." I believe 90% a missile did it.</i><br>
<p>
I don't have enough information to say it was or wasn't a missile, but I am<br>
increasingly doubtful it was a missile fired by the U.S. Navy and then<br>
covered up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;IAN: Agreed. I question authority, it seems you mostly question</i><br>
<i>&gt;those who question authority, which is fine, so long as we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;resort to the nonlogical method of ad hominem.</i><br>
<p>
I think you are right.  I tend to believe authorities in various fields<br>
before I believe people who come out of nowhere with sensational stories.<br>
However, I also recognize the positive role that radical, "outside"<br>
thinkers can play.<br>
<p>
I notice, however, there are radical optimists and radical pessimists.  I<br>
tend to pay more attention to the former.  In my view, people who come up<br>
with potentially new and better ideas always deserve a hearing.  At some<br>
point, on the other hand, people who continually tell us the truth isn't<br>
what it seems, but can never prove it, and argue that you are obviously<br>
naive or have been duped if you disagree with them, deserve to be tuned<br>
out.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;While Navy Admiral Edward Kristensen left the door open a crack -- properly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;so, as he making statements based on what his staff tells him -- it is now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;clear that Salinger is the intellectually dishonest scoundrel that (ahem) I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;suspected.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IAN: He's a scoundrel because he has documents the GovtMedia does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;like?? Forget the fact that these documents, if they are nothing more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than the internet document, have not, to my knwoledge, been disproven</i><br>
<i>&gt;in any fashion other than that they were anonymous and that the USN</i><br>
<i>&gt;says, "we weren't there." If the authorities say X is true, then X</i><br>
<i>&gt;is true and anyone who says otherwise is an "intellectually dis-</i><br>
<i>&gt;honest scoundrel." I reject that thinking as servile.</i><br>
<p>
He's intellectually dishonest because he tried to take personal credit for<br>
a "document" he never bothered to check out.<br>
<p>
Yes Ian, only a scoundrel would accuse other people of criminal behavior<br>
and then refuse to show the "proof."  This is called slander.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where's your proof that the internet document is false? I just, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;last post, presented evidence that the key feature of disproving it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that area W-105 is not a missile testing area, is compromised by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;USN dude saying the area is "not typically used for missile training."</i><br>
<i>&gt;That does not prove the Navy did it, but it leaves the door open on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the validity of the document. So where's your assumed disproof?</i><br>
<p>
I am not the one trying to prove what happened.  Admittedly, it strikes me<br>
as more honest for a Navy official to leave the door open than for<br>
conspiracy theorists to say with certainty "here is what really happened."<br>
<p>
<p>
I remain skeptical about the conspiracy theory.  I am less skeptical about<br>
a widespread investigation that has not ruled out (last I heard) mechanical<br>
failure, a terrorist bomb, or a missile.  It's the conspiracy theorists who<br>
have already made up their minds and are arguing from emotion.  The<br>
official investigation admits it does not yet have enough facts.<br>
<p>
This plane went down over the Atlantic Ocean.  Many of the "facts" have not<br>
been recovered.  Maybe they never will.  It will probably take a systematic<br>
effort by a large number of trained investigators to get the answer.<br>
<p>
***Skeptics will trust those who are retrieving and examining the actual<br>
physical evidence before they trust those who insist they already know what<br>
"really happened" because they have pieced it together from select media<br>
reports.***<br>
<p>
Know this.<br>
