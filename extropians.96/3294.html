  Yes... scarcity economics.  Funny how different Roddenberry's vision<br>
  is from Heinlein's... So different, in fact, that recent eps of Star  <br>
Trek Voyager seem grossly naive about how much they rock the boat when  <br>
they leave their heavenly riches to decent to a planet where their<br>
very   presence is taxing on the other inhabitants.  From post-scarcity<br>
to     scarcity economics, they just don't seem to realize the huge    <br>
difference.<br>

<p>
  Indeed, it is sometimes enough that one *can* give free lunches that<br>
  makes it just cause enough to do so.  Socrates spoke of producing good<br>
  instead of repaying evil with evil (as later that Jesus person did as<br>
  well).  It is a greater issue of what you can give/perform/do than<br>
what<br>
  you can take/consume/want.<br>

<p>
  Here here!  I've got a new theory burning on my brain...<br>
  I haven't even thought of how to add it to my 'Theories' webpage.<br>
  I refer to it as "Peer Economics."<br>
<p>
  Modern Economics are based on stabilizing life through securing<br>
  propriety of resources, and then weighing the production/abundance<br>
  of supply against the desires/scarcity of demand.  Yet I think the<br>
  point at which they fail is the notion of the "Client - Server"<br>
  relationship.  The almighty dollar is the monopolistic Server (or in<br>
  most cases, the served,) and the humans are the clientele.<br>
<p>
  What would happen if the paradigm were replaced with the modern<br>
  business model of the network?  What if, like organizational<br>
  flowcharts, we flatten the heirarchy and move to "quality control  <br>
circles in constant communication"?<br>
<p>
  We'd likely ditch the paradigm of "Boss - Employee" first thing.<br>
  Instead of the philosophy seen in Plato's day in which the Strong<br>
  Always Rule (not by merit of rulership, but by Might-Making-Right),<br>
  we'd likely see a total change in the job market.  The goals of the<br>
  company/organization whould no longer be the end-all-and-be-all of the<br>
  worker's existance, but rather the company-A would seek work from<br>
  company-B, yet company-B agrees only if it gets its goals achieved<br>
  by company-A.<br>
<p>
  Just as a person's resume includes both their skills and their<br>
expected<br>
  salary, other expectations and job perks may become commonly listed.<br>
  The *Interests* of the superhuman organization may become Peers with<br>
  the Interests of the human individual.<br>
<p>
  Anyone care to speculate further?<br>
