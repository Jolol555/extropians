Well, I've tried twice now, but you still evade the point completely.<br>
It's not just the products that will become easy and cheap to produce,<br>
but the blinking MEANS OF PRODUCTION too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<p>
-  What "retooling", when the tool is configured by software?  Indeed,<br>
   what "tooling", when the basic assembler costs nothing?  (Ie. cost<br>
   of development divided by infinite replication gives zero. :-)  The<br>
   same cost breakdown that applies to products under MNT applies also<br>
   to the in-situ "factories", except for very specialist products.<br>
<p>
-  What "inventing", when 99.9999999999% of everything that people use<br>
   or want is identical to that which their neighbours use or want?<br>
   Yes, there will be some inventing of course, but it'll represent<br>
   only a tiny fraction of post-nano activity, since the means of<br>
   production will be freely available everywhere instead of localised<br>
   only within industrial plants.<br>
<p>
-  What "marketing", when the whole costs/profit basis of current-day<br>
   economics is virtually shattered when dependence on commercial means<br>
   of production disappears almost entirely?  Bespoke production will<br>
   of course remain, along with many other types of production such as<br>
   those requiring very odd raw materials or high energy input, but I<br>
   don't see any role at all for what today is the underpinning of the<br>
   economic system, namely food/clothing/chemical/energy/finance/housing/<br>
   vehicle/computer/software/etc production.<br>
<p>
So far, Robin, you just haven't tackled the impact of MNT affecting also<br>
the near-zero cost and universal availability of the *means of production*<br>
once nanotech becomes public.  Until you do, you will continue to get the<br>
wrong answers from your forecasts, because if the means of production stay<br>
in factories as today then obviously it's still "business as usual".<br>
