The variables that increased during this period were the welfare state and the War on Drugs.  Destruction of the African American family also occured during this period.

Mike responds:<br>
The high gunshot wound rates, as well as all the shooting going on<br>
around the house now, is entierely due the education establishment<br>
exiling gun safety education from the school system. it used to be an<br>
established part of the school system with classes, workshops on gun<br>
rapair, and shooting teams, in rifle, trap, skeet, etc. Now, nobody gets<br>
sufficient safety training and spends zero time in an environement where<br>
peer pressure helps reinforce respect for guns and their safe handling,<br>
unless it is a family tradition. You've got all sorts of idiots who are<br>
functionally illiterate with respect to guns trying to exercise their<br>
rights, but dont know a muzzle from a receiver.<br>
<i>&gt; The American welfare state is especially adept at destroying families.  I'll bet welfare is handled differently in European socialism.  Or maybe the difference lies in greater social cohesion because of fewer minority groups?  Or less intense pursuit of the War on Drugs?  Perhaps the American tax system that encourage Suburban sprawl leaving the underclass fighting among themselves in abandoned inner cities?</i><br>

James, why do your messages never word wrap? Its a royal pain to try to<br>
quote them as the lines are hugely long, not to mention trying to read<br>
them.<br>
