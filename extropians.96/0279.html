Throughout the Europe this percentile is likely to be vastly larger than <br>
50 %. E.g. in Germany there is a variety of state and private (the <br>
latter having entered the scene only quite recently) health insurance <br>
companies. Both the costs of medical treatment and the amount of <br>
nonpaying (state-sponsored) patients have risen dramatically. Health <br>
insurance outfits now tend to step up their payment demands several times <br>
a year. It seems as if either the average quality of medical service <br>
will go down or the whole system is to collapse, leaving behind but a <br>
husk of former price/performance ratio. (At least it will be an autark <br>
and sustainable medicine).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; great deal to do with escalating costs.</i><br>
<p>
But a goodish fraction is caused by the advent of the costly apparative <br>
medicine. As I am writing this, a 5 MDEM Siemens MRI tomograph is <br>
operating the room next door. It needs technicians to operate it as well <br>
as some specialized M.D.'d to interpret the pretty pictures it generates. <br>
Virtually everybody who has health insurance can do a brain scan if he so <br>
wishes -- as associated costs are enormous we obviously have a problem <br>
here.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; [ semiconductor IT system constraints ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Techniques for manufacturing new designs of computing hardware that can</i><br>

<p>
I am tracking their progress as accurately as I can. It is not very <br>
impressive so far. All of these new architectures are implemented in <br>
semiconductor photolitho technology, a fundamentally 2d technique. Since <br>
die/wafer size is limited as well as integration density <br>
as well as top switching speed, we can estimate the top performance limit <br>
of this technology. Though it may appear enormous by today's standards, <br>
it is still a far cry of what biological systems can do. We're bound to <br>
hit a saturation (it can be seen on some plots already) quite soon. No <br>
alternative techniques -- e.g. molecular circuitry -- will be ready by <br>
then, as their development takes a minimum latency. Currently, almost no <br>
research towards molecular circuitry is being done. We are likely to <br>
enter a zone of slow progress, which is likely to delay Singularity <br>
(insert usual disclaimer here).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; more rapidly than our understanding of the brain. I expect that by the time</i><br>
<p>
Au contraire. Neuroscience, augmented by synergistic insights from a <br>
large number other sciences, grows in leaps and bounds. Subjectively, it <br>
is one of the most dynamic sciences I am aware of. Computational physics <br>
is a stagnant pool in comparison to neurosci.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; we develop a theoretical understanding of the nonlinear computational</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes evolved within large unsupervised feedback nets, the hardware</i><br>
<i>&gt; basis for cognitive prostheses will likely be in place.</i><br>
<p>
But it won't be based on silicon semiconductor technology. Since there <br>
isn't any other (unless I failed to notice strong nanotech having become <br>
available already). We'll need drastically different hardware to <br>
interface to the brain constructively.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Or perhaps a more rhetorically effective way to put that: I don't see much</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to think that cognitive science (which is currently stuck in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologically fruitful zone which has very little to do with developing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; theoretical understanding of the way the human brain actually computes)</i><br>
<p>
But don't you see, it is all in the details! If you know both the physics <br>
and have an exhausting knowledge of the structures, the insights you gain <br>
are solely limited by the available modeling power. If you know how the <br>
thing works at an abstract level, then you can build a surrogate, an <br>
ersatz neuron.<br>
<p>
There cannot be any theoretical understanding -- unless the theory <br>
contains lots of messy wet data, which automatically disqualifies it as a <br>
good theory, even an applicable theory. It's just a software package, not <br>
a theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; will *overtake* the engineering of fully-parallel computing hardware, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is currently rocketing along at a merry pace.</i><br>
<p>
Apart from quantum dot 3d arrays, which is but a lab curiousity (no <br>
arrays yet, just dots), I have failed to notice the advent of maspar <br>
machines in the laboratory or the 'real' world. If one comes to <br>
think of it, especially in the real world. Alas, one cannot teach old <br>
programmers new tricks. Remember what happened to Danny Hillis and Thinking <br>
Machines? (I know they are alive again/still).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; And we're going to need both these pieces of the puzzle in place before we</i><br>
<i>&gt; can start doing serious work on soft incremental uploads.</i><br>
<p>
We'll need lots of computational horsepower, agreed. To make sense from <br>
wet data.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  [ Mathematica neuroemplant ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I suspect we'll need an understanding of the computational processes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the brain before we can start hooking any *new* functionality into it, and</i><br>
<p>
All you need to utilize a computer algebra package, is a stream of <br>
chars. Low input bandwidth. To make sense of the data, a visual input is <br>
sufficient. It's hight bandwidth, but it's just rendering. Interfacing a <br>
computer algebra package in this way is almost trivial. It's just one <br>
step after VR. Generating input vectors at will is the only way to make <br>
VR fly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; once we have that understanding, we'll probably use it to build some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; new functionality. Granted that this understanding is nowhere in sight at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the moment.</i><br>
<p>
Hooking low-bandwidth motorics and sensorics into the brain is <br>
comparatively easy. We can do the motorics even now. Sensorics is much <br>
harder, but eventually we will conquer it. Has nothing to do with soft <br>
uploads, this is meek interfacing.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If this fine-grain incremental upload is infeasible, merely beckoning to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the surviving set of strange attractors constituting your personality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with virgin circuitry will depend on their evolution-shaped propensity to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cross over into new territory. Since this never happens in real life (though</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lesion tolerance &amp; recovery is based on semi-dormant, redundant circuitry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;taking over the part of vanquished one), it is not likely to work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Strange. Your parenthesis, which I fully agree with, seems to completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; contradict your main statement. I don't understand why you don't think that</i><br>
<p>
I like self-ref contradictions. (No, I don't, actually).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "semi-dormant, redundant" silicon circuitry could not similarly be</i><br>
<i>&gt; automatically brought into play by the brain as its original tissues fail.</i><br>
<p>
It's not distributed, it is a solid macroscopic lump with sharp boundary. <br>
To insert it, you must carve out a complementary block of tissue. The brain <br>
is somewhat holographic, but there are limits to it. Brain salami uploading?<br>
Uh, thanks, I think it better gotta be Dewar time.<br>
<p>
What's easy for native neurotissue, is damn hard for us. Hardware is <br>
bottleneck, again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course we don't yet understand the processes by which the brain replaces</i><br>
<i>&gt; damaged tissues by bringing new synapses and neurons into play, retraining</i><br>
<i>&gt; them to do the lost functionality, but we certainly do know that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens. That sounds like an existence proof to me.</i><br>
<p>
1 um mobile nanoagents probably could just dig it. With semiconductor <br>
technology, never. <br>

Aw, you know how I meant it. Spatiotemporal acitivity is done by <br>
circuitry, and this circuitry is localized. Cut a wedge from the <br>
circuitry -- the hologramme has grown fuzzier (if you're lucky). The <br>
piece of cake has to be substituted. We don't know the constitution of <br>
the slice we discarded, so we have to rely on that the surrogate is <br>
virtually indistinguishable to a chunk of neural circuitry. On _all_ <br>
functional scales, whether chemical or electrical activity, or whatever <br>
else. Easy, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; properties of a solid, either. Some facts of the universe are just facts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the universe, and one of them is that computational processes in a neural</i><br>

<i>&gt; neural networks, as they learn, build computational structures within</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever hardware they're connected to in the right way. Evolution just</i><br>
<p>
One can't separate the network from the hardware. The hardware defines <br>
the properties of the network. If it prevents mind from spilling over <br>
into fresh circuitry, there is nothing you can do to goad it into it.<br>
<p>
Some NNs do that, yes, if the hardware (which defines the properties of <br>
the NN) attached is the right one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; happened to hit upon the trick of neural networks as a solution for</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational problems faced by animals. That solution may have plenty of</i><br>
<p>
Not only by the animals -- by any entity which has to operate in the real <br>
world. There's a tight limit to what a sequential machine can do (fuck <br>
Turing), and maspar machines converge towards NNs with increasing <br>
parallelility, to become indistinguishable from them at the far end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; properties that aren't selected for, if those properties are inseparable</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the properties that *are* selected for (like being able to make fast</i><br>
<p>
I dunno, I think the fitness function is additive (it's a mental <br>
picture, ok?). One factor demands for fast, robust, power-saving <br>
complex calculations, the other for the tolerancy towards lesions. Both <br>
are unrelated. Since fitness selects for both traits, we have both <br>
competency slots covered. (There are lots of others).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; learned nonlinear transformations of complex time-varying stimuli into</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex time-varying motor activity, and learning those transformations</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, but I doubt this includes lesion recovery. Lesion tolerance, yes, <br>
but not lesion recovery. That's an extra.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Alas, I have grown to distrust this Proteus guy (... you never know who he'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be next ;). Most neuroscientists I know are highly sceptical about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unbound malleability of cerebral circuitry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cognitive science is a highly interdisciplinary field, and most</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychologists I know who understand anything about computation are firmly</i><br>
<i>&gt; convinced of the plasticity of mind. I said nothing about "unbound". It's</i><br>
<p>
Well, you demand for a set of pretty advanced properties. The epithet <br>
'unbound' is hardly inapproriate, methinks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; important to distinguish between computational processes and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; instantiating hardware, even though this is devilishly difficult to do in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the case of the human brain, just as it is with the genetic apparatus.</i><br>
<p>
I would be mad to equal circuitry and its function. If I did, the whole <br>
idea of uploads, whether hard or soft, whether continuous or discontinous <br>
would become laughable. Nevertheless, the implementation <br>
of function demanded, shapes the outlines of the hardware which has to <br>
deliver this performance. (Connectivity, and such).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If incremental soft uploads are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;possible at all, they won't come before Singularity -- and that will be too</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;late. Contrary to Vinge's headbands, I doubt we'll see much of it prior to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Singularity, when every single rule is likely to be broken -- including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the necessity to rely on headbands (or heads).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand this kind of thinking at all. Clearly, whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies we seek to rely on to get what we want are going to have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolve gradually. They are not going to magically appear out of an unfunded</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but consider the speed of the evolution on the far end of the <br>
exponential function. We ain't seen nothing yet. The biggest progress <br>
will come from IT &amp; network connectivity. This means vastly decreased <br>
latency and boosted productivity. Add a thimbleful of agents to automate <br>
the menial tasks, and, voila! look, no hands, mom, the Singularity is <br>
there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; void. There are strong incentives for the development of cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; prostheses; on the other hand, there's practically *no* economic pressure</i><br>
<p>
Demand there might be (I would buy such thing if I could afford it) it's <br>
just that physics/biology seems to forbid it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; for the development of "hard, sudden uploads"... in fact, I can't see any</i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure for this at all outside of the cryonics community. But of course I</i><br>
<p>
How so? There is both a strong push for scanning the shape and <br>
connectivity coming from the discipline of microscopy, an area of pure <br>
science, as well as a strong demand for building autonomous insectoid <br>
agents from industry and mil. E.g. scanning the visual system of the <br>
musca domestica, and then building the hardware to make it fly, would <br>
give us the deadly pilotless fighter Pentagon is currently trying to <br>
develop.<br>
<p>
Cryonics does not count at all, it is by far not influential enough. Too <br>
outlandish a concept for the majority, alas.<br>
<p>

P.S. Btw, I spoke with a M.D. who is currently doing his Ph.D. in MRI <br>
     imaging. He showed me a functional MRI image of a 19 year old male, <br>
     who had suffered a brain hemorrhage at birth. There is lots of <br>
     compensatory activity, but despite all those years in between, his <br>
     hand movements is still inhibited. Our hardware is amazingly <br>
     flexible, yet there are limits to it.<br>
