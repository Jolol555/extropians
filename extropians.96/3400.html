<i>&gt;&gt; HAHAHAHAHA, Oh yeah. This is optimistic!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure quite what you meant by that, but really, the whole thread</i><br>
<i>&gt;was the last straw.  Can't you guys just walk out and do something?  Are</i><br>
<i>&gt;you going to be struck by lightning if you look up his email and send</i><br>
<i>&gt;him some?</i><br>
<p>
Actually I was in the process of it although I was composing the email so<br>
that it sounded highly professional and as non-scifi as possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For crying out loud, what's the worst that can happen?  He's</i><br>
<i>&gt;not going to send out hit squads.  I have to deal with this kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;insecurity and inaction in myself and I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH</i><br>
<i>&gt;IT IN ANYONE ELSE.  You guys have mental energy to burn and you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;sitting around doing less than I am.</i><br>
<p>
Where are you getting this information from? What gives you the impression<br>
that everyone on this list sits on their thumb and reads email without<br>
doing anything? I'm still considering the trekkie booth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Can't I even get a rise out of you people?  Do you think you're going to</i><br>
<i>&gt;get to the Singularity by sitting around and doing nothing?  Someday I</i><br>
<i>&gt;may want minions or advice or even constructive criticism, and I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting it.  I've gotten more constructive criticism from my</i><br>
<i>&gt;technophobic grandparents.</i><br>
<p>
Many of the people on this list are critics leaning heavily on cynics which<br>
is _very bad_. Perhaps its due to attracting people to the mailinglist<br>
where the internet is the land of cheapskates where noone wants to pay for<br>
anything. We must prevent ourselves from the entropy of internet couch<br>
potatoism. I'm even considering bikeing <br>
down to Marina Del Rey to go to the extropian dinner meeting because I<br>
don't currently have decent transportation. I'm hoping my schoolwork won't<br>
get in the way. Can I get a carpool from anyone further south than I?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You're Extropians.  Say something new!  I haven't heard anything new on</i><br>
<i>&gt;this list that wasn't quoted from an article.  Where's the new ideas?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;live off of new ideas.  New ideas are all that's important because it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;new ideas that cause technological progress.</i><br>
<p>
Uhhh, I give new ideas. Just take a look at the archives. I seem to create<br>
many of the  new threads.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a time for for talking, a time for planning, and a time to just</i><br>
<i>&gt;go out and do something.  The time for talking was over when the first</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer was switched on.  The time for talking was over when it became</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible to find out the Meaning of Life by building superintelligences</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of philosophizing.  Now is the time for serious, practical</i><br>
<i>&gt;plans, and occasionally the time for action.  Soon the edge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Singularity will be in full bloom, perhaps before the next summer.  By</i><br>
<i>&gt;that time you'd damn well better have all our plans in place because the</i><br>
<i>&gt;instant it becomes possible, I am going to go out and do something!</i><br>
<p>
Damn! I like this guy! Practical, Positive, with a driving force behind<br>
him. Perhaps I could contact you over the phone! Send me private email.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You think Marc Andreessen would be a valuable recruit?  Send him email. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Send him a letter.  Plan it, design it, or just go out and DO it.  Don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk about it.  ONE POST saying that he'd be a valuable recruit is ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt;that's necessary in the way of talk.  After that, start discussing</i><br>
<i>&gt;practical aspects of the letter ("Should we stress the Singularity, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian culture, or that philosophical question he couldn't answer?"),</i><br>
<i>&gt;or else just send the damn thing.</i><br>
<p>
If we don't go out and do something we'll discuss it forever and it will<br>
eventually entropize into a big semantical discussion which we all agree is<br>
pointless.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The question is how do we get to him? Anyone know ANY POSSIBLE way of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; contacting him? Does anyone have his email and does he actually read it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A practical question!  Unfortunately, it's fairly clear that nobody</i><br>
<i>&gt;tried to look him up via Alta Vista.  "Does he actually read it?"  No,</i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe a secretary does.  But I'm sure someone reads  it.  If that</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't work we can corner him at a convention.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;DO SOMETHING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;DO SOMETHING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;DO SOMETHING!</i><br>
<p>
If I may speak for the group as a whole: Take action NOW! Do WHATEVER YOU<br>
CAN! Grab society by the HUGE GIRTHY BALLS! Anyone wanting to take action<br>
now send me private email and we'll setup something!<br>
