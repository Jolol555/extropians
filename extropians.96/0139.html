IAN: Yes, but only if we conclude that anti-govt types are guilty. Then,<br>
not only will the media broad brush us, but powerful new laws will make <br>
any anti-govt group suspect to FBI surveillance and wire tapping and<br>
more without court oversight. Are "anti-govt" types guilty ?<br>
<p>
Consider the testimony of former Grand Juror Hoppy Heidelberg, in charge <br>
of evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing case, who told the press that, <br>
"No one who saw McVeigh with other suspects, [ such as John Doe #2 ] <br>
was ever allowed to testify before the Federal Grand Jury."<br>
<p>
Mr. Heildelburg was eventually thrown off the jury after he refused <br>
to stop asking questions about John Doe #2. His review of the best <br>
available evidence lead him to conclude: <br>
<p>
        "I think they [ the govt ] know who John Doe #2 is, <br>
        and they are protecting him. This is because John <br>
        Doe #2 is either a government agent or informant <br>
        and they can't afford for that to get out."<br>
<p>
The best article on the Oklahoma Bombing was published in the <br>
Haight Ashbury Free Press, and can be found at:<br>
<p>
        <a href="http://www.webcom.com/haight/Oklahoma/Okc.1.html">http://www.webcom.com/haight/Oklahoma/Okc.1.html</a><br>
<p>
<p>
Also the report by Brigadier General Benton K. Partin (USAF, Air Force <br>
Armament Technology Laboratory. Ret.), presents overwhelming physical <br>
evidence that the Ryder truck bomb in the front could not have done <br>
the damage the Murrah building sustained. <br>
<p>
Ammonium nitrate exerts its strongest explosive force along a vertical, <br>
not a horizontal, axis. An ammonium nitrate / fuel bomb of the size used, <br>
or even much larger, could not exert enough pounds of pressure per square <br>
inch (from blast's epicenter to building) to cut the heavy steel re-bar <br>
reinforced columns, even deep inside the building, as was seen. <br>
<p>
        " Blast through air is a terribly inefficient coupling <br>
        mechanism against heavy reinforced concrete beams and <br>
        columns; blast impulse and its potential for damage - <br>
        drops dramatically when traveling through air, initially <br>
        falling off more rapidly than an inverse function of the <br>
        distance cubed. Even though the Oklahoma City truck bomb <br>
        made an enormous impulse wave, it is wrong, Partin says, <br>
        to be overly impressed and to attribute a force to that <br>
        explosion which it clearly did not have. " (*)<br>
<p>
The Gen. Partin concludes, based on overwhelming evidence, that supplemental <br>
demolition charges, or 'cutter charges,' were placed directly on columns. <br>
Remember that they found 4 unexploded bombs * inside * the building on <br>
the day of the blast, then this fact is forgotten. These may have <br>
been other cutter charges that failed. Some of Gen Partin's report<br>
(massive page - lots of photos): <br>

It is possible that terrorist events could be used as modern day Reichstag <br>
fires, establishing the pretext for massive increases in police state <br>
powers, "new anti-terrorist powers" to be brought to bear against <br>
"anti-govt hard-liners." In fact, that is exactly the result. It <br>
would be too easy -- well, no, .. it IS too easy. But only as long <br>
as people do not question and examine the gov't / media story.<br>
