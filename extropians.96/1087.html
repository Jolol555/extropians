<p>
I'm not an economist, so I don't immediately convert the problem to<br>
one of discount rate. I'll try not to mangle the concept. Basically,<br>
I'm arguing that the discount rate is very high because the SI ability<br>
to<br>
employ the mass of the probe for computation is so large. the only<br>
things<br>
an extra-system probe can eventually contribute are 1) a retrun of<br>
extra-system<br>
mass, or 2) a return of extra-system information. I'm assuming that the<br>
SI will decide that it can use the computational power represented by<br>
the<br>
probe's mass to produce the information locally long before the<br>
information<br>
can be returned fromn an extra-system source. That is, I see that one<br>
side of the<br>
discount ration is very large, and I don't see any equivalent large<br>
value on<br>
the other side of the ratio.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, as you say there seems to be little in the way a human</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or corporation can do in the way of useful self-augmentation. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;contend that an SI that includes a substantial computer component is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;very amenable to useful self-augmentation, while people and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;organizations are not. The reason: the SI can understand itself and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can reprogram itself. I contend that this is fundamentally different</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than the process used by a human or a corporation atempting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;self-augmentation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you think an SI will understand itself any more than we</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand ourselves?  And even if it could, that doesn't mean such</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding will lead to much improvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Basically, I don't believe that we understand the basics of human<br>
cognition.Therefore our attempts at self-augmentation have no firm<br>
basis.<br>
We do, however, understand the basics of machine computation:<br>
we can design and build more powerful computer hardware and software.<br>
Since<br>
we understand this basis already, I believe that an SI can also<br>
understand it.<br>
I believe that an SI with a computer component will be able to design<br>
and<br>
build ever more powerful hardware and software, thus increasing its<br>
own capabilities. I think that this is likely to lead not just to an<br>
improvement, but to a rapid feedback process.<br>
