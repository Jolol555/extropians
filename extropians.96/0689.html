        If this were to happen, potential criminals could get the message<br>
that it's okay to steal rights from another person on the net, but it's not<br>
okay to steal off the net.  What exactly is the difference between on and<br>
off the net?  Stealing is stealing.  If I, E. Shaun Russell, am going to<br>
post a poem somewhere, I like to know that potential criminals may be<br>
deterred by the law.  Whether or not the law is widely enforced is of little<br>
consequence.<br>
If someone reads 'the author requests that you contact him before you take a<br>
copy', then the average person would probably do so.  If there is nothing on<br>
the page that identifies the author's requests, they may accidentally be<br>
broken.  Hence, the copyright law.  The fact that the law is in place can't<br>
hurt anyone.<br>
