Neurons do not divide in adult animals, but it is possible to create<br>
undifferentiated dividing neuroblasts, and I have seen references to a<br>
kind of thermo-sensitive immortalized neuroblasts in mice that begin to<br>
differentiate when placed inside the body, possibly helping to heal brain<br>
damage. I'm a bit nervous about placing such cells in my head, since they<br>
still have the potential to develop into neuromas, but I think this can be<br>
fixed. <br>
<p>
The question is if this is an useful intelligence amplification method. <br>
The number of neurons in a brain doesn't correlate to its intelligence, <br>
it is the way that they are linked together that is important. Just <br>
adding neurons might help replace the degenerative effects of age, but I <br>
doubt it would lead to a drastic increase in intelligence. Still, it <br>
might be interesting to see how learning is affected if neurons are added <br>
to (say) the association cortex. <br>
<p>
Personally I think the best use of add-on neurons would be brain-computer<br>
interfaces: the interface consists of specially bred neurons that grow<br>
axons and dendrites from cell bodies on a silicon sensor, possibly guided<br>
by neurotropic chemicals so that they reach the right parts of the brain. <br>
This could even be made self-repairing and self-extending if there were a <br>
way to grow new interface neurons if needed. <br>
