<i>&gt;These are two different fears.</i><br>
True<br>
<i>&gt;Strange matter would not expand at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;speed of light, but should only convert other nuclei matter it comes into</i><br>
<i>&gt;direct physical contact with.</i><br>
Strange matter would be a planetary disaster and vacuum tear would be a<br>
universe-wide disaster. Lets just hope there isn't a vacuum tear headed our<br>
way accidently triggered by some distant advanced civilization. We wouldn't<br>
be able to see a vacuum tear coming. This could explain why we haven't made<br>
'contact' yet. :(<br>
Heres another interesting theory. What if something we do in the future<br>
causes an explosion in the past which screws up the original universe<br>
singularity and causes the big bang? Then we would be responsible for our<br>
own creation! We wouldn't notice much here in the present but whatever we<br>
did would cause the big bang. Isn't theory fun?<br>
