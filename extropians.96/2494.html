Thank you Shaun.  Especially when we interact in virtual environs.<br>
<p>
To even assume that there is a strict set of codes which enable or castrate<br>
an artist is out to pasture. I have been wondering this afternoon why an<br>
artist  even responds to threads that clearly have little to do with<br>
Extropic Art.  <br>
<p>
Further, we do not need to defend or argue points which are headed<br>
backwards.  Our role is to ignite the imagination - to bring vision.  If our<br>
time is spent explaining what is and is not art, then we might as well sit<br>
up all night in smoke filled cafe's of the early 20th Century.  We are at<br>
the sunset of the 20th Century.  We have an opportunity to set a pace with<br>
the 21st Century - now.<br>
<p>
Rather than spend time debating about what is or isn't art, why not debate<br>
whether to use VR in our next performances, which designs to use to create<br>
robotic sculptures, whether or not neon or fiber optics is the way to go<br>
when implementing an electronic memetic billboard.  We can exchange ideas<br>
with other technicians about designing interactive electronnic<br>
communications projects, or scientists about next years collaborative Ars<br>
Electornica in France, or ARTEC in Japan.<br>
