If there is any sensible distinction between observation and<br>
experiment, it is in one's degree of control over a system.  Observers<br>
look, while experimenters change things (and look).  Of course<br>
observers can look at things from different angles, at different<br>
times, at different frequencies, etc.  And they can choose what to<br>
focus attention on.  But if obervation vs. experiment means anything,<br>
this type of control does not imply its an experiment.<br>
