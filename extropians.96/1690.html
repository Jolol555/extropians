<i>&gt;Can someone update me on the state of brain-computer interface research? </i><br>
<i>&gt;have the managed to control circuits with nerve impulses yet? I remember </i><br>
<i>&gt;reading this once, but I`m not sure. If they have, then what have they </i><br>
<i>&gt;been doing since. A project I and some friends are working on is </i><br>
<i>&gt;interfacing an EKG with a commputer. We got ahold of an old EKG, and it`s </i><br>
<i>&gt;sitting in a basement waiting for us to put it together and hook it up to </i><br>
<i>&gt;a computer.   </i><br>

Hello Suresh:<br>
The field of brain/machine interface, or what I tend to refer to as<br>
"mind machine" interface, is quite extensive, and goes far beyond some<br>
of the current commercial gagedtry offered by companies such as BioMuse,<br>
and others plying this market.  Incidentally, the preceding comment was<br>
in no way intended to impune the quality or intent of the product line<br>
produced by BioMuse, which is probably the best "consumer" grade EEG and <br>
EMG interface components currently available.   <br>
<p>
I happen to be the science editor for Mondo 2000 magazine, the most recent <br>
issue (# of which has just gone into circulation, featuring my article on the<br>
<p>
topic of "Mind Machine Interface".  My background is a combination of <br>
computer science and physics, although I have had more than "a tad" of <br>
of exposure to neural physiology and biosensory system development over <br>
the course of my somewhat diverse and meandering work history.<br>
<p>
In the above mentioned article I provide extensive detail on the currently<br>
available technology, as well as an overview of the developmental history<br>
of all aspects of electro-neural signal analysis, utilzation of SQUID<br>
detector systems, 3D volumetric elctro-chemical event capture via<br>
ultra sensitive NMR cameras, group mind experiencial event interfacing, <br>
and so on.  You will also find a example resource and bibliographic<br>
reference listing embedded in the article as well.  Commercial efforts<br>
at implementing dynamic neural signal interfacing systems, such as <br>
AquaThought, may also be interesting to you.<br>
<p>
And finally (for the moment), my first efforts at creating my own<br>
"home brew" EEG amplifier and spectral analysis/FFT processor engine<br>
for detecting brain wave patterns and developing an interpretational<br>
referencing protocol was back in the early '80's, which was about when<br>
BYTE magazine published a series of articles about the "HAL" brain<br>
wave detector and analysis hardware and software (I believe it was <br>
June / July '82). <br>
<p>
In any case, I wish you luck on your quest for further useful knowledge <br>
in this area.  Let me know, if you wish, if you are developing any<br>
applications along these lines.<br>
<p>
<p>
most sincerely,<br>
<p>
