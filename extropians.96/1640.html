Your informant must have been thinking about an article that appeared in the<br>
so-called "forbidden" issue of Extropy:  "Sexual Information," 3 EXTROPY 22<br>
(Spring 1989).  The author (the name of whom I can't quite place!) says:<br>
<p>
"[O]rgasms are so great . . . because they correlate with the exchange of<br>
genetic information. As it turns out, we like sex (with or without orgasms)<br>
for much the same reason. Sex is so great because it allows us to communicate<br>
so much information."<br>
<p>
And further:<br>
<p>
"Why should we enjoy information so much? Just as we've been naturally<br>
selected to enjoy the exchange of genetic information, so too have we been<br>
naturally selected to enjoy the exchange of information in general. The more<br>
we learn about the world around us, and the more we share what we learn with<br>
those we live with, the more likely we are to survive.  Our desire for sexual<br>
information manifests a more universal trait: the desire to exchange<br>
information of all sorts.  Sex is special, of course -- it offers us<br>
especially rich inputs and outputs. That's exactly why sex is so great."<br>
