I agree with Robin. But even without atatement  that I still<br>
*totally*disagree with Chris Hind, IMO Extropians are usually willing to<br>
discuss any creative, productive , futurist topic as long as it is possible<br>
to have a rational conversation about it and learn or share<br>
knowledge..Havelearned moe abou tmany diverse things...<br>
I think more disciplined cohesive topics, rather than diversifying.<br>
...and as an artist ( non Academic) the standard of knowing a medium  is<br>
making contribution as well... but .....I want to hear people knowledgeable<br>
discuss AI, nanotech , futurestuff and so forth, that's why i come here....<br>
there are lots of forums for lots of topics... extropians is presumably for<br>
exponents of Extropy. : ) Maybe,Chris you should listen more and learn all<br>
you can 'bout these topics before you criticize,mmmm?....<br>
