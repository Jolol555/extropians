<i>&gt; Walter Wlodarski asks, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you know someone who tried to construct a language </i><br>
<i>&gt; as a tool for thinking? </i><br>
<p>
The connection between language and thinking is a lot stronger than <br>
most people suspect.  <br>
<p>
What worries (and inspires) me <br>
the most about language is that it's <br>
basic nature hasn't changed in thousands<br>
 of years, we still link idea <br>
packages (words) to each other in a <br>
linear fashion.<br>
<p>
                                        After all language is our <br>
                                        primary popular method for <br>
                                        abstracting reality (ignoring <br>
                                        for a moment specialist <br>
                                        languages like maths).  <br>
<p>
Another huge leap in improving <br>
communication will happen when <br>
we start using VR technology as a <br>
comm. tool by writing in 3D.<br>
<p>
                                        This is mainly due to our <br>
                                        reliances on speech (through <br>
                                        one mouth).  Written language <br>
                                        has always been done on a 2D <br>
                                        surface,  Hypertext is <br>
                                        a glimpse of what our future <br>
                                        communication systems might <br>
                                        look like, by adding more <br>
                                        dimensions.   <br>
<p>
As more of our communication moves <br>
to the electronic platform, <br>
written speech will become less <br>
important, less productive and more <br>
of a subset of communication <br>
than it's very backbone.  How <br>
about communicating by thinking<br>
images onto a window on the screen <br>
while written text pieces jump out <br>
at you accompanied by various <br>
emotive sounds.  <br>
                                      Parallel-non linear languages <br>
will free                                       <br>
       our minds from a thousands year old <br>
                         thinking paradigm, making <br>
thinking and communicating<br>
<p>
 a <br>
 much <br>
 more                  <br>
                                     liquid experience               <br>
                            <br>
