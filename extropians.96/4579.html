The Bekenstein Bound is thought by almost everybody to be true, because it   <br>
just seems like Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle expressed in a different  <br>
way, however nobody has yet been able to formally prove it. There are several   <br>
"proofs" floating around in the literature, but all of them are wrong,  <br>
I think even Bekenstein would admit that. <br>
<p>
Even if The Bekenstein Bound is true, Tipler found a way that the Universe  <br>
could hold an infinite amount of information, he wants to store information  <br>
as standing waves that span the entire universe. As the universe shrinks  <br>
toward The Big Crunch the amount of time needed to access this information is  <br>
reduced too, but so is the amount of energy needed to store a bit of <br>
information, because you need to keep making your information storing photons  <br>
at a shorter and shorter wavelength and that takes energy. If you only have a  <br>
finite amount of energy this would be a fatal problem, but if the universe  <br>
shrinks to a geometric point then the amount of gravitational energy in the<br>
Universe would diverge to infinity, and if the collapse is NOT symmetrical  <br>
then the energy is usable because one part of the sky would be hotter than <br>
another so you can run a heat engine.<br>
<p>
Before we can know if this would really work we need a Quantum Theory of <br>
Gravity so we can know what happens when the Universe gets smaller than  <br>
10^-33cm, The Plank Length.  By the way, I'm looking forward to reading  <br>
Hans Moravec's new book "MIND AGE", I think it's a scandal he's had so much  <br>
trouble getting it published.<br>
