From: Chris Hind &lt;chind@juno.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Probably most people will go the way of the gradual</i><br>
<i>&gt; incremental upload due to the fact that people are already thinking about</i><br>
<i>&gt; designing augmentation tools (ie. genetic augmentations for when</i><br>
<i>&gt; genengineering improves, and chips such as British Telecom's vision</i><br>
<i>&gt; recording chip).</i><br>
<p>
OK, supposing that most people do gradually, incrementally upload.<br>
What happens then?  When you are a computer program running in machine 1,<br>
and you have an opportunity to shut down and start up (where you left<br>
off) in roomier machine 2, will you take it?  Or will you insist on<br>
"gradually, incrementally" moving to machine 2, with first one line of<br>
code, and then another, moving over?<br>
<p>
What if you have the option to keep running in machine 1 and also start<br>
up in machine 2?  Are you going to take it, or would you feel better if<br>
your machine 1 program was stopped when the machine 2 program started?<br>
<p>
Will the machine 2 program be the same "you" as when you were the machine<br>
1 program, or is it a different program that just thinks it's "you"?<br>
<p>
I find that when I think of myself as a program in this way, I am<br>
inclined to believe that my identity is preserved across these kinds<br>
of interruptions and copies.  This leads me to conclude that the same<br>
thing is true about copies which span meat and machine.<br>
