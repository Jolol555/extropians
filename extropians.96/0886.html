<i>&gt; &gt;computational cycles into the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There seeem to be two different scenarios here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. The intelligence in a star system may at some point be no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in increasing computational ability.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. The other is that discount rates may colonization not</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost-effective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On 1. The effective net values of a star system will be composed of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the values of its many components.  Even if most of these components</i><br>
<i>&gt; suddenly no longer desire computation ability, some components surely</i><br>
<i>&gt; will.  And some components will surely value exploration and</i><br>
<i>&gt; colonization for its own sake.  Even within a group the size of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list we have a wide variety of goals regarding our futures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On 2. Even just looking at the goal of maximizing computation, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to remember that discount rates are evolutionarily endogenous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If there are many different components with different discount rates,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ones that come to dominate the population are the ones whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; discount rates are best tied to the feasible growth rate.  If solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; system limits are hit, so growth stops, then components who value</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer and longer time scales will come to dominate, until extra-solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; colonization efforts start to look attractive.</i><br>

In your (excellent) terms, my "plasuible scenario" is actually<br>
a little different: the  discount rate has a very large discontinuity at<br>
the point when all in-system resources are exhausted being used<br>
"optimally"<br>
for computing. At this point the system-wide SI is likely to use its<br>
computational<br>
capacity to exhaustively analyze its next move. What if the only logical<br>
conclusion A system-wide SI can reach it that out-system resoureces are<br>
uneconomical?<br>
<p>
Both of your arguments make the same funcamental assuption that<br>
there is more than one SI in a star system. This is also a fundamental<br>
assmption in the "Great Filter" paper. My "plausible scenario" makes<br>
the opposite assumption, that a single SI takes over the star system.<br>
<p>
In regard to the "great filter", the argument (mangled and<br>
grossly oversimplified by me) is :<br>
<p>
      We haven't heard from them, therefore they aren't out there.<br>
      If they were out there then (because there are a lot of them),<br>
      we would have heard from at least some of them.<br>
<p>
The argument may have a flaw: There may not be a lot of diverse SIs<br>
in the universe. There may be only one per system, and they may all<br>
have reached the same super-logical conclusion that star travel is<br>
uneconomical in terms of the resources that SIs use. <br>
<p>
BTW, I feel that the scenario is plausible. That doesn't mean that I<br>
think<br>
it's the only plausible scenario, and it doesn't mean that I like it.<br>
