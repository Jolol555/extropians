to which Ira Brodsky replied: <br>
<i>&gt; What double-talk.  You have announced there is an AI on this list, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but assure us those responsible will deny it.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, actually I don't know for sure that they would deny it.  <br>
Why don't you call them or send them e-mail?   I'm surprised that <br>
no one has done this yet.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At best, you are not one to be trusted with secrets.  At worst, </i><br>
<i>&gt; your reaction to my request that CMU confirm what you have </i><br>
<i>&gt; already told us is disingenuous.  </i><br>
<p>
In other words, I could be pulling your leg.  Obviously, this has been <br>
a possibility all along.  That's what makes it a real test.  You don't <br>
know that there is an AI on the list.  You only have an assertion <br>
that there is an AI.  It's up to you to decide whether this assertion is <br>
true or not.  You're on your own.  Why does that bother you?  <br>
Why do you keep trying to peek behind the curtain?  <br>
<p>
The fact remains that you have not stated unequivocally that <br>
all the posts on the list are written by humans.  <br>
<p>
Are you willing to state, on the basis of your own judgment, that the <br>
posts attributed to "Chris" are written by Chris?  Likewise for "Dan," <br>
"Damien," and everyone else.  If you are not willing to make such a <br>
statement, why not?  <br>
<p>
To repeat:  <br>
<p>
::As I said in my original post, <br>
::<br>
::The Extropians have accepted it as part of the group.  No one notices <br>
::anything different about it -- no one has seriously raised the question of <br>
::whether it might not be what it purports to be, i.e. just another human.  <br>
::In other words, this program has passed the Turing test, so far.  <br>
::<br>
::This remains true.  Even after being told that there is an AI on the list, <br>
::no one has seriously raised the question of whether one of the posters <br>
::on the list is an AI.  Jokingly, yes.  Seriously, no.  <br>
::<br>
::The program continues to pass the test with flying colors.  <br>
<p>
It is winning a stunning victory.  The AI has totally fooled everybody, <br>
so you think I *must* be pulling your leg.  This is like Deep Blue <br>
defeating Kasparov 12 - 0, twelve straightforward checkmates in a row.  <br>
