It's called Newcomb's paradox and is a a good example of the limits to self <br>
knowledge, I can't predict what I'd do. I hope my mind is constructed in such <br>
a way that I'd resist temptation and only take box A . The only justification <br>
I could  give myself is that it's as logical as the other choice, I hope that <br>
would be convincing enough for me but I'm not sure.   <br>
<p>
Minds can be put into 3 categories based on their construction.<br>
<p>
1) Those who pick only box A and get a million dollars.<br>
<p>
2) Those who pick box A and B and get a lousy thousand dollars.<br>
<p>
3) Those who think they will pick box A, but once they walk into that room <br>
   they will reason that Omega has already made his choice and so they might <br>
   as well pick both boxes. These poor souls also lose out on the big bucks.<br>
        <br>
I think I'm in the first category but perhaps not.<br>
