Thinking seems to be a dangerous thing.<br>
The more I think, the more I feel confused about everything.<br>
Now, I am trying to understand the relation between software<br>
agents and their historical predecessors (higher liquidity<br>
seems to be the primary difference) and also I am reading <br>
Mirror Worlds by David Gelernter where he suggests to create<br>
real-time models of the various systems that would allow us<br>
to perceive and affect the world with a much richer interface,<br>
share representations, etc.  Should be easier to deal with<br>
than the Real World, he says.  I would agree, except that we<br>
had always contacted the Real World via sensors and actuators.<br>
So will we have a model here, or extended body, or shared<br>
consciousness?<br>
<p>
My favorite confusion now is on what "carries" what in the world.<br>
We all know that walls carry paint, people carry ideas,<br>
hardware supports software that runs on it, brain supports<br>
consciousness, etc.<br>
<p>
Last year, Minsky on one of his lectures mentioned a red cube -<br>
i.e. an object (cube) that has a quality (redness) to it.<br>
With my usual habit of arguing I suggested to look at it as<br>
a _red_ object with a quality of "cubeness" to it.  Why not?<br>
Or just say that an object is a set of qualities/features,<br>
and all of them are comprise it together. So if you strip<br>
all features off, there is no object left.<br>
Our compromise then was that shape seems to be a more persistent<br>
feature than color, so we can call whatever is persistent an<br>
object, and whatever isn't, feature.  Now, if you had a world<br>
of things that would retain color but not shape, you would think<br>
of "cubic reds".<br>
  Now, people have ideas. Or run them, as hardware runs software.<br>
People are persistent physical things, ideas are flexible and transient;<br>
also, ideas depend on people.  Hmm...  Physical nature doesn't seem<br>
to be relevant here; who says that ability to communicate to<br>
other objects via gravity or electricity is "existentially superior"<br>
to the ability to communicate via, e.g., http protocol?  Persistence?<br>
Many ideas are more persistent than most people.  Dependence?<br>
Suppose you know arithmetic and count things for living.<br>
Does it mean that you support and carry the arithmetic, or<br>
that arithmetic supports you and carries you through life?<br>
<p>
When software and [successors of] nanotech gain enough control over<br>
matter so that physical objects would be all in flux, created and<br>
disassembled on the whim of immortal functional entities, will that<br>
mean that software will be "running" hardware?<br>
Will things change dramatically then?  Or we'll keep claiming that<br>
things that we can perceive directly run things that we can't perceive<br>
directly?  (Do I have a more direct perception of gravity than of logic?<br>
- Not if "I" is consciousness!).  Did the debate of what carries what<br>
ever make sense?<br>
<p>
Did I carry these ideas to my computer, or they carried me to it?<br>
<p>
<p>
Confused,<br>
