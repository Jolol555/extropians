        Sounds like semantics to me.  Sorry if this seems underhanded, but<br>
I'm trying to make a point.  As I said in the first paragraph of my initial<br>
post, I wasn't trying to single anyone out in particular, just bringing<br>
forth a few examples of what I see as unimportant to extropians.  Again,<br>
this doesn't mean that the issues aren't important per se, but probably less<br>
important on this list.<br>
