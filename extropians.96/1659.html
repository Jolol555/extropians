Actually, there doesn't seem to be any real pleasure centers in the <br>
brain. In the 50's (?) researchers experimented with rats having <br>
electrodes implanted in various parts of the brain, and found that in <br>
some areas the rats would do anything to get stimulance. This led to the <br>
theory that there were "pleasure centers", invoking nightmarish visions <br>
of electrical addiction (Niven's "tasp"). But later implants in humans (I <br>
think doctor Robert Heath and Jose Delgado were the pioneers here - <br>
anybody who knows what they do now?) turned out a bit differently. There <br>
were some ares where they felt pleasant stimuli, but no electronic <br>
orgasms. However, it became clear that the relevant areas were rather <br>
motivation systems - in some sense motivation is deeper than <br>
pleasure/pain, although they are often hard to distinguish.<br>
<p>

<p>
Is there really a difference? In some sense our intellectual functions <br>
are physical too.<br>
<p>
As far as I know, the structures to look at is in the limbic system and in<br>
the brainstem, especialy the dopaminergic system that reaches into the<br>
limbic system and the cortex.  Especially important is the nucleus<br>
accumbens, which appears to be the central relay point (all<br>
psychologically addicting seem to drugs stimulate this nucleus), and the<br>
mesolimbic nerve bundles reaching the frontal cortex which link our<br>
actions and cognition with pleasure/motivation - if they are severed<br>
nothing seems to have any special meaning, and if they are weakened the<br>
person needs stronger stimuli to "feel alive". <br>
<p>
This is an exciting area, which I unfortunately haven't had the <br>
opportunity to study well enough. <br>
