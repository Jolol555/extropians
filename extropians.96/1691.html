<i>&gt; &gt;1) Assumption: the compuer component contributes non-trivially to the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;2) Observation: computer hardware and software technology are advancing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   at an empirically-observed exponential rate known as "Moore's Law",</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   which we both agreed is unlikely to change in the near future. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   rate is dramatically faster than the 30-year sustained rates of increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   of the other technologies you mention.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;3) Assumption: a more-intelligent entity can develop intelligence-augmentation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   faster than a less-intelligent entity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;4) Conclusion: This is a fast-feedback loop.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Various measures of computer cost and speed have had a roughly</i><br>
<i>&gt; constant growth rate over four decades (or more?)  During this time</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world economy has doubled (more than once?) the computer industry</i><br>
<i>&gt; has doubled many times, and computers are lots more available.  Thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; this growth rate does not seem especially sensitive to the size of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world economy or the computer industry, or to computer availability.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or perhaps it is senstive, but such effects are just about canceled</i><br>
<i>&gt; out by the computer design problem slowly getting harder.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It sounds like you think this growth rate is sensitive to "researcher</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence".  Note though that the growth rate hasn't changed much</i><br>
<i>&gt; even though computer companies now hire lots more researchers than</i><br>
<i>&gt; they once did, because the industry is larger, and though they could</i><br>
<i>&gt; have instead hired the same number of researchers that they did at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; beginning but made sure they were the IQ cream of the crop.  So that</i><br>
<i>&gt; degree of IQ difference doesn't seem to make much difference in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth rate.  And note that the average researcher today is smarter</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the average one 40 years ago, because humanity knows so much</i><br>
<i>&gt; more.  And note that researchers today have access to lots more</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers than they once did, and that hasn't made much difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So you posit an effect of researcher IQ on computer growth rates that</i><br>
<i>&gt; can not be substituted for by hiring more researchers, or by having</i><br>
<i>&gt; them know more, and that is not very strong for small IQ differences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So at what level of increased IQ do you expect this effect to kick in?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And you posit an effect of more computer access on IQ that we haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen yet.  So at what level of computerization do you expect this</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect to kick in?  And why should we believe in either of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; not-yet-observed effects?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
My argument starts with assumption (1) above. That's why its the<br>
first assumption. The effect will kick in when the very first<br>
human/computer joint entity (or other entity with a computer as<br>
a substantial contributor to its intelligence) comes into<br>
existence. It will then get more intelligent as a result of increases<br>
in the capabilities of its computer part. So far, no feedback is<br>
involved. Then it will get rapidly more intelligent as it uses this<br>
intelligence to better use its computer part. The major difference<br>
here is that the computer will contribute directly to the intelligence<br>
of the entity. I claim that this is different in kind than the<br>
contributions to intelligence of the other technologies you cite.<br>
