<i>&gt;The history</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the prohibition of alcohol (another neurological scourge) earlier</i><br>
<i>&gt;this century in the US tells a similar tale.</i><br>
<p>
The "War on Drugs" is an impossible battle. Supporters shall never win.<br>
Substance desire is far stronger than legislation and big sticks to beat<br>
you with. People stupid enough to become addicts will sacrifice their life<br>
for a fix. Why try to fight something that you cannot possibly win due to<br>
physical laws that cannot be broken. That is unless you're into marshall<br>
law in which then you should enjoy living in iron-curtain countries. Think<br>
of it this way, the strong will survive. Unfortunetly there is no way to<br>
fight this but the addicts will die off and with them their genes.<br>
Addiction is a combination memetic/chemical plague where the substance is<br>
willingly accepted through social interaction. You could compare substance<br>
addiction to a biolevel 4 virus entering a population. The ideal life of<br>
viruses are living in their hosts for awhile, letting them suffer and<br>
eventually killing them. Biolevel 4 viruses like Ebola have just recently<br>
jumped ship from one type of animal to another and haven't had the time to<br>
adjust to the new medium and evolve to the ideal condition. This causes<br>
them to create short-lived outbreaks where they attempt to make the leap<br>
and adjust to the ideal condition but inevitably fail. But trust me they<br>
are trying. To summarize all this: Substance Abuse is like Ebola, it sweeps<br>
through a population and eventually the population builds up a genetic or<br>
biological immunity to it.<br>

Oh shit! I feel soo bad that you had to go through something like that.<br>

Kinda contradictory isn't it? Do as I say, not as I do. Thats why I'm not a<br>
vegitarian and am all for fur, leather, hunting, individual freedom, and<br>
right to bear arms. 'least I'm consistant. More than I can say for many others.<br>
