I don't see how.  Does the universe have objective meaning or purpose?<br>
I don't see how, and then how does anything within it have meaning or<br>
purpose, unless we give meaning to it?  The universe exists.  I exist,<br>

which I happen to have.<br>

I like the views of Pratchett's wizards and witches: "Who am I?  Me.<br>
Where am I?  Here.  Where's here?  Good question, let's take a look."<br>

The most generalizable purpose of life is to make more life.  That<br>

If it's so objective, why is anyone not extropian?  I can call myself<br>
an extropian because the purposes described by Max More et al. coincide<br>
with my personal purposes.  This seems to be related to the question of<br>
objective values, which I also don't believe in -- I can just expect<br>
most life forms to value their existence more than mine, and to value<br>
their generative process.<br>

Exactly.  Someone else says "Be fruitful and multiply!"  Someone else<br>
again says "Prevent all change, because that would require me changing,<br>
and that would destroy me."<br>

"Does it occur to you, the fallibility of CIT thinking?  Flux-thinking.<br>
You have prophetic dreams, remember?  You can dream about a man drinking<br>
a glass of milk.  A week later you can see Yanni drinking tea at lunch<br>
and if seeing him do that has a high shock-value, you'll super the<br>
dream-state right over him, you'll swear you dreamed about him doing<br>
that, exactly at that table, and even psychprobe can't sort it out after<br>
that." -- Grant ALX, _Cyteen_, C.J. Cherryh<br>
