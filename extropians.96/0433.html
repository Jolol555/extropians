I thought I'd talk a little more about Robin Hanson's 7 stages life must go <br>
through before it can change the universe on a Cosmological scale.   <br>
Robin's 7 stages are:  <br>
        <br>
1. Reproductive something (e.g. RNA)    <br>
2. Simple single-cell life <br>
3. Complex single-cell life <br>
4. Multi-cell life  <br>
5. Animals with big brains  <br>
6. Where we are now  <br>
7. Explosion <br>
        <br>
<p>
About stage 1: Although organisms that used only RNA would be much simpler  <br>
than modern creatures that make use of DNA, RNA and proteins,  some think <br>
they would still be too sophisticated to be the first forms of life. <br>
If you define life as information that changes by natural selection then <br>
chemist Graham Cairns-Smith says that the first life was not made of RNA but<br>
of clay (oxides of silicon and aluminum). It's well known that clay can act <br>
as a catalyst and store energy, it also has the most complicated chemistry of <br>
any non biological substance. Cairns-Smith thinks clay may be able to store <br>
information as patterns of ions or defects in the crystal lattice of large <br>
2 dimensional sheets. As the crystals grow the patterns might be duplicated <br>
in new layers. He wrote a book about this  "Genetic Takeover And The Mineral <br>
Origins Of Life".  Also in note that in the August 8 issue of Nature is an <br>
article about peptides  acting as a self catalyst.  <br>
<p>
<p>
About stage 2 : I think simple life forms are probably easy to make, at least <br>
on Earth it was, although I wish my reasoning was based on more than  one <br>
example. Induction certainly works better if you have more than one instance, <br>
but that's all I have to work with. On earth life seems to have started as <br>
soon as it possibly could, as soon as the planet cooled enough to allow <br>
liquid water. Having got to this stage it was not easy to leave it, life <br>
stayed stuck here for over 2 billion years.<br>
<p>
<p>
About stage 3: It must be hard to make a multicellular life form that is good <br>
enough to compete with single cell life, it took a long time to figure out <br>
how to do it. Live was stuck here for about 700 million years.<br>
        <br>
<p>
About stage 4: For long while Evolution didn't have much interest in large  <br>
brains ("Brains? We don't need no stinking brains!"). It took nature almost  <br>
570 million years to change it's mind.<br>
<p>
<p>
About stage 5: If you went back just 3.5 million years, the time our most  <br>
famous ancestor "Lucy" was alive, the largest brain on Earth and probably the <br>
most powerful, was not on the earth, it was in the sea. Even today the <br>
largest brain on the planet is possessed by the Sperm Whale. I don't think  <br>
a brain, regardless of how big, is enough to get you out of this stage, <br>
you need a hand too, and that may be even more difficult to evolve. Common<br>
sense would indicate that a large brain must come first because a hand is of <br>
no use if you don't have a big brain to direct it, but common sense is wrong <br>
and it's not at all clear why. Nobody knows why bipedalism was developed, <br>
it seems like a dumb form of locomotion, but Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) <br>
could walk upright as well as you or me, and like modern humans, she had short <br>
fingers and a fully opposable thumb.  This was not very good for climbing <br>
trees but it's great for precision gripping. From the neck down Lucy was <br>
pretty modern, but her brain was only about as big as a modern day chimp. <br>
After Lucy the brain increased in size at an enormous rate, and I don't think <br>
that would have happened if Lucy didn't have such a good hand, and nobody <br>
understands why Evolution gave her that good hand.<br>
        <br>
<p>
About stage 6: If we ever get out of this stage we'll do it in less than a <br>
thousand years, probably a lot less. It appears that each stage is shorter <br>
than the one before.<br>
