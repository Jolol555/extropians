Are you implying that a more biological/environmental approach to<br>
transhumanism in general would be a path that ultimately leads to stagnation ? <br>
<p>
I was suggesting a biological approach as an 'addition' to the technological<br>
options. Making a future human as versatile as possible. I also don't<br>
suggest anything 'permanent'. But i ask the question: why should we exclude<br>
environmental options ? Surely living harmonically with ones environment is<br>
a rational thought. Either increasing the quality of that environment, or<br>
the efficiency with which humans use its resources, will make it a more<br>
productive one. I don't think we should exclude any options to acchieve that<br>
purpose. <br>
<p>
a culture that replicates itself endlessly, and never gives birth to<br>
anything new, could well happen within a posthuman society based only on<br>
more 'materialistic' transformations. I don't think it has much to do with a<br>
technological path chosen, but more with the cultural goals of such a society.<br>
<p>
I can just as easily imagine a robot society just 'reproducing' itself with<br>
the only goal of 'spreading' or replicating, than a combined<br>
biological/technological posthuman culture.<br>
<p>
Today we depend on an oxygen/nitrogen/co2 atmosphere as well as 'food' for<br>
our energy needed to function. I'm not suggesting we replace that by just<br>
solar power. That would just shift our dependance on one resource to another. <br>
<p>
Rather i suggested as an option to include it in a multiple energy resource<br>
system, which will both make posthumans more versatile, and make them able<br>
to use those available resources more efficiently.<br>
