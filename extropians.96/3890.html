        Well, I cannot wholly speak for Anders or Max, but I'm pretty sure<br>
that none of us are gathered round the fireplace and looking expectantly up<br>
our respective chimneys --I don't even have a chimney &lt;g&gt;.  All joking<br>
aside, I've never doubted the possibility of a 'singularity', nor have I<br>
doubted the impossibility of such an event.  Realistically, I think it is<br>
very possible...if there is some way to initiate it.  Right now, I'll do<br>
everything I can do to preserve and extend my life, as well as enhance my<br>
human functions.  I am *by no means* relying on the profits of the<br>
'singularity' to do things for me.  Don't get me wrong, I think a<br>
'singularity' will bring a tremendous amount of new technology to the<br>
forefront, but I've never been one to rely on things I am not sure of.<br>
Oh, and one extra note, I don't think humanity needs to be annihilated for a<br>
'singularity' to occur.<br>
