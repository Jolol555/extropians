<p>
Actually, I did not read his suggestion of substitution as a parody,<br>
because I have theorized on, as others have, of the current existence of<br>
transhuman organisms here on earth, operating at such a slow baud rate<br>
that they are not noticed by us. They are commonly referred to as a:<br>
"nation", "corporation", "government", "ethnic group", "profession",<br>
"species", or "ecosystem".<br>

I noticed that same thing, being raised a Catholic and all... I suppose<br>
that transhumanism is a way for me to reconcile my intellectual need for<br>
reason, to the hope for becoming greater than oneself, transcending,<br>
becoming one with the ALL, that has been taught as Catholic Dogma and<br>
demanded as faith in spite of the past 2000 years of showing little<br>
improvement in situation of mans inhumanity to man. That following the<br>
Golden Rule and keeping an open, inquisitive mind one day at a time, one<br>
person at a time will boot strap us all to a better tomorrow.<br>
