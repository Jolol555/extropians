I happened to find the reference I was thinking of.  It was a brief<br>
12/02/95 Science News article called "Brain Scans Set Sights On Mind+s<br>
Eye" that summarized PET scan studies by psychologist Stephen M. Kosslyn<br>
and colleagues at Harvard that was reported more fully in the 30 Nov 95<br>
issue of Nature.<br>
<p>
Here are a couple of snips from the Science News piece:<br>
<p>
Stephen M. Kosslyn: "The fact that stored visual information can affect<br>
processing in the earliest visual areas suggests that knowledge can<br>
fundamentally [influence] what one sees."<br>
<p>
Larry R. Squire, a neuroscientist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center<br>
in San Diego, commenting on Kosslyn+s work: "This is a nice<br>
demonstration that the visual cortex is activated by mental images in<br>
the same ways it would be activated by visual perceptions."<br>
