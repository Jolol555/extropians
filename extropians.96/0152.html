	In 1967, when I was a student at Bishop Dagwell Hall (now called<br>
 Oregon Episcopal Schools), our science teacher, Mr. Morin, asked us to<br>
 each write a ten page paper on anything we wanted to, as long as it<br>
 involved science.<br>
<p>
	This was shortly after Star Trek had debuted on television, and a<br>
 central attraction was the teleporter (“beam me up, Scotty”), a<br>
 concept I was already quite familiar with as an avid science fiction<br>
 reader. So I decided, during that class hour, to examine ways in which<br>
 a teleportation device might be constructed. Most of the content of<br>
 the paper was outlined in that same hour.<br>
<p>
	The main idea looked at was to 3D raster scan (“like with<br>
 television”) an object while disassembling it into its atomic<br>
 components, and create a data file of the structure on the fly. The<br>
 atoms were then accelerated by a particle accelerator, while the data<br>
 file was sent by radio.<br>
<p>
 	At the receiving end, another particle accelerator running in<br>
 reverse would decelerate the atoms. A radio receiver and computer took<br>
 the incoming data file, and used it to reassemble the object,<br>
 atom-by-atom.<br>
<p>
	And so, the idea of assembling atoms by design hardly requires a <br>
Ph.D. to conceive. It is in fact something a twelve-year-old could come <br>
with.<br>
