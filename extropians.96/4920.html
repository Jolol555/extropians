Alt.chrome.the.moon was initiated to overcome the problem of moon's  poor <br>
albedo: though chrome absorbs intensively in IR, the reflectance spectrum<br>
in the visible is quite flat. (Of course aluminum/silicon is pretty <br>
lustrous as well, no need to take chroming literally).<br>

But a signet needs not to contain fine print, the corporate identity of <br>
"Coca Cola" is easily visible even on a thumbnail. (I must admit I am <br>
just being silly, putting advertisements on the moon would be just a side <br>
effect of applied selenology, not an ends in itself).<br>

You can increase the albedo, and dynamically track the reflectors, as well.<br>

<p>
What would you do, if we started mining the moon? "Chroming" the moon <br>
(covering it with solar collectors) in the course of a few decades won't <br>
look pretty -- but we need the resources.<br>
<p>

<p>
Insects navigate by the moon, that's the reason why their system gets <br>
screwed up by lanterns. I don't think we have any other choice than mining <br>
the moon, though, so the question is quite academic. See rainforests.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the last straw.  How many species might not be able to mate if there were</i><br>

<i>&gt; Go play your games with the moon over a manmade planet.</i><br>

Planets are pointless, unless disassembled.<br>

P.S. Apart from the poets/lovers there are members of an another <br>
profession,  clamoring about polluting the skies with light. Astronomers <br>
do not rage against the dying of the light, no, quite vice versa. First <br>
the advent of these sodium and mercury lights, which foul up spectroscopy, <br>
then it is the threat of luminous hardware hanging in the skies, as some <br>
Russians proposed to illuminate their tundra cities, simply outrageous!<br>
