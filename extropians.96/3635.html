<p>
Absolutely.  But even entry-level programmers understand how to use the<br>
basic constructs of programming and data structures.  I believe any<br>
"serious" development environment must assume at least this level of knowledge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My impression is that the primary goal of object-oriented development </i><br>

<i>&gt;create reusable, general-purpose objects that can be easily extended to </i><br>

<i>&gt;complexity as possible.  Portability and simplicity of maintainance (mostly </i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning cheap, entry-level programmers wherever possible) is far more </i><br>
<i>&gt;important than performance for these types of applications (which still </i><br>
<i>&gt;account for the bulk of the world's computing, though that is changing ;)</i><br>
<p>
This is exactly correct.  C++ allows you to simplify the environment as much<br>
as possible without losing any of the flexibility of the language.  I think<br>
this is the way it is supposed to be.<br>
<p>
I am not advocating complexity.  I am advocating the ability to access the<br>
system at any level of complexity you desire or require.  Complexity is also<br>
a subjective and relative term.  C is a more complex language than assembly<br>
code.  But assembly code programming is generally considered more complex<br>
than C programming primarily because the language is simpler.  I haven't met<br>
a language (and I know about a dozen) that I would consider truly complex.<br>
They only seem complex if you don't know that much about programming.  (Of<br>
course, there are a couple bastard languages that stand as exceptions, but<br>
we will ignore these.)<br>
<p>
And for the record, I usually program at a high level for development cycle<br>
efficiency.  Let the hardware make up for the performance loss ;)<br>
