We now know from experiments on Bell's inequality that if hidden variables<br>

Einstein had in mind, they can't be local. Also, drinking a cup of coffee<br>

                 <br>
Not all particles have this property (photons) but you are correct, atoms do.<br>
It's called The Pauli Exclusion Principle.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Their "individuality" is based on spacial location.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's interesting that the Pauli Exclusion Principle can only be derived, in<br>
fact it only makes sense, if we use an obscure idea in pure Philosophy, and<br>
assume the exact opposite of what you say above. In 1690 the philosopher and<br>
co-inventor of The Calculus, Leibniz, wrote about something he called<br>
" The Identity Of Indiscernibles ". He said that things that you can measure<br>
are what's important, and if there is no way to find a difference between two<br>
things then they are identical and switching the position of the objects does<br>
not change the physical state of the system. Until this century few thought<br>
this idea was important, nobody thought it had observable consequences,<br>
because nobody could find two things that were exactly alike. Things changed<br>
dramatically when it was discovered that atoms have no scratches on them to<br>
tell them apart.<br>
<p>
The Schrodinger Wave Equation is one of the first and greatest discoveries in<br>
Quantum Mechanics. It proved to be enormously useful in accurately predicting<br>
the results of experiments, and as the name implies it's an equation<br>
describing the movement of a wave, but embarrassingly it was not at all clear<br>
what it was talking about. Exactly what was waving? Schrodinger thought it<br>
was a matter wave, but that didn't seem right to Max Born. Born reasoned that<br>
matter is not smeared around, only the probability of finding it is. Born was<br>
correct, whenever an electron is detected it always acts like a particle, it<br>
makes a dot when it hit's a phosphorus screen not a smudge, however the<br>
probability of finding that electron does act like a wave so you can't be<br>
certain exactly where that dot will be. Born showed that it's the square of<br>
the wave equation that describes the probability, the wave equation itself is<br>
sort of a useful mathematical fiction, like lines of longitude and latitude,<br>
because experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a<br>
particle, we can only measure the intensity (square) of the wave function<br>
[F(x)]^2 because that's a probability and probability we can measure.<br>
<p>
Let's consider a very simple system with lots of space but only 2 particles<br>
in it.  P(x) is the probability of finding two particles x  distance apart,<br>
and we know that probability is the square of the wave function, so<br>
P(x) =[F(x)]^2. Now let's exchange the position of the particles in the<br>
system, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x but is now x2 - x1 = -x.<br>
 <br>
The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the two particles are<br>
the same, no measurable change has been made, no change in probability,<br>
so P(x) = P(-x). Probability is just the square of the wave function so<br>
[ F(x) ]^2 = [F(-x)]^2 . From this we can tell that the Quantum wave function<br>
can be either an even function, F(x) = +F(-x), or an odd function,<br>
F(x) = -F(-x). Either type of function would work in our probability equation<br>
because the square of minus 1 is equal to the square of plus 1. It turns out<br>
both solutions have physical significance, particles with integer spin,<br>
Bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half integer spin, Fermions,<br>
have odd wave functions.<br>
<p>
If we put two Fermions like electrons in the same place then the distance<br>
between them, x , is zero and because they must follow the laws of odd wave<br>
functions, F(0)  = -F(0), but the only number that is its own negative is<br>
zero so  F(0)  =0 . What this means is that the wave function F(x) goes to<br>
zero so of course  [F(x)]^2 goes to zero, thus the probability of finding two<br>
electrons in the same spot is zero, and that is The Pauli Exclusion Principle.<br>
<p>
Two identical bosons, like photons of light, can sit on top of each other but<br>
not so for fermions, The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells us that 2 identical<br>
electrons can not be in the same orbit in an atom. If we didn't know that<br>
then we wouldn't understand Chemistry, we wouldn't know why matter is rigid<br>
and not infinitely compressible, and if we didn't know that atoms are<br>
interchangeable we wouldn't understand any of that.<br>
