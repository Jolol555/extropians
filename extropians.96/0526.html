<i>&gt;the authority of your own argument, I'm sure he'll post.</i><br>
<p>
Why are you taking such offense? I'm asking politely. I only aimed my<br>
message to Max because he is our public spokesperson/representative where<br>
the mass media is concerned. Every group MUST have a leader to inspire the<br>
mindless lemmingish masses. That is until people become more educated via<br>
technology. In the eyes of the public as yet, Max is the "central extropian<br>
authority". Ok, Fine I'll ask Wade myself but mainly because I REALLY want<br>
him to post and also because Max is SOOO busy which I later realized. The<br>
reason I asked Max to tell him to post is because I believe Max could help<br>
inspire him because he enjoys Wade's posts so much.<br>
