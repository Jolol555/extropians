I'm not sure I see much difference between what you are saying and the<br>
conventional belief that there is "God" and there is "free will."<br>
<p>
I would cast things a bit differently.  I believe there are laws of nature<br>
and that they extend into questions of morality.  I think the purpose of<br>
life is to understand and employ those laws.  I am not ready to rule out<br>
the possibility that, by doing so, we will one day rule the universe.<br>
<p>
(Notice that technology permits us to do things today that once seemed<br>
impossible.  Yet we have achieved these things not by denying the laws of<br>
nature, but by better and more fully comprehending them.)<br>
<p>
It seems unfortunate to me that people tend to believe that either a) there<br>
is a God whom they must obey because if they don't he/she will punish them<br>
later, or b) there is no God and therefore no "higher law."<br>
<p>
In other words, I believe it is possible to believe in a higher law without<br>
believing in a higher being.<br>
<p>
This has resulted in a philosophy which may shock some of you.  When I was<br>
twenty years old I wasted much time arguing with "believers."  I was never<br>
able to dissuade any of them (although I have heard it has been done).<br>
Today, my philosophy is that if you are truly comfortable as an atheist you<br>
will not require that everyone else be an atheist.  In fact, if I had to<br>
choose between everyone being an atheist and no one believing in objective<br>
morality, on one hand, and everyone believing in God and objective morality<br>
on the other, I would rather be the only atheist on earth.<br>
