I've just been catching up on physics via the preprint archive at<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a>, and found two papers that might be of interest.<br>
(How to interpret the preprint numbers: a paper like trans-tech/991201<br>
would be found at <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/trans-tech/991201">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/trans-tech/991201</a>.)<br>
<p>
(i) "Topics in quantum computers" by D.P. DiVincenzio (cond-mat/9612126)<br>
This paper proposes a list of minimal requirements for creating a quantum <br>
computer, which might be summarized as<br>
<p>
1) States in a Hilbert space used to encode information (in "qubits")<br>
2) The computer can be placed in some desired starting state<br>
  (e.g. a ground state, reached by cooling)<br>
3) Isolation - the computer must not become quantum-entangled <br>
  with its environment to any great degree<br>
4) Specified pairs of qubits can be entangled as required <br>
  (quantum-computer algorithms are sequences of such operations)<br>
5) The computer can be subjected to a "strong" measurement<br>
  (the "textbook" kind, which projects the computer's wavefunction<br>
  into an eigenstate of some observable)<br>
<p>
The operations in 4) are the computations, the measurement in 5) <br>
I think is the read-out.<br>
<p>
DiVincenzio mentions the "linear ion trap" of Cirac and Zoller<br>
(Phys Rev Lett 74 (1995), pp4091-4094; described in quant-ph/9608011)<br>
as an existing system which satisfies all his criteria to some degree.<br>
<p>
(ii) "M Theory As A Matrix Model: A Conjecture" by T. Banks, W. Fischler,  <br>
S.H. Shenker, L. Susskind (hep-th/9610043).<br>
<p>
M theory is the theory believed to underlie all the string theories.<br>
Prior to this paper, so far as I know, noone had a concrete proposal<br>
for the exact equations of M theory, just circumstantial evidence<br>
regarding its general form. So if this conjecture is correct it's<br>
a major advance.<br>
<p>
The conjecture is that M theory "in the infinite momentum frame" is <br>
equivalent to "the N=infinity limit of the supersymmetric matrix quantum <br>
mechanics describing D0 branes." I have yet to get a grip on what the<br>
latter refers to, although my impression is that matrix models are<br>
a class of field theories in which the fields are matrix-valued.<br>
<p>
In any case, BFSS write that the theory features "the emergence of field <br>
theory as an approximation to an elegant finite structure". So this may<br>
finally be a TOE which deals in bits rather than continua. They also write:<br>
<p>
"If the conjecture is correct, [...] in principle, with a sufficiently big <br>
and fast computer any scattering amplitude could be computed in the finite <br>
N matrix model with arbitrary precision. Numerical extrapolation to <br>
infinite N is in principle, if not in practice, possible."<br>
<p>
So the theory is computable, but the computations would be practically<br>
impossible using existing methods. Perhaps we'll end up using quantum<br>
computers to extract predictions from M theory!<br>
<p>
(iii) While I'm talking about computers, a comment on Intel's<br>
announcement that it's built a teraflop (trillion operations per second)<br>
computer (<a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/cn121796.htm">http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/cn121796.htm</a>):<br>
wasn't this achieved by a computer in Japan earlier in 1996?<br>
