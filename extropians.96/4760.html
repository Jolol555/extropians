<i>&gt;Thats right. But currently we are in an era of exponential growth and i</i><br>
<i>&gt;think that makes all of the difference. It is now more important than ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be aware that not to many get left behind.</i><br>
<p>
I'm with you on the basic thought, but could you please explain what <br>
specific technologies you refer to when you speak of "exponential growth"?  <br>
It seems that, depending on the set of technologies involved, you <br>
could assert either that (i) they are developing at a rate that will <br>
outpace the means of 'the masses' to eventually acquire them, or (ii) <br>
'the masses' are acquiring new technologies at an exponentially <br>
faster rate.<br>
