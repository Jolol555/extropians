<i>&gt; &gt; centrifugal force extracted as thrust. I have it, and thats my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; secret....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For the love of Pete, why can't you just bloody well say so on your Web</i><br>
<i>&gt; page, instead of sending us off on a wild goose chase?  Just note on</i><br>
<i>&gt; your Web page:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The key to this mechanism is the method of accelerating and slowing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; circling balls.  If this was done by normal means, the total thrust</i><br>
<i>&gt; would cancel out.  I refuse to tell you how it works."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Look, Mike, if you can impart forwards momentum to the balls without</i><br>
<i>&gt; disturbing the rest of the system, what the hell's the cylinder for?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Take the damn thing out and apply force to the balls directly, then let</i><br>
<i>&gt; them bounce off a trampoline without this elaborate cylinder thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is all this?  Camouflage?  If you want to keep your drive a secret,</i><br>
<i>&gt; SAY so, don't put up elaborate misleading Web pages designed to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; every physicist within three light years call you a crackpot.  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; say:  "No, I won't tell you how it works."  Mike, somewhere in your</i><br>
<i>&gt; system there's got to be a module where you impart forwards momentum to</i><br>
<i>&gt; something without imparting an equal and opposite backwards momentum.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you've got it, the Lorrey Drive is a success, if not, a failure.  As</i><br>
<i>&gt; far as I can tell, your page does not describe such a module.  At best</i><br>
<i>&gt; it describes an unnecessarily complex way of using the momentum produced</i><br>
<i>&gt; by another module and falsely implies that this is relevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No offense, here, but I've read a work on cranks and you're beginning to</i><br>
<i>&gt; show some symptoms.  You publish a device, I say the device has a flaw,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you claim I used the wrong equation, and then when half the mailing list</i><br>
<i>&gt; chimes in you claim that what you published is totally irrelevant and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the secret lies elsewhere.  This is NOT proper scientific procedure EVEN</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you know what you're doing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I had the opportunity to become a mathematical crank, once.  I thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd disproved Cantor's Diagonal Theorem by pointing out that the finite</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers could be placed into one-to-one correspondence with all subsets</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the powers of two, and thought that the Theorem stated it was not</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible.  Then on one fateful day I actually applied the Theorem and</i><br>
<i>&gt; realized I hadn't taken the possibility of infinite subsets into</i><br>
<i>&gt; account, just the finite ones.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At this point I realized I had two choices.  One, I could decide that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cantor's Diagonal Theorem wasn't true *anyway*, spend the rest of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; life saying so, plague math professors with poorly typed equations, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; become a general mathematical crank.  Two, I could admit I made a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mistake and get on with my life.  Guess which one I chose?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, I was, in fact, wrong.  This has been known to happen to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it has happened to you.  Perhaps it has not.  Certainly I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not want the billionaire inventor of the famous Lorrey Drive to hold a</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal grudge against me.  On the other hand, I don't want to see a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fellow human turn into a crackpot when I could have saved him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In accordance with the scientific method, I hereby propose that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; debate be suspended until such time as Lorrey produces experimental</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence or six months have elapsed, whichever comes first.  If at this</i><br>
<i>&gt; time Lorrey is the possessor of a Nobel Prize or three, I shall</i><br>
<i>&gt; apologize handsomely.  On the other hand, if Lorrey Inc. *fails* to</i><br>
<i>&gt; drive Boeing out of business, Michael Lorrey shall admit he was wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; and get on with his life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it a deal?</i><br>
