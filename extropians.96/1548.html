Sorry, Robin. I thought this was self-evident, but apparently not. IMO<br>
a person/entity with dramatically higher intelligence can invent and<br>
then<br>
use an array of vastly-improved products and processes. These products<br>
and<br>
processes will rapidly and radically affect the economy, but this is a<br>
side-effect. The crucial difference is in the feedback, as the entity<br>
invents and implements additional intelligence-augmenting devices,<br>
algorithms,<br>
and processes.<br>
<p>
All humans except for those with a fairly severe brain damage fall into<br>
a<br>
narrow range of intelligence, when measured against, say, other primates<br>
or<br>
all other beings on the planet. IMO, an entity who is smarter than the<br>
average human<br>
by the amount that the average human is smarter than the average chimp,<br>
will<br>
be able to take over the world. But this level of intelligence is likely<br>
to<br>
be rapidly achievable shortly after we figure out how to use computers<br>
to<br>
augment an entity's intelligence at all.<br>
<p>
You may argue that the industrial revolution is an analogy. At that<br>
point, we<br>
began to use machines to produce machines. That did in fact produce<br>
fairly radical<br>
changes in the economy and in society over a historically short period.<br>
The<br>
same thing happened again after WWII in the US with the automobile, and<br>
is happening<br>
again (so far to a lesser extent, IMO), with computers replacing clerks. <br>
intelligence augmentation has the potential to happen in a much shorter<br>
time.<br>
I think the economy will fail to adjust to the distortions as gracefully<br>
as<br>
it did to the earlier ones because of this difference in time scales.<br>
