} &gt;Do you take only box B, figuring that you'll get the million dollars<br>
} &gt;that will be there?<br>
} <br>
} &gt;Or do you take both boxes... on the theory that Omega has made his<br>
} &gt;prediction and left, so you can't possibly get LESS money by taking both<br>
} &gt;boxes?<br>
<p>
Actually, when in situations like this one, or the iocaine powder<br>
"battle of wits" in _The Princess Bride_ -- whenever you're in such a<br>
recursion with no brake "she knows I'd do the opposite so maybe she's<br>
seeming to make me do the opposite of what she wants -- but maybe she<br>
figured I'd realize this..." one should flip a coin.  This breaks the<br>
cycle.  Of course in the given case, if the Power is supposed to know<br>
you so well, it would probably have avoided you like the plague.  And<br>
this wouldn't have helped in _The Princess Bride_.<br>
<p>
Actually, since I don't see a physical basis for true "free will", if<br>
you truly are unpredictable it probably comes down to flipping a coin<br>
somehow anyway.<br>

Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without<br>
difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton beginning to talk to him.<br>
