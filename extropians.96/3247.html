        Before I get to the reason of this post, I must say how nice it is<br>
to see the latest written artwork\poetry that has been appearing much more<br>
frequently on this list.  I urge everyone who has any presentable artwork to<br>
present it...both to the list and anywhere possible.  This is one sure way<br>
of increasing people's interest and knowledge of our philosophy.  As I said<br>
in a post about six weeks ago, if the average person sees artwork that they<br>
like, they are bound to query it and look into it further.  There are<br>
millions upon millions of people who would warm to extropy and transhumanism<br>
if it was presented to them...art is a great way to do this.<br>
<p>
        Anyway, here is the crux of the post --a poem I wrote about a week<br>
ago.  It was heavily inspired by a poem by T.S. Eliot called "The Hollow<br>
Men".  When reading this poem, please look at the last two lines in relation<br>
to the whole poem; the lines on their own could appear to hold some<br>
semblance of mysticism.  Enough rambling...<br>

          UNITY<br>
<p>
<p>
I was a young man of eighty-two<br>
When Death took my love from me,<br>
I asked where she did go,<br>
He replied: "o'er the sea";<br>
With nary a second glance<br>
The two, they disappeared,<br>
And I doggedly made a vow<br>
That I would cheat the force I feared;<br>
Determined, I set my plans<br>
To live an eternity,<br>
Invested in many kinds<br>
Of extension technology;<br>
When I reached one hundred and five<br>
I saw immortality on the brink,<br>
Machines to help me live,<br>
Computers to help me think;<br>
Gradually I was restored<br>
To the equivalence of youth,<br>
With my consciousness unimpaired<br>
And the knowledge of a simple truth;<br>
At the age of one forty-six<br>
I am really only a child,<br>
With so much more to learn,<br>
My Life has me beguiled;<br>
My love has long been dead,<br>
Long been o'er the sea,<br>
But the memory of her Life<br>
Forever lives inside of me<br>
For I know I have cheated Death,<br>
Beat Him at His own game,<br>
I have seen the beautiful truth:<br>
Death and Life are one and the same<br>
