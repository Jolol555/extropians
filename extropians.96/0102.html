From: arkuat@factory.net (Eric Watt Forste)<br>
<i>&gt;But there are many extrinsic subgoals that generalize very nicely across an</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely broad set of permissible end-goals (the intrinsic ones). So if I</i><br>
<i>&gt;whimsically decide to constrain my goals to accord to natural law (I decide</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not interested in killing and plundering), then no matter what my</i><br>
<i>&gt;idiosyncratic goals are within the remaining goal-universe, I can serve</i><br>
<i>&gt;those ends indirectly by working towards increasing my understanding of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world and increasing the harmony of my relationships with others ...</i><br>
<p>
Thanks!  Makes sense, with a few fuzzy spots that probably stem from<br>
my own ignorance.  I like the idea that the next step in a long term<br>
plan to accomplish a goal doesn't change much when you change the<br>
goal.  I'm not too clear on the distinction between extrinsic and<br>
intrinsic goals, though.<br>
<p>
I think I make a smaller whimsical decision than you do.  If I run<br>
around chopping off people's heads, then eventually they'll get<br>
together and stop me, probably by doing something functionally<br>
equivalent to chopping off my head.  (We're talking unfriendly human<br>
interaction here, not neurosuspension.  :-) Thus running around<br>
chopping off people's heads isn't part of any long-term plan.  So<br>
instead of whimsically deciding to constrain your goals to accord to<br>
natural law, you can whimsically decide to have a long-term plan.<br>
This (to me) feels like a smaller assumption, especially because I<br>
don't know what you mean by "natural law".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why does the "natural law" mark off the non-permissible goals? Because</i><br>
<i>&gt;those goals are generalizably disextrinsic... they tend to work against the</i><br>
<i>&gt;attainment of any of the much larger set of possible goals not forbidden by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "natural law". But the problem of making the demarcation precise is</i><br>
<i>&gt;still a hard one, though some good work has been done recently (e. g.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gauthier).</i><br>
<p>
Sounds interesting.  Can you post a reference?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Tim<br>
