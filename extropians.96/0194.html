The following is a portion of a message I received defining the fear of <br>
a negative impact upon the Christian meme resulting from the possible <br>
discovery of life on Mars. It may be of interest/amusement to extropians. <br>

<i>&gt; From: Alan Morrison &lt;101234.1005@CompuServe.COM&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To: BlindCopyReceiver:;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Fossilised Detritus...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dear Friends:</i><br>
<i>&gt; The front page of almost every U.K. newspaper today (7 August 1996) </i><br>
<i>&gt; contains details of a discovery made by the National Aeronautics and Space </i><br>
<i>&gt; Administration (NASA) that a fossil embedded in a meteorite found in </i><br>
<i>&gt; Antarctica in 1984 allegedly provides, according to NASA spokesman James </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hartsfield, "chemical evidence of past biological activity on Mars".  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Full details of the "discovery" will appear in the next published edition </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the U.S. journal "Science".  I am sending this message out this morning </i><br>
<i>&gt; (even prior to the official announcement which will be made later today) </i><br>
<i>&gt; because of the gargantuan importance of this event for the Christian Church.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It so happens that for the past few weeks I have been writing an article </i><br>
<i>&gt; for consumption in the mainstream Christian press on this very subject of </i><br>
<i>&gt; aliens and UFOs.  Today's announcement represents a major part in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; strategy of New World Order revelation in this area.  Three years ago </i><br>
<i>&gt; in my book, "The Serpent and the Cross", I made the following statement:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;"The increasing number of UFO sightings has nothing to do with genuine</i><br>
<i>&gt; extra-terrestrial civilisations, but is part of an ongoing strategy of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; powers of darkness (Eph.6:12), under the direction of their prince of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; power of the air (Eph.2:2), who are engaged in convincing the minds of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; gullible that something out there is trying to contact us.  To those whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds are attuned to such contact, demonic beings will actually manifest</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves as benign extra-terrestrials (ETs) who wish to offer help to</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanity -- an offer that will, if it presents itself more openly, be avidly</i><br>
<i>&gt; received as the influence of the New Gnosticism develops in world culture.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If it can be proven that ETs do exist, and that they are on a higher </i><br>
<i>&gt; plane t han the inhabitants of planet Earth, this will go a long way </i><br>
<i>&gt; towards vindicating the claims of the Neo-Gnostics, as well as establishing </i><br>
<i>&gt; the suppositions of the New Physics and the evolutionary theories of secular </i><br>
<i>&gt; humanism.  If this was to be supplemented by an alleged scientific </i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery of the secret of the life-force, the way would be paved for </i><br>
<i>&gt; some truly cataclysmic changes on this planet.  We should not be at </i><br>
<i>&gt; all surprised if these developments occur in the near future as part </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the advancing strategy of the powers of darkness to discredit the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Gospel, debunk the Bible, and eradicate the concept of a transcendent </i><br>
<i>&gt; Creator God.  The world will then be ready to believe the Lie which </i><br>
<i>&gt; Satan has always sought to perpetuate, and the global conditions will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; in place for the revealing of the ultimate Man of Sin (2 Th.2:3-12)." </i><br>
<i>&gt; [end of quote]&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 [ snipped about 5 pages of the same ]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ultimately, it is all yet more confirmation of the veracity of </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bible prophecy!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's just so obvious, in fact, it proves that the anti-Chirst is on the <br>
way; isn't the Bible just amazing, gee whiz. Notice, the attempt to turn<br>
evidence against biblical B.S. into evidence for it: the Big Lie 101, or <br>
Memetic Preservation 101.<br>
<p>

Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)<br>
<p>
Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A<br>
