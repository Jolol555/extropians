<i>&gt;Hal Finney writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Now Brin himself has come out seriously proposing that privacy is evil,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and that we should restructure society to prevent it!</i><br>
<p>
This is, of course, a profoundly and willfully tendentious statement,<br>
diametrically opposed to what I really believe, and to what I said.<br>
<p>
One critical trait shown by mature disputants is a sincere effort to<br>
accurately paraphrase their opponents, showing thus that they understand<br>
what they are criticizing.  Sadly, most self-righteous polemicists prefer<br>
exaggerating and demonizing instead, turning adversaries into carricatures.<br>
It feels good, you see.  Ooooh, it feels so good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I think it is such a totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;misguided notion that it was hard even to find ground to discuss it.</i><br>
<p>
Note the difference between Finney's approach and Hanson's (below).  Hanson<br>
does two things that mature grownups do in conversation.  (1) He tries to<br>
paraphrase me accurately, even in those areas he questions or disagrees<br>
with.  (2) He asks questions and tries to narrow down specific points his<br>
opponent (me) ought to clarify.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let me defend Brin.  The main point he is making is that a huge loss</i><br>
<i>&gt;in privacy is inevitable, and we need to start addressing this fact ASAP.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe crypto will allow certain kinds of privacy that weren't possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;before, but to see this as leading to a "golden age of privacy" is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;tragically miss the big picture.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now let me criticize Brin.  In his 12/96 Wired article Brin is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently clear about what our choices are, nor does he</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently defend his claims about choices.  Brin says that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;inevitable that most of us will be viewed by cameras while we walk</i><br>
<i>&gt;about in public, and "the proliferation of vast databases ... about</i><br>
<i>&gt;our lives, habits, tastes, and personal histories."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But he says we can still choose whether or not the public knows that</i><br>
<i>&gt;they are so watched, whether there are cameras in police stations, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether cameras are banned from many indoor places.  Brin claims that</i><br>
<i>&gt;if we choose to have privacy laws, the consequence of such a choice</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be "to prevent you and me from learning anything about the rich</i><br>
<i>&gt;and powerful".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The obvious question is: why are these the choices?  Why is the one</i><br>
<i>&gt;set open to change and the other set not?  Without hearing some</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasoning in defense of this division, it is hard to take Brin's</i><br>
<i>&gt;analysis very seriously.</i><br>
<p>
Alas, I find Robin's question opaque.  I read it several times and can see<br>
he was trying to set me a clear question, but it just doesn't register.<br>
What, specifically, is he trying to ask.  Help?<br>
<p>
Let me try a couple of things and see if they satisfy him.<br>
<p>
In fact, I have stated repeatedly and clearly that I love my own privacy<br>
and strive to protect it.  However I also see the inevitability of its<br>
decay as the rich, mighty, and a techno-elite gain powers I can never hope<br>
to match.  Faced with the inevitable futility of wearing armor plate, I ask<br>
to be armed with a light saber, for my own freedom and safety's sake.<br>
<p>
Every tyranny in history based its power first and foremost on denying<br>
outsiders the ability to see the in-group's machinations.  We all<br>
instinctively fear this, and so each political wedge in society strives to<br>
deny secrecy to its foes, whom they perceive as scheming conspirators.<br>
(Finney certainly feels this way about government agencies, for instance,<br>
and supports all the secrecy-denying tools we have imposed on bureaucrats,<br>
from the Freedom of Info act to open meetings laws, etc.  He does not see<br>
this as denying them 'privacy', naturally.  They are his enemies and don't<br>
deserve any!)<br>
<p>
Likewise, a person of the moderate left, who worries about conspiratorial<br>
oligarchs, might want similar windows into the secretive inner world of<br>
corporate management, where cheating and capricious abuses of power are<br>
rampant.  Am I right in positing that Finney would defend to the death the<br>
right of these lords of capital to evade scrutiny, even though<br>
conspiratorial aristocrats destroyed more freedom in history than<br>
bureaucrats ever have?  Too bad, Ben. The recent Texaco Tapes scandal shows<br>
that the electronic light is starting to shine into boardrooms, as video<br>
cameras shine on cops, etc.<br>
<p>
(In other words, the Transparent Society MAY happen without us having to do<br>
anything at all.  It may be inevitable.  But I tend to be suspicious of<br>
teleology, so let's continue.)<br>
<p>
Oddly enough, the only power center to be COOPERATIVE about increased<br>
openness has been the federal government, which yearly opens more of its<br>
deliberations and processes to public view, an irony the cypherpunks seem<br>
incapable of perceiving.<br>
<p>
Their inability to see the hypocritical dilemma of privacy fetishism (i.e.<br>
I get to look at my enemies but don't you DARE look at me!) is augmented by<br>
the silliness of their claim to be brave, lonely rebels... when in fact<br>
privacy fetishism is THE mass lemming political movement of the decade,<br>
with nearly every self-righteous voice of left, right, up, down and silly<br>
chanting the same rote mantra.<br>
<p>
In fact, they cannot cite a single example from human history in which<br>
freedom was enhanced by selling masks and chadors to the poor.  But you<br>
point to ANY occasion when freedom increased in the world, and I'll show<br>
that it happened in direct correlation with increased ability by the masses<br>
to see what the mighty were doing.   Zero percent versus 100 percent is<br>
pretty damn devastating.  As a protection of freedom, secrecy is no match<br>
for transparency.<br>
<p>
In truth, I see myself as a moderate on this issue, raising questions and<br>
suggesting only that candor and transparency be included in the discussion.<br>
How sad that this mild approach makes me seen as an extremist!  It shows<br>
how tilted the debate has been until now.<br>
<p>
Robin, I do not insist that these are the only choices.  I maintain only<br>
that the mighty have a window of opportunity in which they MAY be able to<br>
set up barriers against light.  Barriers that you and I cannot hope to<br>
match, no matter how many PGP programs the cypherpunks tout.  WE will live<br>
in glass houses, like it or not.  All I am asking is whether we should act<br>
to make sure the powerful (of all types) do also.<br>
<p>
I welcome further thoughts as the book develops. (I'll be on Wired Online<br>
2pm pst December 12.)<br>
<p>
Best wishes,<br>
<p>
David Brin<br>
