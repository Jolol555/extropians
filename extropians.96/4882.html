 A very thought provoking post. This brings to mind the old story that<br>
goes around the scifi fanways about a bet between Heinlein and Hubbard<br>
as to who could found a more powerful religion with one book. Heinlein<br>
went off and wrote "Stranger in a Strange Land" and started the sexual<br>
revolution, while Hubbard dusted off the old Dianetics meme and founded<br>
the Scientologists. Heinlein, who could have had a more powerful impact<br>
on our society, rejected the role of guru, so far as to have "water<br>
grokkers" camping on his front lawn arrested, while old L Ron reveled in<br>
the worship of adoring nuts...<br>
<p>
Campbell, seeing all this, was exasperated.....<br>

I like your concept of dieties being virulent complex memeplexes. The<br>
major disadvantage we have with developing similar systems is TIME. If<br>
history is essentially over within 30-50 years, we have little hope of<br>
starting anything big in that time. However, by acting as the prophets<br>
and apostles of extropian memes, recording how it was that the human<br>
SIngularity came about, we will serve as the authors of whatever texts<br>
will become the sacred histories in the transhuman tomorrow. Thus we can<br>
act now in devising memes that will be useful tools for the minimization<br>
of entropy and maximization of extropy for individuals to refer to for<br>
self actualization in a transhuman society, much as the Psalms or other<br>
parts of the old books have been referred to in scholarly and legal<br>
works throughout the enlightenment.<br>
