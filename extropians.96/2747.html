<i>&gt; After reading my post on the unlikelyhood of "universal translators" and being</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to communicate with aliens, and a brief explaination of the basis for</i><br>
<i>&gt; human communication, Michael Lorrey commented:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Sorry Dave, that sounds like psychomystical claptrap to me. The fact is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; using mathematics, and our knowledge of the physical laws, we already have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rosetta Stone to relate with any technological society of aliens. If they were</i><br>
<i>&gt; non technological, I'm not sure it would be so easy. The fact that we would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; two intelligent races with scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes for a huge overlap of common ground from which to build greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First of all, what aspects of my post make it sound like "psychomystical</i><br>
<i>&gt; claptrap"?  I think the concept of resonance between systems (broadly meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they cause each other to behave similarly) is a farily scientific concept</i><br>
<i>&gt; (tuning forks are the classic example).  The idea the humans mimic each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a matter of observable fact.  I don't see anything in my post that I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine someone could see as "psychomystical claptrap".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I understand what you're saying about the Rosetta Stone and using our common</i><br>
<i>&gt; base of scientific knowledge to develop forms of communication with aliens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I can conceive of possible alien beings who are technologically</i><br>
<i>&gt; advanced and who have a very good understanding of the regularities of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe (the knowledge that we discover through science), but whose concepts</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ways of thinking are still profoundly different than ours.  I am thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt; that our way of doing science and finding out how the universe works is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of many ways to approach understanding the universe.  It may be that our</i><br>
<i>&gt; science is simply a way that is especially well suited to the human brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This is the psychomystical claptrap. The idea that there is any other<br>
kind of science than science, or other kind of mathermatics than math,<br>
or that another race may have different table of the elements. This is<br>
the sort of stuff you see in tabloids, but not among intelligent people.<br>
<p>
If they are technological, they can only do so according to the physical<br>
laws, and even though we may not have discovered them all yet, we still<br>
have enough knowledge to relate pretty closely, at least on our level.<br>
If they were a superior species, they would obviously understand our<br>
limitations and "stoop" to our level of understanding.<br>
<p>
If they are technological, they are mor likely to have similar modes of<br>
thinking than not. We have been using technology of various levels since<br>
we got out of the trees, so it has had the most impact on the evolution<br>
of our brains than anything since we got these big things.<br>
 It only follows that a specied that developed technology would have<br>
gone through the same evolutionary process, according to the same<br>
physical laws, and developed similar modes of thinking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I imagine that alien beings would have developed their own, unique ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing accurate knowledge, which would likely be profoundly different from</i><br>
<i>&gt; our own.  They may come to understand the various properties of the different</i><br>
<i>&gt; elements and learn how to take advantage of those properties, but the way they</i><br>
<i>&gt; organize their knowledge and represent it to each other may be quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; profoundly different from our Periodic Table of the Elements.  </i><br>
<p>
There is only ONE table of the elements, we didn't invent it, we<br>
discovered it, and have only been filling in the blanks.<br>
<p>
<p>
It makes sense<br>
<i>&gt; to us to arrange all the elements on a chart, grouped according to similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; properties and in order of atomic weight, but it only makes sense because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the particular ways that we have developed to think about things.  Evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; on a different planet would likely yield intelligent beings with very</i><br>
<i>&gt; different ways of thinking about things and approaching things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Humans seem to have a hard time imagining that intelligent beings might think</i><br>
<i>&gt; in ways profoundly different than we do.  We tend to think that our way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence is the only way.  It's difficult to imagine other ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking; they are too alien to our minds.  Humans also tend to  imagine that</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent aliens will be humanoid in shape, or something reasonably similar.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  We have a hard time imagining intelligent beings in shapes *very* different</i><br>
<i>&gt; than our own.</i><br>
<p>
So far, out of the three or more races here on the planet that should<br>
have the capacity to be intelligent, we are the only ones to develop<br>
technology, so it follows that other technological races would be more<br>
similar to us than say, a dolphin.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then there's the question of how the aliens would likely communicate with each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other.  Would they vibrate the air, like we do?  Perhaps they would make</i><br>
<i>&gt; intricate bodily movements and use some kind of sonar to observe each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; move.  Perhaps they will have ways of communicating massive amounts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; information in parallel, rather than in a stream, like we do.  Maybe they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have developed some sort of technology so that they stimulate each other's</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds more directly, and their communications would be so subtle that we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider it telepathy.  Their forms of communication may be so profoundly</i><br>
<i>&gt; different than ours, and their ways of representing knowledge in their minds</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be so profoundly different, that even if they understand the basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; properties of the universe to the degree we do and have the same basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge, we wouldn't be able to recognize how they've encoded that knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; because we wouldn't understand how they even communicate knowledge to each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other.  If their knowledge is being communicated between each of the aliens by</i><br>
<i>&gt; subtle technological links between their minds, then it would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to understand the workings of their communication devices, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; would most likely be almost seamlessly integrated with their cognitive organs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
How they communicate is not important as WHAT they communicate. If they<br>
are technological, they will be communicating SCIENCE and MATH. We have<br>
experience with many ways of communication, not just sound, including<br>
the electronic form we are using now and we seem to communicate, though<br>
this seems to illustrate the difference between communication between<br>
technological and nontechnological entities. I'm an engineer, your an<br>
artist (?).  Space traveling aliens are likely to be scientists and<br>
engineers, so my argument stands.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yeah, if they had a periodic chart written down somewhere, then we could</i><br>
<i>&gt; compare it with ours and understand a little of their language, but what if</i><br>
<i>&gt; they don't write anything down?  What if all their communication is</i><br>
<i>&gt; "telepathic"?  </i><br>
<p>
You were asking me about psychomystical claptrap? There it is right<br>
there.<br>
<p>
<p>
How do we crack into their communication systems to even have a<br>
<i>&gt; start at understanding the information that they are passing back and forth?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And then how do we understand what they're "talking" about?  Maybe each of</i><br>
<i>&gt; them has all the properties of physical matter memorized, so they no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; talk about it; they just refer to that set of knowledge with arbitrary</i><br>
<i>&gt; symbols.  Then we would never see their scientific knowledge being</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicated between them, only arbitrary symbols that are meaningful only to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the aliens themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Interpretation happens by using concepts that are shared to equate the<br>
sybols of communication that represent them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Language is an evolved technological device, with symbols pointing to various</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts, which are linked to other concepts with varying degrees of fuzziness</i><br>
<i>&gt; inside each individual's mind.  Language grows as we invent new symbols to</i><br>
<i>&gt; point to our shared concepts and develop new fuzzy links between concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Language grows and evolves very much like an organism.  Minor mutations are</i><br>
<i>&gt; constantly being made to the symbolic structure.  It's also very much like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer program that keeps getting added to and changed here and there until</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is almost unrecognizable compared to what it was and is very complex and</i><br>
<i>&gt; messy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Michael asks, "Who ever said that humans have a  "low" level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I did.  It was right in my post.  Did you not see it? :-)</i><br>
<p>
Yes I did, show me proof. Based on our limited experience, we are the<br>
best communicating race on this planet, otherwize we would not be able<br>
to organize this huge worldwide and soon interplanetary civilization.<br>
<p>
Show me one other species that has done that and I'll concede the point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Humans DO have a low level of communication.  Most of the activities and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoughts occurring in our brains have no representation in our languages.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt; can look at the sky, but can we communicate the color blue? </i><br>
<p>
There you just did, the sky is blue.<br>
<p>
If you were an alien, you would tell me what the wavelength of "blue" is<br>
translated in units measured, probably angstroms, as that is based on<br>
atomic structure, and I would look at that wave length and say HMMMMM<br>
interesting. If we saw in different wavelengths (unlikely for reasons<br>
due to the effects of various radiation on genetic and biological<br>
material) the best we could do is wait until we could graft one of their<br>
types of eyes into one of our people. Using artificianl visual<br>
augmentation, we should be able to "See" in any wavelength.<br>
<p>
 <br>
 No; we can only<br>
<i>&gt; refer the person we are talking to, to their experience of the color blue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When we're communicating with each other, we're basically referring each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; to common, similar memories and experiences.  We can only really communicate</i><br>
<i>&gt; about common experiences and concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, it is extremely difficult for us to communicate with each other about</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences we have in common but which haven't been talked about before, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; no symbols have been developed yet to represent that common experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Various bodily sensations and nuances of emotion are common, mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences for which we haven't yet developed symbols, and so we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; really communicate with each other about these experiences, because we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what sounds or images to make to get the other person to remember the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience we are wanting to refer them to.</i><br>
<p>
We all feel the same, and if one romance writer hasn't described about<br>
every feeling and emotion possible, I haven't heard about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Most of our thoughts have to do mainly with our own specific, individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; memories and experiencs, and these thoughts cannot be shared through language</i><br>
<i>&gt; because only the individual thinking them has the proper background (memories)</i><br>
<i>&gt; to understand those thoughts.</i><br>
<p>
Thats why we communicate, as a form of relation...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you understand what I am saying?  It's very difficult to communicate these</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas well.  Especially since I don't know how much background you have in</i><br>
<i>&gt; these areas, and I don't know how much to explain and how much to assume you</i><br>
<i>&gt; already know.  </i><br>
<p>
You erroneously assume that every human has as much trouble<br>
communicating their thoughts as you do. This has more to do with<br>
education than evolution.<br>
<p>
<p>
I also don't know how you think about things and link up<br>
<i>&gt; concepts, so I don't know if I'm triggering off your concepts in the proper</i><br>
<i>&gt; order so that you form the links that I am trying to get you to form with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Effective communication is very difficult to achieve between humans.  It is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; art that requires much training and practice.</i><br>
<p>
Sure but once you are there, the same rule pretty much apply to any form<br>
of communication.<br>
