<p>
Here's the version sketched in my forthcoming Avon novel THE WHITE ABACUS:<br>
<p>
<p>
`Shortly before they found the hex, a consortium of the ancient nations<br>
started to build a tower reaching into space.'<br>
<p>
`Oh.  A Beanstalk.'  Ratio recognises this concept: a diamond cable<br>
stretching from geostationary orbit to the ground, tethered atop a suitable<br>
equatorial mountain, balanced by a second cable plunging a further 110,000<br>
kilometers into cislunar space.  It was Faustian technology appropriate to<br>
the culture that captured the mass defect and coupled its orbit to Psyche's.<br>
Only poor timing had prevented the Beanstalk's completion.<br>
<p>
`"Spacehook" is how it was normally described,' Cima corrects sem.  `No, the<br>
Hyde Fountain was rather more audacious.'  He sketches in the air, and the<br>
Rozhdestvensky's watchful ai translates his gestures into a schematic holly<br>
display above the table.<br>
<p>
`Fire a stream of nine-kilo aluminum rings up an evacuated tower at 25<br>
klicks a second,' he explains, `and brake them as they rise.'<br>
<p>
The ai is nothing if not quick.  `Ah.  The transferred force will sustain<br>
the tower structure that holds the brake motors,' Ratio sees, nodding.<br>
`It's a reverse mass-driver, fixed to the ground.'<br>
<p>
`Nice, isn't it?  Twitch the little buggers around at the top with more<br>
magnets, and ram them back down.'<br>
<p>
`Reusing the power extracted on the way up, presumably.'<br>
<p>
`Yep.  Send them around a big loop when they get to the ground,' and he<br>
sketches a vast sub-surface ring of superconducting magnets, `pumping the<br>
speed up again, and shoot 'em out for another trip through the circuit.'<br>
<p>
`They'd melt.'<br>
<p>
`Oddly enough, no.  There's energy loss, but it only raises the temperature<br>
of the projectile rings by 40 degrees.  That's dissipated on their return<br>
trip from space.'<br>
<p>
`One would wish to employ a measure of redundancy,' Ratio observes<br>
thoughtfully, `if this process is meant to carry an elevator.' <br>
<p>
`Ah, ai caution!'  Cima laughs gustily.  `Well, yes, even the mad dog hu<br>
engineers thought of that.  Three, four, ten times redundant.  But you can<br>
raise a shaft to geostationary without needing spectacular material<br>
strengths.  No need for diamond fibers.'<br>
<p>
`Even so, it would clearly be a costly venture.'<br>
<p>
`Getting it up, sure.'  Cima sprawls.  His animation display runs in the air<br>
between them, a monstrous Tower of Babel clawing into heaven, a million<br>
aluminum rings hurled up and down and all around.  `Ten terawatts of<br>
circulating power.  Of course, that would've been pumped in incrementally as<br>
the tower was raised.  Even so, it needed 15 gigawatts to keep it running.'<br>
He leans forward, eyes gleaming.  `But it would have given us a permanent<br>
elevator to space, zipping up the tower by magnetic levitation.  Linear<br>
motors.  [snip]<br>
