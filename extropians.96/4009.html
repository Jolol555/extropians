Abstract<br>
<p>
An integrative, comprehensive model of death anxiety is presented. The model<br>
postulates three immediate antecedents of death anxiety: past-related regret,<br>
future-related regret and meaningfulness of death. Past-related regret<br>
refers to<br>
a person's unfulfilled aspirations that should have been achieved but were not.<br>
Future-related regret refers to the anticipation that, as a result of premature<br>
death, one cannot achieve important goals in the future. Meaningfulness of<br>
death<br>
refers to one's concept of death and ability to make sense of it. These three<br>
antecedents are related to death salience in a complex way mediated by coping<br>
mechanisms and their effects on one's beliefs about self and the world. The<br>
coping mechanisms include (but are not necessarily limited to) life review,<br>
life<br>
planning, identification with culture, and self-transcending processes. The<br>
model's developmental and practical applications are explored.<br>
