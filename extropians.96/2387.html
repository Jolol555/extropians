          Yes, but now I am no longer sure exactly what the definition <br>
          (analysis) you propose is. It would be helpful if you could <br>
          express it in the form:<br>
          <br>
          x is art if, and only if, x ---.<br>
          <br>
          What you write in place of the "---" should be (1) clear <br>
          (ideally a physical formula, but that is obviously beyond <br>
          reach in this case), (2) informative (e.g. not --- = "is <br>
          art"), and (3) agree with the notion you are trying to <br>
          define (no counterexamples).<br>
          <br>
          If you are not out for a conceptual analysis but rather for <br>
          an explication, then condition (3) can be somewhat relaxed <br>
          but there will be a new condition to consider: (4) the <br>
          explicandum should be interesting or useful.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          You bet. I'm not knowledgable in the phil of art, however. <br>
          My guess is that some kind of concensus might have emerged <br>
          that the notion of art is a so called family concept, so <br>
          that no consise definition is possible. But then again, <br>
          maybe there is an essential core that you could think out -I <br>
          believe, for example, that I have discovered a nice <br>
          explication of the notion of a paranormal phenomenon (like <br>
          true psychokinesis etc.)<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;What are the philosophers doing these days, anyway?</i><br>
          <br>
          All sorts of things, except thinking about the future. One <br>
          exception is John Leslie with his recent book The End of the <br>
          World. I believe, however, that his main argument is flawed.<br>
