Thanks for mentioning something I see very rarely in print. Though<br>
Women's Liberation has been around for a while now, Men's Liberation is<br>
still in the stone age. There are many many instances where women are<br>
favored over men, especially in the areas of hazardous jobs and just<br>
about anything having to do with child care. I suspect there is no<br>
reconciling the difference between some idea of "fairness" and the<br>
different biological imperatives of men vs women. I suspect our very<br>
idea of "fairness" is strongly modulated by this.<br>
<p>
An interesting read is Michael Hutichinson's "The Anatomy of Sex and<br>
Power". A point made there is that the investment in offspring for women<br>
is much greater than that for men. A woman has to protect the children<br>
until they reach reproductive age. When dealing with danger and<br>
confrontation it is a bad strategy for a woman to actually become<br>
exposed directly to danger for if the woman dies, so do the children. So<br>
the female strategy is to have others, (men) actually confront the<br>
dangers, for if the men die, the children will survive along with the<br>
female. This script is deeply embedded in our customs and laws.<br>
<p>
Here are two examples of this:<br>
<p>
1. All services involving protection and enforcement are almost<br>
exclusively male. Examples are police, firemen and soldiers. This<br>
extends to other physically hazardous jobs, such as logging, heavy<br>
construction, etc.<br>
<p>
2. Every couple of years the politicans start another campaign to hunt<br>
down the "deadbeat dads". I have yet to hear of a campaign to do the<br>
same to "deadbeat moms".<br>
<p>
Musing: Since most Extropians are men, does this imply that being<br>
Extropian is hazardous??<br>
