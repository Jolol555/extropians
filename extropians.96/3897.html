<p>
The same reason the Mac is a poor platform for many Internet technologies.<br>
The vast majority of Internet technologies were and are developed on Unix,<br>
primarily because Unix has superb development and networking tools, as well<br>
as for historical reasons.<br>
<p>
There are many features of the Unix environment that have no analog in the<br>
Mac environment.  The result is that when technologies are ported from Unix<br>
to Mac, some features are either 1) implemented by trying to work around the<br>
limitations of the MacOS, or 2) not implemented at all.  In the case of (1),<br>
the resulting feature generally either doesn't work very well, or doesn't<br>
support the full functionality found in the Unix environment.<br>
<p>
The Windows 3.1 environment is nearly as bad as Mac in this respect even<br>
though DOS has a few of the basic features of Unix.  Windows 95 implements<br>
most of the architectural features of Windows NT.  Windows NT is pretty<br>
compatible with Unix in terms of OS features and supports POSIX.  The only<br>
real difference that I can think of off the top of my head is that NT uses<br>
threads instead of forking, which occasionally causes annoyances when<br>
porting software (although threads are architecturally superior).<br>
<p>
So to answer your original question, they had to do quite a bit of wrangling<br>
to get Java to work on the Mac.  As far as Java platforms are concerned both<br>
Unix and NT have solid environments, and perform equally well.  The one area<br>
of Java where NT and Mac generally outperform Unix is in the interface<br>
implementation (java.awt.*).  The Unix interface implementation tends to run<br>
really slow.  This is mostly the fault of the X-Window system, which is kind<br>
of slow anyway compared to the more tightly bound interfaces used by NT and Mac.<br>
<p>
Hopefully this answered your question (and a lot more).  You can use the Mac<br>
as a Java platform, but Java will run better under NT, Unix, and to a lesser<br>
extent Windows 95.<br>
