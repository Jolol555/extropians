But nobody knows yet what the uploading experience would feel like, and <br>
it will quite possibly be extremely different from sensroy deprivation.<br>
<p>
Hans Moravec describes one model in _Mind Children_, where the experience<br>
most of the time is quite normal, until the robot surgeon says 'Mr Snapp,<br>
you will become virtual now' and you suddenly wake up in a virtual<br>
reality. <br>
<p>
Gradual uploading would be extremely different from this, and uploading <br>
from a cryonic state would also be quite different. The result, an <br>
emulated mind living in a virtual world, would probably more easily be <br>
modelled by using a very good virtual reality.<br>

<p>
Perhaps, but I think it would rather reinforce them ("I don't want to <br>
live in eternal sensory deprivation!"). <br>
