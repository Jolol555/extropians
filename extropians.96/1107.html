That may be the case -- it would be more convincing if you provided some<br>
evidence.<br>
<p>
And would you claim the same is true for most experiments in sociology and<br>
political science?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Nope, there is plenty of experimentation in astronomy and geology.  Didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;astronomers prove that gravity can bend light waves through an experiment?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Um, no.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Um, Albert Einstein predicted what was later confirmed:<br>
<p>
"Since the fixed stars in the parts of the sky near the sun become visible<br>
during a total eclipse, it is possible to check this theoretical conclusion<br>
[a ray of light coming from a fixed star and just grazing the border of the<br>
sun will be deflected by 0.83 seconds of an arc] by experiment."<br>

<i>&gt;From one of Einstein's papers as quoted in "Einstein: His Life and Times"</i><br>
by Philipp Frank (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972, New York)<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;In the physical sciences, you can usually test one variable at a time.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;don't dispute your claim that often you need to vary more than one thing at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a time.  The point is you shouldn't start doing that until after you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;firm understanding (verified through experimentation) of what happens when</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you vary each thing alone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The problem with the social sciences is that there are external forces</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;varying many things *all* of the time.  It's virtually impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;isolate any single factor.  For example, how do you design a rigorous</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;experiment to determine whether giving welfare to unwed, teenage mothers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;will reduce, increase, or have no impact on criminal activity among their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;children when they grow up?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can bring a small number of people into a lab and run an</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment on them, and then do it again tommorow and get similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;results.  You can also vary just one aspect of your experiment.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Your first statement may be true for psychology and microeconomics.  But is<br>
it true for sociology, political science, and macroeconomics?<br>
<p>
As to your second statement, it is certainly true *you* can vary just one<br>
aspect of your experiment.  What I am doubting is whether you can reliably<br>
prevent *other* aspects from being varied.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course the new people are different, and even the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;people would be in different moods, etc.  But you're going to say you</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't do social science because of that, you'll have to dump medical</i><br>
<i>&gt;science too.  Same people, same variance, just asking different questions.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well, medicine is really a mixture of art and science.  Some medical<br>
research is based purely on statistical correlation, while some is based on<br>
cause and effect.  But note that most medical research relies on objective<br>
measurements (e.g., size of a tumor, number of white blood cells per CC,<br>
etc.).  I would think (but I could be wrong) most social science<br>
experiments on human subjects conducted in a lab rely primarily on what the<br>
subjects say.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;How do you run a rigorous experiment to say what any specific welfare</i><br>
<i>&gt;bill would do in any specific state?  Maybe you can't.  But that</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't mean you can't do other things.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We agree.<br>
