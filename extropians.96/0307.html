That was my point exactly: the problem is not hardware. Even von Neumann <br>
investigated introducing parallelism in one of the first machines -- but <br>
he quickly grew disgusted since he kept running into apparently<br>
unsurmountable task organization and coordination problems (a software <br>
problem!), so he abandoned this route very early.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note, that the word 'computer' formerly denoted a <br>
human clerk in charge of computations. In a MIT Press essay I saw a <br>
thesis essentially telling that the advent of digital computers could only <br>
happen so fast because it fell on fertile, already well ploughed ground: <br>
the venerable tradition of organising groups of human computers which <br>
executed sequential algorithms. Astronomical calculation, ballistic <br>
firing tables for artillery, etc.<br>
<p>
Parallelism has always been a blind spot in the Western thinking, all the <br>
way since the antique philosophy. Only very rarely an intrinsically <br>
parallel algorithm is being uneasily contemplated, _as if the world was <br>
sequential_, and not vice versa :(( .<br>
<p>
How can we teach old programmers new tricks? How?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This seems to be similar to the problems with process migration and </i><br>

<p>
Yes. But at least there is _some_ progress: monolithic mainframes are <br>
quite dead, all current supercomputers are either multi-node machines or <br>
workstations clusters running PVM. Since PCs recapitulate the evolution <br>
of mainframes, we'll see true MIMD machines with non-shared memory within <br>
the next 5-10 years. (At least I hope we will see them. I fully expected <br>
maspar machines to appear by 1987. Ack.)<br>

<i>&gt; I think it is mainly a programming problem - we are not very good at </i><br>

Xactly. Just consider Taos<br>

A revolutionary product if I ever saw one. Enthusiastically reviewed by <br>
Dick Pointain of Byte at least 2 times. Has a 12 kByte nanokernel, is <br>
fully hardware independant since based on a VM (hmm, just where did I saw <br>
this feature recently?), etc. etc. etc. Fantastic product. Ok, their <br>
marketing is lousy, but still no response for more than 2 years? We are <br>
still not ripe for maspar, no way, no Sir.<br>

Of course. We are far from being able to do this now. Bioinert implanted <br>
microelectrode arrays with no negative long-term effects are quite beyond <br>
our reach.<br>

It would be interesting what the average extropian (a contradiction in <br>
itself, obviously ;) thinks about this scheme?<br>

Yes, I also seem to be recalling about this number. I am not sure, but I <br>
think it involved a very high energetic load on the mother doing <br>
embryonal development (caution, possible bullshit warning).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; development of the brain so that it grows further after birth (another </i><br>

Yeah, the birth channel. I never liked the amount of deformation <br>
happening to a baby during birth. Uck.<br>

Scotty, adjust the endorphine level by fifteen more units :)<br>
