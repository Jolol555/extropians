I find that my un/sub-conscious mind is much more creative than my  <br>
analytical/conscious mind.  When I've got a particularly difficult problem to  <br>
solve (lately, software analysis/design problems, but math and physics are  <br>
also amenable to this technique), I usually try to familiarize myself with  <br>
all the details, then just forget about it.  Later, usually during my morning  <br>
s**t/shower/shave routine, some semblance of a solution comes to me,  <br>
completely unrequested.  Happily, these gut-level/instinct solutions tend to  <br>
be pretty close to correct, and I then try to rationally justify why it is  <br>
the "best" solution.  That's when discussions with my peers are the most  <br>
beneficial.  A devil's advocate can be your best friend.  If said advocate  <br>
can poke holes in my idea, it's usually because I hadn't grasped all of the  <br>
pertinent facts when I put the problem on the back burner.  Sometime, I can  <br>
consciously incorporate these new forces into the problem, but sometimes it  <br>
requires another sleep-on-it session before I get another idea.<br>
<p>
I've never been able to switch on the "creative" mode at will -- other than  <br>
by going to sleep, an activity that isn't encouraged in most office  <br>
situations.  How do others accomplish this?<br>
