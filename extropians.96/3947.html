Damien R. Sullivan responded:<br>
<i>&gt;I'm not quite clear as to what analogy is being drawn.  It seems to me</i><br>

<p>
Yes, the game stage is a clue to winning chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you're early in the game, you can't tell which rule is being used; if</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're at stage 40, it is more likely that the 1/36 chance is being used. </i><br>
<p>
The two winning chances imply two different distributions over game<br>
stage, and these distributions are only equal at most at one stage.<br>
So everywhere else, the stage is a clue.  At the first stage, the clue<br>
is the strongest that the winning chance is high.<br>
