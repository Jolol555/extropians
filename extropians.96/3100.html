I had read that Motorola was planning on using the Iridium constellation<br>
to provide the online access service. I also had read, or thought I<br>
read, that the Teledesic system was going to be accessible via small 18<br>
inch dishes (which from my own experience, would be very easy to have on<br>
a camper, boat, even a phased array antennae on the roof of a car or as<br>
a fold up pack with a solar panel).  It does not seem like FSS to me.  <br>
The main distinction I was getting at was the difference in bandwidth<br>
one can have depending on a satellite constellations altitude.<br>
