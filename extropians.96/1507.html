Eric Watt Forste wrote 9/28/96:  &lt;I suppose I prefer to place my personal<br>
emphasis on intolerance of authoritarian violence rather than on intolerance of<br>
servility. It just seems like a more direct approach to me.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is not a superficial preference.  It is not clear which is more of a direct<br>
approach.  Servility-and-authoritarian violence is a coupled dynamic system,<br>
like knower-and-known, interpretation-and-map, intention-and-action.<br>
<p>
Since toleration of entropy is ruination, intolerance of it becomes a duty if<br>
the dynamic pursuit of extropy is our chosen purpose.  This is a correct value,<br>
or moral certainty.  You can fight entropy on many fronts:  against the servile<br>
society, against authoritarian violence, or even against our own tendencies<br>
towards slobbery.<br>
<p>
Fighting the servile society is like a pre-emptive strike, e.g., Alexander Pope<br>
and Samuel Francis.  This helps stave off the worst of the authoritarian<br>
violence if a relational threshold of individuals (I'm thinking of percolation<br>
theory), turns from wave-bobbing towards extropy.  Fighting authoritarian<br>
violence often is required late in the game, after an oppressive elite is<br>
entrenched in power, e.g. Alexandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov.  You can't<br>
wait until no independent powers are left in the world to start the fight,<br>
because the internal fight must have external support.  Waiting until America<br>
surrenders its sovereignty to a World State is too late to start fighting<br>
authoritarian violence, there will be no external support.<br>
<p>
Many thinkers have noted the coupling of servility and authoritarian violence.<br>
Alexis de Tocqueville noted that "servility will cower to force, and adulation<br>
will follow power."  He warned against the servility of a radical<br>
egalitarianism:  "What resistance can be offered by customs of so pliant a make<br>
that they have already often yielded?  What strength can even public opinion<br>
have retained when no twenty persons are connected by a common tie... and when<br>
every citizen, being equally weak, equally poor, and equally isolated, has only<br>
his personal impotence to oppose to the organized force of the government?"<br>
  <br>
George Santayana wrote:  "In any close society it is more urgent to restrain<br>
others than to be free oneself.  Hence the tendency for the central authority to<br>
absorb and supersede such as are local or delegated."  Restraining those who<br>
cannot restrain themselves calls forth more and more central authority, whose<br>
elite pursues their own ends, not the general good.  Those ends are invariably<br>
the accumulation of power and wealth, the achievement of which encourage the<br>
elite to keep those restrained from developing the facility of restraining<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
Servility-and-authoritarian violence ratchet up and down together, but the<br>
beginning point for both upward and downward movement is with servility.<br>
Giambattista Vico's axiom is:  "Governments must conform to the nature of the<br>
men governed."  Governing over the dissolute calls forth the demogogue, the<br>
tyrant.  This follows from Vico's additional axioms:  "He who cannot govern<br>
himself must let himself be governed by another who can," and preceding Darwin<br>
by 115 years, "The world is always governed by those who are naturally fittest."<br>
<p>
Here lies real trouble with governmental minimalism.  The only way that minimal<br>
government can work, is when individuals govern themselves.  But individuals<br>
cannot govern themselves without learning to obey themselves, that is, to place<br>
their animal desires for vacant freedom under the sovereignty of their rational<br>
mind which understands the nature of the limitations external reality places on<br>
us.<br>
<p>
And individuals can never learn to obey themselves - that is, develop<br>
self-control - unless they have learned to obey someone above them.  In a<br>
radically egalitarian society, there *is* no one above them, not their bosses,<br>
not their leaders, not their priests, not their parents.  They simply do not<br>
need to learn how to obey authority, because authority is not allowed to<br>
maintain itself in conditions of concrete equality.  Hence, they cannot govern<br>
themselves, and the state grows and grows by necessity, in direct proportion to<br>
the degree that individuals cannot govern themselves.<br>
<p>
Unless there is a policeman inside your head, a policeman must be assigned to<br>
you.  In addition, a policeman must be assigned to each policeman, ad infinitum.<br>
Very quickly you run out of individuals to do the policing necessary.  We are at<br>
this point now, when 40% of GDP goes to government.  For the ideal of minimum<br>
government to work, you must have maximum self-government, and this you can only<br>
have with legitimate hierarchical levels of authority.  But governmental<br>
minimalists often hate hierarchical authority because it so obviously hems in<br>
our freedom, our ability to do as we please - a conundrum.<br>
<p>
The popular bumper sticker "Question Authority" taken literally is largely<br>
harmless, a banal platitude typical of shallow thinking-in-slogans suitable to<br>
"Generation Duh."  But many individuals, steeped in radical egalitarianism, do<br>
not stop at the common sense meaning, they go on to interpret it as if it meant<br>
"Deny Authority."  Now we're in trouble.  Santayana warned:  "Freedom is<br>
legitimate when it does not usurp authority....  The great moral error is not to<br>
admit authority at all."<br>
<p>
The historically recent virtual renunciation of authority has had unpleasant<br>
side effects.  I can still vaguely remember when a Ph.D. conferred more status<br>
on an individual than a shoe salesman had, and when to be a professional didn't<br>
automatically evoke "hooker," selling their integrity to the highest bidder.<br>
But that was thirty years ago.  For the last five years, the operating principle<br>
of the public schools has been that no one will be more educated than the least<br>
educated.  My memory of a time of professional integrity and intellectual<br>
distinction has faded considerably, the nihilistic/egalitarian rot has set in so<br>
fast.  This dual rot produces, on the one hand, individuals who think 'Who<br>
cares?' about status, respect or anything; and on the other hand, individuals<br>
who care deeply for undifferentiated equality amongst everyone, with the<br>
exception of themselves, who, of course, are more equal than the rest.<br>
<p>
Thomas Molnar, in "Authority and its Enemies" (orig. 1976, rev. 1995) again<br>
noted the coupling of servility-and-authoritarian violence, but expanded on its<br>
relation to the legitimacy of authority: "Authority is only mocked and despised<br>
when it is obviously antirational or when it is declining, when the men in power<br>
are themselves no longer convinced of its beneficial presence.  Then... they<br>
abdicate and yield authority to men more determined than they are.  It is the<br>
immemorial experience of mankind... that the decline of authority leads to the<br>
permissive society, which then ushers in the rule of brute force."<br>
<p>
Authority is declining because of a systematic attack on Reason itself.  You can<br>
no more squeeze blood out of a turnip, than you can squeeze extropy out of<br>
scientific nihilism, cultural relativism, and historical revisionism.  They are<br>
not to be tolerated.  Vico refers to these as the barbarism of reflection, and<br>
noted it to be a worse scourge than the barbarism of sense, like the Huns,<br>
Mongols and Vikings.  "For the [barbarism of sense] displayed a generous<br>
savagery, against which one could defend oneself or take flight or be on one's<br>
guard; but the [barbarism of reflection], with a base savagery, under soft words<br>
and embraces, plots against the life and fortune of friends and intimates."<br>
<p>
Molnar goes on to explain:  "Authority does not become irrational by the fact<br>
that *will* is one of its essential components, nor does it become tyrannical by<br>
the fact that it is an articulator and preserver of inequality.  If a society,<br>
with its rich articulation, is reduced to an undifferentiated mass, it is not<br>
authority it will face, but the most oppressive despotism.  Those who exercise<br>
authority must, therefore, have the courage and the will to lift - and keep -<br>
society above the temptations of the anthill."  And those who don't exercise<br>
authority, must be individually intolerant of authoritarian violence.  They also<br>
can go a long way towards preventing authoritarian violence from arising, by<br>
being intolerant of servility - of the wave-bobbers - calling them to turn<br>
towards extropy, and setting a living example of the fruits of such a turn.<br>
