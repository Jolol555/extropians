Thanks to Forrest Bishop for putting some thought into what David Brin<br>
calls the "Berserker" question.  The possibility that there is lots of<br>
life all around, all trying to play dead to avoid retribution, is very<br>
popular among the very best hard science fiction authors, including<br>
Brin, Benford, and Bear.  It is well worth more attention than I gave<br>
it in my Great Filter paper.  (Btw, I extracted the bio part of that<br>
article, made it more formal, and just submitted it to Science.  See:<br>
<a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/hardsteps.ps">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/hardsteps.ps</a>)<br>
<p>
In fact, it would be great fun, and worth doing intellectually, to run<br>
a game-theoretic simulation of this problem.  Could get an Icarus<br>
publication out of it.  Any worthy coauthors interested? :-)<br>
<p>
Let me try to sketch out the strategic situation here.<br>
<p>
A new civilization like ours knows that a shell of our early radio<br>
signals is expanding out at the speed of light, and that this may<br>
trigger "berserker" probes flying in at near the speed of light to<br>
destroy our solar system.  So some folks may want to get the hell out<br>
of here and try to colonize elsewhere.  They'd want to go as fast as<br>
possible, to escape a possible detonation wave of unknown size and<br>
speed (could someone nova our star, or galactic center?), or a<br>
followup wave of berserkers.  And they'd also want to not send signals<br>
back to Earth that such enemies might intercept - signals would have<br>
to look like cosmic background to someone without the right key (and<br>
with the home base keeping your location info very localized, on a<br>
hair trigger to destroy it.)  They'd also want turn a corner<br>
somewhere, so their path away from Earth (ionized regions) doesn't<br>
lead right to them.  And not knowning how far they might be followed,<br>
they'd want to go a good long way.<br>
<p>
New colonies might try to hide themselves better, but even then some<br>
of the locals may get itchy of being traced, or growing too big not to<br>
be seen, and try to escape.  Within any system, keeping the quiet is a<br>
public good, so a strong central policing might be required to enforce<br>
it. <br>
<p>
Star systems might also consider lying low until their technological<br>
advancement seems to asymptote, and suddenly "running for it".  Grow<br>
the local economy as fast as possible, not worrying much about being<br>
loud, to support a massive explosion of colonization probes.  They<br>
might get 10^10 to 10^20 probes out of the system off to all corners<br>
of the universe before enemies arrive.  Or considering the costs and<br>
risks of strong central policing, they might decide to just run for it<br>
from the very beginning.<br>
<p>
A civilization may also want to try to "test the waters", by sending<br>
one probe to a distant system to try this "running for it" strategy,<br>
and to then watch the results.  They might also try a "loud mouth"<br>
strategy in such a distant system, broadcasting as loud as they can to<br>
see who responds how.  Of course just how far away is "distant" is a<br>
tricky question.<br>
<p>
The strategic situation of a potential berserker is also complicated.<br>
If they see a sign of a new civilization, and they send a probe to<br>
destroy it, it might be a trap which lets someone else find them and<br>
destroy them.  If there are many other civilizations around, why<br>
should they be the one to spend the resources and take the risk to<br>
destroy the newcomer?  And if they wait a bit, and still no one else<br>
destroys it, that may just be because others have send probes to sit<br>
near this new site, waiting for catch incoming destroyers. <br>
<p>
If you want to send a probe to not only destroy this system, but to<br>
infiltrate it enough to find out if it is a colony of some other<br>
system, and where that system is, you will have to have your probe<br>
slow down more, and more risk being caught by enemies who might trace<br>
it back to you, especially if you were going to forward that info back<br>
to your home. <br>
<p>
It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the<br>
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the<br>
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,<br>
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years.<br>
That huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new<br>
technology, so some of your descendants become as advanced as your<br>
advanced enemies.<br>
<p>
To verify this intuition, an explicit simulation would be appropriate.<br>
