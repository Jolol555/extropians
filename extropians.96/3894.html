Rush has been a significant source of inspiration for me as well.<br>
And I think Peart is one of the world's greatest poets. Their early<br>
releases were good (at least the ones after Peart joined the band),<br>
but I especially like their work after their talents matured a bit.<br>
"Permanent Waves" was the first Rush album that really impressed me<br>
with it's philosophical lyrics.  Their albums continued to get even<br>
better from that point onward.  As with Yes and Pink Floyd, their<br>
latter work stands as a testament to the value of having &gt;2 decades<br>
of experience in their art.  Especially for those artists who were<br>
very good to begin with.<br>

<i>&gt; While the subject of music is being discussed, are there any Rush fans out</i><br>
<i>&gt; there?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I must sheepishly admit their music had a significant impact on me; it</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly helped me discover extropic values.  I was trapped in a passive</i><br>
<i>&gt; Xtian mentality.  I was even getting to the point of being good at rationlizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then I discover this cool band that sings about the most "outrageous" things:</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal responsibility, rationality, etc.  In mindless suburbia, it was like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; revelation, however mild it might seem now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, just wondering...</i><br>
                                        Peace,<br>
