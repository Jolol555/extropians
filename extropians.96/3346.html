<i>&gt; &gt;The widespread use of computer networks will make it much easier to be</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;an agreeable trade, much like a free lance artist does.  It will become less</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;after day, and it will become easier and more secure for someone to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;several clients that they work for and multiple streams of income, so they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not dependent on any single source of income.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I both agree and disagree.  In some industries (like software engineering)</i><br>
<i>&gt; it already is easier to work for multiple clients at the same time.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; generally working for about three different clients at any given time.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; this method almost always gives more flexibility and a lot more money than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; static "9-to-5" type job.  *However*, there are a lot of negatives that go</i><br>
<i>&gt; along with this as well.  The stress levels are generally much higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; because you have many more obligations than a "normal" job.  Also, you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; get that "warm-fuzzy" secure feeling of always knowing what you will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing 6 months from now.  Even though I can objectively say that I have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulties getting work (their has been an ongoing computer professional</i><br>
<i>&gt; deficit in Silicon Valley), and have never had a situation where I had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; worry about finding a job, it isn't quite the same as knowing exactly where</i><br>
<i>&gt; you will be working and what you'll be doing in the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To be honest, I enjoy the dynamic nature of this situation, but I know a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of computer types who have gotten really burnt out in this type of work</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment.  There is still something to be said for a steady job, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability to spend more time with your family.  TANSTAAFL!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If one is interested in completing a very large and complex project, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;building and maintaining hydroponic greenhouses, then one will want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;organize teams of people to work on this project.  One could first hire a team</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of engineers to plan the project and organize it into sub-projects.  Then one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;could hire teams and individuals to complete the various sub-projects until</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the greenhouses are built and food is being grown in them.  Then one would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;receive requests for food and hire people to transport the food to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;appropriate places.  This is not fundamentally any different than what has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;been done for thousands of years now.  People have been organizing companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and groups to complete projects for quite a long time.  Now it's becoming a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lot easier for the average person to do, because computer networks are helping</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to lower the costs of organizing a business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed.  The Internet has been an enormous help in forming project teams.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a not too small list of developers and programmers that I call or email</i><br>
<i>&gt; whenever I have a large project.  More and more software work is being done</i><br>
<i>&gt; this way.  Most of the software people I know do freelance work for various</i><br>
<i>&gt; projects.  I am working on a $1,000,000 project now where the 25-man</i><br>
<i>&gt; development team is made up entirely of freelancers from around the country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Meetings and discussions take place largely via a mailing list on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Internet.  There is usually one or two consultants or freelancers who "run"</i><br>
<i>&gt; the whole project.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, if you are strictly interested in making money, this is the way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; go.  Sure, you don't have job security, but the pay is great.  Many</i><br>
<i>&gt; independant developers I know have spouses who work steady jobs.  This way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have a guaranteed minimum income and usually medical benefits.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; when you consider that the average freelance developer makes between</i><br>
<i>&gt; $100-500k per year, this is extremely attractive, especially to the younger</i><br>
<i>&gt; age brackets.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I predict that as computer networks become more widespread and their use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;becomes commonplace, a very large percentage of people will be taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;advantage of this technology to make their economic lives extremely flexible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;dynamic and lucrative.  I predict that it will become increasingly less common</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for someone to have a "steady job".  That concept seems radical now, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there aren't so many secure alternatives for employment than working for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;same person day after day.  However, I believe this will change within a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;years, and it will seem foolish and dangerous to have only one major client</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that one is dependent on for income.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In some industries, "steady job" is already meaningless.  Better get used to</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  Actually, I think the "many client" type of environment separates the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wheat from the chaff much better, ability-wise, than the "steady job"</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment.  I think the "many client" environment will cause a wider</i><br>
<i>&gt; separation between the living standards of the competent and incompetent in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a given skill category, not at all a bad thing, IMO.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I believe that people will become much more "project oriented" than they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;today.  I think people will look at employment more in terms of working on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;particular project than they do now.  People will hire other people to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;complete particular projects or tasks, and when the project is done or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;task is completed, they will each go their own way.  As a project manager, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;may find someone who consistently does excellent work, and you may hire them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;regularly to work on various projects, and this will probably be common.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that same person will likely have many other clients that they work for as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I believe that in the future, one's financial situation will more accurately</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reflect the quality of work one does and thus be more fair.  Good workers will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;develop a good reputation, and there will be a high-paying demand for them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and they will generally only accept the highest-paying offers for their work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Those who don't prove themselves to be such good workers will not receive such</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;high-paying offers for their work.  Of course, they could always hire someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to teach them how to improve their skills and become a more excellent worker,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and thus improve their financial situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is exactly the way it currently works in the independant software</i><br>
<i>&gt; development industry.  You can only screw up so many times, and then no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; will hire you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And incidentally, the majority of independant developers are self-taught.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you want to increase your skills, you take it upon yourself to learn more</i><br>
<i>&gt; skills.  This is the way it works.  No one else is responsible for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare except *you*.  I learned a majority of the skills I have by studying</i><br>
<i>&gt; a particular subject I wanted to learn, and then finding a short-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; mediocre job that required those skills.  This way I was able to get the</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical experience, but not at the expense of someone who was paying good</i><br>
<i>&gt; money.  I would then go on to take on the good paying jobs after validating</i><br>
<i>&gt; my newly learned skill.  A lot of people learn this way.  (Lesson here: You</i><br>
<i>&gt; get what you pay for!)  You don't have to pay money to learn a valuable new</i><br>
<i>&gt; skill.  Usually it only involves time, some books, and a short-term pay cut.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Considering human history, it seems that people's economic lives have become</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;increasingly dynamic and are continuing to become even more flexible.  At one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;time, most people were pretty much confined to living in the same village,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;doing the same tasks, all their lives.  As we've progressed and developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;large cities, it has become much easier for people to relocate and to change</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;employers.  Our lives have become much more flexible and filled with more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;options.  I believe that the widespread use of computer networks will create</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;even greater flexibility in people's lives and allow people many more options</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for organizing their lives, including greater flexibility of who they work</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for.  Technology is providing people the tools they need to take care of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;themselves better and manage their own lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Flexibility and options are good, but there is a price.  Large scale</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks are a key component of implementing this flexibility, but I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; it has limits to certain professions and industries.  This would not</i><br>
<i>&gt; generally help a grocery clerk get ahead.  Mostly just skilled professionals.</i><br>
