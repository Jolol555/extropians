    I haven't followed this thread in detail, but can contribute some<br>
things I have read.  Amphibians in general have quite porous skins; thus<br>
there is a concern that they may be more susceptible to increased levels of<br>
toxins of whatever kind in the environment.  This kind of stuff is hard to<br>
study, but folks worried about decreases in frog populations also spend<br>
time trying to think up falsifiable hypotheses, for test, relating to<br>
increased levels of toxins.<br>
<p>
    In some of our field trips and lab work (I have been working on a<br>
second baccalaureate in marine bio over the last six years), we were<br>
cautioned to be sure our hands were very clean of things like lotions,<br>
soap, sunscreen, and the like, before handling amphibians, for fear<br>
that these substances would do them harm.  There is also an<br>
opposite side to the matter; some amphibians secrete substances toxic<br>
to predators -- and incidentally to us -- through their skins, so we<br>
had to be careful for our own sake.<br>
