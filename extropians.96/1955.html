I wouldn't mind volunteering for that experiment. <br>
But without experiment we'll never know. Emotion might be to <br>
extropian/transhumanists as the genes that produce fetal hemoglobin are <br>
to adult humans. Worthy at one time, but now, so much garbage.<br>
<p>
It seems you've already drawn your conclusions before the experiment. I <br>
happen to think CH is on the right track, but we'll never really know for <br>
sure until we try.<br>
