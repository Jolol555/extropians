I look at this being a by-product of monetary system. Money originally<br>
was what I'd call an "enabling technology". It filled a purpose,<br>
namely enabling a freer flow of products and services. It has had a<br>
down-side effect, namely that most things are now done for the sake of<br>
making money. This is not particularly an efficient way to go about<br>
doing things, and I would argue results in a lot of wasted time,<br>
effort, and money. Problems may get solved, but if the solution was<br>
such a good idea, why couldn't it have been achieved without money as<br>
motivation?<br>
<p>
I've been doing some writing recently on planned economies. The Soviet<br>
Union was a good example of a planned economy gone wrong. Is a planned<br>
economy workable at all? I'm not entirely convinced it isn't. I think<br>
the major problem with the Soviet economy was that the control was too<br>
fine grained. It's too complicated to try to design a system where<br>
every aspect of the flow of money is controlled. The patterns are too<br>
complex, there are too many interactions, and the act of controlling<br>
those flows changes the flows themselves.<br>
<p>
The economic system "in the West" could have been designed, but only<br>
at a high level:<br>
<p>
* Assume that a system of trade currently exists (e.g., barter)<br>
<p>
* Create a token (physical) which represents some amount of work or<br>
  product<br>
<p>
* Have people accept the token as valid (this is the hard part<br>
  initially)<br>
<p>
* People can put a value (based in tokens) on any product or<br>
  service they produce.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From here, I would claim you could predict monopolies, slave labour,</i><br>
misers, paid employment (as opposed to entrepreneurs), investment,<br>
etc. It wouldn't predict interest per se, though if you got as far as<br>
banks, you might come up with it.<br>
<p>
In my "ideal planned economy", I would have several goals:<br>
<p>
* guaranteed food and shelter (some how -- guaranteed doesn't<br>
  necessarily mean that some benevolent government is<br>
  involved. Extended families, as opposed to the more recent idea of<br>
  the nuclear family, promote this sort of "social safety net")<br>
<p>
* community-level money systems which augment a more socialist (in the<br>
  true sense of the word) system. The exchange of goods for services,<br>
  services for services, and goods for goods (i.e., barter) is very<br>
  efficient<br>
<p>
I think it's fairly obvious that the attitudes of people living in<br>
such a system would be different from these we see today. The main<br>
point I make with this is that the economy we have today has<br>
essentially zero planning associated with it. As a society, we have no<br>
common goals which drive us to do anything. And given the scale of the<br>
economy we share, I don't think that's possible. Generating small<br>
micro-economies where people involved have common goals may be an<br>
"evolutionary stable strategy" (using Dawkins terms) to eventually<br>
replace the existing economy. Communes, cooperatives, small<br>
communities of people with common goals. I would suggest that the main<br>
point is that if you want to achieve something, you need to plan for<br>
achieving those goals, that it won't happen spontaneously *because* of<br>
the complexity involved. In the existing economy we already have<br>
examples of this happening, in the form of corporations, which act as<br>
a micro-economy where the people involved work towards a common goal<br>
(this doesn't say anything of whether those people really care for<br>
what they are producing, and the "common goal" is more often than not<br>
to make money -- try saying something else and get investment!)<br>
