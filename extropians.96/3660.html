Sure it's possible. But you may be jumping the gun. Much of the planet<br>
is still organized on a precapitalistic basis where the person who<br>
controls the most armed men gets the resources. And this military-based<br>
(note that I do not strongly distinguish between military and police)<br>
command-and-control system still disposes with about 50% of the<br>
production in, for instance, the United States. (That's a mix of<br>
confiscation and mandate... if you think the number is less than<br>
50%, perhaps you are failing to take mandates into account.)<br>
<p>
If the market-based monetary short-hand for value were actually<br>
the medium through which 80% or 90% of the world economy flowed,<br>
I'd be a lot more interested in the line of thought you are <br>
drawing out. But I think it's premature to worry too much about<br>
how to improve on monetary-based trade when we still have so much<br>
room in which to improve on coercion-based mandate and confiscation.<br>
