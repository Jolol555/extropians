E. Shaun Russell laments the fact that humans often assume too much that isn't <br>
based on facts.  And he laments that fact-based discussions are boring.  He <br>
says, "There has to be some sort of equilibrium between fact and filler.  <br>
There must be some way to say what we want to say while still keeping some <br>
sense of 'being human' within our words."<br>
<p>
I think one way to avoid many of the problems with assumptions is to never <br>
forget that an assumption is an assumption, based on certain facts that you <br>
actually experience.  Using the automobile accident example that Shaun brought <br>
up, the person seeing the crashed cars may reasonably assume that one of them <br>
was going too fast.  This may or may not be true, so they should remember that <br>
it is only an assumption, while the fact that they saw crashed cars is a fact. <br>
 <br>
<p>
So when they get home, they can tell their friends, "I saw a couple crashed <br>
cars downtown.  I think one of them was going too fast, because the other one <br>
was smashed up really badly and thrown up on the sidewalk.  Or maybe the one <br>
that got hit, ran the red light and went in front of the other car.  I'm not <br>
really sure.  But there was glass all over the street and sidewalk, and the <br>
left side of one car was smashed in really bad, and the front end of the other <br>
one was all mangled up.  I bet the driver of the car that got hit was killed <br>
or hurt pretty badly; there were three ambulances there and two firetrucks, <br>
and the police were still pouring in and starting to direct traffic."<br>
<p>
This way, they're stating the facts of what they saw and then stating what <br>
they're assuming, given those facts.  They've given a lot of facts and <br>
assumptions, but someone listening knows what they actually saw and what <br>
they're assuming from that because they use words like "I saw" and "I think" <br>
and "I bet" and "there was".  It's a matter of training yourself to accurately <br>
say things.  If you're talking about something you observed, then make it <br>
clear that it is something you observed, and if you're talking about something <br>
you are assuming from your observations, make that clear as well.  If you're <br>
expressing your opinion, make it clear that you're doing that.  And it doesn't <br>
have to be dry and boring, like my example shows; it just has to be clear to <br>
the listener what you actually saw and what you are assuming.<br>
<p>
I'm reminded of the part in _Stranger in a Strange Land_, by Robert Heinlen, <br>
where a Fair Witness is asked what color a house in the distance is.  She <br>
says, "White, on this side."  The Fair Witnesses are trained to observe <br>
everything very carefully and remember everything fully.  They are very good <br>
at separating observation from assumption.<br>
