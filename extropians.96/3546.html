OK, it is time for my bi-monthly reaction: I HATE THIS SILLY MEME!<br>
<p>
Recently, there have been far too much singularity-worship here on the<br>
list. Many extropians unfortunately see it as inevitable, easy and Destiny<br>
itself. It isn't. It is a neat idea invented by Vinge that has caught our<br>
imagination and fits in with *some* trends we see. There is IMHO no more<br>
real support of it than the inevitability of the dictatorship of the<br>
proletariat; if there are, I would like to see a well-researched paper<br>
about it. <br>
<p>
But back to the animation problem: thinking that as soon as we get<br>
nanotech/uploading/AI all problems will be solved and we will happily<br>
transcend is plain wishful thinking. It is in a way similar to the old<br>
pulp sf idea of the lone inventor building the first spaceship in his<br>
backyard - in reality it took a huge program and involved thousands of<br>
engineers, scientists and workers. Even if we are in truth moving towards<br>
a singularity, there is a huge difference between cell repair (hard,<br>
requires mature nanotech and a good understanding of medicine) and the<br>
singularity (requires... what?). We should not mix up what can be<br>
estimated using theoretical applied science from what is pure speculation. <br>
<p>
I'm sorry for this somewhat heated response, but I feel we have to tend<br>
our memetic garden so that it will not become a tangle of weeds. The<br>
singularity is an interesting concept, but it is not a fact and not a<br>
central tenet of extropianism. <br>
