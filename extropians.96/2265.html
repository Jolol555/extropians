I used to put up a lot of resistance to the idea of being a<br>
professional software engineer because it seemed so cold and<br>
abstract. But as the demands of the market and my own desire for<br>
income combined to draw me into that profession like a tractor<br>
beam, I found that creating software or modifying existing software<br>
really does feel much like writing poetry or sculpting (or, as is<br>
unfortunately most often the case, like editing someone else's<br>
poetry or modifying someone else's sculpture). The audience is a<br>
bit limited because the only people who get to really appreciate<br>
the work of most software engineers is other software engineers...<br>
the exception to this last rule is the user-interface engineers,<br>
and I suspect that that's one reason why that is such a popular<br>
line of work within software engineering.<br>
<p>
Certainly, in my occasional attempts to struggle for a good<br>
perspective on the changes that are sweeping through the global<br>
economy, it looks to me that as we get better at producing physical<br>
things with fewer and fewer resource requirements, what most of us<br>
*people* will have to be "specializing" in is producing information<br>
that is of value to other people. And that seems to be what most<br>
of us on this list (researchers, artists, engineers, writers,<br>
mathematicians, consultants, managers, lawyers, philosophers,<br>
musicians, etc) are already doing.<br>
<p>
Art and science are often contrasted. But two things that Dali's<br>
painting "Raphaelesque Head Exploding" has in common with Maxwell's<br>
theory of electromagnetism is that both are information structures<br>
that required incredible effort of their developers, and that both<br>
are of inestimable value to me.<br>
