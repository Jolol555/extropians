This may be a matter of taste, and my tastes in this matter are rather<br>
ferociously pluralistic. Are you arguing for the homogenization of culture,<br>
or against it? I oppose the homogenization of culture; in the *long* term I<br>
think it would be a disaster. However, I also recognize that the only<br>
long-term solution to this problem is offplanet diaspora. And in the<br>
post-diaspora future I'm fairly confident that purposes/values will not<br>
only be diverse, but will proliferate and ramify far beyond the scale of<br>
value pluralism that we see around us in the world today.<br>
<p>
In fact, that's the long-term goal toward which I work, because such a<br>
cosmos of ramifying and proliferating cultures is precisely the sort of<br>
cosmos in which I'd like to live in the long term.<br>
<p>
The preservation of opportunities for the careful and painstaking pursuit<br>
of all sorts of frivolous values is exactly what I like about peace and<br>
liberty. First things come first, but the whole point of securing first<br>
things is to allow time and security to work on secondary things... the<br>
elegant and deliciously frivolous music of Maurice Ravel, for instance. Or<br>
the exploration of Banach spaces. Or toy trains and flower arrangements.<br>

<p>
I think I know of what you speak, but I don't know whether or not there's<br>
much point trying to decide (a) whether or not you and I have had the same<br>
vision and (b) whether the content of this vision is "really" monist or<br>
"really" pluralist.<br>
