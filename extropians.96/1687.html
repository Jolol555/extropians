Ira Brodsky:<br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps transhumanists should program themselves to experience an</i><br>
<i>&gt;intense orgasm (or something analogous) every time they acquire</i><br>
<i>&gt;important knowledge, gain new insights, or create (or even procreate?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;something of value.</i><br>
<p>
This is a actually an excellent idea. The major problem is that many of =<br>
the<br>
responses we want to reprogram function at a very low level. The two<br>
basic feelings are lust and hunger. Normally the responses of these =<br>
feelings<br>
are sex or food. For some time, whenever I feel lust, I try to associate<br>
the feeling, not with sex, but with the feeling of success and wealth.<br>
Similarily (handy when you practice calorie restriction) I try to<br>
associate hunger with work. These are just simple examples but I think<br>
there are many motivational feedback circuits that can be reprogrammed<br>
in similair fashion, perhaps in combination with drug/hormon theraphy.<br>
<p>
Now I only have to find some time to study more medicin and psychology.<br>
