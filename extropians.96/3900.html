----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: James Rogers </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know if you could do the same with a $1500 budget, </i><br>
<p>
you can.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't generally consider Ace of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Base to be quality music anyway (from a musical standpoint).</i><br>
<p>
agreed... i were talking about a good investment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My style was greatly affected by my mood at the moment, and I have tried</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost every style at one time or another, but in general I stayed in 4</i><br>
genres:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
not to far from my taste. If you have been into the "cyber" thing (i'm a<br>
bit afrid to say the c-word these days :-) ) maybe you will like my graphic<br>
novel:<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; I suspect my minimum requirements for equipment</i><br>
<i>&gt; are somewhat higher than they need to be</i><br>
<p>
I to have been thruu expensive studio setups, and have found out that i<br>
don't really need it anymore. A kebord, a sampler and a computer is all<br>
thats neede. In a wery short time affordable soundcards will take over it<br>
all. (I read once in "Keyboard" magazine that the amount of money spend on<br>
music instruments worldwide was less than whats spend in a big US Mart.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Its not what you have, but what you do with what you have.</i><br>
<p>
I know what you mean, but it's not quite right. There's a lot of "buts" to<br>
that remark.<br>
