<i>&gt;Brothers and sisters?  All those cretins who are overrunning this planet </i><br>
<i>&gt;are my brothers and sisters?  I think that's a pretty offensive notion.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I wonder what your agenda is, Michael.  Are you simply trying to </i><br>
<i>&gt;obfuscate this list with ongoing snide remarks intended to piss people </i><br>
<i>&gt;off?   If so, I don't particularly like having you on the list, dude.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;You and your "Lorrey Drive" belong on alt.crackpot.inventors.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oh...  I guess that settles it.  So, film evidence does exist after all. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course -- of course! -- these films are only available to military </i><br>
<i>&gt;classes and researchers.  Naturally.  Thanks, Kathryn.  I wish you had </i><br>
<i>&gt;told me that last year, it would have saved me a lot of trouble.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I won't be a revisionist anymore.  There's no use arguing with films </i><br>
<i>&gt;ordered by Hitler himself.  I'll be a good boy from now on.  </i><br>

WHAT IS GOING ON HERE! Over this holiday weekend I have seen peoples<br>
attitudes change for the worst. Mine included. What is it about the winter<br>
holidays that are doing this to us or are we just getting increasingly more<br>
hostile. First I believe it was Lorrey "My Website" bashing, shortly<br>
followed by my bashing over "CHRIS HIND WANTS TO BE EXTROPY'S SPOKESPERSON"<br>
(Which I must admit QueenMUSE, was clever) =c)<br>
But attitudes have dramatically skyrocketed for the worse this holiday<br>
season. Is it due to bad family relations, being trapped indoors due to bad<br>
weather, too much holiday candy creating exorbitant sugar rushes? What?<br>
(P.S. Sorry to use you as an example Lyle, it's just the final straw for<br>
me.) "Can't we all just get along?" :)<br>
