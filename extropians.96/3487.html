On the other hand it might be quite a good thing to have any religious <br>
opposition start its opposition now, when the technology doesn't exist, and<br>
therefore is less threatening. If they can be whipped into a "holy furor"<br>
over something that doesn't yet exist, they can be ridiculed the way that<br>
serious opposition to genetic research was in the late 70's.<br>
Tell a populace that they "shouldn't" or "can't" do something, and you will<br>
find them flocking to it.<br>
Robert Maplethorpe's exhibitions would have been little noticed events save<br>
for the efforts of the opposition to them.<br>
If the opposition bases its case largely on the Book of Revelation rather<br>
than serious discussion of the downsides of nanotech, and the social upheavals<br>
it will cause, then much of the battle will have been ceded to the pro nano<br>
side.<br>
