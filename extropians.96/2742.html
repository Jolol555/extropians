Yes, creating a stable environment for uploads is a nontrivial problem. <br>
We need a large number of processes that interact in a robust, efficient <br>
way (no, no upload can run as a single process - physics prevents that <br>
powerful single processor systems, we have to go parallel) that can <br>
withstand errors, breakdowns and crashes.<br>
<p>
For example, assume my brain is run on ten processor clusters and one<br>
crashes (because a nano-squirrel munched up the power cable?). How to<br>
handle it?  One natural solution would be to freeze the other nine<br>
clusters as soon as the error is detected (which takes a short time<br>
compared to my emulated mental processes) while error checking takes place<br>
(was the data sent to the other clusters corrupted before the crash? I<br>
don't want an involuntary digital ECT). Now we need to get the mental<br>
state of one tenth of my mind, either from backup or by backtracking, and<br>
place it on another processor cluster. Clearly nontrivial, especially<br>
since most of us don't want to loose too much of our minds when the lags<br>
on our networks become too much and out internal communications become<br>
asynchronus. <br>
<p>
The above example suggests that fine-grained parallelism is the way to go <br>
with our minds, we might even be able to stand a few emulated neurons <br>
crashing. <br>
