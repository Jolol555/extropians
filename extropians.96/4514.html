I've never seen a definite answer to a recurring pet idea of mine: to <br>
(transiently) stellify Jupiter by means of a nuke detonated in its <br>
metallic (or at least somewhere deep enough where hydrogen is <br>
sufficiently dense) hydrogen layer. You know, it's Christmas, and <br>
twinkle, twinkle. Why not?<br>
<p>
Why has this not happened before naturally? Shoemaker-Levy went by far <br>
not deep enough, and was by far not hot enough (we'd need 100 MK, not 100 <br>
kK) the total energy release was sure enormous, but it was much too <br>
difuse, and it affected atmospherical layers which were not dense enough. <br>
A hardened thermonuclear charge can descend pretty far down, before <br>
rising pressure and temperature would grew unberable for its electronics <br>
and the chemical explosive primer. So we let off the firecracker just <br>
before it would go fizz-fizz, just by itself.<br>
<p>
What would happen? Either nothing (has anybody calculated this?), or we'd <br>
start a fusion reaction, which would blast a considerable (yet <br>
negligeable in relation to the residue) amount of hot hydrogen into the <br>
sky, leaving the result somewhat hotter than it was before. Thusly we <br>
might fabricate a short-lived ersatz Sun for the Jovian satellite system, <br>
to better mine them (solar power is terribly thin out there). (Now why <br>
must I instantly think of that Clarke chap?)<br>
<p>
Since we are at madcap ideas, again: I've been reading up on some <br>
preliminary prospection, erm, cosmochemistry. What is the legal <br>
situation: which country/person owns the Moon? Phobos? Is this a claim <br>
thing, first comes first, or is it currently legally undefined? I'd <br>
assume the latter. As you doubtlessly know, unmanned LEO launch capacity <br>
will soon grew progressively cheaper and cheaper, currently there are (tiny) <br>
amateur satellites up there. Assuming one would start a large private <br>
project, with the goal of constructing a smallish von-Neumann probe (the <br>
Moon, or a suitable asteroid for target), complete with an ion drive <br>
sufficiently strong to carry it from MEO. Of course, one would need much <br>
better digital electronics, and through research into industrial <br>
processes in hard-vacuum/low-grav conditions, but we might be ready to <br>
launch such a beastie 20-30 years from now. After the stuff arrives, <br>
unfolds, autoreplicates, etc. etc. you could ferry around (solar sails) <br>
arbitrary amounts of processed materials, e.g. nickel-iron steel, organics <br>
(plastics, etc.) titanium, platinum, solar cells, whatever. One could <br>
deliver the stuff by ballistic course to any place on Earth, using the <br>
atmospheric layer for decceleration. <br>
<p>
What's your oppinion, when will the general public realize that all above <br>
is not just another fraudulent scheme, and would invest in such a company?<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. Anybody knows where one can read up on Alan Guth from MIT, <br>
preferably on the web? Thanks!<br>
