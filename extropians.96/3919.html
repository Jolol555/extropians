<i>&gt; Maybe I'm just being "picky", but I believe that there is a difference </i><br>
<i>&gt; between "If I understand you correctly, this seems to be mystical nonsense."</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the terse "What mystical nonsense." that you wrote.</i><br>
<p>
Fair enough.  I suppose after 10 years on the Net, I have grown<br>
accustomed to the direct from-the-hip approach.  I find it very<br>
productive and economical (note that your version is 11 words to<br>
my 3).  If I were writing for an unknown lay audience as opposed<br>
to a specialized list like this, I might be more concilliatory.<br>
But even there I find the trend of assigning "tolerance" to be a<br>
virtue of speakers rather than of listeners to be dangerous, and<br>
being deliberately provocative is one way of fighting that trend.<br>
<p>
How's this: "Given my understanding of your words, and the chance<br>
that you may have misspoken your real intentions, my personal set<br>
of values would rate that idea as mystical nonsense, but that's<br>
not to imply that you are an inherently evil person who eats<br>
children or anything, just that my particular set of values, no<br>
doubt influenced by an upbringing and life experience different<br>
from yours, would evaluate the idea that way.  Or not."<br>
<p>
That's 73 words.  I think I'll stick to my 3.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;A slave may know, for example, that there are values attainable with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;freedom far beyond what he can attain in his present condition.  But if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;he values mere biological life incomparably high to those values, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;he will logically not risk his life for freedom, but choose to remain</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;alive and in chains.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay, I will accept that my original word "insane" was grossly mistaken and</i><br>
<i>&gt; pejorative. However, there *does* seem to be a major difference between us</i><br>
<i>&gt; which may not even be open to judgement. Would you trade *any* values you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have (short of your life, of course) for some sum of money?</i><br>
<p>
I certainly wouldn't criticize you for being pejorative. :)  The short<br>
answer is yes, but of course I have to measure the money in terms of<br>
the condition of my life after the trade--if the offer is for my head,<br>
the money isn't worth much to a corpse.  Perhaps a better way to make<br>
such measurements is indirectly with "risk" rather than "trade".  Would<br>
I take a 1 in 2000 chance of death in a year to make a certain 5-figure<br>
amount I don't care to disclose here?  Yes, I do it every day when I<br>
drive to work.  That's a pretty simple comparison of a safe life of<br>
poverty to a risky life of reasonable wealth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [finger-chopping story]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Clearly, ones values of various things depend on ones circumstances. They also</i><br>
<i>&gt; very much depend on the discount rate which one applies to future value versus</i><br>
<i>&gt; present value, but that's a whole other discussion topic.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't quite put it that way, but I think I agree.  The "cirumstances"<br>
/are/ the values in that case.  Some kinds of lives ("freedom") are more<br>
valuable than other kinds of lives ("slavery").  That doesn't mean that<br>
the "value of life" is unknowable--just that the latter definition is<br>
insufficiently precise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is very true and very elegantly written. Ayn Rand couldn't have done any</i><br>
<i>&gt; better. :) I am not trying to disparage any of this. However, I believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; many people who are to adamant about this sometimes forget the value of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpersonal attributes such as love, honor, loyalty, joy, etc. which are only</i><br>
<i>&gt; very indirectly related to money.</i><br>
<p>
I don't really buy that (no pun intended).  Such things might very well be<br>
what makes life worth living, but no matter how much passion one puts<br>
into them, their value is still measurable.  I cannot help but think that<br>
to treat them otherwise is just a product of prejudices against money<br>
hammered into our brains by fuzzy-thinking altruists who just don't want<br>
to face the hard work of finding values rationally. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;[measurement of values is required for rational choice of action]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't agree with this. Either in a given set of circumstances they would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomparable (I always use this in the mathematical sense) and not be capable</i><br>
<i>&gt; of being in conflict, or in another set of circumstances, they would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparable and again not in conflict.</i><br>
<p>
Again, the circumstances and consequences of a choice are part and parcel<br>
of the value being measured.  Only after that final evaluation is made,<br>
and the two wholes compared, can one make a rational choice.<br>
Of course, there's also game-theory conditions where randomness is a<br>
rational part of the decision process, but then the choice to use such<br>
methods and abide by the results is a value as well.<br>
