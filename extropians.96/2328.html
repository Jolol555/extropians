Ira Brodsky writes, responding to me:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Logic is, and by rights ought to be, slave to the emotions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     --Bertrand Russell</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You falsely divide the world into "logic" and "emotion."  What about knowledge?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, "with logic alone you can [only] calculate outcomes from premises."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Likewise, with emotion alone you can only react.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The real question is: where do we get our premises?  You are clearly better</i><br>
<i>&gt;off if your premises come from understanding, not emotion.  The same goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;for values.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Poor Bertrand Russell.  It is too late for him to disown such a foolish</i><br>
<i>&gt;statement. &lt;g&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Okay, with logic and knowledge you can calculate outcomes.<br>
But what lets you say one outcome is "better" than another?  This isn't<br>
really "knowledge," it's prejudice, bias, *value*.<br>
<p>
If you encode values as well as knowledge into your premises, you're<br>
effectively programming them into a computer.  If it works, then what<br>
you've done is program emotions.  As I said, emotions are the logic of<br>
values.<br>
<p>
Values cannot come from understanding.  Only knowledge does<br>
(except if you are talking about understanding values you already had).<br>
You can't get values except from having them already, explicitly, implicitly,<br>
tacitly, or built into your structure.  As they say, you can't derive<br>
"ought" from "is."  But if you have values, and you're doing any thinking<br>
or information-processing in light of them, that's emotion.  That's all<br>
emotion is.<br>
<p>
When people say that emotions are bad sources of information,<br>
what I understand to be going on is this: one part of their value system<br>
is telling me it doesn't like the urgings of other parts.  The person<br>
is saying that they have conflicts within their value system.  The fact<br>
that some emotions claim not to be emotions is the result of a lot of<br>
terrible ideas from our past.<br>
<p>
An example of an emotion pretending not to be an emotion is when you said:<br>
   "You are clearly better off if your premises come from understanding,<br>
                    ^^^^^^^^^^<br>
    not emotion.  The same goes for values."<br>
<p>
What is "better off," if not a value, an emotion?  Without emotion you<br>
don't care whether your premises lead to prosperity or ruin.  Without<br>
emotion there is no "better."<br>
<p>
So I hope I've restored the peaceful smile on Bertrand Russell's face. :-)<br>
<p>
Ira later responds to queenMUSE:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think what you are really saying is that, contrary to Bertrand Russell,</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotions can be a good thing *if* they are tamed by reason and</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In that case, we agree.</i><br>
<p>
I would sort of agree.  Only in my view, reason is a *tool* that different<br>
emotions *use* to work out ways of peacefully coexisting.  Same between<br>
different people: reason is the negotiating method.  Saying that reason<br>
"tames" emotion is like saying the internet "makes people friends".<br>
<p>
Natasha says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps what we are after is a sensibility towards _refined emotions_.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Refined emotions are developed through exercising careful thinking. [...]</i><br>
<p>
Freud talks about "sublimation," and for years I thought the "sub" meant<br>
under, as in pushing under a socially acceptable cover.  But no, it means<br>
*making sublime*, as in the sublimation of dry ice--turning into something<br>
lighter or higher.<br>
<p>
My belief is that most emotions are perfectly<br>
sane, clear, beautiful, useful, etc., in their original states, but that<br>
they become nasty when treated badly.  The nasty emotions that everyone<br>
seems to be afraid of are just urges that have been given a hard<br>
time and none of the positive attention they deserved, and end up not<br>
knowing any approved ways of expressing themselves or fitting in.<br>
As Neitzsche says, believing in evil is what *makes* evil.<br>
<p>
This is why even "managed emotions" sounds problematical to me, since it's<br>
management that creates emotional problems in the first place.  We have<br>
to get out of the implicit belief in (or desire for) a place *outside of*<br>
emotions, from which to manage, refine, tame or control them.  Instead say<br>
I am a bag of emotions in partial conflict but also seeking harmony with<br>
each other.<br>
