Chris Hind is wondering why women appear so elegant and beautiful to him while <br>
men appear bland and boring.  He's wondering if he'd view it differently, if <br>
he was a different intelligent species, looking at humans.<br>
<p>
Chris, you're a guy.  Of course you think women look beautiful.  I think women <br>
look beautiful too.  I've noticed something about myself, which I think may be <br>
common among most males, is that I tend to look at women much more than I look <br>
at men.  If I am passing a group of people, my mind seems to automatically <br>
look for the women.  I think that males' obsession with women causes us to see <br>
them as more beautiful than men.  I also think that most men are very <br>
reluctant to recognize the beauty of other men, since homophobia is so rampant <br>
in our society.  <br>
<p>
I've allowed myself to recognize the beauty of other men, and I think that men <br>
are as beautiful as women.  It is a different sort of beauty, a different <br>
style, but I think both men and women are very beautiful.  It's a matter of <br>
allowing yourself to see that.  And not being scared of unexpected emotions.<br>
