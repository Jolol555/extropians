I think there is none. Observation is part of the experiment. Afaik there <br>
is nothing in the definition of the experimental setup requiring it to be <br>
created by human experimentators. It has just to be well defined.<br>
<p>
Exactly as you wrote, experimental setups &amp; observation (measurement) <br>
procedere are designed to reduce impacts of undesired variables, ideally <br>
excluding them altogether.<br>
<p>
In social sciences experiments are usually impossible. Even observations<br>
of system's behavious, are difficult, since isolated systems either do <br>
not exist or the entire range of relevant parameters is impossible to <br>
obtain and/or to interprete.<br>

Yes. This is a change of parameters. The universe is one great lab. By <br>
choosing appropriate observation locations much can be learned.<br>

<p>
I think you are using an unconventional definition of an experiment.<br>
