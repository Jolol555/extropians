Not an unusual dream, I guess, getting rich.<br>
One of the things that I dreamed I could do if<br>
I had enough money, is to support people who<br>
influence the social and technological development.<br>
I would institute a fund that would give stipends<br>
to people who did great work in the previous year,<br>
so that they could continue it into the next.<br>
  There are many such funds, I know.  They just<br>
do not give resources to the people who I think<br>
are most deserving.<br>
  It would be difficult for me personally to<br>
select how much to give to whom.  So I would<br>
probably ask a bunch of people to help me with it.<br>
I wonder if something like that could be done on<br>
Internet:  Have a list of people nominated for <br>
the Internet/Extropian/Information/Memetic awards,<br>
and let Internet folk and companies look at what<br>
they have done so they could contribute to their<br>
stipends. Do you think anything like this can fly?<br>
<p>
My modest list (without much thinking) would<br>
start with: [clenching my teeth to be modest here ;-) ]<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg<br>
David McFadzean<br>
Eric Drexler<br>
Fleming Funch<br>
Max More<br>
Robin Hanson<br>
..........<br>
<p>
Maybe, just a list without the stipends would be good<br>
for a start.  Maybe, a list of contributors with<br>
references to their home pages would entice people<br>
to contribute.<br>
<p>
A list of techno-info-villains may also be interesting:<br>
<p>
Dorothy Denning<br>
Jeremy Rifkin<br>
Theodore Kaszynski [sp.?]<br>
........<br>
