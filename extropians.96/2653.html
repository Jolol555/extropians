On Tuesday, October 29, 1996 11:54 PM, Chris Hind wrote:<br>
&lt;The whole concept of uploading reminds me of Aladdin where Jafar becomes <br>
the genie (ie. The universe is mine to command! to control!) Just hope <br>
humans left behind don't destroy our magic lamp!&gt;<br>
<p>
On Friday, November 01, 1996 12:12 PM, Anders Sandberg replied:<br>
&lt;Designing an organism (say a dragon) from scratch is equivalent to having <br>
a genie machine that you can tell "Build a working spaceship!". [SNIP] <br>
Until I get my neutron star computer, I plan to make small worlds.&gt;<br>
<p>
On Tuesday, November 05, 1996 2:55 PM, Eugene Leitl insisted:<br>
&lt;AR, not VR. VR is something you can buy even now. Requiring an artifical <br>
reality closely modeled after the pre-upload physical world is a weakness, <br>
imo.&gt;<br>
<p>
In these recent discussions, no one appears to considered the 'alternative' <br>
of 'ER', the type of things that Alexander Chislenko has written about <br>
ENHANCED REALITY at <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/EnhancedReality.html">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/EnhancedReality.html</a><br>
(also published in Extropy #16):<br>
&lt;[A]ugment human senses with transparent external information <br>
pre-processors ... create personalized interactive illusions ... propelled <br>
by real events, but would show the world the way a person wants to see it <br>
... wiring exosomatic sensors to our nervous systems may allow us to better <br>
feel our environments ... virtualize and superimpose on the image of the <br>
real world your favorite mythological characters and imaginary companions, <br>
and provide other educational and recreational functions.&gt;<br>
<p>
This seems much more economical than trying to develop an AR from scratch: <br>
you wouldn't have to rely entirely on your own creations (the whole world <br>
is 'off-the-shelf'), you could interact with billions of other conscious <br>
beings all slicing and dicing and reaggregating the real-time feeds from <br>
around the wired universe along with you.<br>
<p>
The BIG problem with this scenario, however, is that it might kill the <br>
sacred cow of "H. accelerans". The need (under ER) for real-world <br>
interaction and the desire to make use of *all* available substrates for <br>
data storage, communication and computation makes it unlikely that <br>
gradually uploaded, or augmented, minds would be much faster than analog <br>
meat minds (at least initially). Also, an ER-based mind would likely want <br>
to use distributed sensing and computing components.<br>
<p>
On Thursday, October 31, 1996 12:04 PM, James Rogers objected that:<br>
&lt;Being able to "jack in" to cyberspace is only marginally useful if you <br>
don't have the processing power to go with it.  Sure, you may have access <br>
to vast quantities of information, but if you are still processing it or <br>
thinking about it at tissue speeds then you aren't much better off. [SNIP] <br>
Bandwidth and latency is also an issue.  A distributed intelligence would <br>
require some level of synchronization between its distributed components to <br>
operate in any type of coherent fashion.  Imagine if our neurons had to <br>
communicate with each other via UUCP!&gt;<br>
<p>
Still, on Monday, November 04, 1996, Michael Lorrey declared:<br>
&lt;I believe that the technology for slow gradual uploads will develop much <br>
sooner than a flash upload capability.&gt;<br>
<p>
And, 'way back' on Tuesday, October 29, 1996 6:34 AM, Algimantas Malickas <br>
wrote:<br>
&lt;I have wrote a paper "Gradual Uploading as a Cognition of Mind". It is <br>
placed in<br>
<a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Uploading/gupload.html">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Uploading/gupload.html</a>&gt;<br>
<p>
In this essay Malickas proposes:<br>
&lt;The gradual uploading requires addition of artificial neural network (or <br>
other means of AI) to the brain. After this, the brain and the external <br>
system would operate as one system. During this common coexistence, the <br>
memory and other functions of mind would gradually grow into the external <br>
system and would survive after the brain's death.&gt;<br>
<p>
Gradual uploading and ER have the advantage that they are things that can <br>
be worked on now (as opposed to John Clark's destructive "pulse gamma ray <br>
laser that can make a hologram of the human brain").  BUT, a serious <br>
disadvantage is that a gradual uploading approach, such as that proposed by <br>
Algimantas Malickas, might not be able to capture *all* of the memories and <br>
emotional/value preferences that might be burried in deep neural structures <br>
because, as Malickas admits:<br>
&lt;The gradual uploading would be uploading of mind functions, not uploading <br>
of a morphological brain architectures.&gt;<br>
<p>
This might even have advantages over simply copying the existing brain <br>
structure: we could throw out any emotional quirks we no longer want to be <br>
burdened with, experiment with removing obsolete structures left over from <br>
evolution, optimize various functions for the cyberspace environment, etc. <br>
 Still, judging from the recent posts from people fearful about losing <br>
their unique stream of consciousness, this might not be acceptable to those <br>
who want to be uploaded with all their organic experiences intact.<br>
<p>
However, as Lyle Burkhead wrote in his Fri, 11 Oct 1996 post on <br>
"made-to-order cells", eventually:<br>
&lt;We will be able to design a very small "monitor cell" whose job it is to <br>
insinuate itself into the brain, and, in conjunction with millions of other <br>
such cells, keep track of everything that goes on in there.  [snip] If we <br>
are going to have a very fine-grained model of the brain, something like <br>
this will have to happen. We have to have sensors in there, picking up <br>
real-time information about how the neurons work, and this has to happen <br>
while the brain is "on," so to speak.&gt;<br>
<p>
Under this scenario, uploading would be a gradual process of 'raising your <br>
consciousness', slowly growing it into other, more permanent and flexible <br>
substrates, until eventually you've uploaded and *taught* your systems all <br>
'they' need to know about your data, rules, forms, views, experiences and <br>
goals, so that you've actually succeeded in *implanting* your consciousness <br>
into these cybernetic extensions of your biological being.<br>
<p>
Now, if you go to all this effort, is the upload that remains really 'you'? <br>
That depends on how good a job *you* did in creating and informing your <br>
'higher' self.  Even an instantaneous and perfect upload of your current <br>
brain won't eliminate the need for alot of hard work at self <br>
transformation.<br>
