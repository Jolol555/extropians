Chris Hind brought up the intriguing idea of people communicating, using a <br>
visual language.  He then said, <br>
<p>
"In a line I read from snow crash, languages seem to break apart into multiple <br>
dialects rather than unify, so it's best to centralize the language but allow <br>
for unlimited character combinations and voting on new character types so <br>
allow evolution and flexibility of the language."<br>
<p>
Chris, languages don't work like that.  You can't plan it out and expect that <br>
everyone's going to do that.  People are going to communicate however they <br>
want to, in their own styles.  Ideas that people like will become more popular <br>
and as people communicate more with visual images, certain customs will <br>
develop spontaneously.  It will seem most correct to people to use certain <br>
images to convey certain ideas, because that's what's worked well in the past. <br>
 The people that come up with effective images will have their images used, <br>
simply because people will like their images.<br>
<p>
Advanced visual languages are a whole new field open to humanity.  We need to <br>
let it develop how it will, rather than trying to force it to be like spoken <br>
and written language.  A visual language opens up a tremendous amount of new <br>
possibilities for expression and for organizing thoughts. I think it will be <br>
more than visual, though.  I think people will be doing a lot more with their <br>
voices and with body language and being expressive with whatever they have <br>
available to them.  <br>
<p>
Language isn't mainly about conveying meaning, which is what it seems like <br>
you're assuming when you propose planning the language so that we are all <br>
consistent about what symbol means what.  Language is mainly about evoking a <br>
response in someone.  Some aspects of language involve symbols which have very <br>
specific meanings (such as in science and in mathematics), but in general, <br>
language is a way of stimulating the minds of others to think like you do.  A <br>
way of spreading memes.  Symbols are only one kind of meme.  A visual language <br>
makes use of symbols, and it also makes use of many other memes.  Different <br>
images remind us of different memories, and people use certain images when <br>
they wish to evoke certain memories in others.  Images are combined with <br>
others, or are displayed near each other to deliberately form a link between <br>
the images in the viewer's mind.<br>
<p>
Chris, the visual language is already being used, and it's been around in many <br>
forms for thousands of years.  It's not something that we have to invent and <br>
standardize.  Look at a magazine advertisement.  Watch television.  Go to the <br>
movies.  Go to an art gallery.  These are forms of the visual language.  If <br>
you wish to communicate with a visual language, develop your skills in graphic <br>
arts.  Learn to create images.<br>
<p>
So many tools are being developed now that make it much easier for people to <br>
create very high quality images and communicate them with others, that <br>
creating images is likely to eventually become as popular as making sounds.  <br>
People will then communicate much more through images than they do now.  But <br>
we will still use sound, I'm sure.  We will use words still, I'm sure.  <br>
However, tools are also being developed that allow people to generate very <br>
high quality sounds.  New sorts of musical instruments are being created that <br>
will be very powerful and versatile.  People will be able to play these <br>
instruments with data gloves, worn on their hands and connected to small, <br>
powerful computers.  Creating music is likely to become as popular as speaking <br>
is today.  People will grow competent at expressing their own emotions through <br>
the music they will be generating pretty much all the time.<br>
<p>
Conversations in the future will involve people generating images and sounds <br>
(as well as other sensations) for each other and responding to each other.  <br>
Just like some musicians now are really good at playing together, making stuff <br>
up as they go and each playing off what the other does.  This will be done <br>
with sounds and images in future conversations.  They will resemble "jam <br>
sessions", and things will be pretty intense, lots of organized information <br>
getting passed back and forth.<br>
<p>
I might create an image around us of an open meadow, and you might create <br>
flowers and trees which blossom around us.  Someone else could join in, <br>
creating a soft and beautiful melody, slowly rising and filling the air as <br>
someone makes the sun rise and adds clouds to glow with glorious color.  <br>
Someone else will contribute, with a clam deep voice, saying softly, "We wake <br>
to a new day, a day of promise, a day where we will create the fulfullment of <br>
all our deepest desires."<br>
<p>
Our dialogue would be a shared art project, each of us playing with and adding <br>
to the contributions of the others.<br>
<p>
What we choose to create is what we communicate.<br>
