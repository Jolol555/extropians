I might as well state up front that I'm just an amateur in all matters of <br>
law and economics. But I find these things interesting and have spent <br>
some time reading and thinking about them.<br>

This is indeed one of the hard problems of anarchocapitalism, possibly<br>
even harder than oft discussed problem of "national" defense. Although<br>
David Friedman's legal archeology of Iceland has contributed some ideas<br>
that are useful in thinking these things through, my own amateur take on<br>
these matters is that the problem of human predators is a very hard one<br>
(and really, it's the same problem considered in "national" defense).<br>
Thinking through wergild systems and the problem of the judgment-proof<br>
criminal, it seems to me, takes us toward the institutionalization of<br>
term-slavery or something like it for criminals, and while this *might* be<br>
preferable to the current expensive and culturally destructive system of<br>
sterile imprisonment, I think that modern society is well rid of "the<br>
peculiar institution" and I am very shy of anything that even looks like<br>
backsliding in this department. <br>
<p>
To make my long story short, I don't have any big answers, and I haven't <br>
seen any suggestions for improvement over the current arrangements that <br>
seem compelling to me. Yet I am deeply dissatisfied with the current <br>
arrangements. When faced with this sort of situation when trying to solve <br>
a personal problem by my own means, I know of no better method than to <br>
try out several different things and see which ones work better.<br>
<p>
Therefore, my only strong inclination on this question is to push for a<br>
return to *fully* local control of tort and criminal law. Since I live in<br>
the United States and it's only 1996 right now, this means that, like<br>
Harry Browne, I'm pushing for a complete removal of the Federal government<br>
from jurisdiction over tort and criminal law, so that we can at least have<br>
a chance of running 50 different experiments in legal systems as soon as<br>
possible. The direction up until recently has been opposite this, with<br>
increasing Federal involvement in criminal and tort law, and I think<br>
that needs to be reversed.<br>
<p>
Federalism is a poor substitute for full polycentric law, but perhaps it's<br>
a good start on a road that might take us there.<br>
<p>
My apologies to non-Yanks for the parochialism of this post, but the <br>
general principles of devolution of political power do seem to be making <br>
the rounds this decade.<br>
