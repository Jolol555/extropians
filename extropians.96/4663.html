<p>
Of course concentration camps didn't have gas chambers. They had showers <br>
and delousing. The latter was done mainly with Zyklon B, an I.G. Farben <br>
product, which consisted of HCN absorbed on silicagel. Lice don't like <br>
Zyklon B. Nazis were very clean and scientifically sophisticated <br>
people, they invented such drastic insecticides as soman, sarin, and tabun.<br>
(Not to forget Fritz Haber, the inventor of chemical warfare, but then, <br>
we can't give him full credit, him being a Jew, and it was earlier).<br>
<p>
Nazis also organized sight viewing for their guests, in windowless <br>
buses, with ICE exhaust air conditioning. Lice didn't like that, either.<br>
<p>
Nazis were extremely humane as well, they gave Jewish people whole <br>
cities, all for themselves ("der F"uhrer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt"). <br>
They made nice movies about that, too. Could you ask for more? They <br>
allowed Jews to volunteer for medical experiments, so that Aryan fighter <br>
pilots could better survive height asphyxation and waterings in <br>
ice-cold water. Dr. Mengele even invented twin research, back then.<br>
He also invented early heart treatments, by injecting liquid phenol <br>
intracardially. Well, it was crude.<br>
<p>
Nazis made the very best human microscopic preparates, very fresh, <br>
you see. Nazis were good engineers, too: it is difficult to calculate a <br>
crematorium oven to be self-sustaining, high water content of the human <br>
body considered. They also invented early recycling, primarily <br>
concentrating on teeth filling, and hair. Hair hydrolisate is rich in <br>
lysine. They tried producing soap either, but it wasn't economical, so <br>
they used it to impress their customers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I mean, really, WHY?</i><br>
<p>
You better ask that Fred Leuchter, he should know. Methinks he made some <br>
calculations on gas chamber throughput. Funny thing Fred is not well <br>
liked in Germany, him being so good with medical machinery and <br>
electrified furniture.<br>

ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. I have been to Dachau, they had showers/deslousing there as well. <br>
Hadn't time to use them, though.<br>
