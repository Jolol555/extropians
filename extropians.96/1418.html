IAN: I am familiar with fuzzy logic. Working on holistic logic <br>
and realizing that things are never all A or all ~A, I mapped <br>
out a bivalent truth scale and it then occurred to me that I <br>
think this may be what they call "fuzzy logic."  I ran out <br>
and got Kosko's book I realized that, "Crap, someone else <br>
already figured this out. D'oh!  There goes that nobel <br>
prize." ;^) Of course as it turns out bivalent logics<br>
were around decades ago, but Kosko has been blazing <br>
many new exciting trails.<br>
<p>
The reason holistic and multivalent logic overlap to some <br>
degree is that they both allow for the condition in which <br>
A = ~A. That's how I realized the bivalent logic table had <br>
to be scraped, thus a multivalent scale followed logically.<br>
<p>
Holistic logic and multivalent logic are different yet harmonious.<br>
<p>
What I see is that even as X is 60% A and 40% ~A, it is ALSO <br>
always 50/50, for 60% implies 40% and vice versa. 60% implies <br>
60% to a degree EQUAL to the degree that it implies 40%. Hot <br>
implies hot to a degree equal to the degree that it implies <br>
not-hot. The mutual dependence of A and ~A, is their constant <br>
equality; therefore, multivalent logic is not inconsistent<br>
with holistic logic or vice versa. <br>
<p>
Holistic logic is a principle of relational identity, while <br>
multivalent is a high resolution classification. So multivalent <br>
logic is an improved system of classifications, an improved way <br>
of describing categories of things, but it's still just language, <br>
still just human impositions on nature that fit the variant texture <br>
of nature far more effectively than bivalent. Holistic logic on the <br>
other hand tells us how things actually  are, not that fuzzy does <br>
not also do this. Obviously fuzzy logic can be demonstrated to be <br>
more utilitarian than I can now demonstrate holistic logic to be. <br>
But the two are connected: fuzzy logic is "soft-Zen," while holistic <br>
logic is "hard-core Zen" in which A always = ~A. Holistic logic <br>
does not deny fuzzy logic, while Aristotelian logic does deny fuzzy.<br>
