\It seems you've already drawn your conclusions before the experiment. I <br>
happen to think CH is on the right track, but we'll never really know for <br>
sure until we try.<br>

*sigh*<br>
<p>
Chris said "why deny the fact"...<br>
<p>
I explained why I would deny the putative fact.<br>
<p>
I am willing to concede that some transhumans will have no use for <br>
such stuff.<br>
<p>
Are such transhumans aware that there is a risk of being considered <br>
so alien as to be suspect if they have this elective personality <br>
surgery performed?<br>
<p>
Consider a simple case, without any personality surgery:<br>
<p>
Assume the sugar cube sized _Homo accelerans_ (my term, as far as I <br>
know) with a clock rate 100x normal. this means that 4 days objective <br>
is a tad over one year subjective.<br>
<p>
How different are you from the person you were a year ago? Five <br>
years ago? How much will you, as an H. accelerans, have in common <br>
with your former self in one year objective time?<br>
<p>
How is that supposed to engender trust in those with different clock <br>
speeds?<br>
<p>
If they're worried enough, what will stop them from pre-emptively <br>
nuking you?<br>
<p>
If you'e the first on your block to get cranked (my phrase), what <br>
will keep you from going stir crazy from the solitary confinement?<br>
*That* might be a good reason to have a "Vulcan mode" switch for your <br>
consciousness. But a switch, not an irrevocable dissociation, seems <br>
prudent to me.<br>
<p>
Please note that I consider myself transhuman-sympathetic and <br>
extropian-positive. I can even get along with a Randite. *but*...<br>
<p>
"We" hardly ever know anything for sure where topics like aesthetics <br>
and morals are concerned, if by "we" you mean humans as a whole. <br>
Evolutionary views of ethology etc. suggest that there is a cost <br>
associated with every evolutionary cusp. <br>
<p>
I was merely pointing out a possible cost. <br>
<p>
Your attitude, as I understand it, puts me in mind of a Robert M. <br>
Prisig quote.  I can't remember it exactly, but the gist is that <br>
people would say to him "well, you had your personality changed"... <br>
and he'd wonder if the phrase meant anything. If your personality <br>
changes, are you still you?<br>
<p>
You seem to have already made up your mind about _that_. :) :)<br>
<p>
Me, I'm not sure. I also don't know how much it matters. But I know a <br>
lot can happen in 100 sujective years. Especially if a big chunk of <br>
that is effectively solitary confinement. And if you shuck all the <br>
endocrine dross, are you still the person who signed contracts before <br>
you uploaded? Or would other people regard you as "of impaired <br>
capacity" because, in their view, you left out the parts that made <br>
you comprehensible to them?<br>
<p>
I'm struck sometimes by the parallels between the folkloric culture <br>
data we have about, e.g., the "wee folk" of the British Isles and the <br>
likely outcomes of "getting cranked". There are the kindly but <br>
inscrutable fairies, and the utterly alien and inscrutable ones. Come <br>
upload time, I think I'd prefer to be one of the former.<br>
<p>
But that's just my atavistic mammal (*not* lizard) brain talking.<br>
What does it know?  :) :)<br>
<p>
MMB, at but not for, etc.<br>
