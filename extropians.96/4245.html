<p>
<p>
But again, Brin is making 2 fundamental errors.  <br>
<p>
1) He's assuming that everyone, including chicks, will be just like him and   <br>
   equate privacy with paranoia.<br>
<p>
2) He's assuming that by some black magic everyone, including chicks, can    <br>
   tell if I'm using cryptography, but in actuality, the fact that I have a    <br>
   secret is a secret.<br>
                  <br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
Suppose I run the best small painting company in silicon valley, we can do a <br>
better job at a lower price than anyone else, but through black magic it is <br>
known that I have a secret. <br>
Do you really think INTEL wouldn't hire my company to paint the outside of <br>
their new chip manufacturing plant? <br>
And if they did hire me, do you really think IBM would not buy INTEL chips? <br>
And if they did buy INTEL chips do you really think COMP USA would not sell <br>
IBM computers in their stores? <br>
And if they did sell IBM computers would you really stop going to COMP USA?<br>
And if you did go to COMP USA should I really start shunning you?<br>
                      <br>

Sounds like a splendid place to live, I can hardly wait.<br>

A VERY big subject, I've written quite a lot about it, I'm not sure if it's  <br>
in the archives or not, lots about it on Cypherpunks too. Although written  <br>
20 years before the term was coined, "The Machinery Of Freedom" by David  <br>
Friedman is required reading. Wonderful book!!!  To give you a flavor of what<br>
I'm talking about I'll show you  The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto  by former  <br>
Extropian list member Tim May. <br>

=============================================================<br>
<p>
                The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto           <br>
                       <br>
                            by<br>
<p>
                       Timothy C. May<br>
                       <br>
<p>
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.<br>
<p>
Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for<br>
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each<br>
other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange<br>
messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts<br>
without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the<br>
other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via<br>
extensive rerouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes<br>
which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect<br>
assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central<br>
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit<br>
ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the<br>
nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control<br>
economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret,<br>
and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.<br>
<p>
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a<br>
social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the<br>
past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption,<br>
zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software<br>
protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The<br>
focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and<br>
the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security<br>
Agency. But only recently have computer networks and  personal<br>
computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas<br>
practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough<br>
additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and<br>
essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof<br>
boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band transmitters,<br>
multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under<br>
development will be some of the enabling technologies.<br>
<p>
The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this<br>
technology, citing national security concerns, use of the<br>
technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of<br>
societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid;<br>
crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely<br>
and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An<br>
anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent<br>
markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and<br>
foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this<br>
will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.<br>
<p>
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power<br>
of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will<br>
cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of<br>
corporations and of government interference in economic<br>
transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto<br>
anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material<br>
which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a<br>
seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the<br>
fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the<br>
concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so<br>
too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch<br>
of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the<br>
barbed wire around intellectual property. Arise, you have<br>
nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!<br>
<p>
===============================================================<br>
                       <br>
                       <br>
<i>                &gt;We would have a pure democracy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
What a nightmare!<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I suspect he's listening in. (Hi Mr. Brin!) If not he's                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;missing out on some good source material for his book                 </i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
Brin wants to write his book in an intellectual cocoon, isolated from any <br>
disturbing ideas that might chalange his own. This may work for an adventure  <br>
novel but not for a work of non fiction, as a result, I predict he will end <br>
up writing something with all the profundity of your average pop up book. <br>
