<i>&gt;If they can be whipped into a "holy furor"</i><br>
<i>&gt;over something that doesn't yet exist, they can be ridiculed the way that</i><br>
<i>&gt;serious opposition to genetic research was in the late 70's.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tell a populace that they "shouldn't" or "can't" do something, and you will</i><br>
<i>&gt;find them flocking to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robert Maplethorpe's exhibitions would have been little noticed events save</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the efforts of the opposition to them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the opposition bases its case largely on the Book of Revelation rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than serious discussion of the downsides of nanotech, and the social</i><br>
upheavals<br>
<i>&gt;it will cause, then much of the battle will have been ceded to the pro nano</i><br>
<i>&gt;side.</i><br>
<p>
*VERY* good point! Lets stir up some contravercy shall we? We could take it<br>
a step further and claim that if christianity considers science satan than<br>
we could revel in the fact that we're satan worshippers!<br>
