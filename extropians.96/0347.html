Could rational logical thought be considered a Memetic Immune System for<br>
destructive memes such as the great religions of the world. If so then I<br>
would have a STRONG meme immune system being forced as a kid to go to church<br>
against my will, having a mother as a church secretary who also ran a bible<br>
study as well as a highly christian extended family and being able to debunk<br>
it all through logical reasoning and rationalization.<br>
