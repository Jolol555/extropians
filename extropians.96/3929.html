<p>
I just re-read this thread from the archives, and I hope it won’t die<br>
out just<br>
because Brin bailed on it. I didn’t find good evidence in any of the<br>
given<br>
arguments to support any firm conclusions, but it seems to me that<br>
Brin’s ideas<br>
on privacy hold some merit. Postulating a society in which everyone is<br>
capable<br>
of tuning in to everyone else’s lives on a real time, or archived basis,<br>
I predict the following:<br>
<p>
1.)  Society will be able to enforce all of its rules more easily.<br>
<p>
2.)  Those who will be held most accountable for any rule breaking<br>
actions<br>
will be those who generate the most public interest - politicians, media<br>
stars,<br>
the rich, etc… as they will be constantly watched by many.<br>
<p>
3.)   Since the people mentioned in #2 are those who generally create<br>
(or<br>
strongly influence the creation of) the rules, rules against common<br>
actions<br>
will decrease. (Hypocrisy decreases.) <br>
<p>
4.)  General acceptance of the differences between people and<br>
understanding of<br>
their similarities becomes hard to avoid with increased exposure, and<br>
this<br>
decreases rules against less common actions. (Tolerance increases.)<br>
<p>
Whether this easing of rules combined with tighter enforcement would<br>
balance<br>
out to leave us more/less/or the same individual freedom, I can not say,<br>
but<br>
its a great answer to the question "Who watches the watchmen?"<br>
<p>
If you would like to continue this debate, I’d be happy to argue Brin’s<br>
point.<br>
<p>
In answer to your question, johnkc:<br>
<p>
Certainly secret ballot would disappear, but would it be needed? Any<br>
action<br>
taken against someone based on the way they voted would be public<br>
knowledge,<br>
and a society which would tolerate such when it was exposed, probably<br>
wouldn't<br>
have a voting process anyway.<br>
