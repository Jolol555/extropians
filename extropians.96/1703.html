Yes there are lots of ways to handle problems without laws, especially<br>
via informal social mechanisms (See Bensons' "Order Without Law").  <br>
But I'd also like to make sure everyone remembers that you can have<br>
law without government.  Private law, explicit but voluntarily agreed<br>
on.  Just because "there aught to be a law" doesn't mean there aught<br>
to be coersion.<br>
