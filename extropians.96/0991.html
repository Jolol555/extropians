In one of his books (Breakfast of Champions I think, but it's been a<br>
long time) a new crystaline form of water is made or discovered, which<br>
is solid at room tempurature.  It "freezes" any water that comes in<br>
contact with it.  The world ends.<br>
<p>
<p>
Of course, this is just a plot device: the book isn't "about" that at<br>
all.  Highly recommended.<br>
