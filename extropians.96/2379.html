My experiences agree quite well with this, I also feel like a society of <br>
subsystems from time to time. One of the more fascinating ways of <br>
liberating your creativity is to call them to a meeting and brainstorm.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't call them personalities, I prefer subminds, since most lack <br>
clear personality (although they might develop it). By concentrating on <br>
them, naming them and thinking of them they can become more individual.<br>
<p>
As I see it, it is an useful exercise to tear down the illusion of "one <br>
mind in one brain", it gives you a much healthier view of yourself and <br>
your behavior. At the same time, it is important to be able to cohere <br>
into a single being too when needed - maybe one could develop exercises <br>
for this? <br>

<p>
My guess is that posthuman beings will be constructed in roughly the same <br>
way, although the subminds may be of human or greater intelligence and <br>
contain subsubminds, and so on. <br>

<i>&gt; That's just the way things are for us.  If our internal organization </i><br>

<p>
A very good definition. I usually define something as "disease" or <br>
"unhealth" if it limits the victim's possibilities - if it instead <br>
enhances them it is good. <br>
