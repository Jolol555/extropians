According to what I read, no. The previous record was about a third of that<br>
speed. As reported in the Advances section of Extropy #17, the record as of<br>
April of this year was a mere 281 gigaflops. It may have gone a bit higher<br>
between then and the Intel announcement. I believe the news story I read<br>
said the Japanese record was around 360 gigaflops.<br>
<p>
The completed Intel machine (made entirely from Pentium Pro microprocessors)<br>
will be several times faster than the announced result. A 10-teraflops<br>
machine is expected by 2001. The ASCI folks reckon we may ahve a<br>
500-teraflops machine by 2005. If fast hardware was all that was needed,<br>
according to Moravec we should have uploading in just a few years. But of<br>
course that's the *easy* part.<br>
