Greg Burch says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This may be a mere word game, but since property rights are obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamental to more concrete transactions, what am I missing?</i><br>
<p>
While I, too, have mused that contract rights presuppose property rights, I<br>
trace the property at issue to a core notion of self-ownership.  Contract<br>
presupposes property because it relies on the self-ownership of the<br>
contracting parties.  Self-owners can, of course, own real and personal<br>
property such as acres of land and cars, and can, of course, contract for the<br>
disposition of such ancillary types of property.  But I regard neither real<br>
nor personal property as fundamental, since neither necessarily implies<br>
control.  Rather, control of such ancillary types of property comes grace of<br>
proximity, practice, and legal right.<br>
<p>
Self-ownership seems different.  I own me because I alone control me.  Or,<br>
more precisely, I control me more effectively than can any other person.<br>
