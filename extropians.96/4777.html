<i>&gt;If a limited list has inherent value, why not take the obvious,</i><br>
<i>&gt;simple, and fair approach of charging for it?  Only those with</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough serious interest to participate and support the list would</i><br>
<i>&gt;join, and that level of participation could be adjusted by price.</i><br>
<p>
It's been tried. I suspect a transaction-costs problem here. The<br>
various petty expenses involved in simply administering such a <br>
scheme more than consumed the value yielded by the list membership<br>
fees (although only indirectly, because most of the expenses involved<br>
were covered with volunteer labor... but that leads us to the worry<br>
of unnecessary burnout of valuable ExI volunteers, a scarce resource<br>
we need to harbor).<br>
<p>
Of course, fees could be raised, but even the small fee that ExI<br>
once charged for this list drastically escalated the standard of<br>
service to which ExI was held, and again it must be remembered that<br>
the services were being provided, for the most part, by volunteers.<br>
I just don't see a commercially viable price point for the market<br>
for this list at this point in time.<br>
<p>
A further point to be considered is that during the time that a <br>
fee was required for the list, we lost a number of valuable <br>
contributors, some of whom have since returned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The official sanction of the Extropy institute is a valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt;commodity for such a list, and I think it would be immoral not</i><br>
<i>&gt;to profit from that, and to give the institute itself complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom to sanction and do business with whomever they choose.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If they do a bad job, well then let the free market create</i><br>
<i>&gt;another list to do better.</i><br>
<p>
We might take a hint from the market in observing the fact that<br>
profitable paid-subscription email lists are rare. I would <br>
guess that this will become a thriving segment of the information<br>
market sometime in the next twenty years, but I don't think conditions<br>
are quite ripe for it yet.<br>
<p>
Of course it's exciting to pioneer emerging market segments, but it's<br>
also wise to keep in mind that the pioneers are often the ones lying<br>
around with arrows sticking out of their backs.<br>
