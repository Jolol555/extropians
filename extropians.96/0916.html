<i>&gt; Steric means the space filling properties of a molecule. If all molecules had </i><br>
<i>&gt; an exact shape and were perfectly rigid, things would be pretty </i><br>
<p>
Often, measurement of atom sizes are compared to measuring a grapefruit <br>
with a pair of calipers: the size determined depends on pressure applied.<br>
Repulsion component gets exponentially up with increased squeeze, though, <br>
so the grapefruit kernel turns (almost) infinitely incompressible (at least <br>
for room temperature conditions, at several MK fusion can occur) very soon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; straightforward, but of course they are not, a Nanotechnology engineer would </i><br>
<i>&gt; ignore this at his peril. It's not always a disadvantage however, just as in</i><br>
<p>
Most often it is a disadvantage, e.g. consider the space cone occupied by <br>
the STM tip + cantilever. There is complementary demand for not blocking <br>
out access to the site &amp; for the maximum mechanical rigidity of the tip <br>
itself and support structure. If one thinks of the suface deposited ("3d <br>
nanolithography printer"), which shields access to the reaction site, the <br>
problems are obviously nontrivial. E.g. trying to access the same site with <br>
two or more tips is obviously _very_ difficult, so a hollow tip would be <br>
nice, but this has negative impact upon tip solidity... (btw Heckl's group <br>
in Munich has recently learned to fabricate hollow tubes with a few nm <br>
inner channel aperture, which are _not_ buckytubes. It's not in the press, <br>
yet).<br>
<p>
The tube approach suggests "molecular Gatling guns" (thanks, Jason), <br>
where an inert precursor gets activated (e.g. by a laser pulse or a <br>
electrical field spike) i.e. turned into a reactive moiety only shortly <br>
before use, repeated in a rapid succession.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; our Macro world, if something doesn't quite fit you can often give it a good </i><br>
<i>&gt; whack and make it fit. Chemists also have a term called "Steric Hindrance", </i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, a hard enough whack will rupture bonds. Additionally, e.g. <br>
blue or UV light bear sufficient energy to (photo)dissotiate bonds, if <br>
absorbed. You kill your circuitry if you look at it too sharply. This <br>
requires molecular circuitry to be shielded from shortwave radition, either <br>
by using red-orange-greenish light and/or embedding it in shielding matrix, <br>
e.g. engineered proteins. The matrix is needed for autoassembly anyway, <br>
so it's convenient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it refers to the slowing of a chemical reaction because some part of a </i><br>
<i>&gt; molecule mechanically gets in the way. This is very important in large </i><br>
<p>
Interspecies reactions require collisions. E.g. methane is kinetically <br>
inert in oxygen up to certain temperature/pressure, since it is <br>
spherically shielded by four hydrogens. An instable molecule can be often <br>
stabilized, if more bulky residues are substituted for the original ones. <br>
Another instance of it is crystal lattice photochemistry, which typically <br>
yields different products from the solvated ones. Reactive species are <br>
often made infinetely stable by embeddinig them in inert matrix, e.g. <br>
argon under cryogenic conditions. Stuff must be diluted, but it's usually <br>
enough to be seen by spectroscopy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; biological molecules and depending on the circumstances it can be a help or a </i><br>
<i>&gt; hindrance to the Nanotechnology engineer, but either way he must have a </i><br>
<p>
Mostly, it's hindrance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; understanding of it. There is a lot more about it in Nanosystems.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. A worthwhile book to read, though a bit laconic on chemistry.<br>
