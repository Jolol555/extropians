Lyle, don't insult me in public with lies in this way. I will not<br>
permit this. If you think the question of math people snooting it<br>
over humanities people is private business between you and me and<br>
not an extremely common and general phenomenon on the list, well,<br>
you're wrong. And if you think that I should limit my comments<br>
about public affairs only to those things that I have *not* recently<br>
discussed in private with you, then you drastically overestimate<br>
your importance to my life. Believe it or not, Lyle, you are not<br>
the center of the universe.<br>
<p>
You are also incorrect in that my comments have nothing to do with<br>
"the point about causality". I thought my answer was straightforward<br>
and direct. Just because you minored in classics doesn't necessarily<br>
mean that you understand rhetoric. If you don't think that words<br>
(and setting an example) have a physical, causal effect on human<br>
brains, and if you don't think that it is human brains (all six<br>
billion of them) that run the world, I don't know what else to tell<br>
you.<br>
<p>
You are the one who brought private business onto the list, in the<br>
paragraph I've quoted above. I'd like an apology. Knowing you, I<br>
don't expect to get one, but I always enjoy pleasant surprises.<br>
