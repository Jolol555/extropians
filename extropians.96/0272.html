An obvious candidate for a "conspiracy THEY want you to believe" is<br>
The X-Files.  In fact, even before that show, the number of shows where<br>
the government insider (often a government employee) valiantly tries to<br>
unearth and undermine a conspiracy involving paranormal stuff was starting<br>
to (so to speak) bug me.<br>

 How many times have you fallen in love with a lyric that you thought went,<br>
    "Show me a day with Hilda Ogden and I'll despair,"<br>
 only to find out that it went,<br>
    "Show me a way to solve your problems and I'll be there."  --Seal<br>
