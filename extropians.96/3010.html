TWA might have paid attention to what happened to Pan American Air Lines.<br>
<p>
Remember Pan Am?<br>
<p>
Here is the *unverified* story I heard of how Pan Am ceased to exist:<br>
<p>
After Pan Am's flight is blown up over Scotland, Pan Am hires their own<br>
investigators, who conclude that the flight (which contained many<br>
high-ranking CIA operatives) was blown up by members of a different group of<br>
CIA operatives, as part of an intra-agency power struggle.  <br>
<p>
Pan Am files suit in federal court asking for damages from the CIA.<br>
<p>
Next thing you know, Pan Am's lines of credit are withdrawn, they are<br>
declared bankrupt, and the court-appointed bankrupcy trustee withdraws the suit.<br>
<p>
If this is true, there should be some traces in the historical record, and<br>
the message would not be lost on TWA... <br>
