<i>&gt;  Now, the virtual reality </i><br>
<i>&gt;that people usually talk about only provides sensory experience, so if you </i><br>
<i>&gt;were thinking, "this isn't real; it's only virtual reality," THAT THINKING </i><br>
<i>&gt;might lessen the experience for you, but if you jumped right in, which you </i><br>
<i>&gt;probably would, since we're so accustomed to just accepting our sensory </i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences as the real world anyway, it would seem entirely real.  But you </i><br>
<i>&gt;COULD lessen the impact it had on you by constantly reminding yourself that it </i><br>
<i>&gt;was "only" virtual reality.  So, for example, you could have a sexual </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience with someone in very advanced virtual reality, and if you didn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;keep reminding yourself that it was virtual reality it would seem just as real </i><br>
<i>&gt;and wonderful as it would in real life.  In fact, you wouldn't be able to tell </i><br>
<i>&gt;the difference.</i><br>
<p>
Very true, cuz if they convinced themselves it isn't real they'd notice<br>
every little pixel out of place or would notice some aspect where the VR<br>
isn't perfect and pick it to pieces.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But of course, they'll </i><br>
<i>&gt;dismiss the idea as being interesting, yes, but most likely not true, just </i><br>
<i>&gt;like you're doing right now.  In fact, their belief system would probably be </i><br>
<i>&gt;very similar to yours; they might even think they really are you.  And no </i><br>
<i>&gt;matter how much anyone tried to convice them that their entire reality was </i><br>
<i>&gt;simulated, they would think the entire notion just as ridiculous as you would </i><br>
<i>&gt;right now if I told you that your reality is a computer simulation.</i><br>
<p>
Couldn't this be the problem with schizophrenics living in their own little<br>
worlds?<br>
