<i>&gt;Of course, a more worrying possibility is that we take them for granted</i><br>
<i>&gt;and don't see them. One way to find out, is to think about the last time </i><br>
<i>&gt;you discussed extropianism with somebody and got angry at their </i><br>
<i>&gt;arguments - sacred cows tend to hide near such sore spots. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We are living in a culture that is </i><br>
<i>&gt;becoming more and more risk-avoiding every day. </i><br>
<p>
Does being uncomfortable about doing something count as a sacred cow? For<br>
example I would've loved to go to one of the extropian meetings, parties,<br>
whatever but I am hesitant on the point of wondering how the people on this<br>
list actually are personality wise and not solely through intellectual<br>
debate. For some reason I get this creepy vision of some bizarre occult<br>
group when I try to envision an extropian gathering although I know that it<br>
is completely the opposite. This idea gnaws at me and I hate it. Perhaps I<br>
need to discuss this with some of the list members over the phone (anders?)<br>
and sort things out.<br>
