<i>&gt;The August '96 issue of Wired says that "the US is built on a US$7 </i><br>
<i>&gt;trillion economic engine, only $300 billion of which is in cash."</i><br>
<i>&gt;What will happen when cash is replaced by private cash cards (cards which </i><br>
<i>&gt;use encryption to allow private transfer of electronic cash which exists </i><br>
<i>&gt;only as bits on the cash card).  Would these bits still have to mean </i><br>
<i>&gt;something?  Would the government still have to say how much money exists </i><br>
<i>&gt;in "cash" even if that cash is only made up of bits?</i><br>
<p>
Here are the important properties of the pieces of green paper we<br>
carry in our wallets that I can think of offhand.  Additions are<br>
welcome; I hope to learn something here.<br>
<p>
1. Supply is limited.  Only the government can counterf..., er, print<br>
   more of them in significant quantities in practice, and there are<br>
   political repurcussions that keep them from doing that too freely.<br>
2. They are good for paying taxes and many existing debts and contracts, such<br>
   as mortgages, cable bills, phone bills, etc.<br>
3. They are more-or-less freely exchangeable.<br>
4. They are durable enough that they probably won't become unusable<br>
   while they're in my pocket.<br>
<p>
Does money have to have any other properties?  Whether it's green<br>
paper or bits seems unimportant.  Checking account balances have most<br>
of the above properties, except the bank gets to do controlled amounts<br>
of counterfeiting too (the sum of the account balances generally<br>
far exceeds the money the bank has on hand).<br>
<p>
The vast majority of money is bits already.  Most people don't have<br>
most of their wealth as green paper; it's in account balances and<br>
equity of various kinds.<br>
