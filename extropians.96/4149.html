<i>&gt;  I didn't realize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there was any semblence of 'constructed gender differences' on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; list; if such is true, then I truly don't understand what these differences</i><br>
<i>&gt; are.  Perhaps that is your point.  As for overcoming such possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences, I think a dose of *reality* would do the trick.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Unless the individuals involved have made themselves aware of the <br>
effects of gender socialization on their speech patterns, body <br>
language, negotiation and social styles, then these differences will <br>
always have an effect on human interactions.  This does not represent <br>
prejudice or misogyny per se, but if one person does not provide the <br>
expected cues and signals as per their gender (usually women), the other <br>
person (man or woman) can react with annoyance or even anger.  A lot <br>
of it has to do with social power dynamics, which can change with the <br>
situation or the culture.  It's a complex and fascinating subject.<br>
<p>
I became interested in the subject of constructed gender at a young <br>
age, being *just* androgynous enough to pass as a guy depending on <br>
what I wore and how short I cut my hair.  After some lessons in body <br>
language from actor friends, I've spent time as both man and woman, <br>
and this has led me to conclude that society's insistence on gender role <br>
divisions is a form of entropy that holds back everyone, men and <br>
women alike.  This is a prime area for personal evolution (and for <br>
discovering more freedom of expression). <br>
<p>
There is a lot of good writing on this subject (with the notable <br>
exception of _Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus) but one caution <br>
to anyone looking up papers.  A huge number of studies were based on the <br>
BEM sex instrument, a self-identification instrument that has <br>
recently come under heavy criticism for being too culturally <br>
weighted.  It is indicative that more and more people register as <br>
'androgynous' on the instrument, and it will either have to be <br>
revised or scrapped altogether.<br>
