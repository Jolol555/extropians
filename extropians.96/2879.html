In my own experience this relationship *does* exist. Certainly I have<br>
experienced rudeness in privately-owned stores (in England, people working<br>
in many shops seemed generally to ignore customers more commonly that I've<br>
experienced here in California), and I've been treated decently in<br>
government-run establishments.<br>
<p>
However, *all* of the extremely bad experiences I've had have been in<br>
government places: a truly horrible exchange on the border of Calfornia and<br>
Mexico. That time I really had to struggle to avoid punching the other<br>
person (and I'm *not* a violent person!). I've had two or three nasty<br>
experiences with immigration-type government agencies. In the case of *real*<br>
services (i.e. not as in "Internal Revenue Service") run by the state (Post<br>
Office, etc.) I can't say I've had much worse treatment than in private<br>
business. Most bad experiences have been due to imcompetence and slowness<br>
rather than malevolence.<br>
<p>
Lyle, if we separate state agencies like IRS, INS, and the rest, from<br>
government services, would you say state agencies were ruder than private<br>
businesses?<br>
