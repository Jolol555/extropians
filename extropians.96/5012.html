<i>&gt;I have lived in crack neighborhoods.  Most of the problems were do the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that crack users could not afford their habit.  If cocaine were legal</i><br>
<i>&gt;it would be dirt cheap and not provoke the robbery, gang warfare, slavery,</i><br>
<i>&gt;kidnapping, forced prostitution, crack houses, destruction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;neighborhoods, etc. that it does now. [By the way, it is the brutal police</i><br>
<i>&gt;raids on "crack houses" that destroys most of the property!]</i><br>
<p>
Crack _is_ dirt cheap.  Cocaine may cost hundreds -- crack costs maybe $5<br>
per "rock" (which I think is a single dose -- it may be more).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;People who use too much and go "raving paranoid" would be primarily a</i><br>
<i>&gt;danger only to themselves and those who choose to associate with them.</i><br>
<p>
It's not so neat or so fair as that.  What about the unfortunate people<br>
who happen to be on the bus, train, or street, or in the store or post<br>
office or bank, or wherever such people show up and start shooting<br>
everybody in sight?  Also, you may underestimate the strength of bonds<br>
of love (familial and romantic), of codependency, even of friendship.<br>
"It's their own fault" is disturbingly easy to say.<br>
