<i>&gt; Here's a situation analogous to the shooting room where the probabilities are</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I hope) more clear.  Suppose we have an atom with thirty six possible </i><br>
<i>&gt; orientations, each with equal probability to be found (a made up quanton).  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From these atoms we're going to build inverted two-dimensional ziggurats.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Each layer will be contain a factor of ten times as many atoms as the one </i><br>
<i>&gt; below it. (a factor of three in the figure below)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     xxxxxxxxx	</i><br>
<i>&gt;        xxx	</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	x</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We'll build layer by layer, and measure the orientation of the atom on the far</i><br>
<i>&gt; right end of the layer after finishing a layer.  If we measure the 36th </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible orientation for that atom, we'll stop building.  Suppose we have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinite supply of these x atoms to build with.  Surely what orientation we</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure has nothing to with how many atoms are left, or even the fact that </i><br>
<i>&gt; we're building a funny looking object.</i><br>
<p>
This doesn't quite work as an analogy, because in the shooting room,<br>
all observers see the same result when we roll our dice.  So for your<br>
atom model to work, we have to assume that all the atoms in each row<br>
have the same orientation.  Maybe there is some quantum coupling between<br>
them which forces them all into the same state.<br>
<p>
So when we measure the 36th orientation and we stop, we know that all the<br>
atoms in the top row have that orientation.  It follows that 90% of all<br>
the atoms we have produced will be of this type.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From another message:</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think all this means (according to classical probability) is that if</i><br>
<i>&gt; this experiment (an entire sequence of getting people and rolling and gettting</i><br>
<i>&gt; more people until the sixes are rolled being one experiment) is conducted an</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinite number of times, then any person will be in the room at the point the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sixes are rolled in 90% of the experiments.  The underlying reason of course</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that more you have a higher probability of being in a large group than</i><br>
<i>&gt; a small group, a priori.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	This is no contradiction to the 1/36 probability.  Saying that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a 1/36 probability of seeing sixes if you are in presently in the room </i><br>
<i>&gt; refers to a different set of experiments, namely gathering a bunch of people in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a room and rolling the dice.  In 1/36 of these (infinitely repeated) </i><br>
<i>&gt; experiments double sixes will be rolled (how many people are in the room is</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrelevant.)  What has happened is we've gained more information.  Before the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiment starts we don't know which group we're in, but once we actually do</i><br>
<i>&gt; know the probability is 1/36.</i><br>
<p>
I think you are saying here that you agree that in the shooting room<br>
experiment as I described it, the observers would be justified in expecting<br>
to see the double sixes with 90% probability.  But if did another kind<br>
of experiment where we just put some people in a room and rolled some<br>
dice, in that case we'd be back to 1/36.<br>
<p>
It still seems strange to me to imagine being one of the people in<br>
the shooting room.  I am about to watch someone roll a perfectly fair<br>
pair of dice, yet I expect this totally unlikely outcome to occur with<br>
90% probability!  It seems almost magical, as though an unseen hand is<br>
reaching out to manipulate the rolling dice and bring them up double<br>
sixes.<br>
