} Not sure what you mean.  One meaning of "apology" is explanation.  One<br>
} useful things.  But in this thread they actually weren't to the point.<br>
<p>
"Extropy is the idea of actively pushing for a better future."  You said<br>
it; presumably you wished to communicate something with it.  By itself,<br>
it communicates very little, because 'better' means "higher up in some<br>
scale of value".  Rather vague if the scale and values are undefined.<br>
This isn't a requirement you can "get over"; it is imposed by your<br>
desire to communicate to someone else.  And the problem isn't their lack<br>
of understanding; it's what you haven't said.<br>
<p>
Now, given this list, and the use of the word "extropy", I probably know<br>
what you meant.  But really, any meaning there is held in the context of<br>
the list and the word 'extropy' itself; the rest of the sentence served<br>
no function.<br>
<p>
}   X: Some extropians seem to want to be non-human rather than trans-human.<br>
}   Y: Trans-human is necessarily non-human to some extent, and you're being<br>
}      intolerant.<br>
}   Me: No, by "non-human," X meant lacking important essential human stuff.<br>
}      That's valuing, not intolerance.  To me, extropy means improvement.<br>
}   Z: You can't call someone non-extropian because they don't share your<br>
}      values.<br>
}   Me: I only meant that not-valuing, going along with whatever happens, is<br>
}      not what extropian means to *me*.<br>
} <br>
} So the original point was whether it's okay (and clear) to use "non-human"<br>
} as a derogatory term, without defining what one means exactly.  I think<br>
} it is, but today (walking down the hall at work) I realized I've seen it<br>
<p>
*shrug*  It is okay for you.  Some people will consider shedding some<br>
parts of humanity to _be_ an improvement.  So by your own definition,<br>
those non-human aspirants are as extropian as you.  I guess I wouldn't<br>
have said what Y said above.<br>
<p>
I have nothing against values, or expressing values.  I seem to get to<br>
take Rich's place as vocal subjectivist.  But expressing a difference in<br>
values doesn't have to be derogatory -- shouldn't be, unless you're<br>
actively trying to control someone else's values.<br>
