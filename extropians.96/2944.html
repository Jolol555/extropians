<i>&gt; &gt;Yes there are members who have not been properly "taken care of". Many</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;or only view it as a way to get free education, or try to use the system</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for personal aggrandizement. I've witnessed flase harassment cases</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;personally. Not against myself, but against others. I was the key</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;witness in a case in which two female airmen framed a male airman with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;such claims. If I had not overheard them talking about it beforehand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;his life would be over.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I saw this twice in my relatively short military career.  I too was witness</i><br>
<i>&gt; in one incident that the charges were intentionally fabricated.  The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; with women in the military is that too many of them *don't want* to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; treated on an equal basis with the men.  They want a civilian life plus a</i><br>
<i>&gt; uniform.  The much lower standards for women in the military only aggravates</i><br>
<i>&gt; and encourages this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I am not saying the truth may not come out. If some agency with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;equivalent power shows an interest in invesigating this in earnest, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can guarrantee that any witnesses will come out of the woodwork. Until</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;such a time, the operating rule among lower ranking people is: COVER</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;YOUR ASS, SQUEAKY WHEELS GET TOSSED OVERBOARD, and WHISTLE BLOWERS GET</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;IT JAMMED DOWN THEIR THROATS. I've been there, done that, I know what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;am talking about. Anyone with a tale to tell needs a lot of cover</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;overhead to make it home.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is very true.  The military takes care of its own, and generally runs</i><br>
<i>&gt; on its own set of rules.  Political or judicial action rarely has any impact</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the fundamental SOPs and culture of military life.  You're either in all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way or you won't last.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aren't that competent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;US military personnel are not your regular government employees.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; That's true, but we are talking about the military *plus* other government</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; agencies.  I am hardly convinced that Bill Clinton loves, respects, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; would protect the U.S. military.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But he loves himself and his own power far more than the Constitution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;experienced. What is left?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A missile would leave significant residue traces if it impacted on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; plane.  If the missile was proximity fused, it would leave a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; identifiable signature on parts of the plane due to the nature of proximity</i><br>
<i>&gt; detonations.  Since it has not been mentioned anywhere, I will assume that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; proximity detonating missile did not bring down the plane.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Navy's Standard missile (presumably the one used this scenario) most</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely uses a large composite warhead of RDX and TNT, both of which leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant chemical traces, especially TNT.  However, no significant traces</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been found of any explosive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Essentially all military explosives are detectable both by explosive</i><br>
<i>&gt; detection hardware (like TNC) and residue traces.  Therefore, assuming that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the facts available are correct and true, then military explosives are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved.  This would significantly lessen the possibility that the military</i><br>
<i>&gt; was directly involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; HYPOTHESIS:  There are much lesser known classes of explosives which 1) are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not detectable via normal explosive detection hardware, and 2) do not leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemical traces normally associated with explosives.  This would force the</i><br>
<i>&gt; general requirement that the explosive was loaded on to the plane, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; delivered by missile.  This would also generally show significant intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since these explosives would require custom manufacture by a knowledgeable</i><br>
<i>&gt; explosive chemist.  In turn, this would imply a bit more intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; resourcefulness than your average terrorist.  If you suspect the government,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sandia NL could easily produce the required compounds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Actually, there is an anti air missile with very little explosive. The<br>
Sea Sparrow uses a warhead with a proximity fuse which is little more<br>
than a very tightly coiled spiral spring (like in clocks). This sort of<br>
device would explode outside the plane, far enough to eliminate any<br>
possibility of residue showing up on the plane peices, and would simply<br>
slice into the body of the aircraft. <br>
<p>
In this scenario, since the Sea Sparrow is a radar guided missile, it<br>
would hit a plane amidships, where the return radar signal is greatest<br>
(right where the explosion happened), already "sprung", and would slice<br>
into the fuel tank so violently that an explosion would result from<br>
ignited fumes.<br>
<p>
There you go, a missile attack with no bomb residue.<br>
