<i>&gt; BREAKTHROUGH:  I finally _agree_ with you on something.  Thank you for this</i><br>
<i>&gt; wonderful decentralization idea.  The only problem is you did NOT go FAR</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You have hit on a very good point: 100% decentralization.</i><br>
<p>
Yes indeed.  And as I'm sure many will have noted, 100% decentralization<br>
results in exactly the kind of individual freedom and responsibility that<br>
we have been talking about in the threads on individual freedom.  Since<br>
politics is ultimately about coercion, it's not really surprising that<br>
we're back to this subject.  (Please let's discard the rose-tinted notion<br>
that "nice" western capitalist democracies are not about coercion:  just<br>
try stepping outside of the accepted envelope to find out how "nice" and<br>
open-minded they can be.)<br>
<p>
Capitalism and Socialism can be both just as bad as each other when<br>
viewed from an individualistic perspective:  one doesn't have to look<br>
far afield in the world to find bad examples of each, so one shouldn't<br>
attribute good or bad to one or the other on the basis of examples.<br>
<p>
At the end of the day, any system of government that believes in a<br>
collective standard is inherently coercive by design, and that applies<br>
to all existing forms of government.  In general, the only collective<br>
unit that will perform in the way that meets one's own need is oneself.<br>
And that of course is the basis for denying government altogether.<br>
