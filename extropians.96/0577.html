They wouldn't be very useful; if they are utterly unintelligent they are <br>
not better than industrial robots (and much weaker and more expensive), <br>
and if they have more brain power we get into tricky ethical questions <br>
about when they become deserving of human rights (I usually say they <br>
deserve them when they can demand them). Making these drones will <br>
probably be rather expensive and take some time (a few years of <br>
maturation, at least). The only use I can see of them is making clones of <br>
ourselves with no brains, intended as organ donors. <br>
<p>

<p>
Doesn't this depend more on what we use it for than the act itself? I <br>
know some people regard the genome as sacrosanct, but I doubt many on <br>
this list does. <br>
