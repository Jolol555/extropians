I will try to address directly one challenge which David Brin makes:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; In fact, they cannot cite a single example from human history in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; freedom was enhanced by selling masks and chadors to the poor.  But you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; point to ANY occasion when freedom increased in the world, and I'll show</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that it happened in direct correlation with increased ability by the masses</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to see what the mighty were doing.   Zero percent versus 100 percent is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; pretty damn devastating.  As a protection of freedom, secrecy is no match</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; for transparency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, it would be interesting to hear what David has to say about this</i><br>
<i>&gt;in more detail.  I would like to see some specific examples of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;100 percent correlation.  Perhaps his forthcoming book will discuss this.</i><br>
<p>
I'll make it simple, Hal.  Name a free society, any time, anywhere, in<br>
humanity's history.  Rank them in order.  I'll show you that the<br>
correlative factor was nearly always how well  people could hold their<br>
leaders accountable, while personal secrecy varied according to culture and<br>
technology, almost at right angles to freedom.  Scandinavians, for<br>
instance, have high freedom, high courtesy, low nosiness... and rather low<br>
degrees of personal secrecy.  Any citizen can look up a lot of info about<br>
his/her neighbors.  Nudity is common, etc.  things were much the same in<br>
the oldest democracy, Iceland.<br>
<p>
In fact, there were renaissances in which personal secrecy was almost<br>
nonexistent.  The golden age of Athens featured a democracy without even<br>
the secret ballot.  Everyone knew everyone else's dirty laundry.  It was<br>
very imperfect, yet they were free compared to all that came before them.<br>
<p>
Go ahead.  Stop the mantras and self-hypnotic droning catechism about<br>
privacy being this and freedom being that.... It's exactly the sort of<br>
word-hypnotism used by the Marxists, who could "logically" prove the<br>
righteousness of their cause eleventy seven days from sunday.  I don't give<br>
a rat's$%&amp;^%$% about that.  SHOW ME!   Name an example from human history<br>
of a society that was free.  Name ten.  Let's compare what pragmatically<br>
worked!\\<br>
<p>
In THIS democracy, it is was and always has been accountability.  Something<br>
you have never once even tried to dispute.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let me briefly explain what I see as the relationship between the concepts</i><br>
<i>&gt;of privacy and freedom.  This is not intended as an exhaustive or detailed</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition, but just a broad description.  Privacy generally refers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;my having control over information about myself; freedom refers to my</i><br>
<i>&gt;control over my own actions.  The two concepts are closely analogous, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;referring to the information world and the other to the physical world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;To me, then, privacy is really the extension of my own freedom of self</i><br>
<i>&gt;control into the information world.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but to your enemies, what YOU call privacy seems a lot like concealing<br>
from them what they need to know about your nefarious schemes and nasty<br>
conspiracies.   Is it impossible to imagine that you, Hal Finney, as you<br>
get deservedly rich and powerful, might be perceived as part of a power<br>
bloc who someone else worries about?  This RELATIVE aspect of secrecy --<br>
that your "privacy" might be someone elses "unaccountability" is a feature<br>
that is completely different that freedom, where my freedom is enhanced by<br>
increasing your freedom.<br>
<p>
I have pleaded again and again for someone on your side to address the<br>
relativity issue, to no avail.  But let's consider it a moment.<br>
<p>
Of the five dangerous power centers in the world today, government,<br>
aristo-oligarchies, criminals, religions and the techno elite, you ONLY<br>
talk about government!  The tools of secrecy you tout will help the other<br>
four to conspire... and by human nature, they certainly will.  They already<br>
do.<br>
<p>
The fact of the matter is that there is all the world's difference between<br>
"privacy" and "freedom", even under your definition.  If I have freedom,<br>
under your definition, I can say what I wish, argue among my fellow<br>
citizens, live my life and try to persuade my fellow citizens that we<br>
should vote ourselves more (or less) privacy.  On the other hand, if I have<br>
privacy but no freedom, I have nothing.  I am a slave.  And privacy<br>
vanishes.<br>
<p>
Again, privacy is a BENEFIT of freedom.<br>
<p>
The fact of the matter is that most free people don't give a $#^&amp;$ what<br>
others know about them, as long as they can confidently see what's going<br>
on.  That is really SEE.<br>
<p>
(Ooh! wouldn't it be awful if your neighbors knew how much you pay in<br>
property taxes?  Or the size of your mortgage?  The world would end!  The<br>
sky would fall!.... Uh... oh, yeah... they already can.  Uh, well, never<br>
mind....)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Heading towards David's challenge, then, in fact I would be surprised if</i><br>
<i>&gt;David did not agree that historically, increased freedom and increased</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy have generally gone hand in hand.  This is actually a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural phenomenon and can be easily understood.  In a history where</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is a constant struggle by one group for control over another,</i><br>
<i>&gt;often the most (or the only) practical way for someone to escape this</i><br>
<i>&gt;control was avoidance.  They would move away, or adopt a low profile,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"go underground".  They would avoid the soldier, the tax collector,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the census taker.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Aw geez.  (1) again these are vague generalities, Hal. Hypnotic mantras.<br>
(2) I'm not interested in tales about the oppressed in a total tyranny<br>
needing cyphers to scurry like rats through a maze while  emperors feast.<br>
It makes great cyberpunk lit, but it's not relevant to my challenge, which<br>
is asking you to show correlations between true historical increases in<br>
freedom on the one hand, and either secrecy or transparency on the other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the aggregate, though, I think the</i><br>
<i>&gt;increased privacy and corresponding increased freedom which people</i><br>
<i>&gt;achieved in this way was nevertheless very significant.</i><br>
<p>
Wha?  I think?  When?  Where?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Keep in mind, too, that by its nature, privacy enhancement tends not</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make it into the history books!  A person who successfully achieves</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy will not be a prominent public figure, he will be an "invisible</i><br>
<i>&gt;man", someone who does not come to the attention of either the authorities</i><br>
<i>&gt;or the historians.)</i><br>
<p>
Civilization is not made by nihilists.  I will defend their right to say<br>
F.you to society.  I will not defend their right to be Ted Kazinskis and<br>
hide behind masks of anonymity while mailing bombs at what they idiotically<br>
believe to be a tyranny.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Burmese freedom fighters and other resistance groups around the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;giving thanks for the availability of privacy protecting technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which they say has saved many lives.</i><br>
<p>
If tyranny comes, it will be because we failed to keep the mighty<br>
accountable.  In that case, I'll certainly join the cypherpunks and use all<br>
the secret techniques I can to fight. (I always said I was a moderate on<br>
this issue.  I just seem extreme because the "center" in this "debate" is<br>
out on the weird fringes.)  Anyway, we'll fight.  But can you name such a<br>
resistance that ever actually worked, without outside help?  (I can name<br>
one, but can you?)<br>
<p>
Okay. Bigh Brother's here. We'll fight... until they decide they've had<br>
enough with our PGP and underground web sites, and they knock the doors<br>
down and kill us all and our families.  So much for cypher tech.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The best example I can give to directly address David's point, a case</i><br>
<i>&gt;where I would argue that increased privacy provided the forces and</i><br>
<i>&gt;motivations for a significant increase in freedom, is the American</i><br>
<i>&gt;revolution.</i><br>
<p>
Must I say it again?  Privacy, being a benefit of freedom, will certainly<br>
rise to some extent after a tyranny is shaken off.  But the American<br>
Revolution is the ultimate paramount example of MY correlation!   It was a<br>
revolution about accountability.  About setting up the world's first system<br>
in which the mighty were effectively exposed to light and prevented from<br>
conspiring against the masses.<br>
<p>
The sad thing about this is that I have been willing and ready all along to<br>
discuss varied aspects and levels of privacy, ranging from my "benefit"<br>
version to Strong Privacy all the way to Randite secrecy fetishism.  I've<br>
looked at it from all angles with you guys.  But not once has Hal or his<br>
rude friend made even the slightest effort to address my concern about<br>
accountability, either to demonstrate that it is less important than their<br>
conception of privacy, or to show that government is the only power center<br>
that needs it, or to consider how it might involve a tradeoff with the<br>
personal secrecy they extoll, or to show that we can apply accountability<br>
to ALL dangerous power centers in an environment in hich secrecy is a<br>
paramount virtue.<br>
<p>
They comment not at all about how the privacy tools they would give the<br>
common man will certainly be used (to greater effectiveness) by cliques of<br>
the mighty.<br>
<p>
Now why is that?<br>
<p>
Again, I care not a whit about arm-waving hypnotic phrases.  The challenge<br>
stands.  You are making a grand prescription for howto cure a sick society.<br>
Well, then show us examples that the prescription has worked in even one<br>
patient before this.<br>
<p>
David Brin<br>
<p>
<p>
PS....  Hal, you and Robin understand that I'm flamboyant and noisy.  But I<br>
like you guys and would never holler this way at folks whose brains I<br>
didn't dig.  I don't have the life span to waste any on fools.<br>
