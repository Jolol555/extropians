ALex in a post I mostly agreed with and enjoyed wrote:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;"how" is the domain of technology---</i><br>
<i>          &gt;"useful" belongs to the domain of econonics ---</i><br>
<i>&gt;"enjoyable" is art and is counted by the human internal </i><br>
<i>          &gt;emotional machinery.</i><br>
          <br>
That statement may be one take, yet not complete. Art<br>
is of course, one of the ways to get *in* to a person <br>
through their emotional response. (This may be the "how")<br>
Music is an obvious example of this. I have seen<br>
otherwise dry eyed people cry at a beautiful song.<br>
Art is not defined by how much one enjoys it. <br>
Art is often confused with beauty,  but art can be<br>
many more things than pleasureable or beautiful.<br>
In fact many po-mo 'artiste's' eschew that aesthetic.<br>
I try to fuse as much beauty into my art as possible,<br>
but still get my mesage across, but often art does<br>
not *function* as enjoyable in terms of domain.<br>
Sometimes it is highly intellectual.  It can be educational <br>
and political. It can piss people off.<br>
(This may be the "use" )<br>
 One function it can have is to "prepare" people's psyche <br>
for what is to come, or for things they have a hard <br>
time accepting (like transhumanism, for example). <br>
