<i> &gt; Hrmmph!!!  Since when has the scientific method been able to say anything</i><br>
<i> &gt; about "ownership"?  By all means let's discuss ownership, but please leave</i><br>
<i> &gt; science out of it.  It's not within its scope.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: By "scientific" I imply tangible physical measurement, <br>
or "materialist," as in "the materialist measure of ownership<br>
versus the imaginary measure of ownership."<br>
<p>
To that effect: to manipulate physical matter is control <br>
physical matter, and to control it is to own it.  <br>
<p>
There may then be a theoretical system of "ethical" rules that <br>
govern the allocation of physical properties among various actors.<br>
It's that system that we agree is but a phantasm.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; The Earth owns us all, the galaxy </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; owns the Earth, and the Universe the galaxy.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; No it doesn't.  The great power-being Polkadot The Meaningful owns</i><br>
<i> &gt; everything.  So there!  :-)</i><br>
<p>
IAN: So your saying that the physical fact that the Earth experts <br>
gravitational control over you, and thus, where control = ownership, <br>
the Earth therefore owns you, is equivalent to "Polkadot The Meaningful" ?? <br>
Have I made some reference to features external to physical reality ?<br>
There seems an equivalence of fantasy and physical reality in your <br>
thinking, unless we're just talking past one another.<br>
<p>
The distinction that seems to be missing in your counter is,<br>
<p>
specifically, that we can verify that you can manipulate physical matter, <br>
yet we cannot verify the existence of any "Polkadot the Meaningful."<br>
Ergo, the former "ownership" criterion is consistent with physical fact,<br>
while the latter, "Polkadot God," is inconsistent with physical fact.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; "Ownership" is meaningless except as an accommodation</i><br>
<i> &gt; between people.  If you were my slave then I would "own" your body</i><br>
<i> &gt; despite the control you have over it.  There really isn't any future in</i><br>
<i> &gt; reasoned argument about intrinsic rights of ownership, because the whole</i><br>
<i> &gt; area is founded on a figment without substance outside of human society.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I suggest that physical matter exists, and its manipulation <br>
is the only logical measure of "control," and thus of "ownership," <br>
where " to control = to own. "<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Yes, it's a useful concept in society today, like God was for thousands</i><br>
<i> &gt; of years.  However, there is only partial intersection between the sets</i><br>
<i> &gt; of what is useful and of what has substance in the universe.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: Rights are imaginations. The manipulation of physical matter<br>
by a volitional being is a physical measurement of a rights claim,<br>
and rights are measurable to no degree in excess of this physical<br>
criterion.  That's what I refer to as "scientific" measure, but <br>
perhaps more appropriately it should be defined as a "materialist" <br>
criterion for the measurement of a rights claim.<br>
<p>
There is no "right" greater than the right you claim, and <br>
your right is no more "real" than your ability to enforce it, <br>
no more "real" than your ability to manipulate physical matter.<br>
<p>
That's primary savagery: if X can tackle an kill Y, then X <br>
owns Y.  It is *then* that a theoretical system of ethics may <br>
be conceived that will dictate what is the "just" enforcement <br>
of rights claims. And some theoretical systems will produce <br>
different outcomes than others,  and we choose the best<br>
system of ethics based its proven physical performance.<br>
I choose those systems that maximize individual liberty.<br>
