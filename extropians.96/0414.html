I would be exceptionally surprised if people who were _already_ opposed to<br>
one's ideas, ethics, morality, socio-economic theories, etc. would, having<br>
been insulted, become more responsive to, and accepting of, one's position.<br>
How does this break their memetic defenses effectively? Any new memes which<br>
of which they may become aware will forever be associated with deprecation<br>
and insult: they are hardly likely to sally forth spreading the good word of<br>
Extropianism, or any other meme system. And any further discussion will<br>
require an overcoming of exacerbated ill-feeling and distrust.<br>
<p>
I suspect that David Musick's experiences with his father are the exception,<br>
rather than the rule. He is in the fortunate position of having a mind which<br>
can accept the viewpoint of another as plausibly valid, even when in<br>
opposition to that view, and hence be persuaded to change his own position,<br>
once engaged in the deep thought originating from a debacle with, say, his<br>
father. But I believe that far more often, insult serves only to entrench<br>
opposing viewpoints, and to close the minds of the insulted to further<br>
discussion.<br>
