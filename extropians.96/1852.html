        It is great to see such great art manifested on this list!  Here's<br>
one of my own called "The Automorph".  It's along the same lines as<br>
Natasha's wonderful post.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
THE AUTOMORPH<br>
<p>
<p>
He lives just to live<br>
He doesn't care 'bout the pain<br>
He tends not to give<br>
Customary refrain<br>
He tries hard to think<br>
To keep from wondering aloud<br>
He's the only link<br>
To the unseen and the avowed<br>
<p>
He is the automorph<br>
<p>
His purposes are plenty<br>
And his meanings profound<br>
His world is never empty<br>
And his heart cannot be bound<br>
He'll do things his own way<br>
Why should he be stopped?<br>
He'll say what he wants to say<br>
Conveys beliefs he'll adopt<br>
<p>
He is the automorph<br>
<p>
He'll move away from the norm<br>
He'll strive to reach a goal<br>
He'll deviate from the swarm<br>
Before harmony takes its toll<br>
He knows that change is always good<br>
He knows it's here to stay<br>
It is his sole livelihood<br>
To help it along its way<br>
<p>
He is the automorph<br>

        Now I just have one question: can an AI create art?  Let's ask John<br>
K Clark, probably the most fascinating *individual* I have ever seen.<br>
<p>
                                        <br>
                                        Ingredi Externus!<br>
