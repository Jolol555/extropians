<i>&gt;An interesting read is Michael Hutichinson's "The Anatomy of Sex and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Power". A point made there is that the investment in offspring for women</i><br>
<i>&gt;is much greater than that for men. A woman has to protect the children</i><br>
<i>&gt;until they reach reproductive age. When dealing with danger and</i><br>
<i>&gt;confrontation it is a bad strategy for a woman to actually become</i><br>
<i>&gt;exposed directly to danger for if the woman dies, so do the children. So</i><br>
<i>&gt;the female strategy is to have others, (men) actually confront the</i><br>
<i>&gt;dangers, for if the men die, the children will survive along with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;female. This script is deeply embedded in our customs and laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here are two examples of this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. All services involving protection and enforcement are almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;exclusively male. Examples are police, firemen and soldiers. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;extends to other physically hazardous jobs, such as logging, heavy</i><br>
<i>&gt;construction, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Every couple of years the politicans start another campaign to hunt</i><br>
<i>&gt;down the "deadbeat dads". I have yet to hear of a campaign to do the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same to "deadbeat moms".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Musing: Since most Extropians are men, does this imply that being</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian is hazardous??</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
One possible reason is that Extropians tend to be technophiles and science<br>
enthusiasts.  In industry, women are conspicuously few in "high technology"<br>
engineering and physical science fields.  Whether this be from societal or<br>
evolutionary design is not important, but it may impact the ratio of men to<br>
women who are attracted to extropianism.<br>
<p>
As a generalization, I would say that a significant percentage of extropians<br>
have a strong affinity for bleeding edge technologies.  This is not<br>
suprising seeing as how the school of thought for Extropianism includes many<br>
bleeding edge science and technology themes.  The general lack or exclusion<br>
of women in science and technology fields may somehow be subconsciously<br>
excluding them from extropianism as well.<br>
<p>
Just a thought.<br>
