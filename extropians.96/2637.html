<p>
That's the beauty of a really FREE market - It automatically weeds <br>
out the badies.  A person with strong racist feelings would simply not <br>
_be_ one of the richest people in the world, because the majority of <br>
people don't support this idea.  <br>

<i>&gt; Not everyone with $$ have brains.</i><br>
<p>
Everyone with $$ has the right combination of brains, courage and <br>
pragmatism, otherwise they wouldn't have that much money.<br>
<p>
I don't support the idea of having a free market on the one hand and <br>
politics on the other, where the winner in the money game gets to be <br>
the winner in the politics game.  It makes more sense to me to only <br>
have the free market as law maker.<br>
