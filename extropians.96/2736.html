<p>
Because we have evolved to be such flexible organisms, I think we <br>
have a better chance of surviving a wider range of catastrophes (sp?) <br>
than do the HTPs.<br>
<p>
I see survival as our only goal in this universe.  For the first time <br>
in the known history of evolution we don't have to worry so much <br>
about solving our short term survival problems like guessing where <br>
the next meal is coming from.  We now have the opportunity to start <br>
solving our problems of 100 years from now.<br>
<p>
But the sole drive behind all our activity is still survival.<br>
