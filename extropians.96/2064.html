  At 09:08 PM 9/23/96 +0100, Sarah Marr questioned:<br>
<i>  &gt;</i><br>
<i>  &gt; I'm not aware of any [ conspiracy theories ] which </i><br>
<i>  &gt; have... been proven correct. So a question for Ian...</i><br>
<i>  &gt;</i><br>
<i>  &gt; Can you give examples of conspiracy theories which have turned out true?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
 IAN: If we define "proven true" as "that which is accepted <br>
 by the GovtMedia," and thus by the majority of people, I'd <br>
 be hard-pressed to point to a conspiracy "proven true."  <br>
<p>
 If we define "proven true" as "consistent with facts," then <br>
 there are many conspiracy theories proven true, such as:<br>
<p>
<p>
    CONSPIRACY THEORY 1: Attica prison guards killed all the<br>
    prisoners and hostages during the 1971 Attica prison riot. <br>
<p>
 FACT: The GovtMedia reported that the prisoners cut the hostages <br>
 throats. Headlines even said "I Saw The Slit Thoughts." Recently, 25 <br>
 years later, the man who did the autopsies, Dr. Baden, said on the HBO <br>
 series "Autopsy" that the guards shot everyone and the stories to the <br>
 contrary were a Big Lie. Yet the media line is still the govt line. It <br>
 becomes clear after a little research that the media serves the State.<br>
<p>
<p>
    CONSPIRACY THEORY 2: Many people who died during the <br>
    final assault on the  Branch Davidian community  in<br>
    Waco, TX, were killed by the FBI, not at the hands <br>
    of Davidian members as reported. The GovtMedia con-<br>
    spires to cover-up and censor facts proving this.<br>
<p>
 FACT 1: In November of '93, pathologist Dr. Rodney Crowe, who did <br>
 autopsies on surviving bodies from the Waco fire, said on the Murry <br>
 Povich Show that the children who died of blunt-force trauma were in <br>
 fact * crushed to death after a tank collapsed a concrete wall on them. *<br>
 The children and their mothers --  over 40 women and children  -- were <br>
 this concrete room  (which GovtMedia called "the bunker" )  trying to <br>
 survive, not to kill themselves as the GovtMedia would have us think.<br>
 They were all killed. The GovtMedia told us that these children were <br>
 "beaten to death by their parent in the final moments."  Dr. Crowe <br>
 was irate about this gross example of GovtMedia disinformation. <br>
<p>
 FACT 2: Medical examiner Nizaam Peerwani testified at the Davidian's <br>
 trial that three women and six children in that concrete room died of <br>
 suffocation *before* the fire. He suspects it was due to CS gas (Trial <br>
 transcripts: 5979, 6029). Did you hear about that on the news? Nope. Ms.<br>
 Reno said she does not think CS can be lethal to children, yet the label <br>
 on all CS canisters says that CS used indoors can be fatal to children.  <br>
 Before the fire, a tank shot several  * exploding *  CS rounds point-<br>
 blank into that small room filled with women and children. Mt Carmel <br>
 was heavily bugged, so they had to know where the women and children <br>
 were. Notice how these *facts* are censored from any news coverage. <br>
 That is itself proof of conspiracy to cover-up mass murder. More:<br>
<p>
 FACT 3: According to former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, infra-red <br>
 (FLIR) video taken from the FBI's own helicopter proves that the FBI fired<br>
 heavily with full-auto machine guns into the Mt Carmel center just as the <br>
 fire started, which was when people would most likely try to exit. The FLIR <br>
 video also proves that Davidians did NOT fire out at the tanks on that day <br>
 as reported by the GovtMedia. That bit of disinformation was a key pretext <br>
 to speeding up the demolition of the building. Ramsey Clark will be using <br>
 this FLIR video in upcoming wrongful death suits against the so-called<br>
 "Department of Justice."  Ramsey Clark spoke about the FLIR video at <br>
 the April 19, 1996 memorial gathering in Waco, TX.<br>
<p>
 FACT 4: Toxicologist Dr. William Marcus, testified at the congressional<br>
 hearings on Waco that the CS molecule contains a "cyanide radical" that<br>
 could have been transdermally absorbed by the children due to their thin <br>
 skin. CS also converts to hydrogen cyanide upon heating. In fact, surviving<br>
 bodies where found to contain very high levels of cyanide. Dr. Marcus also<br>
 observed that CS is a heavy particle that is suspended in the air like a <br>
 gas only for a brief period when carried by the flammable and toxic agent <br>
 methyl chloride, thus CS particles fall quickly to the ground.  The FBI<br>
 calculated that if spread evenly over the known sq. feet of indoor space, <br>
 the tons of CS pumped in should not have exceeded safe levels. But this <br>
 is a deception because, as CS quickly falls, very high concentrations <br>
 would be found toward the floor along with the children and fallen <br>
 adults, in fact, 10 to 100x higher than if uniformly distributed.<br>
<p>
 I believe that these facts prove the conspiracy theory that the govt <br>
 killed many or most of the people who died on April 19, 1993 at Waco, <br>
 Waco, TX.  The facts also strongly suggest, to as the least, that the <br>
 govt killed with intent.  They also prove that the media censors all <br>
 those facts that indicate govt culpability in favor of false claims <br>
 that demonize the victims of govt abuse, thereby rendering the media <br>
 a willing accessory to mass murder and to the obstruction of justice.<br>
<p>
<p>
    CONSPIRACY THEORY 3: The FBI facilitated and allowed the World <br>
    Trade Center bombing to happen when they could have stopped it.<br>
<p>
 FACTS: As reported by The New York Times (10/28/93) and CNN, Mr. <br>
 Salem, a 43-year-old former Egyptian Army officer, was used by the <br>
 FBI to infiltrate the terrorists later charged in the Trade Center <br>
 bombing.  The original plan told to  Mr. Salem was that his job was <br>
 to see to it that fake explosives were used, then the bombers would <br>
 be busted for planting what they thought was a real bomb with no <br>
 possibility of anybody getting hurt. A good plan.  Mr. Salem <br>
 secretly tape-recorded hundreds of hours of his telephonic <br>
 communications with authorities without their knowledge.<br>
<p>
 The recordings reveal that the FBI changed the original plan and <br>
 told Mr. Salem  NOT  to use the fake explosives but to use  REAL  <br>
 explosives. The FBI agent who told him to use real explosives was <br>
 adamant about this. I saw and heard this on CNN in '93 and could not <br>
 believe my eyes and ears, I thought, "We'll never hear the end of <br>
 this." Boy was I wrong, it totally disappeared. Alas, there is a <br>
 excerpt of some of this that was printed in The New York <br>
 Times available at:   <br>
<p>
           <a href="http://www.netwrk2000.com/okbomnws.html">http://www.netwrk2000.com/okbomnws.html</a><br>
<p>
 While these recordings were played in preliminary court hearings, <br>
 they were barred from the actual trial because Mr. Salem made them<br>
 without the permission of the FBI agents. The govt can bug you without <br>
 your permission,  but the opposite is not also true -- that's tyranny. <br>
 The tapes exist, and they prove that the FBI de facto orchestrated the <br>
 bombing of the World Trade Center, an act that would result in massive <br>
 new police powers for the FBI. However, because the tapes were barred <br>
 from court, the media simply pretends they don't exist and the truth <br>
 is forever nullified from the official GovtMedia story, exiled to <br>
 the dark allies of seedy conspiracy theory. <br>
<p>
 They say that tens of thousands would have died if the truck-bomb <br>
 had been able to park in the spot the bombers had reserved, right <br>
 next to a key column, but when they got there a car had taken their <br>
 spot. I'd like to think someone knew about this and parked the car <br>
 there to saves the lives of thousands of people. <br>
<p>
<p>
    CONSPIRACY THEORY 4: The FBI fabricated <br>
    evidence in the Oklahoma bombing investigation.<br>
<p>
 FACT: Associated Press 04/10/96 reports that (emphasis added):<br>
<p>
        Prosecutors agreed to turn over letters from FBI <br>
        agent Frederic Whitehurts, who tested Mr. McVeigh's <br>
        cloths for traces of explosives. Mr. Whitehurst has <br>
        claimed that investigators FAKED evidence in the <br>
        bombing case.              ^^^^^ <br>
<p>
<p>
   CONSPIRACY THEORY 5: The Govt was both involved in the OK <br>
   bombing and had foreknowledge and is covering this up.<br>
<p>
 FACT 1: Former Grand Juror Hoppy Heidelberg, in charge of evidence in the<br>
 Oklahoma City bombing case, told the press that, "No one who saw McVeigh <br>
 with other suspects [ such as John Doe #2 ], was ever allowed to testify <br>
 before the Federal Grand Jury." Mr. Heidelberg was eventually thrown off <br>
 the jury after he refused to stop asking questions about John Doe 2. <br>
 His review of the best available evidence lead him to conclude, as <br>
 actually reported in both the USA Today (10/19/95) and the AP: <br>
<p>
        "I think they [the govt] know who John Doe 2 is, <br>
        and they are protecting him. This is because John <br>
        Doe 2 was either a government agent or a government<br>
        informant. Either way they [the govt] had... prior <br>
        knowledge to the bombing and that's what they <br>
        can't afford to come out."<br>
<p>
 FACT 2: The Portland newspaper the OREGONIAN (4/20/95), states that <br>
 Judge Wayne Alley, whose office sits across from the Murrah building, <br>
 was warned several days prior to the blast by "security specialists"<br>
 to take "special precautions." This story never resurfaced. <br>
<p>
 FACT 3: The USA Today (4/20/95) reported that Harvy Weathers, of the <br>
 Oklahoma City Fire Department, said that the fire dept. had received <br>
 a call from the FBI prior to the bombing stating that there would be <br>
 "some people entering the city over the weekend." Weathers did not <br>
 explain what this meant, but obviously an army of FBI were to enter <br>
 the city after the bombing later the next week. "Over the weekend" <br>
 would have been a few days before the bombing.<br>
<p>
 FACT 4: Oklahoma State Representative Charles Key says that he knows <br>
 of two witnesses who overheard ATF employees state that they were warned <br>
 not to come to work that day, indeed only one agent did show up for work<br>
 that day. Representative Key also points out that bomb squad employees <br>
 were seen in front of the building at 7:15 am, about two hours prior to <br>
 the blast. Rep. Key has conducted his own investigation and was so shocked <br>
 with the evidence he uncovered, he compiled it into a video presentation, <br>
 which you can find at a site that also promotes the bible: <br>

<p>
 FACT 5: As reported by the Associated Press, the McVeigh defense <br>
 team is in possession of tapes of a call made by the FBI to Oklahoma <br>
 City officials warning of a possible terrorist event in the next few <br>
 days made several days prior to the blast. <br>
<p>
 FACT 6: As reported widely on CNN and TV stations across the nation, <br>
 up to four primed bombs were found and defused inside what remained of <br>
 the Murrah Center Federal Building on April 19, 1995. I have much of <br>
 this on tape. How could they have been placed without inside govt <br>
 connections? <br>
<p>
 FACT 7: According to CNN, the bombs were found by bomb sniffing dogs.<br>
 The ATF later said they were dummy bombs used for bomb training in the<br>
 busy downtown office building. If so, containing no explosives, then<br>
 explosives detecting dogs would not had tracked them down as they did, <br>
 nor would munitions technicians have spent so much time defusing them <br>
 as they did, for, practice bombs are always clearly labeled as such. <br>
<p>
 FACT 8: KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City reported on the 19th that two or more <br>
 of the bombs found inside were "far larger in magnitude than the fist <br>
 that went off INSIDE the building" (seismic recorders at two locations<br>
 both recorded TWO blasts). A terrorist expert, Dr. Randall Heather, on <br>
 KFOR-TV said, "We have both of the bombs that were defused at the site <br>
 and they are being taken apart." The news coverage went on to say that <br>
 another bomb was found strapped to a column next to the day care center. <br>
 Up to four unexploded bombs where found inside by the end of the day.<br>
<p>
 FACT 9: Brigadier General Partin (USAF, Air Force Armament Technology<br>
 Laboratory, ret.), one of the top munitions experts in the world, says <br>
 that blast damage patterns are NOT consistent with an ANFO truck bomb. <br>
 He says that demolition charges had to be placed on the columns, and <br>
 sure enough, one was found attached to a column that failed to go off. <br>
 Important excerpts of Partin's report along with many photographs<br>
 may be found at (very large page, select no graphics for speed):<br>

<p>
 FACT 10: According to the publication Veritas (5/9/95), bomb technicians <br>
 inside the building on the 19th who were finding the unexploded bombs <br>
 inside were heard to say police radio: <br>
<p>
        First voice:  Boy your not going to believe this!<br>
        Second voice: Believe what?<br>
        First voice:  I can't believe it... this is a military bomb!<br>

<p>
 The above listing of facts is but a drop in the bucket of all facts <br>
 that support and/or prove conspiracy on the part of the govt in only <br>
 the few cases cited above. Needless to say there are many other cases <br>
 with significant evidence to suggest govt conspiracy, such as the <br>
 assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and civil rights leader <br>
 Martin Luther King, the Jonestown atrocity, the running of drugs,...  <br>
<p>
 A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the facts, who<br>
 refuse to believe that their govt and their media will routinely lie to<br>
 them and fabricate a reality contrary to verifiable facts,  is a society<br>
 that chooses and deserves the Police State Dictatorship it's going to get. <br>
