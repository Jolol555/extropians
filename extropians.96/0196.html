I admit that wormholes are iffy, but given wormholes, I don't think<br>
most places could stay very isolated.  They'd have to destroy *all*<br>
holes to their region, and then these holes could be rebuilt again<br>
very quickly from the "upwind" direction (from where each civilization<br>
began).  Hopes for cultural diversity would have to be based on<br>
something other than isolation.<br>
