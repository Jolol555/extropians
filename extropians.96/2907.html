An experience which changed my perception of beauty was my first time <br>
in a gay bar.  My usual programmed hetero-male instincts orient me to <br>
a 'predator' type behaviour in normal social situations.  All of a <br>
sudden this was swung around and I became both predator and prey.<br>
<p>
Most men are not sexy because they don't really see themselves as the <br>
'prey', therefore they don't need to look beautiful.  If you earn <br>
enough money, you're automatically entitled <br>
to a beer belly and cheap cologne, without jeopordising your mating <br>
chances too much.  This is also mostly the female's fault for having <br>
the 'I can't funciton on my own and need someone to protect me' <br>
meme.<br>
<p>
I find both sexes to be beautiful, our only criteria for judging a <br>
potential mate is no longer child bearing <br>
ability, rather we find people attractive who would contribute to our <br>
growth.  Unfortuanately we have a lot of programmed baggage telling <br>
what is and what isn't sexy.<br>
