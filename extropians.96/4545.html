<p>
SImple: Jupiter is not dense enough. To stellate it you'de have to use<br>
the Von Neumann machine trick Clarke thought up for 2010, to increase<br>
the density of jupiters core enough to collapse and heat up enough<br>
hydrogen for a sustained reaction. After that, you're ratio of hydrogen<br>
to heavier elements (the ones you needed to make it dense enough in the<br>
first place) would make Jupiter age quickly, probably with a life of not<br>
more than 10,000 to maybe as much as 1 million years.<br>

<i>&gt; Since we are at madcap ideas, again: I've been reading up on some</i><br>
<i>&gt; preliminary prospection, erm, cosmochemistry. What is the legal</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation: which country/person owns the Moon? </i><br>
<p>
The UN Space Treaty declared the Moon to belong to all nations equally.<br>
The US refuses to sign this treaty for this reason (as we are the only<br>
ones who actually got there). Since nobody is there now, and based on<br>
past international law regarding colonization as well as the UN Charter,<br>
a nation with the ability to send and support, as well as survive the<br>
ire of the world body, could theoretically colonise and claim the moon,<br>
just as a corporation could also do so, so long as they declared their<br>
colony an independent nation, and were able to wangle a UN member state<br>
to recognise them and sponsor their admission to the UN.<br>
<p>
WHy a nation would do this is obvious. Not only the value of having the<br>
highest strategic position on anyone militarily, but the mineral<br>
resources, plus the quantity of helium III embedded in the lunar<br>
regolith is estimated to be woth trillions easily if it is as useful for<br>
practical fusion power as thought.<br>
<p>
<p>
Phobos? Is this a claim<br>
<i>&gt; thing, first comes first, or is it currently legally undefined? I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; assume the latter. As you doubtlessly know, unmanned LEO launch capacity</i><br>
<i>&gt; will soon grew progressively cheaper and cheaper, currently there are (tiny)</i><br>
<i>&gt; amateur satellites up there. </i><br>
<p>
Anything unmanned can have no hopes of making claims.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's your oppinion, when will the general public realize that all above</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not just another fraudulent scheme, and would invest in such a company?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Current public opinion is that the moon is a dud (they are wrong of<br>
course) and that the new hearts content is Mars, with its possible life<br>
forms (a stupid reason to go, but good enough as any if it actually gets<br>
people up there to do something constructive).<br>
<p>
I actually fancy the idea of founding a new nation on the moon. of<br>
course, it'll have to be Luna, and the motto will be TANSTAAFL!<br>
