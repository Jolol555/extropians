I agree with your first two sentences, but the rest of the conclusions<br>
you draw from it only obtain if you assume a value-tree that is<br>
static over time. To the extent that being "high" in the value tree<br>
means actually exercising a lot of motivating force in determining<br>
one's actions, then sometimes (particularly when one's life is<br>
directly threatened) the fundamental value of being alive is going<br>
to have a lot of motivating "force", and at other times it's going<br>
to be a merely incidental background process. I think Minsky has<br>
said somewhere that there is no such thing as "survival drive".<br>
Perhaps there is no such thing naturally, but I suspect such things<br>
can be developed, and perhaps it would be a good idea.<br>
<p>
I also suspect that human cognition is far too plastic for us to<br>
be able to discuss these things as if they were givens. That's<br>
something that economists pretty much have to do (accept human<br>
values as data) according to the traditions of their discipline,<br>
but I like to think that we can do more than merely economic analysis<br>
of ourselves.<br>
<p>
Whether our values are linearly comparable or not, to the extent<br>
that we can only do one thing at a time with our bodies, we hack<br>
out some internal linear measure anyway... that's how we decide<br>
what to do with our bodies at any given moment. This hacked-out<br>
scalar approximation of "value" clearly changes from moment to<br>
moment and differs from individual to individual; it may or may<br>
not be derived from a more stable "deeper structure" which might<br>
be modeled by some more complex data structure than a priority<br>
queue. Furthermore, this hypothetical deeper structure may or may<br>
not have perceivable elements that are "objective": products of<br>
evolution that form a reliable (in the sense, I suppose, of living<br>
a satisfying life and attaining reproductive success on both the<br>
genetic and memetic levels???) "basis" for human values. But as<br>
far as I'm concerned, all of this is merely metaphor, because none<br>
of this is at the stage of measurement or prediction yet. It's not<br>
even particularly precise.<br>
<p>
As usual when discussing such things, I think it's important that<br>
we not confuse our models of our values with our values themselves.<br>
Our values are mysterious beasties in our brain somewhere; from a<br>
different perspective, we could say our values are ourselves. There<br>
are many possible perspectives on this stuff. But our theories<br>
about values, our value-maps, our models are not the values<br>
themselves. It has been my experience that forgetting this part<br>
can lead to states that are too close to insanity for my taste,<br>
which is why I like to bring it up whenever talking about this<br>
stuff. Driving people insane is not (quite) my intention.<br>
