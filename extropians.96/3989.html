<i>&gt;I was also thinking about the idea of farming humans to eat.  Humans </i><br>
are <br>
<i>&gt;expensive to feed, and they take several years to mature, but if </i><br>
someone <br>
<i>&gt;really enjoyed human meat, is there anything wrong with farming them?  </i><br>
<p>
    I've given the use of humans as animals some thought before. I've <br>
come to the conclusion that it would be a bad idea because:<br>
<p>
1) There are no guranties that I would not be kidnapped, lobotomized or <br>
otherwised brainwashed, and thrown into the human farm or work station <br>
or whatever.  <br>
<p>
2) It creates an immovable ruling class.<br>
<p>
    During slavery in this country it was not uncommon for free blacks <br>
to be captured and sold into slavery.  They could protest but no one <br>
would believe them.  I could be taken off the street and lobotomized.  <br>
I would not even be able to protest, much less be believed. <br>
<p>
    By delegating a part of humanity to farming or slavery we remove <br>
them from the intellectual mainstream. A potential scientific genius <br>
could be born and never contribute to the word in any way except <br>
through his meat or his labor.  This is part of the reason why I think <br>
decent education for everyone is the way to maximize progress.<br>
<p>
    I'd be happy to expand on these ideas at a later date.  I'll admit <br>
now that if my arguements don't sound great its because I haven't <br>
thought that much about it. Only through discussion will we find what <br>
is closest to the truth. <br>
<p>
