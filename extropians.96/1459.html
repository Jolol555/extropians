   Thanks for the summary, Robin. It's close, but not perfect, at least<br>
for me.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that Dan Clemmensen, Rich Artym, and John Clark, are making</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same argument here.  Let me summarize their "NanoDream", as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand it:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At some point there will be a device which</i><br>
<i>&gt; [A]can disassemble generic stuff in the environment into feedstock,</i><br>
<i>&gt; [B]scan any (house-or-smaller-sized) object for its atomic-level design,</i><br>
<i>&gt; [C]sythesize a plan for constructing such an object from feedstock,</i><br>
<i>&gt; [D]retool itself and construct the object with a low error rate, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; [E]repair itself, or break slowly enough to replace itself anew often.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[B] and [C} aren't necessary. I'll accept public-comain de novo MNT<br>
designs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If such a device were smaller than a house, and could replace itself</i><br>
<i>&gt; in less than a year using stuff available from an acre of land, and if</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyright on the design were not strictly enforced, but if property</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights to such acres of land were strictly and cheaply enforced, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; it would seem that within a hundred self-copy times, most everyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; owned an acre of land should have such a device, obtained at the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a small fraction of their acre.  And it seems they could then, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; they chose, soon have an acre full of devices for which the design</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyright was not strictly enforced.  And they might so choose if</i><br>
<i>&gt; public designs were not much worse than private designs, and if local</i><br>
<i>&gt; production were near as efficient as distant specialized production.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Given all this, some folks seem to want to infer that at some point</i><br>
<i>&gt; most living humans will fit the scenario of living off their own small</i><br>
<i>&gt; plot of land, using basically free designs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Actually, given all this, anyone who wishes to do so may drop out<br>
of the economy. I don't know what percentage will do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I've understood this right, I can challenge the conclusion by</i><br>
<i>&gt; pointing to all the assumptions that may not hold.  I do no have much</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that eventually such a device will be possible to construct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, by that time many other changes may happen as well.  The sun</i><br>
<i>&gt; may dim due to intervening solar collectors, or the O2 and CO2 may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; stripped from the atmosphere.  An upload or other population explosion</i><br>
<i>&gt; may mean that the ratio of population to acres is far less than one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or wealth may be very unequally distributed, so few can afford an</i><br>
<i>&gt; acre.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Copyright on these many devices may in fact be strictly enforced, by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; combination of self-destruction upon scan attempts and draconian</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishments for violators.  Public domain designs of most sorts may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite inferior to private designs, or generic one-size-fits-all</i><br>
<i>&gt; devices may be rather inferior in efficiency to specialized devices,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even given shipping costs.  Property rights to acres of land may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be cheaply enforced, but require payment of substantial taxes or PPL</i><br>
<i>&gt; fees.  To pay such fees, one may have to devote a substantial fraction</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ones resources to production at an advanced level - public domain</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense system designs may be nowhere near up to the task.  Finally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most people may prefer more to live be closer to other people, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; dense cities, than to have their own isolated plot of gadgets.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now folks may have plausible arguments for each of these issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I'd like to hear them.  But what are the chances that *all* of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these issues go the way of this NanoDream?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
You are correct: these assumptions, and more, must be met for us to<br>
achieve the "NanoDream." I think that it's unlikely, since I believe the<br>
SI-precipitated SIngularity will occur first.<br>
<p>
However, I feel that the idea that the present economy will evolve<br>
without<br>
revolutionary changes into a MNT economy also rests on many assumptions,<br>
and that these are at least as tenuous. I apologize in advance for<br>
not stating them in this post. I'll take a stab at it later.<br>
