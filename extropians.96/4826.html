<i>&gt; Such photos are in existence, and can be accessed in the US Army</i><br>

<p>
I'll ask you again:  Have you been to the archives yourself?  Have you <br>
seen these photos?  If not, what is the basis for this statement?  <br>
I think you're lying, Mike.  I think you are pretending to have evidence <br>
that you don't have.   <br>
<p>
Obviously, if photos of the gassing operation existed, they would have <br>
been published a long time ago.  A lot of people would like to make <br>
revisionism disappear, and publishing such photos would be the easiest <br>
way to do it.  If Michael Shermer had real, direct, explicit evidence, <br>
he wouldn't need to go through all that rigmarole about "convergence <br>
of evidence."    <br>
<p>
I will bet you five thousand dollars that you can't produce, from <br>
the archives or anywhere else, genuine photos of people being killed <br>
in gas chambers at Auschwitz or Birkenau.  Wanna bet?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;: I'll check that out too.  There is of course a remote possibility</i><br>

<i>&gt;: propaganda than with veracity.  Likewise for your social studies</i><br>
<i>&gt;: teacher.  Nevertheless, I will check out all leads.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why would they be in need of propaganda at that point? we had </i><br>
<i>&gt; won the war...  </i><br>
<p>
Your naivete about politics continues to amaze me.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Einstein, a well known pacifist, became the father of the atom bomb,</i><br>
<i>&gt; against his highest principles, rather than sit and allow such horror to</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue. </i><br>
<p>
Einstein sent his letter to Roosevelt in 1939.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Take soil samples, as well as samples of the grout in the concrete in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chambers. </i><br>
<p>
That's been done.  Fred Leuchter went to Auschwitz, Birkenau, and <br>
Majdanek, took samples from the alleged gas chambers, and sent them <br>
to a lab to be tested for traces of toxic gas.  If the results had been <br>
positive, I wouldn't be writing this.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am personally disgusted with people who keep claiming </i><br>
<i>&gt; that the Holocaust never happened. </i><br>
<p>
I agree that lies are nauseating.  The question of *who* is lying  <br>
remains to be determined. <br>
<p>
There are two explanations for the disappearance of European Jewry.  <br>
One is that they were killed in gas chambers.  This is the conventional <br>
view, accepted, apparently, by almost all historians.  The alternative <br>
explanation, put forward by the revisionists, is that they were uprooted <br>
and driven out:  some of them were shot and buried in mass graves, <br>
and many died of disease, starvation, or exposure, but many others, <br>
perhaps the majority, emigrated or were deported, and they ended up <br>
in the Soviet Union, America, or Israel.   <br>
<p>
The two explanations agree on everything else.  They differ only on the <br>
question of gas chambers.  Both sides agree that World War II occurred,  <br>
that concentration camps existed, that a large number of Jews were sent <br>
to the camps and never returned, that a large number (half a million? <br>
or more?) were taken out and shot and buried in mass graves, and that <br>
most of the Jewish people of occupied Europe were uprooted from their <br>
homes and turned into prisoners or refugees.  In other words, the Nazis <br>
practiced "ethnic cleansing" on a continent-wide scale.  All of this is <br>
*not* in dispute here.  The only question is:  Were there gas chambers?  <br>
<p>
Promoters of the conventional view make fun of the revisionists (or <br>
profess themselves to be disgusted).  They try to make it appear that  <br>
the revisionists are denying the obvious, and saying "It didn't happen," <br>
where "It" refers ambiguously to the gas chambers *and* to the whole <br>
phenomenon of deportation of Jews, bodies in mass graves, scenes of <br>
starving prisoners at the end of the war, etc, etc.  As I just pointed out, <br>
the revisionists don't deny all that.  They only deny the gas chambers.  <br>
But their opponents use the argument-by-equivocation shamelessly, and <br>
it's very hard to resist.  <br>
<p>
This equivocation is the key to the whole subject.  <br>
<p>
As with many things in life, you have to keep your eye on the ball.  <br>
As soon as you let yourself get drawn into an argument about whether <br>
"it" happened, all is lost.  The only way to get anywhere with this <br>
investigation is to focus on one well-defined question, preferably a <br>
simple question about physical facts, and stay focused on that question <br>
until it is settled.  The question that suggests itself for this purpose is:  <br>
Were there gas chambers?  There is nothing subjective or nebulous <br>
about this.  It is a straightforward Aristotelian situation:  either there <br>
were gas chambers at Auschwitz, or there were not.  We aren't talking <br>
about Schroedinger's cat.  This is a simple thing.     <br>
