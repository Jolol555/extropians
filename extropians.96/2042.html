You falsely divide the world into "logic" and "emotion."  What about knowledge?<br>
Yes, "with logic alone you can [only] calculate outcomes from premises."<br>
Likewise, with emotion alone you can only react.<br>
<p>
The real question is: where do we get our premises?  You are clearly better<br>
off if your premises come from understanding, not emotion.  The same goes<br>
for values.<br>
<p>
Poor Bertrand Russell.  It is too late for him to disown such a foolish<br>
statement. &lt;g&gt;<br>
