Prozac knocked out practically my entire mind.  It was a very<br>
frightening experience, but only in retrospect.  (In a way that's the<br>
worst part.)  I look at the programming work I did during that time and<br>
it's total trash.  I'm not sure if I've posted this previously, but I<br>
took one Life-simulation program that I wrote on Prozac (over the course<br>
of days), rewrote it over the course of fifteen minutes, and it ran<br>
twice as fast and took a fourth of the time to modify.  This isn't a<br>
boast, it's a lament on how dumbly it was written originally.<br>
<p>
Moral:  DON'T TAKE PROZAC.  That stuff is *evil*.<br>
