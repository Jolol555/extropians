<i>&gt;I just read an article in a Danish newspaper, quoting a British newspaper,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the Japanese are going for the moon BIG TIME. Sometime in the next 100</i><br>
<i>&gt;years they aim to get +50.000 people up there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anybody nows more?</i><br>
<p>
There is more information in the November issue of Science and it seems<br>
they're going to create a probe that orbits the moon and then dispatches<br>
missile-like probes which will impact the surface and burrow in to read<br>
temperature and seismographic data and the probe in orbit will pass over<br>
these probes every 15 days and relay information back to Earth. What would<br>
be great would be if the Japanese went to the moon and removed the US flag<br>
and placed their own in it's spot and then told the US that if they wanted<br>
their flag put back they'd have get off their lazy asses and do it themselves!!<br>
