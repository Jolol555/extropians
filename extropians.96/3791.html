<p>
I disagree.  The timeframe, depending on individual involvement, is<br>
something more around a year.  And the appropriate technologies are<br>
currently available.  Most of these technologies *are* considered bleeding<br>
edge, but that should really be an incentive more than anything.  IF we were<br>
the first people to successfully mature and develop these technologies, it<br>
would not only generate a lot of media coverage, but it could be very<br>
profitable as well.  It would be extremely likely that other companies would<br>
want us to use our techniques and technologies to develop worlds for them.<br>
This is the way things usually work in the Valley, at least.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;my advice would be to form a small architecture team,  2 to 3 people at</i><br>
most, and agree<br>
<i>&gt;on the basic design.   this team would establish the basic archtitecture</i><br>
"rules of the game"<br>
<i>&gt;and probably build the main world.  other themed worlds could be farmed out</i><br>
to individuals<br>
<p>
Agreed.  We would need an Architecture &amp; Standards Team that could<br>
coordinate and standardize the software interfaces and general architecture.<br>
Preferably this team would include people who are thoroughly familiar with<br>
most of the technologies involved.  This would require extensive<br>
documentation as well.  Beside the software/protocol architecture, we would<br>
also need higher level architects to design the actual world.  This should<br>
probably not be the same people who built the software.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;who sign up.  this could be manageable, maybe,  if these rules are in</i><br>
place.  i would think<br>
<i>&gt;they would need to address standards for object persistency, security,</i><br>
model scale, etx.<br>
<i>&gt;i think there would probably need to be some consistent user interface</i><br>
items each world<br>
<i>&gt;would be expected to follow.</i><br>
<p>
The Architecture &amp; Standards team would also require a set of requirements<br>
and specs for the capabilities of this world.  Who will be responsible for<br>
generating the requirements and specs?  Maybe we should start generating a<br>
comprehensive list of what people want to include, and then have the<br>
technology people whittle away at the list until we have a feasible,<br>
extensible set of design specifications.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;as someone who has seen many s/w projects fail or succeed, i would</i><br>
emphatically suggest<br>
<i>&gt;to keep it very, very simple at first.  also, my experiences with web</i><br>
sites, simulations and<br>
<i>&gt;vr has told me that the artistic stuff is the hard part.  we will need lots</i><br>
of help in that area.<br>
<i>&gt;unless you want something that looks like a bunch of s/w weenies did it.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed!  I am good with software, but terrible with graphical stuff.  Since<br>
content will drive this thing, it will be very important to have a large<br>
number of the non-software people working on the design and development of<br>
content.<br>
