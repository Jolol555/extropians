Actually, I still have an open mind about Penrose's (or was it Searle?)<br>
last-ditch attempt to retain the idea of a soul through quantum mechanical<br>
effects in the brain, but I don't think that it could ever be proved or<br>
disproved except by uploading and seeing what happened. I just don't think<br>
that souls are neccesary to explain consciousness. <br>
<p>
If there ever is scientific proof of the existence of souls, then we will<br>
also have a scientific explanation of the mechanism by which these souls<br>
interact with brains. Consequently we'll be able to work out how to build<br>
our computers so that our soul will be able to interact with our uploaded<br>
"brain". This would appear to prevent us from creating duplicates, and may<br>
also prevent backups, but for uploading we'd just have to attach another<br>
black box to the machines. Annoying, but far from hopeless.<br>
