Yes, I have heard of it. I think it was called polymeric water or<br>
something like it. It was discovered in the first half of this century by<br>
soviet scientists who pressured water through blocks of mica or something<br>
similar. The result was a gel-like substance they claimed was a stable<br>
state of water but actually it was most likely some kind of silica gel<br>
that emerged from the mica, a classic example of premature announcement.<br>
I think it was mentioned in Gardener's "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of<br>
Science". <br>
<p>
There are of course some solid forms of water that are stable at room <br>
temperature, but they all require very high pressures to form (i.e. no <br>
spreading). <br>
