I think you are drawing the distinction between personal responsibility and<br>
leadership.  Personal responsibility is about recognizing you have control<br>
over what you do -- you choose your own role models and mentors.<br>
<p>
The problem arises when people confuse personal responsibility with<br>
self-indulgence.<br>
<p>
Today's politicians are care-takers, not leaders in the classic sense.  The<br>
self-indulgent see nothing wrong with redistribution of income -- as long<br>
as *they* are on the receiving end.<br>
<p>
The problem with today's teachers is they have stopped teaching; education<br>
is now "child-centered."  The self-indulgent believe you learn what you<br>
want to learn when you want to learn it.<br>
<p>
The problem with parents is they are told and believe the village will<br>
raise their kids.  The self-indulgent are too busy to tackle this complex<br>
problem.  Let somebody else figure it out.<br>
<p>
Intellectual and moral leadership have become passe in Western culture.<br>
Today's heroes are basketball players.  The self-indulgent are too busy<br>
feeling good to have any time for noble actions or noble thoughts.<br>
<p>
Can we all lead?  Sure, through personal responsibility we can lead<br>
ourselves.  But you have to master that before you can lead others.<br>
<p>
Just think of me as a very pro-technology reactionary. &lt;g&gt;<br>
