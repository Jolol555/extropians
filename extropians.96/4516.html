	What one should look at in this statement is "...for us *as*<br>
biological beings...".  I think that we will most assuredly NOT remain<br>
completely biological.  In your post you talk about AI's and robots<br>
evolving, exploring the universe, replicating, etc...all independantly<br>
from us mere humans.  It may be directed by us, but as you said, they will<br>
replicate, expand, begin to lead their own lives.  But is it really<br>
reasonable to believe that full fledged AI will not be *incorporated* into<br>
*our* very existence?  I'm not speaking about merely using the technology<br>
and treating it as a seperate entity from ourselves, but what about<br>
*integrating* it with our own person, our bodies, our minds.  Yes, we may<br>
indeed send a plethora of intelligent robots to explore and colonize the<br>
universe, but I think it much more likely, when we are finally able to<br>
achieve such abilities as colonization (or rather, when we get off our<br>
asses and actually do it), we will be much more than just humans with<br>
powerful external technology.  We will be man-machine combinations.  The<br>
very intelligent technology that we send to colonize the universe will be<br>
ourselves.  WE will be the intelligent technology.  And as Hara Ra said<br>
regarding the question of finding a reason for living forever, "We need a<br>
reason?".  Desire for life and knowledge is more than enough. <br>
