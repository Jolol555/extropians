In a few months I will be presenting a series of talks at major<br>
ecomomics and political science departments around the country.  It is<br>
my "job talk", where I will try to convince folks to hire me.<br>
<p>
I will present a paper of mine which has a model which explains why<br>
rational regulators would ban products for rational consumers, rather<br>
than to label them.  I explain such behavior as a commitment failure;<br>
both sides would rather commit to no such bans, but once bans are<br>
possible, regulators often choose them in the game-theoretic<br>
equilibrium, since not banning would be taken as an endorsement of<br>
product quality.<br>
<p>
To make this talk and paper shine, I need three things:<br>
<p>
1) A choice of a prototypical product which is banned.  This might be<br>
a drug (eg marijuana), vitamin, financial asset (eg gambles), building<br>
code, etc.  <br>
<p>
2) Good sources explaining in the protaganists own words the best<br>
politically-effective reasons offered for banning this product.  These<br>
reasons should prominently include to keep adults from hurting<br>
themselves, as opposed to reasons of externalities, non-competitive<br>
markets, addictions, children, or signaling games.  Sloppy incoherent<br>
reasoning is not very useful (could be interpreted many ways), nor are<br>
eloquent reasons that can't be plausibly argued to have had much<br>
effect on the actual political process.<br>
<p>
3) For this product, an authoritive source on the U.S. history of when<br>
it was banned and why, preferably also comparing this across the<br>
world.  For this purposes, "authoritive" includes recent, not<br>
obviously partisan, and of high academic pedigree.<br>
<p>
With these three things in hand, I think I can make a real change in<br>
the thinking of economists and political scientists, toward seeing<br>
such product bans as contrary to consumer interest.  And such an<br>
intellectual change could have important political implications one or<br>
two decades from now.  Any help folks could offer would be<br>
appreciated, and acknowledged.  <br>
