I just read Zindell's _The Wild_.  I haven't read anything else by<br>
Zindell, because no bookstore in the area has had anything by him, so my<br>
only previous exposure had been Anders' quotations from _The Broken<br>
God_.<br>
<p>
Thumbnail review: it was interesting.  Certainly a transhuman book, with<br>
issues of identity duplication, computer intelligence, really big<br>
entities which can fake being gods, and so on.  It refired my<br>
imagination in some respects.  In others... the long stretches of<br>
mystical prose-poetry didn't grab me, not to mention the other mystical<br>
elements -- scrying, remembrancing, consciousness directly manipulating<br>
matter.  If one makes a scale with _A Fire Upon the Deep_ at one end,<br>
and _Dune_ at the other, the universe of this book seemed closer to<br>
_Dune_, which annoys me.  Why?<br>
<p>
These days I seem to prefer hard SF or outright fantasy.  Both _Fire_<br>
and _The Wild_ are books which find wonder and magic in extrapolating<br>
known technology, but which are flawed from the 'hard' viewpoint.  But<br>
the flaws serve different purposes.  Zindell's mystical garnishes seem<br>
intended to enhance the magical flavor of the book, but they end up<br>
distracting and cheapening what derives from the harder nanotech/AI<br>
developments.  Vinge's flaw is the Zones.  The key difference (to me) is<br>
that the Zones aren't meant to enhance anything.  They're meant as an<br>
explicit gimmick to allow the existence of normal humans to perceive the<br>
glory of the Powers.  Vinge wrote hard SF with a crutch (neatly folding<br>
the FTL crutch into the same package); Zindell wrote almost hard-SF with<br>
fringe decorations.  But the appeal of hard extrapolations is in<br>
avoiding such fringes...<br>

Redemption, n: Deliverance of sinners from the penalty of their sin,<br>
through their murder of the deity against whom they sinned.  The doctrine<br>
of Redemption is the fundamental mystery of our holy religion, and whoso<br>
believeth in it shall not perish, but have everlasting life in which to<br>
try to understand it.<br>
  -- Ambrose Bierce, _The Devil's Dictionary_<br>
