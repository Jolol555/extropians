<p>
Possibly, but the meme is certainly not a new one. See Marcel Mauss's 'The<br>
Gift' (written early this century) which deals with concepts of exchange<br>
between individuals and cultures as a fundamental of all human activity,<br>
whilst delineating 'commodity' (i.e. the subject of a trade) and 'gift'<br>
(i.e. well, a gift, although reciprocity is a common feature of gift giving:<br>
an interesting fact in itself).<br>
<p>
Subsequent writers have interpreted Mauss's work in a variety of ways. I was<br>
at a seminar by Maurice Bloch a couple of weeks ago where he was dicsussing<br>
his new paper, which reconstructs Mauss's concepts of exchange. Instead of<br>
seeing the fundamental feature as an exchange of physical items, Bloch sees<br>
it as the exchange of the symbolic interpretations which occur during<br>
discourse between individuals: a sort of semantic/semiotic and, quite<br>
possibly, memetic approach to the interaction.<br>
<p>
(As an aside: The whole thing seems to me to be moving towards a description<br>
of social relations as performance, rather than static forms and functions.<br>
This seems valid, especially when one integrates this line of thought with<br>
current thoughts on sexuality and gender as performance.)<br>
