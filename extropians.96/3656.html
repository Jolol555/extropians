&lt;As an example of the kind of thinking that is becoming prevalent, I submit <br>

A week or two ago, when the list was down, I posted something about the new <br>
Electric Minds (www.minds.com) forum.  It's in the list archives but <br>
probably didn't make it through in email.  What I noted was that alot of <br>
the participants there seemed to be posting these same antitechnology <br>
views.  Many of them were rehashing Lewis Mumford's work (_The Myth of the <br>
Machine_) from decades ago.<br>
<p>
Kirkpatrick Sale wrote:<br>
&lt;computers interpose and mediate between the human and natural world more <br>
completely than any other technology--they are uniquely capable of <br>
reproducing another nature through biotechnology and many virtual ones--and <br>
are the instruments that primarily energize the technosphere that not <br>
merely distances this civilization from nature but sets it at war with <br>
nature for its daily sustenance.&gt;<br>
<p>
And Anders Sandberg critiqued:<br>
&lt;This is IMHO the rethorical core of his argument, and it is interesting. <br>
The first part is essentially about values: do we want to live in the <br>
natural world or in the technological (cultural) world? He sees the choice <br>
as obvious, and I suppose many of his readers do too, because nature has <br>
become a very positive word today.&gt;<br>
<p>
These people (Greenpeaceniks) might do well to read Alexander Chislenko's <br>
essay at  <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/Cyborgs.txt">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/Cyborgs.txt</a> which argues <br>
that we've been 'cyborgs' ever since we picked up our first tool.  If their <br>
nature-worship arguments are followed to their logical conclusion you <br>
arrive at what Hal Dunn first posted about last Saturday (961230):<br>
<p>
&lt;You might find this amusing.  I stumbled across the Web site for the <br>
Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.  <a href="http://www.vhemt.org/aboutvhemt.html">http://www.vhemt.org/aboutvhemt.html</a> <br>
 [snip] VHEMT wants to end all human breeding so that the human race <br>
eventually becomes extinct in order to save the earth.&gt;<br>
<p>
BTW, David Brin's latest novels (recently finished the brand-new <br>
_Infinity's Shore_, second book in a trilogy) explores this mentality as <br>
embodied in a religion that sees the Path of Redemption to be a return to <br>
pre-sapience.<br>
<p>
A few years back, some similar folks (claiming to be serious scientists) <br>
proposed putting most of the middle portions of North America (from the <br>
Rocky Mountains through parts of the Great Plains) off limits to humans so <br>
that wildlife could recover.<br>
<p>
I call these people Green Fascists.  As Eugene Leitl also put it:<br>
&lt;an oecofashistoid regime I hope we'll never get.&gt;<br>
Their primary theoretician, of course, is Jeremy Rifkin.<br>
<p>
As Max More recently put it:<br>
&lt;All forms of religious fundamentalism are antithetical towards science.&gt;<br>
IMO, there is a serious threat of these Green Fascists linking up with <br>
religious fundamentalists to try and prohibit further technological <br>
advances.  My hope is that there are enough democratic and technical <br>
networks in place that these people would be quickly isolated if they ever <br>
came to power.  My fear is that a Green Goo is all too easy to spread!<br>
