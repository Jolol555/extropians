Jeff Dee said:<br>
Our ignorance of something doesn't stop it from being true.  The burden is <br>
on *us* to find out what is actually going on, whether we can do so <br>
perfectly or not.  Telling ourselves that 'reality' is only whatever we <br>
happen to think it is at the moment is not helpful.<br>
<p>
I say, paralleling your words but not intending sarcasm:<br>
Our faith in something doesn't make it true. What is this "burden", <br>
and what contract did I sign assuming it? Forgetting that languange <br>
limits thought and that belief shapes perception is a frequent cause <br>
of misery. <br>
<p>
The guy hitting some jogger over the head with a crowbar may be real; <br>
the thing that "made" him do that may not be. Or his motives might be <br>
regarded as irrelevant. Depends on where you want to influence the <br>
system. I agree it's a little late to explain or convince once the crowbar <br>
starts its path toward the cranium...<br>
