<i>&gt; I think the Holocaust was a good example where there was a great number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people possessing bad memes which generally made them passive and refuse to</i><br>
<i>&gt; join together to fight their enemy. The Jewish people were running the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole system which made the Germans even angrier because they were doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; such an efficient job. Bad memes meant demise of a great number of people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who didn't need to die but chose to.</i><br>
<p>
The Jewish people weren't running a damn thing; they were simply the<br>
default scapegoats and got targeted again.  What is this, the Elders of<br>
Zion meme again?  And the victims of the Holocaust did not *choose* to<br>
die.  If the half-dead (and, far too often, completely dead) debarkees<br>
of the overcrowded, food and waterless death trains all charged at once,<br>
then they *might* have overrun the machine-gun-equipped and well-fed<br>
guards, after which they would have no problem but crossing a hostile<br>
empire full of Nazi tanks in rags after not eating for days.  Even if<br>
the Jewish people had all revolted at once and at the first sign of<br>
trouble, they would have been outnumbered and would simply have died.<br>
<p>
I am deeply offended by this ill-informed attempt to shift the blame for<br>
the Holocaust onto the Jews.  Please 1) retract your statements 2) watch<br>
an actual documentary about the Holocaust or 3) declare yourself an open<br>
anti-Semite.<br>

<i>&gt; The Jimson weed was growing in San Bernodino in California. Teenagers were</i><br>
<i>&gt; using the hallucinogenic drug so they decided that instead of educating and</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing them to make their own choice (not condemn the drug) they decided</i><br>
<i>&gt; to go around the area in an attempt to chop up every living plant when it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; indigenous to the area. (An impossible feat). I think they'res something</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong with this situation.</i><br>
<p>
Great idea, bad implementation.  Should've used biological warfare<br>
instead of hunting them down one by one.  Besides, any teenager with a<br>
surviving seed could have restored the species in a few years.<br>
