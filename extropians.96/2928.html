<i>&gt;Then came up the notion, which I've heard discussed </i><br>
<i>&gt;before, that our universe may have been created by a physicist/hacker from </i><br>
<i>&gt;some other universe.  So, the question was, and still is, was our universe </i><br>
<i>&gt;created by a conscious being?  Is there some awesomely powerful being creating </i><br>
<i>&gt;endless varieties of universes, tweaking with the parameters and seeing what </i><br>
<i>&gt;happens?  </i><br>
<p>
When I was a kid, my mom made me go to catholic church, catechism, and<br>
the whole bit.  I was of course reading science furiously, and she<br>
wasn't much of a catholic.  This is just what I finally decided that<br>
god was, if there was one: some guy running the universe as a<br>
simulation.  Sort of like Game of Life on a grand scale, he sets up<br>
the equations, sets the constants and the initial conditions and<br>
watches it go for a while before tweaking and starting again.<br>
<p>
I came to this conclusion when I was maybe 10.<br>
<p>
It was only later (a couple years ago) when I was reading "Atheism,<br>
Ayn Rand and Other Heresies" that I found that in the old days, this<br>
was called Deism, and that many of the US "founding fathers" held to<br>
this sort of view.<br>
<p>
Pretty interesting.<br>
<p>
I go back and forth between this view and "hard atheism".<br>
<p>
<p>
BTW, I find David's posts probably the most interesting and thought<br>
provoking currently on the list.  That may be because I've been on the<br>
list for over 5 years, so I've seen most everything else rehashed 12<br>
times already!  ;-)  But I don't think so.  Kudos.<br>
