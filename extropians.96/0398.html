<i>&gt; Rise of the TEMPEST</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; by Sarah Ellerman</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reprinted from - Internet UnderGround Magazine</i><br>
<i>&gt; June 1996 Edition Pg. 42 thru 46</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The unmarked government van slows and stops. The agent inside puts</i><br>
<i>&gt; down his coffee and starts in on the day's work: monitoring John</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doe's computer, 10 blocks away. John is busy working on his Mac with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the curtains pulled against the morning sunlight. The agent watches</i><br>
<i>&gt; with great interest as John reads through the cryptography and</i><br>
<i>&gt; privacy newsgroups, then downloads some fiction from</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.stories. Everything that flashes by on John's monitor is</i><br>
<i>&gt; videotaped for later review: the balance and payees of John's</i><br>
<i>&gt; checking account, some decrypted e-mail that John assumed was</i><br>
<i>&gt; private and an illegal copy of Adobe Photoshop.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this scenario making you take stock of what appears on your</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer screen? We all indulge in vices large and small, mentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; shrugging, "Who will ever know?" In everyday life, we usually manage</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep our transgressions secret, but when it comes to information</i><br>
<i>&gt; flitting across our computer screens, the answer is that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; no secrets, thanks to a relatively new, obscure form of surveillance</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's a threat to your privacy and your civil rights. It's so</i><br>
<i>&gt; secret that the Feds refuse to even release its real name. Privacy</i><br>
<i>&gt; advocates have filled the void by nicknaming this technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; "TEMPEST," which stands for "Transient Electromagnetic Pulse</i><br>
<i>&gt; Emanation Surveillance Technology." What it does is allow a simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; scanning device to read the output from your monitor from up to one</i><br>
<i>&gt; kilometer away. No one ever need enter your house to plant a bug or</i><br>
<i>&gt; copy your floppies; it's non invasive and virtually undetectable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You won't even know what hit you until your name gets put on a list</i><br>
<i>&gt; of troublemakers or the marshals come busting down your door.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here's how it works: There is an electron gun in the back of your</i><br>
<i>&gt; monitor which repeatedly fires electrons at your screen, causing</i><br>
<i>&gt; different pixels to illuminate and form the text or graphics that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you see. The gun sweeps rapidly up and down, sending an</i><br>
<i>&gt; electromagnetic signal which constantly refreshes the information</i><br>
<i>&gt; displayed on the screen. This signal doesn't stop at the perimeter</i><br>
<i>&gt; of your computer; it continues expanding outwards, seeping through</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ether much like a radio wave. Exposed cables act as inadvertent</i><br>
<i>&gt; antennas, transmitting the contents of your screen across your</i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhood. Information even travels back along modem lines and</i><br>
<i>&gt; power cords, back into the walls and out into the world. These</i><br>
<i>&gt; signals can be easily reconstructed. What's more, a spy can</i><br>
<i>&gt; differentiate between many different units operating in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; room. The signals don't conflict or jam each other as one might</i><br>
<i>&gt; suspect. Even identical units send out distinct signals because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; slight differ ences in the manufacturing of various components. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; may not think it, but your PC is hardly a self-contained unit</i><br>
<i>&gt; storing information privy to you alone. In fact, you're better off</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking of it as a small-scale broadcast station operating out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your house.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You may think, "So what if someone can see a screen?" Consider the</i><br>
<i>&gt; test conducted by security professionals at the Technical Assistance</i><br>
<i>&gt; Group at <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. thecodex.com who actually jury-rigged their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tempest scanning device and took it for a test drive in downtown</i><br>
<i>&gt; Manhattan this spring. As described in an essay by CEO Frank Jones,</i><br>
<i>&gt; their "DataScan" device (four years in the making) enabled them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; "view CRT screens at ATM machines, banks, the local state lottery</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine in a neighborhood candy store, a doctor's office, the local</i><br>
<i>&gt; high school, the fire department, the local police department doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; a DMV license plate check, a branch office of a securities trader</i><br>
<i>&gt; making a stock trade and the local gas station (owner) tallying up</i><br>
<i>&gt; his day's receipts...The U.S. Customs building (in NYC) leaks</i><br>
<i>&gt; information as well as the Federal Reserve. Wall Street itself was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth of information for anyone interested. The World Trade Center</i><br>
<i>&gt; was fertile. It afforded open parking areas nearby with millions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; glass windows to snoop. We headed east toward the New York Post</i><br>
<i>&gt; newspaper offices and read the latest news off their monitors (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; was printed the next day). We headed north toward City Hall and NYPD</i><br>
<i>&gt; Police Headquarters. Guess what? They're not Tempest-certified</i><br>
<i>&gt; either...Neither is the United Nations, any of the midtown banks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Con Edison (the power company), New York Telephone on 42nd Street or</i><br>
<i>&gt; Trump Tower!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although this kind of eavesdropping has been featured in the media,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most people are unaware of the ease with which spies can virtually</i><br>
<i>&gt; look over their shoulder. Most react with incredulity swelling into</i><br>
<i>&gt; anger and fear when the technology is demonstrated to them. However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; specialists agree that the average person should not be unduly</i><br>
<i>&gt; concerned with being spied on. "No, by and large it's not used to</i><br>
<i>&gt; crack down on the common criminal," says Winn Schwartau, author of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Information Warfare and Security Insider Report. "You've got to look</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the expense that goes into one of these things, the eavesdropping</i><br>
<i>&gt; vans and equipment. It's not cheap stuff to do at the very highest</i><br>
<i>&gt; levels. As a number of prosecutors have told me, 'I wish so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; people wouldn't be so paranoid. They don't know we don't have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time or the budget to waste on them.' I wouldn't worry for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual reader; I'd worry for the corporation that has something</i><br>
<i>&gt; of value."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mike, an electronic surveillance specialist (who requested that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; not print his last name) and proprietor of the Chicago-area Discreet</i><br>
<i>&gt; Electronics and Security, Inc. at <a href="http://www.w2">http://www.w2</a>.</i><br>
<i>&gt; com/docs2/z/spyshop. html, also warns the public to keep things in</i><br>
<i>&gt; perspective. "Let's say you are invaded, and there's an outrage at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the invasion. It may be that your federal rights were violated...</i><br>
<i>&gt; but so what?" he says. "One variable in how to assess</i><br>
<i>&gt; countermeasures and detec tion devices is to figure out how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage could happen to you as a result of your privacy being</i><br>
<i>&gt; invaded." What could someone find out from your screen that would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; of enough value or interest for them to go to the trouble and</i><br>
<i>&gt; expense of getting a crack at your intellectual property? Pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; curiosity? Unlikely. A nasty divorce or child custody case? The pur</i><br>
<i>&gt; suit of a suspected hacker? A suspicion that you stole company</i><br>
<i>&gt; secrets? Maybe. "If, on the other hand, you're involved in something</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's rather political, if you're suing an insurance company for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; $500,000 worker's compensation claim, boy, there's a lot involved</i><br>
<i>&gt; here," Mike says. "And they're going to do whatever they have to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe it or not, to get their information."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; GOOD NEWS BAD NEW</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Paranoid or protective U.S. citizens and companies can purchase</i><br>
<i>&gt; snoop-proof" Tempest-certified" computers for their own use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, the high cost of such a secure system may be prohibitive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumers, says Jules Rutstein, program manager for Secure Systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; at Wang Federal, Inc. Even after paying through the nose,</i><br>
<i>&gt; information on how the computer was modified to meet the undisclosed</i><br>
<i>&gt; emissions standards is top-secret. Wang, found at</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.wangfed.com">http://www.wangfed.com</a>, a leading supplier of computers to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government, offers an affordable alternative to Tempest products,</i><br>
<i>&gt; called ZONE. Rutstein explains, "The ZONE alternative is a lighter</i><br>
<i>&gt; version of the full Tempest program. The ZONE program is actually an</i><br>
<i>&gt; endorsed program under NSA (the National Security Agency.)" The cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ZONE protection is significantly less than Tempest-certified</i><br>
<i>&gt; units, but Rutstein wouldn't provide IU with definitive figures. "We</i><br>
<i>&gt; try to price our ZONE products at what we consider commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices. I'm ambivalent because it's so difficult to pin down prices</i><br>
<i>&gt; on PC products today...We've been selling it from the position that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can purchase a ZONE product for virtually the same price as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal system. It's not costing you any more." IU pressed to find</i><br>
<i>&gt; the exact difference between the products, but emission levels are</i><br>
<i>&gt; top secret information, and ZONE can only be measured as relative to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tempest. It is probably safe to say that ZONE products would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable for the average consumer's privacy needs, which is good</i><br>
<i>&gt; news for those concerned enough with security to purchase a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer. The bad news is that you don't have the highest level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; security.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Information about exactly how the process works is veiled. Seminars</i><br>
<i>&gt; on building Tempest-certified equipment are only available to</i><br>
<i>&gt; persons with certain security clearances, and rumor has it that</i><br>
<i>&gt; people attempting to talk about Tempest are often silenced with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; excuse that they're creating a security threat. Rutstein says,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Tempest is a munitions controlled item, which means that the export</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the product is controlled. . . Currently the only foreign</i><br>
<i>&gt; entities we sell to are NATO governments." These prohibitions</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect the U.S. from acts of terrorism, but the secrecy surrounding</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tempest specifications creates a dilemma for citizens. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; government's reticence about standards prevents us from properly</i><br>
<i>&gt; shielding the normal computers we already own. We can guess what</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of emissions they're giving off and try to suppress them, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; without cold hard data, we can never rcally be sure. Most people</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't even know of the existence of the technology, much less the</i><br>
<i>&gt; exact shielding specifications. "It is not possible for the average</i><br>
<i>&gt; person to go to a database and find out what is Tempest certified</i><br>
<i>&gt; and what is not. I believe that perhaps that's the way the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government wants it," says Jones of the Technical Assistance Group.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jones feels that citizens should be able to test emanations on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own. He points out that "there are several ways of blocking</i><br>
<i>&gt; unintended transmissions, but how effective are they? The people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacture shielding always say, 'it's great, it's effective,' but</i><br>
<i>&gt; you don't really know. But now there is a way to test it. We built a</i><br>
<i>&gt; room and we used woven shielding with the DataScan device and it did</i><br>
<i>&gt; block emissions, but it didn't block them to their specs. We had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use close to twice what they thought was secure to actually make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; room secure." Mike of Discreet Electronics and Security, Inc. also</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes out in favor of defensive countermeasures, saying, "Used in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the application of creating awareness, to show how vulnerable let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, a bank could be, it actually serves a very high and valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose. The idea here is to create an awareness, because most</i><br>
<i>&gt; people don't know, and what's frightening is that they don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they don't know."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; YEAH, BUT IS IT LEGAL?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jones says it's somewhat unclear whether citizens can lawfully</i><br>
<i>&gt; monitor electromagnetic emanations. Depending on how one interprets</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 1986 Electronic Communications and Privacy Act, it seems it</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be legal. According to Jones, the 1986 measure covers, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; depth, that "it is illegal to own, possess or use any device whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; primary purpose is the surreptitious interception of ora/ or data</i><br>
<i>&gt; communications." How does this apply to Tempest scanning devices?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, that depends on how you define the word "data. "</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tempest works by picking up computer emanations that happen to seep</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the ether, remember? Those electrons were not created to</i><br>
<i>&gt; transfer information to another party; rather, they were created for</i><br>
<i>&gt; putting images on a computer screen, many theorize. "The emanations</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not communications, it's not 'data' by the definition of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; word," Jones says. "They are spurious emissions that are nothing but</i><br>
<i>&gt; white noise. It's garbage."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So what about the Act's clause that forbids the "interception of</i><br>
<i>&gt; intended communications?" That's where things get complicated,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schwartau admits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The key word there is 'intended,' that's exactly correct,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schwartau says. "I've posed this question of Tempest interception to</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawyers and judges. The operational phrase came out of some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cellular interception, the mobile home phone interception: Those are</i><br>
<i>&gt; intentional broadcasts, and interception of those is clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal." Schwartau says that legal colleagues agree with Jones'</i><br>
<i>&gt; assertion that intercepting unintentional, surreptitious emanations</i><br>
<i>&gt; from electronic equipment is not illegal. "However, there have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; other lawyers who've maintained--and these operate on the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; side--that "we'd find a way to get you."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the end, no matter how brilliant an argument lawyers can make</i><br>
<i>&gt; that such transmissions "don't count," there's only one</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpretation that really matters: namely, the definition decided</i><br>
<i>&gt; on by the government. "That is the end-all and be-all," says Mike of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Discreet Electronics and Security, Inc. "If the government says it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal, then guess what? It's illegal."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So although the consensus may be that current law leaves a</i><br>
<i>&gt; convenient loophole that technically permits Tempest monitoring, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prudent person shouldn't risk it. "I can modify a black-and-white</i><br>
<i>&gt; television set, with seven cents in parts, to make it work. Does</i><br>
<i>&gt; that make my TV illegal? No, of course not," says Schwartau. "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment that the government uses to monitor and test this type of</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment is open sale equipment. There are no clearances required.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schwartau believes that even while providers' motivations in selling</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tempest scanning equipment may be questionable, it's clearly legal</i><br>
<i>&gt; for them to sell the stuff. Using it is another question. "lt's</i><br>
<i>&gt; shaky ground if I'm going to go out and intercept the signals</i><br>
<i>&gt; surreptitiously, but you also have to ask the question: How can you</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecute something that is passive and invisible?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's a good point and a chief concern for privacy advocates. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; monitoring is so non-invasive that most people will never even have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a clue that they were spied on. Many fear that the government will</i><br>
<i>&gt; abuse their privileged position as the keepers of Tempest standards</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that the situation could turn into an unconstitutional,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one-sided information war. As a consequence, there is a grass-roots</i><br>
<i>&gt; movement of people learning to protect themselves. In his article</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Tempest in a Teapot" at http:t/www.quadralay.com/</i><br>
<i>&gt; www/Crypt/Tempest/ tempest.html, Grady Ward notes that concerned</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer users can take a number of simple steps to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; compromising emanations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ward suggests keeping cables between components as short as</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible, to reduce the length of cable that acts as an antenna and</i><br>
<i>&gt; to use only shielded cable which is wrapped with metal to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; emissions within the sheath. He recommends that users make sure that</i><br>
<i>&gt; all computers and peripherals that they use meet the Federal</i><br>
<i>&gt; Communications Commission's Class B standard which permits only one</i><br>
<i>&gt; tenth the power of spurious emissions than the Class A standard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ward also instructs users to keep the cover on their computer, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; mount telephone-line filter products at the jack of the modem and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; snap metallic ferrite beads over all cables so that offending</i><br>
<i>&gt; electromagnetic emissions are used up in a heat sink instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; being released into the air.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Those who feel the need to protect truly valuable information can</i><br>
<i>&gt; take further steps by altering the rooms in which they work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "You don't need the proverbial lead-lined room anymore," Jones says.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "There are composite non wovens that are similar to wallpaper that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can do a room in: the walls, the ceiling, the floors. Paste the</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff on the walls and then put paneling or regular wallpaper over</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, and it pretty much makes the room secure. It blocks the</i><br>
<i>&gt; electromagnetic emissions from going out. There also is translucent</i><br>
<i>&gt; shielding similar to the sun tinting in an automobile that you put</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the windows."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schwartau offers an alternative, saying, "The least expensive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; easiest way to do it is electromagnetic moire' pattern masking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That' a technique using an inline box that plugs between the monitor</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the video card on your PC. It creates an electromagnetic moire</i><br>
<i>&gt; pattern that for all intents and purposes would keep out everybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the absolutely most dedicated national resources."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What's more, the active-matrix screens now built into laptops</i><br>
<i>&gt; operate with out electron guns and their emissions are much lower.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When such screens are commonly used as desktop monitors the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility for being spied on will be lessened.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Active matrix ? Electromagnetic moire? Isn't all this a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; extreme ? Maybe not. Privacy advocates note that Tempest monitoring</i><br>
<i>&gt; is just one facet of an information war in which the government has</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unfair upper hand. We probably don't need to remind you, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. government has not always demonstrated the best judgment when</i><br>
<i>&gt; it comes to emerging technologies, individual rights or covert</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions involving "dangerous"citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The hope is that public indignation about Tempest monitoring will</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause a true tempest, a whirlwind of anger and official</i><br>
<i>&gt; accountability. Only then will we have the same tools and</i><br>
<i>&gt; information as the Feds, bringing the battle onto an even playing</i><br>
<i>&gt; field.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps strife, outcry and controversy during this period of rapidly</i><br>
<i>&gt; emerging technology would not be such a bad thing. Consider these</i><br>
<i>&gt; words from Shakespeare's Orthello: "If after every tempest come such</i><br>
<i>&gt; calms, may the winds blow till they have waken'd death!"</i><br>
