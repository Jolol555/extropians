Don't worry, I don't take offense that easily.<br>
<p>
OK, in my original post I was playing agent provocateur.  (I hope that's<br>
permitted here -- I didn't see anything in the FAQ that prohibits it.)<br>
<p>
So I agree, I would want to have both intellectual and physical existence.<br>
But I'm still not at all convinced I would want to simulate or mimic animal<br>
pleasures.<br>
<p>
While evolution may have required pleasure as a response to sustenance and<br>
sex, I would think transhumanists would want to link pleasure to learning<br>
and creating.<br>
<p>
Another (related) small project I'm working on is the meaning of life.  &lt;g&gt;<br>
Until we can prove the universe is going to reach a steady-state and is<br>
eternal, it seems to me we should assume that it is dying.  Therefore, the<br>
purpose of life is to acquire the knowledge and means to prevent it from<br>
happening.  This is one of the things that attracted me to extropianism --<br>
most people do not seem sufficiently anxious about this, because they do<br>
not believe immortality is possible.  The ultimate tragedy would be if<br>
intelligent life fell just one hour short of conquering nature...<br>
