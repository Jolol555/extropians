More self ownership alternatives to a juried closed list:<br>
- those who feel that they are qualified to judge what *is* quality, and/or<br>
 who are respected as "elders" in the list, could come up with some sort of<br>
system where they *star* or flag items which they find particularly<br>
valuable... giving a guideline to what is expected, also keeping it positive<br>
and constructive!  <br>
Especially helpful in that  one could judge the quality by one's sown<br>
criteria, not some removed committe or random selection of peers.... for<br>
example if it was starred by some one I really respect, i would tend to read<br>
that more than if someone starred it who i didnt.<br>
