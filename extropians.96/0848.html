Max Moore writes in response:<br>
<p>
&lt;You might have no choice. You seem to assume that &gt;H level<br>
intelligences  to be actively benign, leaving you a sufficient part of<br>
resources. I  suspect the scenario to be Darwinian/ALifish, where first<br>
the easily  accessible (Belt, Kuiper, Oort, atmosphereless satellites)<br>
resources get  rapidly depleted&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't assume that &gt;H level intelligences will be benign by chance.  I<br>
assume we'll design their initial matrix behavior that way.  Your<br>
assumption of the resource insatiability of such future intelligences<br>
seems possible but not probable, unless you assume that this insatiability<br>
ceases with the consumption of the home system.  Otherwise, isn't it<br>
logical to assume that such insatiability would have already converted all<br>
star systems and interstellar resources?  Unless of course, we assume<br>
we're the first to come up with the concept.  It is possible we are first. <br>
Somebody has to be.  <br>
<p>
Another point--all higher intelligences will have to have purpose, not just<br>
program, otherwise you're liable to get a very high "suicide" rate the<br>
greater the intelligences becomes in successive design generations.  If<br>
we are talking about self-aware intelligences.  You may not be.<br>
<p>
You also slogan:<br>
&lt;Darwin days, even in the digital Eden.&gt;<br>
<p>
This I see repeatedly as the limit of your analysis.   A belief that<br>
Darwinian competition and natural selection has as it's outcome the<br>
triumph of the most EFFICIENT--especially in terms of energy and<br>
chemical usage.  Were this so, nature would never have "selected"<br>
beyond the bacterium--which is still the winner today in the biological<br>
fist-fight.  But Darwinian evolution also involves the biological niche--the<br>
debate is still out as to whether organisms just fill niches or create them. <br>
And natural selection "within" a species is even more cumbersomea<br>
quandry.  And it usually comes down to the biological question of not<br>
"what is efficient?" but rather, "what is sexy?"  Often arbitrary, quite<br>
different for a peacock or a person.  The evolution of the intellectual and<br>
cultural idiosyncracies of the human mind certainly lie outside of<br>
mathematical equations of resource and reproductive efficiency.  Most of<br>
what humanity does every day as a species, and every day as an<br>
individual has little to do with efficiency.  I would agree that it's<br>
competitive.  But "within" our species, and more often, just within our<br>
tribe.  You don't see the Masi tribesmen trying desperately to become<br>
stockbrokers because it's very competitive--A New York stockbroker<br>
with a fair income has many more resources at his disposal, and a much<br>
longer lifespan, and his children will have better also.  So why don't the<br>
Masi want to also?  What is the "purpose" of art?  What makes a<br>
breeding partner sexy? <br>
<p>
Point being, that a hyperintelligent mind is likely to be less subject to<br>
mathematical behavior analysis than we are, not less.  It's likely to be<br>
less "logical" in it's reasons, that the arbitrariness of humanity.  It's<br>
certain to be more complex.   A "social" group of such &gt;H minds is likely<br>
to be unfathenable in its behavior--and perhaps very inefficient and<br>
illogical to outside analysis indeed.<br>
<p>
As an economist, I can say that people are not "rational actors" not in<br>
groups and not as individuals.  We act based on "human" motivations. <br>
Not what is most efficient.  The most efficient humans are the ones to<br>
always succeed.  Were that true, geniuses would all be multi-millionaires<br>
with hundreds of children.<br>
<p>
Should we apply this efficiency analysis to corporations? Nations?<br>
<p>
Somehow, it doesn't work out that way.<br>
<p>
Max, do you really think that these &gt;H entities will have the behavior<br>
motivations of bacteria--just added to the power to disassemble any<br>
planet that looks tasty?<br>
