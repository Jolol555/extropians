Here's what I am hoping this list will be: a place for people who fervently<br>
believe in intellectual and technological progress to test and refine (or<br>
discard) their ideas.<br>
<p>
At the risk of oversimplifying, I have found there are basically two kinds<br>
of people on the net: those who are interested in getting at the truth, and<br>
those who are simply looking for validation of what they already believe.<br>
The former tend to become thick-skinned, because they know how easy it is<br>
to be sarcastic in this medium; besides, they are more interested in the<br>
issues than their own feelings.  The latter, however, see every criticism<br>
of their ideas as an attack against their person.<br>
<p>
Yes Kathyrn, I can't help but laugh when you say "I sense a strong<br>
exclusionary tone on this list."  Everyone else is too busy getting their<br>
own ideas beat up to think about excluding you.<br>
