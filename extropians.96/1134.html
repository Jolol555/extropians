<p>
Offhand, I can't think of any really large-scale conspiracy theories which<br>
have turned out true, but then on the other hand there certainly have been<br>
a number of authoritarian conspiracies among highly-placed figures which<br>
have turned out true, even though these have been small-scale. The Nixon<br>
circle's Watergate conspiracy. The Nazi conspiracy to destroy the Weimar<br>
constitution (this was not the platform that they were elected on,<br>
exactly). The currently debated Whitewater conspiracy. And then there was<br>
the Guy Fawkes conspiracy, just to show that those who are out of power can<br>
cook up some sophisticated cabals as well.<br>
<p>
The "grand-scale" conspiracy theorists often point to the fact that these<br>
smaller conspiracies are usually not traced to their roots... they are only<br>
traced a certain distance before the conspirators' efforts to destroy<br>
evidence (and witnesses) succeed in foiling the detectives. And from this<br>
they surmise that there really are grand-scale conspiracies operating<br>
throughout history, of which these smaller-scale authoritarian conspiracies<br>
are mere outcroppings.<br>
<p>
The point James Daugherty just made about how people operating in their<br>
ordinary unquestioned modes of thinking can often be participating in a<br>
conspiracy without even being aware that they are conspiring is a good one.<br>
I have lately been amazed by how little people are aware of what they are<br>
doing, since I've just recently become aware of a few things that I've been<br>
working hard toward all my life without being aware of doing so until now.<br>
I'm sure more such revelations await me in the future, as I become able to<br>
devote a few more leisure hours to introspection than I used to.<br>
<p>
I used to think that conspiracy theories were a bunch of hooey, and I'd<br>
still be suspicious about (a) those who swallow them hook, line, and sinker<br>
and (b) those who seek to convince young and gullible people of their<br>
truth. But since I've managed to deal with the "harsher realities" of<br>
carving out a comfortable living for myself in the world, I feel that I can<br>
now be little more "soft in the head", and after investigating some of the<br>
conspiracy theories myself, I think they are worth investigating by some<br>
people.<br>
<p>
If I ever get rich and take care of most of my personal goals and don't see<br>
any more pressing problems on my horizon (like industrializing the Jovian<br>
moons or writing a choral ballet that Ravel would be envious of), then I<br>
might take up keeping an eye on the Trilateral Commission as an interesting<br>
hobby which might be potentially far more valuable than, say, watching<br>
football. And since I'm not the type to take football fans to task for<br>
their vices, I don't think I'd be interested in arguing against conspiracy<br>
theorists either. I'm glad they're keeping an eye on things... just in<br>
case.<br>
<p>
The only caution that remains, of course, is that the Nazis did their<br>
damage, in part, by exploiting the fears of anti-Semitic conspiracy<br>
theorists. And this may be the main reason why I'm not interested in taking<br>
up the abovementioned hobby for myself at this point in history.<br>
