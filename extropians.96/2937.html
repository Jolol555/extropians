<i>&gt;Some people on the list, such as Davin Enigl and James Rogers, </i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to have had extensive experience with federal agencies.  Maybe </i><br>
<i>&gt;we should get some input from them.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
In my experience with federal agencies (and having worked for federal<br>
agencies), the people who work there aren't nice because they don't have to<br>
be nice.  Being nice has no impact on their jobs.  Unfortunately, many<br>
federal employees are under the impression that citizens REQUIRE their<br>
services, often leading to a small power trip for the federal worker<br>
involved.  From my own personal experiences, I can tell you that being nice<br>
or pleasant in no way impacts a federal employees job performance appraisal.<br>
Showing up to work is about the only requirement, and even that is kind of<br>
fuzzy.<br>
<p>
And another thing:  People work for federal agencies because they are not<br>
capable or competent enough to get a job in the private sector.  The people<br>
who work for the government are from the bottom of the barrel.  Anyone who<br>
is any good quits and works for the private sector.  This is the reason I<br>
don't work for DoD any more.  What happens is you get a concentration of<br>
people who would *never* cut it in the private sector.  The federal<br>
government is the employer of last resort.<br>
<p>
And yet another reason:  People are promoted based on seniority, not<br>
qualification.  The cream does not rise to the top in the federal government.<br>
And people wonder why so many government agencies are mismanaged.<br>
<p>
That said, there are a few agencies in the government who have their act<br>
together, but they are far and few between.  I think many government<br>
employees need to be reminded that they work for *us*.  <br>
