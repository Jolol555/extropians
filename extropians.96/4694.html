<i>&gt;I am deeply offended by this ill-informed attempt to shift the blame for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Holocaust onto the Jews.  Please 1) retract your statements 2) watch</i><br>
<i>&gt;an actual documentary about the Holocaust or 3) declare yourself an open</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-Semite.</i><br>
<p>
Ahhh, a sacred cow! I'm not saying it was their fault, I'm saying they<br>
didn't exactly do their best to prevent it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even if</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Jewish people had all revolted at once and at the first sign of</i><br>
<i>&gt;trouble, they would have been outnumbered and would simply have died.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is a pretty big assumption.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The Jimson weed was growing in San Bernodino in California. Teenagers were</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; using the hallucinogenic drug so they decided that instead of educating and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; allowing them to make their own choice (not condemn the drug) they decided</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to go around the area in an attempt to chop up every living plant when it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; indigenous to the area. (An impossible feat). I think they'res something</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wrong with this situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Great idea, bad implementation.  Should've used biological warfare</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of hunting them down one by one.  Besides, any teenager with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;surviving seed could have restored the species in a few years.</i><br>
<p>
WHAT?!? You're suggesting species extinction over blatant human ignorance?<br>
Who gives you the right to drive another species to extinction? Humans will<br>
only find other methods of getting high. If many people were able to get<br>
high off of smoking their own shit would you make that illegal too? You<br>
must stop the problem at the source which is depression and lack of optimism.<br>

 to lose sight of the shore"<br>
