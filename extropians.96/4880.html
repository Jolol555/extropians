I'm afraid Michael Lorrey has read far more into my parenthesis<br>
than I intended to put there. I certainly didn't expect to have to<br>
put up a follow-up post dealing with just that, but hey, I don't<br>
want to get kicked out of the NRA. (Actually, I quit the NRA, but<br>
only because they insist on supporting the Republican Party.)<br>
<p>
My sin was not in going unarmed but in failing to pay adequate<br>
attention to my immediate environment.  What can I say, it had been<br>
a long day and I was tired and not in a good frame of mind to resist<br>
the temptation to get lost in thought about whatever I was daydreaming<br>
about at the time. I was surprised from behind, quietly.  Perhaps<br>
if I took some more ninjutsu classes, I'd learn an effective defense<br>
against this maneuver, but the defense that I did come up with<br>
(running away as fast as I could while screaming at the top of my<br>
lungs) worked in that particular situation, so I was lucky. However,<br>
drawing down on the fellow after he had rested his barrel on my<br>
temple would have been suicidal--far more so than what I actually<br>
did. I recognized the pistol by feel, because it felt exactly like<br>
my own Glock 19.<br>
<p>
The sad thing is that after I reached back to remove the miscreant's<br>
hand from my collar, discovered his automatic pistol (with my hand),<br>
and made my instant decision, I didn't even give the rascal any time<br>
to ask for my wallet. As a result, the only thing they could write down<br>
on the police report describing the offense was "brandishing firearm".<br>
Something to think about the next time you research police crime stats.<br>
<p>
And I certainly hope you didn't mean to tar me with that "pro individual<br>
freedom yet anti RKBA" brush. When I was going on about the evils of<br>
flying lead pellets, I was under no delusion that "gun control" laws<br>
are of any use in minimizing such evils. My own opinion is that decent<br>
human beings are in no short supply, and that the more of them are <br>
well armed, the less trouble we can expect from those human beings<br>
who fall well below the minimum standards of decency.<br>
