<i>                &gt;I love my own privacy and strive to protect it.  However I </i><br>
<i>                &gt;also see the inevitability of its decay as the rich, mighty, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and a techno-elite gain powers I can never hope to match.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I see no reason why the rich would increase their power over me as the<br>
information age progresses, in fact I am confident the opposite is true. My<br>
confidence comes not from politics but from Mathematics and the power of<br>
exponential growth. In general, if I increase the complexity of my encryption<br>
algorithm so that it takes me twice as long to encrypt a message, I have made<br>
it not twice, but millions of times more difficult for an attacker to break<br>
my code. The government has access to more powerful computers than I do, but<br>
not that much more powerful. There is just no getting around it, recent<br>
developments in mathematics and communication have tipped the balance away<br>
from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader, and that is the<br>
Achilles heel of government.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;Am I right in positing that Finney would defend to the death </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the right of these lords of capital to evade scrutiny, even </i><br>
<i>                &gt;though conspiratorial aristocrats destroyed more freedom in </i><br>
<i>                &gt;history than bureaucrats ever have?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All the bad things that corporations have ever done from the beginning of time<br>
amounts to little more than mischief compared to the monstrous evils that<br>
governments routinely perpetrate. Companies may be tough with competitors<br>
and rude to customers, but they don't build huge death camps and then shove<br>
people into ovens.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;In fact, they cannot cite a single example from human </i><br>
<i>                &gt;history in which freedom was enhanced by selling masks and </i><br>
<i>                &gt;chadors to the poor.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
How about those who sold phony ID cards and false identities to Jews in Nazi<br>
Germany?                            <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;In a general atmosphere of candor [...] The Mafia wouldn't </i><br>
<i>                &gt;stand a chance.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And that would be a pity. The Mafia is successful because it supplies goods<br>
and services that people want, the big money makers sometimes hurt those who<br>
freely choose them, like drugs prostitution and gambling but that's the price<br>
of freedom. Some Mafia endeavors like money laundering are positively noble,<br>
it helps people protect their money from being stolen by government thugs.<br>

<i>                &gt;he [Hal] advocates that we enter a huge, dangerous experiment,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;encouraging people to cold-shoulder each other </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You claimed Hal was engaged in a willful and eager misinterpretation  of<br>
your views, I seem to remember that very recently somebody did the same to<br>
Hal. If you give me a minute I can think of his name.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Without accountability, freedom will die.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Thus I assume you also oppose using a secret ballot in elections.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Only if those efforts are not about privacy at all, but are </i><br>
<i>                &gt;about paranoic secrecy.  Inability to see the difference </i><br>
<i>                &gt;(and there is one) plagues the self righteous.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, there is a difference, but a great debate exists on where that line is.<br>
I think each individual should draw that line for himself, you say our master<br>
should do it for us.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Not once have I heard a cypherpunk admit the existence of an </i><br>
<i>                &gt;entire class of solutions to the privacy dilemmas we face</i><br>
<i>                &gt;the mutual transparency class, which should be part of any </i><br>
<i>                &gt;mature discussion of these issues.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can think of yet another entire class of solutions we don't talk about much,<br>
one in which everybody agrees to be a nice person and live in peace love and<br>
happiness. Although this would certainly lead to a wonderful world it's<br>
pointless to talk about because there is obviously no way to implement it.<br>
<p>
I find it difficult to take seriously your assertion that The Government is <br>
the most transparent part of society, not with warehouses full of documents<br>
marked "Secret" from the First World War. A transparent society would have<br>
some flaws but I will concede it would have some virtues too. Both are<br>
irrelevant. Politicians and bureaucrats would rather piss on a spark plug<br>
than stand for such a thing. You yourself gave the reason why they would<br>
react to this idea with such horror:<br>
<p>
 "Every tyranny in history based its power first and foremost on denying<br>
  outsiders the ability to see the in-group's machinations."  <br>
  <br>
The great thing about Crypto Anarchy is that it can be implemented, and we<br>
don't need permission from our masters to do so, in fact they have no way to<br>
stop it.          <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>             &gt;Now tell me which ancient empire you'd rather have been born in.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I wouldn't trade places with anyone in the past, but enlightened policy<br>
decisions emanating from Washington can't take credit for that, technological<br>
progress can.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;No mass government in all of history has known as much about</i><br>
<i>                &gt;its people as ours does.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The former USSR knew much more about its citizens that the USA government<br>
knows about its people. It knew how much you earned and who you worked for<br>
(the state) it knew what you bought and who you bought it from (the state).<br>
Anything, literally anything, the state didn't know about you it could find<br>
out in very short order, not with a high tech gadget but with a rubber hose.<br>
Please understand, I'm not talking about finding some more raw statistics,<br>
I'm talking about learning about your hopes and dreams and fears and weakness,<br>
the very essence of your being.<br>
                                                                                                                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The obvious fact is that there is zero correlation between</i><br>
<i>                &gt;limiting the governments access to information and our</i><br>
<i>                &gt;freedom.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Until now nobody has been very successful in limiting governments access to<br>
information. There is reason to believe that modern technology will change<br>
that.                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;it will not matter an iota whether we are all armed with PGP.</i><br>
<i>                &gt;Aristos and bureaucrats will conspire together with impunity,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;and eventually crush us. [...] Almost every time the govt has</i><br>
<i>                &gt;succeeded  in making something secret, it has proven to be a</i><br>
<i>                &gt;disaster.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This looks like a contradiction on your part to me. I agree that huge<br>
conspiracies and ironclad secrecy leads to inefficiency because the many<br>
people involved are only allowed to know a tiny part of the puzzle.<br>
The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. This is one reason<br>
governments work so poorly and why their massive conspiracy will be no match<br>
against millions of small but efficient conspiracies.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;PGP is defeated pretty easily by a battering ram and armed</i><br>
<i>                &gt;storm troopers.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And government is defeated pretty easily if it has no money, and if it can't<br>
find your assets it can't extort taxes from you.<br>
<p>
