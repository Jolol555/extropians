<p>
The only scientifically accurate one I know of, has started with <br>
1972-something, and counts seconds (alas, it's a 32-bit counter). If it <br>
comes to clustering, we should use a binary counter, this is most logical <br>
order I am aware of. (And it better had be a large one, let's count <br>
microseconds with a 128 bit counter).<br>
<p>
Since we're going to have ubiguitous GPS/LPS systems, we'll soon be able <br>
to fix space at cm or better, and time at microsecond, or better anywhere <br>
on Earth or LEO.<br>
<p>
Such knowledge is crucial for routing, whether material agents or data <br>
(geodetic routing).<br>
<p>
Consider an augmented reality, with realtime 3d headup maps (DMD), and <br>
DGPS/Earth magnetic field/gravity tracking. These are things we'll have <br>
in a decade, or sooner. (Some of us, much sooner).<br>
