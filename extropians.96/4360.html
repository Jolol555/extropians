That yoga bit of Lyle's reminded me of something that happened to me<br>
once, way back when.<br>
<p>
This game was played with with two people and three blocks.  We were not<br>
told what the rules were.  So first, the guy takes two blocks.  In<br>
response, I take three blocks.  He takes one of them back.  I take the<br>
three blocks and set up a bridge.  He takes them and sets up a different<br>
bridge...<br>
<p>
At the end of the game, I was asked "Who won?"  Yes, my opponent had<br>
won.  You see, I had been absent the day this game was introduced to<br>
everyone else, so when it was played with me, I thought my opponent knew<br>
the rules.  There weren't any, but he knew that and I didn't.  So when I<br>
was playing, I got sort of frantic and desperate; I would try elaborate<br>
strategems, while my opponent calmly switched blocks back and forth. <br>
Yes, I lost.<br>
<p>
What did I learn from this?  I don't know that I could put it into<br>
words.  In one sense I was defeated by my conviction that I was losing,<br>
so I "defeated myself", but not in the same sense as Lyle's anxiety<br>
interfered with his auditory short-term memory.  The main moral is that<br>
if you remove all the rules from the game, what remains is the<br>
psychology of competition; and now I know to handle that in its most<br>
elemental form.  Perhaps some of it has spilled over into more rarefied<br>
forms.<br>
<p>
Moral of the story:  If the rules aren't clear, do your best to believe<br>
you're winning.  (This only applies in debates and such; I would not<br>
advise using it in science or engineering.) <br>
