&lt;&lt;  Having worked for some very wealthy individuals, I can verify the<br>
 observation first made by George Gilder that successful entrepreneurs are<br>
 far less "greedy" than the average person on welfare. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The wealthy people I currently work for are really down-to-earth common<br>
people who got wealthy by creating food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and<br>
nutritional supplement companies.  I work for companies who employ hundreds<br>
of thousands of people.  The owners are not greedy at all.  They pay well for<br>
my services and we are both happy. <br>
<p>
The first company I worked for full time had 40 employees in 1979 and 80 in<br>
1987.  The company was started in the 1940s and still had many of the<br>
original employees in 1987.   The owners could not have had such a low<br>
turnover rate by being greedy.  They were successful and in eight years<br>
(1979-1987) they went from 21 million to 200 million in sales.  The sales per<br>
employees was (21 million /40 employees) 5,250,000 in 1979 and (200<br>
million/80) 25,000,000 in 1987.<br>
<p>
Why were the employees so productive?   The owners were NOT greedy and the<br>
employees knew it.  We all worked as if  WE were the owners of the company<br>
(self-employed).<br>
