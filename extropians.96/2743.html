Actually, this is a very good point. Both as a rehearsal and a way to<br>
start your gradual uploading (I plan to put together my own first system<br>
quite soonish, in fact). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The BIG problem with this scenario, however, is that it might kill the </i><br>
<i>&gt; sacred cow of "H. accelerans". The need (under ER) for real-world </i><br>
<i>&gt; interaction and the desire to make use of *all* available substrates for </i><br>
<i>&gt; data storage, communication and computation makes it unlikely that </i><br>
<i>&gt; gradually uploaded, or augmented, minds would be much faster than analog </i><br>
<i>&gt; meat minds (at least initially). Also, an ER-based mind would likely want </i><br>
<i>&gt; to use distributed sensing and computing components.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think H accelerans becomes impossible with this scenario, just<br>
different. The brute force HA would just be a human with a mind<br>
accelerated significantly, while a person using advanced ER could have a<br>
myriad search agents, remembrance agents, planners, visualizers and<br>
interfacers running very quickly, feeding him with information and<br>
suggesting what to do. If the user took the plunge, they could even<br>
(assuming sufficient sophistication) act for him, creating a fast, dynamic<br>
exoself where the human is the main core for processing values and<br>
long-term goals (supported by a motivational co-processor?). This is<br>
actually quite similar to how consciousness seem to act: a slow, rather<br>
limited control system that influences the much faster and powerful<br>
unconscious subsystems. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BUT, a serious </i><br>
<i>&gt; disadvantage is that a gradual uploading approach, such as that proposed by </i><br>
<i>&gt; Algimantas Malickas, might not be able to capture *all* of the memories and </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotional/value preferences that might be burried in deep neural structures </i><br>
<i>&gt; because, as Malickas admits:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;The gradual uploading would be uploading of mind functions, not uploading </i><br>
<i>&gt; of a morphological brain architectures.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this may be a serious problem (especially if you have the "wrong" <br>
views on personal identity; people like me who identify with their memes<br>
and behavior have less trouble with this). If the brain dies/is removed<br>
before enough has been transmitted, we just have a diffuse system with no<br>
motivation or initial memories. What can be transmitted seems to be mainly<br>
memes and what we can encode. <br>
