You are absolutely correct. I see, one can come to integrate whatever it is<br>
into one's daily habits. Good...<br>
<p>
This is the concept of 'flow". it is fascinating to me. <br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Now if you find out what this is, access it chemically and make a smart</i><br>
drug<br>
<i> &gt; for non artists to join us in our bliss and flow, that would be lovely!</i><br>
But I<br>
<i> &gt; have a hint for you - best way to make a muscle grow is to exercise it. </i><br>
 <br>
<i> 	&gt;.I do and fully intend to continue, but I think that it is in the</i><br>
 spirit of extropy to find improved methods to expand ones mind, to make it<br>
 better, enhance it.  Why go with brute force and stay within the limits<br>
 when you can use intellect to overcome and trancend them?<br>
 <br>
yes you are right. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;	I feel that if you don't sacrifice just a bit of time in</i><br>
 forethought that the time will come when you can no longer paint those<br>
 paintings or rearrange those pixels.  A small sacrifice now may have an<br>
 avalanche of benefits later.<br>
 <br>
again you are right, of course... better work on that longevity thingy<br>
too....<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;P.S.-I hope you don't think that was hostile or such, I don't intend it</i><br>
 to be. I fully appreciated your response and respect it immensely.  <br>
 _______ &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I also respect   your ideas and wish for continued research into this area...<br>
<p>
I will try the GABA and anything else that can help the process.<br>
One thing i have often wondered about is the "iron brain" syndrome in<br>
olderpoeple, and the reverse correlation in artists, inventors, composers,<br>
writers etc to stay youthful in thier mind set even until the late nineties.<br>
Children have flexible neural nets - do artists also?<br>
One thing arts does for you is you are always confronted with the millions of<br>
choices - in each creation, what size, what medium? what colors? what shall<br>
we do? This line, that angle, what typefont? now with VRML its like... wow!<br>
Is there a link betweeen frequent choices and flexibility, the ability to<br>
"think on one's feet"?  New neural connectors being forged constantly...<br>
<p>
I think that the "bliss' of doing whatever work you do for the sheer love of<br>
it keeps the mind in a state of flux and pulse... <br>
<p>
Maybe investigating play and the responses of "letting go", having fun,<br>
whatever... would be a good place to start. <br>
