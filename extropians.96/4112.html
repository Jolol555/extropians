About 25 yrs ago, I was exposed to a machine called "Tach-X" that displayed<br>
a line at a time and covered up the words sequentially.  I got up to about<br>
550 by the end of the term (the only term, damn the public schools).  I've<br>
often wanted such a machine since.  Hm -- the only reference to an actual<br>
speed reading machine on AltaVista is to one at the Mark Twain Learning<br>
Center in Clayton, MO.<br>
<p>
I've seen recent demonstrations of by-hand speed-reading methods that<br>
have convinced me that a book can be gulped down at the rate of<br>
a page every second or two by an accomplished speed-reader.  I've<br>
resisted learning such techniques because I like to experience the sound<br>
and rhythm of the language as I read.  Now I realize that I can have two<br>
reading modes -- slow and fast.  Heck, if I can touch-type both QWERTY and<br>
Dvorak, I can do that.  Oh boy, another project!<br>
