<p>
Either that, or learn how to build fortresses. And I think most us prefer <br>
to avoid that. <br>
<p>
The big problem is that regardless of how good we are at memetic <br>
distribution, there will be differences that grow exponentially. What we <br>
truly need, is an ethics, a society, a system of being that can handle <br>
extreme differences between people - not just in wealth, but also in <br>
knowledge, goals and form of being. <br>
<p>
But spreading good memes are always a good idea. [Exercise for the <br>
reader: is this meme good?]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here is an idea. We should</i><br>
<i>&gt; list all the things (ie. trances) you can do by concentration and thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as techniques that make memes highly contageous (sp?) and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; create a meme such as the Gaia theory with an extropian twist to spread</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropianism like a religion across the globe. Could work!</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily as a religion (but Church of Virus is working on that),<br>
but as a good idea. I think the self-help memes could be combined and<br>
enhanced in some ways. <br>
<p>
A sketch of good "meat" for the meme:<br>
<p>
Creativity techniques (questioning assumptions, using random objects in <br>
new combinations, etc)<br>
<p>
The idea that you can control your mental state and growth (which is <br>
*very* subversive to many people)<br>
<p>
Mindmapping, mnemonics etc: "Our brains are trees or webs - use it!". <br>
<p>
A sketch of useful hooks:<br>
<p>
Good for you, will help you (we tend to do things that are good for us, <br>
and try to help our friends by giving them the idea)<br>
<p>
Cool (Some memes give social standing to those who follow them)<br>
<p>
Funny.<br>
<p>
Ideally, this meme or meme-complex should be compressed into a slogan, <br>
which can spread and open up minds to the main meme complex (a bit like <br>
how a virus enters a cell). <br>
