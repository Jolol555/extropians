Hmmmmmmmmmm. A drive, huh. Lets see. BUild a spherical spaceship, say,<br>
on the back side of the moon. Can't have any female technicians. Grow a<br>
skin on it that has the same high density of nerve tissue found in the<br>
male genitalia. If you turn off the nerves on one side, the ship will be<br>
attracted to the half of the females in the universe on the other side<br>
of the ship (actually all of them since the universe is a loop). Since<br>
the number of females in the universe is basically almost infinite, one<br>
would generate a HUGE amount of thrust, though probably limited by an<br>
inverse squared rule, but you could quickly reach near light speeds,<br>
achieving time dilation of like 1%, so you could travel hundreds, even<br>
thousands of light years in very little time.<br>
TANSTAAFL!!!<br>
