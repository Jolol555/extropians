<i>&gt;&gt;    Is anyone familiar with experimentation attempting to combine sensory</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; deprivation with other techniques (???) in order to give a feeling for </i><br>
what<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the upload experience might be like?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Read just about anything by John Lilly. "Programming &amp; Metaprogramming</i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Human Biocomputer". "The Scientist"...</i><br>

    Thanks, have his books on my shelves (read them too!), but my question<br>
was phrased poorly..."Is anyone familiar with somewhere I could physically<br>
transport myself to in order to *experience* (undoubtedly only one of many<br>
theoretical ideas of "what" the uploaded lifestyle would feel like) a type<br>
of "upload" consciousness?" I am referring to "shedding the body" (hence<br>
involving sensory deprivation to diminish sensory input), and using <br>
thought (?) to manipulate a "created" environment. <br>
    Hope this expresses my question.<br>
