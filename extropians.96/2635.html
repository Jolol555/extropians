<i>                &gt;what happens if you start two copies of Microsoft Word on                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;your computer. You have two identical programs both running                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;in the memory of your computer, quite possibly in exactly              </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the same state.   </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
If the two programs are in exactly the same state, then you are not running  <br>
two programs you are only running one program, you are just doing it in an  <br>
inefficient manner that will cut its speed in half. You are telling the  <br>
machine to make exactly the same calculation twice, but if you already know  <br>
the answer then it's pointless to calculate the same thing again.               <br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;how does your operating system tell the difference between                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;two copies of identical software in exactly the same state?                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;The answer is that every instance of Microsoft Word has an                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;externally identifiable signature that only has significance   </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to the operating system  and other programs. Note that the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;signature is based on spatial and physical properties of each                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;instance of Microsoft Word, since there is no other possible                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;way of distinguishing identical programs.[...] The signature   </i><br>
<i>                &gt;is essentially the "self-awareness" of the program.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
You're theory is that the space-time coordinates of a brain are important in  <br>
differentiating one consciousness from another, but I don't see how that  <br>
could be true. You argue that two identical brains somehow produce different  <br>
subjectivity because the brains are in different positions, but a brain <br>
without senses can't detect it's position. A brain can't detect time either,   <br>
I could speed up or slow down your brain as much as I wanted, I could even  <br>
stop it for a billion years and you would  never notice. A brain without   <br>
senses can't detect anything. <br>
<p>
Sensations can certainly change subjectivity, so the space-time position of  <br>
the sense input is of paramount importance, but the position of the <br>
information  processing machine is irrelevant. For most of human history <br>
people thought that the hart was the seat of consciousness and the brain just <br>
a minor organ to cool the blood, it didn't matter, those people were still <br>
conscious. The same is true for an Upload, he might not know or care where<br>
his brain was, it could be distributed in thousands of computers all over the <br>
planet. On the other hand, he would be very interested where and when his <br>
senses were.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;You could start and stop each instance of Word as many times                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;as you like and the signature, hence identity, would remain                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the same.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Then the two programs would no longer be identical.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;A program is deleted by changing or erasing this signature.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
And if I deleted my letter on one Word program but not the other, then my <br>
letter survives.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The point to all this is that even though your consciousness                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;"felt" the same after upload internally, external observers                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;would only recognize an equivalence, not a sameness. </i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
Well which is it? Before you said things would look the same to an external <br>
observer but not subjectively, now you say the opposite. If you felt like you   <br>
survived after the upload, what more do you need?<br>
<p>
I could be wrong but I think you would agree with me that the mind is what  <br>
the brain does. Playing music is what a phonograph does. If 2 phonographs are  <br>
synchronized and playing the same symphony and you destroy one machine,  <br>
the music does not stop. And it's real music not simulated music, just as a <br>
computer performs real arithmetic not simulated arithmetic.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;is it possible for it [consciousness] to exist in two places                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;at the same time?</i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
No, but then it's not even possible for consciousness to exist in one place <br>
at the same time because consciousness does not have a place because it is <br>
not a noun, it is an adjective.<br>
