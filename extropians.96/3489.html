<i>&gt;&gt; While the 2025 date may be effective for dramatic impact, I think there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is a lot of uncertainty over how quickly the various changes you predict</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; will actually occur.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Before the turn of the century, quite possibly, and I said so both in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;original article and in my Web page.</i><br>

Good idea! Perhaps aligning it with the 2000 meme might give it a increase<br>
in popularity because of the fact that many people believe something<br>
dramatically world altering will occur in 2000 but they don't know quite<br>
what as well as if we were able to figure out how to get to the moon in 1<br>
year and will be able to write 1cm x 1mm by this time next year we will be<br>
quite close to nano so it is a possibility with enough driving force behind it.<br>
