<i>&gt;I'd rather pay 10% more for recycled paper than to cut down 1000 year</i><br>

<i>&gt;(as it did in this lists's early days), so be it.</i><br>
On this instance I agree with him because I consider natural environments<br>
asthetically invaluable. There are many things in which humans haven't<br>
discovered or conquored yet and to see the engineering of the laws of<br>
physics and spontaneous orders in living animated examples is much better<br>
information quantity and quality than something generalized averaged and<br>
slapped in a book. Nature is a far better engineer than any of us. Nature<br>
engineers more complex and exotic stuff although much slower. We engineer<br>
quickly but bulky and we will eventually completely surpass nature's<br>
engineering strengths but not now. The reason nature is a greater engineer<br>
is because it looks at a problem in infinite directions. Human engineers<br>
look to accomplish a certain task with a few variables but nature looks at<br>
infinite variables. This doesn't mean I think environmentalism should be<br>
taken to it's extreme where an entire project must be stopped for a single<br>
animal such as the snail darter. If the snail darter was the only reason to<br>
stop the project, they should simply move it to another similar habitat.<br>
Again I must say...Arcologies! Either that or make a molecular map of the<br>
Earth by having nanites race through the planet and reporting back data.<br>
