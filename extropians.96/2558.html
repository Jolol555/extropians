Capitalist terms) is Theft.  If a mining company discovers, claims and mines a <br>
large seam of coal, then i believe that they have stolen it from me and by <br>
implication, the everybody else (aka The People)."<br>
<p>
I can see your point in cases involving natural resources, such as land and <br>
water and coal and mineral ores and so forth.  I can kind of agree that these <br>
should be considered to belong to everyone.  But when I create something of <br>
value with everyone's natural resources, what I create is mine.  My work is <br>
mine.  Sure, we all share mineral ores, but if I go through all the work of <br>
mining the ore and refining it and designing an automobile and building it, <br>
then the part of the car that I am responsible for creating is mine alone.  <br>
The materials that the car is made of may belong to everyone, and perhaps I <br>
should pay some small rent to everyone to use those materials, but no more <br>
than someone who has a big pile of unrefined ore in "their" backyard.  When I <br>
create useful objects, their utility is my creation, and I own that; the <br>
usefulness is something that I personally added; it is not the creation of <br>
everyone, and so it does not belong to everyone.<br>
<p>
Natural resources may belong to everyone, but the value added to the natural <br>
resources belongs to those who add that value.<br>
<p>
It is important that we interact with each other in ways which respect that.  <br>
Redistributing someone's work without their consent is theft.<br>
