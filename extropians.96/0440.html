Sex keeps popping up every few weeks, or so. By now it probably should be <br>

<i>&gt; discussion scores in the extropians mailing list.  I know these things are</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly nonlinear in time, yet it still unsettles me  somewhat...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If discussion of issues untechnical unsettles you, you could make a special,</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't unsettle me, only the complete absence of technically flavoured <br>
discussions does. It is a real pity the extropians policy keeps us from <br>
creating/accessing the former extropy archives. I think (no, I know) there <br>
is excellent technical material to be found there.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt; hitech,  &gt;Htech list. People have suggested specific lists for</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific-topics-only views. </i><br>
<p>
If we'd had 10k full-scale contributors, then this may be an option. As <br>
for now, this would mean splitting forces. I even think the simultaneous <br>
existance of the extropians and the transhuman mailing list to be <br>
overkill, though the amount of noise in extropians ML is higher (hint, <br>
hint).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;       NO NO - you missed my point, of course I meant it is strange that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole conference on consciousness ignored it's existence. </i><br>
<p>
Agreed. Maybe the topic was too complex. I'm not too sure where this <br>
consciousness hulabaloo came from at all -- it lacks solid wet neuro <br>
basis, imo.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, the hardwired "propagate, propagate, propagate" programme does </i><br>
<i>&gt;  often inhibit other functions, in humans mostly ratio. An (otherwise </i><br>
<i>&gt;  quite boring) </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      ( : - 0    You think sex is boring? Wow.sheesh, i have absolutely NO</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference point for that one.</i><br>
<p>
I never said such a thing. I said "otherwise quite boring". The act per <br>
se has no inherent attraction (if one thinks of it, no act ever <br>
inherently can). Should mutual nose picking or tennis playing result in <br>
offspring creation or high risk of death _and_ persist for several <br>
millenia, it sure would be equally emotionally loaded.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;physical act aquires a certain glorious aura, this also </i><br>
<i>&gt;  happens to the perception of mate/offspring. Remember the last endorphin </i><br>
<i>&gt;  high you rode when enamoured? Peek-a-boo -- ain't that one cute little </i><br>
<i>&gt;  dude?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Hmmm.......     I do not get the jist of the metaphor here. Our</i><br>
<p>
There is a strong emotional binding both to your mate and your child. A <br>
perceptional bias, a rose-coloured reality filter if you wish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; experiential referencing is too disparate. However I will point out that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing Transhumanists as immortalists, sex for the means of propagation is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the phenomenon I am referring to of course, but consciousness pleasure-</i><br>
<i>&gt;  including but not limited to -the endorphins, yes.</i><br>
<p>
If you are interested in pleasure -- after a substrate change the entire <br>
R&amp;P circuitry is open to you. Spending aeons in quivering pleasure or <br>
excruciating pain will be very easy, then. It is extremely <br>
straightforward to become a digital junkie (remember rat reward centre <br>
autoelectrostimulation experiments?). <br>
<p>
There are definitely grave dangers in running in a permanent wheel mode.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [and as Eric pointed out the experiental factor - interaction between two</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings on a very lovely level)</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, obviously sex expedites &lt;H evolution but that is not what we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing here -  I for one, see my own &gt;H future as being highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasurable as WELL as productive. </i><br>
<p>
The both do not need to be mutex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I want to soar in ecstasy as well as knowledge and creativity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The function itself is certainly ancient. Bacteria fuck (E.coli S+/-), </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; EEEK !!!!!! bacteria do WHAT? oh....ok, thats one way to put it (blush)</i><br>
<p>
sorry ;&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But do they enjoy it on a conscious level? Is that highly relative to</i><br>
<p>
It is difficult to talk about enjoyment while discussing such relatively <br>
primitive organisms. Nevertheless, there is no basic difference between <br>
what we &amp; bacteria do. Our act is just more complex, purists would say <br>
there is sufficient quantity delta to grant it the status of quality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; cognitive functions of the human brain?</i><br>
<p>
I doubt higher regions are too involved. It would be quite fascinating to <br>
do a PET/MEG imaging, while... erm.. in the act. I doubt such an <br>
experiment was ever undertaken, though. Science can be fun :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  [ subconscious olfactory behaviour determinant ]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No. Do tell! Olfactory means smells, the quckest way to the old brain, yes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; You must tell me more... </i><br>
<i>&gt; Smellipulation.</i><br>
<p>
There has been lots of discussion on human pheromones. This stuff is <br>
different, though (don't ask me for the original source, it was a Kraut <br>
paper article). Basically, it states women choose their mates by MHC <br>
fragment profile matching, unconsciously selecting for the most viable <br>
child (some olfactory data gets _never_ forwarded to "consciousness"). <br>
Interestingly, once in the pregnancy the preferences shift towards more <br>
related organisms, probably based on better kinship cooperation. <br>
Artificial progesteron analoga screw this up: the brain is tricked into <br>
believing a permanent pregnancy.<br>
<p>
This has definitive setbacks: the choice of your partner is modulated by <br>
the fact whether you take contraceptiva. Dropping the pill or starting <br>
taking it might result in a emotional partner reevaluation. Oh, yeah, we <br>
all are so very free indeed :(<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; As Anders has once said: why not wiring the reward centre to some other,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;constructive tasks? I hope I am not preaching askesis here, but devoting </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;an unnecessary amount of bandwidth + giving the subject much too much </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;glamour (highest bandwidth communication? Only as mb/s transfer rate </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is involved. The same 4 mbases every time, with negligeable alterations. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Boooring.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You find it boring?  And the same each time? ( scratching head) Well&lt; i had</i><br>
<p>
Well, boring from a information theory position. The material carrier for <br>
the information channel is packaged DNA, which is roughly 4 Gbases <br>
(sorry, I dropped 3 orders of magnitude in the last post) for us higher <br>
(?) primates. The stuff which actually codes is about 1 % (which can be <br>
still compressed quite nicely) of it, the rest is probably needed for <br>
packing (sticky patches for histones?) or are just runaway autoreplicators <br>
(these can be constructive for introducing mutation).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; to ask for this megabyte bit to be translated out of technospeak, but I get</i><br>
<p>
4 GigaBases. 4 billion bases. Apart from an occasional <br>
mutation/rearrangement the data set is basically the same. Highly <br>
repetitive messages en masse can get quite boring after a while, &lt;yawn&gt;.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; your jist - sex won't get us to the moon. Ok, so that is the reason why we</i><br>
<i>&gt; would not want to spend every minute of our lives on it</i><br>
<p>
Yeah.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Don't equate the glamour aspect with the pleasure aspect, or the marketing</i><br>
<i>&gt; value of sex with the actual function of it - not really purely biological,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but a happy addition to optimal lives ( since we are still talkng about human</i><br>
<p>
If happiness increases your fitness, it's okay. (Usually, it does, within <br>
limits).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; consciousness). Yes, it would be nice if " A not A " did give me a rosy</i><br>
<i>&gt; endorphin high, I would have probably spent a lot more time in calculus. </i><br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice to give you full control over what you like and what <br>
you don't? One can build safeguards, as limited duration or <br>
consensus/veto of clone history (chain of being, all alive) window.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However I think you are still underestimating the brain by giving it limits</i><br>
<i>&gt; on "bandwidth" that come anywhere NEAR to making it neccessary to eliminate</i><br>
<p>
A brain has a bandwidth all right. The raw sensorics bandwidth, the <br>
processing bandwidth, the memory bandwidth. Lots of bottlenecks, narrow &amp; <br>
narrower.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; sexual thought or pleasure stimuli in order to concentrate on technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; advances ( this would also mean we have to quit vacationing and  whole lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; wonderful and creative adventures).</i><br>
  <br>
I hope nobody's actually going to propose this? ('cause I would vote <br>
against, and STRONGLY so).<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Replication in a limited environment (solid state mind ecosphere) is </i><br>
<i>&gt;  bound to be limited (orelse we have to contemplate upon admitting the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Reaper in again, which imo is a Bad Idea), and, if not de novo would </i><br>
<i>&gt;  create a chimaeric structure from several contributors. You can wire your </i><br>
<i>&gt;  reward centre to it, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This lat was over my head, 'gene - What do you mean by replicating? AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-propagation? Your technospeak baffles me. Why must we then bring the</i><br>
<p>
Yes. ALifish autoreplication of bit pattern beings, whether artificial or <br>
natural (there ain't no difference, actually).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; reaper in?  Bandwidth again? What is a chimaeric structure?? Do you think in</i><br>
<p>
Should there be no built-in emergency exit from this universe, we would <br>
be stranded in this world. We would have to rely on whatever IT-capable <br>
material structures this universe allows for, solely. If true, we would <br>
run into limited resources (matter, energy) sooner or later. Once there, <br>
autoreplication has to stop, or we have to delete obsolete designs, <br>
taking over their IT resources. Hear the rattlin' of bones... If Darwin <br>
was with us right from the start, this state will be reached very soon <br>
(on cosmological time scale, that is) indeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; terms of hardware orgasms? BTW The reason age French used to call the orgasm</i><br>
<p>
"Hardware orgasms", what a nice term. I (very unscientifically) think <br>
every rational entity needs emotional "fuel" to make it tick. A purely <br>
rational being might have the status of a TV with a blown fuse. In fact, <br>
purely rational being might be an autocontradiction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; " le petit mort" ..."the little death"... refering to that  state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness of pure bliss, which gave one a temporary sense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "nothingness" - a sense of losing the self...which in humans probably</i><br>
<p>
Introspection capabilities of Self are quite limited. One needs an <br>
external (distinctly &gt;H) observer to actually record/evaluate what is <br>
going on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; facilitates that famous release from the tension - mental and physical, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; is one of the best effects of sex itself ..if one assumes the reward center</i><br>
<i>&gt; of AI would not need a break from it's busy calculations, nor be attuned to a</i><br>
<p>
A &gt;H being does not necessarily calculate (well, it does on the lower <br>
scale, but then we're not consciously pumping ions and burning ATP when <br>
we think, do we?). It can link the action "counting in Roman numerals" to <br>
its R&amp;W centre, which would make this boring action indistinguishable of <br>
sex (oh, yes, give me another number... hhah!).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; set of neural and muscular prompts - this could be seen as  a strictly</i><br>
<i>&gt; wetware debate perhaps. Hard to imagine uploads having ANY sex or gender</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway.</i><br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis sees is this way, too. Sexual specialization becomes <br>
unnecessary for a &gt;H individual.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but why bothering?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That brings up the "fundamental differences" topic again. Why indeed? ( BTW</i><br>
<i>&gt; If one doesnt *enjoy* sex, finds it boring or whatever then certainly one</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldnt do it). But more to the point:  What is one's reason for being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanist? If it is to enhance one's own existnce, then perhaps playing</i><br>
<p>
Perfectly irrational reasons, of course. To live on, to become a god, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; about with ways of enhanced pleasure, stimulation ie:  rewards ( as in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rewiring of pleasure to say, enhanced productivity - faster learning or</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever) will be desirable. Similarly if you only want to spend your time</i><br>
<i>&gt; and energy on technology and productivity, then  it is a waste of time.</i><br>
<p>
Whether it is a waste of time, or not depends on the evaluation metric <br>
definition utilized. My (purely subjective, of course) metric of success <br>
stems from the realm of Darwinian evolution: the ability to survive for a <br>
long time, the longer the better.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;           If one's goal is to bring on the Singularity, or to become an AI,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or simply think current humans won't actually be transhuman but should strive</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sacrifice this life to the common good then pleasure and good feeling ma</i><br>
<p>
I think UIF (at least what UIF means for me) forbids one from (strongly) <br>
manipulating others into state changes they don't want to do, unless this <br>
is absolutely inevitable for my own UIF. Prime Directive, and such ;)<br>
