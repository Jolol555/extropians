<i>&gt;&gt; From:	Jerry Herrington, INTERNET:jerry@avana.net</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; DATE:	10/27/96 10:19 PM</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; U.S. to Criminalize Trade in Vitamins</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In April this year Congress passed and the president signed into law the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Health Insurance Bill.</i><br>
<p>
Not true. The bill referred to here, H.R. 3103, the Health Insurance<br>
Portability Bill, became Public Law 104-191 on August 21, 1996. In April,<br>
the bill was still being debated, and considerable changes occurred to it<br>
prior to passage into law. "SPIRAL" who originated this message, has spread<br>
a grossly untrue and distorted message which has sidled me with the enormous<br>
burden of setting the record straight.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Unbeknown to most of us this bill contained what is termed a "rider"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which sneaked draconian measures past an unsuspecting public.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The rider was not from the FDA but from the United Nations World Health</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Organization Codex program.</i><br>
<p>
Not true! There was no such "Rider". HR 3103, as it was originally<br>
introduced, contained highly ambiguous fraud language that posed a threat to<br>
alternative medical practitioners, however this language was removed due to<br>
a major lobbying effort by Life Extension Foundation and numerous allies.<br>
The bill, as it passed, does not pose a threat to alternative medicine. In<br>
fact, by requiring insurance companies to reimburse for preexisting<br>
conditions, many feel that it HELPS alternative medicine because insurance<br>
companies are now beginning to reimburse for alternative treatments in an<br>
effort to keep costs down. An article of mine which discusses this in detail<br>
was just published in the December issue of Life Extension Magazine. It<br>
appears on p.40 of the December issue and is titled "Insurance Companies<br>
Reimburse for Alternative Medicine"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; These new provisions empower the FDA to close down all health food stores</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and to require that all of us obtain a medical doctor's prescription for </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; vitamins, herbs and other food supplements.</i><br>
<p>
There was no such "rider." This is simply not true! The German proposal<br>
currently before the Codex Alimentarius Commission IS a serious problem, but<br>
what is stated here about a "rider" connecting it to HR 3103 is simply not<br>
true! I recently returned from the Codex meeting in Bonn Germany, and wrote<br>
an article about the proceedings which I am sending in an attached file. The<br>
Codex threat to health freedom IS genuine, and I AM concerned about it, VERY<br>
concerned, but it hinders my efforts when people disseminate misinformation.<br>
Please help me in correcting this situation so that people will have an<br>
accurate understanding of what is going on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; SPIRAL, the Society for the Protection of Individual Rights and Liberties</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reports that the FDA is presently working on the implementation of this </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; new law. The "rider", which will likely cause the eventual closure of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; health food stores across the country, is part of the United Nations </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; W.H.O. Alimentarious Commission's program to control all food supplements</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; worldwide. Its provisions have already been imposed in Norway where </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; already half their health food stores have been forced to close.</i><br>
<p>
Can someone out there please tell me who runs "SPIRAL"? Can someone please<br>
give me a name, a phone number, an address? DAMN! I am pissed off. These<br>
people are either well meaning fools who have hoisted this crap up the<br>
flagpole without bothering to try to confirm it, or they are deliberately<br>
disseminating misinformation in an effort to screw up the health freedom<br>
movement. I sure do wish I knew who they were so I could try to determine which.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; UN provisions under the W.H.O. program declare amounts of Vitamin C in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; excess of 250 mg, for example, to be a drug. So don't be surprised to see </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the D.E.A. swat teams practising "dynamic entry techniques" in the middle </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of the night to seize your 1000 mg vitamin C capsules.</i><br>
<p>
There is an element of truth here, but the information as provided, is<br>
blatantly false and misleading. I am disgusted. <br>
