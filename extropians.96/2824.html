<i>&gt; &gt;Subject: Great Filter, Low Profile, Cryptocosmology</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;[...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If one looked at the inards of a very advanced computer, then if one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intercepted a "long" communications channel, where the cost to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;transmit was large compared to computation costs at either end, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;yes it should look like random noise relative to a high entropy state</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of that channel.  But this observation is a long way from showing that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the innards of this computer should look like the stars and dirt we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;see.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, right, that's even less than circumstantial.  Motive and method</i><br>
<i>&gt; are also needed.  I'm saying the motive is just that hiding is necessary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whether there's a possible method...because we're talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about civilizations more advanced than our own, we can only ask, can we</i><br>
<i>&gt; prove that it's *not* possible to be computing with (what looks like)</i><br>
<i>&gt; dirt?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By the way, in case I wasn't clear, it isn't that dirt, or any of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular surroundings, are what I would expect to see.  "Dirt" is just</i><br>
<i>&gt; my code word for whatever science would lead us to expect are natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; things to see at this stage in the evolution the universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If looking like "dirt" is a great advantage, and it's possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then I would expect advanced civilizations to look like dirt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As you point out, all that sunlight streaming away seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;inefficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.  But maybe that's just the cost of hiding.  Our civilization is</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly paying the same price without much complaining.  Or, and this</i><br>
<i>&gt; is something I've been thinking since, sunlight may be the dumping of</i><br>
<i>&gt; waste heat.  A little more on thermodynamics below.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'd expect an advanced computer to notice if some external force</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;started to muc[k] around with its innards, and to do something about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, "route around it," in John Gilmore's immortal words.  "To see</i><br>
<i>&gt; the internet in a grain of sand..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So if the world around us is an advanced computer, it knows about us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and chooses for some reason to allow our activities to continue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Either we are part of this computation, or it works around us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My assumption is that our activities are so gross and slow that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; pose no problem.  Even we humans know how to do distributed computing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; redundancy, moving running processes between processors, etc.  Anyway,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think we would be part of the computation, whether intended</i><br>
<i>&gt; or noise or bugs.  We don't seem much more troublesome than, let's say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; rainstorms, though.  How to compute with dirt seems much harder than,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Given I can compute with dirt, what if it gets up and walks?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;How much physics do you know Steve?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "...Clever people may learn as much as they wish of the results of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      science--still one will always notice in their conversation, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      expecially in their hypotheses, that they lack the scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;      spirit; they do not have that instinctive mistrust of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      aberrations of thought which through long training are deeply</i><br>
<i>&gt;      rooted in the soul of every scientific person.  They are content</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to find any hypothesis at all concerning some matter; then they</i><br>
<i>&gt;      are all fire and flame for it and think that is enough...  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;      something is unexplained, they grow hot over the first notion</i><br>
<i>&gt;      that comes into their heads and looks like an explanation..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;      --Neitzsche</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Say, college freshman level, polluted by popular accounts.  Including</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing my best to understand things like thermodynamics, information</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, and reversable and quantum computers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm not sure you realize how very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;much we do know about all that information streaming around us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, not enough, but tell me the fastest-reproducing human cell and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can compare it to a writable CD-ROM drive...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;We</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;know which systems are exchanging bits with each other, and how fast,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and where this arrangement changes, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wow, do we?  How does it compare to the computing cost of *simulating*</i><br>
<i>&gt; events at the quantum level, or even at the classical-physics level of,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, folding proteins?  I know no single number completes the picture--</i><br>
<i>&gt; my point is, it's the *amount* of interaction at various scales that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting, and I was under the impression that our computers have many</i><br>
<i>&gt; orders of magnitude to go before we even start to dent that.  Plus, our</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers are a pretty small fraction of the mass of the solar system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  We also know a lot about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;designing computers, carefully arranging the routes and speeds of bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;exchanges.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whoa.  Computers I know.  It is 1996 and almost all computers have single</i><br>
<i>&gt; processors with clocked logic.  One thing we know is that neither of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those design choices are necessary.  Sure, we know "a lot," but how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; do we know about what all computers *must* look like, under all design</i><br>
<i>&gt; constraints--especially the dirt constraint?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And these two really look nothing alike!  We can see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;nature's circuit diagram, even if we don't know what the bits</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"encode".  In particular, we can see the "short" communications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;channels, where we have no strong reason to expect noise-like bits.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless (sorry to repeat) it's strategically necessary to design things</i><br>
<i>&gt; that way.  It might be fun to try to come up with a method for designing</i><br>
<i>&gt; logic circuits where every signal looked as noisy as, say, a feedback</i><br>
<i>&gt; shift register.  By the way, it's looking natural that's the constraint,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not looking like noise.  Orderly or stereotyped patterns--say, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; recurrance of atoms in the periodic chart--are part of looking natural.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;optimum design for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I hope I've made my point that you have to look at the driving game</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, not just 20th century notions of computer design.  If hiding is</i><br>
an<br>
<i>&gt; absolute constraint, then efficiency is secondary.  If the most important</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure of "optimum" and "advanced" is whether something looks natural,</i><br>
<i>&gt; dirtlike, then whether it looks "crazy" is also secondary.  Heck, almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary.  Just look at the way bits flow through an encryption</i><br>
algorithm.<br>
<i>&gt; [I will not say, "Yeah, crazy like a fox!" as this would spoil the</i><br>
<i>&gt; paragraph.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the right point of view is to look at how much information</i><br>
<i>&gt; is sitting, colliding and moving free at each scale level, and then take</i><br>
<i>&gt; that as the given and design a computer and software (if the two must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguished) to make use of it.  When you're done you know how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; computing you can do--and you (the great intergalactic empire) live with</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  Them's the breaks, we can't compromise security.  In computing there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are often ways of making use of speed *or* storage space, according to</i><br>
<i>&gt; what's available.  Also ways of trading speed for thermodynamic</i><br>
efficiency.<br>
<i>&gt; I imagine aliens with billion-year patience would have extra slack here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are also strange tradeoffs in crypto.  Like Chaum's cash protocol</i><br>
<i>&gt; where you can spend money once anonymously, but if you spend it twice you</i><br>
<i>&gt; reveal yourself.  Imagining much more advanced crypto calls into question</i><br>
<i>&gt; what we know about the kinds of computing that need to be done, and also</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple game theory.  For instance, imagine it was possible to cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; something to happen, but not know where it happened.  What would that do</i><br>
<i>&gt; to notions of territory?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The thing I wanted to say about thermodynamics is that calculations of</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; kind of computing and communicating you can do depend on the background</i><br>
<i>&gt; noise, or temperature.  When trying to figure out how much computing dirt</i><br>
<i>&gt; or stellar plasma is doing, there is a problem: are those particle</i><br>
<i>&gt; motions really random?  To what extent?  If someone could throw off the</i><br>
<i>&gt; motions they didn't want and replace them with motions they intended,</i><br>
then<br>
<i>&gt; the effective temperature for the users and outside observers would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; different.  That would change how much computing would seem possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (The other cryptocosmology quip: "God is in the least significant bits.")</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know whether physics would let this kind of temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference exist for long, or at what cost.  Imagine (metaphorically)</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely cold parts moving extremely fast in an extremely well-designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine.  Does physics let you keep that up without friction "melting the</i><br>
<i>&gt; parts" quickly, even with refrigerators?  Even with, say, big systems in</i><br>
<i>&gt; known quantum states (setups too perfect for us to imagine making)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The sun's light might plausibly be refrigerating the sun.  Not so</i><br>
plausibly<br>
<i>&gt; the planets.  Of course sunlight can power planetary refrigerators, but</i><br>
so<br>
<i>&gt; few of those BTUs are falling on planets.  This really makes suns</i><br>
<i>&gt; look like the place to compute, except that plasma is even more unruly</i><br>
than<br>
<i>&gt; people (or is it?).  Maybe planets are very very slow mass storage, doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; processing only in order to store and retrieve and refresh.  But then</i><br>
there's<br>
<i>&gt; that nice single crystal of iron that forms the solid core of the</i><br>
earth...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Planets and suns both seem to have it over interstellar gas and dust</i><br>
because<br>
<i>&gt; they're compact, but considering what I said about speed/storage</i><br>
tradeoffs,<br>
<i>&gt; and also all that mysterious free-range sunlight, there could be</i><br>
something<br>
<i>&gt; going on there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If we want to think about advanced civilizations, I think we need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to recognize what a wildcard that "advanced" is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cryptocosmology says They might need to evade probes like science.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At best we can ask whether computing is possible in "dirt" *as we know</i><br>
it*.<br>
<i>&gt; If not, the Great Filter has more plausibility.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, there's a giant "OR...NOT" thrown into the picture, with no</i><br>
<i>&gt; probability assigned at this point, but it would make some questions</i><br>
<i>&gt; in crypto and game theory more interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
