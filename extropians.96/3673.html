I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the "Shooting room paradox" is<br>
missing some needed information.  There are one of three groups one can<br>
fall into:<br>
<p>
	1) You were in the room; the dice were rolled and it did NOT come up<br>
double-six... sorry, please try the roullette table.  Let's call this<br>
"population X"<br>
<p>
	2)You were in the room and double-six was rolled....you win!<br>
This is "population Y"<br>
<p>
	3)Double-six was rolled. The experiment ended but you had never been<br>
called..."population Z"<br>
<p>
hence:<br>
<p>
	probability of being in X + Probability of Being in Y + Probability of<br>
being in Z= 100%<br>
<p>
Let's look at Population Z.<br>
The probability of never having been called into the room ( as with the<br>
other two populations - X &amp; Y) depends on the total population available<br>
for the experiment.<br>
<p>
As the Total Available Population (TAP) approaches infinity, the chances<br>
of you, as an individual, being excluded from the experiment approaches <br>
certainty(?) and the chance of witnessing any roll... (whether a<br>
double-six winner or any losing combo) approaches zero.<br>
<p>
You need to know the number of people eligible for the experiment.<br>
<p>
The chances of double-six on any pending roll is 1 of 36.  The chances<br>
of you witnessing the roll depends on the general population.  However,<br>
if you feel you may get left out, you can always petition the<br>
government.  It is not fair that some of us get to see the tickled cubes<br>
while others have to put mind and muscle into play in order to create<br>
our own present and future.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the general principle I'm searching for is: The chances of an<br>
event happening and the chances of you witnessing it are two different<br>
things. Once the tree in the forest has 100% fallen, many, few, or none<br>
may hear the sound.<br>
<p>
Thankfully,the benefits of economics, technology and civilization<br>
*increase* as the the general population of free people goes up.  <br>
