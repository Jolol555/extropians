1. It may be that the LSD has no causal relation here. Many people<br>
gradually realise their conflicts as they grow older. It is also<br>
plausible that the LSD experience made some of this more visible, and<br>
therefore becomes blamed for this.<br>

2. Richard Yensen's masters thesis involved a group of persons given a<br>
full battery of psycholgical and intelligence tests  before and after<br>
being given MDA (a hallucinigen closely related to MDMA). The result was<br>
those who had the most and highest doses also showed the best<br>
improvements. All subjects had improved scores.<br>
