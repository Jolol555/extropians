I wrote, <br>
<i>&gt; Making sarin with diamondoid-based  assemblers is not going to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; any easier than making sarin with  biotechnology, or with </i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional chemical synthesis.  In fact it would be harder.  </i><br>
<p>
to which John Clark replied, <br>
<i>&gt; Not true, it would be much easier to make anything with Nanotechnology, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I gave my reasons as to exactly why it is easier in another post, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the one you found too boring to read.  </i><br>
<p>
This is very boring.  <br>
<p>
<p>
I wrote, <br>
<i>&gt; If somebody wants to claim that the diamondoid genie machine will </i><br>
<i>&gt; reprogram itself for free, so all you have to say is "I want a ton of sarin," </i><br>
<i>&gt; and presto, it appears... all I can say at this point is:  balderdash.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Designing and programming machinery to perform complex tasks </i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't going to get any easier in the 21st century.  It will always be a job </i><br>
<i>&gt; for experts.  Programming will not be free or instantaneous in the future </i><br>
<i>&gt; any more than it is now.  </i><br>
<p>
to which John Clark replied, <br>
<i>&gt; Agreed. Apparently that ["balderdash"] is all you can say.</i><br>
<p>
Note the expression, "at this point."  After writing approximately <br>
thirty posts on this subject, I think enough is enough.  I find myself <br>
in the odd position of trying to convince grown-ups that Santa Clause <br>
doesn't exist.  <br>
<p>
It's time to move on to other things.  I need to go out and propagate my <br>
own meme-set.  I mentioned some time ago that I am going to open an <br>
on-line university.  Philosophy will not be a separate subject; it will be <br>
integrated into all subjects.  The ideas I have introduced here (such as <br>
"calibration") will be used throughout the curriculum, along with other <br>
ideas (such as language reflection) that I have not mentioned on the list.  <br>
