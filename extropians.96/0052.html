I think so, but you have to temporarily leave the analytic/sceptic way of<br>
thinking. It is a great tool to use to orient oneself, but slightly<br>
limiting when you have set your course and want to DO it. Always finding<br>
new possibilities and evaluating them reduces our mental focus, sometimes<br>
we have to "be one" with the task, and just do it. <br>
<p>
I borrow mental tricks from various religions and ideologies, or make them<br>
up myself. For example, I have found that chanting a nonsense mantra is<br>
quite helpful to do some feats of strength or stamina. <br>
<p>
Another way would be to carefully think about your major goals in life,<br>
analyse how they can be achieved, think about what these subgoals mean and<br>
how they can be achieved, and so on until you see manageable tasks before<br>
you (today I'm going to read up on biochemistry so I can get closer to my<br>
exam so I can get my Ph.D in nanotechnology so I can help develop the<br>
nanomachines I need to become immortal). And this way you also *feel' that<br>
what you do moves you forward towards your great goals. <br>
