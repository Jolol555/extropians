HAHAHAHA. :)<br>

I was also considering a thought that many people who have bad genes offer<br>
other often spectacular genes such as is the case in Stephen Hawking. It's<br>
also interesting to note that Hawking's father was a researcher of tropical<br>
fatal illnesses which make me post the question, have we isolated a gene<br>
for Lou Gehrig's disease yet? or could there be some freak bacteria or<br>
virus running around that mutates and causes it just as there is a virus<br>
which causes some forms of cervical cancer. And you're right, all is<br>
natural there is no artificial.<br>
