<p>
How are corporations coercive again? Governments are fundamentally<br>
coercive, right down to their root. Big corporations usually avail<br>
themselves of government coercion (so does nearly everyone who<br>
votes), but I don't see any deep connection between the notion of<br>
a corporation and the use of force. A corporation is just a form<br>
of voluntary association.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then we see what social structures turn up. You say the natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship between humans is trade. I say it's cooperation. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think our ability to cooperate was vital to our evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; success. </i><br>
<p>
Where did you get the idea that trade is not a form of cooperation?<br>
I've got A and you've got B and I like B better than A and you like<br>
A better than B and so we trade, and both benefit. Win/win.<br>
Cooperation.  Human beings spent most of their evolution living in<br>
small tribes, cooperating with the members of their tribe and<br>
ignoring or competing with all other human beings. But we don't<br>
live in tribes anymore (or at least, we need to cooperate with more<br>
people than just the people we know personally). Trade is the method<br>
we've evolved for cooperating with all the other people in the<br>
world. Trade is a method of cooperation that you can use with people<br>
that you don't know well enough to trust to cooperate with in any<br>
other way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why do you equate the desire for a good life for all with central</i><br>
<i>&gt; planning. I hate and fear government just as much as you do. But I also</i><br>
<i>&gt; hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their</i><br>
<i>&gt; advertising and poison my water with their pollution. </i><br>
<p>
Desire for your own good life doesn't imply central planning, but<br>
desire for strangers to lead a good life (beyond simply attending<br>
to their desires, which is just trade) does imply central planning.<br>
It does so because desire for strangers to lead a good life (again,<br>
other than simply sometimes doing what they want you to do) implies<br>
that you can know what constitutes a good life for anyone other<br>
than yourself and those you know very well.  Lately, I have become<br>
convinced that it is impossible for me to know what constitutes a<br>
good life for anyone other than myself.<br>
<p>
As for lying advertising, I hate it too, but corporations are hardly<br>
the only ones who lie. Lying goes much deeper than such shallow<br>
and recently invented social structures.  The lying that you see<br>
emanating from corporations is, ultimately, committed by individuals<br>
within the corporations. It is so difficult to say, after all, what<br>
exactly honesty might mean as long as we still relegate the question<br>
"What is truth?" to the philosophers instead of trying hard to<br>
decide for ourselves. And also, I don't know about you, but I find<br>
that I have a very difficult time distinguishing between stupidity<br>
and lies. Left-anarchism isn't going to be able to magically do <br>
away with stupidity.<br>
<p>
And as for the water... did you actually experience corporate<br>
pollution in your water, and did you personally trace the causality<br>
behind that directly to some evil corporation, or is it possible<br>
that you are repeating things you've been told without thinking<br>
through all the reasons why you might have been told them?<br>
