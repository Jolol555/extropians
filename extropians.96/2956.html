Thanks Lyle for a good laugh this morning!  If it was my cow, it wouldn't be<br>
sacred.  It would be one of those bright colored ones who moos at the horizon.<br>
<p>
Seriously, why would you presume logic and reason about such issue to be a<br>
sacred cow?<br>
<p>
Personally, I have no evidence that God exists.  She hasn't spoken to me.  I<br>
haven't had a supernatural vision.  My greatest joys come from my own<br>
enjoyment of life, and my most welcomed accomplishments from my own<br>
endeavors. If someone or something is helping me along, deciding my fate, or<br>
causing some of those hard and rough times, then I agree with John Clark<br>
that she/he might take a communications course. <br>
<p>
The Churches of God and religious sects have a corner on the term God, so if<br>
_I_ am to invest in contemplating about a source of intelligence, such as a<br>
God, then it might be better for me to use a different term. <br>
