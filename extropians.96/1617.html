You are guilty of nothing. The extropians list is far older than the <br>
transhumanist list, and the two lists were started completely <br>
independently of one another, so there are no rules at all about which <br>
content is appropriate for which list.<br>
<p>
Extropians are a kind of transhumanist, so anything of general <br>
transhumanist interest would be of interest to both lists. You don't have <br>
to feel obliged to subscribe to both lists just because you're interested <br>
in reading one or the other of them.<br>
