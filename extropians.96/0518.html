I agree that it is important to think of what values or motivations SIs <br>
have, but they might be hard to code. I like David Brin's idea (in some <br>
of his short stories, like "Lungfish") that AI could be brought up a bit <br>
like human children and thus acquire human values. An AI living in the <br>
Net might have a very real chance of identifying with the struggle <br>
against net censorship (would limit it) and against Microsoft (might be <br>
incompatible to its inhomogenous distributed mind).<br>
<p>
It should be noted that most likely we will not see any classical <br>
man-SI conflict a la "The Forbin Project", but it will be completely <br>
different. After all, any SI could deduce that humans react irrationally <br>
to extortion. <br>
