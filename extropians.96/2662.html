<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Okay. Government regulation is "trying" to keep the businesses from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hurting the public. I think things like environmental regulations and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; health safety standards try, at least, to help the consumer. If there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; weren't any such regulations, companies could easily get away with doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dumping and selling hazardous products. Which they would. Companies are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; adept enough at manipulating media that they can paint a benevolent image</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of themselves with one hand and hurt people with the other. Nestle, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; example.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And government is the master at media manipulation. THey don't promise</i><br>
<i>&gt; they'll clean it up, they just want to LOOK like they are advocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulation that have the apparent purpose of makeing someone else clean</i><br>
<i>&gt; things up, when the reason things were dumped before was because</i><br>
<i>&gt; government gave them tax breaks to invest in certain industries, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; refused to build the waste disposal facilities that the businesses</i><br>
<i>&gt; needed to get rid of the waste. Sotring it was an OSHA health hazard, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; they had to get rid of it somewhere. Where they put is was not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments responsibility, so long as they didn't dump any where IN MY</i><br>
<i>&gt; BACKYARD.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
 The government was as short sighted as can be, as usual. But the <br>
businesses are still the ones who dumped the waste. The businesses made <br>
profit off the polluting industries, then, when told they had to take care <br>
of the harmful side effects. If the taxpayers gave these people money in <br>
order to make a profit (admittedly, jobs were created, but there is a <br>
better way than environmental degradation), then why should the taxpayers <br>
pay for the byproducts. It's like giving them money twice for them to <br>
make even more money.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Businesses are subsidized more than taxed. During Reagan's "regime", they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had a large tax cut for businesses, but the poor were still worse off than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; before.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Excuse me, but income taxes have gone down, and anyone in the US who</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes less than 20,000 dollars a year pays no net taxes at all, on</i><br>
<i>&gt; average. Business taxes have gone up, especially on small businesses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; typically owned by a husband and wife, employing less than 50 people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Big monopolistic, non-laissez faire corporations get all the tax breaks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
That I can believe. But as soon as a business gets powerful, the government <br>
accepts them as part of the elite, and gives them tax breaks. Taxes, <br>
however, do not generally starve people. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; THe Ogoni in Nigeria. Yet, because they have our economic support, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; don't need anybody else's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; IAN: Africa has followed socialism far far more than laissez</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; faire, yet you condemn laissez faire for the problems there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I can't thik of a single socialist government in Africa, especially not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nigeria. Nigeria is a fine capitalism, regardless of the military regime.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are obviously blind. Try Ethiopia, Botswana, Angola just to name a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few off the top of my head. Due to the long history of tribal tradition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; paternalistic, socialist regiemes experience high popularity.</i><br>
<p>
Angola is currently waging war against it's people. I don't know much <br>
about Botswana. Ethiopia is doing relatively well, if it wasn't dealing <br>
with internal breakup with Eritea. Tribalism would not lead to socialism, <br>
as least not the type you see. YOu might get socialism within a tribe, <br>
but a doubt tribalism would accede to a centralize socialist government. <br>
Which is a good thing.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; IAN: Socialism = universal social debt = totalitarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That's an excellent blanket statement, but not much logic behind it. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't see many socialist democracies having a much oppression.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Officially, no. Instead, dissidents are branded as lunatics. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; conception of reality does not concord with the official majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept of reality, them you must be insane (that is the accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of insanity). So consequently, you get "socialized", or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "helped", or "reeducated" or simply drugged and electroshocked "for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; own good".  See our way is so fine and good that you must agree that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are helping you get along. You do want to get along don't you..... Here</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the US, one is not "politically correct", or is a sexist, racist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; homophobe, "capitalist" (as if thats a bad thing), or baby seal killer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even though one is not any of those things.</i><br>
<p>
Do you have any evidence? I've talked to many people from those <br>
countries(Netherlands, other europeans countries like that) , even rabid <br>
skinheads from those places, and they don't compain of any ministry of <br>
truth. I don't hear any reports of the ministry of love coming to pick <br>
people up. This could be because I hang out on the wrong side of the net, <br>
but that's my experience. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They left the economy alone, which I think means laissez-faire in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; traditional sense. In fact, most of these geographic areas that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; considered "good investing", have a history of human rights violations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A bank teller tried to convince me to put my money in Latin America or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; South East Asia, two areas that haven't had the best track records for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Funny, huh.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; yeah funny like: Cuba, Sandinista Nicaragua, Totalitarian El Salvador,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Guatamala, and Chile. None of which are ( or were in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nicaragua), laissez faire economies</i><br>
<p>
El Salvador certainly was. If the U.S. hadn't pumped 6 billion into <br>
keeping the rich in power, there would be a popular government.  Chile was <br>
since pinochet came into power, but <br>
under the socialist democratic government, there weren't the same  blatant <br>
disregard for human rights. Nicaragua had a far better record for human <br>
rights under the Sandinistas than under Somoza. Guatamala is a U.S. <br>
puppet state, so companies like United Fruit can exploit the labour, <br>
prevent any attempt at social reform, and make more money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you're going to have capitalism, you're going to have government. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; still say we drop both of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What then? How are people going to live? Is everyone going to have their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own farm, their own factory that makes everything, and their own power</i><br>
<i>&gt; plant?  Granted, if (and thats still a big IF) nanotechnology fufills</i><br>
<i>&gt; its sci-fi promise, then we can each have all those things, and the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; two bases for trade will be information and relationships/entertainment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but that still requires free trade )i.e. laissez faire capitalism to</i><br>
<i>&gt; work for maximum benefit for all, but that is still at a very minimum</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20-50 years down the road. Don't hold your breath.</i><br>
<p>
You can still have trade. Under any system that allows it, people are going <br>
exchange stuff. It's when people who have capital dictate terms to those <br>
who don't that trade fails. Fair trade works, free trade doesn't,  Yes, I <br>
agree that people should take care of themselves <br>
first, but they shouldn't do it at the expense of other people. <br>
<p>
I would like people to become self-sufficient, but that's not going to <br>
happen anytime soon. Factories and farms are owned by the community, thus <br>
everybody gets a say on what activities the business is doing. No this is <br>
not state socialism. It's a business run democratically, so both the <br>
consumers and the workers have input, as to the residents of the area of <br>
the factory.  <br>
