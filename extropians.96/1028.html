<p>
I think there's a tension between what we believe through inference, and<br>
what we want to believe.  Political philosophies usually take a long time<br>
to play out; even afterwards there's often serious disagreement over what<br>
happened and why.<br>

<p>
Well, I was staking out a position.  More accurately, they are<br>
not-yet-substantiated claims.<br>
<p>
Robin, I suspect you would be a very formidable debating opponent.  I<br>
accept the challenge. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Consider an analogy with "computer science".  The vast majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"computer experts" most people meet or see have an agenda - they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;people selling you hardware, software, programming services, systems</i><br>
<i>&gt;with computer components, etc.   These people will usually say</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever it takes to make a sale.  But that doesn't mean there isn't a</i><br>
<i>&gt;community of people elsewhere doing careful computer research.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, people doing "careful" computer research often don't agree.<br>
(Check out the controversy over Qaulcomm's CDMA cellular telephone<br>
technology as reported (somewhat inaccurately) in the Sept. 6, 1996 issue<br>
of The Wall Street Journal.)  The difference is that in computer science,<br>
you can design objective and repeatable experiments.<br>
<p>
Most social science I have encountered focuses, by necessity, on<br>
observation.  While experimentation is sometimes employed, it's extremely<br>
difficult to limit the number of variables.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Similarly, most "social experts" most people see or meet are</i><br>
<i>&gt;representatives of some group with an agenda, pushing some political</i><br>
<i>&gt;position, selling some management consulting, etc.   But that doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean there isn't a community of people doing careful social research.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sure there's something to what you say.  Tell me more about "careful<br>
social research."<br>
