&lt;BTW, Eugene, I heard about a suggestion made a number of years ago, <br>

system is shaked into a random state and then allowed to settle into <br>
an attractor. Then an antihebbian learning rule is applied. When this <br>
process is repeated, it tends to eliminate spurious attractors, <br>
thereby increasing the storage capacity of the network from 0.138N to <br>
about .78N . Do you know whether this beautiful idea has been followed <br>
up?&gt;<br>
<p>
Excuse me (I'm not Eugene), and I have no recent knowledge about this, <br>
but a little history might be interesting.<br>
<p>
Perhaps you're not referring to anything so ancient as Francis Crick <br>
and Graeme Mitchison's early 80's work on dreaming and neural nets <br>
(e.g., 830714 Nature), but I believe these guys are the originators of <br>
the notions of fantasy, obsession and hallucination in neural nets. <br>
 'Fantasies' occur in neural nets when the net "knows too much and <br>
begins to relate everything to everything." 'Obsessions' occur when no <br>
matter what input you provide, the net responds with the same output. <br>
'Hallucinations' can happen in nets with feedback loops where they <br>
respond to inputs that would normally not provoke a response.<br>
<p>
As for 'unlearning', Hopfield and colleagues also looked at this way <br>
back when (e.g., same July 1983 issue of Nature mentioned above); so, <br>
there obviously has been much research since then, especially in <br>
neurophysiology circles (J. Allan Hobson, in particular, in regards to <br>
unlearning and dreams).<br>
