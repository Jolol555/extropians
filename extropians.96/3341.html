<i>&gt; &lt;So we arrive back at the Great Filter problem.  The dinosaurs lived on</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth for millions of years, but never evolved into tool-using creatures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Terence McKenna has suggested that when our ancestors discovered</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychedelic mushrooms, that stimulated them to start thinking, talking, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; using tools.  That was when they broke through the filter and started</i><br>
<i>&gt; making progress.  Without mushrooms, we could have been stuck in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary cul de sac for eons, like the dinosaurs.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't doubt that mushrooms and other natural nootropics helped; but, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; were would have been freely available to other creatures at the time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I have heard that these mushrooms thrive in cow dung, and humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly learned how to herd cows so that they might have had a monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the best mushroom supplies. Some species of insects, however, herd other</i><br>
<i>&gt; insects, and also use fungi as foodstuffs, or make honey (and perhaps other</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychotropic elixirs we are yet unaware of).  Why wouldn't having these</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar 'self-owned' resources, and the cyberorganization that cultivating</i><br>
<i>&gt; them brings, have raised their consciousness as well?  Anyway, I suspect</i><br>
<i>&gt; that any _Great Filter_ would likely be a complex mix of factors, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; than having one 'magical' ingredient.  No matter how self-directed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; creature becomes, it is still part of some larger system of resources and</i><br>
<i>&gt; restraints, and must adapt to that as well.</i><br>
