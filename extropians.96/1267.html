Below I demonstrate the utility of holistic identity in explaining<br>
and thus revealing the structure of the physical phenomena, including<br>
quantum phenomena of non/trans-locality.<br>

<i> &gt; Remember that your philosophy of holistic unity is in your own </i><br>
<i> &gt; head, and is not necessarily true about the world outside your head; </i><br>
<i> &gt; the world which is providing information to your senses is forever </i><br>
<i> &gt; beyond your direct reach (you don't see the world; you see the *effect* </i><br>
<i> &gt; the world has on you).  Your philosophy may make a great deal of logical </i><br>
<i> &gt; sense to you, but that doesn't mean that the real world categorizes things </i><br>
<i> &gt; the way you do.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: What your saying is the direct opposite of the reality. Aristotelian <br>
logic is how the mind categorizes the physical world -- into cleanly <br>
divided sets. In reality things are derived from relations that <br>
transcend our conceptually imposed boundaries. In reality things <br>
are all connected in a unifed continuum. Holistic identity relects<br>
this unified continuum.<br>
<p>
Ever heard of * relativity * ?  You may think that relational motion <br>
-- which is a relational identity -- is all in my head, but there is <br>
something out there called motion, and it, just like all identities, <br>
is derived from relation. What I introduce is a relativity of identity: <br>
A is derived and exists only in relation to ~A. Here's two physical <br>
points in space deomstrating relational identity / motion:<br>
<p>
A is in motion    A * ----&gt;  =  45 mph<br>
<p>
relative to       B *        =   0 mph<br>
<p>
The velocity / identity of A is derived from the relative identity of B.<br>
The identity of A is therefore a holistic derivative of the whole filed, <br>
and the identity of A contains the identity B, and vice versa -- their<br>
identity is unified -- for the following is also simultaneously true: <br>
<p>
B is in motion    A       *  =    0 mph<br>
<p>
relative to       B  &lt;--- *  =  -45 mph<br>
<p>
Free from relation to B, A has no velocity, and vice versa. Therefore<br>
the velocity-identity of A is null apart from relation and is therefore<br>
exclusively holistic. Quite clearly this is a property of the physical<br>
universe, not "my head" as you'd have as believe. And it's the constant<br>
logical structure of ALL identity, of ALL features of physical existence.<br>
<p>
                A = ( A + ~A )   or   A = 0<br>
<p>
Relation is real, it's no fantasy. It's the idea of nonrelational identity,<br>
to which you seem to adhere, that IS a fantasy because you cannot show a <br>
single example in the physical universe of it existing.<br>
<p>
If we stick to physical verification as the basis of belief, we are <br>
most sure to come to the truth. I can verify physically the relational<br>
nature of identity till the end of time. On the other hand, my opponents, <br>
most people, cannot even find a single example of a nonrelational thing. <br>
Does that stop them from believing in them? Not at all, because it's <br>
not how the brain categorizes information.<br>
<p>
If the physical universe is nonrelational, please show me an atomic<br>
particle with no external area. Please show me a state of motion<br>
with no symmetrical motion. Please show me a location that is a <br>
location free from external reference. Please show me left free<br>
from right, up free from down, fast free from slow, big free from <br>
small, bright free from dark,.... you can't do it. Clearly, the <br>
idea of nonrelational identity is the epitome of the absurd.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; [ lot's 'o personal stuff cut ] ..... nor do I think that your personal</i><br>
<i> &gt; philosophy of holistic unity is likely to be a feature of the real world.  </i><br>
<i> &gt; And even if it was, I don't see what value this way of looking at thing</i><br>
<i> &gt; actually has. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: So, according to you, even if it is true, we must ignore it.<br>
Geez. I'd say that attitude is an anathema to the highest goal of <br>
human inquiry -- the know the truth.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Does it help us understand the way our world works at all?  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: If everything is relative. Yes. Everything is relative, <br>
therefore it helps us understand the structure of our world.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Can it help us understand chemical reactions?  Can it help us build </i><br>
<i> &gt; better technologies?  Or is it simply a mental game with no external </i><br>
<i> &gt; relevance?</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I believe that it explains quantum phenomena such as quantum<br>
tunneling, instantaneous action at a distance, nonlocality of sub-<br>
atomic particles not under observation, multiple locations of a<br>
single subatomic particle. All these effects are, I believe, a <br>
logical expression of the fact that the identity/nature of a <br>
thing is actually non-local, is not other than the field itself.<br>
<p>
If the identity of a physical entity is nonlocal, as holistic <br>
identity dictiates, then these quantum phenomena are predictable.<br>
<p>
I cannot say what technologies if any might arise from knowledge<br>
of holistic identity, and I don't really care. My effort is to <br>
describe the nature of the objective universe, which is not <br>
always what mind imposes on it. The mind assumes identity<br>
is absolute but in fact it is relative. If holistic identity<br>
is the truth, then it should yield applications if not simply<br>
describe how and why things are the way the are.<br>
