<i>&gt; I apologize to this list for this discussion involving me getting so </i><br>
<i>&gt; far.  My original intention was to listen, then I responded to </i><br>
<i>&gt; something Eugene wrote without realizing that I was replying to this </i><br>
<i>&gt; list.  And now, I can only interpret this post by Rich as a continuing </i><br>
<i>&gt; attack on the social sciences that began on the transhumanist list </i><br>
<i>&gt; and has migrated to this list.</i><br>
<p>
There is no attack on the social sciences, Kathryn, at least not from me.<br>
I merely examine the scientific basis of various disciplines, and I am<br>
amply qualified to do that.  I do *not* delve into the social aspects,<br>
except inasmuch as time and again I have been saying that work in these<br>
areas is extremely valuable and *must* be done by these disciplines<br>
because it is outside of the scope of science to do it.<br>
<p>
So, where's the alleged attack?  All I see is *support*.  When I call a<br>
"social science" a social study and say it is *not* a science then I'm<br>
merely being precise with language and true to the procedures that underly<br>
the scientific method.  I'm not attacking the work you do, only ensuring<br>
that the label "science" is used correctly.  If you understood science as<br>
well as you do your own field then you would probably agree with me.<br>
<p>
Please try and see this thread in the constructive light in which it is<br>
intended.  It does nobody any good for a field of study to be mislabeled.<br>
<p>
Rich.<br>
