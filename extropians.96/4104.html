<i>&gt;I agree with Mr. Brin that it would probably be best for everyone if we could</i><br>
<i>&gt;all keep an eye on each other, so that we could especially watch those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a great deal of power, so that we can be aware if they are planning to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything dangerous to us, so that we can take action to stop them.  I sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;agree with his point that not having privacy is a good thing.</i><br>
<p>
To be precise, I distinguish between privacy (lower case), which is a<br>
dearly pleasant product of freedom and I refuse to do without, and Strong<br>
Privacy, which fundamentally implies secrecy, encryption and other methods<br>
to conceal information that others might have some reasonable desire to<br>
see. Of course there will be a fuzzy zone of overlap, which free citizens<br>
can and will argue about.<br>
<p>
Again, I am a moderate!  I only seem an extremist because the center of<br>
opinion in this debate is already so incredibly far tilted toward knee-jerk<br>
"Privacy"<br>
<p>
 However, what I<br>
<i>&gt;have not read from Mr. Brin is *how* we can realistically prevent people from</i><br>
<i>&gt;having high levels of privacy, especially the powerful.  How can we stop</i><br>
<i>&gt;people from using encryption?  The people who are conspiring against us are</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ones who will most desire privacy and secrecy, but I don't see any</i><br>
<i>&gt;realistic way of preventing them from attaining a sufficient level of secrecy</i><br>
<i>&gt;to keep their conspiracy private.</i><br>
<p>
I discuss this in my book.  It will partly be a cultural thing.  If people<br>
REALIZE that freedom is fundamentally based on accountability, there will<br>
be a general atmosphere of suspicion toward secrecy... and greater<br>
suspicion the more powerful the secret-keepier.  Note that the mighty emply<br>
flunkies, and those flunkies can blow whistles, leak documents, etc.  Mind<br>
you, THAT implies that it is our best interests to allow/encourage<br>
anonymous whistle blowing!  But Brin hates anonymity!  What's going on?<br>
<p>
Hey, I am a pragmatist and a moderate, not an ideologue.  The reason I push<br>
accountability is because it is what gave us this wonderful civilization.<br>
No other reason.<br>
<p>
Advanced encryption is profoundly difficult<br>
<i>&gt;to even detect or crack.  How do we stop the powerful from developing and</i><br>
<i>&gt;using such technologies?  How do we even know that they are using such</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies?  Sure, we can voluntarily refrain from keeping our own affairs</i><br>
<i>&gt;private, but how can we ensure that *everyone* does this?</i><br>
<p>
Almost everyone will, if it is considered rude and shameful and silly to be<br>
so paranoid, and if enough people get caught doing it and shamed.<br>
<p>
Face it, this is inevitable!  Try to picture a future society filled with<br>
mature, self-confident grownups with ambitions but nothing to hide.  Who's<br>
gonna skulk around encrypting then?  Silly paranoics, that's who.<br>
<p>
 Mr. Brin, are you<br>
<i>&gt;advocating *forcing* everyone to be public with every detail of their lives?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or are you just hoping that everyone will see the sense you argue in not</i><br>
<i>&gt;having too much privacy and willingly avoid being secretive?</i><br>
<p>
I answered this above.  In the short term, the paranoids and aynrandroids<br>
will win.  But if I am right, maturity will prevail in the long run.<br>
<p>
What about those<br>
<i>&gt;who have a real interest in keeping their affairs secret, such as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful?  What are you proposing to do about them?</i><br>
<p>
I propose continuing as we have.  Every year we demand more accountability<br>
from govt.  The movement goes in fits and starts re: aristo-oligarchy, but<br>
their corporations get more scrutiny each time they are caught doing shit.<br>
What people miss is that the trend I describe is already what America has<br>
been about for a very long time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mr. Brin, you preach the virtues of a society without privacy.  I would like</i><br>
<i>&gt;to hear your plans for actually implementing this idea.  It's one thing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;argue that your idea is a good idea, and it's quite another thing to actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;have concrete plans to implement the idea.  I don't see how your idea can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;implemented.  Do you?</i><br>
<p>
Thank you for the courteous and well-phrased questions.  If I had answers<br>
for every one, it would be a sure sign that I was an ideologue.  I'm not.<br>
Some suggestions etc can be found in my book manuscript.  At some point<br>
I'll be distributed a small number of copies for critique.<br>
<p>
Best wishes,<br>
