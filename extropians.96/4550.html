        Before I start, I'd just like to say that this post is not intended<br>
to offend any certain individuals.  Rather, it is about my perspective on<br>
bettering an already excellent forum for discussion.  <br>
<p>
        I've been on this mailing list since about mid-August...shortly<br>
after it became an 'open-forum'.  Therefore, I have little knowledge about<br>
how the extropian list was carried out before.  About two months ago, there<br>
was a lot of discussion over the possibilities of a two-tier list system for<br>
old and new extropians.  The thought was that there was a lot more noise<br>
than signal happening within the forum.  At that time, I disagreed,<br>
exercising my anti-elitist ideals, but now I believe that a two-tier list<br>
system would be quite beneficial.<br>
<p>
        I notice that within the past month, the signal:noise ratio seems to<br>
be getting quite lopsided in the (IMO) undesirable direction.  I might bring<br>
to mind the current debate on 'chain-letters' and radical and irrational<br>
(also IMO) reliances on the 'singularity' and 'semantical gender<br>
appropriation'.  Though these threads and concepts may mean a lot to some<br>
list members, I think the majority of the readers couldn't care less.  I<br>
realize that it is hard to define a border between extropian topics and<br>
non-extropian topics, but I'm beginning to see that it may be necessary.<br>
<p>
        The thought of a two-tier system has become slightly tempting to me<br>
as of late.  The method of incorporation is the mystery.  I believe it was<br>
Robin Hanson (forgive me if I am wrong, Robin) who developed the idea of<br>
having one list wholly open and the second list invitational.  Those on the<br>
second list would also be on the first, deciding upon well-versed posters to<br>
invite to the second list.  This method, of course, has a few bugs right off<br>
the bat.  The amount of mail for those on the second list would be over and<br>
above those on the first.  Perhaps the viewing of the first list could be<br>
optional?  Another forseeable problem is of how the selection would take<br>
place.  Perhaps a cross-section of 2nd list extropians could be used as a<br>
representational body to whom other 2nd listers make requests as to<br>
open-listers' potentials.  I apologize if that sounds too much like (dare I<br>
say it?) democracy.  As to who gets onto the 2nd list in the first place,<br>
that could be put to an open-list vote.<br>
<p>
       Perhaps there is no need for a second list; however, I have all too<br>
often seen newcomers asking old questions and starting stale threads.  Maybe<br>
there could be more emphasis in the exi-intro put on to reading the archives<br>
before posting.  This problem could be non-existant, but as far as I can<br>
tell, the more versed extropians (queue Max More, Natasha, Eric Watt Forste,<br>
Anders, TOMorrow, Eugene Leitl etc.) seem to be posting less, whereas newer<br>
and\or less versed extropians appear to dominate and initiate current<br>
threads (which I personally find more dry than in the past).  I'd love to<br>
hear other views and comments on these thoughts...be them opposing or agreeing.<br>
