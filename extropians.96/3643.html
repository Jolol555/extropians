<i>&gt;&gt; It seems to me that some people here want to become not so much Transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as non-human.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That may or may not be the case, depending on the individual.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing that is certain about a transhuman is that he or she or it will have</i><br>
<i>&gt;gone "beyond" their humanity in a few or in many ways.  To that smaller or</i><br>
<i>&gt;larger extent, they will indeed be non-human, by definition.</i><br>
<p>
Not if you understand what banjo meant by "non-human" (elaborated below),<br>
I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the other side of the coin is that unless the change has been 100% then</i><br>
<i>&gt;a degree of humanity will remain.  It's not black and white, but fuzzy.</i><br>
<p>
Certainly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The other thing that perhaps should be said is that to point a finger</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the non-human part of transhumans (frown implied) is rather speciest,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or at least indicates some intolerance for those transcending their human</i><br>
<i>&gt;limits.  That sits very poorly alongside the self-transformation and</i><br>
<i>&gt;acceptance of diversity that is at the very heart of transhumanism.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree strongly but I think the use of the word "human" is a large<br>
part of the problem.  You are using it in a sort of clinical, species-<br>
identifying way, where banjo is using it to mean the *best* qualities<br>
of humans.  I strongly don't want to live with extra-clever beings who<br>
have *rejected* what I consider the most important parts of humanity.<br>
I may "tolerate" them, in a wary way, if that day comes, but until then<br>
I'll try hard to convince people not to create them or become them.<br>
<p>
This is the main reason I'm an extropian: because the point is not just<br>
to celebrate change, any old change, but to try to make change for the<br>
better rather than the worse.  Extropy rather than entropy.<br>
