        Good post.  I personally have been toying around with the concept of<br>
'individuals together' for quite some time.  I think that it is one aspect<br>
of libertarianism that is often not considered on this list.  I agree with<br>
David's notion that many objectivists-&gt;extropians are taken aback by the<br>
thought of 'collective'.  Instantly, thoughts of 'self-sacrifice' and poverty<br>
(as opposed to sugar-plums) dance around in many of our heads at the mere<br>
sound of the word.  However, the way David (and most perceptual<br>
libertarians) see it is as a necessity to political and social<br>
individuality.  Oddly enough, the only way I can sum up my ideas on the<br>
matter is through one of my poems: "Bluntly"; especially in these lines:<br>
<p>
<p>
        So heart with heart<br>
        Hand in hand<br>
        Us two Gods<br>
        Shall shape this land<br>
        Separate as two<br>
        Together as one<br>
        Teach one another<br>
        Acceptation<br>
