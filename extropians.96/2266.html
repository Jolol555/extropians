This is extremely non-trivial biotechnology. It is far beyond even normal<br>
morphogenesis, since it requires not only self-reproduction and being<br>
immune-neutral, but also fast and reliable neural processing on a subcellular<br>
level to be able to mimic the neurons, a means of scanning the properties of<br>
a neuron, a way of replacing it while it is still working (neurons can extend<br>
their axons for a long distance, up to a meter; growth this far takes a lot<br>
of time!) and finally being able to interface with the outside world in an<br>
useful manner. <br>
<p>
Not impossible, but extremely hard (normal nanotech has the same problem <br>
in this scenario, but is at least smaller and doesn't require the same <br>
cytoplasmic machinery to reproduce and act). Using some kind of virus <br>
that rebuilds neurons from the inside might be possible. <br>

<p>
They are the non-firing cells that make up 90% of the brain mass. Some of <br>
them seem to give neurons nutrient and isolate them from each other. <br>
Others buffer their electrical activity, taking up ions and <br>
neurotransmittors. And some, the microglia, appear to work as immune <br>
cells, eating junk or damaged cells. There is plenty going on among the <br>
cells!<br>
