<i>&gt; Many people in the past have tried to tame the wildly spammed newsgroup</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.extropians in the past. Now that we realize that the audience is out</i><br>
<i>&gt; there, IT IS TIME TO ACT! *MANY* people are interested in these principles</i><br>
<i>&gt; and we *NEED* some type of public debating forum where we can bring the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian meme to the public rather than sit in isolation hiding in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; mailinglist. I will begin to post messages to alt.extropians and I *STRONGLY</i><br>
<i>&gt; URGE* you to do the same. EXTROPIANISM CAN DEBUNK ANY OTHER MEME ON THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; PLANET AND I WISH TO PROVE THAT FACT.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony to the opening of the *NEW* alt.extropians</i><br>

You _are_ new, and have not done your homework.  The Extropians<br>
mailing list has been advertised for 5 years in various media,<br>
including print venues such as *Wired* and major newspapers.<br>
We are not "hiding in our mailinglist".<br>
<p>
Realize that most unmoderated newsgroups are routinely<br>
"wildly spammed".  That's their nature: the net has not yet<br>
grown out of the "commons" mentality, and so, to paraphrase<br>
Dean Tribble, the newsgroups are the most vulnerable areas<br>
of "overgrazing".  No one owns alt.extropians.  Sometimes<br>
the grass grows tall, it gets eaten, the winds whip up and<br>
rip out the topsoil, and the land lies barren for a few years.<br>
Only the tracks of pickup trucks loaded with partying teenagers<br>
break up the sterile landscape...<br>
<p>
OK, a little over the top, I admit, but this is the regard<br>
in which I hold alt.extropians.<br>
<p>
Chris, also, note that posting as "Chris Hind" on this list<br>
and "an579689@anon.penet.fi (CiXeL)" is bad form.  You posted this:<br>

Welcome to the *NEW* alt.extropians where we will discuss breakthrough<br>
and currently theoretical technologies such as personality uploading,<br>
telepresence (those webblimps), manipulating global climate with<br>
technologies like HAARP, new breakthrough information such as the<br>
evidence of possible life on Mars and how it could've possibly been<br>
the source of all life in the solar system. I will begin a new thread<br>
every week and you are welcome to post and voice your opinion on the<br>
topic even if you're against what is being discussed.<br>
