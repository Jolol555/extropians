In that case, I suppose that evidence for language use among pongids and<br>
cetaceans would strengthen the argument for identifying the bulk of the<br>
Filter with the development of linguistic ability, would it not?<br>

<p>
One thing about birds is that they have wings, and so most of them have<br>
strong selective pressure favoring flight, which selects against large<br>
brains. Furthermore, having wings puts up a big barrier against the<br>
development of hands even among those birds that do not fly, and having<br>
hands seems to have something to do with being able to take advantage of<br>
language use in a takeoff of memetic technological evolution. These two<br>
factors might be enough to keep the birds "Filtered" out for at least a few<br>
million more years even if their brains have the same neurostructural basis<br>
necessary for the ultimate development of language use.<br>
<p>
But I have a basic problem with trying to pin the Filter on some internal<br>
development of the brain, which is that this will not even come close to<br>
closing the question until we have a significantly better understanding of<br>
the mind/brain than we do now, an understanding that is really nowhere in<br>
sight (though we've been making much faster progress in its vague direction<br>
over the last ten years or so than previously).<br>
<p>
Then again, the original objection, if I recall correctly, was that the<br>
various specialists in the study of each step were proposing plausible<br>
stories, making it seem likely that the Filter lies in our future. Since<br>
neuroscientists don't yet fully understand the workings of the mind/brain<br>
or of language use, they're the only ones whose stories we're not yet<br>
really able to judge the plausibility of. And that itself constitutes an<br>
argument for seeking the Filter in some yet unknown steps in<br>
neuropsychological evolution, if we hope to find it in our past.<br>
