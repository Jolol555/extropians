<p>
It seems to be a pretty good concept, and if Gary Hudson is working on<br>
it, then it must be feasible, though it has a major drawback:<br>
<p>
1) Using the reaction jet to move a rotor for greater efficiency is a<br>
bright idea, but it relies on the atmosphere as a working fluid, so once<br>
you get to an altitude where you can actually gain some speed, the air<br>
is so thin that you lose a lot of that efficiency.<br>
<p>
also 2) if the whole ship rotates, you've got major centrifugal<br>
problems, and if its a free spinning rotor, you've got major wear<br>
problems with the main bearings you are going to need, which adds up to<br>
big maintenance.<br>
<p>
Using my drive system, a launcher burning JP-4/LOX in a turbine motor<br>
would be directly linked to the Lorrey Drives for maximum efficiency and<br>
power. The internal working mass would be the same in every part of the<br>
flight envelope, so your would have the same efficiency.  Burning JP-4<br>
enables one to  hold the fuel in the wings, with LOX in the fuselage,<br>
and possibly some small turbofan engines for takeoff and landing burning<br>
air and JP-4 instead of LOX for more weight savings.  If you look up the<br>
Black Horse project or Pioneer Rocketplane for the type of vehicle I am<br>
talking about. They are using conventional rockets though, which is why<br>
they are only a suborbital sytem.<br>
<p>
This sort of launcher could take off from any 8,000 foot runway, with no<br>
in air refueling (as BH and PR talk about).<br>
