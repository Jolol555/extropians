<i>&gt; I think "subjective years" is a bad choice of terms.  It requires a</i><br>
<i>&gt; human-accessible definition.  From what I can tell, in a "subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; year" a given computing entity can do the same amount of computation</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a (an average? trained?) human could do in one calendar year.  Pick</i><br>
<i>&gt; a term more based in that objective measure.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks!  Suggestion incorporated.  Simultaneously avoids a confusing<br>
term and clarifies the model.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt; How can this be easy when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 11. Intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt; these are hard?  I find 11 pretty easy -- starting with chips that</i><br>
<i>&gt; connect to your brain and help you calculate or just give you more</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory, etc.</i><br>
<p>
To explain IA you need to dip into cognitive science.  To convey IA you<br>
need more text and attention than we're likely to have plus it's<br>
impossible anyway.<br>
<p>
To explain that IA is recursive, you just need to point out that IAs are<br>
better at coming up with new IAs.  This only takes a paragraph.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you can describe three factions, make this the middle one, so it</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets the memetic advantage neither of being first nor of being last.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Utopia, Doomsday, and Realism might be a good breakdown.</i><br>
Accepted.  Realism is identical with Utopia, so ... ;)  The only other<br>
faction I can think of offhand is the "ethical to the bitter end"<br>
faction, which says that the Powers will knock us off but that this is a<br>
good thing.  Moravec, for example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nope, sorry.  I'm an extropian and immortalist already, and _I'm_ not</i><br>
<i>&gt; convinced that uploading is all that attractive -- I _like_ having</i><br>
<i>&gt; a body.  Nanotech on the other hand I like.</i><br>
	You'll know better as a Power, so I won't bother persuading you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The people you're talking to are humans.  Most of them won't like the sound</i><br>
<i>&gt; of that one bit, not to mention that it will sound millenial/apocalylptic,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or like just another woo-woo "Strange Universe" segment.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, we need to avoid this as much as possible.  But the truth is that<br>
the Universe is strange, and the materialistic Utopias of nanotech<br>
invoke childish fantasies of omnipotence.  Do you have a practical<br>
suggestion for conveying the flavor of Beyond without running into those<br>
memes?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 10. Gray goo problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        It's not all roses.  The reader has a right to know, and again the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        threat of destroying the planet can grab the attention, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        not quite so much after all the false alarms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd leave this out of an introductory letter.  Alarmism is for missionaries.</i><br>
<p>
Amplify, please.  I'm not challenging you - I just don't understand. <br>
How does alarmism reduce the survival potential of a meme?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 13. Replacement of human society: End of History.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        The Singularity is not one of your petty memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thrillsville.  The end of history; just what I wanted.  Foo.  Show me</i><br>
<i>&gt; how it will be the beginning of a new, better history, and I might</i><br>
<i>&gt; want some.</i><br>
<p>
Translating to memetic terms, I think you're saying that this isn't as<br>
gripping as a bright new future that they can comprehend.  I do intend<br>
to try and - not so much make the Singularity comprehensible - convey<br>
the essential flavor and stud it with symbolic connections to previously<br>
present memes to make it stick.  Specifically, we might present the "new<br>
history" as a stepping-stone on the road to the Singularity; in fact,<br>
that's what I did.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 14. Singularity provides Interim Meaning of Life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        Ditto.  One of the ways to hook a meme in the mind is by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        making previously established memes dependent on it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to your Web page, the interim meaning of life is to get to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Singularity as soon as possible.  From your description, I'm in</i><br>
<i>&gt; no hurry.  Explain to people how their lives will be incredibly, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; unimaginably enriched, or this will not sound tempting.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  Add this to subject matter:<br>
"13.5: Singularity is a good thing."<br>
I tried to convey this with nanotech etc., but it may deserve its own<br>
paragraph before 14-Interim.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; 15. Summary: History is about to end.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        The meme as we want it to spread, once all symbolic groundwork</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        is laid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you aware of how easily this will get lost in the noise of crackpots</i><br>
<i>&gt; standing on streetcorners with "The End Is Near" signs as the Millenium</i><br>
<i>&gt; approaches?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  The Millenium has been remarkably quiet so far.  If we can get the<br>
Singularity published before any crackpots get started, there should be<br>
no interference until it's too late.  Did they get 2000 and the<br>
Greenhouse Effect confused?  Still, another note for memetic<br>
engineering:<br>
"Immunize against contamination from 2000 meme, explicitly or<br>
implicitly."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I DO NOT want a majority of the human race infected with a "History</i><br>
<i>&gt; is about to end" meme!  Singularity and nanotech would be completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; lost, and only the catch-phrase would remain, and it could be just</i><br>
<i>&gt; the thing to cause some nut, or some group of nuts, to try to wipe</i><br>
<i>&gt; out all humans ASAP.</i><br>
	So what's with all the constructive criticism?  Seriously, this is<br>
getting into a debate, but since you've challenged the project rather<br>
than the content, that's okay.  It's more a "technological progress is<br>
about to go over the deep end" thing.  Although the outline may read as<br>
apocalyptic, what we are attempting to convey is the "WHAM WHAM WHAM<br>
WHAM" flavor of the Singularity, in association with nanotech.<br>
	Bear in mind that memes have to spread.  The "End of History" meme has<br>
been around for awhile.  Without the Singularity and nanotech memes to<br>
support itself, it will remain silent.  I don't think we need to worry<br>
about the sting detaching itself from the bee and flying off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Incidentally, the Singularity page reads like a religious tract and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; math thesis mixed freely.  If that's what you want, great, but realize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that most people won't have the capacity, much less the attention span,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to read and understand it.</i><br>
All my favorite works read like that.  "Shadows of the Mind" and "Godel,<br>
Escher, Bach" come to mind.  Win or lose, you've still learned the math,<br>
and the math (and physics) in those works tend to be of vastly more<br>
learnable and powerful quality than those in pompous textbooks.  I shall<br>
nevertheless bear your words in mind when writing popular articles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose I could comment further, but I've spent too much time on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; already, and will probably just be denigrated for my trouble.</i><br>
How dare you challenge my ideas!  If I hadn't thought it was perfect, I<br>
wouldn't have posted PHBBTT HAHAHAHA.  Sorry, couldn't keep a straight<br>
face.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a long-time Libertarian Party member, multiple-time candidate for</i><br>
<i>&gt; office, technical writer, and budding student of social psychology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've had to deal with presenting (sometimes unpopular) ideas in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; palatable and clear way, and I draw on my experiences to try to save</i><br>
<i>&gt; you some frustration and disappointment.</i><br>
And I appreciate that.  But I do wish you would be a bit more specific.<br>
<p>
------ATTENTION READERS OF THIS THREAD------<br>
<p>
PLEASE POST YOUR OWN SUGGESTIONS FOR AN OUTLINE.<br>
<p>
This will allow us to mix and match the best features.<br>
My own outline isn't powerful enough, or diverse enough,<br>
to support a practical memetic engineering discussion.<br>
