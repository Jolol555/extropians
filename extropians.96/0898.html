I have noted something interesting in this thread, that we seem to assume<br>
that SI appears out of nowwhere in a vacuum. The archetypal scenario is the<br>
nanoworkstation at MIT that during the night transcends and takes of the<br>
world. <br>
<p>
In reality, it is very unlikey that we will get SI before merely HI and <br>
HI before subhuman intelligence. When the techniques for creating better <br>
and better minds appear, they will lead to a succession of better and <br>
better minds. This will also lead to a better and better understanding of <br>
the problems and risks of intelligence engineering; unless the growth is <br>
very fast and uncontrolled we will know about some of the dangers and <br>
possibilities. <br>
<p>
If we create SI, we will most likely have plenty of HI and &gt;HI, we will <br>
know what to expect. It should be noted that even SIs have limitations, <br>
and they won't be a single giant among lilliputs - there will be many <br>
human-sized beings to deal with, and armies of dog-sized beings, and <br>
trillions of lilliputs...<br>
