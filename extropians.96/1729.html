Anders Said:<br>
what I need is a <br>
quick overview of what frobnology is about). Maybe we need a special <br>
knowledge search engine that just looks at pages certified to contain <br>
useful information, not just advertisments or spam. <br>
<p>
I Say:<br>
Filtering rears its head again. I wish I could institute a site, <br>
cached in multiple places, that would serve as the micropaedia front <br>
door for a bunch of topics. Proxy servers can filter some stuff like <br>
banner ads out. But there's just too much stuff. I guess that's why <br>
agents seem attractive. I'd guess that auto agents plus humans is how <br>
Hotbot (or a better one) could be/is done--and it's still too often a <br>
haystack of irrelevancy.<br>
<p>
I *wish* for a Cliff's Notes (tm) on Everything. But _how_? :\ :)<br>
