<p>
I also agree that there is no point in elaborating the objective/subjective <br>
boundry, because I think the objective/subjective dichotomy is a ridiculous <br>
one to make.  In my arrogant opinion, everything is objective.  Even our <br>
thoughts are objective; they are actually happening.  My feelings are <br>
objective; I am actually feeling emotions.  That which we call our subjective <br>
experience is a *part* of the objective world, not something in *opposition* <br>
to the objective world.  The subjective is a subset of the objective; it's not <br>
the opposite of the objective.<br>
<p>
And this doesn't mean that objective reality is whatever we think it to be, <br>
but it does mean that our fantasies and imagination are objective, in the <br>
sense that they are actually occuring inside our own heads.  It doesn't mean <br>
that our fantasies and imaginations will actually have any _literal_ effect on <br>
the world beyond our bodies, unless we use our bodies to carry out our <br>
fantasies, by doing it ourself or communicating our ideas to others (machines <br>
or humans) who then carry out our fantasies for us.<br>
<p>
Again, the objective/subjective dichotomy is simply another invention of <br>
humans to irrationally place themselves in a realm outside the effects of the <br>
real world, to somehow separate themselves from objective reality.  It's <br>
amazing how stubborn that type of thinking is; it shows up all over the place, <br>
in many different disguises.<br>
<p>
Now, I'm not saying that there is no subjective world; there certainly is; <br>
there are many billions of subjective worlds; I'm only saying that the <br>
subjective is not located in any magical fairy land; it's in our own heads, <br>
and all our experiences are parts of a much vaster, objective world.<br>
<p>
The objective world is simply all that which exists, that which is actual.  <br>
Our subjective experiences exist; we are actually experiencing (in fact, this <br>
is all we really know for sure -- that we are experiencing; everything else is <br>
inferred from our experiences).  Therefore, our subjective experiences are <br>
part of the objective world, and for us they're the only part of the objective <br>
world that we really know about, for certain.<br>
