Or unless there are bugs in the Java verifier or runtime code (as there <br>

<p>
Actually, because I've written Java applets I do know this. I thought we <br>
were talking about applications, not applets. The original comment was about <br>
cross-platform apps, and said that because of verifiers the "security bugs <br>
that were neccesary to make the most powerful tools work that were initially <br>
closed will be opened and enhanced". Verifiers cannot reliably prevent you <br>
from downloading a Java app that erases your hard disk without bouncing any <br>
application that uses the I/O classes. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Java is a virtual world.</i><br>
<p>
Netscape is a virtual world that processes HTML files. That didn't stop <br>
people from creating URLs that executed host code inside Netscape and <br>
could have done anything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The bytecode verifier ensures that the Java</i><br>
<i>&gt; bytecodes stay within the virtual world.  There are no halting problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; here. </i><br>
<p>
Of course there is. You throw out any code that might break the security,<br>
even when it doesn't, *because* of the halting problem. Only simple code<br>
will pass the verifier. So you're limiting people's ability to write good,<br>
fast code in order to ensure that it's theoretically secure. If GNU come<br>
out with a super-duper highly-optimized free compiler which doesn't<br>
produce the same bytecode as Sun, then their applications will be bounced.<br>
<p>
More to the point, a 'secure' language should not need a verifier. The<br>
mere fact that Java bytecode must be verified before it's run shows that <br>
the bytecode is not secure!!! And you're right... it is *theoretically* <br>
secure. The problem, as I understand it, is that Sun chose not to write<br>
a secure interpreter with runtime verification of parameters because it<br>
would be extremely slow. So no matter how theoretically secure the<br>
bytecode definition is, Sun *chose not to create a secure implementation*,<br>
and rely entirely on the verifier to prevent abuse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In point of fact, if Java wasn't secure, *then* I could write a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Turing machine capable of solving the halting problem. </i><br>
<p>
Huh? Well go ahead, because plenty of security holes in Java have already <br>
been demonstrated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; flaws in the implementation,</i><br>
<p>
And how exactly do you prove there are no flaws in the implementation? <br>
Plenty have been found and exploited already, and more will be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but I think that your challenges here are</i><br>
<i>&gt; based on a lack of knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
Then you presume wrong. <br>
