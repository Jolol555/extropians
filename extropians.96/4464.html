<i>&gt; &gt; These arguments are not valid. Cryptography does not work this way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I'm trying to say is that when they recognize that someone is </i><br>
<i>&gt; using strong cryptography -- stronger than what most people</i><br>
<p>
The point is "recognition". The only way to recognize would to try, which <br>
would tie up M$ worth of special-purpose equipment for days, if not weeks, <br>
for the shortest of a single encrypted message. Considering current <br>
Internet traffic, that's impossible. Totally impossible. Even backdoors <br>
won't help, since the majority of the algorithms has not been developed <br>
by the NSA, and thus are unlikely to have obvious backdoors, or backdoors <br>
at all.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; generally use -- they will use *other* methods to investigate and</i><br>
<p>
There are no other methods. The only way to tell would to try. <br>
Steganography hides even high-entropy messages, making attempts entirely <br>
unworthwhile. This sample/picture contains contraband? Which bits? Which <br>
encryption methods? Aw shit, just a noisy picture. Was it really? Let's <br>
check again. Yechchchchchhhhh! (sound of hair roots deserting the scalp).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; find out what he's up to.  Cryptography can be supplemented by </i><br>
<i>&gt; plain old detective work.  </i><br>
<p>
Of course trashing, torture, surveillance and old-fashioned break-ins are <br>
much more effective than cryptoattacs. But it just prove my point: you <br>
can't apply these simultaneously upon the entire U.S. populace who are <br>
just using the Internet. There are even less resources for that there. It <br>
will certainly make the No Such Agency suddenly to become quite <br>
unpopular (for what's this is worth, NSA has certainly done it's part in <br>
protecting U.S.'s interests. Spooks be spooks, but at times one _needs_ <br>
spooks, whether federal, or private).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is quite impossible to tell random from pseudorandom, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is it impossible?  If that's a theorem, I would like to see the proof.    </i><br>
<p>
I can't think of a general one off-hand (entropy being observer-relative, <br>
maybe), one thing is trying to find the rule _and_ the contents of a CAM <br>
just by watching the generated sequence. It's impossible, without trying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway the problem here is not to distinguish random from </i><br>
<i>&gt; pseudorandom.  The problem is to distinguish among the many </i><br>
<i>&gt; different kinds of pseudorandomness.    </i><br>
<p>
There are oompteen tests for randomness. Good pseudorandom is <br>
indistinguishable from good true random, and you _can't derive any <br>
knowledge about the generating process_ if you just watch the stream <br>
(unless you watch it for an semi-eternity). Don't you get it? Consider <br>
reading some standard literature on cryptoattacks, these can't even be <br>
fully automated yet (unless you consider special cases as DSA). And good <br>
cryptoanalysts are rare and costly beasts indeed.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The only way to tell them apart would try a serious cryptoattack, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which is a very costly business.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So it's costly.  When the government feels seriously threatened,   </i><br>
<i>&gt; they will spend astonomical amounts of money to defend themselves.  </i><br>
<p>
Could they turn the entire solar system into a computer? The entire <br>
galaxy? The entire universe (fuck Einstein)? When I say astronomic, I really<br>
mean it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cryptography is now classified as munitions, and the NSA may emerge </i><br>
<i>&gt; as a branch of the military, with the same standing as the Army, Navy, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and Air Force, and with a comparable budget.   </i><br>
<p>
I know most mathematicians work for NSA, and that NSA buys more than half <br>
of the entire silicon output, _but that's not sufficient_. Or should they <br>
have mastered quantum computers by now, to better factor primes? A lot of <br>
cryptomethods do not rely on prime factoring. As in biological systems, <br>
diversity of cryptosystems is the best protection.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;: but the NSA could see the difference.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But not _casually_. That's the point.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is that the point?  There is nothing casual about this.  Recognizing </i><br>
<i>&gt; the various kinds of pseudorandom sequences produced by various </i><br>
<i>&gt; encryption schemes is not easy; neither is finding submarines in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; ocean.  But neither problem is impossible.  Suppose NSA has a budget </i><br>
<p>
In comparison to that, you already have found your submarines, without <br>
even looking. Human language has no comparatives to denote differences in <br>
these tasks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as big as the Navy's budget.  Then a lot of things become possible.  </i><br>
<p>
Like FTL? Attotechnology? Transcension? Spacetime engineering?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; It is true that universal encryption would make the NSA's task more </i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult.  Instead of using chips that make a simple distinction between </i><br>
<p>
That's an understatement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; low-entropy and high-entropy messages, they would have to </i><br>
<i>&gt; continually upgrade their chips to make more and more fine-grained </i><br>
<i>&gt; distinctions, and they would have to use other methods as well.  </i><br>
<p>
Please have at least a look at Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" to <br>
understand why no more and faster chips can possibly help.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;: Let me rephrase my original statement:  using more encryption than </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;: other people commonly use is like painting your windows black when </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;: everybody else uses curtains.  It just attracts attention.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; everybody using cryptography equals to anybody having windows. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is just some of them are bulletproof.  Really easy to tell, huh?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it is easy to tell.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  Shoot a bullet at the window.  If it breaks, it's not bulletproof.</i><br>
<p>
Imagine hiring 50% of the entire populace, equipping them with Uzi's and <br>
having a go at the housefront of the entire northern hemisphere. That's <br>
great fun. Oh yes, they might even find some bulletproof windows, as a <br>
side effect.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; 2.  Take pictures of all houses in the neighborhood with an </i><br>
<i>&gt;       infra-red camera.  Regular glass and bulletproof glass will show up </i><br>
<i>&gt;       differently in the pictures.</i><br>
<p>
As I said, the comparison was flawed. (Plain infrared won't help, btw). <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; 3.  Reflect a laser off all the windows in the neighborhood.  Different </i><br>
<i>&gt;       kinds of glass have different properties, and are identifiable. </i><br>
<p>
Nope, again. You'd need a spectrometer.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 4.  Ask the contractors who build houses -- who uses bulletproof glass?  </i><br>
<p>
You do, in a lazy afternood. Or John Doe. Or Foo Barsky. Or Mr. Everybody.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5.  Ask the company that makes bulletproof glass -- who buys it?  </i><br>
<p>
See above.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Anyway this analogy is not valid.  Everybody using cryptography </i><br>
<p>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; equals to everybody *covering* their windows.  It's just that some use</i><br>
<p>
No. If the matrix does it for you, _every_ single window is bulletproof. <br>
It is just that some of them are reinforced with an undetectable class <br>
4711 forcefield.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; more opaque coverings than others.  If there is a standard covering </i><br>
<i>&gt; that most people use, and somebody uses a different, more opaque </i><br>
<i>&gt; covering, that person has called attention to himself.  </i><br>
<p>
Please consider reading a basic book (e.g. Schneier's one) on <br>
cryptography. I am really not being sarcastic, but you must understand all <br>
the impacts of cryptography before you set out to critisize. Cryptography <br>
is really extremely basics: in two decades you'll find it in every (and I <br>
meant it) intelligent household appliance (and by then virtually every <br>
household appliance will be intelligent). E.g. digicash and digital <br>
signatures (to name the most trivial commodities) are impossible without <br>
cryptography.<br>
