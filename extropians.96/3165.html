<p>
An inaccurate statement Lyle. It may separate you from many Extropians, but<br>
not from all Extropians. In my own writings, such as "Transhumanism: Towards<br>
a Futurist Philosophy" -- even though it was written over six years ago when<br>
lingering personal anger towards religion remained -- you will find a<br>
recognition of the positive side of religion. Speaking for myself (though<br>
also, I believe, for some percentage of other Extropians) I do not hold<br>
"religion" in contempt as a whole, since religion includes several strands<br>
and is hard to pin down exactly.<br>
<p>
What I do despise in religions: Blind faith, self-sacrifice, dogmatism,<br>
debasement of the real world and the physical realm and elevation of a<br>
mythical other-realm.<br>
<p>
What I respect in religions: Attempts to make sense of our place and purpose<br>
in life; attempts to discover a code of values to live by.<br>
<p>
What I understand and sympathize with but disagree with: A belief in an<br>
afterlife, with certain behaviors increasing your chances of making it<br>
there. I find this an understandable rationalization in the face of<br>
extinction. For most of history, when there was zero chance of truly<br>
overcoming death, falling into this rationalization was very easy. Today, I<br>
think some cryonicists overestimate their chances of successful suspension<br>
and revival for the same reasons (ditto some of those who seem to be certain<br>
that they will live long enough to be uploaded). [I wrote about this in the<br>
context of a *rational* dynamic optimism in my "Dyamic Optimism" in Extropy #8.)<br>
<p>
So, Lyle, please be more careful in how you characterize Extropian's views<br>
on religions. We don't all agree. And some of us find *some* value in<br>
religions. They contain (mostly primitive) philosophy and psychology, an<br>
attempt at values sometimes conducive to successful living (even<br>
Christianity, hideous though I find it in many ways, contains important<br>
moral lessons), and an attempt to increase the meaningfulness of our lives.<br>
Their problems mostly derive from people dogmatically sticking with beliefs<br>
that might have been vaguely believable a couple of thousand years ago in<br>
the face of massive evidence and better ideas.<br>
