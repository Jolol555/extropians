I was involved in a lengthy discussion many years ago regarding whether or<br>
not a god could die, which led to a discussion of what type of space a god<br>
resides in.  We came to some conclusions which I still hold today and I will<br>
attempt to share and explain.<br>
<p>
<p>
A deity's existence and mortality depends wholely upon human consciousness.<br>
This could explain the lack of physical evidence for the existence of<br>
deities, but it does not automatically exclude the influence of a deity as a<br>
separate and real entity.  <br>
<p>
A deity exists as the net sum of the total consciousness of those that are<br>
followers of that deity.  Much like an ant colony, religions do not have any<br>
central intelligence from which influence is derived, but a distributed<br>
intelligence and consciousness scattered throughout its members.  The highly<br>
developed nature of many religions is an indicator of how evolved this<br>
distributed consciousness is.  In virtually all non-cultish religions,<br>
tremendous influence is exerted by the deity without requiring a single<br>
human consciousness to coordinate and force the exertion of this influence.<br>
The influence exerted is distributed throughout the followers, potentially<br>
to a huge net effect, without necessarily any personal gain for any<br>
individual, but huge gain for influence of the deity involved.  This<br>
apparent third person direction of influence is the crux of deitic<br>
existence.  And I believe that you can logically address this apparent<br>
deitic entity as though it were a god/entity (although without all the<br>
powers normally associated with a god).<br>
<p>
The fact that a deity can effectively die is evidence of this.  Consider<br>
some of the ancient powerful gods like Dagon, Marduk, et al.  At times in<br>
history, these deities exerted enormous amounts of influence on<br>
civilizations, but today they do not exist other than as historical<br>
references.  They have no followers, hence no group consciousness, hence no<br>
influence.  Because these gods can exert no influence, they are dead.  Just<br>
the opposite can be said of some modern gods.  Some modern religions can<br>
exert *phenomenal* (god-like?) amounts of influence upon society and the<br>
world due to enormous followings and highly evolved group consciousnesses.<br>
<p>
<p>
When I look at these ideas today, it now becomes clear that deities are<br>
actually complex, highly evolved, virulent memes.  The fact that so many<br>
gods have died throughout the history of man proves just how mortal *any*<br>
god is.  This would also imply that *any* meme can achieve deitic status if<br>
it evolves to a certain level and in certain directions.  A deity can be<br>
killed, but this requires killing a meme which has evolved extensive<br>
defenses against eradication.<br>
<p>
On a side note, I wonder how hard it would be to artificially construct a<br>
true deitic meme?  We talk about memetic engineering, but constructing a<br>
meme of this complexity and power would require significant thought and<br>
intelligence.  Most religious memes seem to evolve as offspring from older<br>
now dead religious memes.<br>
