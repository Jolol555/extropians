Actually, it was seriously explosive. An enclosed spoonful or so (I don't<br>
know the exact amount since a friend with a death wish did the actual<br>
mixing) was enough to blow a coconut and a silly hat into oblivion, and<br>
leave a one meter wide crater in packed soil. <br>

<p>
Well, the idea was to use the catalytic reaction between the manganese <br>
dioxide and the chlorate that releases oxygen; I guessed it would make <br>
the otherwise strong magnesium-chlorate reaction stronger. In retrospect, <br>
I doubt that was the real reaction, but the combination was definitely <br>
powerful. And it made me nervous, I have never liked chlorates...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) Replace magnesium with aluminum.  A little harder to ignite, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; significantly boosts the thermal output.</i><br>
<p>
One fun experiment we did (it was a young scientist association in <br>
southern Stockholm) was to make thermite using copper oxides. It managed <br>
to vaporize coke cans quite nicely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Replace potassium chlorate with sulfur.  Aluminum/Sulfur mixtures make</i><br>
<i>&gt; good high-temp sub-igniters and have better thermal characteristics than</i><br>
<i>&gt; potassium chlorate/magnesium mixtures.  It is also more stable.</i><br>
<p>
The residue also reacts with water to form hydrogen sulfide, which may or <br>
may not be a fun side effect. <br>
<p>
Ah, the reckless days of highschool. I still remember when one experiment<br>
blew up, set fire to a small field of grass and rained metal pieces over a<br>
large area. The police arrived, only to find a group of youngsters in<br>
white lab coats carrying electric gear and gas masks (another of my<br>
less-than-safe inventions: yellow cadmium fog) arguing about how much zinc<br>
there ought to have been in the mixture. They just looked pained when we<br>
started to explain :-)<br>
