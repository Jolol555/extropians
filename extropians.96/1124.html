<p>
IAN: I doubt over 100 people were wishing just before they saw <br>
the missile-like object that "I hope I am going to see a missile <br>
blow up a plane."  If they were thinking this, then and only then <br>
could we assume that it may have been a group hallucination stimulated <br>
by wishful thinking.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Besides, you can't believe everything you read in the newspapers or </i><br>
<i> &gt; see on TV.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Funny, when I question what the media says, people say that's nuts.<br>
Perhaps we can only qestion the media when they conflict with the govt. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The same Associated Press cites a report there was a meaningful blip *and*</i><br>
<i> &gt; an anonymous report that it was concluded to be a spurious signal.  Which</i><br>
<i> &gt; should we believe?   The conclusion it was spurious was later included in </i><br>
<i> &gt; a formal statement -- subjecting it to broader public scrutiny.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I believe that the radar operator saw something, something that<br>
coincided with the witness of over 100 people. Why should these <br>
pentagon officials wish to remain secret? Sounds like they may have <br>
feared that their name would be tarnished in the future if it ever<br>
gets out that it was a military "snafu" and they were covering<br>
it up. It's very curious. There's something they feared.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; No, what you are really suggesting is a conspiracy between the entire</i><br>
<i> &gt; government and the entire media to cover up the "truth."  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: I never suggested the media was covering up anything regarding, <br>
this matter, I even used media reports as the only basis for considering <br>
a missile. It's strange how whenever someone questions the govt-line<br>
regarding events, instantly people think one supports every known<br>
conspiracy theory. <br>
<p>
However, the media's complicity in covering up govt misconduct <br>
is overwhelming. Waco is a case with dozens of proofs of this. The <br>
media is often the original source of info, which then never becomes<br>
part of the final story. With rare exceptins, the media's final story <br>
is almost always the govt's final story. The book VOTESCAM provides <br>
overwhelming evidence/proof of media/govt conspiracy. <br>
<p>
It's a shocking book. You can get a copy of VOTESCAM via:<br>

<i> &gt;We agree on the form of truth.  What we disagree over is your belief that</i><br>
<i> &gt;only a handful of conspiracy theorists have access to its substance.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I never said anything remotely akin to "only a handful of conspiracy<br>
theorists have access to its substance" ?? I simply spoke about the <br>
statements made in the press clipping I sighted. People make claims <br>
and we judge them on a case by case basis.<br>
