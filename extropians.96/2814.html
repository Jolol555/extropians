I did hear that the FBI examined Salinger's papers, and announced that<br>
they were the same one's publihsed over the internet which were<br>
"discounted" already in the investigation.<br>
<p>
Question: If they were discounted, why did a Secret Service Agent give<br>
these to him now, when they are apparently worthless. Perhaps they were<br>
not and this person was trying to get some one who had experience in the<br>
WHite House operations to see that maybe they were not fake. I would<br>
like to see an invenstigation of the investigation. <br>
<p>
If you recall, this is the same thing the FBI said about the "shoot to<br>
kill" orders they gave agents at Ruby Ridge. The truth eventually came<br>
out in the end there, and showed that the FBI is a lying pack of dogs.<br>
