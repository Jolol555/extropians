Max More:<br>
<i>&gt; I think there are ways of achieving extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus, but I seriously doubt that believing in a God helps much. When the</i><br>
<i>&gt; runner said "the first person I want to thank is God", she was simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpreting her victory in terms of her religious beliefs. She didn't see</i><br>
<i>&gt; how utterly absurd this was (why should God favor her?). The fact that she</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpreted the result that way is not evidence that her belief helped her</i><br>
<i>&gt; win. How would her belief help? If she believes her winning is inevitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; because God is on her side, she might actually train less hard. Someone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; believes it's up to them, and believes that they *can* win through maximum</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort, seems to have a better chance (other things being equal).</i><br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
But apparently they didn't, since she went ahead and won the race,<br>
despite<br>
this limitation you would claim she had.  So, either:<br>
	a) she was lying, and doesn't really believe God had anything to<br>
		do with it.  or<br>
	b) her competitors were also depending on "God's grace" and <br>
		didn't get it.  or<br>
	c) her competitors were rational thinkers with high motivation,<br>
		but just happened to be lousy runners.  or<br>
	d) a mix of b &amp; c.  or<br>
	e) she somehow found a compatibility between her belief in God and<br>
		the drive to do the work it takes to win an olympic medal.<br>
<p>
Maybe the Believer has stronger motivation when doing it for God<br>
(who is flawless and radiant and created the universe and all of that), <br>
than the one who is doing it for his or herself (who takes a crap <br>
every day, had acne as a kid, etc).<br>
<p>
My point is that that certainty and determination have to come from <br>
somewhere, and must be intense to survive through the years of<br>
training.  Pure love of the activity is probably the greatest reason<br>
for having the drive to excel in it, no matter whether one wants to <br>
thank a mystical being for it or not.<br>
<p>
BTW, I don't know what Donovan Bailey (Canadian 100m world record guy)<br>
used <br>
for motivation, but hot damn, how about that look on his face after the <br>
race?!<br>
