<i>&gt;&gt; Some of the symptoms I had were zero short term memory </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (forget trying to follow a movie), feeling like I was going to pass out, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; my entire body going cold, and a terror that I had somehow </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; damaged my brain and perminantly altered my perception </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; into a paranoid losing touch with reality when I knew that it was only </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a little dose of THC. I had tried weed quite a few times before </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but that was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;AFAIK, synthetic THC isn't on the market.  It would be ridiculously </i><br>
<i>&gt;expensive.  When a dealer sells you "THC" it's really something else, </i><br>
<i>&gt;usually PCP.  </i><br>
<p>
Uhhh, no I was just talking about strong weed.<br>
