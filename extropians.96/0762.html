 If the SI is a recent upload, that will almost certainly be true,<br>
but what if, as Drexler suggests, the SI's evolve because someone<br>
throughs enough computing power at it to repeat the processes by which<br>
intelligence evolved on earth. Then the SI's will be part of a society<br>
and an ecosystem that evolved with them, and the additional society<br>
that they could find in the external world wouldn't necessarily be any<br>
more valuable to them than Africa or China are to most of us.<br>
