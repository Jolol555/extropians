        by Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
        Former presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George <br>
        Bush stood shoulder to shoulder in a joint letter stating <br>
        that they ``categorically oppose'' access to cannabis <br>
        medical therapies for the ill, which will become legal <br>
        in California if Proposition 215 passes and in Arizona <br>
        if Proposition 200 passes there. [1]<br>
<p>
        Even as cannabis has been found to be ``probably the <br>
        most potent anti-epileptic known to medicine today [2],'' <br>
        according to Dr. Van Sim, and even as it has been found <br>
        to stop epileptic seizures in children not responding <br>
        to legal drug therapies [3], these former presidents <br>
        fear that medical access would send the message to <br>
        children, true as it may be, that cannabis is safe.<br>
<p>
        Our compassionate former presidents would rather send <br>
        the message to children that allowing epileptic chil- <br>
        dren to suffer seizures is safe; that allowing glaucoma <br>
        patients to go blind is safe; that throwing sick people <br>
        into dungeons is safe; that relocating peaceful portions <br>
        of the population into labor camps, dubbed "boot camps," <br>
        is safe;  that the proliferation of prisons and police-<br>
        state powers to advance a pogrom of prosecution upon <br>
        peaceful people is safe. In short, our former presi- <br>
        dents wish to send the message to children that  <br>
        a future of police-state fascism is safe.<br>
<p>
        Cannabis kills zero people every year, yet over the <br>
        last bloody century, police-state fascism, in the <br>
        advance of various police-state pogroms designed to <br>
        persecute peaceful people, has led to the mass murder <br>
        of millions upon millions. Now, here in the U.S., not <br>
        only are nonviolent drug users being relocated into <br>
        prison labor camps, but even leaders of the Drug War<br>
        have called for the systematic extermination of non-<br>
        violent drug users. For example, former Los Angeles <br>
        Police Chief Daryl Gates, who founded the anti-drug<br>
        program D.A.R.E., which is taught in schools across<br>
        the nation, stated in September of 1990 that "Casual<br>
        drug users ought to be taken out and shot." [4] <br>
<p>
        Let us turn our back on police-state brutality and <br>
        let us instead take a stand for the sick, for medical <br>
        freedom of choice, alas for the future of freedom itself. <br>
        Let us just say no to police-state fascism and yes to <br>
        healing and hope. Hear the cry for freedom and justice: <br>
<p>
        California: vote YES on Proposition 215. <br>
        Arizona:    vote YES on Proposition 200.<br>
