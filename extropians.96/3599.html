This just amazes me. Chris, apparently you don't you have any idea what<br>
Extropy Institute has done to disseminate and develop these ideas! That's<br>
understandable, given that you haven't been around long and only read this<br>
list, and don't get Extropy and are not a member of Extropy Institute.<br>
(E-mail lists, by their nature, are not places where things get done.)<br>
What's puzzling is why you don't do your research before repeatedly<br>
complaining that no one is doing anything. Actually many people are doing<br>
things in various ways, both inside and outside ExI. <br>
<p>
Why not learn about what has been done, and then see how you might further<br>
the advances already made? Extropy Institute has the contacts and the<br>
reputation to make the job of spreading ideas easier. If more high energy<br>
people like yourself would work with us instead of spending so much time on<br>
the list saying that no one is doing anything, we would get more done.<br>
<p>
For a start, why not come to the ExI-LA dinner meeting this Wednesday?<br>
You're not far away.<br>
