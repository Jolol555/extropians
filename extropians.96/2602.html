I passed this thought along to Greg Egan, who commented as follows (I quote<br>
with his permission):<br>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
I thought about the "quantity of dust" issue a bit more after I finished<br>
the book, and I can't see how (if the "dust theory" is true at<br>
all) you could tell the difference between a universe ultimately made of<br>
just two distinguishable "pieces of dust" called "1" and "0", which are<br>
"recycled" (i.e. perceived to be arranged in patterns like 1001001110, when<br>
there's really only one of each "in existence") ... and a universe with a<br>
certain larger but finite quantity of "1"s and "0"s.  To be finite or not<br>
is a property of the way you *use* the dust -- of the upper-level laws of<br>
physics.  So our universe could be a closed, finite universe, and the<br>
Permutation City universe could grow forever ... and *both* could simply be<br>
different rearrangements of the same two pieces of dust.<br>
<p>
I suppose that's really just Platonic materialism -- but I don't think<br>
there's a choice between that, and a finite supply of dust you can run out of<br>
(against your own laws of physics).  I think the dust theory implies<br>
arbitrary freedom to recycle, so the notion of "quantity of dust" is<br>
meaningless, so for economy's sake we should say there's just a single "0"<br>
and a single "1".<br>
