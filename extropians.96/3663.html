In the "End of the Future" book they discuss a probability paradox which<br>
I hadn't seen before.  As often happens with these thought experiments,<br>
they describe it in violent terms where people get shot (hence the title),<br>
but I will change it to a less bloodthirsty version.<br>
<p>
The details of the numbers below are not important, so I will just pick<br>
some to give an example.<br>
<p>
Ten people are selected at random and brought into a room.  There,<br>
two dice are fairly rolled.  If they roll double sixes, which should<br>
happen one time in 36, the people in the room get a reward and the<br>
experiment ends.<br>
<p>
If some other number is rolled, the people leave the room and the process<br>
is repeated, except this time 10 times as many people are brought in.<br>
We brought in 10 people the first time, so now we bring in 100 people.<br>
We repeat the dice roll.  If we get double six, we give out the reward<br>
and the experiment ends; otherwise we choose a new group of people,<br>
10 times more numerous, or 1000 people in this case.<br>
<p>
We keep this up until we give out the reward, choosing 10 times more<br>
people each time we fail.  (Assume the population from which to choose<br>
is infinite so we will never run out of people.)  Then the experiment<br>
is over.<br>
<p>
Now, the question is, suppose that you find yourself selected as one of<br>
the subjects in the experiment and you are brought into the room.  You<br>
watch as the dice are rolled.  What should you expect to see?  With<br>
what probability will you expect the dice to come up double sixes?<br>
<p>
By normal reasoning, you would expect the probability to be 1/36.  The<br>
dice are rolled fairly and nothing should diverge them from this result.<br>
<p>
However there is another argument which suggests that the chances are<br>
much higher.  The idea is that approximately 90% of the people who ever<br>
go into that room are going to see the dice roll as double sixes.  That<br>
is because we keep increasing the number of people after each failure,<br>
so that when we do get a success the number of people who see that will<br>
considerably outnumber all of the people who saw failures.<br>
<p>
Since 90% of the people who go into the room see double sixes, it follows<br>
that if you are a person in the room, the chances that you will see double<br>
sixes is 90%, far greater than the 1/36 chance we calculated before.<br>
<p>
This represents a sort of reverse causality where events in the future<br>
can in effect influence the probability of events in the past.  It relates<br>
to the issue of whether our existence here and now is influenced by the<br>
size of the human race in the far future.<br>
<p>
My personal opinion is that a random person in the room actually would<br>
see the dice roll as sixes, and that if I found myself in the room I<br>
would bet on the double sixes if someone offered me this option.  What<br>
do you think?<br>
