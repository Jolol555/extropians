<i>&gt;I, too, cannot see huge differences between UIF and DIF, except that the</i><br>

<i>&gt;universe in a self-deterministic way. It's a very subtle, and perhaps purely</i><br>
<i>&gt;semantic disctinction, but a very important one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For me, transhumanism (and, hence, Extropianism) is about both the</i><br>
<i>&gt;realization of potential and, inspirationally, the transcending of that</i><br>
<i>&gt;initial potential: in essence, being all that one can be and more (no pun</i><br>
<i>&gt;intended). And DIF is a clear expression of that, more so that UIF, because</i><br>
<i>&gt;of DIF's intrinsic references to self-determinism, interaction and flexibility.</i><br>
<p>
The subtle distinction that you refer to is an important one.  I don't know<br>
how UIF was approached by others in this regard, but for me this has been a<br>
chief concern.  I stated months ago that I thought UIF was, perhaps, sloopy<br>
in its authorship.  It's original purpose, so to speak, was mutated.  Thus,<br>
my intent was to drop UIF and develop another way of viewing my individual<br>
freedoms.<br>
<p>
Rich added much to the phrase, carefully developing his view of its purpose,<br>
and Peter and Greg also did much work on it.  To my knowledge there was much<br>
disagreement regarding its objectivity and/or subjectivity.  This was a<br>
problem for me, thus my continued search for a phrase that I could identify<br>
with because I found myself somewhere between their views - but leaning more<br>
towards Peter and Greg's summation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Natasha More:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'd rather start fresh and be sure from the beginning that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;when I speak of my unlimited freedoms...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't believe one can talk of unlimited freedoms, only self-limited</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedoms, and DIF incorporates that idea of flexible self-limitation.</i><br>
<p>
This could be one of the underlying ideas to explore.  At first glance it<br>
makes sense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Natasha More:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I seek a phrase that sees freedom as more objective...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any objective definition of freedom (by which I mean one upon which all can</i><br>
<i>&gt;agree) must allow for the subjective realization of that freedom: that is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it must express freedom as a concept of sufficient flexibility to assimilate</i><br>
<i>&gt;and implement the personal desires of all its proponents, as individuals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The 'dynamism' of DIF allows for this, in my opinion: it encompasses the</i><br>
<i>&gt;flexibility of self-determination and self-realization required for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;generally acceptable definition of freedom.</i><br>
<p>
"More" objective - not totaly objective.  Now, this begins to get to a root.<br>
While Rich would like UIF to be 100% subjective, Peter sees it differently.<br>
I am not a subjectivist, so for me it cannot be 100% subjective.  Again,<br>
this was not _the_ issue when the UIF phrase came into existence, but later<br>
as many people started exploring the concept.  I lost interest with UIF<br>
because of this.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;by concentrating on the dynamism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;we may be able to avoid the misinterpretations of "unlimited" that those</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not too well acquainted with UIF have occasionally made.</i><br>
<p>
I thought the misinterpretations were with people who had very carefully<br>
debated the issue.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Richard Artym:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Furthermore, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;this is a pearl beyond price, by pointing out the DYNAMISM of this freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it becomes inescapable that limits to individual freedom cannot be set in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a priori manner through jurisdictional restraint.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In a way yes. Although I think it would be more accurate to say that by</i><br>
<i>&gt;pointing out the dynamism of this freedom it becomes inescapable that limits</i><br>
<i>&gt;to individual freedom can be set through jurisdictional restraint only for</i><br>
<i>&gt;those individuals who choose to respect that jurisdictional restraint. And</i><br>
<i>&gt;further, the dynamism of those individuals means they remain free to change</i><br>
<i>&gt;their minds and cease to respect the restraint. Perhaps this is another</i><br>
<i>&gt;subtle difference from UIF: DIF doesn't place the same opprobrium on those</i><br>
<i>&gt;who choose to allow others to restrict their freedom, because the dynamism</i><br>
<i>&gt;overtly recognizes that that acceptance is transient, and hence DIF is never</i><br>
<i>&gt;abbrogated.</i><br>
<p>
Ok.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I hope the above discussion gives some idea of my reason for selecting DIF</i><br>
<i>&gt;as my 'chosen freedom '. I'd be extremenly interested to hear other views on</i><br>
<i>&gt;this interpretation.</i><br>
<p>
Good work.  Now, I'll have to think about my 'chosen freedom' some more and<br>
see what I can come up with.  <br>
