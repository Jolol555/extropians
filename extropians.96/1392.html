<i>&gt; Maybe we can test this out. To me, the web is approaching the point now</i><br>
<i>&gt; where you propose nanotechnology will be. The means of production isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps free but it's pretty low considering you get worldwide distribution.</i><br>
<p>
Although there is danger in reasoning from analogy, at first glance your<br>
analogy with the Web looks interesting.  Unfortunately, it seems to fall<br>
apart under a little more examination, as follows.<br>
<p>
First of all, the web allows goods to be created at zero cost in the web<br>
information space (you can make your HTML twice as long without additional<br>
cost, usually), so that would appear to be a point of congruence in the<br>
analogy with MNT.  Unfortunately, the new goods created do not provide<br>
for subsistence of their creator, who will still have to pay his or her<br>
ISP and still have to earn a living to pay for food and shelter, so the<br>
analogy doesn't hold there.  After all, MNT is predicted even in the<br>
tamer predictions to create food on demand (just recycled biosphere) and<br>
to manipulate the geology just as effectively, so shelter too is free.<br>
(The Earth has a negligible population density, but it's just too costly<br>
and hard on people at present for a planetary mini-diaspora to occur.)<br>
<p>
Secondly, and more importantly, you can create web goods at zero cost,<br>
but you cannot create their means of production, ie. the tools that<br>
create web spaces and networks and computers *cannot* be created by the<br>
web weaver.  Consequently, there is no congruence with MNT here at all.<br>
<p>
The latter is the big issue.  When a single person without any special<br>
resources can create what today is a mammoth work of civil engineering<br>
(my favourite example of the seawater pipeline to the nearest ocean)<br>
then all bets are off as to the structure of economic institutions.<br>
<p>
It's this business of creating the *means of production* at the point of<br>
need (eg. only the leading edge of the pipeline may contain a "factory")<br>
that I keep on trying to point out as being so crucial, because that is<br>
the key difference with today's manufacturing as far as economics is<br>
concerned.  Merely producing cheaper goods (even *zero-cost* goods) is<br>
really just an evolutionary change, because today's factories would still<br>
be required and people would still have to pay for the privilege of<br>
owning their product.  That equation undergoes a discontinuity when<br>
the means of production themselves can also be nanoconstructed out of<br>
the surrounding biosphere and geology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it's an economy of abundance, but the marketing types are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking in terms of an economics of scarcity.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's a good point.  I can't figure out why they don't make the<br>
mental switch though, when it's so clear that major changes are in the<br>
making.  I suspect that it's going to take a lot of knocking our heads<br>
against brick walls before it's accepted as "obvious".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does it make sense to compare a near-future information-based economy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a later-future nanotech economy?</i><br>
<p>
Within limits, possibly.  The analogy doesn't carry over well into the<br>
most important expected area of impact of MNT though.<br>
