<i>&gt; construction of railroads did.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Robin Hanson and I are discussing roughly this same idea in another<br>
thread. the essence of my argument is that, while the "laws of<br>
economics" don't  change, their applicability may. In particular,<br>
economics depends on the concept of a transaction. the parties to the<br>
transaction must decide to make a trade. The desision to trade depends<br>
on the relative diverence in utility of the goods (or whatever) being<br>
exchanged to the parties. If neither party hase somethoing the other<br>
wants, then there is no trade and no economic activity. (Sorry for the<br>
kindergarten-level explanation. I'm not an economist, so I need to<br>
explain my assumptions since they may be wrong.)<br>

With MNT, it will be a lot easier for an individual to produce an<br>
item than it is now. This means that an individual is less likely to<br>
trade for the item. An individual will be able to produce essentially<br>
everything needed for a lavish lifestyle, with none of the costs<br>
associated with trade. This will reduce the amount of trade drastically.<br>
Essentially, when the cost of individual manufacture<br>
drops below the costs (hassle, time, and transportation) associated<br>
with trade, trade will cease.<br>
<p>
It's quite possible that a new  econoimy will develop based on a new<br>
set of scacity, of matter, energy, or design. However, MNT has<br>
the potential to develop very rapidly, destroyingthe existing<br>
economy before the new one develops.<br>

<i>&gt; If you assert that Genies will exist, then that would imply a change</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the economic system.  Genies amount to the same thing as slaves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a slave-based economy does differ from a capitalist economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But even postulating Genies does not change the laws of economics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A slave-based economy follows the same economic laws that apply</i><br>
<i>&gt; in any other economy.</i><br>
