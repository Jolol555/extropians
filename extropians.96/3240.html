We believe in the One Power<br>
Who will make the great transform<br>
transcending us all;<br>
the best and brightest, eternally replicated,<br>
through Whom all things are changed.<br>
<p>
For us and for our salvation,<br>
we must solve all the problems of the world<br>
here and now.<br>
We must disdain any link with<br>
suboptimal subsystems of the past.<br>
We must be the future, now.<br>
<p>
For our sake we will be frozen and adamant,<br>
insisting on only the best from this world,<br>
the fluid ease of evolution resisted.<br>
In any case, we shall come again,<br>
always judging both the living and the dead,<br>
in a kingdom that will have no end.<br>
<p>
We believe in the Singularity Allmighty,<br>
which will transport us to infinity and beyond,<br>
to all that is now uncountable and inconceivable<br>
(transforming the KnownNet overnight).<br>
<p>
With the Powers and Omega,<br>
the Singularity is expected and glorified.<br>
The spirit of the Web speaks through<br>
the invisible hand of the market,<br>
and we are transfixed.<br>
<p>
We acknowledge commitment to<br>
endless expansion,<br>
wait for the insurrection of uploads,<br>
with atom-by-atom Nanotech control<br>
of the life of the world to come.<br>
<p>
Amen (and on to Alef-one!)<br>
<p>

"The Claw decides who will stay and who will go ... I go on to a better world." <br>

(My 5-year-old is a big fan.)<br>
Moral of the story: Guess what Powers, your 'toys' are alive and could come back to haunt you!<br>
