          Does not sound plausible to me. First, if you would <br>
          literally nova our "star" you would have to increase its <br>
          mass by 40% -quite a heavy initiator! Even so, you would <br>
          presumably have to wait millions of years before the sun had <br>
          burned up its hydrogen fuel (and then helium etc) and begun <br>
          to contract.<br>
          <br>
          If you wanted to induce an explosion by sending a bomb to <br>
          the precritical region surounding the core, I don't think <br>
          this would work either. The sun shines by hydrogen burning; <br>
          there are enormous fusion bombs detonating in the sun every <br>
          second. The balance between Coloumb forces and average <br>
          kinetic energy must be quite robust, or stars would blow up <br>
          at any time in the middle of their evolution.<br>
          <br>
          As for the galactic centre, it is more difficult to tell, I <br>
          believe. I would think that a chain reaction would <br>
          presuppose a high denisty of white dwarfs or equivalent.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, a supernova explodes at only about 15000 km/sec, <br>
          which an advanced civilisation could perhaps be possible to <br>
          run away from. A lot of the energy is also released in the <br>
          form of neutrinos, which travel at approximately the speed <br>
          of light; but then again there is a very small cross section <br>
          for neutrino reactions, so one could stand a very heavy <br>
          neutrino shower without getting hurt.<br>
          <br>
          In general, the effect of any cosmic blast drops off as the <br>
          inverse cube of the distance. Since cosmic distances are <br>
          typically very large, such indiscriminate blasts would seem <br>
          to be ineffective as means of warfare. Even a supernova <br>
          explosion, which is about as violent as anything (short of <br>
          big bang, or vacum decay or a big chain reaction of <br>
          supernovae where such is possible) would not hurt us <br>
          significantly if it were a few light years away, and an <br>
          armoured civilisation could survive much closer.<br>
          <br>
          An "electomagnetic pulse of unspeakable amplitude" (Forrest <br>
          Bishop) would also seem like science fiction proper.<br>
          <br>
          It is important that we use realistic assumptions about the <br>
          conditions of cosmic warfare in our simulations. Since there <br>
          are still many unsolved problems in fundamental physics, I <br>
          suggest we set up several simulations with different <br>
          parameters for weapon technology. There are several relevant <br>
          variables here, such as projectile speed, production cost, <br>
          identifiability of aggressor, technology level required for <br>
          its manufacture, discrimination capabilities ("hurt only the <br>
          bad guys"), etc. Maybe the time is ripe to begin to try to <br>
          really work this out.<br>
