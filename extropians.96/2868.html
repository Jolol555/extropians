IAN: Your critique from top to bottom avoids the factual details <br>
and focuses attack on the personalities of those proposing theories <br>
you seem to be opposed to. You even refused to present any facts that<br>
invalidated the documents you totaly dismiss, choosing instead to call <br>
Salinger a "dishonest scoundrel" for possesing them. I cannot know<br>
his reasons for withholding them, but it looks pretty bad by any <br>
measure, but the TWA 800 crash is not about persnol reviews, <br>
at least not to me.<br>
<p>
The only logical-type argument I've seen you made is that it can't have <br>
been a naval hit because you can't get govt employees to keep secrets. <br>
The more evidence to the contrary we ignore, the more plausible this <br>
nonfactual argument appears to be. <br>
<p>
Your rationale for the nonpresentation of facts was an appeal to the <br>
inherent reliability of the authorities -- let them think for us and <br>
us smear all those who dare to think for themselves. It's such a worn-<br>
out tire. The more facts we ignore, the more we can believe that the <br>
FBI is a reliable source of unaltered physical evidence.<br>
<p>
If your only going to offer personal assessments rather than review <br>
of factual data or logical analysis of the case at hand, please don't <br>
reply or bother to draw me into further debate. Thanks.<br>
