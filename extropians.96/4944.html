I thought it was a hypothesis, they didn't find condensate in polar <br>
craters yet. One really ought model this, impact data, geometry, <br>
illumination, all being available. But then, no accurate model how Luna  <br>
loses gases exist, afair.<br>

Machines do not need wet chemistry/light elements. Those NASA papers on <br>
brick production/hydrogen reduction of iron were too conservative, imo. <br>
One can't use telluric ore production processes in space, obviously. <br>
Straight preparative mass spectroscopy give too little output by far, but <br>
how about molten soil electrolysis? Fractionary destillation? Whatever?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; linear induction accelerators for putting lunar resources into orbit,</i><br>
<p>
Yes! yes! Good, old linear motors. Apropos motors, they managed to build <br>
high-performance YBaCuO hot superconductor motors quite recently, for <br>
cryogenic pumps. Excellent data sheet. Still, it sounds good for <br>
low-luminance region use.<br>

You can nuke a lunar colony. One could probably nuke even a runaway <br>
lunar autoreplicator frenzy, but it certainly would be expensive. Still, <br>
watch out for the future equivalent of the Boston Tea party. No taxation <br>
without representation.<br>
