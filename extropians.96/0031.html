On Thursday I made a pledge that I will give $1000 a year for 10 years to the <br>
Prometheus Project. The idea behind the project is to start a profit  making <br>
company and obtain one million dollars a year for 10 years " for the  purpose <br>
of doing the scientific research necessary to convincingly  demonstrate and <br>
publish in peer reviewed journals, fully reversible brain cryopreservation". <br>
We're already up to $209,000 a year for 10 years and have been  looking for <br>
money for less than a month.   <br>
 <br>
I have always thought that Nanotechnology would be needed for reversible  <br>
brain  cryopreservation, but too many people I respect think otherwise for me  <br>
to ignore the possibility that something much simpler might work. Although  <br>
small by some standards this would be the largest research project ever <br>
undertaken in this area, the largest by far. The low hanging fruit has not  <br>
been picked yet, so Interesting things will certainly be found, and if the  <br>
goal is actually reached the  world will never be the same. <br>
 <br>
I can't imagine ever regretting this decision, if it works I'll be rather  <br>
proud of myself for helping, and I might even make some money, gaining  <br>
immortality wouldn't be too bad either. If the goal is not reached at least I  <br>
won't be tormented with the thought that it failed because people like me had  <br>
no interest in it.<br>
