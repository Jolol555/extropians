<i>&gt; Lyle Burkhead has informed me that I have discovered the </i><br>

<i>&gt; Is that true?  Are you guys all dogmatic athiests?  </i><br>
<p>
I'm on your side, David.  I'm not a dogmatic atheist.  I'm a <br>
creedal minimalist.  Maybe you haven't been on the list long enough <br>
to be aware that I'm something of an outsider here.  When I refer to <br>
"Extropians," I don't necessarily include myself.  The fact that I don't <br>
hold religion in contempt is one thing that separates me from <br>
Extropians. <br>
<p>
I agree with much of what you say.  I particularly like the fact that you <br>
didn't say God was omnipotent or omniscient.  In fact, I meant to <br>
pick up on something Chris Hind said, and start a similar thread myself, <br>
but you beat me to it.  <br>
<p>
I can't say much about this right now.  Theology requires a level of <br>
logical/metaphysical acumen that is beyond my grasp in my present <br>
feverish state.   I can talk about rudeness, but God is a bit more difficult.  <br>
However, I do want to make a couple of comments.  <br>
1.  One of the worst mistakes one can make in this field is to assume <br>
that God is a "hypothesis."  God isn't a hypothesis any more than <br>
objective reality is a hypothesis.  <br>
2.   A point of eristic strategy:  in a field were arguments easily <br>
degenerate into semantic arguments, it is a good idea to invent new <br>
terminology instead of using words that carry a lot of baggage, <br>
such as the G-word.  <br>
