The definition of "extropy" has evolved over time. If there's to be a<br>
discussion of it, it would be good to begin with the most current version,<br>
as printed in Extropy #17. That definition says nothing about a "measure". I<br>
took that out because it implies some kind of metric, while the concept of<br>
"extropy" was never intended to be a technical term. There's already a term<br>
for that -- "negentropy".<br>
<p>
The current definition is" "Extropy -- the extent of a person's or a<br>
culture's intelligence, information, vitality, diversity, opportunity, and<br>
[personal] growth." "Personal" might be removed since it fits with person<br>
but not very well with culture.<br>
<p>
While I'm all in favor of tuning up this definition, I caution against<br>
trying for a pseudo-precision. It's not a scientific measure. Its a metaphor<br>
the the kinds of things we value, and for the overcoming of human limits in<br>
a perpetual process of improvement.<br>
<p>
Note: While I have been giving the definitions for years, it was Tom Morrow<br>
who originally coined the term based on our discussions together, not me.<br>
