  The December issue of Byte magazine has an article entitled "Eight Ways to<br>
the Future:  The Future of Microcomputing" in which a panel of eight<br>
luminaries provide thoughts and predictions.  Byte presents this information<br>
as snippets in a tabular format - a style which makes superficiality<br>
difficult to avoid.  Check out <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9612/sec6/art7.htm">http://www.byte.com/art/9612/sec6/art7.htm</a><br>
<p>
Three discussants mention nanotechnology:<br>
<p>
Marc Andreessen, Netscape Communications<br>
David Chaum, DigiCash<br>
Doug Engelbart, Bootstrap Institute<br>
<p>
Excerpts:<br>
<p>
Question: How long will Moore's Law continue to be relevant?<br>
<p>
Answer: Marc Andreessen: Through 2020, when we will see a discontinuous<br>
improvement in performance rejoining a new Moore's Law curve based on a<br>
transition toward molecular nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
Question: When will quantum effects and other problems require radically new<br>
chip technologies?<br>
<p>
Answer: Marc Andreessen: Probably until about 2007. By that time, however,<br>
dramatically new chip technologies based on quantum dots and tunneling will<br>
have begun to arrive.<br>
<p>
Answer: David Chaum:  I'm not sure we will be forced to develop<br>
nanotechnology, but I sure hope we do.<br>
<p>
Answer: Doug Engelbart:  We'll run out of gas in 10 years. Eventually we'll<br>
be arranging individual molecules.<br>
<p>
Question: Will we manufacture chips in zero-gravity environments in orbital<br>
fabs anytime soon?<br>
<p>
Answer: Marc Andreessen: Only as an unlikely and distant possibility.<br>
Nanotechnology will have begun to bear fruit before zero-gravity chip<br>
manufacturing makes sense.<br>
<p>
The Engelbart comment above is ambiguous since one can manipulate individual<br>
atoms without having a nanotechnological capability; however, in the<br>
introductory article at <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9612/sec6/art6.htm">http://www.byte.com/art/9612/sec6/art6.htm</a><br>
the following appears:<br>
<p>
   Adds Doug Engelbart, legendary inventor of computing technology and<br>
   founding director of the Bootstrap Institute: "If you look at the whole<br>
   array of digital technology, the microprocessor is just a part of that.<br>
   Nanotechnology will eventually take us way beyond [microprocessors]." <br>
