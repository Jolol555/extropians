This debate seems to be going in circles, so let me summarize my view:<br>
<p>
Really, what is claimed by the originators of the navy missile + cover-up<br>
theory is that the U.S. government knew the cause from the very beginning<br>
and has somehow tricked the entire population into believing there is an<br>
"investigation" going on.  This is just as preposterous as someone claiming<br>
to have invented an anti-gravity machine in the absence of significant<br>
prior research.<br>
<p>
The 100+ eyewitnesses may have seen a missile, or they may have seen<br>
something else -- people sometimes misinterpret what they see in the dark.<br>
But one thing I am certain they didn't see: hundreds of people converging<br>
on the crash site to cover it up.<br>
