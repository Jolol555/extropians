<p>
<p>
I'm no expert on them either, the fact is there are no experts on Quantum                 <br>
Computers, they're too new, everybody is stumbling around in the dark.                                <br>
<p>

<i>               &gt;John, could you please explain them a bit and then explain                 </i><br>
<i>               &gt;why they would bring about radical changes to the world?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The short answer is that although a conventional computer could (probably) <br>
solve any problem a Quantum Computer could if it had enough time, a small <br>
Quantum Computer, if a practical one could ever actually be made, could solve  <br>
problems almost instantly that would take a conventional computer, even a <br>
Nanocomputer, many billions of years to solve. I hope you're not asking me  <br>
what changes this would bring to the world because I have no idea, but I  <br>
don't see how a machine of such cosmic power could leave the Universe  <br>
unchanged. Most of the following is a rehash of stuff I sent to the list  <br>
in the past year.<br>
<p>
In the April 12 1996 issue of Science there is an article on Quantum  <br>
Computers. It makes clear that a  Quantum Computer has not yet been proven to <br>
be consistent with the laws of Physics, but nevertheless, the article had a <br>
very optimistic tone, an optimism I did not see just one year ago. If such <br>
a machine could be built the ramifications are mind boggling.<br>
           <br>
When a conventional 64 bit single processor computer performs an operation, <br>
it does it on ONE 64 bit number at a time. When a 64 bit (actually a 64 qubit) <br>
single processor QUANTUM computer performs an operation, it does it on ALL 64 <br>
bit numbers at the same time, all 2^64 of them, more than a billion billion, <br>
and any increase in the number of qubits the computer can handle will <br>
increase it's already astronomical power exponentially. <br>
<p>
It gets even wilder, because the quantum mechanical state of the matter in <br>
the machine's memory determines the output, Seth Lloyd of MIT thinks you <br>
could run the machine in reverse, feed in information and change the state <br>
of the memory,  the result would be a quantum mechanical micromanipulator.<br>
<p>
Despite this enormous increase in performance and a possible short cut to <br>
Nanotechnology, most weren't very interested because it didn't seem like a  <br>
Quantum Computer could ever be built. The slightest error or interaction with <br>
the outside environment would render the machine inoperative, conventional <br>
error correcting codes don't work in the quantum domain and most said that <br>
correcting codes for quantum mechanical information was impossible. <br>
They were wrong.<br>
<p>
Late last year Peter Shor of ATT showed how to encode a piece of quantum  <br>
information in a 9 qubit system so that the information is retained even if <br>
there is an error in one of the 9 qubits. A few months later researchers at <br>
IBM refined Shor's technique so that only 5 qubits were needed, and found  <br>
ways to correct for multiple errors. <br>
 <br>
The trouble was, although Shor's idea worked well for storing and <br>
transmitting quantum information without error, it did not work for the <br>
actual calculation, many thought that surely was impossible. <br>
It turns out they were wrong about that too.<br>
<p>
In the August 30 1996 issue of Science is an article by J. I. Cira,  <br>
T. Pellizzari, and P. Zoller entitled "Enforcing Coherent Evolution In  <br>
Dissipative Quantum Dynamics". They propose a Quantum error correcting scheme <br>
with modest computational overhead that would dramatically increase the <br>
number of quantum logic gates the machine could have before errors made it <br>
unreliable. If p is probability that a single gate will fail, then without <br>
error correction a Quantum Computer can only have 1/p gates as a practical <br>
matter. With this new quantum error correcting code it can have 4/p^2 gates <br>
before errors overwhelm it. For example, if the probability that one gate <br>
will fail is .09 then if you have no error correction your Quantum Computer<br>
better not have more that 11 logic gates, with this new error correcting idea <br>
it could have 494 logic gates without making more errors than the 11 did. <br>
 <br>
Until very recently the only useful program known to be able to run on these <br>
machines was one to factor large numbers for code breaking. Unfortunately <br>
there are problems, to factor a 100 digit number the machine would need to <br>
perform millions of quantum logical operations without being effected by the <br>
outside environment, even with the newly discovered quantum error correcting <br>
codes that would not be easy to do, not for that many operations. In the <br>
August 23 1996  Science is a fascinating research article by Seth Lloyd called <br>
"Universal  Quantum Simulators". Lloyd has found a way for quantum computers <br>
to do something far, FAR, more useful than factoring numbers, and is much <br>
easier for the machines to do too.<br>
                <br>
In quantum mechanics it's often possible in theory to predict what something  <br>
will do but not in practice because of computational complexity, that's why <br>
Chemists must still perform experiments. To simulate the behavior of N <br>
electrons, in a conventional computer you would need memory space and <br>
computation time proportional to 2^2N. Just to figure out what's going on with <br>
40 electrons, like those found in a medium sized  atom, you would need to <br>
perform 10^24 operations. It's no wonder that Chemists keep their test tubes.<br>
 <br>
Lloyd found a way to perform the same simulation using just N quantum bits <br>
(qubits) and the number of operations the quantum machine must do is  <br>
proportional to N, not 2^2N as on a conventional computer. In addition, the <br>
time required to do the simulation over time t is proportional to t, in other <br>
words it can do it in real time, like an Analog computer. A very important<br>
feature of Lloyd's algorithm is that it doesn't demand that the Quantum <br>
computer be a perfect machine that is totally isolated from the environment, <br>
it easily deals with errors. Incredibly, noise from the environment and <br>
decoherence can be useful to the computer, it can actually help it simulate <br>
noise and decoherence in the system it's simulating.<br>
                         <br>
In a separate development, Lov K Grover of ATT recently found a way for a  <br>
Quantum Computer to find a piece of information in a random list with N items <br>
in just the square root of N steps, not 1/2 N steps, which is the  average if <br>
you do this on a conventional computer.<br>
   <br>
Apparently the appeal of making a calculation on 2^n numbers at the same time  <br>
with a machine that only has n qbits is too strong for the military to ignore.  <br>
In the same issue of Science is an article about the defense department  <br>
making a 5 million dollar grant to start an institute for Quantum Information  <br>
and Computing (QUIC).  It's charter has 5 aims.<br>
<p>
1) Improve quantum algorithms.<br>
2) Improve quantum logic gates. <br>
3) Improve the architecture of Quantum Computers. <br>
4) Improve quantum error correcting codes.<br>
5) Study the general theory behind quantum computation.<br>
                      <br>
This may help put a stop to all the "End Of Science" books we've been seeing <br>
lately. People were saying that it was a waste of time to try to find a <br>
quantum theory of gravity because there would be no way to test it. It would  <br>
be a HUGE calculation, but a thousand qubit quantum computer could do it.  <br>
Lloyd says we could make a Quantum Computer today with a few tens of qubits<br>
and it would "require only minor modifications of current technology". <br>
I'd say that's a pretty good start. He also says "The wide variety of atomic, <br>
molecular, and semiconductor quantum devices available suggests that quantum <br>
simulation may soon be a reality". His August 23 article is even more optimistic<br>
than the April 12 article.<br>
<p>
I find all this very exciting, it must have been like this in the late 1930's <br>
when reports trickled in about nuclear fission and the idea occurred to <br>
people that a bizarre device like a nuclear bomb might actually be able to <br>
exist in the real world.<br>
                                                <br>
