In message &lt;UPMAIL02.199610262006030598@msn.com&gt;, David Musick writes in<br>
response to Chris Hind:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Chris, engineers ARE artists.  They are artists who love great precision in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their work.  They design their machines and structures according to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own aesthetic parameters, to fulfill certain functions. </i><br>
<p>
Although there is much truth in the above, this unification is not helpful.<br>
<p>
For the engineer, the aesthetic of fulfilling those certain functions is<br>
very secondary to the fulfillment of the functions themselves, so much so<br>
that the aesthetic is often totally submerged.  Yes, we often search for<br>
(say) an "elegant" solution, but to a large extent this is just a heuristic<br>
that we use because seeking elegance has yielded well-performing products<br>
in the past.  To call engineering "art" just results in confusion;  it's<br>
much more accurate to step back from unifying all of existence under "art"<br>
and instead merely observe that engineers do employ quite a few techniques<br>
that are not within the scope of the scientific method, and that some of<br>
those could quite validly be discussed under the banner of "art".  That is<br>
a more analytic and helpful view, and much less confusing.<br>
<p>
