I think the biggest advantage of such a fast computer would be that <br>
any a-life organisms/programs grown on it would evolve to the maximum <br>
capacity of the memory in zero time!  The initial program could be <br>
quite simple, but it must be able to change itself.  There would have <br>
to be a lot of sensible input so that it could develop a complex <br>
relationship between it's input and output.  It would need feedback <br>
from the real world to verify that it's evolutionary path will lead <br>
it to where we are now (otherwise we will not be able to understand <br>
it), it can go further on it's own, as long as it first checks in at <br>
homosapien-semantics-1996.  <br>
<p>
Intelligence: The relationship between your input and output ;-)<br>
<p>
Could it even be done? &gt; <br>
<p>
There is no doubt it my mind that it can and will be done.<br>
