I like this analysis, and I think it's correct as far as it goes.<br>
<p>
But you know, when most people ask for definitions, they want a genus and<br>
differentiator. And the sad fact is that they usually want to be presented<br>
with a genus that they already understand and a differentiator that they<br>
already understand.<br>
<p>
Some people like to see extropians as part of the genus "technophile" or<br>
"futurist" or what-have-you, and use the libertarian stuff to differentiate<br>
them. Other people like to see extropians as part of the genus "classical<br>
liberal" or "libertarian" or what-have-you, and then try to come up with<br>
differentia that separate out the conservatives, fundamentalist Christians,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
Reformulating things the way Steve Witham has here is great fun and does<br>
help us on the list think more clearly about these things, but "BUFF" is<br>
not going to be a useful explanation of extropians to those who don't<br>
already know for a while yet. We also need to come up with explanations<br>
that don't need to be explained in turn, simple sequences of words that are<br>
readily understandable to the vast majority of speakers of English who<br>
aren't already immersed in this stuff.<br>
<p>
But I still loved Steve's post.<br>
