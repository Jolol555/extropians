I have found one psychological concept very helpful here: learned<br>
helplessness. If you try something repeatedly, but don't succeed<br>
(especially if you have never experienced success in the first place), you<br>
"learn" that you will never succeed, and don't even try anymore. This is <br>
IMHO a major problem facing us transhumanists in all areas - too many <br>
people are feeling helpless to do anything.<br>
<p>
Learned helplessness is also the reason I do not fully believe that a <br>
free market will solve all problems - too many people are passive and <br>
will not act, even when it is clearly in their best interest (of course, <br>
a wellfare state can be said to promote this, but the problem remains <br>
even without them).  <br>
