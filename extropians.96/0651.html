In message &lt;199608281542.IAA12605X0@primenet.com&gt;, Natasha V. More writes:<br>

<i>&gt; I stated months ago that I thought UIF was, perhaps, sloopy</i><br>
<i>&gt; in its authorship.  It's original purpose, so to speak, was mutated.  Thus,</i><br>
<i>&gt; my intent was to drop UIF and develop another way of viewing my individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedoms.</i><br>
<p>
Well, "sloppy in its authorship" is a bit hard.  Admittedly, you coined<br>
the phrase but didn't define the concept, but that isn't necessarily<br>
sloppy.  You left it to the rest of us on the &gt;H list to define it, and<br>
that was surely good for the subject matter and for the community.  Our<br>
work didn't take the path you expected, it took the path that those that<br>
worked on it determined, which can't be a surprise to anyone.<br>
<p>
If you want an ideology that meets your own requirements exactly, I'm<br>
afraid you're going to have to develop it yourself, Natasha!  (:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Rich added much to the phrase, carefully developing his view of its purpose,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Peter and Greg also did much work on it.  To my knowledge there was much</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagreement regarding its objectivity and/or subjectivity.  This was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem for me, thus my continued search for a phrase that I could identify</i><br>
<i>&gt; with because I found myself somewhere between their views - but leaning more</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards Peter and Greg's summation.</i><br>
<p>
For the benefit of those that didn't follow the numerous threads on<br>
this subject over many many months on the other list, the disagreement<br>
over direction was resolved in a manner totally in keeping with the<br>
spirit of UIF:  I placed the form of UIF in which all value judgements<br>
are entirely subjective into my personal memetic pigeonhole labouring<br>
under a banner of "TransIndividualism" (&gt;I), a totally individualistic<br>
ideology based on scientific empiricism on the objective side plus an<br>
axiomatic base of TransIndividualistic Freedom (&gt;IF) on the subjective<br>
side.  This has extended my freedom while not reducing that of others.<br>
(The only downside is that it leaves my tongue in knots. :-)<br>
<p>
That left the label "UIF" available for redefinition by those that did<br>
not feel comfortable with a world in which there can be no objectivity<br>
in matters of value judgement.  As it happens, nobody has picked up that<br>
gauntlet yet, which is a great pity --- I'd love to debate it.<br>
<p>
Rich.<br>
