  (Btw, what was the "META" about?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Chris said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;...Why deny the fact that emotion is</i><br>
<i>&gt;[vestigial] and only for mere entertainment now that we have logic?</i><br>
<p>
"Cut out my spleen, I want to live free!"  This is, like, the sentiment<br>
that wants to be put out of its own misery as soon as we have the tools.<br>

Mike's answers are good, but I wanted to add:<br>
<p>
Emotion is the logic of values, your internal economics.  It's how you<br>
decide what to do, both outside of yourself (physical action) and inside<br>
(directing attention, or as AI people say, "directing search").  With logic<br>
alone you can calculate outcomes from premises, but not prefer one outcome<br>
to another.  Not even have a concept of "interesting" versus "boring"<br>
theorems.  There would be no desire for "mere entertainment" without<br>
emotions.  Once you have preferences and ways to apply them, you're<br>
starting to simulate the reptilian and mammalian brains all over again.<br>
Don't be too quick to dismiss their sophistication.<br>
<p>
    Logic is, and by rights ought to be, slave to the emotions.<br>
