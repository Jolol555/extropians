<i>&gt; HAHAHAHAHA, Oh yeah. This is optimistic!</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure quite what you meant by that, but really, the whole thread<br>
was the last straw.  Can't you guys just walk out and do something?  Are<br>
you going to be struck by lightning if you look up his email and send<br>
him some?  For crying out loud, what's the worst that can happen?  He's<br>
not going to send out hit squads.  I have to deal with this kind of<br>
insecurity and inaction in myself and I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH<br>
IT IN ANYONE ELSE.  You guys have mental energy to burn and you're<br>
sitting around doing less than I am.<br>
<p>
Can't I even get a rise out of you people?  Do you think you're going to<br>
get to the Singularity by sitting around and doing nothing?  Someday I<br>
may want minions or advice or even constructive criticism, and I'm not<br>
getting it.  I've gotten more constructive criticism from my<br>
technophobic grandparents.<br>
<p>
You're Extropians.  Say something new!  I haven't heard anything new on<br>
this list that wasn't quoted from an article.  Where's the new ideas?  I<br>
live off of new ideas.  New ideas are all that's important because it is<br>
new ideas that cause technological progress.  My bookmarks are chosen<br>
for information density and information density is measured in new<br>
ideas.  What's the censored point of flipping through all this flipping<br>
email if I'm not going to come out knowing more than I came in?<br>
<p>
There is a time for for talking, a time for planning, and a time to just<br>
go out and do something.  The time for talking was over when the first<br>
computer was switched on.  The time for talking was over when it became<br>
possible to find out the Meaning of Life by building superintelligences<br>
instead of philosophizing.  Now is the time for serious, practical<br>
plans, and occasionally the time for action.  Soon the edge of the<br>
Singularity will be in full bloom, perhaps before the next summer.  By<br>
that time you'd damn well better have all our plans in place because the<br>
instant it becomes possible, I am going to go out and do something!<br>
<p>
You think Marc Andreessen would be a valuable recruit?  Send him email. <br>
Send him a letter.  Plan it, design it, or just go out and DO it.  Don't<br>
talk about it.  ONE POST saying that he'd be a valuable recruit is ALL<br>
that's necessary in the way of talk.  After that, start discussing<br>
practical aspects of the letter ("Should we stress the Singularity, the<br>
Extropian culture, or that philosophical question he couldn't answer?"),<br>
or else just send the damn thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question is how do we get to him? Anyone know ANY POSSIBLE way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; contacting him? Does anyone have his email and does he actually read it?</i><br>
<p>
A practical question!  Unfortunately, it's fairly clear that nobody<br>
tried to look him up via Alta Vista.  "Does he actually read it?"  No,<br>
maybe a secretary does.  But I'm sure someone reads  it.  If that<br>
doesn't work we can corner him at a convention.<br>
<p>
DO SOMETHING!<br>
DO SOMETHING!<br>
DO SOMETHING!<br>
