This is a direct example of my claim.  You see people vote for<br>
politicians you don't like, and you conclude it must be because they<br>
have been fooled, that they are under an "illusion".  Maybe, to the<br>
contrary, most voters are well aware of these various negative aspects<br>
of our political systems.  Maybe the reason they don't all demand a<br>
change is that they don't know of a better political system. <br>
