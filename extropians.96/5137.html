<p>
Note -- "level", not "amount".  I used to worry about the fact that I made<br>
so many posts that nobody responded to until I started asking people if<br>
they were ignoring them because they were so inane.  More often they seemed<br>
to like the post and just to have little to add.  It seems that I get more<br>
overt attention when people disagree than when they agree.<br>
<p>
Keith, perhaps you can add to your draft a further explanation of the success<br>
of run-you-down trainings like EST -- even if the attention is negative,<br>
it's attention, and many people crave attention.  Actually, negative attention<br>
may be _more_ effective (at least as an initial hook) for those with low<br>
self-esteem; from my own experience with Lifespring, I recall that I responded<br>
to criticism-bombing with remorse, resignation, and a sense that the people<br>
doing it knew me very well (and a determination to do better so they would<br>
think better of me in the future, which was probably the main intent of the<br>
instructors), but to praise-bombing with complete rejection and panic --<br>
actually, I don't think I'd have screamed any more if they'd been flaying<br>
my skin off.  I think I was an extreme case, but in degree, not in kind.<br>
<p>
I got better.  I'm still struggling with self-esteem issues, so I might still<br>
be vulnerable to a workshop attack, but I've definitely made progress.<br>
