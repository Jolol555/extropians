From: Crosby_M &lt;CrosbyM@po1.cpi.bls.gov&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; BTW, David Brin's latest novels (recently finished the brand-new </i><br>
<i>&gt; _Infinity's Shore_, second book in a trilogy) explores this mentality as </i><br>
<i>&gt; embodied in a religion that sees the Path of Redemption to be a return to </i><br>
<i>&gt; pre-sapience.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if we will see David Brin begin to push this notion on his own.<br>
<p>
Normally I would not suggest that a character's (or even a culture's)<br>
views would mirror the author's, but in the case of Brin I am not so<br>
sure.  He wrote a book, Earth, which had a society which was built on<br>
the premise that privacy was bad.  I thought it was an interesting if<br>
unlikely concept.  (Actually it didn't seem that effective in the book,<br>
since many of the key events did take place as a result of secrecy.)<br>
<p>
Now Brin himself has come out seriously proposing that privacy is evil,<br>
and that we should restructure society to prevent it!  He has an article<br>
in the December, 1996 issue of Wired magazine pushing this idea.  He<br>
believes that privacy and anonymity shield criminals, that they allow<br>
misbehavior by powerful elements in society, that they are more available<br>
to the rich than the poor and therefore are a destabilizing influence.<br>
He is also, as a result, against the use of cryptography and similar<br>
technologies to protect privacy.<br>
<p>
I exchanged a few letters with him on this topic two years ago, but neither<br>
of us managed to change the other's mind.  I think it is such a totally<br>
misguided notion that it was hard even to find ground to discuss it.<br>
<p>
It's possible that his writing technique involves such a detailed<br>
visualization of the society that he is describing that he can't help<br>
but begin to adopt the mores and customs he is writing about.  If so,<br>
maybe in a couple of years Brin will become an advocate of the Human<br>
Degeneration movement.<br>
