From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; There is a type of "active" composite that has the properties you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; describing.  It is a laminate composite consisting of piezo-electric</i><br>
<i>&gt; ceramics  and shape-memory alloys from the nickel-titanium family.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; When vibrations hit the ceramic outer laminate, the ceramic acts as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; transducer, converting the vibration into an electrical signal.  The signal</i><br>
<i>&gt; is inverted (It may be inverted via an anisotropic material property.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; not sure.) and fed into the shape-memory alloy.  The alloy flexes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduces the inverted signal, similar to a speaker, through the ceramic.</i><br>
<p>
This is an interesting discussion, which I unfortunately don't know enough<br>
solid state physics to contribute to.<br>
<p>
However my instincts are that some of these ideas are based on a macroscopic<br>
model which won't work at the level we are talking about.  These atomic<br>
vibrations are themselves heat.  The notion of going in and producing<br>
counter vibrations which will cancel these smacks of violating the Third<br>
Law.<br>
<p>
Of course refrigerators do exist, and there is nothing wrong with heat<br>
flowing from a cold to a hot object as long as entropy somehow balances<br>
out.  But when you are talking about heat flowing from a cold to a hot<br>
molecule, it is hard to see how to do it.<br>
<p>
I know that one way refrigerators work is by evaporation, which in effect<br>
means that we filter molecules, allowing the high speed ones to go away<br>
and keeping just the low speed ones.  We don't actually slow any down in<br>
this process but we do end up with low energy molecules.  However it is<br>
not clear how to apply this to the atom-in-a-box example.<br>
