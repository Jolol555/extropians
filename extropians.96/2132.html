That depends on what you mean by "write".  No formal thesis anywhere,<br>
that I know of.  The temporary godlings of "True Names" took over<br>
much of the world, but that's a standard cyberpunk cliche.  I think _A<br>
Fire Upon the Deep_ and _Marooned in Realtime_ would have the most<br>
examples of perversion warfare.  At the end of _Fire_ prologue the<br>
Blight has no weaponry, but has already perverted the human ship's<br>
computers, so It is able to sabotage the escape internally.  And it<br>
perverts lots of Beyonders later.  More to the point, Beyonders refuse<br>
to take messages in High Trade languages directly, but translate them<br>
into duller tongues (such as the ones we know) because of the<br>
possibility of perversion through such messages.  (Presumably High<br>
Tongues are semi-automatic languages like Java or Word macros, and<br>
nobody wants to deal with Trojans from a Power.)  The point being that<br>
it seemed to be a common form of warfare to pervert other's systems.<br>
And the entire climax of _Marooned_ centers on someone having perverted<br>
most of the systems -- and he was a relic from an age where such was<br>
common industrial espionage/warfare.<br>
