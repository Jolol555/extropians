	Over six months ago I asked the list what I might do to "need less<br>
sleep".  Someone suggested DMAE, Arginine/Ornithine, and Melatonin at<br>
bedtime.  The results were great!  Sorry I can't remember who made the<br>
suggestion!  But, thanks!<br>
<p>
	At the time, I thought I was just suffering from the exhaustion of<br>
being involved in a precarious business venture (not my book business)<br>
that required burning the midnight oil quite often.  I was irritated that<br>
I would fall asleep just about any time I sat down to read, watch TV, or<br>
talk to a friend.  When I would go to bed at a normal time I could sleep<br>
no more than 3 or 4 hours.  I would wake up worrying about tasks ahead of<br>
me.  I should have known something more was involved, a chronic sleep<br>
disorder of some type, probably brought on by age....I am 54 now.  The<br>
objective situation was not that different from College or earlier<br>
business problems when I maintained a rather normal sleep schedule.<br>
<p>
	100 mg of DMAE and 4 grams of Arginine/Ornthine w/varying doses of<br>
melatonin at bedtime almost immediately restored my power to control my<br>
sleep in a normal manner.  After I have been up late, I might get tired<br>
early the next evening, but can control once again when I decide to go to<br>
bed.  I would estimate that I can now get along with 6 hours of sleep per<br>
day with no discomfort while historically I needed 7-8 hours.<br>
<p>
	The amount of melatonin seems to make little difference re:  the<br>
sleep disorder except as regards dreaming.  The DMAE seems to be the main<br>
factor.  Melatonin alone didn't help much though I felt better.  I tried<br>
melatonin before I got the DMAE advice.  I had been taking the<br>
Arginine/Ornithine in the AM with the rest of my supplements previously.<br>
<p>
	I began taking DHEA (25mg) in the am about 2 months ago.  No big<br>
change occured though I think I felt a little better and my sex appetitie<br>
increased some.<br>
<p>
	A woman friend who has had problems with depression on and off<br>
felt much much better with DHEA.<br>

PS.  Now!  If I could just get the discipline to exercise regularly!<br>
