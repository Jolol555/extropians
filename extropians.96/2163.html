&lt;Personally I think this kind of hyperweapons we discuss above are very<br>

"Perversion attacks" a la Vinge are more likely - infiltrate the enemy<br>
with nanites or AI viruses, and then destroy him subtly. One could<br>
imagine tiny berzerkers (gremlins?) that move around a la von Neumann<br>
probes, and when they find a civilization they study it, send out very<br>
subtle agents, and then plans its downfall using SI.&gt;<br>

I fail to follow the reasoning behind that whole Hanson-Bishop<br>
discussion that aliens would likely have a "kill them and eat them"<br>
attitude rather than a "study them and trade with them" approach.<br>

Perhaps the latest story to explore the scenario of Earth being invaded<br>
by AI-driven nanites is Ian McDonald's 12/95 novel _Evolution's Shore_.<br>
It starts with anomalies being observed in the outer solar system, soon<br>
followed by probes which land on Earth and begin spreading a<br>
cotton-candy-like nano-goo called 'Chaga', particularly in poorer parts<br>
of the Earth like Africa.  The story follows an intrepid reporter,<br>
scientists and bureaucrats as they all try to find out what the Chaga is<br>
up to and take advantage of it.  In the end, all sides end up taking<br>
advantage of each other (the Extropian approach?)<br>
