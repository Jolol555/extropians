Ira Brodsky is concerned about children being taught that things are grey and <br>
uncertain.  Yes, there are facts that we are very certain about, and it's <br>
important that children are taught these facts.  However, it's also a fact <br>
that most things are uncertain to us, and we need to develop the appropriate <br>
mental skills to adaquately deal with uncertainty.  The big mistake that A LOT <br>
of people make is to think that because nearly everything is uncertain, that <br>
these things are all uncertain *to the same degree*, that everything is <br>
*equally* uncertain.  Some people say that everything is relative, so you <br>
can't hold one opinion or belief to be better than any other.  Of course, they <br>
neglect to consider that some beliefs are ALWAYS *relatively* BETTER than <br>
others (just like 500 is relatively more than 3).  The mistake is in lumping <br>
all greyness together into one category, when there are actually many shades <br>
of grey.  Some facts are more certain than others.  And when thinking about <br>
these facts, you must consider how certain they are and how much weight to <br>
give them in your reasoning.  Read 'Fuzzy Thinking' by Bart Kosko.  He shows <br>
how to reason with fuzzy and uncertain knowledge.<br>
<p>
I do agree with Ira that our educational systems are pretty fucked-up.  <br>
However, I think that children must be taught facts AND they must be taught <br>
how to reason appropriately with insufficient and uncertain information.  But <br>
Ira's right, there's a tremendous amount of political indoctrination going on <br>
in the Slave Training Institutes, which are euphemistically called Public <br>
Schools.  And I think that often, the children there are being taught that <br>
everything is equally uncertain, so you can just believe anything, because no <br>
belief is better than any other.  This is just one of the many forms of mental <br>
sabotage inflicted upon our children by our government.<br>
<p>
I wonder if the majority will ever figure out how they've been duped.  Will <br>
they ever realize that the government is really just a con game, run by con <br>
men who call themselves "public servants"?  The goods they sell are terribly <br>
shoddy, and the prices they charge are outrageous!  Yet people keep coming <br>
back for more.  Of course, they haven't yet realized that their religions are <br>
con games either.  I think humans have a high capacity for being deluded.  And <br>
I'm no exception; I'm just *less* deluded than the majority of people (at <br>
least, I like to think so).<br>
