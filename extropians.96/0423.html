I made a lot of progress in the last day understanding the<br>
implications of the biological evidence regarding the Great Filter.<br>
Here is an excerpt from the current version of my paper.  Robin<br>
<p>
-------------------<br>
Excerpt from: <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html</a><br>
 <br>
On the other hand, the historical step-by-step "march of progress" we<br>
seem to see in the fossil record would seem to create difficulties for<br>
the view that any one of these steps is astronomically unlikely.  If a<br>
step is so improbable, one might ask, then why did it happen so<br>
quickly after its preceding enabling step?  That is, if the expected<br>
time for some step on any one planet is many trillions of years, they<br>
why would it happen on Earth in only a few hundred million years?<br>
After all, and the oldest known stars are now 15 billion years old,<br>
our sun would seem to have another five billion years of life left,<br>
and yet the longest known evolutionary step (from simple to complex<br>
cells) only took about 1.7 billion years.  <br>
<p>
It turns out that this is probably not a problem, however, and it is<br>
useful to understand why.  Assume that a certain set of steps are to<br>
be completed in a certain order within a certain total time window,<br>
and that for each step there is some constant probability per unit time<br>
of completing that step, given that the previous step has been<br>
completed.  If the probability of completing all the steps within the<br>
time window is low, then for the cases where all the steps are in fact<br>
completed, it turns out that the average time to complete each "hard"<br>
step is unrelated to how hard that step is. <br>
<p>
For example, say you tried to complete four tasks in an hour (all of<br>
the "if you don't succeed at first, try try again" variety), where the<br>
expected time to complete each task was .1, 1, 10, and 100 hours<br>
respectively.  Then in those rare cases when you did complete all four<br>
tasks in the hour, the average time to complete the first task would<br>
be about .1 hours, but the average time to complete each of the others<br>
would be about 0.23 hours.  All the hard steps, no matter how hard,<br>
take about the same time, while easy steps take their usual time. <br>
<p>
There would also be an average of about 0.23 hours to spare left over<br>
after all the steps were complete.  And since the distributions are<br>
exponential, the standard deviation of each step size would be equal<br>
to its average.  Models where the window closing is also random give<br>
similar results.<br>
<p>
This sort of model seems to apply to the evolution of life on Earth.<br>
Since the Earth formed, there have been about five periods between<br>
major evolutionary changes, periods of roughly equal duration.<br>
Specifically, the earlist known fossils of simple single-cell life<br>
appeared 1.0 billion years after the earth was formed, and then the<br>
earlist known complex single-cell fossils appears 1.7 billion years<br>
after that.  0.8 billion years later the tempo of evolution suddenly<br>
picked up dramatically (perhaps with the introduction of sex [Schopf<br>
95]), and then 0.4 billion years later we see the first fossils of<br>
multi-cellular life [Knoll 95].  Finally, 0.6 billion years brings us<br>
to where we are today. <br>
<p>
To these five stages we might add two other discrete non- "try try<br>
again" type steps: an initial step of getting the right sort of planet<br>
around the right sort of star, and a final step of humanity either<br>
succeeding or destroying itself.  Together, these seven steps could<br>
explain the Great Filter if the (logarithmic) average filter per step<br>
was at least a factor of one thousand.  That is, either there might be<br>
a one in a thousand chance of passing a discrete step, or a one<br>
trillion year expected time to complete a "try try again" step. <br>
<p>
Of course we may find more steps as we get better fossil evidence, and<br>
we may have slighted some step which happened to take a particularly<br>
short time.  And of course the Great Filter need not be distributed<br>
evenly among these steps - just how much of the Filter rests in the<br>
last step is the ominous question that motivates our analysis.<br>
<p>
This model predicts that the expected time remaining until the window<br>
of opportunity for life on Earth closes is about one billion years.<br>
This model could therefore be confirmed by astronomical analysis<br>
regarding expected durations until the Earth is fried by a runaway<br>
greenhouse effect, by an unstable sun, a nearby supernovae, or by some<br>
other disaster ahead in the sun's travels through the galaxy. <br>
