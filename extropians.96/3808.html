<i>&gt;best. But in a subjective way we can. At least we can discuss it one the</i><br>
<i>&gt;list. Somebody wants to do a 3D IRC chatchannel? Let'm roll their own.)</i><br>
<p>
I must protest *strongly* against this line of thinking.  Although the<br>
content can be pretty much free-form, THE SOFTWARE MUST ADHERE TO STRICT,<br>
ORGANIZED,  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS.  Without a solid, capable software<br>
substrate to orchestrate the environment and resources, the operation of the<br>
world itself will be chaotic and unreliable.  All inter-user communications<br>
should be done using communications facilities and resources built into the<br>
system.<br>
<p>
Your "3D IRC chatchannel" is a perfect example.  If we let anyone roll their<br>
own software, the server may be critically impacted by the operation,<br>
design, and performance of that software.  IRC is a very good example of<br>
design and performance critical software.  A poorly designed IRC channel can<br>
bring even large servers to their knees.  We *must* have system level<br>
resource and communication control.  Without this, the system will operate<br>
poorly and operate at a small fraction of its theoretical throughput.  If a<br>
person wants an IRC channel, force them to use the communications API of the<br>
World engine.<br>
Not only will this force good design, but it will allow the software control<br>
system to regulate resource usage as well.  And fact is, if the underlying<br>
software (essentially the Operating System of the world) is well designed,<br>
the IRC will probably use fewer system resources and operate faster if it<br>
uses the system APIs.<br>
<p>
When the system is designed, I am envisioning an extensible and flexible<br>
binary interface with built in facilities for communication and interaction.<br>
You will still be able to extend the system to your liking, but the system<br>
will perform and operate much better than if everyone "does there own thing".  <br>
<p>
Unlike human systems, which can effectively operate in a chaotic fashion,<br>
software/protocol systems must be extremely precise and detailed.  This will<br>
require a very organized architecture and design.  There is much more to<br>
this than simply FTPing files to a server.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Max More is completely right in saying that the biggest problem in a task</i><br>
<i>&gt;like this is that we can get no pay, and that we work at different paces. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have a LOT of experience in zero finance projects. The only way they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;work is if there is some kind of personal gain. (Artistic or financial) If</i><br>
<i>&gt;the financial gain is out of the loop, then it is almost impossible to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;somebody to work for free on one's own pet project. We all wanna do our own</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing.</i><br>
<p>
I am not motivated by either artistic or financial incentives.  I am<br>
motivated because it is an opportunity to do something groundbreaking and<br>
interesting.  There are many different aspects to this project.  Sure, we<br>
may all want to do our own thing, but if we have the same general goal then<br>
we can still accomplish something.  And as I have mentioned before, *IF* we<br>
accomplish what we have been discussing, there is a significant possibility<br>
that it could have significant financial rewards in the future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We need to build a completely open system that we all can modify at our own</i><br>
<i>&gt;will. (well as much as possible.) The documentation should be there. Design</i><br>
<i>&gt;guides, technical limitations etc. But no overall design. With sections and</i><br>
<i>&gt;stuff. They will come automatically.</i><br>
<p>
It will probably require a powerful TCP/IP server engine coupled with a some<br>
type of small, fast database engine.  A number of communications and<br>
interaction APIs will have to be built into the system to allow users to<br>
build their own (Java?) software modules so that they can add their own<br>
functionality and designs to the world without inadvertently hindering or<br>
damaging the system.<br>
<p>
The entire world can then be built on top of this World engine.  What you do<br>
and put in the world is completely up to the user in any fashion the user<br>
chooses.<br>
The software must be a carefully detailed architecture, but the world does<br>
not have to be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let the beyond live it's own life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I could do cool VRML stuff today, maybe i could later add music, sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;effects and so on. (What about a 4Dimensional version of "LIFE" with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sound for when a cell dies and another when it is born. That could look</i><br>
<i>&gt;cool and make interresting sounds. with 3D balls(or pyramids) shifting</i><br>
<i>&gt;around in 3D space thru a 4th dimension. Whenever all the cells had died</i><br>
<i>&gt;new ones could be generated randomly.) Well just an idea :-)</i><br>
<p>
Do what you like.  It's a whole new world out there...  ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What we are designing is a social system. Let's use as many "off the shelf"</i><br>
<i>&gt;tools as possible. Moore's law tells us that they'll soon be wery</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerfull.</i><br>
<p>
All the technologies used will be off-the-shelf:  Java, C/C++, TCP/IP, HTML,<br>
VRML, etc.<br>
However, we may be forced to use these technologies in new and novel ways.<br>
As I mentioned above, this project will almost surely require a custom<br>
server engine.  If this project was so simple, someone would have done it<br>
already.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All we need to do is to establish an absolute minimum of rules that will</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow us to do it. Then we can do it and make our own dreams come thru.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They will probably match each other nicely.</i><br>
