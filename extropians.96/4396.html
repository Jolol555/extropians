          Those interested in the psychology of education and learning <br>
          may want to take a look at "Surpassing Ourselves" by <br>
          Bereiter and Scardamalia. I am usually not very fond of this <br>
          type of "soft" psychology, -neither numbers nor concrete <br>
          practical advise- but this book was endurable to me and <br>
          should therefore be very enjoyable for those with a taste <br>
          for this gengre.<br>
          <br>
          The basic idea is that what makes the difference between a <br>
          gifted individual that never becomes anything other than <br>
          "skilled" and one that becomes an "expert" (they use this <br>
          term broadly, to mean "outstanding, excellent; creative") is <br>
          in the way they approach the learning process. Most people <br>
          see it as a one-stage problem solving taks: they are faced <br>
          with a particular type of task, and when, after a while, <br>
          they have learnt master that task, the learning process is <br>
          over for their part. The "experts", on the other hand, take <br>
          an "expertlike" approach, which means that when they have <br>
          mastered the original task, they begin to redefine it to <br>
          include more challenging desiderata. A doctor may begin to <br>
          ponder *why* that treatment was successful, a car salesman <br>
          may extend his strategy so that it is not only effective in <br>
          selling a car to the prospective custmer, but also in <br>
          prompting him to come back another time, to recommend the <br>
          car shop to his friends, to become a personal friend to the <br>
          salesman etc. etc. In short, the expertlike learner <br>
          reinvests the resources in the learning process, and his set <br>
          of goals evolve as his goes along. All this sounds pretty <br>
          extropian.<br>
