&lt;Big snip questioning whether or not there is *a* God&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
        In my time in this universe I have come across many people who have<br>
fallen into this meme.  I think it is almost natural for extropian-type<br>
people to eventually ponder this question deeply.  We all want to see past<br>
limits...even of our own thinking.  When I say I'm an atheist, I mean that I<br>
don't believe in the *conventional* 'God' that is worshipped by billions.  I<br>
do, however, have a couple views on the prescence of other 'gods'.<br>
<p>
        One such view is that the universe itself is God.  As far as I know<br>
(and maybe ever will know), the universe has always been here.  As far as I<br>
know, the universe has no end; if it does have an end, I'll have to see it<br>
to believe it.  I just can't accept the thought that there is a physical<br>
limit that no-one can surpass.  If it *does* go on forever and always<br>
has\will be here, then it is God.  Every planet, quasar, galaxy et cetera,<br>
is within the universe and has been created by the universe.  Entropy<br>
happens *within* the universe.  Then the universe is omnipotent.  *That* I<br>
can accept.<br>
<p>
        Another of my views (even long before I read _Stranger In A Strange<br>
Land_) is quite common to transhumans: that we are all gods.  We create our<br>
own lives.  We can either make millions on a paradigm or live in a box on a<br>
city corner...or anything in between.  We create new beings (procreation),<br>
and eventually, new life forms all together (AIs, etc.).  If we wish to die<br>
or kill something, we can.  The main reason for people not to believe this<br>
is that we are not omnipotent.  The common question comes up: "But who made<br>
us?"  And no-one can answer convincingly enough to sway opinions.<br>
