        Well, I initially intended to just read this thread, but I think<br>
it's time for me to put my two cents in.  :-)  I agree with capitalistic<br>
views; that fact probably sways what I am about to say.  I don't look at <br>
property as being actual 'ownership'...it only is to an extent.  I see the<br>
purchase of property the equivalent of a dog urinating around 'its'<br>
property.  Just an exchange of money (a principle based system) to show<br>
others that it is yours to occupy.  It's not as if the property itself is<br>
going to object to someone claiming it.  The term 'property is theft' is a<br>
bit of a paradox: how can you steal something that nobody owns?  When a<br>
subsequent exchange of money occurs, it is no longer the property that is<br>
occupied, but a principle equivalent.  Not stealing, exchanging.<br>
