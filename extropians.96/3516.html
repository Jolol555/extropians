I don't see why we need AI at all to reach the singularity!!!<br>
<p>
I make a living designing interfaces, and finding new ways of comunicating.<br>
As far as i can se we don't need AI at all to reach it.<br>
<p>
It should be possible to do it by simple means of software engineering. As<br>
we make new generations of software they get smarter and smarter. A<br>
wordprocessor today know more about writing, formatting and setting up text<br>
than the simple text editors of yesteryear. The Wordproccesor isn't<br>
sentient and it can't create ideas and content. It doesn't have to.<br>
<p>
There already exists software today that can help writers to write<br>
moviescripts by analysing the writers ideas (by means of questions) and<br>
then put them into a movie structure format. They are then able to point<br>
out weak spots in the basic idea of the script. Contradictions in terms<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
This can be called a 3. generation text editor. It knows more about making<br>
moviescripts than the wordprocessor. (including how to format a pro<br>
moviescript.)<br>
<p>
Software consantly keeps getting smarter and is learning all the time. This<br>
feels like an evolution right now because the progress still is rather<br>
slow. And of course the knowledge is hand feed from humans.<br>
<p>
My idea for reaching the Singularity is then: If we keep building better<br>
tools for humans to use to make better tools to make better tools .... you<br>
know. Recursive stuff. Then we would finally have a software tool where all<br>
we have to input is new ideas and a vague notion about how it is done. The<br>
tool could then do the rest or we could experiment until we had it right.<br>
<p>
I have programmed a bit in c++ and i hated every moment of it. That<br>
language is very powerfull but the interface is really really bad.<br>
<p>
There's a new multimedia tool out now that builds on the object oriented<br>
principle as well that is called mTropolis. <a href="http://www.mfactory.com">http://www.mfactory.com</a> It is<br>
really powerfull but won't quite fit as a tool to make tools. It is a<br>
multimedia development tool and very efficient as such. It has a graphic<br>
metaphor that makes true object oriented programming seem very simple.<br>
(Learned in a day or less.)<br>
<p>
What we need is a development tool with the power of something like c++ or<br>
Java combined with the ease of use of something like mTropolis. The tool<br>
should have an emphasis on being extensible in a way that would make it<br>
easy to use it to make new and improved tools with.<br>
<p>
When we have that we will develop new tools to develop new tools with.<br>
<p>
Something like c++ really doesn't make it a lot easier to make new<br>
languages with. It doesn't know enough about computers, Computer-languages<br>
and operating systems. It is implicit in the language that the programmer<br>
must know it all to use for making next gen tools.<br>
<p>
That is what i think is an original idea here. That the software should<br>
"know" something about what it's supposed to be used for in the next<br>
generations. It must be designed to be a tool to make tools with.<br>
<p>
The problem then will not be to make an AI but to make a simple interface<br>
design. The humans will keep controll and decide the route of the<br>
development. Of course a system design tool like that would probably be<br>
great to use for developing an AI with. :)<br>
<p>
Does this sound like nonsens?<br>
