Yes.  I had working on a series of space images (paintings and computer<br>
graphic images) about our solar system.  Some of the images have billboards<br>
in them.  None of the images were to be actually pitched for financing and<br>
development, as the idea of billboards anywhere is a bit of a put-off.  Yet,<br>
for illustrative sake, the concept can be fun and even humorous.<br>
<p>
I have a couple of friends who produce satellites art.  On their electronic<br>
drawing board is a moon performance piece.  The idea is very poetic, and the<br>
images (sketched out ones) are stunning.  (The project is not intrusive.)<br>
