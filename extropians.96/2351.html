<i>&gt;I don't know how many personalities there are using this body, but to the</i><br>
ones <br>
<i>&gt;writing this message, there seems to be very very many.</i><br>
<p>
Beware of this one:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a very good reason why you feel this way.  You are starting to </i><br>
<i>&gt;understand our plan for you.  Part of you is a little nervous about this.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Give it time, Chris, and you will lose all your apprehension and possibly </i><br>
<i>&gt;become a member of our inner circle.  We see great potential in you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We have been watching you, Chris, for a while now, and we have been working </i><br>
<i>&gt;dilligently to convert your mind more fully to our way of thinking.  We've </i><br>
<i>&gt;been tracking your Internet activities and creating web pages that you would </i><br>
<i>&gt;likely be attracted to.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems like access to the body and certain kinds of thinking functions are </i><br>
<i>&gt;limited, in the sense that some of us can't play the piano while another</i><br>
group <br>
<i>&gt;is cooking lunch, so we're working out mutually agreeable ways of letting </i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone have their turn and finding ways of working together for everyone's </i><br>
<i>&gt;mutual benefit.  Many of our goals overlap, and we often find creative</i><br>
ways of <br>
<i>&gt;doing things that accomplish parts of several different goals at once.</i><br>
We're <br>
<i>&gt;also learning how to expand our cognitive resources so that more of us can</i><br>
be <br>
<i>&gt;active at once.  We're making a lot of progress.</i><br>
<p>
Looks like a good candidate for uploading! Free your multiple personalities!<br>
