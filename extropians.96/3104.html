This sounds sorta sick but couldn't you terraform deserts by dumping tons<br>
of raw sewage out there and have it cover the desert for miles and create a<br>
thick layer of topsoil?<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That's been an idea since at least the '50s.  There are a lot of <br>
problems with it; even if you could craft a soil-substitute out of <br>
mixed waste and sand, sand's drainage is "too good" and it shifts too <br>
much. Real soil is (a) complicated matter. And if you don't have the <br>
right climate and hydrology to back it up, it doesn't develop turf <br>
the way grasslands, savannahs or (somewhat misnamed) barrens do.<br>
If you just dump the muck there, all you get is mucky sand until the <br>
first few rainstorms--then you get the sand back and (maybe) some <br>
muck many feet down. Now if you had a magic device that could <br>
transform the sand into clay...  Hmm, I think I hear the n-word <br>
police coming... :)<br>
