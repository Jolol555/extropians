Kurt Rongey:<br>
It would seem that the Christian attitude toward goals is that "I'll do<br>
it <br>
through the grace of God, if it is His will."  What this accomplishes<br>
for <br>
the aspiring olympic runner is eradication of any need to acknowledge<br>
the<br>
possibility of failure.  "God will be there no matter what happens, and <br>
all I have to do is work hard and he'll take care of the rest."  This is <br>
especially true of people operating to fulfill the potential of a<br>
genetic <br>
(read God-given) "talent",  as one finds with olympic athletes.<br>
<p>
This kind of motivational abandon seems on the surface incompatible with<br>
any belief system that restricts itself to reason.  In addition, I think <br>
that the Extropian mainstream view of "certainty" is not a positive<br>
one.  <br>
All is theoretical, and theories are subject to alteration due to <br>
differing experimental results.<br>
<p>
Do we have to abandon reason in order to abandon uncertainty?  If so,<br>
does<br>
a rational philosophy hamper achievement?<br>
<p>
I'm interested to know what techniques people have used to free <br>
themselves from the thought of failure without "divine assistance," and <br>
thereby achieved extraordinary goals.  Anybody have any favorite <br>
techniques?  The faith-in-God one works pretty well.  Too bad there's no <br>
God.<br>
