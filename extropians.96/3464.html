Conservation of momentum is a very well established physical law.<br>
Conservation of energy can be a little trickier: you can have various<br>
forms of energy, kinetic, chemical, heat, potential.  It can be hard to<br>
account for where the energy is in a system and therefore hard to tell<br>
if a system is really conserving energy.  Look at all the controversy<br>
over whether the cold fusion experiments are producing more (non-nuclear)<br>
energy than they are consuming.<br>
<p>
But conservation of momentum is a lot easier to understand.  Unless you<br>
are dealing with relativistic velocities, or really overwhelmingly huge<br>
energy densities, the momentum is just a matter of multiplying each moving<br>
mass by its velocity, and adding all those up.<br>
<p>
Conservation of momentum and the other laws of physics are the basis for<br>
our entire technological civilization.  If these laws were not reliable<br>
bridges would not stand, rockets would not make it to the moon, machinery<br>
would not operate.  Centuries of careful testing and measurements have<br>
only confirmed the accuracy of momentum conservation in all physical<br>
systems.  This is not just approximate conservation, this is perfect<br>
conservation to the finest limits of accuracy available.<br>
<p>
The notion that you are going to be able to come up with a<br>
mechanical system which arranges moving weights "just so" and leads to<br>
non-conservation of momentum is just so terribly unlikely as not to be<br>
worth seriously considering.<br>
