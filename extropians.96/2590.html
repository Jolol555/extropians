snip about uploads being or not being John Clark: <br>
<p>
...and insists that he is indeed me.  As good as this evidence is, I admit it<br>
<p>
falls short of a proof. You will NEVER be able to prove that my upload, <br>
fast or slow, has my consciousness, but then, you can't even prove I had <br>
consciousness before the upload, ( etc)<br>
<p>
This thread seems like a conundrum:  awhile ago we <br>
had a thread about language that followed the spiral<br>
in a different light. It is the reason we developed<br>
symbolic systems to communicate our experience. <br>
We cannot ever really  validate another creature's consciousness or "mind."<br>
