Aw come on, I am talking about the period from 1980's to end 1990's. In <br>
this period, I've seen the Scandinavian model going down the drain. Quite <br>
recently, Krautland has started reducing welfare state quite noticeably. <br>
Afaik, U.S. has not started such a (redistribution) programme, au <br>
contraire. The numbers &amp; growth trend of the unhomed are not exactly<br>
exalting, imo.<br>

Well, I am not an extropian. I've been labeled as such by others, though.<br>
I said about an equidistribution _trend_, I never proposed actual<br>
equidistribution for target. That would be communism, and I've seen what <br>
even socialism can do, having lived in the heart of Commieland for 14 <br>
years.<br>

Providing basic bread (+butter) &amp; games (brown ware) for the masses <br>
would keep them from raising an insurrection "against those rich above". <br>
I don't know how you see it, but I doubt a civil war can be fun.<br>

Guns were outlawed there. Nevertheless look at all the NRA activities, <br>
neighbourhood watches &amp; whatever. At the very least we don't get shot by <br>
mistake in Krautland at license controls if you take your hands off the <br>
steering wheel &amp; most European cities are arguably safe, imo. I am not sure <br>
that guns are a Good Thing, anymore (yeah, I've read Vinge &amp; liked him).<br>
