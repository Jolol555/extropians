Max, aren't you therefore defining 'spontaneous order' on the basis of the<br>
Extropian desirability of both the order and the process of achieving that<br>
order? I, like you, am not sure that the process leading to central<br>
government is one of spontaneous order, but if it _were_, how could we then<br>
say that the result was not spontaneous order, merely because we didn't<br>
agree with the nature of that order, or the way it was reached? The phrase<br>
'spontaneous order' doesn't lend itself to such value judgements.<br>
