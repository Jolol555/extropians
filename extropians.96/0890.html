Quantum computers are alluring but nobody has built one yet and until very  <br>
recently the only useful program known to be able to run on these machines <br>
was one to factor large numbers for code breaking. Unfortunately there are <br>
problems, to factor a 100 digit number the machine would need to perform <br>
millions of quantum logical operations without being effected by the outside<br>
environment, even with the newly discovered quantum error correcting codes <br>
that would not be easy to do, not for that many operations. In the August 23 <br>
1996  Science is a fascinating research article by Seth Lloyd called <br>
"Universal  Quantum Simulators". Lloyd has found a way for quantum computers <br>
to do something far, FAR, more useful than factoring numbers, and is much <br>
easier for the machines to do too.<br>
                <br>
In quantum mechanics it's often possible in theory to predict what something  <br>
will do but not in practice because of computational complexity, that's why <br>
Chemists must still perform experiments. To simulate the behavior of N <br>
electrons, in a conventional computer you would need memory space and <br>
computation time proportional to 2^2N. Just to figure out what's going on with <br>
40 electrons, like those found in a medium sized  atom, you would need to <br>
perform 10^24 operations. It's no wonder that Chemists keep their test tubes.<br>
 <br>
Lloyd found a way to perform the same simulation using just N quantum bits <br>
(qubits) and the number of operations the quantum machine  must do is  <br>
proportional to N, not 2^2N as on a conventional computer. In addition, the <br>
time required to do the simulation over time t is proportional to t, in other <br>
words it can do it in real time, like a Analog computer. A very important<br>
feature of Lloyd's algorithm is that it doesn't demand that the Quantum <br>
computer be a perfect machine that is totally isolated from the environment, <br>
it easily deals with errors. Incredibly, noise from the environment and <br>
decoherence can be useful to the computer, it can actually help it simulate <br>
noise and decoherence in the system it's simulating.<br>
 <br>
This may help put a stop to all the "End Of Science" books we've been seeing <br>
lately. People were saying that it was a waste of time to try to find a <br>
quantum theory of gravity because there would be no way to test it. It would  <br>
be a HUGE calculation, but a thousand qubit quantum computer could do it.  <br>
Lloyd says we could make a Quantum Computer today with a few tens of qubits<br>
and it would "require only minor modifications of current technology". <br>
I'd say that's a pretty good start. He also says "The wide variety of atomic, <br>
molecular, and semiconductor quantum devices available suggests that quantum <br>
simulation may soon be a reality".<br>
 <br>
In a separate development, Lov K Grover of ATT recently found a way for a  <br>
Quantum Computer to find a piece of information in a random list with N items <br>
in just the square root of N steps, not 1/2 N steps, which is the  average if <br>
you do this on a conventional computer.<br>
