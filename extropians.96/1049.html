FREE CASH REALLY WORKS!<br>
<pre>
-- 
<p>
Taking 5 minutes to read this text may be one of the best decisions 
you ever made!
<p>
My name is not important. What is important is what happened to me. In 
December 1994, my business went bankrupt because of the poorstate of 
the economy. My cars were repossessed and debt collectors were 
hounding me like you would not believe. I owed thousands and 
bankruptcy seemed to be my only future. My family, my reputation, my 
sanity and my life was at stake. I became very ill. On 9 January 1995, 
<p>
I saw an article in an Internet Newsgroup telling me I could make 
$50,000 within 4 weeks for an investment of only $5. I thought it was 
a huge joke! I spoke to my attorney and friends about it and they 
thought likewise.  But after three days of desperate struggle in court 
to keep from going bankrupt, I decided I had nothing to lose. My 
family and I in desperation, grasped at straws and sent $1 by email mail
to each of 5 
names and addresses specified in the article. We then placed our own 
name and address in the article and posted it in 200 other newsgroups.  
<p>
Two weeks later, I started receiving money in the mail! I could not 
believe it! Hundreds of dollars turned into thousands, and in the 4 
weeks, I received a total of $57,883. It came from all over the world.  
If you follow the 3 steps below, there is no reason whatsoever why the 
same shouldn't happen to you. This is a perfectly legitimate 
investment opportunity. You invest $5 and you receive a return on your 
investment. So does the next investor.
<p>
NOT ILLEGAL, NOT A CHAIN LETTER - PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE! 
OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED, THEN DON'T 
PARTICIPATE. BUT PLEASE PRINT THIS ARTICLE AND GIVE IT TO 
SOMEONE WHO MAY WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 
<p>
The procedure is very simple:
<p>
STEP 1. Write your name and address on 5 separate pieces of paper with 
the words "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST". Fold a $1 note or 
moneyorder or bank draft in each of the pieces of paper and mail them 
to the following five addresses:
<p>
1. TOM BYRNE, P.O.Box 157A, BELMONT,WI,53510-0157 USA
2. AMY LEVIN, 947 ROBIN LA, HUNTINGDON VALLEY, PA, 19006 USA
3. ERIC TURCOTTE, 428 MOFFAT AVENUE, VERDUN, QC. H4H 1Y5     CANADA 
4. ROXANNE HOWLETT, 65 HAYWARD AVE., APT#1, ST. JOHN"S NF.,     A1C 3W6, CANADA.
5. MANAGER, 40 HELMS HILL RD., WASHINGTONVILLE, NY, 10992-2028, USA.
<p>
STEP 2. Now remove the 1st name on the list, move the other 4 names 
up(5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3 etc) and put your name and address as 
number 5 on the list. You can do this by re-typing this article or 
simply editing and re-posting it in this or another newsgroup.
<p>
STEP 3. Post your amended article to at least 200 new groups (there are 
17,000 of them).You are now in the Mail Order Investment Business and 
you will start receiving $1 returns by mail within a week or two. The 
more newsgroups you post to, the bigger your return will be. You may 
want to rent a PostOffice Box to handle the volume of mail you are 
likely to receive. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can use a 
pseudonym such as"The Manager" or "The Investor", but make sure your 
address is correct!
<p>
NOW LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS! 
Of every 200 postings I made, I received an average of 5 replies, 
YES -ONLY 5, each with a $1 bill enclosed. You make $5 for every 
200 postings WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 5. Each person 
who sent you $1, now also makes let's say,only 
200 additional postings WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 4, i.e. 1000 
postings. On average therefore, 50 people will send you $1 with your 
name at number 4. You make $50.Your 50 new agents make 200 posting 
each WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 3or 10 000 postings - average return 500 
at $1 each is $500. They make 200 postings each WITH YOUR NAME AT 
NUMBER 2 = 100,000 postings= 5,000 returns at $1 each = $5,000.
Finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings each WITH YOUR NAME AT NUMBER 
1 and you get a return of $50,000 before you name drops off the list. 
AND THAT'S IF EVERYONE DOWN THE LINE ONLY MAKES 200 POSTINGS! Total 
income in one cycle = $55,500. From time to time, when your name is no 
longer on the list, you take the latest posting that is appearing in 
the newsgroups, SEND OUT ANOTHER $5 TO THE NAMES THAT ARE ON THE LIST, 
PUT YOUR NAME IN AT NUMBER 5 AND START POSTING AGAIN. Remember, 200 
postings is only a guideline. The more you post, the greater the 
return. Let's review the reasons why you should do this: THE ONLY COST 
FACTORS ARE 5 STAMPS, 5 ENVELOPES, AND 5 $1 BILLS. Anyone can afford 
five dollars to put into such an effortless investment with 
SPECTACULAR RETURNS.
Some people have said to me "What happens if the 
scheme is 'played out' and no one sends me any money"? Big deal! So 
you lose $5 - but what are the chances of that happening? Do you 
realize how many Internet Users there are? Do you realize how many 
times this scheme can be utilized over and over again - with 
COMPLETELY NEW people participating? There are not HUNDREDS, NOT EVEN 
THOUSANDS, BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW INTERNET USERS EVERY 
MONTH! Remember, read the instructions carefully and play 
FAIRLY...that's the only way this will work. Get a printout so you can 
refer back to this article easily.Try to keep a list of everyone that 
sends you money and always keep an eye on the newsgroup postings to 
make sure everyone is playing fairly. You know where your name should 
be.
<p>
REMEMBER - HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. ENJOY!
