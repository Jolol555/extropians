Banjo offered this dare to Michael Lorrey:  "ok, i dare you to *choose* to be <br>
a multi-billionaire."<br>
<p>
I will take the dare.  It will take a lot of hard work, and I will have to <br>
learn to satisfy the desires of many many people, and I will have to learn how <br>
to be very creative and ingenious and make the most out of all my resources, <br>
but I am confident that I can do it.  I am pretty sure I can create that much <br>
wealth (and I mean literally, to CREATE it).  I'm planning on creating so much <br>
wealth that I will have lots to share, to help poor people everywhere, to <br>
teach them how to create their own wealth.  The creation of wealth benefits <br>
everyone, and so it will benefit me to teach lots of others how to create <br>
wealth for themselves (then there will be more people creating high-quality <br>
products for me to trade with).  The only way we can all be wealthy is if <br>
everyone learns to create their own wealth.  It won't happen by redistributing <br>
the wealth that some create to those who don't create wealth.  Everyone must <br>
take responsibility for their own lives and use the resources they have to add <br>
value to everything they can.  That is how we create wealth.<br>
