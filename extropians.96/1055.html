IAN: Of course the missile theory sounds like "anti-gravity" <br>
experiments, because, like anti-gravity, everybody knows that <br>
missiles could never fly across the sky, much less hit a plane <br>
-- why it's patently absurd.<br>
<p>
It seems that over 100 crazy people had a spontaneous group <br>
hallucination in New York on the night the plane went boom.<br>
The Washington Times (07/24/96) reported about these crazies:<br>
<p>
        Several eyewitnesses, including an Air National <br>
        Guard pilot flying in the area when the explosion <br>
        occurred, have told the FBI they saw a bright, <br>
        flare-like object streaking toward the jumbo jet <br>
        seconds before it blew up. ABC News said yesterday <br>
        that the investigators had more then  100  eyewitness <br>
        accounts supporting the theory.       ^^^<br>
<p>
Can you imagine that, 100 crazy conspiratorial people attacking <br>
the truth-meme, which is that missiles can't fly or hit planes.<br>
<p>
What is more, there is a bad conspiratorial radar out there that <br>
is also a dangerous threat to the truth-meme:<br>
<p>
      Associated Press 07/19/96<br>
<p>
         There were reports that radar detected a blip <br>
         merging with the jet shortly before the explosion, <br>
         something that could indicate a missile hit. <br>
<p>
Thank the truth-meme that some secret pentagon officials stopped the<br>
testimony of that conspiratorial radar -- the AP story continues:<br>
<p>
         But Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of <br>
         anonymity, said government analysts have studied <br>
         several radar reports of the area and the blip <br>
         was found to be a spurious signal.<br>
<p>
I am glad we can rely on our secret govt agents to stand up for <br>
truth when those bad "spurious" radars and witnesses get out of <br>
hand and threaten the truth-meme.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>  &gt;If true (I mean the missile story) it would be terrible news for</i><br>
<i>  &gt;</i><br>
<i>  &gt;extropians,  because it would suggest that the truth is a very weak meme.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Wow, this sort of says it all: If the missile theory is true,<br>
then the truth-meme is weak. So it's preordained that there can only <br>
be one variety of truth even if it's false, and that truth must be<br>
that the a missile could never have hit TWA flight 800.<br>
<p>
I'd say this line of reasoning is a threat to the truth. The only<br>
"truth meme" is logical thinking. The only truth is what is.<br>
