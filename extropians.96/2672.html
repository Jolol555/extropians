<i>&gt;Also, the dominant form of biological life will be based on carbon, like</i><br>
<i>&gt;we are. THe next best element as a replacement is silicon, has less than</i><br>
<i>&gt;50% of the versatility chemically as carbon, so is less likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;used. However, DNA may not neccessarily be the form of building bioware.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A star with a bit too much ultraviolet light output would simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;scramble DNA too much to be of use, unless you had an environment like</i><br>
<i>&gt;Seven Day Planet where massive reproduction, high metabolic rates, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;high rates of evolution would be the norm.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps creation or discovery of a silicon-based lifeform would be a large<br>
step toward uploading because a silicon based lifeform would possibly be<br>
more versatile than a carbon based one due to the complexity of the genetic<br>
architecture needed to support it. Some of the most successful organisms<br>
grow where the fewest resources exist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;i read a recent study of</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely forms of intelligent aliens. According to the analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary behavior, the humanoid form is the most likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligent, though not necessarily mammalian or even human features,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the bipedal, two eyes and ears, two to four arms, and four to six</i><br>
<i>&gt;fingered hand, who is omnivorous. Of course,this is based on an expected</i><br>
<i>&gt;limited database of how much we think we know about our world, and how</i><br>
<i>&gt;little we know about others.</i><br>
<p>
Do you remember what the publication was? I'd be interested to read it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd still like to see more people get intelligence amplification enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;so that I can converse with anyone as easily as most of you guys.</i><br>
<p>
If the mnumonic trick of the hypertext structure of the web is as powerful<br>
as is being suggested, the web may educate the masses into an intelligent<br>
race. oh no!<br>
