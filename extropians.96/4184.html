Which phylum do you owe your allegiance to, your genes or your memes? If<br>
you are "loyal" to the genes, saving "weak" people might be wrong (but as<br>
others have pointed out, in our modern environment many "weak" genes do<br>
not decrease fitness anyway). If you are loyal to the memes, then it was<br>
definitely a good thing, since that person will continue to think and<br>
communicate despite his genetic effect. <br>
<p>
Evolution isn't good in itself, but by interacting with it we can turn it<br>
to a good force (as determined by our values). <br>
