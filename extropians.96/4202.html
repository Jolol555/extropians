<i>&gt; Minor Digression:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What I find interesting, is that I have found out (over the last year </i><br>
<i>&gt; or so) that I can exert a phenomenal amount of control over my body </i><br>
<i>&gt; and mind by force of will alone.  </i><br>
<p>
This is kind of like saying Archimedes made a minor little digression <br>
and discovered the principle of leverage.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was prompted to look into this by something that I have been able </i><br>
<i>&gt; to do for years, and that is operate without an alarm clock.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Before I go tosleep, I tell myself what time I want to wake up.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Almost without fail (it doesn't always work if I am really exhausted), </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wake up within two minutes of the time I wanted to wake up.  </i><br>
<p>
Ok.  I can do that.  But the next step -- <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Currently I can drop my heart rate by about 20 pulses per minute </i><br>
<i>&gt; and raise it about 40 pulses per minute almost immediately simply by </i><br>
<i>&gt; "making it so".  When I first tried doing this, I had a difficult time</i><br>
<i>&gt; making my heart rate change at all, but with practice, I found that </i><br>
<i>&gt; I could do it both quickly and fairly dramatically.  I have tried this </i><br>
<i>&gt; with a lot of other biological functions such as body temperature, </i><br>
<i>&gt; metabolism, and many other metrics and have had significant </i><br>
<i>&gt; success.  </i><br>
<p>
is a mystery.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The key to doing this, for me, was the subtle differences between </i><br>
<i>&gt; "hoping something will happen", "seeing if something will happen", </i><br>
<i>&gt; and "making something happen".  The key is to simply "make it </i><br>
<i>&gt; happen" under the assumption that you can already do it.  Its as if </i><br>
<i>&gt; your body won't let your mind take control unless your mind actually </i><br>
<i>&gt; knows that it can.  Its not as if you should be "requesting" these </i><br>
<i>&gt; things, because you already own them but just aren't aware of it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; And with regular practice, it becomes easier to do.  </i><br>
<p>
There is a chicken-and-egg problem here.  If I had already done it, then <br>
I would "actually know" that I can.  But the first time -- ?   How do you <br>
start?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Historically, people have been aware that it is possible to have </i><br>
<i>&gt;a great deal of control over mind and body simply by the mechanism </i><br>
<i>&gt; of suggestion.  I am seeking a way of actively harnessing this </i><br>
<i>&gt; elusive interface to my own advantage.  </i><br>
<p>
This is IA at its best.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Who knows, maybe I will write about it someday.</i><br>
<p>
I hope so.  <br>
