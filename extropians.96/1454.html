On Sunday, September 29, 1996 3:44PM Robin Hanson wrote:<br>
"I wrote to Sarah privately, saying: I think this is a mistake.  I often<br>
don't reply to things I disagree with.  Replying depends on having time,<br>
thinking the other discussants are worth talking with, and thinking<br>
email is a good forum for that sort of discussion."<br>
<p>
Robin adds:<br>
"The quality of a mailing list is a fragile thing.  If just takes a few<br>
"bad apples" willing to post enough junk, and then people will stop<br>
bothering to post a reply to every post they think is below par.  And it<br>
goes down from there."<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what is included in your definition of quality.  You imply<br>
that posting 'junk' will spoil a mailing list.  But, as you point out,<br>
the 'junk' can be ignored if it's not on your personal list of<br>
priorities.  Far more fragile is the quality of civil discourse, which<br>
(IMO) Reilly Jones has more seriously violated with his slurs about<br>
"imbecility" and "conceptual drivel" and, less seriously, with his<br>
apparent notion that anyone who speaks must do so with 100% certainty.<br>
<p>
I really hope we don't poison this list by classifying people as<br>
'nihilists' and 'imbeciles', nor condemn their ideas as 'conceptual<br>
drivel' just because their thinking may be 'muddled' in some areas, or<br>
their terms were ambiguous and their ideas may have been poorly<br>
presented.<br>
<p>
I ALSO REALLY HOPE THAT REILLY STICKS AROUND BECAUSE I THINK HE OFFERS<br>
ALOT OF USEFUL INSIGHTS, OFTEN FROM A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.<br>
<p>
When I said that Sarah's initial response to Reilly's initial post was<br>
"incisive", I meant two things simultaneously: (1) It really 'ripped'<br>
Reilly's post apart (perhaps a little too intensively, and he responded<br>
in kind); and, (2) It was sharp and to the point in some instances.  I<br>
used "incisive" in an ambiguous way. Does that qualify my statement as<br>
'junk'? Should there be no subjectivity allowed on this list?<br>
<p>
I am guilty of posting some 'junk' myself recently (mostly by improperly<br>
using terms I'm still learning about, like 'ontology' and 'Markov<br>
processes', in an ambiguous way or incomplete way), but as Sarah points<br>
out:<br>
"I had a short discussion ... which showed me flaws in my thinking and<br>
allowed me to revise my ideas ... I'd hate to think I might have missed<br>
that chance."<br>
<p>
The Socratic method of the mailing list is a good place to learn and<br>
clear up some confusion.  But every utterance shouldn't need to adhere<br>
to strict scientific methods of experimentation, or formal logic, or<br>
mathematical proof.  Neither should every utterance need to be<br>
challenged - there should be some room for humor &amp; banter.<br>
<p>
Robin concludes:<br>
"I think the net is in great need of some innovate alternatives to the<br>
stark alternatives of open vs. moderated lists.  One idea I've played<br>
with is a list pair, one open and one closed (to posting, but readable<br>
by all).  To apply for membership in the closed list, you submit five of<br>
your recent posts to the open list, which are forwarded to three random<br>
closed list members for consideration."<br>
<p>
So, for example, the closed list might contain your "Great Filter"<br>
essay, but not all the rambling discussion of it that took place on the<br>
open list.  This seems like a nice idea, more like an official journal<br>
than a debating forum though.  Given limited list management resources,<br>
however, it seems somewhat unnecessary to me - intelligent participants<br>
can determine for themselves what posts contain significant ideas and<br>
which are less formal or more conversational, or just items that *might*<br>
be of interest to some.<br>
<p>
Robin ends with:<br>
"It is important to have a common sense of what some community is<br>
seeing."<br>
<p>
Would the 'authorities' on the closed list be obliged to consider all<br>
sides of a debate?  If the community consists of all who participate in<br>
the open list, can there be a "common sense" of what 'the community' is<br>
seeing other than through the full and open forum?<br>
