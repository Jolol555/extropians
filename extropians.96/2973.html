<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;experienced. What is left?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A missile would leave significant residue traces if it impacted on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; plane.  If the missile was proximity fused, it would leave a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; identifiable signature on parts of the plane due to the nature of proximity</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; detonations.  Since it has not been mentioned anywhere, I will assume that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; proximity detonating missile did not bring down the plane.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The Navy's Standard missile (presumably the one used this scenario) most</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; likely uses a large composite warhead of RDX and TNT, both of which leave</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; significant chemical traces, especially TNT.  However, no significant traces</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; have been found of any explosive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Essentially all military explosives are detectable both by explosive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; detection hardware (like TNC) and residue traces.  Therefore, assuming that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the facts available are correct and true, then military explosives are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; involved.  This would significantly lessen the possibility that the military</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; was directly involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; HYPOTHESIS:  There are much lesser known classes of explosives which 1) are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not detectable via normal explosive detection hardware, and 2) do not leave</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; chemical traces normally associated with explosives.  This would force the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; general requirement that the explosive was loaded on to the plane, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; delivered by missile.  This would also generally show significant intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; since these explosives would require custom manufacture by a knowledgeable</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; explosive chemist.  In turn, this would imply a bit more intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; resourcefulness than your average terrorist.  If you suspect the government,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Sandia NL could easily produce the required compounds.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, there is an anti air missile with very little explosive. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sea Sparrow uses a warhead with a proximity fuse which is little more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than a very tightly coiled spiral spring (like in clocks). This sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;device would explode outside the plane, far enough to eliminate any</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility of residue showing up on the plane peices, and would simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;slice into the body of the aircraft. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In this scenario, since the Sea Sparrow is a radar guided missile, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would hit a plane amidships, where the return radar signal is greatest</i><br>
<i>&gt;(right where the explosion happened), already "sprung", and would slice</i><br>
<i>&gt;into the fuel tank so violently that an explosion would result from</i><br>
<i>&gt;ignited fumes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
How do you define very little explosive?  With the Sea Sparrow, you are<br>
looking at about 35 kilos of military high explosive.  Compare this to the<br>
fact that most airline terrorist incidents are accomplished with less than 1<br>
kilo.<br>
<p>
True, a proximity detonation would leave little residue, but as I mentioned<br>
above, proximity-fused missiles leave very distinct damage signatures on<br>
aircraft.  A person familiar with missile damage could identify what type of<br>
missile and warhead was used simply from the visible damage to the aircraft.<br>
This type of damage would have been immediately apparent on the fuselage.<br>
Even to someone who wasn't familiar with missile damage, it would have been<br>
readily apparent that something unusual happened to the fuselage from the<br>
outside.<br>
<p>
Assuming the plane was shot down by a missile launched from a boat *other*<br>
than a Navy one also generates some difficulties.  The missile capabilities<br>
required to shoot down the jet in the given conditions requires an<br>
intermediate range missile.  A shoulder-launched weapon has neither the<br>
range nor the capability required.  Your average intermediate range<br>
anti-aircraft missile is pretty large (3-5 meters long) and usually weighs<br>
between 400-800 pounds.  Add to this the fairly bulky launching equipment,<br>
and the requirements for a launch platform get pretty large.  Most<br>
low-intermediate range anti-aircraft missiles use passive or semi-active<br>
radar (such as the Sea Sparrow).  This requires that someone is guiding the<br>
missile to the target using anti-aircraft radar equipment.  The bottom line<br>
is that for someone else *other* than the Navy to use such a missile system<br>
would mean some SERIOUS ship retrofitting and hardware acquisitions.  I<br>
imagine it is pretty difficult to purchase an anti-aircraft radar system<br>
over-the-counter, never mind the launcher and missiles.  <br>
<p>
The alternative, although less likely, is infrared-guided missiles.<br>
Infrared guided missiles require significantly less supporting hardware.<br>
However, infrared-guided missiles would have caused severe mechanical damage<br>
to the engines.  No damage of this type was found.<br>
<p>
Despite "eye witnesses", I still have serious problems with the missile<br>
theory based on the evidence given.  However, if a missile is required, the<br>
Navy would be the only real viable source.<br>
