<i>&gt;A good post from Chris Hind, but I do disagree with one thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;The way I wish to be uploaded will be through gradual</i><br>
           <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;incremental uploading so that "I" will be the uploaded,</i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;virtual, digital, being rather than a digital duplicate</i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;running around as me. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A gradual upload might be a good idea for practical reasons, you could catch </i><br>
<i>&gt;any bugs in the procedure before they caused serious harm, but I don't see </i><br>
<i>&gt;how it would make any difference from a philosophical viewpoint. Since all </i><br>
<i>&gt;the atoms in our bodies are constantly changing and information is the thing </i><br>
<i>&gt;that makes me be me and you be you, I don't think it's meaningful to </i><br>
<i>&gt;differentiate between a "copy" and the "original" of a person. Are copies of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Windows 95 inferior to the "original", whatever that means?</i><br>
<p>
I do not care about the 'me' other people see, I only care about the 'me' I<br>
am currently experiencing. Perhaps the answers to uploading are in the<br>
subconscious? or perhaps uploading to silicon isn't possibly without<br>
turning the person into an 'emulation' of an individual. Emulations are not<br>
as good as the real thing you know because they're fakes. Perhaps we will<br>
be forced to upload to 'super meat brains' which have been genetically<br>
engineered to have MUCH MORE processing power and storage. We would also<br>
build a super number cruncher coprocessor into it so that we would make up<br>
for the human brains lack of numeric processing power. Also maybe uploading<br>
will look like psychodelia because putting someone on acid during an upload<br>
would be firing neurons all over the place and in areas usually not fired<br>
which would be a great way to check to make sure all the neuron pathways<br>
were in place and duplicated correctly.<br>
