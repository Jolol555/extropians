<i>&gt;Absolutely! But taking our own scarcity along won't get us far.</i><br>
<i>&gt;We certainly need a lot of diverse, life sustaining  technology. And all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rest of the bag of tricks we can muster to keep us alive on an offworld</i><br>
<i>&gt;colony.</i><br>

I am REALLY looking forward to the upcoming probe missions to Mars stirred<br>
up by the possibility that microbial life may still exist in isolated<br>
places on Mars. Did you see this month's Scientific American? It has<br>
incredible computer-generated photos of how Mars would've looked like in<br>
it's warm oceanic youth. Wednesday er, tomorrow the first of the probes<br>
will launch carrying 80% of the science carried aboard the failed Mars<br>
Observer. I wonder if Eric Paulos from Berkeley have thought of using their<br>
'web blimps' as rovers on Mars to explore the terrain? I have seen no<br>
meantion of this on their website. Check out their concept of telepresence<br>

<i>&gt;I dont think it's going to be like in Star Trek where all the planets</i><br>
<i>&gt;have air we can breathe and humanoids who speak English 100% ; - ) </i><br>

Ahh. But you forgot about the universal translator which can keep all lips<br>
in sync. :)<br>
