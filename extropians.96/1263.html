 First Announcement and Call for Papers<br>
<p>
Harvard University is hosting this symposium to broaden and deepen<br>
understanding of emerging economic and business models for<br>
global publishing and information access and the attendant<br>
transformation of international information markets, institutions, and<br>
businesses. The goal is to provide managers in public, private, and<br>
nonprofit sectors with a practical framework for developing<br>
program strategies and assessing the efficiency and competitiveness of<br>
new information markets and institutions. It will address<br>
questions such as:<br>
<p>
--What will be the principal pricing models for information in an<br>
advanced global Internet?<br>
<p>
-- How will pricing models be affected by different technological<br>
factors and market environments?<br>
<p>
-- What will be the relationships between classic production costs,<br>
transaction costs, and the economic value of intellectual<br>
property?<br>
<p>
-- How will different pricing practices at lower layers affect the<br>
pricing of information?<br>
<p>
-- What are likely long-term trends and scenarios for different pricing<br>
models? What will be the effect of bundling or unbundling of<br>
information services?<br>
<p>
-- How will changing cost structures change the allocation of rights<br>
between authors and publishers and other intermediaries?<br>
<p>
-- How will markets for complementary products and services affect the<br>
pricing and use of information?<br>
<p>
-- What are the policy implications of different pricing models?<br>
<p>
-- How do these reflect policy values associated with different kinds of<br>
information?<br>
<p>
Background:<br>
<p>
The rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web is trans-<br>
forming the way information is accessed and used in business,<br>
education, and the home. New models for distributing, sharing, linking,<br>
and enhancing information are appearing, often embodied in<br>
software or infrastructure. No change is more dramatic than the shift to<br>
user-initiated retrieval for text-based information<br>
formerly distributed in the form of physical objects by<br>
publisher-initiated manufacturing and delivery. A similar shift may be<br>
underway for sound and video. However, the considerable differences in<br>
bandwidth and storage requirements between text,<br>
images, sound, and video may dictate different cost and pricing models<br>
in the near and mid-term. As production and distribution<br>
costs decline, transaction costs and the value of intellectual property<br>
may assume greater prominence. On the other hand,<br>
standards and software may work to substantially reduce transaction<br>
costs over the long run. With barriers to entry reduced by<br>
technology, information markets may become extremely competitive,<br>
reducing margins and possibly lowering the economic value<br>
of many forms of intellectual property.<br>
<p>
The Internet and the World Wide Web are characterized by explosion of<br>
information along with an explosion of new tools for<br>
navigating information. Competition for attention intensifies as<br>
companies extend their marketing, sales, and support functions into<br>
the Internet. Useful or entertaining information may have greater value<br>
in attracting customer attention in an increasingly<br>
competitive marketplace for information. Accordingly, it has been argued<br>
that information will be valued less as intellectual<br>
property and more in terms of the access it provides to other markets<br>
and the value it adds to relationships. As a practical<br>
matter, copyright may be overshadowed by the growing use of contracts as<br>
a means of both securing value and defining<br>
expectations in continuing relationships. Positions in simple<br>
distribution chains are likely to erode as a result of disintermediation<br>
and intense competition. In particular, reduced production costs and the<br>
desire to avoid residual transaction costs may force<br>
vendors away from complex pricing models. For example, usage-based<br>
pricing may give way to subscription pricing. Such<br>
dynamics may lead to new institutional arrangements for managing<br>
life-cycle costs of information, especially in small markets<br>
where users are also producers.<br>
<p>
Similarly, as production costs decrease, the costs of information may be<br>
assimilated by the underlying infrastructure or assumed<br>
by users. This trend may be seen in the pricing of online services and<br>
in the massive volunteering of content on the World Wide<br>
Web. The Web, including software and servers, enables editorial and<br>
navigation functions traditionally performed by publishers and<br>
libraries to be performed in increased measure by individual authors and<br>
end users. Cost analysis in this environment may hinge on<br>
identification and evaluation of critical bottlenecks -- with the<br>
understanding that many technological limitations may be<br>
short-lived. Congestion may lead to new methods of supplementing<br>
point-to-point transmissions, such as caching, mirroring, and<br>
satellite broadcast. These new mechanisms may raise intellectual<br>
property and interconnection questions that may be addressed<br>
both as business and policy issues. Congestion may also hasten the<br>
implementation of type of service priority at either the network<br>
or server levels. Negotiation over quality and scope of service may<br>
become extremely complex, and vendors may be tempted to<br>
price to as many dimensions of value as possible. However, simple<br>
pricing models may have surprisingly strong appeal, as they<br>
have had in the analog environment. Sequential distribution windows for<br>
motion pictures illustrate the potential for simple price<br>
differentiation in a technologically complex environment. Price<br>
differentiation is now playing an increasingly important role in the<br>
marketing of software and databases. In fact, there may be public policy<br>
arguments for price differentiation, not only for reasons<br>
of efficiency but to enable some of level of access for those who cannot<br>
afford access under standard terms, just as public<br>
libraries have offered access for those who could not afford to buy.<br>

<p>
The Information Infrastructure Project emphasizes communication and<br>
sharing of insight among scholars and practitioners with<br>
different skills and backgrounds. Papers should be written in a clear,<br>
non-technical manner (technical appendices may be<br>
permitted) for a mixed, interdisciplinary audience that will include<br>
publishers, librarians, economists, lawyers, and policy-<br>
makers.<br>
<p>
Prospective authors should submit short abstracts for review and comment<br>
as soon as possible. Extended abstracts or outlines<br>
should be submitted by October 15, 1996, to ensure consideration for the<br>
program. Acceptances of abstracts and outlines are<br>
conditional pending receipt of a satisfactory draft by December 15,<br>
1996. Papers and supplementary material will be published as<br>
a volume in the Project's series with the MIT Press. Copyright<br>
assignment is not required, and parallel publication of individual<br>
papers in journals is encouraged.<br>
