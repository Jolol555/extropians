What if you invented an algorithm which is crucial to the workings of <br>
a very succesfull a-life organism which is set to replace humanity.  <br>
A meme you have created will be immortal, and the father-mother of a <br>
new era in evolution.  Do you want to live on through your genes, or <br>
your memes ?<br>
