Dear Science / Computer Science Site,<br>
<p>
This morning, prominent author and futurist Howard Rheingold launched<br>
ELECTRIC MINDS (<a href="http://www.minds.com">http://www.minds.com</a>), an online destination where <br>
experts<br>
and knowledge seekers gather to share news, analysis and opinion about<br>
technology, science, computers and their affect on peoples' lives. We <br>
are<br>
inviting individuals and users at technology, college and social <br>
computing<br>
sites to participate and share a common vision with us, as developing<br>
community is essential to long-term success of the Web and loyalty and<br>
connection between people is as important as ideas and information. By<br>
balancing content and online conversation, Electric Minds is driving <br>
the<br>
evolution of the Web from a publishing medium into a social medium - <br>
the<br>
Social Web.<br>
<p>
We are *not* just a magazine online - who would care?! We are a living,<br>
breathing, dynamic community where some of the smartest thinkers from<br>
around the Net will come each day to discuss, debate and connect with<br>
ideas, visions and news of our brave new Web world. More than product<br>
reviews or digital fashion, Electric Minds is about meaning and <br>
context.<br>
<p>
Recently, Jerry Michalski of Release 1.0 commented, "Most Web sites <br>
create<br>
content, context or conversations. Few do any worthwhile integration of <br>
all<br>
three elements, and none enrich the combined materials over time, and <br>
turn<br>
them into long-lived resources for use in other media. Electric Minds <br>
is<br>
the first company I have seen that is creating such an environment. <br>
Because<br>
it combines crafted points of view, snappy conversations and links to <br>
other<br>
such conversations across the Net, its system should have broad <br>
appeal."<br>
<p>
As a virtual community, we combine content from high-profile <br>
contributors<br>
with facilitated conversations using Web conferencing systems. <br>
Contributors<br>
for the site include HTML guru Laura Lemay, VRML co-creator Mark Pesce,<br>
former San Francisco Chronicle online commentator Bob Rossney, Virtual<br>
Reality author and Silicon Graphics VR evangelist Linda Jacobson and <br>
many<br>
others of similar repute. Rheingold himself wrote the bestselling book, <br>
The<br>
Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier, which sold<br>
100,000 copies in 6 languages. Furthermore, we are a global family, as <br>
we<br>
have contributors from Japan, Australia, France, Germany, England and<br>
across the US giving street-level reports on technology and digital <br>
culture<br>
as it happens. We are part university, part laboratory, part magazine <br>
and<br>
part thinktank.<br>
<p>
We look forward to your participation, feedback and enthusiasm in our <br>
new<br>
adventure - see you there!<br>
