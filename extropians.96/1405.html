Eric,<br>
<p>
Just to clarify what I said:  I never said that our subjective knowledge was <br>
infalliable.  All I said is that we are certain THAT we are experiencing.  We <br>
are much less certain WHAT we are experiencing.  We may be horribly wrong <br>
about the *content* of our experiences, but the very fact that we are <br>
experiencing something rather than nothing is blatently obvious to each of us. <br>
 That is what I was saying, and that is ALL I was saying.  I don't think that <br>
this re-establishes the subjective/objective dichotomy at all.  <br>
<p>
But, you're right; if I _was_ claiming that we understand our subjective <br>
experiences perfectly, while we can never hope to understand the objective <br>
world perfectly, I _would_have_ been reinstating the objective/subjective <br>
dichotomy that I was busily demolishing.  But I wasn't saying that, you just <br>
thought I was.  So, we don't disagree at all on this point.  Just a simple <br>
misunderstanding.  Now you can write your "me too" post. <br>
