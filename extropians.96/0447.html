It depends on how large the remaining filter is.  And it might well be<br>
that even when one understands the problem, there isn't much we can do<br>
about it.  And hard times are no reason to give up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps, if we became convinced that the great filter is in our</i><br>

<i>&gt;(How would we persuade the masses of the logic of this argument?)</i><br>
 <br>
You'd have a *very* hard time persuading me (mass #2147281593) of this.<br>
