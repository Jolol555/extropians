True but isn't it closer to reality in the fact that we're already<br>
performing genetic therapy on living human beings whereas we haven't even<br>
created the first nanite? Sure, all we need is one nanite to create<br>
quadrillions but we still are only beginning to grasp the concepts that<br>
make nano possible. So perhaps it's a race to see which will bring us<br>
uploading first. I'm betting genetics, you're betting nano. This is sorta<br>
ideas future-ish isn't it? How bout all the extropians pitch in something<br>
like $20 and we'll see who cashes in in 2045? And all cryostabilized people<br>
will still need to pay up! Nobody said uploading would ever be easy.<br>

<i>&gt;It is far beyond even normal</i><br>

<i>&gt;immune-neutral, but also fast and reliable neural processing on a subcellular</i><br>

<i>&gt;a neuron, a way of replacing it while it is still working (neurons can extend</i><br>
<i>&gt;their axons for a long distance, up to a meter; growth this far takes a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;of time!) and finally being able to interface with the outside world in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;useful manner. </i><br>
<p>
Just implant a box in your head with a mini powerful PC inside with<br>
fiberoptics running to the uploading organism's biological i/o port so the<br>
latency won't be as long.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Using some kind of virus </i><br>

<p>
How could you upload by rebuilding neurons from the inside? Eat alot of<br>
lead and have highly complex virii or bacterium turn the stucture of your<br>
brain into circuit boards? hehe<br>
