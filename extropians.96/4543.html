<i>&gt; I'd hardly call that "totally free".</i><br>

<p>
For starters, observation is NOT repression. Reaction to action based on<br>
observation is repression. Ask any stripper if she feels repressed by<br>
the guys watching her (or him). How action of any kind is adjudicated is<br>
a completely different issue, and the real target of your political<br>
insecurity, not that it can be observed.<br>
<p>
THe need for privacy is psychologically a reaction to outside<br>
repression. A repression free society would feel no need for privacy.<br>
Not that nobody would have a need for privacy, but that the thought by<br>
individuals that they themselves would need privacy would not occur.<br>
because they have always been treated innocently, they would live in a<br>
natural state of innocence. it would truly be heaven on earth, as<br>
everyone would live angelically.<br>
<p>
of course such a state of cultural purity and innocence is in my view,<br>
well nigh impossible from the point at which we are now at unless:<br>
<p>
1) You start it on another planet with people prescreened and pretrained<br>
to live so.<br>
<p>
2) You could do it here, but you must form a one world government with<br>
total control in the hands of a group the existence of which is unknown<br>
to all others. I.e. you need perfect thought control. Such a regieme<br>
must be in control long enough for the ingrained insanity of our privacy<br>
crazed world to die out with the help of active negative feedback.<br>
<p>
While I see a thin possibility for the first, the second is in my mind<br>
impossible, and to attempt to do so thoroughly evil. You would wind up<br>
hurting more people than you help.<br>
