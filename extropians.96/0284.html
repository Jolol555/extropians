<p>
The big question is how to use maspar in an useful way. How do we run a <br>
word processor or matlab in a maspar network? <br>
<p>
This seems to be similar to the problems with process migration and <br>
distributed computing, although in this case one can (probably) assume <br>
identical processors at least. <br>
<p>
I think it is mainly a programming problem - we are not very good at <br>
creating parallel algorithms, and most obvious ways to do things for us <br>
are serial when they should be parallel. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; I think babies should be equipped with implants soon after birth. Only </i><br>

<p>
I think this would be ethical (if it could be done safely), since I <br>
approve of all changes that increase the freedom of acting of a being <br>
(after all, the child doesn't have to use it if it doesn't want it, and <br>
is given new abilities). But I guess others disagree. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; There are some speculation that the attractors replicate as a part of </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mental functioning. In this case adding more "cortex" would give us a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; larger mental space. Let's hope its true! :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but I wish this has happend at the genome level. (Toying with the </i><br>
<i>&gt; size of the cortex is easy: the genome is quite modular). On the other </i><br>
<i>&gt; hand, I remember reading that brain metabolism is even now a bottleneck </i><br>
<i>&gt; at some (early) developmental stage...</i><br>
<p>
Sounds quite possible, the brain gobbles up a surprisingly large fraction <br>
of our metabolism (was it 25%?). I think we would have to change the <br>
development of the brain so that it grows further after birth (another <br>
bottleneck [and a sick pun]). Perhaps development should be slowed <br>
somewhat so that the brain can grow further, but I doubt parents could <br>
stand a longer neonatal period! (Unless we engineer their hormones <br>
too! :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think most of the brain is rather static in circuitry, but its meaning </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can be very quickly redefined (remember the experiments with glasses </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; turning everything upside down - after a while vision worked as normal). </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; My guess is that parts of the cortex are undefined from the beginning, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and later used in various systems that emerge. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but even then their malleability is limited. Typically, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; topographically nearer the region, the more likely is it to take over the </i><br>
<i>&gt; function of the affected area.</i><br>
<p>
This is what happens when the brain is injured. But I think the ass. <br>
cortices contain a lot of independent connections that doesn't correspond <br>
to any clear-cut regions. <br>
