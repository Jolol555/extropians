You've just conceded my points, or I've never understood yours.  If a<br>
dog runs for a billion years it will not have achieved human level<br>
thought.  A dog is not on our level.  There are many possible Turing<br>
machines which could never emulate a UTM.  My perception of the strong<br>
Singularity has been that the Powers will work on a level we utterly<br>
cannot comprehend.  That we *can* simulate them at all is my contention.<br>
Turing-equivalence may be practically irrelevant between us and a 1000<br>
kilometer brain, but is not theoretically irrelevant.  We couldn't<br>
invent what they could, but we could understand it.  (And actually we<br>
could invent it, but it would take even longer.)<br>
