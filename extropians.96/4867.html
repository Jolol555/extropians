<p>
Eliezer, I suppose it is your special Algernonic abilities that<br>
lead you to arrogate to yourself the right to dictate, at gunpoint,<br>
which recreations and medications a human being self-administers.<br>
Suicide causes a lot of neurological damage, too: are you willing<br>
to deny yourself that right? (This is a trick question: think about<br>
cryonics.) Who owns whose life here?<br>
<p>
Perhaps if you would engage in a little more causal analysis (allow<br>
me to recommend economic analyses, among other things) you might<br>
see that most of the neurological damage you decry is *caused* by<br>
the very "War on (some) Drugs" that you praise. Certainly most of<br>
the neurological damage associated with drugs but caused by<br>
high-velocity lead pellets is.<br>
<p>
If crack cocaine is the incarnate evil that you suppose it is (and<br>
I concede the possibility), and since we already have the problem<br>
that it bypasses the normal mechanisms of human reward and motivation<br>
(as discussed in the Keith Henson essay I just posted), might it<br>
not be wise to do what we can to remove the *additional* incentive<br>
for its production and marketing provided by the very high level<br>
of black-market prices? And have you never suspected that, if crack<br>
is as horrible as you claim, it would be easier to educate people<br>
and provide medical and psychiatric assistance for those who need<br>
it if we could do away with the atmosphere of unreasoning fear and<br>
social taboo promoted by a "War on Drugs"? And have you never<br>
studied and thought seriously about the possible motivations of<br>
the people who have done the most to advance the "War on Drugs"?<br>
Who benefits?<br>
<p>
To simplify, we have two dangers here: cocaine and high-velocity<br>
lead pellets. You favor unleashing the latter to rein in the former.<br>
I consider the former to be less of a threat than the latter. I'm<br>
particularly appalled by your stance given that the history of the<br>
last twenty-five years shows that all attempts to use the latter<br>
to control the former merely make both scourges worse. The history<br>
of the prohibition of alcohol (another neurological scourge) earlier<br>
this century in the US tells a similar tale.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No.  There are no stupid masses.</i><br>
<p>
Then why is there need for the police to be running around shooting<br>
innocent people, breaking down perfectly good doors, and dragging<br>
people off to prison because of their preferences in neurochemical<br>
stimulation?<br>
<p>
If by "participation in the War on Drugs" you only meant the<br>
propaganda phase, that's okay with me... I tend to like wars of<br>
words. But as long as the War on Drugs *does* include a military<br>
component, as it does now, you might be wise to tone down your<br>
rhetoric. Otherwise you're likely to get yourself classed with the<br>
thugs and stormtroopers by the sort of people who *do* divide human<br>
beings into two types.<br>
<p>
(A personal note about my motivations in making this post: last<br>
year, a stranger held an automatic pistol to my head about a block<br>
from my house. I survived the experience but did not enjoy it. I<br>
don't approve of posts that contribute any detectable amount to<br>
the likelihood of my having to repeat that experience.)<br>
