How am I infected with the US vs them meme? when did I use entropic to<br>
designate disliked people? I sure hope you're not quoting my IRC chat<br>
because you don't have the time to think everything through in realtime<br>
communication as you do with a post.<br>

<p>
Ummm, nope. I'm only acting this way because I don't see anybody doing<br>
anything! Do something and I'll calm down.<br>

I'm not.<br>
