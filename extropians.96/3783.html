Well i can hardly believe my own eyes here. What is this talk? What<br>
happened to "self organisation in a chaotic systems?"<br>
<p>
We don't need a overall design for this thing. What we need is a Technical<br>
design guide for how to submit construcions, ideas, artwork etc. All we<br>
need is an URL and a ftp adress. Then everybody can do their own stuff. Let<br>
the good old competition decide who makes the best stuff. Lets have<br>
competition. (Well ok maybe we can't make competitions about what art is<br>
best. But in a subjective way we can. At least we can discuss it one the<br>
list. Somebody wants to do a 3D IRC chatchannel? Let'm roll their own.)<br>
Max More is completely right in saying that the biggest problem in a task<br>
like this is that we can get no pay, and that we work at different paces. I<br>
to have a LOT of experience in zero finance projects. The only way they can<br>
work is if there is some kind of personal gain. (Artistic or financial) If<br>
the financial gain is out of the loop, then it is almost impossible to get<br>
somebody to work for free on one's own pet project. We all wanna do our own<br>
thing.<br>
<p>
We need to build a completely open system that we all can modify at our own<br>
will. (well as much as possible.) The documentation should be there. Design<br>
guides, technical limitations etc. But no overall design. With sections and<br>
stuff. They will come automatically.<br>
<p>
Let the beyond live it's own life.<br>
<p>
I could do cool VRML stuff today, maybe i could later add music, sound<br>
effects and so on. (What about a 4Dimensional version of "LIFE" with a<br>
sound for when a cell dies and another when it is born. That could look<br>
cool and make interresting sounds. with 3D balls(or pyramids) shifting<br>
around in 3D space thru a 4th dimension. Whenever all the cells had died<br>
new ones could be generated randomly.) Well just an idea :-)<br>
<p>
What we are designing is a social system. Let's use as many "off the shelf"<br>
tools as possible. Moore's law tells us that they'll soon be wery<br>
powerfull.<br>
<p>
All we need to do is to establish an absolute minimum of rules that will<br>
allow os to do it. Then we can do it and make our own dreams come thru.<br>
They will probably match each other nicely.<br>
