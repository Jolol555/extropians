IAN: Govt regulations and taxes raise the price of consumer goods,<br>
while laissez-faire competition lowers it. Yet, while you support<br>
the former you condemn the latter for the effects of the former.<br>
Illogical.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?</i><br>
<i> &gt; They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it. </i><br>
<i> &gt; THe Ogoni in Nigeria. Yet, because they have our economic support, they </i><br>
<i> &gt; don't need anybody else's. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Africa has followed socialism far far more than laissez <br>
faire, yet you condemn laissez faire for the problems there.<br>
Illogical.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; IAN: Your saying that capitalism will lead to either [1] socialism</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; or [2] socialism so we would be better off with socialism.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; The fact is that both varieties of socialism you fear -- both </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; rule by a central cabal -- are achieved only by means antithetical </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; to capitalism, so there is a clear path: laissez faire.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;How will laissez faire prevent those things from happening? Either the </i><br>
<i> &gt;workers and the poor, of which there will be far more, will revolt as </i><br>
<i> &gt;Marx predicted. Or the powerful will have such control that the </i><br>
<i> &gt;peop[le won't be able to revolt. Laissez faire will not move wealth </i><br>
<i> &gt;around. It will centralize it into the hands of the most ruthless or capable.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Your claim that decentralization leads to centralization <br>
(therefore we need centralization to prevent decentralization)<br>
has no basis in fact. It is regulations and taxation that reduce<br>
the number of business, not the opposite. Learn about Hong Kong.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Socialism = universal social debt = totalitarianism.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Batista, Duvalier, Suharto, and Duarte all ran with capitalism, and yet </i><br>
<i> &gt; they were, (still are in the case of Suharto), completely totalitarian. </i><br>
<i> &gt; This is because the government was run for and by the private interests. </i><br>
<i> &gt; Which is what I think happens with laissez faire.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Laissez faire means "leave alone." <br>
A totalitarian govt is by definition not laissez faire.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I live in Canada, which is a fairly good  liberal socialism. I agree with </i><br>
<i> &gt; Banjo that capitalism needs a bit of government in order to keep it from </i><br>
<i> &gt; running amuck. ... i think we need to get a strong populist government.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Well at least you've dropped the anarchist pretense.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; But it doesn't. The freedom to do what you choose is still there, but of </i><br>
<i> &gt; course there are limits, because then you impinge on the freedom of </i><br>
<i> &gt; others. There is more freedom than capitalism because noone can tell you </i><br>
<i> &gt; what to do (with you having to take it, with no reasonable alternatives). </i><br>
<i> &gt; There is also mroe equality. Of course it's not a perfect system. But I'd </i><br>
<i> &gt; like a system that is flexible enough to meet the problems it runs into </i><br>
<i> &gt; without too much bureaucratic  procrastination. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Sorry but that's just pure pie-in-the-sky nonsense, which I'll <br>
counter with the same quantity of logic and fact you've supported it with.<br>
