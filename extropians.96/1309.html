Thank you Nadia. I intend the site to be a place where people can learn<br>
about Transhumanist Art, who some transhuman artists are, and a bit about<br>
our work.  I intend to show where different art genre's meet and where they<br>
separate so that people can get a quick guide to its art history. This way<br>
we won't lump all futuristic looking art as transhuman art when it is not<br>
based on the ideas and intentions of transhumans.  This is important because<br>
much contemporary art is deathist and angry, but utilizes interesting<br>
technology. And it is important for us to have a least some sense of<br>
sophistication about the genre we are participating in!  A transhuman making<br>
art that is not transhuman -:)<br>
<p>
I should let people know that it is under construction and that is why the<br>
links aren't happening.  I haven't written the pages. I will be able to work<br>
on it in two weeks.<br>

I think this might be just the view of a few.  Certainly, by having a<br>
Transhumanist Art list, anyone who does not have a strong background in art,<br>
or art hisory and art theory can join in and learn.  This would be really<br>
great and much needed.  Certainly, art has value and meaning.  How many<br>
would join?  Well, perhaps a lot of artists!  Let anyone who isn't an artist<br>
read the list guidelines and FAQ list to learn terms first to learn a few<br>
references.  I find that some of previous confusion was because words are<br>
used differently in different professions/disciplines and _also_ that, in<br>
general, people have different reference points from which to draw ideas and<br>
criticism.  If someone has never seen or read about a specific style of art,<br>
how on earth can he or she discuss it intelligently?  <br>
