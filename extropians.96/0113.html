<p>
IAN: I can speak for myself, not for others. Others have different <br>
goals. If I want to make my goals the goal of "the whole human race," <br>
then I will have to resort to skillful persuasion or coercion. <br>
Libertarianism simply stipulates that the only ethical course <br>
of action is persuasion. In fact, nonaggression is also the <br>
course that leads to maximal social benefit. <br>
<p>
Focus on the individual does not contradict a focus on the whole,<br>
for, as you keenly observe:<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; As I see it, none of us truly has an individual "self" -- </i><br>
<i>  &gt; the self is a social/cultural construct.  We are all, in </i><br>
<i>  &gt; the end, made up of EACH OTHER. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: As there is no "individual" -- that is, no unit that is what it <br>
is free from external relations -- there is only a unified holistic <br>
identity composed of many faces, each creating the other, thus it <br>
follows that: <br>
<p>
1) Focus on the whole is focus on the individual: when I say <br>
X is good for everybody, so DO IT ! ( ;^) ) I focus on my <br>
individual valuation/measurements over that of all others.<br>
(Notice that most megalomaniacs -- hyper egoists aggressors -- <br>
speak in terms of 'the whole human race,' and its conquest.)<br>
<p>
2) Focus on the individual is focus on the whole: The whole<br>
is composed of the individual many times over. You can <br>
only "reach" the whole if you can reach each individual.<br>
<p>
So the "focus on the individual" is not a contradiction of the <br>
unified relational identity that contains each individual.<br>
In fact, advocating decentralized economic planning is<br>
advocating the liberation of the collective identity<br>
expressed as "the invisible hand." Central economic<br>
planning is the advocation of control of the whole<br>
human race by a few individual planners.<br>
<p>
<p>
But I agree that addressing the collective identity that each <br>
person is, is a necessary feature of any winning meme. In fact, <br>
those memes that speak to the collective identity have proven <br>
to be most successful in their spread.<br>
<p>
The majority of people who know of libertarianism but reject<br>
it, do so, in my experiential observation, because they feel<br>
that it does not speak to the collective identity and offer <br>
it, of which I am a part, economic guarantees. The point is<br>
that central planning does offer the guarantee of bankruptcy,<br>
while free markets guarantee improving standards of living,<br>
innovation and consistently lower prices on average.<br>
<p>
<p>
Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)<br>
<p>
Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A<br>
