From: Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; When a protein embedded in a membrane encounters a certain </i><br>
<i>&gt; molecule, it reacts -- it suddenly changes its mode of vibration, and   </i><br>
<i>&gt; this change reverberates all over the membrane, causing further changes </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the vibrations of all other proteins embedded in the membrane.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a result of one molecule encountering one protein, pores may </i><br>
<i>&gt; open or close all over the membrane, as other proteins react to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; change in vibration of the sensor protein.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's how membranes work.  At a very low temperature, such </i><br>
<i>&gt; pulsations would not exist.  The atoms would be nearly motionless.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Therefore biological membranes require temperatures in a certain range.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Below that range, one would have to use other mechanisms to replace </i><br>
<i>&gt; membranes. </i><br>
<p>
I have never heard of this phenomenon.  It would be interesting and<br>
surprising if this is really how information is transported to the<br>
various proteins within membranes.  I would think the (thermal?) vibrations<br>
of the proteins would be swamped with other thermal noise within the<br>
membrane environment and be unable to propagate for any distance.<br>
<p>
Is this a real effect, or is this just one of Lyle's games?<br>
<p>
