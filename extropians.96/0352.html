Yes! It works! I'm also highly skeptical about these things, and have never<br>
seen results from other substances, such as chromium picolinate. However, I<br>
decided to try creatine after Dr. Ray Sahelian, who is coming out with a<br>
short book on the stuff (see the forthcoming Extropy for a review), did some<br>
research and said it looked promising.<br>
<p>
After two months using it, I gained about 10 lbs. Usually I gain much more<br>
slowly, having been stable at around 183 lbs for months. I'm now 193 lbs. I<br>
don't think much, if any of it is fat. Possibly some may be extra fluid<br>
retention, though I have no particular reason to think so. Certainly my<br>
strength has increased considerably. E.g., I've gone from 580 lbs to 650 lbs<br>
on the leg press, and from 80 lbs to 110 lbs (for 15 reps) on the barbell curl.<br>
<p>
I'm happy with the results!<br>

<p>
You can get a kilo for $80, or 450 g for about $45. Ray's book gives<br>
guidelines for dosing. I got my from Lindberg/Nutrition Express: 1-800-338-7979<br>
<p>
Get a bigger body to go along with that bigger brain!<br>
