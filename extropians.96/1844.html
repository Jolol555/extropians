In light of David's intentful prose, here is a segment from _The<br>
Automorpher_ which is in step with this type of artful thinking:<br>
<p>
(Scene IV)<br>
<p>
Smooth sensual silicon<br>
Silver like structures<br>
running pulses of data. =20<br>
Glistening chips, nanochips, small smaller smallest. =20<br>
Animated realities, virtual realities, multiple selves. =20<br>
<p>
A door opened quietly<br>
And she walked into the room<br>
her body smooth, supple<br>
<p>
Her shoulders held back proud<br>
a glimmer in her eye<br>
and without notice<br>
she brushes her hair away<br>
<p>
How old are you? they asked.<br>
How old are you?<br>
<p>
A hesitation filled her=20<br>
as she quickly assessed<br>
<p>
My augmentation is three years now<br>
my right hip five<br>
ocular implants just two weeks<br>
age reversal nearly nine<br>
<p>
She took a sip of water<br>
licking the droplets off her lips<br>
her eyes glimmering hair a shimmering sterling,=20<br>
her outer sheath like mulatto warm bronze<br>
<p>
How old are you? they asked<br>
How old are you?<br>
<p>
And when she turned to leave the room<br>
all eyes followed her form=20<br>
just to realize before she left<br>
She was not yet born<br>
<p>
<p>
(Scene V - a declaration)<br>
<p>
Do you know your mythic presence?=20<br>
You must know your mythic present.<br>
 =20<br>
Out of the stockade of stereotypical thinking,<br>
idle beliefs, negative-newsmaking,=20<br>
stagnant relationships or<br>
the voice of mythic collective identity.<br>
Turn-off the haze, tune-up the mind.<br>
<p>
Create new myths.<br>
Your mythic heroes become a composit of many.<br>
Prometheus, Nietzsche,=20<br>
Camille Paglia or Da Vinci=20<br>
Who do you admire? =20<br>
Design a concept =97 design a Hero.<br>
<p>
Learn about your genes and the evolution of memes.<br>
Recognize that what you pay attention to will be<br>
incorporated in your thinking. =20<br>
What you think is what you are.<br>
Think artfully.<br>
<p>
Sculpt your being as you would a great masterpiece.<br>
Master intelligent thinking.=20<br>
Render flexibility, optimism, inventiveness.<br>
The concept of art is not standing still<br>
