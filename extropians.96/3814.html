<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;Now Brin himself has come out seriously proposing that privacy is evil,</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is, of course, a profoundly and willfully tendentious statement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; diametrically opposed to what I really believe, and to what I said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One critical trait shown by mature disputants is a sincere effort to</i><br>

My statement of David Brin's views was based on my sincere attempt to<br>
understand them in our correspondence a couple of years ago.  I am very<br>
surprised to hear that my statements are diametrically opposed to what he<br>
really believes.  It is possible that he has changed his views since our<br>
earlier discussion, or perhaps I misunderstood what he was saying before.<br>
<p>
I do not have his permission to quote from the draft which David Brin<br>
shared with me a few years ago, but here are a couple of paraphrases:<br>
<p>
In discussing the pros and cons of privacy, Brin argues that there is<br>
a dichotomy between privacy and freedom, that if we have the one, we cannot<br>
have the other.  He says that someday we may look back and realize that<br>
this was the real choice facing us today, and that our efforts to preserve<br>
privacy will actually cost us our freedom.<br>
<p>
In discussing the Clipper chip debate, a still-active policy dispute over<br>
the government's efforts to ensure that it can get access to the plaintext<br>
of encrypted communications, Brin offers a "Third Option": neither allow<br>
the government a monopoly on eavesdropping, nor let individuals and<br>
corporations have the ability to send meaningless scrambled messages and<br>
static.  If the average person can't read the message, it should be<br>
forbidden.  Encryption must be banned!<br>
<p>
Now he then follows this with some caveats related to the _practicality_<br>
of the proposal, but not to the moral justification.<br>
<p>
Brin concludes the draft of his book by clarifying that he personally<br>
has a vested interest in what he is advocating.  The widespread use<br>
of crypto raises many difficult issues with respect to "intellectual<br>
property": books, music, software, video, etc.  With the ease of copying<br>
and reproduction which computers provide, and the cloak of secrecy which<br>
is enabled by privacy protecting technologies like cryptography, it<br>
could become very difficult to prevent widespread piracy and unauthorized<br>
reproduction.  Someone who makes his living by writing, as Brin does (and<br>
as I do myself, for that matter, being a programmer by profession), could<br>
find it difficult to thrive in a world which had privacy protections.<br>
<p>
While I find it admirable that Brin is willing to make this forthright<br>
admission, it still makes me question his arguments.  And now when he<br>
says that his position is "diametrically opposed" to my characterization,<br>
I can only wonder at why he would have found it necessary to make this<br>
admission if I was so wrong in my reading of his views.<br>
<p>
My real problem with David Brin's argument is not so much with the question<br>
of whether privacy will be possible.  I am content to wait and see how<br>
the technologies work out.  My views are different from his, but it doesn't<br>
really matter because time will eventually settle the issue regardless<br>
of what we believe.<br>
<p>
What bothers me is when he departs from prediction and gets into advocacy,<br>
as in the examples above.  If he wants to prevent me from using encryption<br>
on the net, or he tries to convince people that they face a choice between<br>
privacy and freedom (with the implication that they must forbid privacy<br>
in order to retain freedom), I see threats to my own freedom of choice<br>
and action.  I am not trying to demonize Brin or exaggerate his views.<br>
I do, however, view his ideas as dangerous in their implications.<br>
