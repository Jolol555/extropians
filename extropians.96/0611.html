<i>&gt; Mammal brains have been growing somewhat steadily since all the dinos</i><br>
<i>&gt; were killed off 65 mya [...]</i><br>
<p>
  ... and even before then, I believe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... birds also have brains as big as mammals ...</i><br>
<p>
  I recall from somewhere the suggestion that maybe large brains are a<br>
consequence of the thermodynamics of small endotherms.  A small<br>
creature that keeps itself warmer than its surroundings by metabolism<br>
has to burn a lot of calories to do so.  It can't save fuel by holding<br>
still -- the resting metabolic rates of chipmunk-size mammals are ten<br>
times those of comparably sized reptiles, thus the food requirements<br>
are also ten times as great.  One may as well move around as shiver;<br>
thus there is no real energy cost to engaging in such energy-consuming<br>
behaviors as investigating and manipulating the environment, play,<br>
randomly doing this and that, and so on.  If there is any benefit to<br>
these behaviors, evolution may more easily select for them.<br>
  Note furthermore that the brain is a great consumer of calories.  If<br>
you've got to burn them anyway, just to keep warm, there relatively<br>
little extra cost to using them to support a larger and more capable<br>
brain.<br>
