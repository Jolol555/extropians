<i>&gt; Why do libertarians generally feel the need to dress up empathy as</i><br>
<i>&gt; somehow selfish?  Surely it is just what it seems: concern for others,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pure and simple.  This is the more baneful side of Rand's influence</i><br>
<i>&gt; at work again.  Ach, so much good she did, yet how much confusion has</i><br>
<i>&gt; flowed from her work also!</i><br>
<p>
Sometimes one must fight evil ideas by being deliberately provocative<br>
and extreme in the other direction.  The unspeakable evil of the cult<br>
of self-sacrifice demands such a fight.  How can one possibly love<br>
life without loving one's own most?  And if you do, how can that be<br>
for rational reasons if it is unconnected with personal experience?<br>
<p>
The word "selfish" has a lot of emotional baggage attached to it--<br>
prejudices that were instilled in us all our lives, but it is so often<br>
used to describe things that are ethical life-loving choices, that<br>
embracing it as a positive has an enlightening effect that wouldn't<br>
occur with less loaded words like "life-affirming" or "empowering".<br>
<p>
If I didn't value my own life above all things, why would I suppose<br>
others have such value for their lives?  I respect their lives and<br>
their values not /instead/ of my own, or even /as well as/ my own,<br>
but /because/ I value my own, and I recognize that they are the same.<br>
Rand may have been wordy, and sometimes obtuse, and often provocative,<br>
but she also gave us some of the most beautiful words and ideas that<br>
anyone has ever expressed:<br>
<p>
  "I swear by life and my love for it, that I will never live for<br>
  the sake of another man, or ask another man to live for mine."<br>
<p>
How could that be put any better?<br>
