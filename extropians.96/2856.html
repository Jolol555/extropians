There are many possibilities here.  First, we don't even know that Salinger<br>
was telling the truth when he attributed the document to a "secret service<br>
agent."  If we are going to question almost the entire U.S. government<br>
(which is OK), we should also be able to question Pierre Salinger (even<br>
more OK).<br>
<p>
Does anyone besides me see a possible motivation for Pierre Salinger?<br>
There he is living in left-wing France -- an enlightened country just<br>
trying to keep foreign words from polluting their language.  A number of<br>
French citizens were killed in the crash.  But so far, there is no<br>
satisfactory explanation of what caused the crash.  People don't like<br>
living with such uncertainty.  Pierre Salinger comes along and blames it on<br>
those nasty, foreign imperialists.  Pierre Salinger becomes a national hero<br>
in France.  Many paid speaking engagements result.<br>
<p>
I wish I could prove it, but alas, I cannot. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you recall, this is the same thing the FBI said about the "shoot to</i><br>

<p>
Two things.  First, the truth did come out.  (Or did it? &lt;g&gt;)  Second, it's<br>
easier to mislead people about a relatively isolated action by a single<br>
government agency.  Can anyone convince 300 members of a Navy destroyer<br>
crew to keep quiet just because to do otherwise would embarass the Navy?<br>
Heck, I bet half the people in the Navy are there mainly to get a cheap<br>
education, and are basically honest.  But even if only 10% are basically<br>
honest, does anyone think that 10% would watch a passenger plane get shot<br>
down by accident (I presume) and then agree to silence?  Would none of them<br>
want to know someone had the courage to reveal the truth -- especially when<br>
it could be their families or friends on board the plane next time?<br>
<p>
Is cynicism extropic or entropic?<br>
