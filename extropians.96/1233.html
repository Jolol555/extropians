IAN: I can't cite documentation, but a pilot of another plane<br>
said that he was flying at 10,000 feet and looked down to see <br>
the TWA plane explode. While from that we should assume that <br>
TWA flight 800 was under 10,000 ft, I am not sure how the<br>
specific 7,600 ft was concluded by the author above.<br>
<p>
Also, if the FBI falsified the altitude to be higher than it <br>
was, that tends to rule out a terrorist hit and puts the plane<br>
in the "maybe the Navy hit it" altitude. Thus, such a falsification<br>
seems to back-fire for the govt in this respect. ??  Of course, if <br>
they can just say, "It's crazy to say the Navy hit it," and the <br>
case is closed with everyone believing it, then it's a good <br>
move as it rules out any missile hit by fabrication &amp; bluff.<br>
