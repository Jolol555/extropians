Sorry, but none of this is likely to apply.  The bottom-level processes<br>
of MNT may well emerge from the capitalist economy because of the great<br>
capital investment required, but turning that capability into a usable<br>
manufacturing system may well emerge from other places, like the ever-<br>
growing non-commercial sector.  We may not have an FNF yet, but we will,<br>
as the seeds are already in place.<br>
<p>
Secondly, regardless of from where usable MNT systems will emerge, at<br>
some point in time they *will* become public domain, and at that point<br>
all bets are off.  Your paragraph shows quite well how today's economy<br>
and industry in general is wholly dependent on manufacturing capability<br>
not being freely available.  Well, that's the whole point about nanotech,<br>
that it not only brings the cost of manufacturing down to the near-zero<br>
limit, but much, much more importantly, it brings the cost of means of<br>
production down to that same limit.<br>
<p>
When that happens, all those factories which you find so essential to<br>
mankind will lose the key reason for their existence, namely that today<br>
people cannot avoid using them because manufacturing modern material<br>
things requires immense resources, even if the cost of the raw materials<br>
is peanuts.  With that basic equation being about to change, I do not<br>
see how one can support the idea that the intertwined economic/market/<br>
manufacturing institutions of today will remain essentially the same.<br>
