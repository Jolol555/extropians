<i>&gt;  "Sufficiently advanced communication is indistinguishable from noise."</i><br>
<p>
I really like this quote.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again I apologize as I explain the joke fully because it's the basis of</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I want to say: 1) Arthur C. Clarke's Law is that "Any sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt;advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 2) Cryptograpy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;steganography (hiding data within other data) and data compression produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;signals that look as much as possible like random numbers.  Cryptography and</i><br>
<i>&gt;steganography because they are trying to reveal as little as possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt;data compression because any non-noiselike character of a signal represents</i><br>
<i>&gt;redundancy, a waste of bandwidth.  The joke for crypto and compression</i><br>
<i>&gt;people is that here is a basic truism in both fields that happens to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a natural phrasing just like Clarke's law.  The joke for extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that Clarke is wrong (or was, if he's since wised up): information is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ultimate technology, and ultimate information looks like...nothing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not flashy magic, just nothing.  It works hard to look like nothing.</i><br>
<p>
The better the compression, the more information looks like noise so this<br>
means that possibly we will never see civilizations more advanced than we<br>
and the only civilizations we will ever see will be less evolved because<br>
equal or higher means we're less likely to recognize them. Damn. Although<br>
this does give justification to requote entire posts so to make more<br>
redundant data for the alien civilizations to recognize. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Which is what we see when we look at the skies.  Or at the dirt at our feet,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or at the Sun, or each other, for that matter.  Nothing...unnatural.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nothing...unexpected.  Nothing...out of the ordinary.</i><br>
<p>
Shit, you're right. If you wished to get really bizarre, you could say that<br>
the dirt under your house is actually an uploaded civilization in statis<br>
with their molecular patterns stored in an organization of dirt molecules<br>
