          I recommend every transhumanist to read Robin Hansons short <br>
          document at <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html</a>. <br>
          It gives a clear presentation of an argument that should be <br>
          taken very seriously.<br>
          <br>
          (First a minor comment:<br>
<i>          &gt;But if single-cell life started in some distant molecular</i><br>
<i>          &gt;cloud and spread here via a wider panspermia, then that </i><br>
<i>          &gt;does help, in proportion to the</i><br>
<i>          &gt;volume of space between here and there. The chance of life </i><br>
<i>          &gt;starting in any one small volume</i><br>
<i>          &gt;can be pretty low and still be consistent with that data.</i><br>
          <br>
          But on the other hand, if the distance were very great, then <br>
          it would be unlikely that the "molecular cloud" would not <br>
          have infected many other planets in its surroundings, some <br>
          of which would have evolved life that expanded into the <br>
          universe and which we should have discovered. Wouldn't it be <br>
          more reassuring if Earth and Mars had been infected by a <br>
          _local_ panspermia (from another planet in our solar system, <br>
          or from a nearby solar system)?)<br>
          <br>
          If life developed independently on Earth and on Mars, what <br>
          could block the conclusion that our far future is probably <br>
          doomed? I can see only three potential answers:<br>
          <br>
          1. As you suggest, there could be a great filter at some <br>
          later stage in the evolution of high intelligence.<br>
          2. Higher life forms continue to prosper but do not cause an <br>
          "explosion" into cosmos. (I think that Michael Wiik favoured <br>
          this alternative.)<br>
          3. Higher life forms do explode into cosmos, but in ways <br>
          that are invisible to us. This would presumably mean that <br>
          they do not engage in galactic scale constructions, and that <br>
          they are not interested in contacting human level life.<br>
          <br>
          As for (1), it is dubious that such a filter would be <br>
          sufficiently effective to bring down the probability from <br>
          the value we would give it knowing that life evolved <br>
          independently on two planets in our solar system (say p=2/9) <br>
          down to the value that is equal the inverse of the number of <br>
          planets less than a few million light years away from us. <br>
          However, our present biological knowledge is not sufficient <br>
          to settle this issue, so it leaves some room for hope.<br>
          <br>
          Alternative (2) might be more likely. Why should any <br>
          intelligent being explore the details of cold and monotonous <br>
          space if they can live in a much richer VR? And why should <br>
          they care about reality at all, whether real reality or <br>
          virtual reality, if they can achieve satisfaction from drugs <br>
          and electrical stimulation? If this is the case, they might <br>
          deem that no or only relatively minor space missions are <br>
          sufficient. I don't know of any conclusive psychological, <br>
          cybernetic or political arguments that this will that it <br>
          won't happen. Also there is the possibility that the <br>
          relevant technologies for extensive space colonisation <br>
          simply aren't feasible.<br>
          <br>
          Alternative (3) does not seem extremely improbable either. <br>
          Humanoid civilisations might not be at all interesting to <br>
          posthumans. And it is hard to tell what sort of <br>
          manipulations of the universe a posthuman culture would find <br>
          suitable. Also, there could perhaps be ethical/strategic <br>
          reasons for not interfering to much with the natural order <br>
          in cosmos.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that only alternative (1) is compatible <br>
          with typical transhumanist accounts of the far future of <br>
          mankind.<br>
          <br>
          Then, of course, there is the other possibility: that <br>
          intelligent life almost always put an end to its own <br>
          existence once it has reached a certain level of <br>
          sophistication. It would be interesting to list the ways in <br>
          which this could happen.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          I don't know whether it would be significant, but mankind <br>
          has been sending out signals into space for some time now. <br>
          Even if humanoid life tended to annihilate itself 50 or 100 <br>
          years after it began to search for extraterrestrial life, <br>
          there would still be a chance that the civilisations on two <br>
          planets could overlap so that one would find out about the <br>
          other. If we have been signalling into space for some time <br>
          t, and the average time a species is actively searching for <br>
          life in the universe is T, then the probability that we <br>
          should have had an overlap with a given hi-tech life on a <br>
          planet would be P(overlap)=(t+T)/5*10^9, where we have <br>
          estimated the period in which such life is likely to occur <br>
          to 5*10^9. If we multiply this with the number of planets n <br>
          such that we would have discovered a signal from them had it <br>
          been sent, and with r, the average number of times hi-tech <br>
          life occurs on a planet given that it occurs there at all, <br>
          and with the likelihood P(hi-tech evolves) that high-tech <br>
          life evolves on a given planet, we get an estimate of the a <br>
          priori probability that we should have discovered <br>
          extraterrestrial life<br>
          <br>
          P(high-tech found)=P(hi-tech evolves)*n*r*(t+T)/5*10^9<br>
          <br>
          r is presumably a small number (say 1.8), but if n were very <br>
          great, then, since we have reason to believe that P(high <br>
          tech found) is not much bigger that 0.5, we would have to <br>
          conclude that P(hi-tech evolves) is small. If this were the <br>
          case, then that would be reassuring, for it would indicate <br>
          that hi-tech life is rare, so that the fact that we have not <br>
          seen traces of any life explosion need not mean that there <br>
          has to be a great filter. However, I doubt that n is great <br>
          enough today. Does anybody know the relevant facts about the <br>
          search for extraterrestrial life to make a reasonable <br>
          estimate of n?<br>
