The Low Willow writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; in my case being childhood playground prey trained me to track</i><br>

<p>
This is odd.  In my school, nobody was prey.  There was no such <br>
concept.  Did you grow up in Africa?  <br>
<p>
If you were the prey, who were the predators?  <br>
<p>
I don't think they should have preyer in schools.  (Sorry, I just couldn't <br>
resist.)  <br>
