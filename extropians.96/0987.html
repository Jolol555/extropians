 Commercial companies are very good at providing motivation<br>
for development, finding resources and rewarding contributions<br>
of ideas and effort - this seems to be a winning combination<br>
when an idea is relatively simple and can be developed into<br>
a product by a relatively small group of people in a reasonable<br>
time frame.  When one wants to design a global system that would<br>
benefit many diverse groups of people in the long run, then open<br>
social discussion would appear essential.<br>
  Now, what if one tries to develop a business providing services<br>
with a wide range of implications?  Like a new system of knowledge<br>
distribution on the Net?  Is it possible to find an approach that<br>
would promote business interests (profit, market share, security, PR,<br>
not scaring away investors and not giving advantage to competition,<br>
etc.)  of the company, and at the same time involve people in<br>
academia and general public in discussing optimal structure of the<br>
venture and its product line, writing additional software, choice of<br>
which parts of the sytem should remain proprietary and which should<br>
be made open?<br>
<p>
  I think this is a generally interesting issue - and it seems to be<br>
growing in importance as more and more businesses and products become<br>
parts of the global system. Now I also find myself quite practically<br>
interested in it, as I am working on development of Automated<br>
Collaborative Filtering (ACF) systems for Internet.<br>
<p>
 I would appreciate any general or practical ideas you may have on<br>
the subject, or references to any relevant sources.<br>
