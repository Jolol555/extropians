I think that you have missed the whole point of TANSTAAFL. Its purpose (an<br>
excellent one to my mind) is to remind us all that, one way or another, we DO<br>
always earn and pay for everything we get. In the above example you have<br>
prepaid (or earned) your "free" lunches and dinners by educating and refining<br>
the quality and appeal of the person you are. In addition, there is involved<br>
here different kinds of value, some monetary and some non-monetary<br>
(spiritual?). So there is really no question of needing to abandon the ideas of<br>
trade to mutual advantage even in this context. A wider question which I would<br>
like to see discussed in a thread (maybe is has been before, I am new to the<br>
list) would be whether all of a person's values are even commensurable (and<br>
therefore can be evaluated in terms of money).<br>
<p>
I agree that<br>
<i>&gt;3. Life is full of thess little catch phases-homilies, old </i><br>
<i>&gt;wives tales, fables.... a meme, a myth...</i><br>
<i>&gt;the benefit would be, parents and elders can tell us our</i><br>
<i>&gt;limits, try to warn us, I guess...</i><br>
<p>
But I don't agree that they should *all* be written off and ignored. Certainly,<br>
most are either useless, misleading, or even grossly harmful. However, some of<br>
them (and TANSTAAFL) is one such, play a very useful role as a concise summing<br>
up of some very fundamental logical or reality ideas. Two that come immediately<br>
to mind which I particularly like and value are "It's a chicken and egg<br>
problem" and "You can't see the forrest for the trees"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But I avoid them all, and even try to avoid repetitious, obviously pat, </i><br>
<i>&gt;thoughts of my *own*. If I have decided "it is so", and invented a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;mental script, I am probably atrophy prone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are to many NEW patterns to explore to get stuck on old ones.</i><br>
<p>
Again, I don't agree. Yes, one should not get "stuck on" old patterns. But<br>
neither should one abandon "truths", just because they are old.<br>
