And then the old hype is mainly forgotten. The few really useful things <br>
from it are in common use, and the rest is ignored. Since it is unlikely <br>
we will see major breakthroughs during the short span of time the public <br>
is interested due to the hype, many will simply dismiss extropianism as <br>
pie-in-the-sky. <br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Interesting thought: there will be a lot of millennarian groups predicting</i><br>

<i>&gt; making people flock to us rather than them.</i><br>
<p>
Want to bet that there will be religions all the way up to the <br>
singularity? I think you severly underestimate the mutation rate of <br>
religion, and the general human need for it. Religions often deal with <br>
unsettling advances in scitech by becoming *more* irrational, and it <br>
doesn't reduce the number of believers by much. Lets just say that the <br>
Hare Krishnas swear that the Bahadvagita is the literal truth, and it <br>
clearly proclaims that the earth is flat. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When that happens look for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians being labeled with AntiChrist and satanic memes. Max More the</i><br>
<i>&gt; AntiChrist! Which will cause even more people to flock to us because we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been labeled "Taboo".</i><br>
<p>
(Small contradiction here in your argument, since you assume above that <br>
religion will loose its power; that implies that being the antichrist <br>
isn't taboo any longer). <br>
<p>
We will see these reactions *much* sooner. Try explaining transhumanism <br>
to most people. <br>
