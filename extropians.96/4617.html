In a message dated 96-12-22 16:45:03 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Yeah but if you don't augment yourself fast enough you'll be left behind<br>
 and archaic and eventually become incompatable with the operating system<br>
 and die. Also uploaded beings with more power and processing speed will be<br>
 able to augment faster than you and be many times more creative and<br>
 intelligent than you and thus discover anything new in any material you<br>
 could possibly have access to before you get there and thus never be able<br>
 to climb the tree.&gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
At that point you would be confined to engaging in activities the poor of<br>
today cannot.  I'm talking about the wonderful virtual realities envisioned<br>
for uploads.  The capital required to maintain such worlds for slow AIs would<br>
be a fraction of the GNP of the upload community.  You could think of it as a<br>
brighter version of today's welfare money (insignificant really) being spent<br>
on drugs (what those who have nothing meaningful to offer do).<br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;&gt;My personal view is that individual identity will cease to have meaning in<br>
a<br>
<i> &gt;world of uploads.  Communication between individuals could be so complete</i><br>
<i> &gt;that one could not tell where one ends and the other begins.</i><br>
 <br>
 Ughh! I don't want to become a borganism. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The trend was started when organisms began communicating.  It has become more<br>
pronounced with the development of cellular technology.  Many religions dream<br>
about it (become one with God/Heaven/Universe sort of thing).  This rapid<br>
communication is why I support the view that Tipler's Omega Point will be one<br>
entity.<br>
