<i>&gt;If it were inevitable that we could not watch them, but open to choice</i><br>

<i>&gt;-- let them not watch us.</i><br>

David Brin responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Yes, that is a basic assumption of my argument.  I believe it is supported</i><br>
<i>&gt;by history.</i><br>
<i>&gt;No mass government in all of history has known as much about its people as</i><br>
<i>&gt;ours does.  And no mass citizenry has ever been as free.  The obvious fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that there is zero correlation between limiting the governments access</i><br>
<i>&gt;to information and our freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is an almost direct correlation, on the other hand, between freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt;and our ability to deny government officials secrecy.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I asked you to defend your assumptions about what our real choices are<br>
regarding who can watch who, and you responded with claimed<br>
correlation info on govt "access to info" vs. "freedom", and on<br>
"freedom" vs. govt "officials secrecy".  <br>
<p>
I am having trouble mapping between these two sets of concepts.  I<br>
presume govt access to info means govt can watch us, and govt<br>
officials secrecy means we can't watch govts.  But what does "freedom"<br>
mean about who can watch who?  And what would these correlations imply<br>
about our choice set? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact, Robin, in your second scenario... if it is inevitable that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot watch them... it will not matter an iota whether we are all armed</i><br>
<i>&gt;with PGP.  Aristos and bureaucrats will conspire together with impunity,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and eventually crush us.  PGP is defeated pretty easily by a battering ram</i><br>
<i>&gt;and armed storm troopers.  </i><br>
<p>
Not an iota?  This is a pretty strong claim.  It would seem that<br>
authoritarian regimes have varied greatly in how badly they treat<br>
their citizens, large scale conspiracies may be detected even if the<br>
principals use crypto, and the expense of crushing each person should<br>
effect how often folks are crushed.  Perhaps you exaggerate?<br>
