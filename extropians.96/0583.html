I agree that it would be beneficial to have brain power aligned with <br>
activity (it tends to naturally do so).  I`ve always admired the <br>
social structure of ants and termites: no real central authority, and <br>
each member of the work force physically/mentally tailored to it`s <br>
function.  There is no reason why drones won`t be happy doing doing <br>
there work.  I`m quite happy studying computer science, and don`t <br>
feel bad or any less happy that I`m not studying quantum physics.<br>
<p>
Slavery - Forcing someone to do work that`s below their potential.<br>
