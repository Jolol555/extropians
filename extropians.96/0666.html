As you say, there is no way of answering this question.  A pratical <br>
solution is to ask: "What will be the effect on my life if I believe <br>
that I`m living in a virtual world?" If you like the results, go for <br>
it.  I prefer to think that we are living in a virtual world, and I`m <br>
discovering the keys to manipulating it from the _outside_.  <br>
Again this has no relevance to objective reality (whatever than <br>
means),  it only makes life a little more interesting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, I can see a lot of people on this list recoiling from the idea </i><br>
that we <br>
<i>&gt; are already living in a virtual world because this would open up the </i><br>
<i>&gt; possiblilty that a lot of the Mystical, New-Age, Religious "bullshit" is </i><br>
<i>&gt; correct.  If we are living in a virtual world, then "miracles" would be very </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible, like special effects in a movie.  It would also open up the </i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility that we DO have some kind of "spirit" or "soul", in relation to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the lifetime we are experiencing (that is, that we have the major part of </i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves living somewhere else besides this lifetime).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I don't think that it is valid to reject the idea that we are already </i><br>
<i>&gt; living in a virtual world, simply because it opens up the possibilities that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the "irrationalists" are right about certain aspects of reality.</i><br>
<p>
I am always right about my reality, I`ve defined it that way.  I can <br>
only comment on _my_ reality (I know of no other)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is some truth to what they are saying.  But, then again, maybe not, but I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt; not finding it easy to dismiss the idea that I *MAY* already be living in a </i><br>
