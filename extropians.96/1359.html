<i>&gt;Kathryn, unless I (and others) have misunderstood what you've been saying,</i><br>
<i>&gt;for quite some time now now you've been arguing in favour of using in</i><br>
<i>&gt;social studies, methods less formal than science advocates, while STILL</i><br>
<i>&gt;wishing to call the studies sciences --- in other words, you've been trying</i><br>
<i>&gt;to soften the strict foundations of science, or at least to muddy the</i><br>
<i>&gt;waters in such a way that a non-science can appear as a science.  </i><br>
<p>
I apologize to this list for this discussion involving me getting so <br>
far.  My original intention was to listen, then I responded to <br>
something Eugene wrote without realizing that I was replying to this <br>
list.  And now, I can only interpret this post by Rich as a continuing <br>
attack on the social sciences that began on the transhumanist list <br>
and has migrated to this list.<br>
<p>
My use of Bart Kosko's quote was to supplement my own spontaneous <br>
poetics on the nature of knowledge, which I now realize was a mistake <br>
to have posted to this list.<br>
<p>
I don't make any apologies for being a student of the social <br>
sciences, and I fail to understand how my own estimation of the <br>
methodologies of the social sciences undermines the methodologies of <br>
the "hard" sciences.   My own contention has always been that <br>
different types of knowledge require different tools of measurement <br>
and analysis.<br>
<p>
Having said that, I now exit this discussion.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
<p>
