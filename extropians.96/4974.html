Eliezer Yudkowsky srites, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think that asking whether there were really gas chambers in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Holocaust is a question which:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  1)  Is of no conceivable positive value;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  2)  Is of very great negative value.  </i><br>
<p>
No doubt.  I'm not surprised that you feel that way.  A lot of people do.  <br>
As someone pointed out earlier today, in some countries it is *illegal* <br>
to question the gas chambers.  In America the sanctions are informal, <br>
but still severe enough that many people (including someone on this list <br>
who ought to have more courage) are afraid to discuss it.  <br>
<p>
I think getting the truth out has intrinsic value.  I am going to continue <br>
exposing the Holocaust meme for what it is.  Before I'm finished, a <br>
million students will have read Michael Shermer's article as carefully <br>
as I read it.  <br>
<p>
Those of you who are fascinated by "memetic engineering" would <br>
do well to consider the Holocaust meme as the canonical example.  <br>
If you can design a meme like that, you can take over the world... <br>
for a while.  But I think philosophy will prevail in the end.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
