I've been turning this over and over and can't seem to imagine a contract<br>
that doesn't involve _some_ reference to property rights.  It is possible to<br>
imagine a contract of "pure" personal service ... "I'll think for you about<br>
such-and-such a subject and tell you what I come up with for so many<br>
dollars," for instance.  But it seems that this contract can be translated<br>
into the statement: "I sell you the right to know what I think about<br>
such-and-such".  You now _own_ that right.  This may be a mere word game, but<br>
since property rights are obviously fundamental to more concrete<br>
transactions, what am I missing?<br>
