Ethics, when used in a rational sense, gives practical purpose to life while<br>
achieving individual interests.  Principles help in developing goals and in<br>
seeking out the realization of same goals.<br>
<p>
For me, the question pertains to "values."  They are a foundation for<br>
achieving optimal life.  If there is contradiction in my values, my choices<br>
in achieving goals could falter, causing reverberations that can be<br>
problematic down the road.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would it be based totally on achieving one's goals, or is there more to </i><br>

<p>
In that a goal is an object from which an endeavor is directed, a type of<br>
finish line -- how one gets there paints a good portrait.<br>
