<i>&gt;As I said on the page and preeviously, it has nothing whatsoever to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with so called "prepetual motion" "zero point energy" or any of that</i><br>
<i>&gt;other crap.</i><br>
<p>
Be careful what you throw into the "crap" category.  Despite being dirtied<br>
by the blatant abuse of crackpots, "zero point energy" (or perhaps more<br>
correctly, "Lorentz-invariant zero point fields") is a very real phenomenon<br>
and has significant implications both in propulsion and physics in general.<br>
It is directly responsible for real physical phenomenon such as Van der<br>
Waal's force and the Casimir force and generally permeates everything,<br>
including empty space (hence the alternatively used "Quantum Vacuum").<br>
<p>
The zero-point field (and its name) is based on initial work done by<br>
Einstein and Stern in 1913.  It was expanded by Nernst and Planck in the<br>
1920's.  Most of the additional theoretical work on the zero-point field<br>
phenomenon was done by the Russian physicists Sakharov and Puthoff in the<br>
1960's and 1970's as well as a some minor additions by a few other<br>
physicists in the '70s.  <br>
<p>
The real interesting developments came circa 1991 with some independant work<br>
by astrophysicists B. Haisch and A. Rueda on stochastic electrodynamics<br>
(SED).  They noticed a result in the mathematics that suggested that inertia<br>
(a la F=ma) may be a direct result of the zero-point field.  After<br>
contacting Puthoff and doing additional work, they developed some very<br>
interesting results.  For further information, Haisch, Rueda, Puthoff, and<br>
Sakharov have published several papers in Phys. Review A as well as other<br>
physics and science journals.<br>
<p>
(Warning: the mathematics in some of these papers is ghastly and quite<br>
possibly masochistic!  Read at your own risk!)<br>
<p>
The results and implication of their work in a nutshell:<br>
1)  The phenomenon known as inertia is a direct result of acceleration<br>
within the zero-point field.  Modifying the zero-point field would modify<br>
the inertial mass of an object.<br>
<p>
2)  The model, using the property of equivalence, can be shown to also be<br>
directly responsible for the gravitation phenomenon.  By modifying the<br>
zero-point field, you could arbitrarily modify the gravitational mass and<br>
effects of an object.<br>
<p>
Their papers have been well received by the physics community and have been<br>
generally considered very sound.  There are a couple uncertainties in the<br>
model they use that they have been steadily resolving.  The zero-point model<br>
*does* null certain expected (but as yet, untested) consequences of General<br>
Relativity.    NASA's Gravity Probe B, expected to be launched in 1998 will<br>
test some of the expected differences between the GR model and ZPF model of<br>
gravitation.<br>
<p>
The model is currently gaining favor in that it can explain many<br>
cosmological and physics mysteries that have been difficult to explain using<br>
the pure GR and QM models without really creating any.  <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, modifying the ZPF is difficult, or more precisely, no one is<br>
sure exactly how to do it.  It is difficult enough just measuring it.<br>
Empirical evidence based on experiments with single particles (such as<br>
electrons) seems to indicate that it is possible to modify the apparent mass<br>
of a particle through careful application of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
However, precise control or macroscopic application is currently (to my<br>
knowledge) unobtainable.  However, I understand that techniques and<br>
capabilities are becoming more refined.<br>
<p>
And how do I know so much about it?<br>
<p>
Because Lockheed-Martin, NASA, and DoD are all spending a lot of time and<br>
money on zero-point field research.  I know at least two of the above named<br>
physicists are currently working at Lockheed-Martin R&amp;D facilities.  And I<br>
have had the opportunity to see some of the experimental data in my tour<br>
with these agencies.<br>
<p>
I mean, who *wouldn't* be interested in the ability to arbitrarily modify<br>
inertial mass and gravitation?  The applications would be endless.<br>
