<i>&gt;Uh, I thought the cellular stuff was digital? The only artefacts being voice </i><br>
<i>&gt;compression alias?</i><br>
<p>
Most cellular is analog.  I have digital TDMA (?).  It's great until<br>
the signal goes below a certain level.  Fading out on an analog phone<br>
isn't too nice, but digitals just cut out completely.<br>
<p>
Big advantage: air time is 1/2 the cost, because they can carry 3x the<br>
conversations on the same cells (and pocket the 50% difference).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The usual good cell stuff has a standby of max 50 hours, I thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; standby for two days, or you can talk for four hours, or some combination</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4 hours? It's not too sensational.</i><br>
<p>
Bwaa haa haa.  My Nokia/AT&amp;T 6300 is 8 hours standby, something like<br>
30 minutes talking with the Ni-metal-hydride battery ($100 extra).<br>
<p>
The new model has software improvements which bump this to 20 hours<br>
standby and I don't know how many talking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Check out the Motorola website (must be <a href="http://www.motorola.com">http://www.motorola.com</a>), they've </i><br>
<i>&gt;progressed quite far Iridium-wise (which is just planetwide satellite </i><br>
<i>&gt;cellular), now they're trying to launch a Internet-thru-space</i><br>
<i>&gt;project, </i><br>
<p>
Huges has sateelite net access right now.  See www.direcpc.com (note<br>
no T).  I'm thinking of going for it in lieu of ISDN, but they never<br>
returned my email (bad sign), part of which asked if I can serve<br>
multiple IP addresses with it, by hooking it up to a WinNT-server<br>
machine and routing from it to my network.<br>
<p>
They only support Windoze machines at the moment.<br>
