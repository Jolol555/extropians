I was paraphrasing a view I disagree with, so I agree with you.  <br>
I should have been clearer - sorry.<br>

<i>&gt;       further, either through better computer hardware and software or by</i><br>

<i>&gt;leads to further increases via the third.</i><br>
<p>
I think I've been sloppy in my posts on this topic (especially the post that<br>
Peter McCluskey responded to), so let me try to do better.<br>
<p>
The three obvious contributors to the intelligence of the world economy are<br>
population size, the raw speed of human brains, and knowledge (both tacit and<br>
explicit).  While there are other constributors, such as some high level<br>
organizational issues, I doubt they are that important, and expect progress<br>
on improving them to be slow.<br>
<p>
Knowledge and population have been increasing for some time.  As the world<br>
economy grows, the more we know, the better we get at learning more, and the<br>
larger population we can support.  And being richer, we've been able to spend<br>
more on research, and on tools to aide research.  (Tools are really<br>
artificats that embody knowledge, in my view.)<br>
<p>
Computers are just one of those tools, and haven't really aided research much<br>
more than other important tools, like cars and air conditioning.  Progress in<br>
computers is driven by the size of the market for computers - the more<br>
computers folks buy, the more researchers are employed, and so the more ideas<br>
get tried out.  <br>
<p>
Thus we have had a feedback process of growth of knowledge (and tools) and<br>
population for some time.  The big change I see looming here is that of<br>
decreases in the cost, and increases in speed, of individual brains with<br>
uploads.  And especially the ability to make copies, which decreases the cost<br>
of filling new brains with knowledge (the big limit on our growth rate now).<br>
Since this should drive down the cost of labor, research gets cheaper, and so<br>
more should be done.<br>
<p>
As our technology of uploads improves, for the same price we can either make<br>
faster brains or more brains.  It is not obvious which option will be more<br>
preferred - the most important thing isn't brain speed but brain cost per<br>
speed.  In particular, research may get done by a few very fast very<br>
expensive brains, but I'd guess lots of slower brains to be the usual case.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I basically agree that a change we can envision will increase the<br>
growth rate, but I think folks are confused about the root cause.  The basic<br>
issue isn't brain speed, nor cost per speed.  Human brains are actually<br>
pretty cheap out there at the moment.  The big change is lowering the cost of<br>
creating knowledge-filled brains, with upload copies.<br>
<p>
If average brain speed goes up as the growth rate, the subjective effect to<br>
the participants may not be that different from today.<br>
<p>
(Is all this any clearer Peter?)<br>
