<i>&gt;defense of the U.S. govt because all the facts necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt;reach the this just revealed truth have been there from day</i><br>
<i>&gt;one (notice that this news comes from Reuters in England); and</i><br>
<i>&gt;this proves that the bulk of conspiracy researchers quickly and</i><br>
<i>&gt;accurately divulged the real scoop and were smeared viciously</i><br>
<i>&gt;for doing so. If you want to get closest to the truth, research</i><br>
<i>&gt;conspiracy theory sources.</i><br>
<p>
IRA to IAN: I hope this isn't interpreted as ad hominem abuse, but how does<br>
a statement from Pierre Salinger "prove" that Flight 800 was shot down by a<br>
U.S. Navy missile?  Excuse me if I point out a contradiction in your<br>
analysis: Pierre Salinger works for ABC News.  He is part of the "GovtMedia<br>
news feed."<br>
<p>
I am also at a loss to understand how Pierre Salinger, residing in Paris,<br>
has first-hand knowledge when hundreds of investigators off Long Island<br>
still appear to be mystified.<br>
<p>
However, if this theory does prove to be true, anyone who publicly<br>
ridiculed your analysis will owe you a public apology.<br>
<p>
But there is also still good reason to be skeptical about conspiracy<br>
theories in general and about whether the U.S. Navy shot down Flight 800 in<br>
particular.  More important, Pierre Salinger is an inveterate Statist who<br>
thinks France is a swell place to live; I will always treat his statements<br>
with a good deal of skepticism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hell, ya got to toot your horn a little, particularly after</i><br>
<i>&gt;being sh*t on so much for getting the truth out, for example:</i><br>
<p>
IRA to IAN: Isn't it a bit premature to proclaim victory?  Wasn't that a<br>
government agent who gave a "document" to a media agent?  Are you sure you<br>
want to bet everything on what a government agent -- whose original source<br>
and motivation remain unknown -- gave to media and ex-government agent<br>
Salinger (Pierre was part of the Kennedy Admin.)?<br>
<p>
Perhaps this is a conspiracy by the government to discredit Pierre<br>
Salinger!  If the government could shoot down a passenger airliner and<br>
cover it up, then there is no reason to assume that "shooting down" Pierre<br>
Salinger is beyond the intrigues of the FBI.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The current issue of GEORGE Magazine smears people who suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the govt may have shot-down TWA 800 as clueless paranoids.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They even quote me. Yet I gave them the facts, culled right out</i><br>
<i>&gt;of quickly disappearing media quotations, that 156 witnesses re-</i><br>
<i>&gt;ported seeing a missile hit the plane and GEORGE Magazine censored</i><br>
<i>&gt;these facts that they had in hand, and then they turn around and</i><br>
<i>&gt;call those who know the facts, which they also know, "clueless."</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's a naked con job.</i><br>
<p>
IRA to IAN: I confess I enjoy doing battle with clueless paranoids.  See<br>

However, as a dynamic optimist, I am not ready to write you off.  The rest<br>
of us could be wrong.  (However, if A =82 A then there is no truth for any o=<br>
f<br>
us.)  And, you often represent a provocative and opposing view that, if it<br>
didn't exist, we would have to invent.<br>
<p>
So, as a budding fellow extropian (and owner of a three-letter name<br>
beginning with "I"), I refuse to believe you are all bad. &lt;g&gt;<br>
