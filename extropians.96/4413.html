In the context of "a spreading cloud of interstellar civilization", <br>
with David Musick's (9 Dec 1996) goal of a "point of no return" <br>
(civilization having passed any Great Filter, such that the <br>
probability of extinction is very low, (short of "The Arrival Of The <br>
Great Handkerchief", of course :)), on 20 Dec 1996 Anders Sandberg <br>
wrote:<br>
&lt;This could be just a slow expansion [of lingering colonists] ... or <br>
it could be a blazing expansion of von Neumann probes. A disaster able <br>
to wipe out the entire technosphere would have to overrun it. If the <br>
technosphere spreads close to lightspeed, then any catastrophy moving <br>
at lightspeed (like vacuum decay) will take a very long time to <br>
devastate all of the technosphere.&gt;<br>
<p>
The challenge I see here is that there might have to be a 'speciation' <br>
between any 'lingering colonists' and the probe 'wave-front'.  I'm <br>
assuming that the wave-front probes could only have 'one' goal if they <br>
were to be able to expand at ~lightspeed: grab resources, replicate <br>
(if necessary) while *always* on the move. That is, they would not <br>
have time to stop and 'smell the flowers', analyze the environment, or <br>
design anything new.  They would have to leave behind non-probe <br>
'seeds' that would grow to fullfill these more leisurely functions. <br>
These lingering colonists would be the ones that would have time to <br>
actually interact with their environment, create art and design new <br>
technologies.  Maybe the difference between the two groups would be <br>
more like sexual genders than different species?<br>
<p>
If this scenario is valid then perhaps *creative* intelligence might <br>
only reside in the 'lingering' colonists, who would, of course, be <br>
free to mount their own explorations as well, just not with the speed <br>
and persistence of their probe ancestors.<br>
<p>
Would there be any possibility for the always-moving-on probes to ever <br>
learn from the environment (other than reflex reactions, such as <br>
avoiding clouds of antimatter or blasts of lethal radiation)? Would <br>
there be any way (or even need) for the probes and colonists to <br>
communicate and adapt based on each other's knowledge?<br>
<p>
I recall one 'race' of beings from Olaf Stapledon's _Star Maker_ where <br>
there were two symbiotic 'species' (maybe they were just different <br>
'larval' stages of the same species?): One part staying at home (sort <br>
of like whales, if I recall), creating works of art and dreams, based <br>
on the messages sent back by their more mobile counterparts. So, the <br>
lingering colonists could learn (though not in real-time) from the <br>
experiences of the wave-front; but, there might not be any way for the <br>
learning lingerers to provide feed-back to the manically-expanding <br>
probes if the latter were always pushing on at ~lightspeed.<br>
<p>
Perhaps there are ways around my assumption that the expanding <br>
wave-front would not have time to adapt and learn new things?  I <br>
assume that, even at lightspeed, the probes would still be subject to <br>
evolutionary pressures and would be 'blindly' selected/adapted in that <br>
way. Still, I can't see any way for the probes to learn anything from <br>
those they left behind. Maybe they wouldn't need to as long as they <br>
continued to carry on the seeds necessary to create more colonists?<br>
<p>

P.S. Perhaps these considerations point towards something like a <br>
'Shaper/Mechanist' bifurcation such as Bruce Sterling envisioned in <br>
his 10-year old transhumanist/cyberpunk classic, _Schismatrix_, which, <br>
BTW, has *just* been republished, with additional stories, as <br>
_Schismatrix Plus_.<br>
