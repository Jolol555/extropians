Yes, but I never said memory and consciousness were identical, I did say they<br>
were both based on information. There's a lot more to information than just <br>
memory.              <br>

Suppose I show you 2 people, you talk and get to know them, then I then take <br>
them away and upload them. One I Upload very gradually under conditions you <br>
would consider ideal, the other one I upload instantaneously with my gamma ray <br>
pulse laser. Now I show you the 2 uploads and let you ask them any question <br>
and perform any test you like. Is there any way you could determine which one <br>
was uploaded quickly and which one was not? If the Scientific Method can not <br>
find any difference we must conclude that there is no difference, or we will <br>
sink into the swamp of metaphysics and superstition.<br>
