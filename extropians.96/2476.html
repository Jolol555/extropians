Steven Brust's _The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars_ has nothing to do with<br>

(on David(?) and other French Revolution artists/propagandists) (the<br>
narrator-painter doesn't like Art With a Message): "Maybe because they<br>

"What's the point of anti-nuclear art?  It doesn't tell anyone anything<br>
new.  Nukes are bad, everyone agrees."<br>
