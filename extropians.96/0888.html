Remember! you can use compression! You could compress the Earth quite easily<br>
because there is so much redundant data and yes, you could possibly use<br>
quantum switches or molecular circuits and memory. Imagine how many<br>
terabytes that would require?<br>

So? All we need is for the necessary laws of physics to be present and<br>
anything beyond that is unnecessary. Like I'm sure dark matter has a direct<br>
effect on our planet other than gravity pull.(sarcasm)<br>
