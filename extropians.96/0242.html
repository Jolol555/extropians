I think economic pressure will merely tend to pronounce the patients to <br>
be incurable... Already hitech medicine inflicts a heavy, soon likely to <br>
grow intolerably high financial drain upon the populace/medical insurance <br>
of leading industrial countries. As the age histo distribution grows <br>
increasingly skewed &amp; skeweder, medical costs are bound to explode (and <br>
they do).<br>

<p>
Silicon photolitho 2d circuitry is totally insuitable for brain <br>
augmentation emplants, both in terms of integration density (number of <br>
neurons substituted) and computational power (since you can't go totally <br>
maspar because of low physical connectivity).<br>
<p>
This asks for 3d quantum dot arrays/molecular circuitry + advanced active <br>
cooling which ain't yet exactly there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Once people start using silicon neural-nets to expand and enhance normal</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain function, one can imagine a smooth path to a point in which one's</i><br>
<p>
1) I doubt it will be neural nets, more likely we will see coupling of <br>
   brittle computer algebra packages (Mathematica, MatLab, etc.) first.<br>
   bioNN computational prowess is pretty awesome -- we'll need some time<br>
   to approach this order of magnitude. Complementary skills.<br>
<p>
2) It is _not_ smooth, as additional circuitry installation is grainy -- <br>
   you plug in new modules<br>
<p>
I once thought one might design a protein-based molecular circuitry, <br>
which induces a soft upload by "infecting" the brain, autoreplicating,<br>
scanning neurons and substituting them for crystalline protein molecular <br>
circuitry to emulate the orginal neuron functionality.<br>
<p>
Alas, apart from more trivial reasons, the integration density <br>
achievable with soft nanotech does not permit scanning/substituting at this <br>
level. If _at all_, it might be only feasible with strong nanotech <br>
(Drexlerian nanoassemblers), which' feasibility has not been shown <br>
sufficiently yet. (Though speculative technology can be fun, we ought not <br>
to cross over in the realm of the improbable or even mythical).<br>
<p>
If this fine-grain incremental upload is infeasible, merely beckoning to <br>
the surviving set of strange attractors constituting your personality <br>
with virgin circuitry will depend on their evolution-shaped propensity to <br>
cross over into new territory. Since this never happens in real life (though <br>
lesion tolerance &amp; recovery is based on semi-dormant, redundant circuitry <br>
taking over the part of vanquished one), it is not likely to work. <br>
(However, the faint possibility that it might be possible should be <br>
sufficient to spawn off an research task force to shed some light on this <br>
difficult subject).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "identity" has gradually moved "into" the silicon prostheses, because</i><br>
<p>
I doubt identity has the properties of a liquid. (If it had, it would be <br>
extremely nice of the evolution to provide us with it without <br>
evolutionary fitness requiring such a useful trait).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; eventually there would simply be more and faster computational power on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosthesis side. The sorts of computational structures that neural networks</i><br>
<i>&gt; support (minds, in this case) can be extremely protean and flexible.</i><br>
<p>
Alas, I have grown to distrust this Proteus guy (... you never know who he'll <br>
be next ;). Most neuroscientists I know are highly sceptical about <br>
unbound malleability of cerebral circuitry. If incremental soft uploads are <br>
possible at all, they won't come before Singularity -- and that will be too <br>
late. Contrary to Vinge's headbands, I doubt we'll see much of it prior to <br>
Singularity, when every single rule is likely to be broken -- including <br>
the necessity to rely on headbands (or heads).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The logical end result of this technology path would be something similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Greg Egan's "jewel" or Ndoli device. I don't think the possibility of</i><br>
<i>&gt; soft incremental uploads can be so easily dismissed until after we learn</i><br>

I am sorry if I should have given the impression of my dismissal as easy,<br>
I should have given arguments.<br>
