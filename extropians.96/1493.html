Yes I did. I'm a fairly lazy and disorganized person, and I tend to<br>
believe<br>
(probably incorrectly) that much of humanity falls into the same<br>
category.<br>
If I dropped out of the economy, I would not be able to enjoy a<br>
comfortable<br>
lifestyle today without effort. I assert that with MNT, I would be able<br>
to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without effort. The "without effort" is<br>
the<br>
difference. This means that I can spend my time doing what I want to do<br>
to<br>
satisfy myself, rather than doing what has the highest economic return.<br>
Note<br>
that today a person selects a job by making a tradeoff between<br>
non-monetary<br>
personal satisfaction and monetary gain. I assert that MNT will cause<br>
this<br>
tradeoff to shift entirely away from monetary gain for many people,<br>
causing<br>
them to effectively leave the economy.<br>
