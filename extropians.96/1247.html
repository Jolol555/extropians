<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Regarding the cover-up conspiracies of a Navy missile shooting down</i><br>
<i>&gt; TWA 800.  Is this relevant for the issue of government cover-ups?  Or is</i><br>
<i>&gt; there something extropian I'm missing.  Being a Washingtonian, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowing plenty of people in gov, I can tell you, they're just people.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; the military is just people too, with a somewhat lower mean IQ than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other gov departments.  The idea that people who work for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government *suddenly* have the ability and resources to cover-up the</i><br>

<p>
In general, I agree with this, yet it appears the gov't has the ability to<br>
keep embarrassing things secret for some time. Combined with {in}|{unin}-<br>
tentional lack of media coverage, things can be kept out of the public eye for<br>
many years. Consider the recent coverage of forgotten Korean War prisoners.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the truth wil be revealed only after new antiterrorism laws are<br>
passed in the wake of TWA 800.<br>
<p>
I don't think the US govt intentionally sets out to kill large numbers of<br>
the citizenry (maybe with certain exceptions). Using whatever events come<br>
along to further their own ends, maybe they're good at that.<br>
