Actually, the effect my drive uses is analogous, on a macroscopic scale,<br>
to the effect the Casimir effect has on electrons between the plates.<br>
They wind up running in a similar manner. This effect was discovered by<br>
Dr. Thomas Townsend Brown in the early 20's, and culminated in a project<br>
for the Air Force and the Rand Corporation called Project Winterhaven in<br>
the early 50's. WHile his devices utilizing the effect could only<br>
generate a propulsive force in the order of 2% of the mass of the<br>
plates, the reseach showed that utilizing dielectric materials in the<br>
order of and above 10,000 k ( NOT Kelvin), which were not in existence<br>
at the time (and I'm not sure if they exist currently) and with voltages<br>
above around 75,000 volts would provide significant increases in Casimir<br>
influence on electrons occillating in assymetrical orbits in the<br>
dielectric, thus increasing the thrust to weight ratio of the device.<br>
While it is not a pure Casimir device, i.e. the space bewteen the plates<br>
is not less than a Planck length, it does through brute force utilize<br>
the effect.<br>
<p>
 While the Brown device uses electrons in asymetrical orbits to generate<br>
force, I simply use whole chunks of grounded mass to achieve the same<br>
result. I expect that a Brown type device would be more efficient, but<br>
probably won't be able to reach very high thrust to weight ratios to use<br>
for launchers, as the device uses electrons with their extremely low<br>
mass, while my device uses the whole atom, which has hugely larger mass.<br>
<p>
Of course, as the performance is a result of F=(mv^2)/r, a change in<br>
velocity would have a much greater impact on output. As electrons are<br>
much easier to accelerate to higher velocities, with a high enough k<br>
value in the dielectric, any thrust could be possible. This would<br>
neccessitate development of all temperature superdielectric materials,<br>
which would probably be a similar technological feat as high temp<br>
superconductors ( which would probably be wanted for use in the plates.)<br>
<p>
Additionally as the radius of the particle orbits in a Casimir Device<br>
are subatomic, this obviously also amplifies the thrust produced.<br>
