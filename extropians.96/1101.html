<i>&gt; The 'official' argument is in Ayn Rand's collection of essays 'The Voice of</i><br>

I think this is bullshit. I am fairly Libertarian, and I am strongly pro <br>
capitalism. Maximizing individual freedom has no intrinsic value. It is <br>
the maximization of in toto (over population, over time) happiness which <br>
has value. Why? Because because because because because because. Infinite <br>
regress. No rational reason. As it happens, at least in my case is full <br>
congruency between ratio and emotion. Unless you are a freak, this is not <br>
a coincidence. Humans are just doing things. Some of it is random modulated, <br>
but most of it is an artefact of genetic or memetic history. Rational <br>
beings fared better in the past. We tend to be rational, being the <br>
descendants of survivors. Irrationality is also instrumental, as it helps <br>
to avoid becoming trapped in local optima. All your actions form the <br>
context for your co-humans, and vice versa. This defines an evolutionary <br>
theatre. Certain boundary conditions given, it artefacts progressively <br>
benign cooperation, albeit nonlinear. ALife computer runs show this. (This <br>
had better be true, or this universe sucks noticeably).<br>
<p>
Darwin, the great determinant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or ignoring the underlying philosophical foundations: objective reality,</i><br>
<p>
What is objective reality? How can I learn anything about it, but through <br>
my senses, and augmentary senses (gadgets), which translate things <br>
outside my sphere of experience into a language I can understand. <br>
Plato's cave. Is there an outside? That we _feel_ there is something out <br>
there is but the artefact of the process by which we are generated: the <br>
Darwinian evolution. Would we be randomly jumbled, we wouldn't be able to <br>
agree on anything common, because there would be no overlap. We wouldn't <br>
even be able to communicate the insight.<br>
<p>
The search for objective reality resembles the quest for the Holy Grail.<br>
With a single difference: there is no Grail. Even if it was, we wouldn't <br>
know, and even if we did it would make no difference.<br>
<p>
This is very like the Achilles/Tortoise paradoxon. It is insubstantial, <br>
yet it had kept many men thinking about it. To no avail. So let's drop it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; knowledge and ethics. They can therefore not logically and morally defend</i><br>
<p>
Knowledge: a bag of tricks. Ethics: cooperation emergence due to <br>
evolution pressure. Deterministic as hell.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; personal and economic freedom, nor do they have the tools to rationally</i><br>
<i>&gt; define or resolve political issues.</i><br>
<p>
I dunno... Going for the right goals, but for wrong reasons? What's wrong <br>
with that? These objectivists are certainly not utilitarists. But they <br>
are certainly irrational.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I completely agree with this criticism. However, for me it does not follow</i><br>
<i>&gt; that libertarians are 'more evil than communists' - I just think that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are mistaken in rejecting rational ethics. Objectivists' hatred seems to be</i><br>
<p>
Ratio has no inherent value but instrumentality. There is no value <br>
outside the human system. Many things are meaningless, if taken out of <br>
context. So is meaning. (I must be a Darwinian utilitarist nihilist <br>
Libertarian, or something like that).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; an irrational, non-objective over-reaction born out of contempt for</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians who 'should know better', who are 'traitors to Objectivism' and</i><br>
<i>&gt; who, in any case should have recognized Ayn Rand as their leader.</i><br>
<p>
All in all, they sound like a funny bunch. But, being an utilitarist, I <br>
have no problems with that ;)<br>
