Suppose an exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, <br>
were made a billion light years away. The duplicate world <br>
would need some sort of feedback mechanism to keep the worlds <br>
in synchronization, non linear effects would amplify tiny variations, <br>
even quantum fluctuations, into big differences, but this is just a <br>
thought experiment so who cares. In the first two cases below the results <br>
would vary according to personalities, remember there's a lot of illogic <br>
even in the best of us.<br>
<p>
1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum<br>
   to my head and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains<br>
   out, am I concerned ? You bet I am because I know that your<br>
   double is holding an identical gun to the head of my double and<br>
   making an identical threat.<br>
<p>
2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds <br>
   will diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but <br>
   my double will be spared, am I concerned? Yes, and angry as well, <br>
   in times of intense stress nobody is very logical. My double is <br>
   no longer exact because I am going through a traumatic experience <br>
   and my double is not. I'd be looking at that huge gun and wondering <br>
   what it will be like when it goes off, and if death will really be <br>
   instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my philosophy was really as sound <br>
   as I thought it was, and I'd also be wondering why I get the bullet and <br>
   not my double, and cursing the unfairness of it all. My (semi) double <br>
   would be thinking "it's a shame about that other fellow but I'm glad <br>
   it's not me".<br>
<p>
3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads <br>
   and we are both convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, <br>
   making a hell of a mess, but the other gun for inexplicable reasons <br>
   misfires. In this case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying <br>
   experience I am completely unharmed.         <br>
   <br>
                                         <br>
