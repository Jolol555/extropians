You know, don't take this the wrong way, but this "extropy" business<br>
seems likely to degenerate into a cultish, self-righteous restatement of<br>
goals that should be acheived by sober, dry, scientific thought.<br>
<p>
How about if we just say that Extropy is "the belief that ridiculously<br>
high technology is a good thing" instead of listing two hundred positive<br>
attributes that have nothing whatsoever to do with Extropy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The current definition is" "Extropy -- the extent of a person's or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture's intelligence, information, vitality, diversity, opportunity, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; [personal] growth." "Personal" might be removed since it fits with person</i><br>
<i>&gt; but not very well with culture.</i><br>
<p>
Many intelligent people are not Extropians.  Many well-informed people<br>
are not Extropians.  My vitality is as close to zero as a human can get<br>
without falling over.  There's only one of me.  Many Extropians are<br>
leading low-opportunity lives and the majority of high-opportunity<br>
people are not Extropians, a double dissociation.  Most people who are<br>
exhibiting personal growth are going through life-defining experiences<br>
that have nothing to do with a belief in high technology.<br>
<p>
Certainly your list might make a fine "To-Do" list of things that<br>
Extropians should do and might be good at, but as a *definition* I'd<br>
have to say that it's a smugly self-righteous failure.<br>
