<i>&gt;in the December, 1996 issue of Wired magazine pushing this idea.  He</i><br>

<i>&gt;He is also, as a result, against the use of cryptography and similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies to protect privacy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I exchanged a few letters with him on this topic two years ago, but neither</i><br>
<i>&gt;of us managed to change the other's mind.  I think it is such a totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;misguided notion that it was hard even to find ground to discuss it.</i><br>
<p>
Let me defend Brin.  The main point he is making is that a huge loss<br>
in privacy is inevitable, and we need to start addressing this fact ASAP.<br>
Maybe crypto will allow certain kinds of privacy that weren't possible<br>
before, but to see this as leading to a "golden age of privacy" is to<br>
tragically miss the big picture.  <br>
<p>
Now let me criticize Brin.  In his 12/96 Wired article Brin is not<br>
sufficiently clear about what our choices are, nor does he<br>
sufficiently defend his claims about choices.  Brin says that it is<br>
inevitable that most of us will be viewed by cameras while we walk<br>
about in public, and "the proliferation of vast databases ... about<br>
our lives, habits, tastes, and personal histories."<br>
<p>
But he says we can still choose whether or not the public knows that<br>
they are so watched, whether there are cameras in police stations, and<br>
whether cameras are banned from many indoor places.  Brin claims that<br>
if we choose to have privacy laws, the consequence of such a choice<br>
would be "to prevent you and me from learning anything about the rich<br>
and powerful".<br>
<p>
The obvious question is: why are these the choices?  Why is the one<br>
set open to change and the other set not?  Without hearing some<br>
reasoning in defense of this division, it is hard to take Brin's<br>
analysis very seriously.  <br>
