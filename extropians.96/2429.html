WE should decide what WE want! If we take medications which shouldn't be<br>
mixed and kill ourselves, it's OUR DAMN FAULT! We should look for the<br>
information ourselves. There are too many people for our government to take<br>
care of. Now we must take care of ourselves. Think of it this way: People<br>
who don't research the medications they're about to take and get fatal side<br>
effects deserved it! We cannot be responsible for everyone and protect<br>
people from themselves! And there is one nice side effect to this whole<br>
thing! This process filters out all the stupid people who didn't think<br>
before they acted and thus died. <br>

I am now prepared to get responses from people calling me 'heartless'.<br>
