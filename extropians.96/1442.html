<p>
When I read "Engines of Creation," I ended up with the same feeling you<br>
have. I therefore bought "Nanosystems" and read it (reasonably)<br>
carefully.<br>
I feel that I have enough technical background to evaluate Drexler's<br>
arguments in "Nanosystems", except for the thermodynamics. I found the<br>
arguments convincing. I consider the proposition <br>
  A) "a MNT factory can build another MNT factory"<br>
to be proven in theory. I consider the proposition <br>
  B) "given a MNT assembler, we can build a MNT factory"<br>
to be proven in theory. I consider the proposition<br>
  C) "We know  how to build the first MNT assembler without using MNT"<br>
to be unproven. However, I appears to me to be likely. It's therefore an<br>
assumption in my line of reasoning.<br>
<p>
My discussions with Robin lead to explicit statement of the following<br>
additional proposition:<br>
   D) "we will develop capable MNT design software."<br>
This is not proven, so you may treat it as a premise. I'll call it a<br>
professional judgement.<br>
<p>
Now, My various random posts may not constitute a formal proof, but<br>
I feel that C and D lead to A and B. I also feel that A, B, and D lead<br>
to rapid feedback, economic meltdown, and the Singularity.<br>
