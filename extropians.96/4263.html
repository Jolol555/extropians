<i>&gt; But again, Brin is making 2 fundamental errors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) He's assuming that everyone, including chicks, will be just like him and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    equate privacy with paranoia.</i><br>
<p>
Not just paranoia, but danger. Fear is generated by the unknown. In a<br>
world where all else was open, those who tried to hide their actions<br>
would be feared. The social pressure caused by the people hosting the<br>
"transparency meme" reinforces the meme and creates an ESS. A child<br>
raised in such a society would never see the posible benefits of hiding<br>
their actions. A mutant genius who does see the advantages will most<br>
likely be destroyed or rendered impotent. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) He's assuming that by some black magic everyone, including chicks, can</i><br>
<i>&gt;    tell if I'm using cryptography, but in actuality, the fact that I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;    secret is a secret.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Are we talking about actions or words here? Secrets held unused are<br>
worthless. Do you have some black magic by which you can make use of a<br>
secret without revealing its existence?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose I run the best small painting company in silicon valley, we can do a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better job at a lower price than anyone else, but through black magic it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; known that I have a secret.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you really think INTEL wouldn't hire my company to paint the outside of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their new chip manufacturing plant?</i><br>
<p>
They most certainly would not, given that a transparency ESS holds.<br>
<p>
In the current ESS I can probably gain economic advantage through the<br>
use of slave labor, but no one will buy my products or services when<br>
they find out about my business practices.<br>
<p>
Try telling INTEL that you have a gang of slaves fresh off the boat that<br>
you are going to send over to paint their plant just as well as the<br>
competition will but at half the price, and see what happens.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The increased tolerance of the society I described would</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;apply to everything except your privacy. In your above</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;example you would at best be shunned and at worst killed</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;out of fear</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds like a splendid place to live, I can hardly wait.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Will your crypto-anarchy protect those who use slave labor? If so, I can<br>
hardly wait.<br>
<p>
<p>
All of your arguments are valid under the current ESS. All of mine (and<br>
Brins) come into play only under one that does not yet exist. That is<br>
why it is difficult for you to accept them. It is very hard to break<br>
away from a strange attractor once you are in its zone of influence.<br>
<p>
Perhaps one day soon our society will emerge from this ICE-age of<br>
secrecy and deception into the warm greenness of transparency and<br>
tolerance!<br>
<p>
(Sorry, I couldn't resist. ;-) )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Brin wants to write his book in an intellectual cocoon, isolated from any </i><br>
<i>&gt; disturbing ideas that might challenge his own. </i><br>
<p>
In fact, personally, I find the whole transparency meme pretty<br>
abhorrent. But then I too am a product of current societal  pressures.<br>
I'm sure that Brin is either "in an intellectual cocoon" or he’s a<br>
mutant genius (or both.) He avoided the pressures of current thinking<br>
and grasped the possibility for a workable transparency ESS. I certainly<br>
didn't see it without his help.<br>
<p>
The real question is not whether a transparent society is possible (I<br>
think it is, but if it isn’t then we needn’t worry about it.) but<br>
whether it is "better or worse." Should we actively strive to push<br>
society one way or the other, or just let chaos do its trick unfetterd<br>
by the additional effects our self referential proccesses?<br>
