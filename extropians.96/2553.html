In a message dated 96-11-04 21:33:42 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;  Businesses can thrive quite well even if they don't serve the<br>
consumers. <br>
 they can subsist solely on the desires of the wealthy.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Now you are saying the wealthy can't be customers in your society!?  It would<br>
be illegal for me to sell to the wealthy?   <br>
<p>
You don't want _anybody_ to be wealthy.  No matter how hard they work.  You<br>
want us all to be equally poor.  You want class warfare?  And, you want the<br>
poor to win so that there are only poor people left in your society?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; If you make  something only the people who can afford it want, then that's<br>
all that <br>
 matters. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
What's wrong with that?  Isn't the whole idea to make something your<br>
customers can afford?  <br>
<p>
You want me to make only things that _who_ wants?  Only the people who can't<br>
afford it?  I guess airplanes, cars, Ringworld, computers and spacecraft are<br>
out of the picture in your society.  <br>
<p>
So in your society I can sell ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T afford it.  It is<br>
illegal for me to sell to a person who CAN afford to pay.   You don't want me<br>
to sell _anything_ do you?  You don't believe in ANY private property at all.<br>
 <br>
<p>
It's probably also illegal for me to work for a rich business person.<br>
<p>
