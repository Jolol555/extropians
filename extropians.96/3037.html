When I consider the future, I do not passively sit back and believe everything <br>
will turn out alright.  I realize that I have great influence over the course <br>
my life takes.  I believe most events our out of my control, and I cannot say <br>
with certainty that things will go well for me.  But I do have the <br>
determination and am developing the discipline to influence whatever I can to <br>
cause things to work for my benefit.<br>
<p>
Dynamic Optimism is about shifting the odds in our favor.  It's not about <br>
sitting back passively and believing that things will turn out fine on their <br>
own.  It's about taking an active role in reality and influencing whatever we <br>
can to nudge reality to be more the way we want it to be.  <br>
<p>
Dynamic Optimism is about taking advantage of whatever opportunities present <br>
themselves to us, rather than letting them slip away, untouched.<br>
<p>
Dynamic Optimism is about training oneself to make good decisions when faced <br>
with choices.  We cannot always control what selection of choices we have to <br>
choose among, but we can learn to consistently choose the best options of <br>
those available to us.<br>
<p>
We don't know that things will turn out well for us, but we use our dynamic <br>
optimism to make the best of what we have.  We are optimistic that we can <br>
improve our situations, whatever they are.  We will *find* and *create* ways <br>
to improve our situations.<br>
<p>
Dynamic Optimism is optimism in *ourselves*.  We are optimistic that we are <br>
capable of improving things for ourselves.  We are dynamic, flexible and <br>
innovative in our approaches to accomplishing our goals, and we are optimistic <br>
in our abilities to achieve our goals consistently.<br>
