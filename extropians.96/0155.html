Ammonium nitrate sitting in a tub inside a truck could not be effectively<br>
directed against the building.  Some experts have claimed the pattern of<br>
damage on the Murrah building would not have been caused by a bomb that<br>
dispersed its energy in all direction....the ground would make much of the<br>
blast go upward.  The crater was very shallow as compared to the TNT Saudi<br>
bomb which created a 5-6 foot crater, yet the damage penetrated far into<br>
the Murrah building Ammonium nitrate w/fuel oil apparently does not ignite<br>
as fast as TNT.  The bomb in Saudi Arabia tho much more potent only<br>
ripped the facing off the building.  It did not penetrate much into the<br>
building as did the OKC bomb.<br>

<i>&gt; The analysis is correct for free standing columns, since the only bending</i><br>
<i>&gt; moments are due to the difference in applied pressure along the beam.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However in a building, the connection to the floors provides bending fulcrums</i><br>
<i>&gt; which allow part of the concrete to be put in tension, causing the concrete to</i><br>
<i>&gt; break since it has little tensile strength. The connections to outside concrete</i><br>
<i>&gt; walls provide broad surfaces for the blast pressure to act over that couple</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly well to the columns. The reinforcing iron is started bending as well,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and having lost the compression bearing structure of the concrete, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; buckles under the weight of the upper floors. The explosive doesn't have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the impulse to sever the beams, it undermines them and the weight of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; upper floors does the rest. During the falling of a building, some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; re-bars will be placed under tremendous tension, and sheared along their width.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That damage looks superficially similiar to the tearing produced by a nearby</i><br>
<i>&gt; charge of high explosive along one side of the beam.</i><br>
<p>
The column damage was supposedly "powedering" as occurs when charges are<br>
fastened directly to the column, not bending fractures.<br>
<p>
I repeat this info without much back-up other than reading a lot of<br>
articles suppossed experts questioning the Establishment line.<br>
<p>
The building should not have been destroyed so fast!  Perhaps the most<br>
suspicious aspect of the government investigation!<br>
