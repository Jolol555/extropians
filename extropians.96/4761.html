The Squirrel recalls a Scrooge McDuck comic book in which the Beagle<br>
Boys were going to blackmail the world by painting the Moon black so<br>
that no one could see it.  Just think of the economic impact on<br>
songwriters, justices of the peace, sellers of anti-werewolf defense<br>
systems, and so on.  Their evil plan was thwarted in mid-execution by<br>
Donald and the kids, and the Beagles sentenced to Luna, with paint <br>
remover and mops, to restore things to normal.<br>
<p>
The Squirrel, being an amateur astronomer, was actually rooting for<br>
the Beagle Boys.  When the Moon is up, it interferes with the<br>
visibility of most other things of interest to such hobbyists.<br>
<p>
As far as feasibility, it was going to take a fair amount of paint.<br>
