<p>
There are two problems with messy crypto algorithms.<br>
<p>
1) They tend to be slow. DES is extremely complex and extremely slow, a <br>
   serious problem if you want to encrypt a lot of data like video.<br>
<p>
2) In an algorithm that is large, complex and messy, it's very easy to make a  <br>
   blunder. When you add yet another wheel within a wheel you may think you're   <br>
   making it more secure, but you may be doing the opposite, it's hard to <br>
   know how the change will react with all the other parts of a very messy <br>
   algorithm. You may have actually have created a small hole in the system<br>
   through which an attacker can extract a little piece of information, <br>
   information he shouldn't have, information he can use to expand the hole <br>
   until he can drive a truck through it.<br>
   <br>
You certainly want your crypto function to have an extremely complex output, <br>
but that doesn't mean that the function itself must be complex. The very first <br>
computer program I ever wrote had as its output what some have said is the <br>
most complex object in mathematics, The Mandelbrot Set, yet It was easy and <br>
just a few lines long, it only took me a few minutes to write and I didn't <br>
know which way was up. Things are different now, I've purchased an up <br>
indicator.<br>
<p>
The IDEA algorithm is just the opposite of DES, it's small, fast and elegant, <br>
yet is almost certainly more secure than DES. RC4 is incredibly simple, <br>
yet is very nonlinear, has no cycles that anybody can find, and can be in  <br>
256!*256^2 states, that's about 2^1700. If RC4 has flaws it can't have many, <br>
it's just too simple to hide more than a few, a complex algorithm has room to<br>
hide tons of bugs because nobody understands very well how the damn thing  <br>
works.<br>
