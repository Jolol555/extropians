Yeah, the circum-black-smoker ecosystem is kinda fascinating... H_2S-linked <br>
life frolicking in a heavy metal soup, truly cool. Giant poganophores. <br>
Elsewhere: Christ, yukky spaghetti bacteria. And archae, the weirdest <br>
bugs of them all. (Them archae are of the greatest significance, whether to <br>
pure or applied science. Remember where TAC Polymerase came from? Big $$$'s).<br>

<p>
Current estimates say beyond 150 deg C hydrolysis rate rises alarmingly, <br>
so it's kinda safe to suppose no beastie (as we know it) can live beyond <br>
160 deg C, or so. This said, current book dogma supposes (primitive) life to <br>
extend several km into the crust, which was hilarious just a few years back.<br>

<p>
I'm pretty wary concerning the LGM bacteria... I'd rather investigate the <br>
Jovian and Saturnian satellite, some of them have lots of liquid water, <br>
and funky compounds on the surface/solution. It may well have some kind of <br>
life, at least precursors of it. What's the branch, exobiology/exochemistry (?)<br>
That's where we should be poking about, not this stupid Mars. <br>
<p>
I certainly can't understand all the fascination with the fourth plant. <br>
Sending men to Mars? What for? Rather a couple of tiny probes into the inner <br>
system, and _for God's sake_, let's start sending autoreplicators to the <br>
Moon/asteroids. Industrial processes in high-luminance, hard vacuum <br>
areas, that must be serious fun.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; [ ... snip .... ]</i><br>

<i>&gt; Life is less fragile than even _I_ think it is.  In 1975, I though I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; mighty optimistic.   I've spent my professional life for 20 years researching</i><br>
<i>&gt; microbial control and bacterium, yeast and mold cell injury "natural"</i><br>
<i>&gt; recovery mechanisms.  I then develop methods to "artificially"  (another</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolving word) recover injured cells.  I'm constantly amazed at life's</i><br>
<i>&gt; resiliency.  Based on what I've seen I would not be surprised if human</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryonic suspension works.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, wouldn't that involve tolerating macroscopic cracks? I mean hardy, <br>
and all that, but it's a bit much for a higher organism. The O. Visser <br>
breakthrough (if indeed...) looks good enough, but look at the size, and, <br>
more importantly, the kind of the organ desuspended. Cryonics is all about <br>
brain preservation, and the brain is pretty different from a bag of stupid  <br>
smooth/striated musculature. Also, it's a lot larger than the average rat <br>
heart (on the second thought... nah, skip that), has uniquely high <br>
phospholipid content, and lots of vascular lumen almost begging to nucleate <br>
ice growth. I'd rather go for clean EEG/MEG fingerprint, than a bit of <br>
muscle contraction.<br>
<p>
I can imagine running a destructive (AFM/sublimation enhanced contrast/UV <br>
laser nonthermal ablation) scan of a vitrified cerebrum, winding up with <br>
a (somewhat large) voxel set, which runs through several stages of <br>
de-freeze-artefacting ANN filters.... Whether you use that to fashion an <br>
upload model, or build a brain (and a body to match) with nanotech from <br>
scratch is up to you.<br>
<p>
But just just HF-flash-devitifying the poor brain pan contents, <br>
expecting it to work... I dunno. It sounds a lot like Mary Shelley, or a <br>
neocannibal kitchen recipe (but it will be sickly sweet due to <br>
residual polyol content and it's probably unsafe due to possible prion <br>
presence, so rather don't).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; DNA studies make me think the extreme thermophils are one of the first like</i><br>
<i>&gt; forms and were not adaptations of later life forms.  If this is true, cells</i><br>
<i>&gt; were assembled, adapted (evolved) while under extreme environmental pressure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  This could mean life is abundant in the Universe and in places we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; expect it to be.</i><br>
<p>
That's the current dogma, but why this darned Silence in the Skies, then!?<br>
I don't buy all the Great Filters, and Transcension looks more than a bit <br>
like a deus ex machina... Have we overlooked something obvious? Must we <br>
send interstellar probes into our immediate vicinity to find out, or will <br>
system-local investigations tell us enough?<br>
