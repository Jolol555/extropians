Wade, this sounds exciting! Once the project gets started, perhaps Extropy<br>
Institute can help by prominently linking to it from ExI's web site, and by<br>
connecting you with people who could help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, I realize a lot of this sounds ambitious, but basically the only areas</i><br>

<i>&gt;fleshing out multi-user VRML, and development of autonomous agents. But with</i><br>

<p>
That's not the only thing holding things back, and this matter is a major<br>
reason for this post: I've seen quite a few projects talked about, and some<br>
of them even started, but very few get very far. Your project sounds highly<br>
ambitious. It will need large amounts of work from a number of people. My<br>
experience is that volunteer labor, with no financial incentive, tends to be<br>
unreliable and sporadic.<br>
<p>
Have you given thought to making money from this operation, and to paying<br>
the people who work on it? If there is no start up funding, the best model<br>
may be an exaggeration of the Microsoft one. Microsoft actually pays below<br>
market salaries, but get the smartest programmers by giving generous stock<br>
options (which have produced many many millionaires on the Microsoft<br>
campus). For your project, you may be able to offer *no* pay yet still have<br>
strong incentives if there are stock options or similar, and if you have a<br>
plausible business plan.<br>
<p>
This may all sound like a damper. Many of us like to just get on with<br>
exploring our ideas without worrying about money matters. However, I<br>
strongly believe that financing deserves just as much attention as the ideas<br>
for building this virtual world. Otherwise, after an exciting beginning,<br>
it's liable to founder. If you organize a team to work on this, I urge you<br>
to include people with business skills.<br>
<p>
That said, I love the idea, and hope it can be organized so as to move ahead<br>
and keep moving. <br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
