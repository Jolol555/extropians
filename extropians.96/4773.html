<i>&gt; "Good luck on your test!"</i><br>
<i>&gt; "His company went public?  How fortunate!"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And so on.  I'm increasingly uncomfortable saying these things, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; have not come up with suitable replacements.  I'd love to have them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the same way that we have Newtonmas.</i><br>
<p>
Even though "luck" is often used a noun with a specific referent of<br>
a supernatural force that causes the dice to roll a certain way, I<br>
don't think a simple expression of "good luck" conveys that meaning.<br>
It's simply "may the dice roll in your favor."  I can see, though,<br>
where using it in this neutral sense might make it easier to slip<br>
into using it the wrong way ("I think I'll wear my lucky shirt.").<br>
Even in your sense above, where results of a school test should be<br>
only a product of study, there is still an element of randomness in<br>
things like which questions are chosen, events of the day that might<br>
distract you, etc., so a friendly "good luck" still seems reasonable.<br>
And anyone who thinks the stock market is deterministic...:)<br>
<p>
How about "Heisenberg be with you"?<br>
