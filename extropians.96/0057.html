From: James Daugherty &lt;jhdaugh@a-albionic.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;	This brings up a serious question.  Can a person with a scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind set ever have the "certainty" that seems to be required for peak</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance in many fields of endeavor?</i><br>
<p>
The honest scientist will not claim certainty about what is true, but<br>
I don't see anything that keeps him or her from having certainty about<br>
what to do next.  The two are not very tightly coupled.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I can't imagine what would make me dedicate a<br>
sizeable chunk of my life to be the fastest human to run 100M, when so<br>
many people with relatively little trouble have acquired an automobile<br>
that can go much faster for longer distances.  I wouldn't expect a<br>
person who finds such a boneheaded way to go 100M in a hurry to have<br>
anything resembling a scientific mind.<br>
