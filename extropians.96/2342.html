[Apologies to the Yank majority for noise, but I need the broadcast forum<br>
...]<br>
<p>
So far, Sarah Marr, Martin Traynor and Nicholas Bostrom have indicated they<br>
can get together Sunday afternoon, 3 Nov. in London.  I'll be out of pocket<br>
during the day today, 31 Oct. (CST), and will be in my office &lt;<br>
burchg@liddellsapp.com &gt; during the morning tomorrow, 1 Nov. (CST).  It looks<br>
like the best rendezvous TIME will be between 3 and 4 pm on Sunday.  I'll be<br>
free till whenever on Sunday night.<br>
<p>
We've yet to set a place.  As a failsafe in case we can't all connect to set<br>
an alternative more suitable as a rendezvous point, I'll be staying at:<br>
<p>
  The Caledonian Club<br>
  9 Halkin Street<br>
  London  SW1X 7DR<br>
  Phone:  171-235-5162<br>
  Fax:      171-235-4635<br>
<p>
This is in Belgravia between Sloane Street and Grosvenor Place (no jokes<br>
about Sloane Rangers, please).  I'll be at the club in the afternoon on<br>
Saturday, 2 Nov. so telephone contact Saturday afternoon might be a good way<br>
to get a firm meeting place set.  I may be in a jet-lag coma, but feel free<br>
to call.  I will be gone from there Saturday evening to see Guy Falkes<br>
fireworks, but don't yet know when I'll be leaving.<br>
<p>
One idea for a rendezvous point is a touristy pub called the Bag o' Nails (?)<br>
right across the street from the southwest corner of Buckingham Palace'<br>
grounds (near the Royal Mews) -- this would be preferable to my club, which<br>
has a silly "no-jeans" rule (among others) and, despite the Caledonian theme,<br>
the bar of which won't be open in the afternoon on Sunday ....<br>
<p>
Looking forward to seeing ya'll ...<br>
