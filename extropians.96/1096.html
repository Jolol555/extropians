  This topic may have been discussed before and I apologize if it has been.<br>
Normally, I would search the archives before raising a topic, but I am<br>
unable to do so currently - indeed that is the central point of this message.<br>
<p>
  I have been trying to read the extropian list by periodically examining<br>
the web archive. The web interface and storage capacity are potentially<br>
superior to my current e-mail capabilities.  There may be many people who<br>
wish to intermittently read the archive.  Unfortunately, the archive appears<br>
to be non-functional.  Several weeks ago the updating process stopped and<br>
now the archived messages have disappeared.<br>
<p>
  It is possible that the archives have been moved; however, no forwarding<br>
information has been provided at the location that has been used previously.<br>
Also, the pointer at the Extropy Institute web site still points to the<br>
non-functional archive site.<br>
<p>
  Perhaps a note could be placed at the archive indicating when it will<br>
become operational again - or if it will become operational.  Of course, it<br>
costs nothing to join the extropian list and I suspect the archive is a<br>
volunteer effort so this message is not intended to be hypercritical.<br>
<p>
  There is a core file at the location designated by the URL<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>. Perhaps some process died.<br>
<p>
  The web archive of the transhuman list also appears to have been<br>
discontinued months ago, unfortunately.<br>
<p>
  I am sending this note to the list, in part, because I am interested in<br>
whether or not others find the web archives valuable for reading the list.<br>
