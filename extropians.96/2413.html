<i>&gt;Until I get my neutron star computer, I plan to make small worlds.</i><br>
<p>
Hehe<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;True. But what I'm looking for is not technology, I want knowledge (and a </i><br>
<i>&gt;certain amount of wisdom). We cannot predict what is to be learned or </i><br>
<i>&gt;developed beforehand (otherwise we would know it already), but I bet it </i><br>
<i>&gt;will be interesting and beautiful!</i><br>
<p>
Agreed!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Using an atomic scale monitor is hi-fi overkill, you get a resolution </i><br>
<i>&gt;smaller than the wavelength of visible light)</i><br>
<p>
You'd never see the jaggies again! :) Hey try touching the text on the<br>
moniter!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;First, I would like to point out the work that has been done with</i><br>
<i>&gt;custom-designed proteins and artificial enzymes; thats what nanotech is</i><br>
<i>&gt;about, and the area shows great promise (and uses genengineering to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;there too). I read about (Science News a few years back) a change in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;bacterial protein that made it create small (20 atoms) crystals of</i><br>
<i>&gt;uranium.</i><br>
<p>
WOW! I never heard of that!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Secondly, I would like to point out that there is a qualitative difference</i><br>
<i>&gt;between the gears, wires and enzymes and the gene: we have reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;control over the former, but we cannot use the genes to do very complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;things. The cell is a nightmare of tangled interactions, where proteins</i><br>
<i>&gt;switch on and off genes producing other proteins that are marked by</i><br>
<i>&gt;enzymes becoming active making the cell do one thing and then switching on</i><br>
<i>&gt;another switch making the cell produce morphogens that influence the</i><br>
<i>&gt;neighbors to change their behavior... we can control a few genes we know</i><br>
<i>&gt;have rather direct effects (like eye color and trombine production), but</i><br>
<i>&gt;making cells differentiate and grow into something we want that isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;already coded somewhere is extremely nontrivial (i.e. nearly impossible)</i><br>
<i>&gt;at present. We can make crippled fruit flies, but not a fruit fly that</i><br>
<i>&gt;likes meat or have butterfly wings. </i><br>
<p>
Does this mean that today I can go get some gene therapy to make by brown<br>
eyes blue? Also, why not use multiple engineered bacterium to put together<br>
the first nanite for us?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The geep is more interesting, but wasn't it just a chimerical being (cells</i><br>
<i>&gt;of two types)? Anyway, it is just a combination and its creators didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;have any special new properties in mind when it was created - it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;something completely different to make (say) a goat with feathers. </i><br>
<p>
Know anywhere I can find pics of the geep?<br>
