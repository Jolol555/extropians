<p>
I've seen many projects which started out as Canadian research programs,<br>
ran out of funding, then came begging to one or more US Military depts<br>
to continue funding. These include the Avro Disk program, Dr. Gerald<br>
Bulls various gun projects (which culminated in Iraqs supergun), and a<br>
few others.<br>
<p>
Most of the "expatriate" Canadians referred to as working on the Apollo<br>
were actually former Germans who had worked on the V2 program during the<br>
war (or their students), as were most of our best rocket scientists, as<br>
well as the Russians best as well. So you could say that credit belongs<br>
to the Third Reich for having the foresight to fund rocket research to<br>
the extent they did. If you look at the source of the knowledge used and<br>
built on by the Nazis in rocketry, you will find that they got all their<br>
best ideas and advances from the patent papers of one man: Dr. Robert<br>
Goddard of Worcester Massachusetts. The peak funding he was ever able to<br>
muster here was a $50,000 grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, at the<br>
instigation of Charles Lindbergh. During the war, all the US military<br>
was interested in him for was creating and perfecting the bazooka<br>
weapon.<br>
