Max M:<br>
<i>&gt;What it means among other</i><br>
<i>&gt;things, is that the shape, function and disfunction of our bodies wil</i><br>
<i>&gt;allways have an impact on the way we see our self and the way we behave.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ask anybody with a physical handicap.</i><br>
<p>
I am so glad that you brought this up, Max.  I always prefer to focus <br>
on core issues, and the issue that underlies all gender research is <br>
the issue of difference.  (Warning:  Kathryn's Year-End Holiday <br>
Message revealed below)<br>
<p>
As humans, we have evolved into a vast spectrum of colors, shapes, <br>
beliefs, joys and suffering, each of it possessing its own special <br>
beauty.  Each of it possessing its own openings for further <br>
evolution.  Yet, all of these physical and cultural and sociological <br>
differences make up only about ten percent of our total sum as human <br>
beings.  <br>
<p>
We are much more alike than we are different, and yet we tend to <br>
focus almost exclusively on our differences, using them as means to <br>
rank each other into whatever power structures we have conjured up.<br>
Nowhere is this more evident that in the gender studies arena.  <br>
Entire academic careers have been founded on the proposition that <br>
women and men are hopelessly locked into an eternal struggle for <br>
conflicting goals.<br>
<p>
We can do better than this!  We have to do better than this, or we <br>
will never reach higher levels of relating to each other.  <br>
<p>
My Axioms of Difference:  (i) We are persons first, then humans.  <br>
(ii) When we as humans learn to accept the basic commonality of every <br>
person, only then will we be able to truly appreciate and celebrate those <br>
differences that make each of us unique.<br>
<p>
This to me represents one of the personal challenges of transhumanism, <br>
because all the technology in the world will not do this work.  It is <br>
essential preparation for a change in state to whatever form we take <br>
next.  I accepted this challenge seven years ago, and it has formed <br>
the basis for my life's study and work.  I welcome anyone who cares to <br>
walk with me on this path, if only for a mile or two--it's always nice to <br>
have company!<br>
<p>
I hope that everyone has a restful and peaceful holiday break.<br>
<p>
