<i>&gt;Again it's a question about exponential growth. If the doubling rate</i><br>
<i>&gt;becomes to fast, it will be very easy to end up several generations behind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we are close to a Singularity it would be very easy to be left a LOT of</i><br>
<i>&gt;generations behind. The more likely it will be that a techno elite will</i><br>
<i>&gt;develop. </i><br>
<p>
I agree with general principles of what you are saying.  The exponential<br>
growth of IT has left *a lot* of people in the dust and is making it<br>
increasingly difficult to keep current.  I see the ranks of the techno elite<br>
becoming increasingly small.  I am lucky in that I started over ten years<br>
ago *AND* I spend significant amounts of time and resources learning new<br>
technologies.  It has already become a full-time job just staying current.<br>
I believe it is now impossible for anyone just starting out to achieve my<br>
level of computer expertise.  Technology is changing so fast that it is<br>
coming into conflict with the human ability to learn.  It is very quickly<br>
coming up on the point where technology will be expanding at a rate that is<br>
*impossible* for humans to keep current on it.  It dismays me to find that<br>
many of my friends who used to be among the techno elite have fallen along<br>
the wayside because they could not keep up with the pace of change.  The<br>
only solution for many people these days is to specialize in specific<br>
technologies.  The number of "broad spectrum" techno elites is dwindling<br>
rapidly, but the remaining few tend to be exceptionally intelligent<br>
individuals.  <br>
<p>
I fear the day when I too may be forced to become one of the techno<br>
obsolete.  It would force me to accept limits I refuse to impose on myself.<br>
