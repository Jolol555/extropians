I don't think I understand your comments here.  But rather than get<br>
distracted with this, let me rephrase my position on the main point.<br>
<p>
Dan claims that any agent faced with the choice between sending out<br>
probes to colonize the universe and staying home and using the probe<br>
mass to compute stuff, would rather stay home.  The idea is that there<br>
is no information that could be returned from the colonized universe<br>
that couldn't be more quickly computed by that probe mass staying<br>
home.   This seems a remarkable claim to me.<br>

<p>
Of course it is precedented.  That is exactly what research feeding back<br>
into education is.  As humanity learns more, we get better at learning<br>
more, and our understanding expands.  It just doesn't explode as fast<br>
as you think possible. <br>
 <br>

<i>&gt;entire spectrum, from moron to Einstein. Assuming, everybody is an </i><br>
<i>&gt;Einstein equivalent? Surely, this must have some impact upon the world?</i><br>
<p>
Of course it will.  And human IQ *does* seem to be have increasing for<br>
the last century.  Hal posted on this a few months (or was it a year) ago.<br>
