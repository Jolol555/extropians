This doesn't appear possible at all, since we know quite well how the EEG<br>
activity of dying and dead people look, and it dosn't speed up like it<br>
would have to in this scenario. I think even those time-affecting drugs<br>
(anybody have some information about reliable subjective-time influencing<br>
effects?) doesn't change the speed of neural signals much, although<br>
noradrenaline increases the firing frequency slightly. <br>

Yes, this is one of the more bizarre consequences of the MWI. Of course, <br>
you could have been born in a cul de sac in reality, where *all* <br>
physically realizable timelines end in death, but I find this unlikely <br>
(after all, from a QM perspective it is quite possible that you would <br>
randomly be teleported away from Earth just as the sun went nova or <br>
something similar, and that would be enough to guarantee your survival in <br>
your worldline). <br>
