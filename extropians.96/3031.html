<i>&gt;Well i think the weather is to imprecise for us to controll. It's to big a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism. It's a bit like curing cancer with chemo therapy. overall you</i><br>
<i>&gt;maybe can make things work but you kill of a lot of healthy cells in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;process. That can be a bit of a problem when the weather is the cancer and</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans are the healthy cells. It would be a PR nightmare at least.</i><br>
<p>
Read the Nanotechnology: Flawed by Design thread in the Hotwired Brain<br>
Tennis section. It deals primarily about how some people think you need to<br>
have technologies that evolve into the environment and how some people<br>
think you can accomplish the same thing using centrally-designed<br>
technologies. I tend to agree with the latter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And what about the ice age. Recent findings from the inlandic ice on</i><br>
<i>&gt;Greenland shows that a new ice age can pop up within as little as 20 years.</i><br>
<p>
Speaking of ice ages, I read somewhere that theres a theory based on the<br>
fact that we may be preventing the next ice age due to global warming.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Instead of changing the enviroment as we do now when we look at the small</i><br>
<i>&gt;scale, wouldn't it be better to adapt to it. If we can imagine building big</i><br>
<i>&gt;O'Neill type space stations in orbit, and the colonialisation of Mars,</i><br>
<i>&gt;couldn't we imagine doing similar things here on earth. (there's still a</i><br>
<i>&gt;lot of parcels available in Sahara ;-) )</i><br>
<p>
This sounds sorta sick but couldn't you terraform deserts by dumping tons<br>
of raw sewage out there and have it cover the desert for miles and create a<br>
thick layer of topsoil?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;HAARP is going to be the Area 51 of the 21st century.  It will have all</i><br>
<i>&gt;sorts of things ascribed to it, a few of which will be true, the rest</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be pure bogosity.</i><br>
<p>
Ahhh!! Do *NOT EVEN* relate HAARP to the UFO fanatic's dream site. The<br>
HAARP concept is feasible! Popular Science went over the issue of HAARP.<br>
They also went over Area 51 but meantioned it as a secret site for<br>
experimental aircraft technologies rather than tabloidy UFO shit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For better or worse, I don't think climate or weather manipulation is</i><br>
<i>&gt;going to be possible for quite some time.  In particular, I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt;HAARP has anything to do with weather control.  Crackpots all over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;net have been accusing this project of being about everything from mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;control to UFO communications.  I won't rule out the possibility that there</i><br>
<i>&gt;is more to the project than is public knowledge, but there is so much</i><br>
<i>&gt;garbage about HAARP out there that I view any claims about it on the net</i><br>
<i>&gt;with major skepticism.</i><br>
<p>
Popular Science meantioned that eventually with a few breakthoughs it may<br>
be possible to alter climate with HAARP-style technologies. HAARP as it<br>
currently stands can't alter shit.<br>
