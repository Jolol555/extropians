Is there a silence?  Consider a few races, all of which transcended into<br>
massminds (ick.)  They communicate by focused beams, none of which<br>
intercept us.  These beams are also highly compressed and possibly<br>
encrypted, so any interception detects random noise.  Conversely they<br>
broadcast, but it appears random.  No megaengineering because it's not<br>
practically worth it yet, no visits because they just haven't.<br>

Agreed.  Except that a mind ecology might be trapped in one big solid<br>
state processor, with access to the material world controlled by an<br>
isolationist dictator.  As usual, we can't have more than a few of these.<br>

The first race to evolve within a billion light years might have a<br>
highly conservationist culture.  All younger races are either eliminated<br>
or not allowed off their homeworlds.  I can imagine an ancient race<br>
which has a few Dyson cities per galaxy, which we haven't found yet, and<br>
a bunch of planetary zoos, perhaps surrounded by some megashield to<br>
block radio transmissions (so as not to let newbies like us know someone<br>
else is out there.)  Or the zoos use neutrinos to communicate with each<br>
other, or masers.  So the conservators maximize the diversity they can<br>
observe and draw from.  They need strong social control, but perhaps<br>
they're all mentally descended from one source.  Or we might see some<br>
odd astronomical explosion someday which is actually a police action. :)<br>
