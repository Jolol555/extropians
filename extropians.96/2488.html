<i>&gt;&gt;  Just like a stream of consciousness ceases when I go to sleep</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and a separate stream of consciousness is created when my body</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wakes up?</i><br>
<p>
Ahhh! I'm a clone! Must stay awake! Break out the amphetamines! :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, I beleive that an individual who takes an extended</i><br>
<i>&gt;period of time adding better, faster higher powered artificial</i><br>
<i>&gt;augmentation to the existing mind would, once a certain threshold had</i><br>
<i>&gt;been reached, have very little awareness of a difference of self if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;original bioware suddenly crashed.</i><br>
<p>
I agree! A fellow gradual incremental uploader!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also suspect that any clones would also feel a distinct pretectiveness</i><br>
<i>&gt;of self, something that is ingrained.</i><br>
<p>
Ever see the star trek where I believe the transporter malfunctions? And<br>
there is a clone of Kirk and they kill the clone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not to mention greater sensory bandwidth and a lack of need to lug a</i><br>
<i>&gt;heavy body around the world or solar system to take on a new project.</i><br>
<p>
Hell, build your own body or 'avatar' as it is called. You could be<br>
anything you want as well as build your house, world, solar system all<br>
without physical materials. You'd probably have to pay for living space in<br>
the form of terabytes.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would surmise that the closest we can ever actually get to teleportation</i><br>
<i>&gt;is to beam one's software template out to operate a cyborg at a distant</i><br>
<i>&gt;location. Given transciever stations on different planets, and the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that photons do not know what elapsed time is, we could have</i><br>
<i>&gt;instantaneous interplanetary and interstellar travel by beaming our</i><br>
<i>&gt;'wareness out to another planet, and loaded into an android or</i><br>
<i>&gt;gengineered organism capable of being implanted. Scotty, you're a has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been!</i><br>
<p>
Or you could use a slower form of nano where you shoot our nanites carrying<br>
your cells which reconstruct you at the destination. They could pack you<br>
into a dense reentry shell and when just about to impact, reorganize you<br>
into yourself. I always did wonder in Star Trek how they reconstructed the<br>
away team on the planet's surface! Hell maybe we're seeing millions of<br>
clones of Deanna Troy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;just this is ample justification to get to work now on really pushing</i><br>
<i>&gt;interstellar probes, to get recieving stations on site by the time we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are ready to use them to farcast.</i><br>
<p>
Upload me to Voyager 3!<br>
