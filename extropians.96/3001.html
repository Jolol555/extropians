A related note (not specific to David Musick or John Clark)...<br>
<p>
I joined this list hoping it would prove an island of enlightenment.  I<br>
don't mean a place where everyone agrees with *me* -- I mean a place where<br>
people are committed to progress and willing to thoroughly test out new<br>
ideas.  That requires beating the !#%! out of ideas without getting<br>
personally bent out of shape.<br>
<p>
Hey, if you can make my ideas look foolish because you have more/better<br>
information or have attained a higher level of intellectual development, go<br>
right ahead.  You are helping me.  While I prefer you dispense a little<br>
encouragement to me as you tear my pet theories to shreds, doing so is<br>
purely optional.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, in the short time I have been here I have witnessed at least<br>
three incidents in which people have stormed out of debates saying "If<br>
that's the only way you can discuss this, let's not discuss it at all!"<br>
<p>
Yes, ad hominem arguments prove nothing.  They deserve to be exposed and<br>
dispensed with.  So just do it.  But truly enlightened thinkers are not so<br>
easily wounded.<br>
<p>
Upward!, Outward!...<br>
<p>
...And get over it already, OK?<br>
