snip: Michael Wiik<br>
<i>&gt;Doesn't most real estate property derive (at some point in the past) from</i><br>
a coercive takeover of the land? If the King of France bequeaths to some<br>
nobleman some land (which the King obtained &amp; maintained by coercion), does<br>
the nobleman's descendents hundreds of years down the line have a real<br>
right to the property? I asked this a couple of years ago, but never got<br>
what I considered a satisfactory response.<br>
<p>
... and chances are that you won't. Unless it is of the type Twirlip of<br>
Greymist gave, which states that is sucks and is undesirable, but<br>
 neccessary.  Or the type that Sarash Naidu states, that it sucks and must be<br>
abolished. There is a huge grey area in this question that goes way beyond<br>
the field of economics (ethics; individual  epistomology).  I ask these kinds<br>
of questions too, and most often get ignored, ostensibly because of my aol<br>
address, or I am not academically up to par, but perhaps more truthfully<br>
because  there aren't any *simple* answers...<br>

PS. If I had the complex answers... ie: if i could start arguing for  one<br>
side (leftist anarchist or laissez-faire) perhaps I could join the debate,<br>
and join the endless feed back loop -and have the dubious privelidge of being<br>
"right."<br>
