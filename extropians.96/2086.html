<i>&gt;   Is anyone familiar with experimentation attempting to combine sensory</i><br>
<i>&gt;deprivation with other techniques (???) in order to give a feeling for what</i><br>
<i>&gt;the upload experience might be like? Would seem to be reasonable, so I </i><br>
<i>&gt;assume something like this has been tried. Perhaps such a setup might help</i><br>
<i>&gt;overcome some common fears and misconceptions about uploading.</i><br>
<p>
Sensory deprivation?!?! I think a incremental upload would feel like a box<br>
implanted in my back w/a plug for a network connection and tendrils of an<br>
uploading organism slowly work through my brain replacing neurons with<br>
itself and rebuilding the neuron structure in a virtual world with all<br>
connections same as before all during a period of a few months and i<br>
wouldn't feel any different until my entire brain was uploaded and i made<br>
the decision to flip off old sensory equipment and stick inside the virtual<br>
world perminently although i could still control my old body remotely or by<br>
uploading myself to the surgically implanted box in my back. The neuron<br>
connections in the virtual world would need to be slowed down for the<br>
brain's timing but can accelerate to any desired rate once completely<br>
uploaded. I believe that a gradual incremental upload will be required so<br>
you can 'grow' into the computer rather than merely having the original<br>
person die and a duplicate reproduced inside the virtual world as would be<br>
with a quickie nano upload. The brain is not a static object and thus cannot<br>
be uploaded as if it were.<br>
