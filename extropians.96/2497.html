        By Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
        In reaction to medical cannabis access referendums on <br>
        the ballots in Arizona and California, former presidents <br>
        Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George Bush signed a let-<br>
        ter stating that they ``categorically oppose'' access to <br>
        cannabis for its many proven therapeutic uses such as the<br>
        prevention of blindness and epileptic seizures [1].<br>
<p>
        Their chief concern was that legal medical access would <br>
        send the message that cannabis is safe.  The presidents <br>
        can, however, lay their safety concerns to rest because <br>
        the scientific literature overwhelmingly confirms that <br>
        cannabis is both an effective and safe medicine.<br>
<p>
<p>
        The Cannabis Safety Profile <br>
<p>
        The journal PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEWS [2] reports that<br>
        decades of research prove that, "Compared with legal<br>
        drugs...marijuana does not pose greater risks."  Yet<br>
        based upon mortality statistics,  we can safely con-<br>
        clude that cannabis is one of the safest medical drugs<br>
        known, for, while prescription drugs, defined as safe<br>
        by the FDA, kill up to 27,000 and aspirin up to 1,000 <br>
        Americans per year, cannabis kills 0 per year [3].<br>
<p>
        When we know the facts we can understand why in 1988, <br>
        after extensive review of the scientific literature, <br>
        the DEA's own administrative judge Frances Young con-<br>
        cluded that ``Marijuana is one of the safest thera-<br>
        peutically active substances know to man.'' [4]<br>
<p>
        Opponents of legal cannabis access would have us be-<br>
        lieve that there is not enough research available to<br>
        determine its safety.  Nothing could be further from <br>
        the truth. Cannabis is one of the most thoroughly re-<br>
        searched drugs in history, and the evidence gathered <br>
        over the centuries clearly proves that it is safe:<br>
<p>
        * The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report (1894): an<br>
        exhaustive seven-volume, 3,281-page report that con-<br>
        cludes: "Moderate [cannabis] use produces practically <br>
        no ill effects." [5][6][7]<br>
<p>
        * The Panama Canal Military Study (1916-1929), amass-<br>
        ing extensive data on the health impact of cannabis<br>
        smoking upon  American soldiers stationed in Panama,<br>
        recommended that "No steps be taken by the Canal Zone <br>
        authorities to prevent the sale or use of Marihuana." <br>
        The research also concluded that, "There is no evi-<br>
        dence that Marihuana...is...'habit-forming.'" [7][8]<br>
<p>
        * The LaGuardia Report (1939-1944), commissioned by<br>
        New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, which includ-<br>
        ed evidence gathered over thousands of years,  con-<br>
        cluded that "Smoking marihuana does not lead to add-<br>
        iction... does not lead to morphine, heroin, or co-<br>
        caine addiction"  and that  "the publicity concern-<br>
        ing the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking<br>
        in New York City is unfounded." [7][9]<br>
<p>
        * The Baroness Wootton Report (1968), commissioned <br>
        by the Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence of the <br>
        United Kingdom Home Office, concluded, "There is no <br>
        evidence that...serious physical dangers are directly <br>
        associated with the smoking of cannabis." The report <br>
        also noted that "Cannabis use does not lead to heroin <br>
        addiction" and that  "there is no evidence that [can-<br>
        nabis]...is producing in otherwise normal people con-<br>
        ditions of dependence or psychosis, requiring medical<br>
        treatment." [7][10] <br>
<p>
        The HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH LETTER [11]<br>
        reports the findings of other major cannabis studies:<br>
<p>
             In three major studies conducted in Jamaica, <br>
             Costa Rica, and Greece, researchers have<br>
             compared heavy long-term cannabis users <br>
             with non-users and found no evidence of <br>
             intellectual or neurological damage, no <br>
             changes in personality,  and no loss of <br>
             the will to work or participate in society. <br>
<p>
        The Jamaican study states that,  even as cannabis use<br>
        in Jamaica "is pervasive" and is used "in heavier quan-<br>
        tities with greater THC potency than in the U.S.," its <br>
        use is "without deleterious social or psychological <br>
        consequences." [12]<br>
<p>
        What's more, the three studies cited, the largest human<br>
        cannabis studies to date, also revealed that heavy long-<br>
        term cannabis users scored slightly higher on IQ tests, <br>
        had slightly lower rates of illness and cancer, and liv-<br>
        ed longer on average than non-users. Users also proved <br>
        to be more relaxed and sociable than non-users [4][12]<br>
        [13]. The best evidence indicates, contrary to GovtMedia <br>
        disinformation, that cannabis is safe and good for you.<br>
<p>
        In line with the findings of the Panama Canal study<br>
        and the LaGuardia Report,  current research confirms<br>
        that the addictive potential of cannabis is very low.<br>
        The journal TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES states <br>
        that research shows cannabis has  "limited potential <br>
        for development of...psychological dependence due to <br>
        the weak reinforcing properties of Delta-9-THC." [14] <br>
        BRAIN RESEARCH journal observes that "cannabinoid <br>
        dependence and withdrawal phenomena are minimal." [15] <br>
<p>
        Research proves that cannabis is nontoxic. For example,<br>
        in the journal FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED TOXICOLOGY [16], <br>
        Dr. William Slikker, director of the Neurotoxicology  <br>
        Division of the National Center for Toxicological Re-<br>
        search (NCTR), described the health of monkeys exposed <br>
        to very high levels of cannabis for an extended period:<br>
<p>
             The general health of the monkeys was not <br>
             compromised by a year of marijuana exposure  <br>
             as indicated by weight gain, carboxyhemoglobin <br>
             and clinical chemistry/hematology values.<br>
<p>
        When THE ARKANSAS TIMES [17] asked Dr. Merle Paule of <br>
        NCTR about evidence of cannabis toxicity and the health <br>
        of the monkeys in the study, Dr. Paule said, "There's <br>
        just nothing there. They were all fine."<br>
<p>
        The journal TOXICOLOGY LETTERS [18] published a study <br>
        that found no link between cannabis smoking and lung <br>
        cancer. The seven researchers in the study concluded:<br>
<p>
             It has been suggested that marijuana smoking <br>
             is a proximal cause of respiratory cancer. <br>
             However, these intimations have not been <br>
             borne out by epidemiological investigation.<br>
<p>
        Not only is the evidence linking cannabis smoking to <br>
        cancer negative, but the largest human studies cited in-<br>
        dicated that cannabis users had lower rates of cancer<br>
        than nonusers. What's more, those who smoked both can-<br>
        nabis and tobacco had lower rates of lung cancer than <br>
        those who smoked only tobacco -- a strong indication<br>
        of chemo-prevention [4][12][13]. Even more, in 1975 re-<br>
        searchers at the Medical College of Virginia found that <br>
        cannabis showed powerful antitumor activity against <br>
        both benign and malignant tumors (the government then <br>
        banned all future cannabis/cancer research) [4].  In<br>
        fact,  the NEW ENGLISH DISPENSATORY of 1764 recommends<br>
        boiled cannabis roots for the elimination of tumors [19].<br>
        Powerful evidence that cannabis not only does not cause<br>
        cancer, but that it may prevent and even cure cancer.<br>
<p>
        The few studies that the GovtMedia drums into the pub-<br>
        lic mind over and over,  which claim to show that can-<br>
        nabis is a harmful drug, are almost all the work of the<br>
        the government's top hired gun, Dr. Gabriel Nahas. The<br>
        NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE described Nahas's work<br>
        as "psychopharmacological McCarthyism that compels him <br>
        to use half-truths, innuendo and unverified assertions." <br>
        The JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION also con-<br>
        demned his work, stating, "Examples of biased selection<br>
        and...omissions of facts abound in every chapter." [20]<br>
<p>
        Conclusion:<br>
<p>
        Not only does the best scientific research overwhelming-<br>
        ly confirm that cannabis is both an effective medicine <br>
        and a safe drug, but that it may be both chemo-preven-<br>
        tive and therapeutic and generally beneficial to health. <br>
        What this shows us most clearly, in light of the consen-<br>
        sus to the contrary, is the enormous power of a Big Lie. <br>
<p>
        With its vast resources, the "GovtMedia elite" are <br>
        able to fabricate and fob off a pharmacological fraud <br>
        against both cannabis and the public interest. Through <br>
        sheer repetition and consistent suppression of contrary <br>
        information, they are able to construct an edifice of <br>
        public consensus which even the hardest scientific <br>
        facts fail to topple.<br>
<p>
        The truth is no stronger than the ability of true in-<br>
        formation to surpass the public distribution of false <br>
        and misleading information. The GovtMedia has a greater <br>
        ability to distribute a Big Lie than any other sector <br>
        of society has to distribute the truth. However, this <br>
        report right here contains copious quantities of care-<br>
        fully referenced scientific facts that consistently <br>
        and conclusively confirm that cannabis is safe --<br>
        thereby exploding the GovtMedia's Big Lie. <br>
<p>
        As truth is only as powerful as it is known, do all <br>
        that is in your power to make these powerful facts <br>
        known, that we might put an end to the destructive <br>
        and illogical prohibition of the proven safe and ef-<br>
        fective drug cannabis,  for possession of which 10 <br>
        million Americans have been arrested since 1965 [21].<br>
