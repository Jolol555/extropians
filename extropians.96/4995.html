  It sure is unpleasant when somebody replaces your point with something<br>
entirely different.   However, I didn't do it.  At no point I was saying<br>
that I<br>
wanted to control all decisions for everybody, or any decisions for anybody<br>
without their consent.   The "original connotations"  were that if everybody<br>
would have incentives to figure our for themselves where they are competent<br>
enough to improve the existing solutions, and be prepared to be accountable<br>
for their mistakes.<br>
<p>
  Still, to answer your question:  there was no time in my life where I didn't<br>
have to obey the decisions made by people who had no interest in my opinion,<br>
and there was no moment in my life when I didn't hate it.  Many of these<br>
decisions have brought a lot of grief to me and people who were making them.<br>
Surprisingly enough, the very position in the decision-making bodies that<br>
allowed<br>
those people to cause lots of damage, made their personal lives better than<br>
those of the people they harmed.  Negative accountability?  When it stops,<br>
things may improve.  That's what I meant.<br>
