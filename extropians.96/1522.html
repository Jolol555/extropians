A good point. Nonetheless, I find myself far more intolerant of people who<br>
issue no-knock warrants to armed SWAT teams than I do of the lazy, sloppy,<br>
shiftless, foul-mouthed, anti-authoritarian "follower" pot-smokers they<br>
are sent to bust. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since toleration of entropy is ruination, </i><br>
<p>
I am uncomfortable with the broad sweep of your generalization. I would<br>
say that toleration of nonconsensual violence and expropriation is<br>
ruination. I think that in this case if one wishes to be accurate one must<br>
be specific. What I like about extropy is that it presents a positive<br>
ideal, something to work toward. If I want a negative ideal to be opposed,<br>
there is a long rich liberal tradition of staunch opposition to the use of<br>
force and fraud which can be traced continuously back to the Whigs in the<br>
English Civil War and further. This tradition, which most of the people I<br>
know have been steeped in from birth, is also closely associated with a<br>
tradition of toleration of new ideas and even new values. The name of this<br>
tradition has been stolen and perverted by constructivist-rationalist<br>
politicians of the socialist variety, but we've renamed the tradition and<br>
we're moving on. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Fighting the servile society is like a pre-emptive strike, </i><br>
<p>
We are long past the time for pre-emptive strikes, Reilly. As our<br>
political opponents like to keep pointing out, the libertarian utopia has<br>
never been achieved: yet. There is plenty of active evil in the world that<br>
wants direct opposition, and I would feel that I was wasting my time if I<br>
tried to combat it by morally reforming my neighbors. I find that I can be<br>
far more effective finding and collaborating with those who are in no<br>
great need of moral improvement. I have yet to find any shortage of such<br>
people. <br>
<p>
I am not much interested in changing other people's values, except to the<br>
extent that they endorse the use of violent means in some attempt to<br>
change mine. I figure that if I try to push a whole bag of values on them,<br>
and not just the cardinal but subtle point of noninitiation of force, I'm<br>
only going to be triggering every memetic immune system within a hundred<br>
yards.  Ordinarily, I don't argue on behalf of toleration, and in fact,<br>
I've put in some cautionary words (favoring what is usually referred to as<br>
"critical thinking") on the transhuman list a few months ago when the<br>
paeans to toleration were getting a little thick. But when I see you<br>
eagerly whipping up an orgy of rigidity, intolerance, internal censorship<br>
of thought, and various other things which are Not To My Taste, I'm going<br>
to speak against it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Many thinkers have noted the coupling of servility and authoritarian violence.</i><br>
<p>
I get a funny feeling participating in this discussion. Is there anyone on<br>
this list who could reasonably be accused of being servile? Thought not.<br>
Why are we discussing this? Reilly, if you want to crush the servility<br>
meme, you are preaching to the choir here. I'm with Hagbard Celine: "Non <br>
serviam, baby."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here lies real trouble with governmental minimalism.  The only way that minimal</i><br>
<i>&gt; government can work, is when individuals govern themselves.  But individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot govern themselves without learning to obey themselves, that is, to place</i><br>
<i>&gt; their animal desires for vacant freedom under the sovereignty of their rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind which understands the nature of the limitations external reality places on</i><br>
<i>&gt; us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And individuals can never learn to obey themselves - that is, develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-control - unless they have learned to obey someone above them.</i><br>
<p>
I vigorously disagree. People learn to govern themselves by being expected<br>
to govern themselves, preferably by their parents, from earliest<br>
childhood. A minimal government which offers nothing in the way of<br>
religious or moral guidance to the people it governs is crucial for the<br>
development of a society in which the expectation of self-governance is<br>
routine. The most disturbing recent cultural trend I can think of is that<br>
the American people are widely expecting to receive moral guidance in<br>
their lives from such scum as Bill Dole and Bob Clinton. <br>
<p>
Interestingly, I think this is the first point in my conversations with <br>
you in which Nietzsche takes your side of the question and not mine. <br>
Though it is hard to tell for sure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; this point now, when 40% of GDP goes to government.  For the ideal of minimum</i><br>
<i>&gt; government to work, you must have maximum self-government, and this you can only</i><br>
<i>&gt; have with legitimate hierarchical levels of authority.  </i><br>
<p>
We disagree about the sorts of cultural conditions that produce <br>
self-governing individuals. I say people who are consistently expected to <br>
govern themselves learn how to do so and usually do a pretty good job. <br>
People who are consistently expected to submit to authority can never <br>
learn how to govern themselves except through luck and canniness. Or they <br>
let themselves be governed by a moral code which has been drummed into <br>
their head from birth, a code which will probably require changes with <br>
the times, which the non-self-governing person with the robot policeman <br>
in his or her head will not know how to do. <br>
<p>
For me, self-government means self-government, not government by one of <br>
my subroutines (which might or might not be labeled "superego"). It's a <br>
skill, and a difficult one which I do not pretend to have mastered. <br>
Working on this skill seems difficult enough to me that this task alone <br>
might be enough to make eternal life meaningful for and delightful to me. <br>
Fortunately, plenty of other tasks call as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But that was thirty years ago.  For the last five years, the operating principle</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the public schools has been that no one will be more educated than the least</i><br>
<i>&gt; educated.</i><br>
<p>
This is one reason why I'm more concerned about getting the government out<br>
of the education business than I am about changing the lifestyles of my<br>
hippie neighbors. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Molnar goes on to explain:  "Authority does not become irrational by the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that *will* is one of its essential components, nor does it become tyrannical by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fact that it is an articulator and preserver of inequality.  If a society,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with its rich articulation, is reduced to an undifferentiated mass, it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority it will face, but the most oppressive despotism.  Those who exercise</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority must, therefore, have the courage and the will to lift - and keep -</i><br>
<i>&gt; society above the temptations of the anthill."  And those who don't exercise</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority, must be individually intolerant of authoritarian violence.  They also</i><br>
<i>&gt; can go a long way towards preventing authoritarian violence from arising, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; being intolerant of servility - of the wave-bobbers - calling them to turn</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards extropy, and setting a living example of the fruits of such a turn.</i><br>
<p>
This might be all well and good in other times, Reilly. I generally agree<br>
with what you say and quote here. But we are not talking about "preventing<br>
authoritarian violence from arising". The world is full of authoritarian<br>
violence, and the last really big wave of it only ended some fifty years<br>
ago. Currently, more than 50% of the product of the US economy is being<br>
poured down a rathole. You know what a tiny sliver of that money, left to<br>
be spent consensually by individuals to further their own values, could do<br>
for life-extension and space-industrialization research.  This is violence<br>
on a grand scale. This is not a game of preventive measures. <br>
<p>
So, um, Harry Browne in '96.  ;)<br>
