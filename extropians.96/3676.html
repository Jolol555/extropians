<i>&gt; ...e.g. I find this argument utterly bizarre.  Whether 21st century</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanity dies out or goes on to Omega, to reach the 21st century someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; had to live in the 20th.  That happens to be us.  If someone else lived</i><br>
<i>&gt; now, "we" wouldn't live later on; "we" are those who live here and now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who have grown up in this century.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; When contemplating any future with a history, given that the future will</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen the probability of the history having happened is 1.</i><br>
<p>
I had much the same reaction, but the book discusses this idea at length<br>
and tries to answer it.<br>
<p>
The key point is whether it is justified to consider ourselves as having<br>
been randomly chosen from all points in human history.  As you say,<br>
to some extent this seems unreasonable since there is only one Twirlip<br>
of Greymist and he always exists/existed/will exist in this era.<br>
<p>
However, in other contexts we do accept reasoning where we consider<br>
ourselves randomly chosen.  For example, suppose you knew that one<br>
particular blood type predominated in the U.S. but didn't know what<br>
it was.  You later learned that your blood type is O positive.  From this<br>
you might conclude that there was a better chance that the common blood<br>
type is O positive than other possibilities.<br>
<p>
Or, suppose you learned that 90% of people have a certain pattern of<br>
creases on their palm.  Without looking at your own hand, you would be<br>
inclined to suspect that you would also have this same pattern.<br>
<p>
In each of these cases, you could argue the other way, that _someone_<br>
is among the people who don't have the creases, or who have more rare<br>
blood types.  That might happen to be you.  But the probability argument<br>
is still valid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So what about the 19th century?  Or the 5th B.C.?  Someone lived through</i><br>
<i>&gt; those moments.  Should Babbage have commented on how unlikely it was for</i><br>
<i>&gt; him to have existed?</i><br>
<p>
The existence of people in low-probability circumstances does not<br>
invalidate the probabilistic reasoning, any more than the fact that your<br>
friend Joe has AB negative blood falsifies the notion that O positive is<br>
more common.  (I should note that I am being hypothetical here, I don't<br>
actually know much about blood types.)<br>
<p>
Suppose you were told that human history could be divided into two eras,<br>
with 99.99999+% of all humans born in era 1 and the remainder born in<br>
era 2.  Given this information, which era would you expect to be born in?<br>
Now suppose you are told that there is another possible timeline, one<br>
where 60% were born in era 1 and 40% in era 2.  You actually don't know<br>
which timeline reflects your world.<br>
<p>
Now you find out that you were born in era 2.  Doesn't this give you<br>
reason to strongly reject the hypothesis that you live in the first<br>
world, and to believe that you live in the second?<br>
<p>
The first world corresponds to one in which life expands to fill the<br>
galaxy, with the population increasing by factors of billions or more.<br>
The second corresponds to one where the total number of humans who ever<br>
live is not much more than those who have lived already.  This is the<br>
doomsday reasoning which concludes that the human race will soon die<br>
out.<br>
