I don't think that's what John said, and it's not what I said. Free markets<br>
may not choose the *best* result, but they do choose results that are better<br>
than will be chosen by any other known system. Furthermore, I don't see any<br>
way of determining what a good result is other than through the free choices<br>
of individuals contracting with one another.<br>
<p>
Since you are not proposing centralized control, what exactly are you<br>
proposing as an alternative? Things like better informed and more rational<br>
consumers and producers certainly would make the market work better, but<br>
that is not an *alternative* to spontaneous order/free markets.<br>
