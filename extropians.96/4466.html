I'm not sure exactly, but its supposedly involves either diving into the<br>
black hole (you never actually hit it, apparently) or skipping across<br>
its event horizon.<br>

His latest stuff has pretty much left most physicists agog and<br>
incredulous anyways, so I wouldnt claim anything more than cursory<br>
knowledge anyways.<br>

True. I did read about utilizing a type of fullerene type carbon sleeve,<br>
where the whole sleeve is one interconnected molecule, in the<br>
containment of this structure. I don't know who said that it had to<br>
rotate near light speed, as that would not be necessary. You only need<br>
it spinning fast enough for centrifugal forces countering the<br>
neutroniums own gravity gradent beyond a few cm to maintain the tubular<br>
structure, thus allowing ships to traverse the hole. The neutronium's<br>
gravity gradient is neccessary to neutralize the gravity gradient of the<br>
wormhole, so the ships don't get torn apart by tidal forces.<br>
