                    HEAD FOR THE HILLS: <br>
<p>
                  BIG BROTHER SOON TO HAVE <br>
<p>
                  X - R A Y   V I S I O N<br>

<p>
Joyce Price of The Washington Times (A1, 8/13/96) reports that<br>
the government will soon have a new weapon in its war on liberty<br>
-- a camera that can see through clothes to reveal all the <br>
private goodies concealed therein. <br>
<p>
Someday soon there will be no place to run, no place to hide, <br>
no place outside the all-seeing eye of the State. It's going <br>
to be so safe and wonderful then -- NOT !<br>
<p>
Ms. Price writes in the Times:<br>
<p>
        "A new weapon against terrorism works like <br>
        Superman's eyes: It looks right through you. <br>
        The high-tech camera, know as the passive <br>
        millimeter wave imager, boasts the equivalent <br>
        of X-ray vision, which allows it to penetrate <br>
        clothing to 'see' a concealed weapon, plastic <br>
        explosives, or drugs."<br>
<p>
The "Millivison" camera is not an X-ray machine. An X-ray <br>
machine creates an X-ray image by sending X-rays through a <br>
person's body. This device on the other hand is passive, it <br>
merely receives and reads the natural radiations from your <br>
body; radiations that are in "a different part of the <br>
spectrum" than X-rays. <br>
<p>
Sufficiently solid items, such as a gun, a bag of crack or <br>
candy, block these radiations revealing the silhouetted shape <br>
of that item to the camera's, and in turn to the govt's, eye. <br>
<p>
The 'National Institute of Justice' funded the research and <br>
development of this new tool for tyranny under the pretext <br>
of stopping terrorism. The new wave of terrorism that has <br>
hit the U.S. is doing wonders for the growth of govt power, <br>
just as the Reichstag fire did wonders for the Nazis.<br>

<p>
The ACLU, NRA, and the National Association of Criminal <br>
Defense Lawyers are not happy about the new device. Jack <br>
King, spokesperson for the NACDL, said Millivision "seems <br>
to be highly intrusive and a violation of the Fourth <br>
Amendment, which guarantees the right to be secure <br>
against unreasonable search and seizure."<br>
<p>
While the NRA approves of the device for use at airports and <br>
for tracking down illegal drug activity ( statist air-brains ), <br>
they point out that 31 states have laws that protect the right <br>
to carry concealed weapons. In other words, it's OK to kill the<br>
Fourth Amendment if it stops nonviolent voluntary drug activity<br>
-- in other words, kiss your freedoms goodbye.<br>
<p>
The Times article also states that:<br>
<p>
        "A Los Angeles Times poll last week found that <br>
        58 percent of Americans would be willing to lose <br>
        some civil liberties to help thwart terrorism."<br>
<p>
As it has been said "Those who are willing to give up freedom <br>
for security will soon have neither." Yet people are trained in <br>
public schools that the government -- i.e., that the 'legal' use <br>
of violent force -- is a cuddly and warm teddy-bear that makes <br>
everything wonderful and should be embraced whenever a problem <br>
appears to arise. It follows therefore that it is safe to <br>
surrender liberty to the govt. And indeed govt is going <br>
to keep us secure, very very secure -- HELP! let me go.<br>
