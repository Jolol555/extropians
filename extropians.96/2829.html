<i>&gt;I have been considering this thought which is throughout the animal kingdom</i><br>
<i>&gt;males have more beauty and special characteristics and the females are the</i><br>
<i>&gt;boring looking type so why has this situation reversed with humans? and</i><br>
<i>&gt;what caused it? or is it only my perception? If you look at the male and</i><br>
<i>&gt;female human form, females are more elegant and graceful. Men appear bland</i><br>
<i>&gt;and boring and not that graceful at all. Is it due to the fact that I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;looking at it from the first person perspective rather than from a third</i><br>
<i>&gt;person perspective where I would consider things differently if I were</i><br>
<i>&gt;another type of intelligent animal looking at the human form? Am I the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;one who shares this view?</i><br>
<p>
Some unrelated thoughts:<br>
* This does not occur "throughout the animal kingdom" -- it's just fairly<br>
common, and we notice the cases that conform.<br>
<p>
* Human females don't have to hide themselves and their young from predators<br>
the way other animals do.<br>
<p>
* The point is to attract attention.  Since humans have forebrains, males<br>
can attract attention by being witty or rich rather than attractive.<br>
Nice clothes, fast cars, and wizzy tech toys can also take the place<br>
of plumage.<br>
<p>
* Taller males are generally considered more attractive (I'm speaking<br>
statistically here); so are stronger ones.  Hairiness goes in and out.<br>
These are forms of natural human "plumage".<br>
<p>
* Human females have forebrains, too, and they don't go into heat and become<br>
primally irresistible for a week per year, and they may well want sex when<br>
nobody's paying attention, so they've developed sophisticated strategies<br>
for getting the attention of the most desirable males.<br>
<p>
* Males in aboriginal cultures wear feathers, beads, warpaint, or whatever,<br>
and probably gain more physical proficiency than American males from<br>
having to do things like tribal dancing, stalking prey, etc., thus<br>
conforming more to your norm.<br>
<p>
* An alien looking down would probably not see much difference, from a<br>
biological standpoint.<br>
<p>
* Your "first person perspective" has "hetero male" written all over it.<br>
A gay male (or anyone attracted to males sexually) might beg to differ.<br>
<p>
* Mikhail Barishnikov and Gary Hines are both very graceful, thanks.<br>
