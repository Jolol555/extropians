IAN: Eyewitness Lou Desyron (ABC World News Sunday, 07/21/96) reported:<br>
<p>
                We saw what appeared to be a flare <br>
                going straight up.  As a matter of <br>
                fact, we thought it was from a boat. <br>
                It was a bright reddish-orange color. <br>
                ...once it went into flames, I knew <br>
                that wasn't a flare.<br>
<p>
Now she did not say "Navy vessel," nor does she seem 100% positive it was<br>
from a boat, however, when we also consider that the area off-shore was<br>
reserved for navel maneuvers that night, and that such were reported early <br>
on, and that witnesses saw flares being dropped before the explosion <br>
(flares are used to divert the course of heat-seeking missiles), it <br>
follows logically that the Navy must be a suspect. It is not unreason-<br>
able to speculate that the Navy was conducting missile related exer-<br>
cises in the area and a missile hit an unintended target. <br>
