Noam Chomsky says:<br>

<i>&gt; responsive to the public and which the public can indeed influence.  So</i><br>
<i>&gt; you end up supporting centralized state power even though you oppose it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; People who think there is a contradiction in that just aren't thinking</i><br>

<p>
 IAN: I see no logical distinction between Chomsky and Marx.<br>
 His claim of Anarchy is a naked sham, it's the same "withering <br>
 away of the State" nonsense that Marx talked about. He's trying<br>
 to slap a "decentralized anarchy" label on 100% pure totalitarianism,<br>
 and this act is 100% pure fraud.<br>
<p>
Lloyd Miller cuts to the core of the issue observing:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Lloyd's Comment:  Is this guy just unaware that the Federal Government,</i><br>
<i> &gt; from the Federal Reserve to the FDA to the FTA and the rest of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; alphabet soup is the prized possession of the major Corporations and that</i><br>
<i> &gt; they, and only they, can control the Federal Government?  And what about</i><br>
<i> &gt; the Corporations' power to put over GATT, the WTO, NAFTA, etc ETC?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: Exactly. This is the core reality people on both sides of the isle<br>
need to see -- and I think libertarians do for the most part -- that <br>
what we call the "govt" is merely a MASK of the mega-wealthy who want<br>
to gain market control via mechanism other than consumer selection.<br>
Whatever grows the govt, gives more power to a core mega-wealthy cabal.<br>
<p>
They have carefully devised a philosophy of universal social <br>
debt that is designed to bind all men to one another under the debt <br>
masters who are the central planning elite that will own the whole <br>
world, and this is the dream of the "New World Order," a term coined <br>
by these very central planners (the proof this conspiracy there for <br>
all to see and is outlined in the book Non Dare Call it Conspiracy) <br>
The philosophy they've poromoted is: socialism. The mega-wealthy <br>
hide behind the mask of socialism -- yet their only as hidden <br>
as people are determined not to see what the facts reveal.<br>
<p>
What better way to sell slavery than to sugarcoat it with humanitarian<br>
candies: We all need to come together, one big family, caring for one <br>
another, breaking down our walls, opening our bank accounts to the <br>
masters that will oversee our debt to one another. Notice that that<br>
sales pitch went from fallacy to fact. But in real life that's not<br>
how they sell slavery, it's all sugar coated with socialistic <br>
candies and we're being feed this brain-rot from cradle to grave.<br>
<p>
Libertarians are so bludgeoned and battle weary that they surrender the <br>
fight, they join forces with the State and stand against those "nuts" who <br>
talk about "New World Order conspiracy" -- crazy wacky bad stuff. Yet, the <br>
facts of conspiracy are just sitting there for all to see -- that is, that <br>
the BIG money from the wealthiest on Earth has been funding leftist global<br>
ideology since the Bolshevik revolution, the same financial core. <br>
<p>
We ignore the facts of the New World Order being built around us at<br>
our own peril. It is clear to see that the real planners who run the <br>
govt are not concerned with the conclusion of the last centuries economic<br>
experiment that proves smaller govt is most advantageous to maximizing <br>
socail outcomes. They are plowing full steam ahead -- the very same <br>
central cabal, the CFR, Rockefellers et al -- with unlimited govt growth. <br>
<p>
New World Serfdom is their plan for our future. I believe, they've concluded<br>
that the Middle Ages is the most ideally stable form of society for those <br>
at the top.  People may laugh at the idea that the mega-wealthy have much<br>
control over State power, or that they have formed a trust that wields this<br>
power into a unified trust, nevertheless, the facts are there to see for <br>
those who dare to open their eyes, and ignoring the facts, they forsake <br>
their children's future. There is a hope because their control is not <br>
perfect, but it does grow, and it grows in direct proportion to that <br>
of the growth of the State, for they are the real State, the <br>
politicians we see are their puppets.<br>
<p>
Take it from a man who knows first hand, Benjamin Disreal, <br>
Britain's Victorian Prime Minister, who observed sagely:<br>
<p>
        The world is governed by very different <br>
        personages from what is imagined by those <br>
        who are not behind the scenes.<br>
<p>
Ergo: the people we see on TV are puppets of unseen masters.<br>
But these masters are quickly exposed by following the BIG money.<br>
<p>
I think as both Lloyd Miller and James Daugherty have clearly stipulated, <br>
the advance of a radical environmentalist anti-human agenda is the most <br>
sure measure of the worst-case scenario that the central cabal has decided <br>
that Middle Age serfdom is the direction they will try to steer the world <br>
in -- and their doing it. State power does work to destroy prosperity <br>
and freedom. The Middle Ages existed before and they can exist again.<br>
