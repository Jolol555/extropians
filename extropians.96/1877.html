IAN: I guess you hadn't noticed, but India is one of the most <br>
heavily bureaucratized and economically nationalized nations of <br>
the "Western" democracies. The Indian govt, having largely crushed <br>
native free enterprise, quickly accepts big foreign investment<br>
deals that put big-bucks into the coffers of politicians. <br>
<p>
Ignoring the anti-laissez faire facts, one promotes the economic <br>
autarchy and nationalist socialism that will keep those "lower <br>
class" workers from ever having job options other than govt <br>
service jobs that have produced only crushing serfdom. If <br>
multi-national employment does the same for workers, it's <br>
because the politicians have worked hard to prevent any <br>
outcome for the population other than poverty.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; The reason they want it? Because we have kept them so destitute that they </i><br>
<i> &gt; will do anything to survive. I see something immoral in keeping a section </i><br>
<i> &gt; of populace as cheap reserve labour for our needs. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Considering the endemic poverty in third world nations has been <br>
caused by the anti-capitalist measures you endorse, your hardly in any <br>
position to point the finger at capitalists. But then, as I've shown, <br>
logical thinking is hardly the forte of socialists. The more effectively <br>
they can conceal the role of govt in the every tragedies they bemoan, <br>
the more effectively they can ensure continuing State power and the<br>
subjugation of the masses to the service of the central planners.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; shirts made in Haiti by women paid seven cents an hour and sold for twenty </i><br>
<i> &gt; seven  dollars. Where does the money go?  I see something immoral there.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: The Haitian govt has largely crushed the free <br>
enterprise of its people. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;Okay, sure. Money's fine as a reprensentative device. But currently it is </i><br>
<i> &gt;not doing a good job. And, our system demands that everybody gets as much </i><br>
<i> &gt;money as possible. Within a commune, people grow a lot of stuff, instead </i><br>
<i> &gt;of haing backyards that just look pretty, they can grow food. What they </i><br>
<i> &gt;can't grow they get from other communes. But the thing is, everybody does </i><br>
<i> &gt;what they can. One thing I like about both </i><br>
<i> &gt;sides of Anarchy is that they are totally dynamic. A system can change </i><br>
<i> &gt;easily to meet needs. If one commune screws up, the people can leave and </i><br>
<i> &gt;go their individual ways.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Out of hundreds of communal experiments across the U.S., none prove <br>
to be dynamic systems that foster material progress and/or innovation.<br>
They are, for the most part, stagnant backwaters that quickly fall apart.<br>
Realizing the failure of voluntary collectivism, the socialists then<br>
call for forceing everyone into a grand central socialist plan.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; The fact that all his stuff is built on the information the establishment </i><br>
<i> &gt; feeds is amazing. A wonderful example of biting the hand that feeds.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Ya right, Noam Chomsky supports big govt.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Hmm, maybe. Co-ops don't work well on a large scale, unlike cults or </i><br>
<i> &gt; corporations. Where they do work, however, is in the industries that are </i><br>
<i> &gt; the most exploited. Agriculture, for example, has always worked better </i><br>
<i> &gt; with labour coops than corporate farming. As I said before, I am looking </i><br>
<i> &gt; into starting a software co-op, but who knows what may happen.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Cooperative farming is not illegal in the U.S., but <br>
it does not seem that have blown out the competition.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;  But you, with your business, are not hampered by anything like morals. </i><br>
<i> &gt; So it is perfectly acceptable for you to fire anyone who tries to </i><br>
<i> &gt; campaign for better working conditions. You may be more properous, and </i><br>
<i> &gt; you may be freer. But the people you employ won't be, and they are far </i><br>
<i> &gt; more numerous than you.      </i><br>
<p>
IAN: The average person in the nation in which employers are free to <br>
fire, is a wealthier person than average people anywhere on earth. This <br>
right here shows that you believe it is wrong to be able to fire a worker, <br>
and thus that free association is wrong -- hardly anarchistic and clearly<br>
promoting of State regulation.<br>
