Re males look drabber than females, in humans, whereas they get to<br>
evolutionary colorful roles ( ie dress better) in birds, etc<br>

* Your "first person perspective" has "hetero male" written all over it.<br>
A gay male (or anyone attracted to males sexually) might beg to differ.<br>

* Mikhail Barishnikov and Gary Hines are both very graceful, thanks.<br>

Good post K, you covered a lot. <br>
I think men are far more beautiful than women, <br>
personally. They have facial hair, musculature, <br>
grace and stature... We are simply inundated with<br>
male dominated advertising, literally bombarded <br>
with thousands of pretty girls so we have become <br>
brainwashed to think it is the thing we must adulate.<br>
<p>
An artist friend of mine complained about having to<br>
look at so many pretty girls til he felt they were <br>
becoming devalued, he said<br>
"look, if we were told WARTS were beautiful <br>
ten thousand times we would believe it."<br>
<p>
I think men are more physically alluring, but they <br>
sure have decided to dress in drab clothing, maybe <br>
it is fear.<br>
