Youare erroneously assuming it to be a mistake. Mistake for whome? if we<br>
are to replace the old memes with the new, we must hijack the most<br>
sacred symbols, dates, etc of the old paradigms, just as Christianity<br>
did with pagan religions, if we are to replace the old outdated modes<br>
and philosophies with the new. I think Newtonmas is a great idea, and<br>
would help bring the reverence for the day back in my opinion for all<br>
those of science and technology who have abandoned or at least gotten<br>
away from their traditional religious practices. THis is why I proposed<br>
MIKEYMAS(tm), since I actually have a day named after me. if we create<br>
our own calendar of holidays and make a practice of celebrating on those<br>
day instead of traditional ones, or celebrating on traditional days, but<br>
for different reasons, as we individuals become more influential in the<br>
cyberculture, our practices will become more popular.<br>
<p>
Now, who wants to have a virgin birth? Be martyred? Exiled? Wander in<br>
the desert? We need volunteers people!!!!!<br>
