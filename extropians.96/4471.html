In a message dated 96-12-18 23:12:57 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The elite would have the highest processing speed and the poor<br>
 would have low processing speeds. It would be very nearly impossible to<br>
 contact someone with a higher speed than you which means that the poor<br>
 would have a more difficult time climbing to the top and have to steal<br>
 timeslices. (Am I going a little too far?) &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Communicating in real time might be difficult but the uploaded have not would<br>
still be able to publish its ideas.  In this way it could possible work its<br>
way up.  <br>
<p>
Uploads would probably desire a physical body of some kind.  In this case,<br>
those with higher processing speeds would be better able to control multiple<br>
bodies.  They would build up wealth and control more bodies.  The poor could<br>
do this but it would take more time.  The same is true of our society today.<br>
 <br>
<p>
My personal view is that individual identity will cease to have meaning in a<br>
world of uploads.  Communication between individuals could be so complete<br>
that one could not tell where one ends and the other begins.  <br>
