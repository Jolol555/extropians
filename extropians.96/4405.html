TOKYO (Dec 20, 1996 10:30 a.m. EST) - Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co. Ltd.<br>
said Friday it had developed the first human-shaped robot which can move<br>
independently and do basic manual tasks.<br>
<p>
The result of 10 years of research, the battery-powered robot is six feet<br>
tall, weighs 462 pounds and looks like an astronaut in a space suit.<br>
<p>
The robot has an autonomous control process and can walk and go up and down<br>
stairs or slopes without having to have detailed walking instructions input,<br>
Honda said.<br>
<p>
It can change directions and correct its balance automatically if pushed,<br>
the company said.<br>
<p>
It can also be moved by radio remote control.<br>
<p>
Honda said the robot can do various jobs with two hands, making it useful<br>
for tasks that would be dangerous or strenuous for humans.<br>
<p>
"The robot has big potential for future use in many fields, for research in<br>
dangerous areas, nursing, and other purposes," executive vice president<br>
Hiroyuki Yoshino said in an interview.<br>
<p>
"We intend to continue development to see how we can use this technology for<br>
practical use," said Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president and chief<br>
executive officer.<br>
<p>
Thirty engineers have worked on the development of the robot.<br>
