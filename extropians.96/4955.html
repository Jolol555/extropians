<i>&gt;I've always heard that "Aryan" as applied to Europeans is pure baloney</i><br>
<i>&gt;(it belongs properly to India and Iran).  Am I behind the times?</i><br>
<p>
This confusion may stem from the myths that have been propogated <br>
around the concept of Aryan.  According to ancient history scholars, <br>
two sets of nomadic tribes living on the fringes of the Fertile Crescent <br>
began a series of raids on agricultural tribes in the interior <br>
shortly after developing bronze weaponry.  One set of tribes is referred <br>
to as Aryan (I'm blanking on what the others were called).  The Aryan <br>
culture was characterized by a worship of war gods symbolized by sun <br>
and sword symbols which supposedly had an effect on Judaism.<br>
<p>
The Viking conquests, on the other hand, were originated by bands of <br>
economically dispossessed young men from Iceland and Greenland who <br>
conducted lightening raids along coastal Europe, eventually settling <br>
amongst the communities they raided.  All of our words in English <br>
dealing with ordinary household items stem from Viking linguistic <br>
influence.<br>
<p>
Thus ends my history lecture for today!<br>
