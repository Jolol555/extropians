Are we here to promote the spread of the memes or just sit on our asses<br>
discussing it? I see many extropians wanting to keep the list isolated. Sure<br>
it's completely normal for the signal to noise ratio to change with the<br>
incoming newbies! Maybe I'm missing something here? We *DO* want these<br>
technologies to be our future as fast as possible or do we wish them to be<br>
merely idle fantasies of our minds? Also we *MUST* vary our topics! We keep<br>
discussing AI, Nano, and uploading constantly! I'm actually beginning to<br>
believe the ravings of Mark Plus that extropians keep discussing the same<br>
topics without making any such progress. I would *VERY MUCH* like to see<br>
what is being worked on in a hands-on manner. There *MUST* be other topics<br>
other than the onces discussed frequently. For example telepresence, global<br>
climate control, new space tech such as the roton and methods for FTL<br>
travel. There are literally *HUNDREDS* of topics on Anders page and we<br>
concentrate on 5-10% of them? Sure the big three extropian topics are the<br>
most important but we *NEED* variety. One of the best methods for new<br>
inspiration is to focus on another topic and work on that and then return to<br>
the first topic with a entirely new burst of inspiration. By focusing on the<br>
same topic, we make little bouts of progress and rather stagnate in our own<br>
idea pool.<br>
