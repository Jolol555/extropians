<i>&gt;     In our present society, where scarciety rules and it is necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt;retain privacy of ideas which might produce wealth for oneself, it seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;that some kind of privacy is necessary.</i><br>
<p>
What about ideas which might be demonized by irrational or coercive people<br>
(witness Nazi Germany)?  What about not wanting to be ogled naked in your<br>
living room by every lecher who might wander by?  What about not wanting<br>
anybody to know about the surprise party you're planning for someone, lest<br>
word get back to them and the treat be ruined?  What about wanting to avoid<br>
telling what you know about something that you are proud of but happens to<br>
be illegal?  I could think of many such examples, but I have other things<br>
to do -- I hope this gets across the point that I can have reasons for<br>
wanting privacy that have nothing to do with shame or avarice.<br>
