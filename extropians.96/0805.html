<p>
Uploading is impossible on von Neumann machines. Even semiconductor <br>
lithography is insufficient, dedicated maspar molecular hardware is <br>
required. Nothing less will serve. With semiconductor technology, only <br>
insect equivalents are implementable. These are virtually useless, since <br>
&lt;&lt;H, but will bring us robust nonalgorithmic systems which we currently lack.<br>
<p>
A human equivalent as implemented in molecular circuitry is thought in <br>
reside in a volume ranging from a sugar cube to an orange (with cooling,<br>
packaging, interfacing, etc. about the size of the fridge), and run at <br>
1..10^3 realtime speed. Power burn might lie in kW range.<br>
<p>
Nanoists will claim much better performance in a much smaller package, <br>
but I tend to be less optimistic, as practicablity of strong Drexlerian <br>
nanotechnology has not been demonstrated yet. Anyway, diamond rod logic <br>
is too slow in comparision to molecular switches, which operate on <br>
electronically excited molecular states/quantum dot arrays.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Honestly, am I the only extropian who likes the flesh?</i><br>
<p>
You might have no choice. You seem to assume that &gt;H level intelligences <br>
to be actively benign, leaving you a sufficient part of resources. I <br>
suspect the scenario to be Darwinian/ALifish, where first the easily <br>
accessable (Belt, Kuiper, Oort, atmosphereless satellites) resources get <br>
rapidly depleted, then, should "transcension" be impossible, planets to <br>
become disassembled (crude ad hoc method: first turn a fraction of the <br>
Moon into Earth-orbiting intelligent mirrors/solar sailers, burn away the <br>
atmosphere by focusing reflected light, wait for the surface to cool, <br>
deposit autoreplicators to fashion mass separators/mass drivers -- voila! <br>
Earth is ready for dissassembling. Doubtlessly, a &gt;H will find much more <br>
elegant means...).<br>
<p>
Should above scenario to become true, you'd be offered a free ride to <br>
uploading, in the best case. In the worst case... watch the sky burn. It <br>
will be painless... almost.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Maybe I should form a faction of tech fiends who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sleazy enough to appreciate the aesthetics and primal joy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of a fit sweaty body.  Maybe I'm just an immortalist who</i><br>
<p>
I doubt you would notice the difference, if anaethesized, (destructively) <br>
scanned with sufficient resolution, a model of you abstracted &amp; <br>
downloaded, short-time memory deleted (that will be probably an artefact of <br>
the vitrification).<br>
<p>
Artificial (not virtual) reality, if properly done, is indistinguishable <br>
from real reality from the user front end. Virtual sweat stings just like <br>
real one, should you crave the sensation.<br>
<p>
However, AR does not _require_ a body. In fact burning additional <br>
computatational resources for rendering a nice AR landscape _and_ <br>
maintaining a proper body model might be considered a handicap. You might <br>
be outperformed by others entities, who do not require such additional <br>
resources. <br>
<p>
Darwin days, even in the digital Eden. <br>
<p>
Unless computation can be detached from material carrier (transcension), it <br>
will be limited by available signal delay latency/circuitry/energy flux <br>
-- which are scarce resources.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinks the whole universe should be our domain.  I guess I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wouldn't mind being able to have alternate _identities_  of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;man, machine, cyborg, virtual entity--but I certainly don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;want to be constrained to one. [snip]. </i><br>
<p>
Again, you might not have the choice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Anyone else out there feel remotely the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This issue came up when I was debating Paulina Boorsook on the BrainTennis</i><br>
<i>&gt; forum of HotWired. She was under the impression that all Extropians dislike,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hate, fear, or feel uncomfortable in their physical bodies, and that we're</i><br>
<p>
This body is both mortal, and easily destroyed. Using the same reasoning, <br>
one might be tempted to remain in the womb forever -- purportedly, it's <br>
pretty cozy there.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, growing up is a natural process. Rarely does one profit who <br>
yearns to remain an irresponsible child forever.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; all hell bent on dumping them. This may be true for some, but I know enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians to know it's not generally true.</i><br>
<p>
Whoever does not feel comfortable within his body is slightly neurotic at <br>
best, and obviously should strive to remedy this unsatisfactory condition.<br>
 <br>
Whoever choses to ignore a vital opportunity, must be prepared to accept <br>
the implications arising from that choice.<br>
<p>
Darwin days, childhood's end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree with you, Tim, in that I want a *choice* of bodies, physical and</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtual. I take great pleasure in my current physical body and spend</i><br>
<i>&gt; considerable time and energy to keep it in condition. Like any Extropian, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to add to my body's abilities and to be able to modify its responses</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to my will rather than leaving its responses and capacities</i><br>
<i>&gt; primarily an accident of my genes. Eventually, assuming I make it to that</i><br>
<p>
Tinkering with the DNA is nontrivial (one cannot modify morphogenesis <br>
programme in an adult, one has to rewrite it), and has its limits, which <br>
are artefacted by this universe's physics. AR has none, since you define <br>
your own physics. How's that for a god?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; time, I expect to see this body--or whatever it has become--as only one</i><br>
<i>&gt; among a choice of physical vehicles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tim, your comment suggests you think you might be the only one who</i><br>
<i>&gt; appreciates the way of flesh among Extropians. That's certainly not true. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know many of us who love working out, having sex, hiking, surfing, skiing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; swimming, etc. I think it's a big mistake to give the impression to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public that Extropians reject the physical body. Maybe a few seek to live as</i><br>
<i>&gt; utterly disembodied thinkers, but most of us want to enjoy all the means of</i><br>
<i>&gt; being in contact with reality, including physical sensations and perceptions.</i><br>
<p>
Should AR be indistinguishable from RR (real reality), where's difference?<br>
 <br>
