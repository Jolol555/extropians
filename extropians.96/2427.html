<p>
The confusion found in early myths may be a function of the methods of<br>
storytelling prevelent in that era, rather than confusion about the stories<br>
themselves. Certain cultures regard myth as power, and therefore only<br>
release certain details in any single account, either to society as a whole,<br>
or to individuals, who are expected to form their own myth versions as they<br>
mature. Furthermore, myths can be deliberately 'mutated' to produce flawed<br>
versions which allow maintenance of a power base amongst those who have the<br>
'true' version.<br>
<p>
This explanation of lack of clarity would be confirmed if the creation and<br>
cosmos mythologies were created contemporaneously, and if knowledge of the<br>
creation myth could be shown to endow an individual with more 'power' or<br>
'kudos' than the cosmology myths.<br>
<p>
The creation myths may become more clear if analysed from a structuralist<br>
perspective, a la Levi-Strauss, whereby meta-narrative is created by finding<br>
parallels of constructive device and key role assignments within the various<br>
forms of the myth.<br>
<p>
Just an idea.<br>
