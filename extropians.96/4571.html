Uploads cannot be run on a sequential/von Neumann machine (unless you <br>
happen to have several spare MYrs, and are interested in actually <br>
watching the Sun go off the main sequence). Competition for <br>
computational resources and bandwidth both should be very real, though. <br>
This should cause streamlined designs to overwhelm the more baroque, <br>
barnacle-encrusted natural ones, on the middle to long run.<br>
 <br>

<p>
A world which can fabricate uploads will look drastically different than <br>
our current one. I'd consider the delta to be at least as large as <br>
between a neolithical village, and modern Manhattan. Should future things <br>
even slightly follow predicted dynamics, we will see some wildly <br>
improbable things happening. Few days ago, I've picked up a nice SciFi <br>
novel. It is called "Particle Physics and Astrophysics", and it is <br>
quite outdated, since published in 1989. If you are tracking IT progress, <br>
and remember how leisurly things used to happen back then, in 1983, or <br>
so, the dynamics of end-1996, at least for me, are at times frightening <br>
(also, quite depressing, but that is another story). But we ain't seen <br>
nothing yet! How's that for frightening?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Uploads would probably desire a physical body of some kind.  In this case,</i><br>
<p>
Why should they? Transmuting asteroidal material into circuitry, and <br>
other machinery will be a low-level function, and communicating with <br>
slow, stupid humans (slowing your timebase for them? why, on earth?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; those with higher processing speeds would be better able to control multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt; bodies.  They would build up wealth and control more bodies.  The poor could</i><br>
<p>
Why do you need your body now? Because it is your interface with the only <br>
reality you know. But uploads live in vastly richer version of it, in the <br>
artifical reality. This is not escapism. Quite the vice versa: humans <br>
will have to protect their bit'o garden from greedy machines, ready to <br>
chew up inhabited planets for breakfast. Pulling the plug? Ridiculous.<br>
We won't shut them down, they will us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; do this but it would take more time.  The same is true of our society today.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; My personal view is that individual identity will cease to have meaning in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; world of uploads.  Communication between individuals could be so complete</i><br>
<p>
While this is possible, we might wind up with a hierarchy of <br>
metaindividuals, just a more pronounced version of what we have now.<br>
