In a message dated 96-11-05 05:59:48 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Also, by your own argument above, would not a more useful meme (and one<br>
fairly<br>
 current) be "I am responsible for my own life".  <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Very good.  This is close to "We are all self employed".  The only difference<br>
is that being self employed means being responsible to yourself AND to your<br>
"customer".  <br>
<p>
I think WaaSE is *better* because IARFM-Own-L could mean a win-lose "kill the<br>
other guy" situation.  WaaSE means only Win-Win. Win-lose is undesirable.  I<br>
still like WaaSE: responsibility for BOTH buyer and seller e.g. even trade.  <br>
<p>
Giving a gift to someone implies an even trade in exchange, not altruism and<br>
not theft.   Even giving a gift of a kidney the "seller" (giver)  gets a<br>
feeling of worth (saving a person's life) as "payment" from the "buyer".   I<br>
think this is the PROFIT in helping people.  Not true altruism.<br>
