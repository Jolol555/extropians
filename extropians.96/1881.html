I don't see this as the "norm".  I think people DO look for win-win deals.<br>
The "victim" deals: lose-lose, lose-win and win-lose are undesirable.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; It has occurred to me that we indeed may have a long road to get "from<br>
here<br>
 to there.."  Hopefully not one strewn with stragglers and throwaways.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm sorry you feel that way.  I don't.   I think we are doing very well<br>
compared to _any_ other time.  We have only _temporary_ setbacks (e.g., USSR)<br>
as far as I can see. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; I wonder how one thinks people will learn to think in ways that make us<br>
 honest, self worthy, independent and prosperous.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I think people _have_ learned:  The WIN-WIN. <br>
(Earlier, I gave an example of a win-win deal:)   <br>
 <br>
I worked for Dole Packaged Foods.  Everyone I knew liked working for Dole<br>
until something better came along. . . Then quit.  We negotiated a better<br>
deal with Dole than anything else at the time (win-win).  Dole wins, I win<br>
and Dole's customer's win.  Everybody wins.  If Dole was so evil, they would<br>
have paid us ALL minimum wage (win-lose) and we would have quit (lose-lose).<br>
  And when we had a better deal someplace else,  we could have stayed at Dole<br>
(lose-win).   Nobody I know chose any "lose" (victim) situations.  <br>
<p>
Now if only more governments could learn this:  Prices are negotiated not<br>
mandated (unless by socialist governments).  The buyer and seller have to be<br>
satisfied or there is NO deal.  Win-win deals survive and get better overtime<br>
with only temporary setbacks.   <br>
