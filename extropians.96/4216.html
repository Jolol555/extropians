That's another of the classic time management techniques. Its really all<br>
about what you commit to doing; commit to others and to yourself. Once you<br>
have made the committment you are less likely to break the promise, even to<br>
yourself. <br>
<p>
The next thing is to stick to the plan despite the "tyranny of the urgent."<br>
Many peple think that important and urgent are synonymous - they aren't.<br>
Often urgent things interrupt important things. "This will just take a<br>
second." It never does.<br>

I like that! I'm gonna try it.<br>

<p>
I can relate to that! But as we all know, managers don't really DO<br>
anything. :-) Seriously, I've heard many managers (myself included) say "I<br>
worked my butt off today, I'm beat and I didn't accomplish anything."<br>
Reveiwning the to-do list during the day and especially the NEXT day gives<br>
you a sense of what you did and where you spent your time.<br>
<p>
Some little techniques I picked up over the years:<br>
<p>
1. During the day record how long you spend on dfferent tasks. When I was<br>
filling out a weekly time card for accounting it really helped to be able<br>
to review the week and know where the time was spent so I didn't spend 30<br>
minutes "making up" the numbers. Since I was always carrying my planner<br>
(but not the time card) I drew an arrow on the daily schedule from the<br>
tasks start to end time and jotted a 2 word note like "strat mtg." This<br>
helped me remember when and how long I wasted, that is, spent in a strategy<br>
meeting.<br>
<p>
2. In the intro to _Don't Shoot the Dog_ about training and behavior<br>
modification the author mentions that "studies show" people who completely<br>
fill in the little box instead of making check marks or X's tend to stick<br>
to their plans (diets and exercise routines) more than the checkers and<br>
Xers. This sounded so absurd I had to try it. Well it works - at least for<br>
me. I think its because it takes less than a second to make a check or X<br>
while coloring in that box completely (and doing a good job) takes 3-4<br>
seconds at least. During that time I concentrate on the fact that I have<br>
COMPLETED something and can revel in the glow, however briefly. Half a<br>
second just ain't long enough to let the sense of accomplishment sink in.<br>
Also, I find a series of filled-in boxes more visually striking than a line<br>
of X's and therefore at the end of the day I feel more successful.<br>
<p>
3. When I do a task that wasn't on my list (e.g. an emergency) I put it on<br>
the list so I can fill in another box. I get my 3-4 second instant<br>
gratification and cheap thrill and I lengthen the string of filled in boxes<br>
for future gloating.<br>
<p>
While we're on the subject of management, the best management book I've<br>
found is _The Tao of Leadership_ by John Heider. Its a translation of the<br>
Tao Te Ching with a slant towards leadership. I read it straight through<br>
preiodically but I also use it as a daily oracle. I keep it in my desk and<br>
open to a random page every morning before the day gets started. For a book<br>
that was writen over 2500 years ago it certainly is applicable today.<br>
