<p>
Ray, you would be perfect for this.  I don't know the 1997 schedule of <br>
classes.  The address and phone are:  <br>
<p>
American Sanskrit Institute<br>
73 Four Corners Road <br>
Warwick, N.Y.  10990 <br>
<p>
(914) 986-8652<br>
<p>
Warwick is about 60 miles north of New York City.  That's where <br>
the residential classes are.  Short courses are given in NYC and various <br>
other cities.  When Vyaas started out he did everything himself, but <br>
now some of his students are advanced enough to take over some of the <br>
out of town classes, so he stays in Warwick most of the time.  I think <br>
your experience of Sanskrit would be the same, whether you study <br>
under Vyaas himself or one of his students.  <br>
<p>
Namaste' <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
