Thanks Tom, but this description seriously short-changes Natasha's input.<br>
She did far more than add some "nice typographic elements". She created the<br>
main image for the cover, and as Art Director either created or helped shape<br>
many of the layouts in the issue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;very well), and several adjunct editors put in long hours.</i><br>
<p>
This seems like a good time to clarify: I said that there are two people on<br>
the production team. That's the in-house production team who put the issue<br>
together, do all the design, layout, and production. In addition, there are<br>
editors who sometimes help get articles into shape. This time, rather than<br>
"several adjunct editors" let me thank publically the two who helped out:<br>
Eric Watt Forste for co-editing the Advances section, and T.O. Morrow for<br>
his roles both as Politics Editor and Puzzles Editor (the latter,<br>
unfortunately not credited). <br>
<p>
I wish there were more editors to help gather and edit material for Extropy.<br>
If you are interested in taking on an area of particular interest to you,<br>
please contact me at: extropy@extropy.org<br>

<i>&gt;One thing I especially like about this issue:  It highlights the work of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian women.  They earned some justly deserved credit for enriching</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanist thought.</i><br>
<p>
I intend to continue giving appropriate attention to extropic women as well<br>
as men. I don't believe in affirmative action (i.e. reverse discrimination)<br>
but I do believe in giving attention where it's due.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I thank everyone who helped produce EXTROPY -- and everyone who consumes it!</i><br>
<p>
My thanks especially to those of you who subscribe and thereby support the<br>
existence of the only magazine of its kind. And to those extropians who are<br>
not subscribers I ask -- why not?! (Subscription info is available on<br>
request, or on the ExI web site: <a href="http://www.extropy.org">http://www.extropy.org</a>)<br>
<p>
Praise for the magazine is always enjoyable, but I'd also enjoy input on<br>
what you the readers would like to see more (or less) of.<br>
