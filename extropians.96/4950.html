<p>
The Russians are using something similar to VX called VM-50(proper<br>
designation?).  Both VX and VM-50 are gelled forms of the nerve gas soman<br>
and have a persistence ranging from monthes to years depending on<br>
environmental conditions.  This persistence is by design.  VX is actually an<br>
American invention, not Russian.  It is a binary composed of two much less<br>
toxic components.  I am not sure to what you are referring when you say "one<br>
order of magnitude better than VX".  The Russians never really used VX.<br>
They may have briefly, but they came up with their own brew.  I understand<br>
that their current chemical weapons array is similar in capability and<br>
nature to ours.  Research in new chemical weapons has become all but<br>
eliminated for both the Russians and the US in the last few years.  Even if<br>
they did come up with something brand new very recently (my information is<br>
from ~1990), it is unlikely it would ever see production.  Heck, most<br>
countries are trying to *decrease* their stockpiles of both chemical AND<br>
nuclear weapons.  The Russians are having real problems with the extensive<br>
quantities and decrepit states of their stockpiles.<br>
<p>
The standard non-persistant nerve gas is Sarin (designation GB).  This gas<br>
has a persistence of a few hours to a few days.  This is also a binary, with<br>
one of the components being isopropyl alcohol.  Not quite as toxic as Soman<br>
either.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, the binary components for both Soman (VX form) and Sarin are<br>
available from open sources.  This information is not protected.<br>

<i>&gt;Apart from the other nasties, the effects of HCN are briefly treated in </i><br>
<i>&gt;"A Higher Form of Killing" by Robert Harris and Jeremy Paxman, 1982.</i><br>
 <br>
Side note:  You can give yourself temporary immunity (a few hours) to<br>
cyanide by injecting solutions of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate.  I<br>
think it would be amusing to see a person on deathrow apparently unaffected<br>
by the gas chamber, much to the horror of everyone else. <br>
