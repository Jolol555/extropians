Swallowing is a very reasonable model for origins of eukaryotes, but neither<br>
the nucleus, with its linear chromosomes, nor the rest of the cell, with its<br>
intricate cytoskeleton, is like any bacteria bopping around today.  The lines<br>
of the swallower and swallowee are probably extinct, regardless of whether<br>
they were prokaryotes or something else.<br>

<p>
The robustness is not well-established but is suspected; eukaryotes have as<br>
much variation in their rRNAs as prokaryotes.  It should be very hard to<br>
generate that much variation without an enormous amount of time.<br>
