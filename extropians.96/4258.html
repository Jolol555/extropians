In a message dated 96-12-18 11:34:27 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Let's turn this thread around and stop looking at<br>
 the topic at hand from a "meta-physical" level and start discussing the<br>
 biological and chemical reasons, as well as the psychological, that these<br>
 events occur.  By understanding why, we can more efficiently help those<br>
 that are asking for aid as well as possibly enhance our own practice and<br>
 experience. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I think you are correct, this need to be done - but for a creative person to<br>
do this would be extremely counter productive.  It is exactly this kind of<br>
state that I try to avoid! <br>
There are some great books out on this subject, one called FLOW byt a guy<br>
whos name I cannot even spell.. something with a lot of consonsants paul<br>
Czwzewjkz??(help- whats his name?)<br>
;- )<br>
Hyperanalytical, thinking too concretely about the process, wondering about<br>
neural networking of my brain - writing about it.  Interferes with flow.<br>
Most creative people don;t usually have time for detailed chemical studies of<br>
their own brain- it's hard to think about that while painting... ;- )<br>
<p>
Now if you find out what this is, access it chemically and make a smart drug<br>
for non artists to join us in our bliss and flow, that would be lovely! But I<br>
have a hint for you - best way to make a muscle grow is to exercise it. <br>
 <br>
I would be happy to partake in a study like this but not to talk too much<br>
about it..<br>
Life is too long, and there are pixels,scultures, oils, and designs that need<br>
my attention!<br>
--- On with the Automorph!<br>
