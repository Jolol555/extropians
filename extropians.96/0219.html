What about the near-future use of cognitive prostheses? I mean neural-net<br>
chips that are trained to mimic functions of very small pieces of human<br>
brain tissue that might be used to cure the kind of aphasias and other<br>
cognitive deficits that small ischemic strokes and other brain injuries can<br>
cause. I think economic demand within the health-care industry will lead to<br>
heavy funding of this technology path, and once the engineering research to<br>
develop silicon cognitive prostheses is well underway, the same<br>
technologies can be used to enhance and expand "normal" function.<br>
<p>
Once people start using silicon neural-nets to expand and enhance normal<br>
brain function, one can imagine a smooth path to a point in which one's<br>
"identity" has gradually moved "into" the silicon prostheses, because<br>
eventually there would simply be more and faster computational power on the<br>
prosthesis side. The sorts of computational structures that neural networks<br>
support (minds, in this case) can be extremely protean and flexible.<br>
<p>
The logical end result of this technology path would be something similar<br>
to Greg Egan's "jewel" or Ndoli device. I don't think the possibility of<br>
soft incremental uploads can be so easily dismissed until after we learn<br>
more about the way neural networks (both artificial and natural) work.<br>
