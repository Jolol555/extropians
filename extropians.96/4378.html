I just thought of something regarding my last mail to Paul Wafker.<br>
<p>
Paul wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My hope would be that by vastly increasing the openness and totally of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;communication with them, their "dogmas" (about me anyway) would be able to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;broken.</i><br>
<p>
I forgot to illustrate the cultural aspect. Cultural differences are already<br>
'public' and i think we've seen little hope for taking away those dogmas,<br>
without creating a situation where everyone 'integrates' into one big world<br>
'monoculture' something i think nobody here really wants (unless ofcourse<br>
one based on THEIR values.)<br>
<p>
To illustrate:<br>
Let's imagine Paul, that a person 'X' who lives in Country 'Y', a country<br>
where it is either Governement policy or cultural tradition to:<br>
<p>
a) be Racist.<br>
or...<br>
b) physically mutilate or have sex with your children<br>
or...<br>
c) give your children drugs, so they will work harder<br>
or...<br>
d) persecute people for their sexuality, religion or political views<br>
<p>
(i'm pretty sure you would understand person 'X' and countries 'Y' reasons<br>
for at least one of these...)<br>
<p>
Now you are person 'Q' living in country 'Z', where it is policy or<br>
tradition to:<br>
<p>
e) throw away enourmous amounts of food and other resources.<br>
or...<br>
f) spend huge amounts of money on medical care for pets.<br>
or...<br>
g) allow all kinds of sexual freedoms, drug addictions, and criminal behaviour.<br>
or...<br>
h) ask money for 'information'  ;-)<br>
<p>
I'm sure person 'X' would have some problems understanding at least one of<br>
these...<br>
    <br>
Many of todays Dogma's are based on what is public knowledge already. Would<br>
you understand and accept person 'X''s personal reasons, for doing, a,b,c<br>
and d, if they were made clear to you by ways that you suggest ? Maybe you<br>
would, maybe i would, but how many other people will ?<br>
<p>
Think about that one for a while...<br>
