<i>&gt;                 &gt;Information itself cannot be moved because it has no                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;physical properties.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me you could make exactly the same argument if you said  </i><br>
<i>&gt; information always moves and can never be brought to a halt, which leads me </i><br>
<i>&gt; to think this is not a fruitful avenue to pursue. </i><br>
<p>
I was saying that you cannot produce a physical or spatial translation of <br>
information without also producing an equal physical or spatial <br>
translation of the encoded substrate.<br>
             <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The physical translation of information from one point in                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;space to another is meaningless in an information context.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it's very meaningful. After Turing machine A produces an output </i><br>
<i>&gt; there will be a delay before Turing machine B can use it, this delay is </i><br>
<i>&gt; proportional to the distance between A and B.</i><br>
<p>
This is a physical context, not an information context.  You are <br>
generating a copy of the output of Turing machine A on Turing machine <br>
B.  The information that is output by Turing machine A exists as soon <br>
as it is generated.  The problem of copy latency is a physical one, <br>
not an informational one.<br>
                    <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If I am not mistaken, the "Information can not be moved,                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;only copied" theorem has been proven  mathematically.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I very much doubt such a murky idea can even be expressed mathematically,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; much less be proved or disproved.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing murky about this at all.  This is a very basic theorem that <br>
has been proven in very concrete terms.  There are many similar <br>
theorems.  A large areas of information theory is counter-intuitive.  <br>
<p>
The science as a whole is very practical and is generally used in the <br>
design of complex, distributed information systems.  Large-scale <br>
distributed databases and distributed operation systems use this <br>
area of mathematics extensively.  In its full scope it also includes <br>
topics such as data compression and cryptography.<br>
<p>
Another interesting mathematically proven theorem of information <br>
science:  It is mathematically impossible for an information agent <br>
(such as humans or computers) to prove that their information is <br>
synchronized with that of another information agent.<br>
<p>
The above theorem is also counter-intuitive (with many implications) <br>
but true nonetheless.   In the real world, distributed systems assume <br>
synchronization because they can't really know.  Humans also "assume" <br>
synchronization, often called "common knowledge".<br>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;I am not saying it is impossible to upload; it is impossible                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;only in the sense of uploading a single, existing stream of                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;consciousness as opposed to creating a new stream of                </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;consciousness. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Every time the telephone rings my stream of consciousness is interrupted, </i><br>
<i>&gt; when you read this post your consciousness is different than it would be if </i><br>
<i>&gt; you were reading another post. I don't see why that is such a big deal that </i><br>
<i>&gt; it makes us different people.</i><br>
<p>
Your consciousness is interrupted, but not terminated.  Our minds, <br>
like most modern operating systems, are event-driven and capable of <br>
running more than one process at the same time, some in the <br>
background, some in the foreground.  If this was not the case, you <br>
would have to think about breathing to make it happen, and a <br>
phone call would make you forget to breathe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If consciousness is based upon information and information                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;processing, my above statements  hold.                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless the religious people are right, consciousness must be based on  </i><br>
<i>&gt; information processing, that's why I don't understand your theory. You're  </i><br>
<i>&gt; saying, I think, that information exists outside our physical universe, </i><br>
<i>&gt; if so  then the information in my head and the information in my upload a </i><br>
<i>&gt; thousand  miles away must be the same, after all you also say " a physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; translation  in space of the substrate is irrelevant".  Also, I don't see why </i><br>
<i>&gt; you keep distinguishing between "originals" and "copies", if your theory is </i><br>
<i>&gt; right then everything in the physical universe is a "copy".   </i><br>
<p>
Information exists in the physical universe, but it has no physical <br>
properties. There is a big difference.  There is no <br>
difference between originals and copies.  The problem starts when <br>
consciousness comes into play.  If you think of your mind as an <br>
instance of a very complex block of information, you create a <br>
situation where a block of information contains the ability to <br>
recognize the difference between itself and all other copies of <br>
itself via the mechanism of self-awareness.  Self-awareness allows <br>
a block of information to uniquely recognize itself without necessarily having <br>
any differences between itself and it's copies.  <br>
<p>
Yes, the copies may be identical, but to the self-aware, they are not <br>
the same as itself.  Other self-aware, exact copies would be <br>
identical to each other from its own viewpoint, though.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If every piece of substrate containing a specific piece of                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;information is destroyed, the information is destroyed                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;permanently. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not necessarily. It would be difficult to destroy the information that  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2 + 2 = 4 because nobody knows where or how it's encoded. Even Shakespeare's </i><br>
<i>&gt; plays could be rediscovered by a monkey banging on a typewriter,  it would </i><br>
<i>&gt; take a long time, but not an infinitely long time. </i><br>
<p>
2 + 2 = 4 is hard to destroy for a number of reasons.  Mostly, <br>
though, it is because it is thoroughly encoded on many, many <br>
substrates throughout the universe.<br>
<p>
As for Shakespeare, you wouldn't know who Shakespeare was if every <br>
bit of information on Shakespeare was destroyed, and therefore, you <br>
couldn't "rediscover" the information.  Rediscovery requires prior <br>
knowledge hence the information could not have been completely <br>
destroyed.  The monkey might <br>
bang out plays, but they would no longer be Shakespeare's plays <br>
because there would be no evidence in the universe that Shakespeare <br>
ever wrote a play.  They would be random noise generated by a monkey <br>
pounding on a typewriter.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To my mind this does indeed give some support to the idea that information  </i><br>
<i>&gt; can exist external to the physical universe, but certainly not to the idea  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that there is a fundamental difference between a copy and an original or that  </i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly the same information can't be encoded in 2 very different ways.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<p>
How information is encoded is irrelevant to the information itself.  <br>
Information *can* be encoded in two different ways, and usually is.  <br>
The way your mind stores a block of text is very different than the <br>
way it is stored on a page, but the information content is the same <br>
either way.<br>
