I do have a complete philosophy, or at least a philosophy that aims at<br>
completeness, and Extropianism is a subset of it. I like to refer to the<br>
more complete system as...<br>
Maxism.<br>
<p>
I've always resisted the idea that Extropianism should aim to be a total<br>
philosophy. For one thing, it worried me. It's okay for me to have a<br>
complete (but revisable) personal philosophy, but I'm concerned that a total<br>
public philosophy is likely to suffer a hardening of the orthodoxies, as<br>
R.A.W. would say. Maybe that's not necessarily the case, so long as the<br>
philosophy declares itself open to revision. That was clearly *not* the case<br>
with Rand's view of Objectivism. She insisted that either you accepted all<br>
of her statement of Objectivism or none of it. (It was logically derived<br>
from axiomatically certain premises, and apparently she was incapable of<br>
error in her logic or the facts they worked on.) Even if a philosophy<br>
declares itself to be open, I suspect that a total philosophy is more open<br>
to abuse than one that stays limited in scope, like Extropianism. I'd be<br>
very interested to hear other people's views on this.<br>
<p>
Secondly, in terms of memetic propagation, if you insist on packing in such<br>
a vast array of attitudes, values, and beliefs into a single philosophical<br>
package, it seems to me that you will limit its appeal (at least to<br>
independent-minded people -- the kind I'm interested in). Extropianism<br>
already limits itself by including a favoring of free markets and<br>
spontaneous order (though it does *not* require anyone to be a hardcore<br>
libertarian to call themselves an Extropian). That's a tradeoff I decided to<br>
make. There can and will be other versions of transhumanism that appeal to<br>
statist-minded people.<br>
