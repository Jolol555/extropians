I'm not sure about you guys on this issue, but I wish to come out and say<br>
right now that I am a strong supporter of capital punishment. So strong in<br>
fact that I wish they'd make it a mega source of profit by pitting<br>
psychotics against each other in an arena something akin to the movie<br>
RunningMan. I believe that if someone kills another person which violates<br>
that person's rights, the killer's rights should then be violated by being<br>
put to death. Some of you may say now with this in mind that I'm a<br>
libertarian with republican veins because I am also for people carrying<br>
arms. In fact I wouldn't care if people carried around concealed thompson<br>
(sp?) submachine guns. How do you guys feel? Am I ludicrius? (damn, I can't<br>
spell tonite)<br>
