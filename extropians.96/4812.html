From: Alexander Chislenko &lt;alexc@firefly.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; For example, the populace that votes for somebody who promised them no</i><br>
<i>&gt; taxes and lots of free booze.  This may look like a good idea to every</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular person, but politically it may be disastrous.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, each individual who votes plays only a microscopic part in the<br>
result of the election.  So you really can't fault people for the way they<br>
vote; the amount of responsibility each one carries is vanishingly small.<br>
<p>
In fact, maybe this is the problem - since people know that their<br>
votes don't really matter, most don't worry much about how they vote.<br>
You could almost see a democratic election as a system designed to<br>
minimize personal responsibility for the outcome, and therefore to ensure<br>
irresponsible results.<br>
