&lt;The technological problems of doing a 'dry' upload are very complex, but <br>
'wet' uploads add another level of complexity since they have to act in a <br>
dynamic system (immune responses, synaptic plasticity, the actions of glia <br>
cells, sudden head movements).&gt;<br>

&lt;They are the non-firing cells that make up 90% of the brain mass. Some of <br>
them seem to give neurons nutrient and isolate them from each other. Others <br>
buffer their electrical activity, taking up ions and<br>
neurotransmittors. And some, the microglia, appear to work as immune cells, <br>
eating junk or damaged cells. There is plenty going on among the cells!&gt;<br>
<p>
There's also a whole theory of glial cells as the agents of consciousness <br>
in the brain (sort of like the arty counterparts of the nerdy neurons).<br>
<p>
Physicist &amp; writer Fred Alan Wolf expounds this theory in the final <br>
chapters of his 1994 book _The Dreaming Universe: A Journey Into the Realm <br>
Where Psyche and Physics Meet_.  Wolf builds on the ideas of physicist <br>
Renato Nobili who has described quantum physical wave equations modeling <br>
the movement of ions in glial cells ("Schrodinger Wave Holography in Brain <br>
Cortex," Physical Review A 32, no.6, 12/85). To Wolf, I think, trying to <br>
develop a holographic model of memory and the mind, neurons are simply the <br>
hardware while the software and memory storage are encoded in the glial <br>
cells.<br>
<p>
The pioneer of the 'holographic mind' meme was neurophysicist Karl Pribram. <br>
 Wolf refers to Pribram's work when he says: "there is no evidence that <br>
anything like computer file management occurs in the brain and mnemonic <br>
recalls do not seem to involve searches through tree patterns or files or <br>
pages."  I'm not sure if this is still *completely* true or not (I'm hoping <br>
to read Bill Calvin's new book _The Cerebral Code_ soon).  Anyway, Wolf <br>
cites evidence that "cortical waves are not directly correlated to cortical <br>
activity.  They appear to persist even when neural activity is <br>
suppressed."<br>
<p>
Wolf admits that the problem with holographic theories of memory retrieval <br>
is that "EEG patterns do not show a sufficiency of small-wavelength <br>
components [and] the smaller the wavelength the greater the amount of <br>
information the wave may encode." Another problem is the lack of a focusing <br>
mechanism in the brain to project and retrieve holographically stored <br>
information.<br>
<p>
Well, Wolf's theory rests on Nobili's equations which supposedly show that <br>
"contrary to light-wave holography, Schrodinger wave holography was far <br>
more efficient in producing holograms in brain tissue ... The key here is <br>
that the whole cortical column [via the quantum actions of ion movements in <br>
the wetware of the glial cells] participates in both the generation of the <br>
holographic wave and its detection.  This is quite different from <br>
light-wave holograms, which are primarily surface or area recordings. <br>
 Next, Schrodinger waves propagate through the medium in a different manner <br>
from light waves ... Thirdly, when Schrodinger waves diffract through the <br>
medium ... they evoke different images from the fixed stored information in <br>
the glial cells.  This amounts to producing time-resolved holograms ... <br>
Fourthly, time-varying information that is recorded in the medium finds its <br>
way to a number of resonators [that] act as transmitters ... so there is no <br>
need to have any focalization devices present."<br>
<p>
This is all very interesting (and even somewhat appealing IMO), BUT, I find <br>
it hard to believe there is so little role for neural nets and the many <br>
functional organs of the brain as Wolf seems to imply.<br>
<p>
_If_ this theory were correct, I wonder how much effect it would have on <br>
cryonic procedures (*none* I suspect), and on upload scanning protocols <br>
(*alot* I suspect).<br>
<p>
If these 'holographic mind' ideas have been *completely* debunked, thanks <br>
for your patience and fire away.<br>
