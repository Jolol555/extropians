<i>&gt; &gt;     The pharmaceutical Corporations, were unable to control Congress</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which recently responded to public pressure and allowed freedom in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; food supplements.  However, they are not so easily defeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in their quest to reap cartel style profits based on "reguations".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;      So, they are going to the World Government institutions to</i><br>

<i>&gt; :: This seems unlikely to me.  Pharmaceutical companies can sell</i><br>
<i>&gt; :: vitamins at a profit like any other product.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; to which James responds:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   They get higher profits for a longer period when their products</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    fall under regulations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; They might get higher profits per unit, but the volume of sales</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be much less.  What if a product (such as anabolic steroids)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is taken off the market altogether?  Would you say this is a plot by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; pharmaceutical companies to increase their profits?</i><br>
<p>
	Yeah sure!  I would say that whatever happens, it is a conspiracy.<br>
Please, let's not waste time with stupid questions.<br>
<p>
	Monopolies tend to raise prices and contract production to<br>
increase profits.  Obviously, this can go too far and result in decreased<br>
profits if volume contracts too much.  There is obviously a profit<br>
optimizing point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not even clear that the profit per unit would be higher if vitamins</i><br>
<i>&gt; were prescription drugs.  Nobody has a patent on vitamins.   Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; doctors would prescribe the cheapest generic vitamins they could find.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is exactly the kind of situation pharmaceutical companies want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; avoid.   They can make a lot more money selling vitamins over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; counter than they would make selling them by prescription.</i><br>
<p>
	Your last sentence does not follow as it is another very<br>
competitive situation pharmaceutical companies would like to avoid.<br>
<p>
	What you are missing is the problem of uncertainty in a free<br>
market competitive situation.  When availabilty of capital is the only<br>
barrier to market entry by newcomers, the existing producers are<br>
vulnerable to business failure, not just low profits.  A poorly conceived<br>
new entry might drive the whole industry toward bankruptcy or a new entry<br>
with fantastic new production methods might drive out existing producers.<br>
Also, vicious price wars might develop among existing producers leading to<br>
bankruptcies.<br>
<p>
	Established producers see regulatory systems, covertly controlled<br>
more or less by themselves, as insurance against these risks.  The<br>
established producers can generally see to it that newcomers are given an<br>
especially "hard way to go" by the regulators when they attempt to enter<br>
the market.  There is no reason to think regulations will be enforced<br>
objectively, none whatsoever.  Regulators are easily subverted into<br>
picking winners and losers instead of confining themselves to objective<br>
regulation!  See saccharine vs aspertame for example.<br>
<p>
	Anyone think it odd that Value Jet was shut down when it had a<br>
crash while established firms suffer little or no scrutiny when they have<br>
a crash?  Just one little example.<br>
<p>
[snip]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Clearly, all producers, unless morally restrained, look for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pretext under which to have the govt cartelize their industry, limiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; competition, and thereby prolonging profits.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All producers?  I don't think so.  Some companies make a profit by</i><br>
<i>&gt; differentiating their product from others, and creating a perception of</i><br>
<i>&gt; uniqueness.</i><br>
<p>
	Yeah, but they would do even better if they could set up a cartel<br>
to prevent or reduce the number of people doing similar things....other<br>
people differentiating their products could be defined as frauds!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What is so incredible about compromising high level pubpols</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and finpols with child sex, drugs, etc?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This in itself is not incredible.  I don't doubt that such things happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I think you overstate your case, and hurt your credibility by</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing so.  I also think you try to explain too much with one principle</i><br>
<i>&gt; (conspiracy), instead of considering other explanations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you familiar at all with the results of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 70's Congressional probes into the CIA?  MKULTRA?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No.  And I think this is leading us pretty far afield.</i><br>
<p>
	You brought-up CIA mind control to discredit me and now you admit<br>
you know nothing about the basic evidence for it revealed by Congressional<br>
Committees decades ago!  Much of what Extropians want to do is being<br>
studied intensively by the CIA and Pentagon black budgets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think we should be looking in another direction for an explanation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it is a matter of belief systems, not profits.  There are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite a few doctors who *believe* (to use Rich's favorite word) that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is superstitious, immoral, WRONG to take vitamins.  I want to know</i><br>
<i>&gt; where that belief comes from, and what if anything we can do about it.</i><br>
<p>
	Apparently, you don't really want to know that "political<br>
correctness" is engineered by those who benefit.  Look at what the<br>
Rockefeller Brothers Fund finances....everything Extropians and<br>
Libertarians oppose!  Just a coincidence?  The existing ruling class is<br>
primarily devoted to memetic engineering!  Developing belief systems<br>
beneficial to themselves!  Study what the great Foundations are up to...<br>
What is the mass media up to...<br>

<i>&gt; :: the UN, Nafta, and GATT are irrelevant to this particular point.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; to which James replied</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Now this is really total ignorance.  The whole purpose of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; World Trade Organization is to make product regulations uniform</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worldwide.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Excuse me, but this is a non sequitur.  The WTO could just as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; make a uniform world-wide rule that vitamins shall be sold over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; counter.  The fact that they are trying to make uniform rules is irrelevant</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the question of why they come down on that side of the issue --</i><br>
<i>&gt; and also irrelevant to the question of why vitamins are an issue at all.</i><br>
<p>
	The rules they are already working on will drastically restrict<br>
vitamins....why do you suppose the great corporations are promoting GATT<br>
and NAFTA and WTO?  So vitamins can be sold over the counter...?  So<br>
consumers will benefit?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why do some people take it upon themselves to restrict our access to</i><br>
<i>&gt; vitamins and other health-promoting substances?  It seems absurd, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; there must be a cause.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe that's a sacred cow -- I always assume that there is a cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; for whatever happens.  More precisely, I assume that the best way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to proceed in most situations is to look for causes.  This is something</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I don't think I would be willing to question.</i><br>
<p>
	Well, we certainly agree on this point.  I suspect you need to<br>
read a bit more business history.  Business and industry seeks to build<br>
cartels at every opportunity, as Adam Smith noted.  I have no objection to<br>
voluntary ones as they are fleeting in the face of the market, but via<br>
control of government big business systematically forms informal, covert<br>
cartels.<br>
<p>
	Fortunately, their control over government, though more effective<br>
than that of anyone else, is imperfect.<br>
