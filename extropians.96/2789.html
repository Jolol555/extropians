<p>
This strikes me as the key to the debate, and to others I've read on this<br>
list.  Various posters have denounced measures grounded in tenets of<br>
mutuality by gesturing to the horrid consequences: you build your house,<br>
say, and all the other lazy bastards take it from you, announcing that their<br>
need is as great as yours and since their numbers are greater than yours<br>
they win the moral right of use.  <br>
<p>
I've never grasped why anyone thinks people are likely to behave this way as<br>
a rule.  Yes, small embittered cohorts that have been excluded from the<br>
benefits of an industrial culture - let us say out of  a history of bigoted<br>
racism - surely do wave guns and menace their neighbors, destroy their<br>
brains with intoxicants that numb their despair, lose the habits of<br>
sociality (but not necessarily of honor and respect, in a narrow sense based<br>
on balance of immediate terror).  <br>
<p>
I find it interesting that this construction of others as malevolent, lazy,<br>
stupid (or rat-cunning) tends to be more wide-spread in societies where<br>
extremes of capitalism *or* state socialism have taken hold.  In many<br>
European countries, and Canada and Australia, where a shifting blend of<br>
these approaches operates, there is less street violence, far less<br>
polarisation of rich and poor and hence of envy and fear (although that is<br>
changing, and I exclude the usual brutal marginalisation of indigenes in the<br>
latter two nations).  <br>
<p>
In general, I expect people to help each other unless there is an<br>
overwhelming motive for not doing so.  Unlike most people on the net, I'm a<br>
complete klutz with computers - and would not be here, were it not for<br>
various people who simply chose to be generous and help me out.  In return,<br>
but not with any strict accounting being recorded, I do what I can to help<br>
other people in areas that pertain to my skills.  <br>
As a science fiction writer, all my adult life I've been part of a global<br>
(if Anglo-centric) community of people called sf fans whose entire<br>
weltanschaaung is based on what amounts to potlatching.  As less and less<br>
jobs remain in a rapidly approaching (AI- and nano-modified) future, this<br>
seems to me the pattern for decent human relationships.  We might not always<br>
be able to love each other, but we certainly won't get far if we assume that<br>
everyone else is out to scam our hard-won goodies.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;While government today hoards it's knowledge and says "we know what's</i><br>
<i>&gt;best", a democratic system depends on everybody having access to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information. I don't think the consumers will vote for cheaper products if</i><br>
<i>&gt;they realize that the workers can't afford to feed themselves as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;result. </i><br>
<p>
Having registered my own pious plea, above, I now have to say that Suresh's<br>
hope is empirically doubtful.  In my country, most consumers have achieved a<br>
much more pleasant standard of living by importing huge amounts of very<br>
cheap consumables from the sweatshops of south Asia, thereby effectively<br>
wiping out the small industries that used to produce clothing, light<br>
electrical goods, etc.  In the long run, of course, nanofacturing will do<br>
this on a mammoth scale - but with any luck the goodies flowing from the<br>
cornucopia machine will be *so* cheap that everyone will gain by their<br>
existence.  Right now, the inner city industrial suburb where I live is full<br>
of empty factories, and 30 percent of the kids who once would have had a<br>
fairly nasty life working in them are cooling their heels at home all day<br>
long, on the dole but chafing for a meaningful life.  But the consumers (at<br>
least 50 percent of them, since voting is compulsory and therefore universal<br>
in Australia) keep voting in the pollies who ordain the `level playing<br>
field' doctrines responsible for the ruin of their neighbors.  <br>
