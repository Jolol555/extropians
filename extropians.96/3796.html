<i>&gt;Now let me criticize Brin.  In his 12/96 Wired article Brin is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently clear about what our choices are, nor does he</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently defend his claims about choices.  Brin says that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;inevitable that most of us will be viewed by cameras while we walk</i><br>
<i>&gt;about in public, and "the proliferation of vast databases ... about</i><br>
<i>&gt;our lives, habits, tastes, and personal histories."</i><br>
<p>
I agree that cameras are going to be everywhere and I don't think it's all<br>
that bad either as long as they're not in the home. Cameras in public<br>
should and are owned by multiple multiple companies many of which are<br>
competing against each other preventing huge centralized databases from<br>
forming. Sure, some of the information will be sold, but no one can access<br>
all of it and will increasingly so as gov't breaks down and decentralizes<br>
further along with the IRS centralized database which will hopefully become<br>
corrupt in 2000 which makes the *perfect* opportunity to be rid of it once<br>
and for all. What are your opinions on the franchised gov't theories in<br>
Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash? Islands of gov't all over with pure anarchy<br>
(ultimate freedom) in the cracks between.<br>
