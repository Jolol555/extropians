<i>&gt;Many religions have been propagated through force of the sword.  In many</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases this proved to be an effective technique.  If religion is such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;profoundly intertwined aspect of a person's being, how were so many</i><br>
<i>&gt;countries and regions "converted" permanently and effectively simply by</i><br>
<i>&gt;force, even if occupation was relatively transient?  This seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;inconsistent with the supposed nature of religion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Look in your Psych 101 book (I recommend Zimbardo and Gerrig, _Psychology<br>
and Life_, if you don't have one) under "cognitive dissonance" and<br>
"dissonance reduction".  Psych experts please pardon the oversimplification,<br>
but:  being placed in a situation about which they have a bad attitude but<br>
over which they have no control creates cognitive dissonance in people, and<br>
to reduce it they tend to change their attitudes (since they can't change<br>
the situation).<br>
<p>
How often have you heard "It's not so bad once you get used to it."?<br>
And I imagine that if there are small children involved, the conversion<br>
is effectively complete as soon as they are brainwashed (frighteningly<br>
easy) and old enough to be role models for younger siblings.  And<br>
the parents get a double motivator for dissonance reduction because<br>
they want to protect the children (a number of untoward things could<br>
happen to a family whose child said to the wrong member of the<br>
conquering force, "My mom says your religion is *evil*!").<br>
<p>
Yes, some manage to escape, hide, dissemble, etc.  I'm talking about<br>
most people, who even if they have resources to do so don't know they do.<br>
<p>
Scary stuff,<br>
