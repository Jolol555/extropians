It's true that the very first assembler will not be very capable.<br>
However it differs from the very first computer in one essential<br>
way: the first computer was not useful in the fabrication of the<br>
second computer. This is the "sudden change." The trial and error<br>
to which you refer can therefore be accompished much quicker.<br>
