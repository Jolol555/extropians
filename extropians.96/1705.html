I'm not sure about which claim is being made either.<br>

<p>
Unfortunately, when there are several kinds of costs, growth rates<br>
tend to be determined by the slowest growth rate among the different<br>
costs.  The amazing thing about historical growth rates is that we<br>
have been able reduce pretty much *all* kinds of costs at a similar<br>
rate.  So for computer growth rates to determine economic growth<br>
rates, computers would have to be the main costs behind pretty much<br>
everything.   Possible in theory, but unlikely before uploads or AIs,<br>
IMHO. <br>
