On Saturday, September 28, 1996 6:27AM Dr. Rich Artym said (to Lyle):<br>
"You can argue MNTwith others;  as an engineer, I'm more interested in<br>
*making* it happen."<br>
<p>
Then, on Saturday, September 28, 1996 5:01PM Dr. Rich Artym asked:<br>
"I wonder though, is there anyone else on the list besides Lyle that<br>
doesn't believe that MNT will achieve the bulk of the things that are<br>
being predicted for it?  It would be good to know --- it might save us<br>
time and effort in wasted arguments."<br>
<p>
I think the majority would agree (or at least like to believe) that<br>
strong nanotech capabilities will _eventually_ be achieved.  But I can<br>
recall at least two others besides myself who posted concerns about your<br>
vision of how we can get there from here and what shape it might<br>
ultimately take.<br>
<p>
As an engineer, and a software one at that, I would think you'd<br>
recognize the need for calibration and specification that Lyle suggests,<br>
as well as the practicality of incremental development.  Too many<br>
'grand-scheme' or 'master-plan' software development efforts have<br>
crashed &amp; burned.  *In the case of nanotech, the consequences could be<br>
alot more severe than just some money down the drain.*<br>
<p>
IMHO, the scenarios you've suggested would be feasible only for some<br>
stripped-down, 'virtual nanotechnology' simulated in an Artificial<br>
Reality, OR in a world where nanites were already in control of<br>
everything - "an organic/silico blob" / "a teaming, feasting soup" as<br>
some posts on older threads envisioned.  That day may come; but, if<br>
you're really "more interested in *making* it happen", you should be<br>
working on a practical transition plan.<br>
