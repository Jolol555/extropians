As a parent with two school-age children (showing my age), I find this<br>
quote disturbingly familiar.  The idea there are no black and white facts<br>
-- or that facts just clutter your mind -- is extremely popular these days<br>
among educationists.<br>
<p>
The world is filled with black and white facts.  They really are facts, and<br>
they really are 100% true.  To deny this is a sign of mental laziness,<br>
because facts must be studied, remembered, and understood.  Saying<br>
everything falls into a grey area saves yourself a lot of work and makes it<br>
impossible for anyone to test your knowledge -- because there is nothing to<br>
pin down.<br>
<p>
Here in the People's Republic of Wilmette (Illinois) we constantly hear<br>
about the evils of "rigid facts" and "rote memorization" from public school<br>
teachers.  Meanwhile, our kids are not being taught to spell, they are not<br>
being taught basic math tables ...and business at Sylvan Learning Centers<br>
is booming.  Meanwhile, our teachers claim they are teaching our children<br>
"how to think" -- not just filling their minds with contextless<br>
information.  But from what I have seen, "how to think" means "what to<br>
think."  There is so much political indoctrination going on, I must spend<br>
considerable time debriefing my children.<br>
<p>
Yes, there are "grey areas."  Mostly, I think this is because either we<br>
haven't yet ascertained the facts, or you are discussing a complex issue<br>
for which no one fact is dominant.<br>
<p>
Throw out "black and white facts," and you throw out concrete knowledge.<br>
