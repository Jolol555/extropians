<i>&gt; So, something that would go a long way towards getting government</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of our lives and our wallets would be the formation of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies which provided for people all of the services which</i><br>
<i>&gt; government tries to provide, but does it cheaper and better than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government does.  Libertarians have been talking about privatizing for</i><br>
<i>&gt; years now, and there already exist private companies which perform</i><br>
<i>&gt; basically the same services that government attempts to do.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; private schools, private drug testing companies, Consumer Reports and</i><br>
<i>&gt; so forth.  But people still want the government to provide these</i><br>
<i>&gt; services.  Why?</i><br>
<p>
Because no government AFAIK has ever said "find an alternative supplier<br>
for the services we provide and we will reduce your taxes accordingly."<br>
Even the hard-right, allegedly Capitalist governments are shown to be<br>
basically coercive socialists as soon as state taxes are threatened.<br>
<p>
Belief that Republicans or Thatcherites are free-market Capitalists is<br>
about as well-founded as belief in flying pigs.  Politics and freedom<br>
are practically mutually exclusive, in the sense that politicians are<br>
more or less by definition in the business of regulation, which is the<br>
denial of freedom and emergent order.<br>
