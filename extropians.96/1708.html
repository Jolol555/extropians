That's what the general public got from it, but is that really all<br>
Shelley meant to convey?  Frankenstein did create a rational,<br>
intelligent human being, except for size and stamina.  The nutcase<br>
running around is Frankenstein himself.  "Too ugly!  Too ugly!"  The<br>
'monster' goes bad out of loneliness and spite.  But that is so obvious<br>
if you read the book that I have trouble imagining Mary Shelley wasn't<br>
aware of that.<br>
<p>
Actually the general public didn't get anything from the book, because<br>
the general public hasn't read the book.  The general public saw bad<br>
movies loosely inspired by the book.  Personally, if we ever start<br>
suppressing technology I nominate audio-visual mass media.  Make people<br>
read.<br>
