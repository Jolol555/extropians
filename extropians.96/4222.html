     I came into this late because I just returned from the A4M meeting in Las<br>
Vegas, so I may have missed this having already discussed. Like Kennita, I have<br>
always found chain letters to be very distasteful and have been very scornful<br>
of anyone who propagates them. However, upon reflection, I don't see anything<br>
wrong with chain letters so long as they aren't related to some pyramid-type or<br>
other zero-sum money making scheme. After all, are they not just a kind of<br>
formalized and very direct method of propagation of memes? In that sense, how<br>
do they really differ from the normal mouth-to-mouth, person-to-person<br>
propagation of any ideas which we all are quite happy with? Only for the money-<br>
making, get rich not by producing any value but by relying on the gullibility<br>
of others meme, do I consider them to be "wrong". In fact, I would assume that<br>
the very ones Sean finds interesting to study must have *some* valid or<br>
persuasive meme or they wouldn't be working. Of course, it is true that such a<br>
meme may only have value in appealing to, and resonating with the negative<br>
qualities of individuals. Certainly, I agree that I have never seen a chain<br>
letter that I have wanted to propagate, and I have never used such a method to<br>
propagate any memes which I originated.<br>
<p>
     Just thought about the possibilities and came up with the following idea.<br>
How about *using* the chain letter approach to reward people for propagating an<br>
important idea or other piece of information which we find highly valuable to<br>
spread (say, my Prometheus Project information). It would work this way. I<br>
start the letter which contains the information which I which to propagate and<br>
at the bottom states, that if you cross off the first name on the list, add<br>
your own to the bottom, and send me the name that was at the top of the list. I<br>
will pay that person (say between $0.50 and $1.00) for each time that I receive<br>
his name. Apart from the fact that most people (especially the ones that I<br>
would want to attract) are *so* against chain letters that they would not even<br>
begin to read it (unless they don't realize until the end that it is a chain<br>
letter), what do readers think of this idea?<br>
