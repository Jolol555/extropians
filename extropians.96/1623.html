Time is always important in aesthetics (fashion).  Something maybe <br>
absolutely beautiful one moment, but after a while the mind <br>
seeks newer beauty.   <br>
<p>

<p>
It will evolve forever.  The art has an impact on the observer, <br>
which changes that observer and leaves them to find more.  Kinda <br>
like the Borg assimilating more novelty...<br>
