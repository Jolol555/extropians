<i>&gt;Coming back to the cell.  A cruder form of this -- a sharpened rock  -- </i><br>
<i>&gt;would be to design a protein that absorbs the vibrations of an adjacent </i><br>
<i>&gt;protein in such a way as to calm it down, so to speak.  To damp out </i><br>
<i>&gt;its vibrations.  To cancel its noise.  That would have the effect of </i><br>
<i>&gt;cooling it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is basically a physics problem.  The fact that the vibrating </i><br>
<i>&gt;structures are proteins doesn't really enter into it.  How does one design </i><br>
<i>&gt;a vibrating structure that absorbs and damps out the vibrations of an </i><br>
<i>&gt;adjacent structure?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
There is a type of "active" composite that has the properties you are<br>
describing.  It is a laminate composite consisting of piezo-electric<br>
ceramics  and shape-memory alloys from the nickel-titanium family.  <br>
<p>
When vibrations hit the ceramic outer laminate, the ceramic acts as a<br>
transducer, converting the vibration into an electrical signal.  The signal<br>
is inverted (It may be inverted via an anisotropic material property.  I am<br>
not sure.) and fed into the shape-memory alloy.  The alloy flexes and<br>
reproduces the inverted signal, similar to a speaker, through the ceramic.<br>
<p>
The net effect is that the material nulls the vibration, but produces heat<br>
with the excess energy.  This composite is being considered for use as a<br>
solid state vibration damping mechanism in macro structures such as aircraft<br>
wings and sensitive machinery.  I understand it is extremely effective.<br>
<p>
A more advanced version of this technology is being studied for next<br>
generation submarine stealth technologies.  Preliminary tests indicate that<br>
it is possible to make a submarine invisible to active sonar in this way.<br>
