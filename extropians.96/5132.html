Agreed. This certainly happens, and all the introductory crypto <br>
literature is riddled with remarks that one should not mess with a given <br>
algorithm, trying to "improve" it (apart from developing an algorithm from <br>
scratch, while having zero cryptoanalytical experience), but I was trying to <br>
sell something else.<br>
<p>
Clearly, a huge algorithm which is trivial to break can exist. However, <br>
I was trying to argument about a clear-cut algorithm family, with several <br>
parameters, and an easy way to benchmark them, both in theory and <br>
practice. I've looked up IDEA, and indeed, it does not contain lookup <br>
tables, while DES, GOST, Blowfish, etc. do. Little wonder, as IDEA <br>
substitutes opaque tables with magical code.<br>
<p>
Consider a hypothetical computer, with code being about as succinct as an <br>
average modern machine. Clearly, encryption cannot be done by a program <br>
consisting of one instruction. Otoh a program the size of the entire <br>
physical memory consisting of NOPs won't accomplish much, as well. A space <br>
of all possible programs of given length will contain duds as well as <br>
brilliant algorithms. The longer the program, the larger the space, the <br>
more the absolute number of brilliant algorithms. A brilliant algorithm <br>
can use opaque code with little data, or tiny code with a lot of magic <br>
cookies in tables -- I'd say both can provide equally good encryption. <br>
But while data can be created by a physical methods/automatisms, code <br>
currently cannot. Data can be changed in the course of system evolution, <br>
while code currently cannot, both SMC being a strong no-no, and the code <br>
brittleness preventing this. So cryptosystems with opaque tables should win.<br>
<p>
What does it mean, if the data encoding the Hamiltonian is changed during <br>
the system evolution? It can be thought executing a walk in the space of <br>
possible Hamiltonians, or being a Hamiltonian of a higher order. I <br>
conjecture it makes it much harder to break, as SMC is typically mightier <br>
than plain code, albeit banned (but due to its complexity!).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In the German "Enigma", they added a little "improvement" which made it</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible for any letter to be encoded as itself.  That, essentially,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is how the Allies cracked it.</i><br>
<p>
It was a bit more complicated than that. In the excellent book by Andrew <br>
Hodges "Alan Turing -- the enigma" the life and works of this, sadly, <br>
little-known scientist, is described nicely. (Hint: Andrew Hodges has <br>
created a web site, as well).<br>
