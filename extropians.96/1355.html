Wow! I was almost ready to agree with your post 100% (in which case this<br>
would have just been a "me too" post) until I got down to the last clause.<br>
I think it's important to acknowledge that introspection can be just as<br>
fallible as our other sensory modalities. This isn't *very* fallible (I<br>
think natural selection has provided human beings with a finely honed set<br>
of sensorics), but it is fallible to some extent. And probably there has<br>
been a lot less selection pressure to improve the accuracy of our<br>
introspections than there has been to improve the accuracy of our vision,<br>
hearing, ability to sense heat and cold, etc. For this reason, I'd even go<br>
so far as to say that our introspective senses are probably more fallible<br>
than our "extrospective" senses.<br>
<p>
I've more than once had the experience of being told that I was angry, of<br>
vigorously denying that I was angry, and then of realizing (from listening<br>
to tone of my voice in my vigorous denials) that the other person was<br>
right. Accuracy of perception seems to be related to focus of attention,<br>
and most of us keep our attention focused on the external world most of the<br>
time, for good reason.<br>
<p>
That last clause in your post reintroduces the whole subjective/objective<br>
dichotomy that you spent most of your post demolishing. By asserting that<br>
we are more certain in our knowledge of our personal subjective worlds than<br>
we are in our knowledge of "objective reality", you make the dichotomy<br>
meaningful again. But quite frankly, I think the reliability of my<br>
knowledge of my internal psychological states is no better and no worse<br>
than the reliability of my knowledge of the external world. (In both cases,<br>
my knowledge is reliable enough for my purposes so far.) But both kinds of<br>
knowledge can be improved: we shouldn't take either kind for granted.<br>
