 Experiment #1.  Retracing the Chain of Association <br>
<p>
The first step is to follow a thread on the list backward, and see <br>
where it came from.  For example, this afternoon there were posts <br>
about Prozac.  That came from a discussion of psychedelics, <br>
which came from a discussion of test scores, which came from a <br>
discussion of what kind of causality is presupposed by memetic <br>
engineering.  (The answer, incidentally, is top-down causality.)  <br>
<p>
Try this with aother thread.  Trace it back a few steps -- as many steps <br>
as you can.  You will find that threads shift from one topic to another, <br>
sometimes in a logical way, sometimes in an off-the-wall way.  <br>
<p>
Now, your thoughts are like that too.  Try sitting quietly, or lying in bed <br>
before you go to sleep, and retrace your thoughts.  Think about things <br>
for awhile --- daydream -- and then stop at a certain point, and ask <br>
yourself:  where did this thought come from?  Remember the last thing <br>
you were thinking about before.  Note the train of association that led <br>
from one thought to the next.  Go back and forth a few times between <br>
thought 0 (the starting point, Prozac in the above example) and thought <br>
minus 1 (the previous thought, psychedelics in the above example).  <br>
<p>
Then, if you can, remember the previous thought, thought minus 2.  <br>
Again, note what kind of transition led to the following thought.   <br>
Go back and forth a few times, from thought minus 2 to minus 1, <br>
and then to 0; and then back to -1, and then back to -2.    <br>
<p>
With practice you can trace thoughts back many levels.  It's like a <br>
video game -- going back 15 thoughts is like reaching the 15th screen.  <br>
It can be done, but not easily.  <br>
<p>
