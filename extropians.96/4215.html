At work there are desktop computers in every room all linked via ethernet.<br>
Unforunately someone else is usually using them. :-) Even if I pull rank<br>
and get accessI cause them to shift gears which, as discussed elsewhere in<br>
this thread, is undesirable for them. And since, as a manager, everyone's<br>
productivity (including my own) is my responsibility, I must acknowledge it<br>
is undesirable for the group as well.<br>

The yearly refill is $20 and requires no batteries. It doesn't fit in my<br>
pocket but is bulk makes it less likely to be misplaced. But when it DOES,<br>
everyone knows whose it is and its less likely that someone else might want<br>
to keep it. It can also be used anytime anywhere.<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I love techno gear as much as anyone, but high tech<br>
isn't always better. I was discussing the 'net and the Web with a decidedly<br>
non-technical friend the other day. Her argument was "I don't want to<br>
browse anything sitting at a desk. I want to lay on the sofa with a catalog<br>
or magazine or paperback scrunched in my fist." I described heads-up<br>
displays the size of reading galsses and the Library of Congress on a<br>
credit card. She said "Cool, let me know when that's ready. Until then I'll<br>
stick to printed stuff."<br>
<p>
The next day she called and asked if I could find some herbal medicine info<br>
on "that Web thing." I was online at the time so I did a few searches while<br>
we were on the phone. She was suitably impressed and now wants to try it out.<br>
<p>
I guess the point of that digression is "the right tool for the job." And<br>
right has as much to do with the user as the job. <br>
<p>
For me, the way I work and what I need to do, the paper based planner is<br>
the right tool. YMMV<br>
