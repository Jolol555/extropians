IAN: In fact the rock was first identifed as being terrestrial. The <br>
following information, if true, renders the rock * highly suspect.*<br>

Subject: Mars Life Announcement Fraud Issue<br>

David McKay, the NASA JSC scientist who recently announced the<br>
discovery of evidence of life on Mars, has a history of alleged<br>
scientific fraud. <br>
<p>
These allegations arise out of his tenure as director of an Aug. 1984<br>
NASA Summer Study held in La Jolla on the use of extraterrestrial<br>
resources for building missile defenses. <br>
<p>
At the end of the study McKay held a press conference in which<br>
ex-astronaut Buzz Aldrin, (who had participated in the summer study<br>
for only one day) announced that the approximately 20 college<br>
professors who had participated for the entire duration of this study<br>
had recommended building a lunar base and mining the moon to build<br>
missile defenses.  But in reality the professors had voted unanimously<br>
*3 times* against recommending the building of a lunar base. <br>
<p>
In Oct. 1985, at a major conference on the use of extraterrestrial<br>
resources held in Washington DC, McKay put out a press release<br>
accompanied by a putative final report of that summer study with the<br>
names of the professors given as the alleged authors. This phony<br>
report included the slogan "On to the Moon!" It claimed the professors<br>
in this summer study had recommended building a lunar base. <br>
<p>
You can read more details of this episode of McKay's scientific fraud<br>
in pages 345-7 in the book "Space Resources:  Breaking the Bonds of<br>
Earth,"  by John S. Lewis and Ruth Lewis, Columbia University Press,<br>
New York, 1987.  Lewis was one of the professors who took part in that<br>
summer study.  <br>
<p>
Judging by the fact that McKay is still an employee of NASA JSC, fraud<br>
must not be a career liability over there. <br>
<p>
Fraud. It is a dagger in the heart of science, especially when there<br>
is only one small rock on which to base a claim that could touch off<br>
the Copernican Revolution of biology. And especially when that<br>
discovery would be so convenient for McKay and NASA.<br>
