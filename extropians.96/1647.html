I think it can be created now, from a technical standpoint. But it might <br>
be harder to do something truly artistic with it. <br>
<p>
One idea I have toyed with is to link a viewer (or preferably many <br>
viewers) to the system with EEG, and show pictures generated using <br>
genetic algorithms to them. Pictures that produce much alpha-waves <br>
reproduce better and mutate, hopefully leading to pictures that are <br>
relaxing and interesting (one could of course look at many applications, <br>
including stimulating or truly awful pictures). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can something evolve and</i><br>
<i>&gt; become more attractive forever or is their a hard limit on how attractive</i><br>
<i>&gt; something can be?</i><br>
<p>
Attractiveness is subjective and probably changes from second to second - <br>
right now I would not be very interested in a gourmet dish (I've got a <br>
cold) which I otherwise would have savored. In the same way, one could <br>
probably produce something that was close to optimum in delight only if <br>
one could monitor exactly what the viewer found delightful in realtime, <br>
and that is hard. My guess is that it is possible to get close, but then <br>
the art object would move into a strange attractor. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And if there is a hard limit what would be it's reaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; on you? Incapacitating?</i><br>
<p>
Reminds me of Tipler's rather silly calculation of the psychological<br>
impact of the ideal partner in (the omega-created) paradise. This partner<br>
would be the global optimum of all partners, and would have around 100,000<br>
times more impact than the most beautiful *existing* person in the world.<br>
Tipler dryly points out that our nervous system probably won't take such<br>
beauty and charm, but we would of course be able to extend it to handle<br>
such rapture... <br>
