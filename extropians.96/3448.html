<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Awhile ago I begand compiling a list of outdated words which not only did not</i><br>
<i>&gt;CORRESPOND to our day to day life, but perhaps were detrimental, or ENTROPIC.</i><br>
<i>&gt;At the very least undermining  advancment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One good example is the use of SUNRISE, and SUNSET&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyone have any good ones to add to this lexicon of loser linguistics?</i><br>
<p>
Sorry if sunrise and sunset don't correspond to your daily life.  I tried<br>
to make them widely accessible.  If you want to return the phenomena (the<br>
subjective experiences of a sun's seeming to rise and set) and their names<br>
for a refund, I can use them (they're a couple of my favorites, actually).<br>
If you change your mind later, you can rent them from me.  My rates will be<br>
reasonable, but not as low as you were paying.  I must warn you that the<br>
experiences won't be quite the same as when they were free, especially<br>
after you've disowned them and tarnished their names ("loser linguistics").<br>
<p>
Which reminds me that "loser" is a word whose utility I've been wondering<br>
about lately.<br>
<p>
Yours,<br>
