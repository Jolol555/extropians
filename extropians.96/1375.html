<p>
<p>
IAN: Here's some really good reasons to believe they are cover ups:<br>
<p>
        OKLAHOMA BOMBING COVER UP <br>
<p>
        1. I don't know what you call a cover up, but the FBI <br>
        kept private investigators out of the Murrha building<br>
        in OK City, then quickly blew it up and within a few<br>
        days had all the remains -- still viable evidence -- <br>
        buried at the BFI Waste Systems land fill. To make<br>
        sure it didn't look like a cover-up, they erected a<br>
        fence around the landfill and posted armed guards<br>
        who prevented all private investigators from even <br>
        entering the site. This is a cover up ipso facto.<br>
<p>
<p>
        2. Fabrication of evidence is a cover up of the <br>
        truth. Associated Press 04/10/96 (emphasis added):<br>
<p>
            Prosecutors agreed to turn over letters <br>
            from FBI agent Frederic Whitehurts, who <br>
            tested Mr. McVeigh's cloths for traces <br>
            of explosives. Mr. Whitehurst has claimed <br>
            that investigators FAKED evidence in the <br>
            bombing case.      ^^^^^ <br>
<p>
        Right there, cover up -- an investigator comes<br>
        forward and admits it. Now Mr. Whitehurst fears<br>
        intimidation for his "spilling of the beans." Did<br>
        you hear much about this in the media? There are<br>
        at least a dozen other examples in this case alone.<br>
<p>
<p>
        COCAINE / CONTRA COVER UP<br>
<p>
        Associated Press, 09/23/96<br>
<p>
        ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Activist Dick Gregory <br>
        and two others were arrested Monday in a protest <br>
        at the Drug Enforcement Administration after <br>
        demanding release of information on when the <br>
        agency first learned of allegations that U.S.<br>
        -backed Nicaraguan rebels were shipping <br>
        cocaine to the United States. <br>
<p>
        They were joined at the protest by former DEA <br>
        agent Celerino Castillo III, who said he filed <br>
        reports documenting how in the mid-1980s, the <br>
        U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras were raising<br>
        money buy funneling crack cocaine to inner- <br>
        city gangs in Los Angeles. <br>
<p>
 ---&gt;   Castillo sought, without success, release of <br>
        his own investigative files on the matter....<br>
        despite reports from Castillo and others, the <br>
        government did nothing to stop the alleged <br>
        drug-running. <br>
        <br>
One could fill books with evidence/proof of govt cover up. Hell, govt<br>
is one solid cover up of the fact that central planning is a constant <br>
failure, yet they conspire [not that word] everyday to force more and <br>
more of it down our throats.  This should be known to all extropians.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>  &gt;I'm proud to say that I'm reading nothing but science books.  </i><br>
<i>  &gt; Because of my interest in science, I have a lot of trouble </i><br>
<i>  &gt; with the sort of 'evidence' generally cited in support of </i><br>
<i>  &gt; conspiracy theories.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: If your reading no evidence about govt conspiracy -- the not<br>
doing of which you claim to be proud of -- then how can you in the <br>
same breath reject this evidence you proudly ignore ???  Is such <br>
a priori rejection of evidence what they teach in science books ?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>  &gt; There's not much point in owning myself if I'm not worth much.  </i><br>
<i>  &gt; Most of my feelings of self-worth are based on an awareness that </i><br>
<i>  &gt; I try to think clearly, rationally, and skeptically.  I see no </i><br>
<i>  &gt; point at all in fantasizing 'enemies' just to make the prospect </i><br>
<i>  &gt; of self-ownership seem more precious.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Fear if illness and disease is a logical basis for valuation of <br>
health.  There are diseases out there that "want" to get us.  So to,<br>
there are tyrants out there that want your freedom, wealth and labor.<br>
You'd be wise to fear them and foolish to ignore them. Because enough <br>
people ignore the available evidence / proof of  govt cover up and <br>
atrocity, they will be slowly divested of more and more of both <br>
their  liberties and  properties even as these govt funded <br>
acts of atrocity form the very pretext for such loses.<br>
