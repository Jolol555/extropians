When the prospect of Nanotechnology finely starts to show up on even the  <br>
thickest politician's Radar screen (in other words when it's almost here) <br>
I have no doubt they will pass a gaggle of laws to try to regulate it. I also  <br>
have no doubt that those laws will be about as effective as our current <br>
anti drug laws. All it would take is for somebody to smuggle out something <br>
smaller than a grain of sand and the ball game would be over. You could do <br>
even less, just encrypt the information, use Steganography to hide the message <br>
in the video of the 3D version of Rocky 17 or Rambo 14 and send it off into <br>
the internet. There is no way Big Brother could even tell there was a message <br>
hidden there, much less know what it said.<br>
 <br>
Restricting research on Nanotechnology would not work either. Unlike nuclear <br>
Physics you don't need huge machines to study it, you don't need enormous <br>
factories that easily show up on satellite photos to manufacture the critical   <br>
ingredients for it, you could do it all in your kitchen, or a matchbox for <br>
that matter. Also, governments would be afraid to ignore Nanotechnology for <br>
fear that somebody else will find it first.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I find it hard to see any other way to forestall the Fermi                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Paradox.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
If by some miracle a government was able to control Nanotechnology it would <br>
only make things worse. Sooner or later any government will come under the <br>
control of somebody who is insane, if History is any judge it will be sooner  <br>
rather than later, but it will certainly not be long by a Cosmological <br>
standard, and when that happens it will be all over. If things are spread out <br>
and decentralized with is no central authority, then even if most become <br>
suicidal there will always be a few who are not and they can carry on.<br>
<p>
All this is not to say you haven't put your finger on a significant danger, <br>
you most certainly have. If a central government will not ensure a smooth  <br>
transition to the age of Nanotechnology what will?  Damned if I know. <br>
