"If we talk about improving brains by giving them better software, i.e. better <br>

know more."<br>
<p>
I heavily disagree with this.  As we increase the quality of "software" we are <br>
running in our brains, we become more intelligent.  Our intelligence is not <br>
some static quality.  It has very much to do with our existing knowledge and <br>
our ways of thinking about things, and these things can be changed.  Our <br>
intelligence can increase incredibly as we change our ways of thinking and <br>
develop more useful knowledge.  The nature of the "hardware" of our brains is <br>
very important too, but the right "software" can make the difference between a <br>
bumbling moron and a brilliant genius.  <br>
<p>
We all have the ability to increase our intelligence by a tremendous amount by <br>
constantly developing and refining more powerful thinking skills and <br>
knowledge.  I have been doing this for the past few years, and I am several <br>
times more intelligent than I was a few years ago, and my rate of progress <br>
continues to accellerate.  It is because I am constantly revising and refining <br>
my observational and thinking skills.  I am rewriting my own software, and I <br>
am becoming smarter because of it.  It requires a great deal of personal <br>
discipline, but we can make ourselves more intelligent by altering our ways of <br>
thinking and our ways of gathering information.<br>
