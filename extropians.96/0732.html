I don't think the New Deal saved anything.  Socialism in America was killed<br>
off by Stalinists who equated liberalism with fascism until Hitler attacked<br>
the Soviet Union; then they hid their Marxist agenda to better support<br>
their new-found friend, FDR.<br>

Technology is what brought an end to the old boom-bust cycle.  The pace of<br>
economic progress has quickened.  Many more avenues of growth are open.<br>
Networks and PCs have brought more people into the markets, and they can<br>
respond much faster.  Today, every downturn is just a near-term investment<br>
opportunity.<br>
