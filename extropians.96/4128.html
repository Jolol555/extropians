I wrote:<br>
&lt;I don't consider other 'conscious beings' to be *simply* units of <br>
matter and energy for my own consumption and entertainment.&gt;<br>
<p>
The key word there was *simply*.<br>
<p>
Joost asked:<br>
&lt;Does anyone really, ...or doesn't everyone ?&gt;<br>
<p>
Some do, some don't.  That's the distinction between the trader and <br>
the thief.<br>
<p>
&lt;Do you have plants in your house ? Are you not taking away their <br>
right to have a chance to grow out in the open and reproduce, the <br>
chance to flourish unlimited by the boundries of the little pot you <br>
keep them in ? &gt;<br>
<p>
I have occasionally adopted plants that might otherwise have died. <br>
 Some I have successfully transplanted. Others I have left to their <br>
own devices, providing only basic nourishment, and watched them wither <br>
or flourish over time.  (Although I do have one special garden where I <br>
have steadfastly pruned a stand of wild blueberry (Vaccinium) bushes <br>
over many years.  I reap no bounty from this other than altruistic and <br>
aesthetic satisfaction - and skinned hands - as most fruits are left <br>
to the birds.)<br>
<p>
_But_ it is not my duty to care for _all_ plants. Most must survive on <br>
their own.  That would no longer be possible if humans took it upon <br>
themselves to control and cultivate _all_ of creation, as Pearce's <br>
Hedonistic Imperative proposes.<br>
<p>
&lt;So what did you do to 'pay' back your computer today, for having it <br>
serve your 'entertainment' and other purposes ?  Or is a computer not <br>
'conscious' yet ? Or is it the fact that we have created it, which <br>
makes it OK.&gt;<br>
<p>
Computers are _still_ things that 'we' have constructed.  We feed them <br>
electricity (and data) and turn them on.  To date they would have no <br>
existence without us.  I have no problem, however, with computers <br>
eventually becoming intelligent enough to reproduce on their own, to <br>
learn on their own (to have a will of their own?)  (see <br>
<a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/SelfOrganWWW.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/SelfOrganWWW.html</a> ) I might say that <br>
that day has already arrived because no one person 'creates a <br>
computer' - it is the product of a larger organism, the civilization / <br>
ecology that we are part of.<br>
<p>
&lt;Humanity is capable of both creation and helping other species <br>
reproduce. With that comes responsability, i agree. But just like <br>
someone suggested we should not project *ALL* Natural ethics to human <br>
society, we should not project *only* human ethics on nature. <br>
Balancing the two is relevant on both a personal and a social level.&gt;<br>
<p>
Balancing, yes ... Jaron Lanier, for one, has seen an imbalance <br>
between 'pave-it-over' Extropians and Stewards (see <br>
<a href="http://www.well.com/user/jaron/topspin.html">http://www.well.com/user/jaron/topspin.html</a> ).  For the most part, I <br>
think this is a false distinction between conservation and <br>
preservation, between cultivation in general and monoculture in <br>
practice.  I don't see any escape from natural ethics in the long run <br>
and see human ethics as a subset of that (but I haven't really studied <br>
ethics).<br>
<p>
&lt;Regarding only natural ethics it is *wrong* to use animals and plants <br>
for ones entertainment, but it is perfectly ok to consume them. <br>
Regarding only human ethics you would see the opposite.&gt;<br>
<p>
Consuming another creature for its energy destroys that creature as an <br>
independent entity.  On the other hand, I can watch another creature's <br>
actions for my entertainment without that creature even knowing about <br>
it.  However, if I interfere with that creature's freedom to support <br>
my entertainment then, according to my ethics, I should attempt to <br>
maximize its integrity and independence as much as possible (in terms <br>
of Extropian principles, its self-ownership) while interacting with <br>
it.<br>
<p>
&lt;Its up to the individual to work out to what side he or she makes <br>
that balance heave a little...&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes.  That's why I don't like all-encompassing imperatives for how <br>
things *should be* for everyone (as in Pearce's Hedonistic <br>
Imperative).<br>
<p>
As they say at <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/FREEDOM.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/FREEDOM.html</a> :<br>
&lt;The mechanistic worldview saw the laws of nature as something that <br>
uniquely prescribes how events should develop, with indeterminacy <br>
resulting only from our lack of knowledge; contemporary science <br>
regards the laws of nature as only restrictions imposed on a basically <br>
non-deterministic world. It is not an accident that the most general <br>
laws of nature are conservation laws, which do not prescribe how <br>
things must be, but only put certain restrictions on them.&gt;<br>
<p>

(Sorry, busy reading the Principia Cybernetica pages on Metasystem <br>
Transition Theory over the weekend. Maybe someone else can more <br>
specifically address your distinctions between natural and human <br>
ethics...)<br>
<p>
BTW, I love the original 'plant humans' idea of people being able to <br>
photosynthesize.  One of my long-term dreams has been to be able to <br>
sail around the world, always heading for that next exotic isle on the <br>
map, able to _literally_ subsist on surf, wind and sunlight, just <br>
soaking up rays, following the currents, tracking the Weather, Web and <br>
Whither via satellite ... (kybernetes at increasingly higher, not <br>
lower levels).<br>
