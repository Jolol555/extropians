No*.  Mammals have come a long way in 65 million years.  Multicellular<br>
went a long way in possibly 20 million years in the Cambrian explosion.<br>
300 million years separate cool down and the first fossil prokaryotes.<br>
Reproducing once a year gives 300 million generations.  Ideally bacteria<br>
can reproduce in an hour, giving 2.6 trillion generations.  Certainly<br>
bacteria and archaea are more complex than they're usually given credit<br>
for outside of microbiology, but I don't have a problem with their<br>
evolution.  300 million years to get working cells, 3 billion years<br>
expanding the diversity of the prokaryotes, 600 million years of<br>
multicellular life... frankly, evolution often seems damn _slow_ to me&amp;.<br>

*Ok, a fair number of people do find it improbable.  Lots of people find<br>
lots of things improbably.  I don't.<br>

There was some microbe discovered -- probably an archaean -- that<br>
reportedly could withstand maybe 90 times the normal radiation levels.<br>
I don't know the details, like whether it can be active or if this is in<br>
cyst form (cysts are _tough_).  I think the ability was a byproduct of<br>
its mechanisms for withstanding dehydration.<br>
