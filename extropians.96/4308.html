<i>&gt; also some compelling brain research to the effect that there are </i><br>
<i>&gt; some differences in the way each gender processes information, but no</i><br>
<i>&gt; one has yet made a compelling case that these are significant enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; to form a basis for gender roles.</i><br>
<p>
Much as I hate to rain on your little party, there are HUGE differences<br>
between the psychology of the two genders, resulting from their<br>
different optimal mating strategies.<br>
<p>
For example, the ideal mating strategy for a male is to mate with<br>
anything that moves, while females - who can only bear a maximum of one<br>
child per ten months and probably less - seek out either the best genes<br>
or the best (and most faithful) provider.<br>
<p>
Take some experimental statistics.  (Rounded somewhat, since I don't<br>
have the stats in front of me.)  An attractive member of the opposite<br>
gender asked random students the following questions:<br>
<p>
Question								Percentage answering "Yes."<br>
											Male			Female<br>
Would you go on a date with me?		50%			 	50%<br>
Would you go home with me?				65%				9%<br>
Would you have sex with me?				85%				0%<br>
<p>
This difference is not due entirely to cultural and environmental<br>
differences is what I'm trying to say here.<br>
