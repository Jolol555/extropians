Here's something I just posted in the BrainTennis thread that's associated <br>
with the debate between Max More and Paulina Luddite (I forgot her real last <br>
name, so I renamed her appropriately) about the "costs" of Transhumanism.  I <br>
thought this would be of some interest / inspiration  to those who haven't <br>
read it on HotWired's site:<br>
<p>
It's quite humorous for me to read the postings of the Luddites and other <br>
conservatives in this "debate".  So much like children, playing the same games <br>
over and over, never wanting to try new things.  They decry the changes that <br>
Extropians and other adventurous beings seek out... as though their cries for <br>
stagnation could halt the chaotic and uncontrollable processes of Evolution.<br>
	Conservatism used to be a valid survival trait, when the world was pretty <br>
much the same for thousands of years at a time.  To deviate much from the <br>
finely-tuned, traditional ways of life usually meant death.  Now things have <br>
changed.  And so must we, to survive.  Now, and much more so in the coming <br>
years, people and other systems must adapt quickly to the fast and <br>
accellerating changes in our reality.<br>
	Conservatives will be left behind with all the other extinct species.  <br>
Countries like China resisted change for a long time, but they could not <br>
withstand the pressures to become industrialized.  They could not have <br>
survived without doing so.  Likewise, many business people have had to use <br>
modern technologies, such as the portable computer and the cellular phone, <br>
just to remain competetive.  In the coming years, people will likely have to <br>
augment their abilities with such things as biochip implants which connect <br>
their thoughts directly to computers which are linked to the vast computer <br>
networks that will exist throughout the Earth, and possibly beyond.  You may <br>
resist and recoil from these ideas, but in time, they will make a great deal <br>
of sense to you, and you will happily join the other successful people who <br>
will have tried out these technologies and proven their superiority.  To <br>
survive, you will need to adapt to the world; if not, you will simply be left <br>
behind with all the other conservatives.  <br>
	You may think that these fantastic ideas we Extropians embrace will not be <br>
possible.  Most people of a hundered years ago would have doubted the <br>
possiblility of most of the activities we consider commonplace.  The <br>
visionaries of the past, like the current visionaries, were ridiculed, but <br>
they were right.  Humans have a tendency to seriously underestimate what is <br>
truly possible.  <br>
	Humans are developing more and more powerful abilities to alter their <br>
environments and their selves.  Those who take advantage of new and more <br>
powerful technologies have always and will continue to be much more successful <br>
than those who don't.<br>
	Some people in this discussion think an uploaded being will be inferior to <br>
humans.  They have no understanding of the possibilities.  An uploaded being <br>
will have the ability to simulate the experience of human life for itself, in <br>
all of its wonderful and agonizing detail.  It could experience everything we <br>
ourselves experience.  But so much more....  Some Transhumans will be able to <br>
experience millions of different human lifetimes, in as much rich detail as <br>
humans actually do - even more, if they want to, and they can live all those <br>
millions of lifetimes in only a few days or minutes (our time).  The <br>
possibilities are endless....<br>
	Some people think that uploaded transhumans will be located in some single <br>
box or mainframe computer, and that they could be unplugged or destroyed <br>
easily.  This is very incorrect.  Uploaded Transhumans will distribute their <br>
selves throughout many computer networks.  It will be as impossible (actually <br>
much more impossible) to precisely locate the Uploaded Transhuman as it is to <br>
locate your "self" in your brain; your self is distributed all throughout your <br>
brain.  Transhumans will also distribute themselves as far as they can through <br>
whatever means are available.  They will take care of themselves, controlling <br>
very advanced machines to maintain, defend and expand the hardware that they <br>
exist in.  It will be very difficult for them to die off or be killed off.  <br>
Taking down a few machines that they are using to live, will be sort of like <br>
killing a few of your brain cells.  But the Transhumans will be able to <br>
regenerate themselves much more easily than you can regenerate dead brain <br>
cells.  They can also use machines to burrow deep into the Earth and build <br>
extensive computer networks beyond the reach of any disgruntled humans.  They <br>
will be far superior, in every way, to mere humans.  As wonderful as we humans <br>
are now, we haven't even come close to our true potential.  We have nothing to <br>
lose but our limitations.<br>
	Whether you like it or not, the type of things we Extropians are talking <br>
about WILL happen.  Evolution doesn't stop.  It will relentlessly continue and <br>
cast off all who can't or refuse to keep up.  We don't really care whether the <br>
luddites and other conservatives agree with us and support our endeavors or <br>
not.  We're just letting you know what's coming.  If or how you deal with it <br>
is up to you.  You can keep your limitations, if you wish, but ultimately, <br>
they will cost you your existence.<br>
