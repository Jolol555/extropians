Yeah, I tried to really simplfy it, as it had been first explained to me<br>
when I first got interested in these beasties in my oceanography class,<br>
some 3 years ago.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;will break apart and precipitate out of solution, which is how egg</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, it is not "breaking", it is a simple, sharp phase transition from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the precisely defined point in state (=conformation space, form follows</i><br>

I love it when I get someone going in their own wave.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;energy bond points than is used for normal temp organisms allows for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;much higher temperature tolerance, as the bonds are much tighter, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can assure you, extreme thermophiles bugs use exactly the same amino</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;higher temperature. For example, a common protein in bacteria which uses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;iron in its makeup, has a corollary protein in hyperthermophilic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;bacteria (bacteria that can live above boiling) that uses tungsten</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, so you're refering to the cofactors. But this is fringe adaptation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest of the beastie is still conventional. (You're not referring ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Cytochrome C, do you? Do they actually use tungsten instead of iron?)</i><br>

As I recall, it was an archae type, although I could be mistaken. <br>
