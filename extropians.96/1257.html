<i>&gt; One thing that upset/surprised me today listening to Grove's talk </i><br>
<i>&gt; on NPR, is his answer to the question on perspectives of </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology, and whether he thinks it may be used for </i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturing computer chips.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; He answered:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "To tell the truth, I even do not know why we are not using</i><br>
<i>&gt; this technique".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would think a man in his position would have a better knowledge of </i><br>
<i>&gt; perspective technologies.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what do you think: is he so far away from nanotech that he</i><br>
<i>&gt; hasn't heard about it, or so close that he plays dumb?</i><br>
<p>
You mean prospects for nanotechnology, not perspectives; also <br>
prospective technologies, not perspective.   <br>
<p>
I think you are reading too much into what he said.   He didn't say <br>
he had never heard of nanotechnology.  He just said he didn't know <br>
why it isn't already being used to make chips.  <br>
<p>
If I were a competitor of his, I would take this to mean that <br>
1. he has known about the idea of nanotechnology for a long time, <br>
2. he thinks it is basically a valid idea, <br>
3. he has some of his people working on it, <br>
4. they have run into obstacles <br>
    a.  corporate inertia<br>
    b.  a steep learning curve, <br>
5. he expects to be using this technique to make chips, eventually, <br>
6. he is surprised that it is taking so long.  <br>
<p>
Incidentally, my anti-nanotech comments only apply to fantasies about <br>
replacing the entire economy with do-it-yourself genie machines.  <br>
I don't doubt for a minute that it will eventually be possible to "grow" <br>
computer chips, smart materials, fuel cells, and batteries.  This will be <br>
an important part (yes *part* ) of the economy in a few decades.  <br>
