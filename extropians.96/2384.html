Great! I hope the same holds for me. <br>

<p>
Here is the problem: how to program the 'wizard' to make the organs? That <br>
is a very nontrivial challenge (trust me, I have just been at an anatomy <br>
lecture - there are embedded controllers and brilliant tricks just about <br>
everywhere!). <br>
<p>
Designing an organism (say a dragon) from scratch is equivalent to having<br>
a genie machine that you can tell "Build a working spaceship!". It<br>
requires quite a bit of intelligence, although it might manage with<br>
"evolutionary intelligence" if it has enough brute force computing power<br>
(to make that dragon, it would have to do millions of years of evolution<br>
in a reasonable span of time, down to the genetic scale!). <br>
<p>
I'm not saying it is impossible, just quite hard. Modular lifeforms might <br>
make things easier, but life is still very complicated business. <br>

<i>&gt; I watched a show on TV recently in which the girl referred to herself as</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'we' all the time and called her four remaining personalities the 'troops'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; She could recieve messages from all four personalities at once or so it</i><br>

<i>&gt; also heard about personalities writing to other personalities by writing</i><br>
<i>&gt; letters to each other. Is there more than one form of this disorder?</i><br>
<p>
Interesting. Yes, there are many kinds. As far as I know, they might even <br>
have different causes and ways of functioning - the divisions could exist <br>
on different levels. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I was talking about running them. Let's say I want to create a cellular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;automaton universe (the Autoverse) with roughly the same internal size and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;complexity as the solar system. Assume we use clever compression so we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;only have to deal with the places where matter exists, then we have around</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;10^31 kg of virtual matter, containing around 10^23 "atoms" each - 10^54</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bits for the whole simulation. This simulation will not run in a computer </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;smaller than a star unless we can find some very clever optimizations...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do we really need to animate all the atoms which don't currently serve any</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical use? We can simply suspend all atoms except for the ones which</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're using and as the virtual cities grow and size and complexity of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe grows, so will the processing power.</i><br>
<p>
Yes and no. I would of course add this kind of optimization (why simulate<br>
miles of pointless rock at the planetary core at the same resolution as<br>
the surface dwellers' brains?), but it won't solve the main problem: such<br>
a world would be inherently computationally expensive. We cannot compress<br>
it beyond its Kolmogoroff complexity (the shortest program that generates<br>
it at a certain timeslice), and by definition, being an interesting and<br>
comparably complex world, it would have a complexity comparably to our<br>
own. <br>
<p>
I somewhat envy the protagonists in _Permutation City_, who have <br>
literally unlimited computing power...<br>
<p>
Until I get my neutron star computer, I plan to make small worlds.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The sum of human knowledge sounds nice. But I want more. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I completely agree! More is better but do we even know what more is yet?</i><br>
<i>&gt; You're looking for quantity which is 'more' but we don't even know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; awesome technologies are going to flow out of that great expanse of 'more'.</i><br>
<p>
True. But what I'm looking for is not technology, I want knowledge (and a <br>
certain amount of wisdom). We cannot predict what is to be learned or <br>
developed beforehand (otherwise we would know it already), but I bet it <br>
will be interesting and beautiful!<br>
