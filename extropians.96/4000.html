<i>&gt; &gt; 	But, do feelings and emotions not have a logical and reasonable</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Self-preservation?  Attainment of wealth?  I maintain that emotions ARE</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; designed logically</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; that's a contradiction in terms you say that emotions and logic is</i><br>
<i>&gt; essential the same. You have just redesigned the english language.</i><br>
<p>
	Have I?  That must have escaped me.  First of all, your basic<br>
assertion is incorrect. I did not state that emotions and logic are the<br>
same thing.  I stated that emotions have a logical and reasonable basis. <br>
Secondly, even if I had, is the term "emotions" itself not a construction<br>
of man?  Language does not exist independently of us, we DO design it.<br>
Consider the fact that the definition of emotion may be slightly<br>
incorrect anyhow.  Could we not ammend our vernacular?  Of course we<br>
could.  Mind, this is not what I am doing, it's not what I said, but for<br>
arguments sake...<br>
	100 years ago death meant something entirely different than it<br>
does today, we are continuously updating and changing that definition.  As<br>
well as "life", "mind", "consciousness".  Look up the definition of any of<br>
these and tell me how many entries you find.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; , just designed generally on an unconscious level hence </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we are sometimes unable to see the reasoning behind them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You got a partner? What logic made you choose her?</i><br>
<p>
	Indeed I do, and when I first met her I will admit that I was<br>
immensely attracted to her for reasons that were far beyond me.  I<br>
couldn't see any logical reason why I should be with her at all, except<br>
for the fact that that is what I "felt" I should do.  The act of falling<br>
in love completely clouded my vision, but once I could step back and see<br>
threw the mist I found reasons.  I am an extremely technical individual<br>
who is always trying to find a way to express myself, but very seldom<br>
succeeding because I can't seem to find the appropriate "artistic" means.<br>
It just so happens that she is an artist, and able to open me up to knew<br>
means of self-expression.  In addition, she herself is not very<br>
technically minded, but is always asking questions.  Teaching her from<br>
such a beginning level has forced me to look at what I do in new and<br>
creative ways in order to better show her.  I have gained new insight into<br>
my own work that I wouldn't have normally attained had it not been for her<br>
inquiries.  Just on a very simplistic level we are contributing to the<br>
betterment of each other.  I won't go into details about child-bearing and<br>
food gathering... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Most of the most important choices we make in life is guided by feeling.</i><br>
<p>
	Which is guided by reason.<br>
<p>
BTW, I checked out your graphic novel today, it's very nice, my<br>
compliments!<br>
