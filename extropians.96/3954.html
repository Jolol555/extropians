<p>
I won't judge you by your age, if you won't judge me by mine.  Ok?  <br>
<p>
I know exactly where you are coming from.  I've been there.  <br>
"remember that you are your mind... "    Oh yes...  I remember writing <br>
almost exactly the same thing at the same age.  I wasn't a teenager <br>
either.  Years later, it dawned on me that I only had one chance to be <br>
a teenager, and I missed it.  That's water under the bridge;  I'm happy <br>
with the way my life has turned out, and there's no use having regrets <br>
about the steps it took to get here;  but still, if I had it to do over, <br>
I think I would have lightened up a little.  There is nothing wrong <br>
with being 17 or any other age.  <br>
