The explosive used in 95% of all commercial blasting is ANFO, a mixture of <br>
94.5% fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and 5.5% Diesel oil, <br>
if you want to make a lot you can make it in a cement mixer. When NH4NO3 <br>
explodes it produces N2O and 2H2O, N2O (laughing gas) is a powerful oxidant, <br>
so when it combines with Diesel oil it considerably increases it's yield. <br>
ANFO is rather slow as explosives go and the pressure wave is only about 35% <br>
as high as Dynamite, but it does have three advantages, it's very stable, <br>
it's easy to make, and it's very cheap, about 9 cents a pound.<br>
<p>
I don't think there is any doubt that ANFO can bring down a building if you <br>
have enough of it, even straight NH4NO3 can be  dangerous. In 1947 a ship in <br>
Texas City Texas was being loaded with paper pages filled with ammonium <br>
nitrate  fertilizer. Somehow a fire started in the hold of the ship, the crew <br>
then sealed the hold, apparently thinking that would smother the fire, <br>
instead it caused so much heat and pressure that the fertilizer exploded. <br>
People 10 miles away in Galveston were knocked to the ground, at least 600 <br>
people died and many thousands were injured.<br>
