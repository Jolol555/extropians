<i>&gt;   I am starting to see a pattern with you of making a post, then becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt;upset and accusing others of being nasty when your viewpoint is healthily</i><br>
<i>&gt;questioned and the truth of it challenged. I am just commenting impartially. </i><br>
<p>
I would have thought that my participation in many involved and <br>
spirited debates on the other list would have disproved that, but it <br>
does not seem to be the case.<br>
<p>
I comment from the view of having been a facilitator for many years.  <br>
I sense a strong exclusionary tone on this list, and I'm not into <br>
that.  I stay out of Mensa for similar reasons.<br>
<p>
If being extropian means checking my emotions at the door, than, <br>
fine, I should seek other fora.<br>
