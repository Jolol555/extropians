<p>
It was precisely because I did understand the soliloquies that I<br>
walked away with the distinct urge to brush my teeth after I put the<br>
book down.  Ayn Rand strikes me as the type of author (ie, a cult<br>
looking for a place to happen) much like Heinlein who must be read<br>
while one is young and impressinable to _truly_ take root.  I know<br>
there is a great degree of truth in that statement regarding<br>
Heinlein-- I am still in the data collection stage regarding Rand.<br>
<p>
I read AS as a graduate student in engineering, and came to the<br>
conclusion that Ayn Rand was an extremist of the same type but<br>
opposite polarity as the dyed-in-the-wool socialists and communists.<br>
<p>
I have a remarkably low tolerance for extremists of any stripe,<br>
whether they realize they are extremists or not.  See also the good<br>
Dr. Brin, whose writings I enjoy, but whose opinions on privacy and<br>
encryption are so oddball as to defy classification onthe normal<br>
political axes.<br>
<p>
Please don't even get me started on the actual quality of _writing_ in<br>
Atlas Shrugged_ either.  A literary genius, she ain't.<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong-- I'm the first to admit (loudly) that political<br>
thought in America has swung far too much toward willing<br>
redistribution of wealth, and silly, pointless, special interest<br>
spending for anyone's comfort or benefit.  The staggering amounts of<br>
money taken out of my paychecks every other week bear testimony to<br>
that.(*)  But I fancy myself an intelligent enough man to realize that<br>
running from one extreme headlong into the other one is likely to be a<br>
Bad Idea.<br>
<p>
I give the libertarians the fact that they have some good ideas-- a<br>
few-- and a philsophy that would do us a vast amount of good, in<br>
moderation.  But I no more consider myself a libertarian than a<br>
communist, a republican, a democrat, a babboon, or any other lesser<br>
form of primate.<br>
<p>
*	But if I could just get my damned Social Security back, I'd<br>
promise not to bitch about taxes for the next five years, if they<br>
didn't go up again.<br>
