<i>&gt; This is a thread which I have REALLY TRIED to get started for QUITE</i><br>
<i>&gt; SOME TIME. There are new technologies being explored which may lead to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability for us to manipulate the weather across the globe. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; lesser of the two major climate manipulation technologies can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplished by injecting large amounts of silver nitrate into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; I-wall of a hurricane to dissolve it. The greater of the two is called</i><br>
<i>&gt; HAARP. To sum things up, HAARP is about a military technology being</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed in Alaska called High-Frequency Active Auroral Research</i><br>
<i>&gt; Program (HAARP) in which you could create artificial satellites that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could bounce signals off of by heating sections of the atmosphere</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a highly focused radiowave beam. This HAARP technology is in it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; infancy so its possible that with a few breakthroughs in amplifying</i><br>
<i>&gt; the power of the highly-focused radio beam, that we could ultimately</i><br>
<i>&gt; control global climate by heating sections of the atmosphere in</i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns to move moisture around. Technology like this could be used</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the benefit of mankind by dissolving hurricanes before they make</i><br>
<i>&gt; contact with coastlines or moving rain clouds into drought areas but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it can also be used as an incredible weapon which is surely the reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the US defense department having a hand in the development.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Imagine if during the Gulf War we had the power to turn Iraq into an</i><br>
<i>&gt; inland sea by using a technology like HAARP to create major flooding</i><br>
<i>&gt; and literally destroy the country? Can we forsee ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; manipulating global climate in, lets say the next 20 years? Is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; United States responsible enough to use this type of power for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; good of the people? Saving millions of dollars and thousands of lives?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What possible side effects could occur? Should we take the risk?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
HAARP is going to be the Area 51 of the 21st century.  It will have all<br>
sorts of things ascribed to it, a few of which will be true, the rest<br>
will be pure bogosity.<br>
