Your first view interprets the word "meaning" as entirely subjective, which<br>
is certainly not what I intended.  What I'm trying to get at is whether<br>
there is more to "the meaning of life" thah just a collection of various<br>
people's opinions.  Can we come up with some objective purpose(s)?<br>
<p>
Your second view strikes me as meaningless.  In essence, you are saying<br>
existence is all the justification you need in defining your goals.<br>
<p>
Is there a third view?  Does anyone here think there is a "purpose" to life<br>
that does not require the existence of a creator/god/punisher?<br>
<p>
It seems to me that extropianism *does* assume a purpose.  That purpose is<br>
intellectual and technological progress.  Perhaps you can claim that is all<br>
still very subjective, but I think it isn't -- we just haven't yet<br>
discovered (or at least articulated) the objective part.  Perhaps we need<br>
to learn more about ourselves and the universe before we can do that.<br>
<p>
What goes up must come down.  I say "Forward and Outward!"<br>
