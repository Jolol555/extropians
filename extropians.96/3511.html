<i>&gt; So don't bother persuading them, either!  At most, present uploading as</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that people who want to can do; if you know people will want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to, keep it to yourself -- don't try to force them to change their</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-conceptions to that extent.  But, it's your foot to shoot off...</i><br>
Another good point.  I don't think you're going to have a choice.  In a<br>
sense you will, but by that point we'll be so smart that the correct<br>
choice will be totally obvious.  I'll try to say that if anyone, once<br>
superintelligent, wants to stay in their physical body, they will<br>
undoubtedly be permitted to do so...<br>
Again, you make a good memetic point.  Uploading in the disembodied<br>
sense shouldn't be discussed without a good reason.  Upgrading (to avoid<br>
obsolescence) should be mentioned and even exalted, but nothing should<br>
be mentioned to be taken away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Eliezer, wake up!  I'm not saying it's not gripping -- I'm saying it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; repulsive!  If you take no other piece of advice I offer, take this one:</i><br>
<i>&gt; toss the "end" idea altogether, and replace it completely with the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "new beginnings".  To most people, endings mean grief (basic psychology)</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- you don't want people associating Singularity with loss, but with gain.</i><br>
Yes!  Somebody is thinking in terms of psychology instead of elaborate<br>
debates!  I'll take your advice.  Parenthetically, though, shouldn't the<br>
end of misery be a joy (very basic psychology, derived from a<br>
behaviorist book about rats)?  I take your point, though.  Now the only<br>
problem is avoiding contamination from the "New Age" meme...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People want to be at the helm, not overrun by a juggernaut.</i><br>
Can't think of any way to get around that one without just plain lying. <br>
I'll try to present it in a nice way, though:  "WE will have powers<br>
beyond OUR imagination..."<br>
<p>
Thanks for the practical advice - the only practical advice I've gotten<br>
so far.  Your points on some things being hard to accept have been<br>
absorbed into my writing skills forever and ever.  I do think we<br>
disagree on some points of the Singularity - you seem to think of it as<br>
a singular "wham" rather than an iterated "*WHAM*".  The recursive<br>
nature of *WHAM* is perhaps clearer to me than to others.  Normal humans<br>
are rarely *completely* outclassed, which makes it both harder to convey<br>
and - now that I think about it - more frightening.  I, as an Algernon,<br>
am still awed by "Godel, Escher, Bach" years later...<br>
