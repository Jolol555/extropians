We cannot stand together to face the future if we cannot tolerate our own<br>
petty differences. We make cracks at all sorts of serious subjects, but<br>
isn't that what humor is all about? We mean absolutely no offense and you<br>
shouldn't be offended. One thing we learned when we came to the 'new world'<br>
was tolerance for other people's opinions even if we disagreed with them and<br>
this train of thought is spreading across the globe. If we don't agree with<br>
someone else's opinion, you can make a logical response to why that<br>
individual is incorrect, but do not become emotional and fire back a flame!<br>
This only stirs up an argument. I mean, how could you use the internet if<br>
you were offended by every piece of material deemed wrong by your values?<br>
You couldn't. You can't block it all with SurfWatch-ish programs. You must<br>
learn TOLERANCE.<br>
