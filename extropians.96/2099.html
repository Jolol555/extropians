Steve quoting Bertrand Russell:<br>

<p>
I think Steve's point is that logic and emotion are *both* components of<br>
higher-level constructs like knowledge and understanding.  How is this a<br>
false division?<br>
<p>
May I suggest another division? There are both rational and irrational<br>
emotions.  In a slightly different way, there is formal knowledge and<br>
annecdotal knowledge.  Rationality has both completeness and consistency<br>
aspects.<br>
<p>
Your response seems to be an emotional reaction to Russell's quote:  A<br>
justifiably visceral reaction (which I share) to 'good things' (logic,<br>
rights) being yoked to 'bad things' (slave, emotion).  Your reasoning,<br>
that Russell's statement is foolish, is _correct_ in so far as it goes<br>
(using your understanding that emotions are too often irrational); BUT,<br>
it's probably not _consistent_ with Russell's context - Russell was<br>
probably using 'emotion' to refer to 'good' emotions, like loyalty,<br>
charity, love and the aspects that QueeneMuse mentions:<br>
&lt;with emotion you can create. You can generate. You can luminate. With<br>
emotions you can fulfill and enrichen. You can move and you can soar.<br>
[snip] In a well balanced, non reactive type B person, most emotions are<br>
useful ... If emotions have a bad rap in the world, it is precisely<br>
because people think they are at the mercy of them.&gt;<br>
<p>
To which Ira responds:<br>
&lt;I think what you are really saying is that, contrary to Bertrand<br>
Russell, emotions can be a good thing *if* they are tamed by reason and<br>
understanding.&gt;<br>
<p>
This could be just as one-sided as B. Russell's 'reason slaved to<br>
emotion'.  Emotions can also effectively constrain reason (in warning<br>
you what it is worthwhile to apply your logic to) and inspire<br>
understanding.  This sounds more like what QueeneMuse and Steve W. were<br>
getting at.<br>
<p>
As Natasha Vita More added:<br>
&lt;Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think<br>
of exercising the management of emotions.&gt;<br>
<p>
My point is that value-free logic doesn't exist.<br>
<p>
That quote from Bertrand Russell is so startling and powerful because it<br>
comes from a mathematical genius, someone who knew as much about logic<br>
as anyone in human history, and yet had a rather difficult time<br>
harnessing the emotions in his own personal life. (This from a Wall St.<br>
Journal review of a Russell biography that I saw within the last few<br>
months.)<br>
