I think it is a good analogy, although perhaps even better is the <br>
ecological concept of ecological succession: first the probes arrive and <br>
start to create an infrastructure (seeding asteroid belts with nanites to <br>
build solar collectors, assemblers, computing power and lauching new <br>
probes), then this infrastructure is colonized by infomorphs beamed over <br>
from other systems or begins to evolve on its own, filling up the solar <br>
system, and then it entersa mature phase where it controls most of the <br>
system and all changes are cultural, corresponding to the climax ecology. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If this scenario is valid then perhaps *creative* intelligence might </i><br>

<i>&gt; and persistence of their probe ancestors.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, the probes will probably be smart, but not that smart. <br>
Evolution/design would favor designs that can be launched very quickly to<br>
high speeds from most systems. I think this would favor small, dumb, fast and<br>
adaptable probes, perhaps small balls of nanites launched with solar-powered<br>
javellin launchers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would there be any possibility for the always-moving-on probes to ever </i><br>
<i>&gt; learn from the environment (other than reflex reactions, such as </i><br>
<i>&gt; avoiding clouds of antimatter or blasts of lethal radiation)? Would </i><br>
<i>&gt; there be any way (or even need) for the probes and colonists to </i><br>
<i>&gt; communicate and adapt based on each other's knowledge?</i><br>
<p>
This is probably a good idea. The above nanoballs would simply set up <br>
shop on a suitable asteroid, build a solar collector, a bigger mind and <br>
an antenna, and then download information from the stay-at homes (such as <br>
new designs, warnings and plans for the system). So the probes could be <br>
viewed as a two-stage lifeform, with a passive interstellar larval stage, <br>
and a sentinent stellar adult stage. The adults could also beam out <br>
information about the system and what they had learned backwards and to <br>
other probes. <br>
<p>
For an interesting fictional treatment of the technosphere scenario, with <br>
some thoughts about nasty SI, I recommend _Scratch Monkey_ by Charles <br>
Stross. It can be found on the net at:<br>

(I admit I was inspired by it to write my little story posted today, <br>
although I reverse his scenario)<br>
