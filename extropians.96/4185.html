Someone unknown to me (see end of message) said :-<br>
<i>&gt;Am I infected with some sort of "100% natural" meme?</i><br>
Seems like it to me.<br>
If it's wrong to save a life threatened by a (relatively) simple<br>
genetic disorder like that, then most medical practice would<br>
be *very* wrong. Cryonics, which presupposes that genetically <br>
determined ageing can be slowed, stopped or reveresed, would<br>
be an anathema.<br>
<p>
If, by letting a person die, you are saving them from an (almost) certain<br>
life of suffering, then it may be less wrong. But if the malady stands a <br>
good<br>
chance of being cured, and if a long (possibly *very* long) healthy life <br>
may lie ahead, then I think you can say you did the right thing.<br>
<p>
Natural is what we are forced to live with. We have better ways of fixing <br>
the<br>
gene pool (or at least the effects of the gene pool) these days than <br>
letting<br>
children choke to death, as 'nature' seems to have intended...<br>

PS. As it says in the Extropian list welcome message :-<br>
<i>&gt; 2d) It is strongly recommend but not required that all list members use </i><br>
a<br>
<i>&gt;  signature file containing their e-mail address.</i><br>
My mail comes via gateways that filter out SMTP headers. If it's not in <br>
the .sig, I don't know who is posting. I know it's a problem at my end,<br>
but it's not fixable without buying a whole non-SMTP email<br>
system here. I'm sure I'm not alone in this situation. Thanks.<br>
