Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt;I do not buy the argument we do not know enough to make a 100% sustaining</i><br>
<i>&gt;meal yet; some people have lived for decades on intravenous nutrient</i><br>
<i>&gt;solutions with no ill effects.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I don't belive that those solutions were purely syntethic, were they?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The main argument against the "meal in the pill" is simply that it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;not be very fulfilling; our appetite is regulated much by taste, texture</i><br>
<i>&gt;and enjoyment, and I guess a nutrient meal would tend to the boring (it</i><br>
<i>&gt;could of course be spiced up, but then we would be going full circle back</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the breakfast Chris wanted to avoid in the first place).</i><br>
<p>
I see enjoyment from food pretty much the same way as sex.<br>
Sure, it's fun, but I rather spend most of my time being creative<br>
in more intellectual ways.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personally I would like to develop this area anyway, since I love great</i><br>
<i>&gt;food, and if it could be healthy and nutritious *and* delicious, CR diets</i><br>
<i>&gt;would suddenly become much easier.</i><br>
<p>
Every culture has its own cuisine of food and flavors. It's time to deepen<br>
the Extropian Kitchen!<br>
