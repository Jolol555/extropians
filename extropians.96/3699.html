<p>
Not sure what you mean.  One meaning of "apology" is explanation.  One<br>
shouldn't feel required to explain oneself in order to feel worthy of<br>
having a point of view or values.  Explanation needs to be a choice--<br>
you can't let other people's demands or lack of understanding be the only<br>
thing that determines what you spend your time talking about.<br>
<p>
Of course I believe explanation and defining terms are often grand and<br>
useful things.  But in this thread they actually weren't to the point.<br>
(But I will do some of them below since this other issue has come up.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the Church of the Euthanasia believes they're working for a better</i><br>
<i>&gt;future, which happens to involve the reduction or extinction of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;human race.  Are they extropic?  Why not?  They're pushing for a better</i><br>
<i>&gt;future!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think that's the point.</i><br>
<p>
They probably wouldn't think of describing themselves as "extropian," and<br>
I do.  That's a clue.  Also, they have gotten past the block of feeling<br>
uncomfortable expressing values, which is something we could learn from.<br>
<p>
Anyway, like I said, I don't think it was the original point of contention<br>
on this thread.  The thread went something like this (sorry, forgetting<br>
names!):<br>
<p>
  X: Some extropians seem to want to be non-human rather than trans-human.<br>
  Y: Trans-human is necessarily non-human to some extent, and you're being<br>
     intolerant.<br>
  Me: No, by "non-human," X meant lacking important essential human stuff.<br>
     That's valuing, not intolerance.  To me, extropy means improvement.<br>
  Z: You can't call someone non-extropian because they don't share your<br>
     values.<br>
  Me: I only meant that not-valuing, going along with whatever happens, is<br>
     not what extropian means to *me*.<br>
<p>
So the original point was whether it's okay (and clear) to use "non-human"<br>
as a derogatory term, without defining what one means exactly.  I think<br>
it is, but today (walking down the hall at work) I realized I've seen it<br>
become a sore point in discussion groups before.<br>
<p>
I think some people aren't comfortable in discussions where expressing<br>
personal values is okay.  Well, it is okay.  It's something one has to<br>
learn how to do and how to have the courage to do.  There are smooth,<br>
worthwhile, workable ways that those kinds of discussions can proceed.<br>
Furthermore, having habits that make it not okay for oneself or others<br>
to feel comfortable expressing values is a bad thing.<br>
<p>
A "Nerd" is the techie equivalent of the soldier whose place "is not to<br>
reason why."  Are we nerds?  I say let's not make discussions of value<br>
impossible by (inadvertently?) insisting on nerd styles of discussion.<br>
<p>
That's the original meta-point.  An offshoot is what *I* value, what *I*<br>
consider "essentially human," and what I consider extropic.  Well, funny<br>
thing, in this case it's the same as the meta-point.  I value the ability<br>
to value.  I think valuing is an essential part of being human.  Something<br>
that was not able to value the way we do I would consider inferior in an<br>
important way, no matter how advanced in other ways.  I think extropianism<br>
is *minimally* about actively shaping the future in light of one's values.<br>
(I.e., it's also about other things that weren't involved in this thread.)<br>
<p>
It may seem a very small or obvious point.  But I think it is difficult<br>
in practice to realize, face up to, and carry out just that "little" thing,<br>
and I think some of the messages on this thread show that.<br>
