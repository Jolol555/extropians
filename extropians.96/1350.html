Ian, I have no idea what gave you the notion that I adhere to the idea of <br>
non-relational identity.  It is blatently obvious to me that "things" exist <br>
only in relationship to each other.  I question the very idea of identity <br>
itself.  That's why I say it's all in your head, to categorize "things".  I <br>
think it's arbitrary to divide the world up into parts (and I'm not saying <br>
it's not useful to do so, just that it's arbitrary -- we could divide the <br>
world up differently).  <br>
<p>
I think this is the result that you're coming to by saying that one "thing" <br>
exists only in relationship to the rest of all existence, not on its own; <br>
therefore every "thing" depends on the rest of existence for its own <br>
existence; therefore no one "thing" can truly be separated from ALL other <br>
"things".  You're basically saying that all existence is one thing.  Which <br>
means that it's arbitrary and just in our heads to categorize the world into <br>
separate "things", since there is only one thing, and it is everything <br>
together.  If this isn't what you're saying, please tell me, but I'm pretty <br>
sure this is what you mean.<br>
<p>
I agree with you completely here.  All is One.  Sure, fine, that's great, BUT <br>
I don't see how this is useful AT ALL.  It's absolutely true, but utterly <br>
useless.  All is one, but all is not uniform.  The world has all kinds of <br>
features, and it is highly detailed.  Figuring out how the details work <br>
together is what's useful, not knowing that all these details are all part of <br>
the same thing, the ONLY thing.  Science is about mapping out the details of <br>
existence, and it is very useful.  Knowing that existence is all of one piece <br>
gives us no information about how the details work together.  The way we <br>
categorize the details is up to us; it is arbitrary, but some ways of <br>
categorizing the details of the world are more useful than others.  And <br>
finding these useful ways of thinking is what's truly of value.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry if you're disappointed that the wonderful jewel of insight you <br>
thought you had is simply a worthless rock.  I'm curious to see your reaction. <br>
 Will you continue to cling to the rock and defend its value, or will you <br>
examine it more closely, realize its lack of value, get rid of it and find <br>
some truly useful ideas to take its place?  Although, your idea may provide <br>
you with a great deal of pleasure, and so it could be considered valuable in <br>
that respect, just not useful with regards to anything else.<br>
<p>
