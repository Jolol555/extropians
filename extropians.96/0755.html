But the big question is if this prevents memory growth. Suppose I use a <br>
fraction of my energy to produce positronium or something similar to <br>
store my information in as I grow. Would the energy needed to communicate <br>
with my remote memory banks become prohibitive? As I understand it, a <br>
sufficiently slowly growing being would never have any problems with <br>
redshifts *inside* itself.<br>

And a sufficiently large being can contain other beings. While the <br>
universe cools and slows down, we are partying inside a splendid <br>
posthuman virtual universe with an unbounded future. <br>
