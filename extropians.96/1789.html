<i>&gt; When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber.  </i><br>
<p>
--Winston Churchill, as quoted by Greg Burch<br>
<p>
The eagles and parrots here are mythological creatures, not actual <br>
animals.  Churchill had a classical education.  He had grown up with <br>
Aesop's fables and many other such stories, in which eagles, lions, <br>
bears, foxes, and so forth are personified.  He was making a statement <br>
about politics, using metaphorical language.  He never intended his <br>
statement to be literally true of birds in nature.  <br>
<p>
An eagle is a far-sighted statesmen who can take in an entire situation <br>
and decide what to do.  When the eagles retire from public discourse, <br>
the parrots take over -- i.e. small-minded people who have no vision and <br>
no judgment of their own, people who can only repeat mindlessly what <br>
they hear.  <br>
