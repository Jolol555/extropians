          You should find something about the dynamics of boolean <br>
          networks in:<br>
          <br>
          Models of Neural Networks I and II, edt. Domany, E., van <br>
          Hemmen, J. L. &amp; Schulten K. (1994) Springer-Verlag.<br>
          <br>
          (part II also contains some interesting results about <br>
          synchronization as a binding mechanism). A big challenge now <br>
          seems to be to derive some properties for networks with <br>
          asymmetric connections (like the brain), but that is much <br>
          more difficult than the symmetric case, since methods from <br>
          thermodynamics are not directly applicable here.<br>
          <br>
          BTW, Eugene, I heard about a suggestion made a number of <br>
          years ago, that perhaps dreaming is a manifestation of <br>
          antihebbian learning. The system is shaked into a random <br>
          state and then allowed to settle into an attractor. Then an <br>
          antihebbian learning rule is applied. When this process is <br>
          repeated, it tends to eliminate spurious attractors, thereby <br>
          increasing the storage capacity of the network from 0.138N <br>
          to about .78N . Do you know whether this beautiful idea has <br>
          been followed up?<br>
