The entropy of an open system can be decreased by having energy flow<br>
through it.  Pick up a book on thermodynamics and look up thermodynamic<br>
engines.  That's how life on Earth originated: heats up by day, cools<br>
off by night, repeat many times.  The total system (i.e. cosmos) still<br>
falls toward equilibrium, at least from our present point of view.<br>
<p>
By the way, there isn't *that* much exactness in the term "extropy."<br>
In particular, minimizing entropy of our immediate neighbourhood is not<br>
very extropian, imho.  Imagine a solar system with all the atoms in a<br>
lattice, in the ground state, with their spins aligned in the same<br>
direction.  Not very uplifting, is it?  :)<br>
