<p>
You're right that you wrote the last item in that thread, 'Community redux'.<br>
I've just gone back and reread it, and now I recall why I dismissed it out<br>
of hand:  what you wrote can effectively be paraphrased as "nothing much<br>
will change".  If that's your view then there's no arguing with it.<br>
<p>
Nanotech will introduce a factor never before present in the history of<br>
mankind:  the means to replicate THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION from elements<br>
freely available in the environment.  If you reckon that the effect of<br>
this will not be revolutionary then your imagination lags far behind that<br>
of most people on these two mailing lists.  Once the means of production<br>
can be tailored at will and replicated at the point of need, production<br>
itself is no longer limited by capital and manpower, only by the presence<br>
of the required feedstock and energy.  That is an utterly collosal change<br>
to the effective limits to growth today, and is most certainly not just<br>
an evolutionary change.<br>
<p>
Have a ponder about the Guy Fawkes scenario or about total honeycombing<br>
of the Earth's crust with communication, water and raw-material pipelines,<br>
and then try to deliver your message of "no major change".  And such<br>
things are just the start of it, easily achievable by one person alone<br>
once quite basic nanotech is available, requiring nothing complicated<br>
like AI/SI might entail.  Just to bring it really home, if a person can<br>
program a nanosystem to create (say) a saltwater pipeline which extends<br>
itself a short distance into the rock under his property, he or she can<br>
in principle create a pipeline extending into the nearest ocean, WITHOUT<br>
requiring any extra capital or manpower or any other resources.  Such<br>
power in the hands of everyman completely destroys the basis of our<br>
current economy, which is founded on the maxim that it is more or less<br>
impossible for any single person to do anything major in a material<br>
sense by him/herself, needing to *purchase* everything, which keeps<br>
the economy rolling and allows governments to reel in taxes.<br>
<p>
Your reply didn't address this basic change at all, Robin.  The only<br>
reasonable counters that I have read are those that suggest that either<br>
the designs of desireable items will be kept clone-proof (which I find<br>
not at all convincing, especially since I am from the GNU software camp<br>
and fully expect the future FNF to be a leading force in nanodesign ---<br>
I myself intend to assist in that);  and, those that say that manufacture<br>
will effectively become a service industry, creating bespoke designs for<br>
people that obviously don't want to be bothered with creating everything<br>
they need or want themselves.  I agree with the latter, although I don't<br>
see why creating *anything* that has been made before should be any more<br>
difficult than programming your washing machine --- the user interface<br>
is surely the simplest thing to make joe-public-friendly.<br>
<p>
The hard part is bootstrapping ourselves from bulk technology to the<br>
very different world of nanotech, but once that is achieved then all<br>
bets are off as to the shape of the planet.  The Drexlerian camp works<br>
very hard to stay for the most part within application areas that the<br>
status quo will not find too fantastic to believe, but the reality of<br>
the matter is that their examples are only the beginning, and are all<br>
exceedingly tame.  If your premise is that nanotech won't happen then<br>
that might be something to argue, but if you accept that it will happen<br>
yet you don't accept that the consequences will be unimaginably massive<br>
and all-embracing then I find nothing to discuss at all:  we would be<br>
inhabiting completely disjoint thought spaces.<br>
