<p>
This perversion strategy requires more confidence that you are in fact<br>
much more advanced than those you attack.  Imagine you see signals<br>
from what looks like a primitive civilization 100 light years away.<br>
Whatever you send to destroy it will face a civilization 200 years<br>
more advanced than what you saw.  If you send a fast simple bomb (and<br>
have it turn a corner), they may end up advancing enough to stop it or<br>
survive it, but you may feel confident that they probably can't find<br>
you from it.  A perversion probe will be lots more complicated, and so<br>
risk telling more about you, and will have be much more advanced than<br>
they are if it is to succeed. <br>
<p>
If your probe fails and reveals you, a probe from them to destroy you<br>
may be coming at near light speed from them to you, so you really want<br>
fast feedback about whether your attack succeeded or not.  A<br>
perversion probe will take longer, increasing your anxiety that what<br>
looks like a slow progress of your attack really masks a return attack.<br>
A bomb either works or it doesn't real fast.<br>
