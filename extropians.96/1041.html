In a private message, someone pointed out what appears to be an error <br>
in my hyperchess challenge:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I hereby issue a challenge to the Extropians:  two years years from now, </i><br>
<i>&gt;in September of 1988, the first annual Checkmate tournament will take </i><br>
                                 ^^^^<br>
<i>&gt;place.   Be there or be square.  </i><br>
<p>
To enter the hyperchess tournament, first you have to build a time machine.  <br>
I never said this game was supposed to be easy.  <br>
<p>
No, seriously:  I apologize for the sloppiness of my recent posts.  It just <br>
occurred to me that in my reply to Tom Quinn, I lost track of my numbering <br>
and called two different points #3.  There is really no excuse for this.  <br>
I can only hope that the content of the post makes up for the errors of detail.  <br>
<p>
I am disappointed by the lack of response to the hyperchess challenge.  <br>
It's easy enough to talk about SuperIntelligence, but when you are called on <br>
to design one, that's a horse of a different color, hmmm?   Anyway the <br>
tournament will take place in 1998, with or without an Extropian team.  <br>
<p>
