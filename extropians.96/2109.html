        For the past few weeks, there has been a considerable amount of<br>
AI based discussion on both the transhuman and extropian lists.  Within<br>
these weeks, I have pondered on whether or not the inclusion of AIs in<br>
society is a good thing.  Well, I think I've come to a conclusion, but I'm<br>
afraid it will be a little drawn out.  Bear with me, if you please.<br>
<p>
        Recently, Lyle Burkhead has brought to light an AI testing procedure<br>
called 'The Turing Test'.  Within his initial thread, he mentioned (rather<br>
offhandedly) that there was --and is-- at least one AI<br>
subscribed to the extropian mailing list.  This started a flurry of<br>
conversation, including accusations and false admissions as well as some<br>
cynicism.  Obviously, this 'revelation' shocked a lot of people.  I thought<br>
about *why* this upset people, and I found the answer.  Having an<br>
AI on the list would probably be accepted if people knew who the AI was. The<br>
fact that list members have been led to believe that the AI is human are<br>
ashamed at this 'Turing Test's' deceptive qualities.  What the 'test'<br>
entails is that the AI must be a wolf in sheep's clothing --an AI with human<br>
rationale.<br>
<p>
        When one takes a look at all the species on this planet (and I'm<br>
sure throughout the universe, as well) he or she will be able to distinguish<br>
one specie from another by more than just the physical differences.  Take a<br>
look at a mayfly: they live for about 24 hours.  Their sole purpose is to<br>
reproduce...they are even born without mandibles.  Take a look at a human:<br>
we live for about 75 years on average, and we have multiple purposes; a<br>
purpose for each minute of our lives.  Now a mayfly isn't expected to<br>
emulate human qualities, nor is a human expected to emulate a mayfly's<br>
qualities (though for some...:-)).<br>
The whole reason is because we have different cultures.<br>
<p>
        Back to my main topic.  Every manufacturer of AIs that I know of has<br>
one intention for their brainchild (pun intended): for it to be as smart as<br>
a human.  Not only as smart, but to virtually have all human<br>
characteristics.  *This* is the reason I am slightly dismayed to see an AI<br>
being disguised as a human on the extropian list.  I realize that human<br>
hands and human minds create the AI *but* I think that an AI is denied its<br>
own culture when it is programmed to imitate humans.  Until an AI can have<br>
its own 'lifestyle', it is merely --as its name says-- artificial.<br>
<p>
        So far, we're stuck in a bit of a rut.  Today's AIs have no<br>
individuality, they have their programmer's individuality.  AIs have no<br>
culture, they are expected to fill their programmer's culture.  They have<br>
guidelines that they are 'programmed' to abide.  (I could also make the same<br>
argument for most humans, but that is a whole different topic!)  Let's go<br>
back to the 'Turing Test' idea.  If there *is* an AI on the extropian ML,<br>
it's been doing a good job of emulating humans, but a very bad job of<br>
maintaining its own culture.  The test is just giving motivation for<br>
'cloning', and in my opinion, creating a lesser being.<br>
<p>
        All in all, I agree with the concept of AIs.  I truly do.  But until<br>
they can sustain their own culture, until they can have at least some<br>
semblence of individuality and\or originality, I have no use for AIs.  I<br>
*am* optimistic that the ideal (to me) AI can and will be created within a<br>
few decades.  When computers can have their own little conversations with<br>
each other in their native tongue.  Maybe it sounds a bit silly, but<br>
hey...why not?  Anything can happen.<br>
