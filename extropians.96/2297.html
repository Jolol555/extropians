<i>&gt;But a engineer's main goal is function whereas an artist's primary goal is</i><br>
<i>&gt;form.</i><br>
<p>
I could not disagree more.<br>
<p>
This is a banal, commonplace trope, and unworthy of you.<br>
<p>
Real, competent engineers appreciate elegance, simplicity, absurdity,<br>
parallelism, reliability and a host of other qualitative characteristics which <br>
are "good art" as they practice it.<br>
<p>
Contrariwise, an artist's primary goal is function--an _illustrator_ or a <br>
_designer_ may have form as his _stated_ objective, but the _function_ of <br>
the work, as an interesting or worthwhile or just irritating form, must still <br>
predominate if the work is to be successful.  QED.<br>
<p>
The Greeks had one word for art and technology. They may have been <br>
mediocre experimentalists, but they got one thing right. :)<br>
