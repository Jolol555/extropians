Well, someone wrote a series of 'Doom' novels, and there are a huge number<br>
based on the D&amp;D universe ;-). Honestly, I'm not so sure about programmed<br>
environments like 'Doom', but I could certainly see people getting<br>
inspiration from software which could, say, generate a new universe from a<br>
choice of physical laws. <br>

What do rich people today get from the poor? They pay them to do the work<br>
that the rich either don't want to do or don't have time to do. Even if a<br>
rich AI is a thousand times faster than a poor AI, it can still double its<br>
effective processing power by hiring a thousand slower AIs to work for it. <br>
They also gain security, because they can stay safely at home and pay<br>
slow AIs to do dangerous work where they might pick up viruses or data<br>
corruption. Actually, this is one of the story ideas I'm working on at the<br>
moment ;-). <br>
