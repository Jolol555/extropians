	Perhaps you measure the 'betterness' in falsifiability. The problem<br>
with God-did-it TOE, or many conspiracy theories, or at least some of<br>
the low-profile theories, is that they're too robust. My sense of<br>
occam's razor is to pick the simplest theory that fits the facts.<br>
Typically that produces a fragile theory. <br>
	Given zero evidence of ETs there are two sets of theories: low profile<br>
(including zoo hypothesis), and they-ain't-there (including 'well maybe<br>
they're there but there is really far away' etc.)<br>
	The low profile set (like the God TOE) is almost immune to<br>
falsification. The No-ET set crashes with any evidence of ET's at all.<br>
Low profile or God TOE or conspiracy theories are not simple when the<br>
standard of simplicity is easy falsifiability.<br>
	What I meant to suggest with the 'Anvil of Stars' reference and<br>
comments on 'What's natural life?' is that having superhuman<br>
intelligences engaging in contests with active deception, means that<br>
there's nothing much from a merely human, still 20th century, point of<br>
view that could possibly falsify the core theory. Ditto for God TOE.<br>
What could possibly be acccepted as conclusive evidence against it?<br>
