<i>                &gt;philosophers are still debating over what causality is.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
When I say that A caused B, I mean that if I place the events observable from  <br>
my frame of reference in a sequence ordered according to time, and I find <br>
event A in the sequence, then I will always find event B at some later point <br>
in the sequence, and that's all I mean. The debate is not so much what it is  <br>
but whether causality exists or not, the answer modern Physics tells us is,  <br>
not always, randomness is possible. <br>
                <br>

<i>                &gt;philosophers still haven't untangled the four types                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;[of causality] they know about -  computational, platonic,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;thermodynamic and  cognitive causality.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
What's the difference between computational and cognitive causality? <br>
Nothing, unless you believe in the soul and other such mumbo jumbo. <br>
<p>
What's the difference between computational and thermodynamic?<br>
Nothing, except that you can't find an effect from a cause in any algorithm <br>
in polynomial time (x^n) you're stuck with exponential time (n^x).<br>
<p>
What's the difference between cognitive and platonic? <br>
Nothing, except cognitive wants to put mind in a special category for some <br>
ill-defined reason. <br>
<p>
What's the difference between computational and platonic?<br>
Nothing near as I can tell, some claim there is a big difference, but are <br>
vague about what exactly it is.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The meaning of life may be defined as a self-justifying goal.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Which self-justifying goal?  Who does the justifying? I want a cookie because <br>
I want a cookie, is that the meaning of life? Perhaps I misunderstand, <br>
perhaps the goal itself does the justifying, but how can a goal by itself <br>
justify anything, much less itself? How can I tell if it is correct?<br>
These are not rhetorical questions, I'd really like to know.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;that type of smartness which has to do with the rotation of                 </i><br>

<p>
<p>
Yeah, that's a part of intelligence, a very dull part, an old Apple II can do  <br>
it better than a person can.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The Meaning of Life is simply something meaningful in and of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;itself, without being part of a greater goal or being urged                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;on us by evolution.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
If I were to say "The Meaning of Life is something" would it contain any less <br>
information than your sentence above? Hypothetically, if The Meaning of Life <br>
were different from what you say, would the world be one bit different from  <br>
what it is now?<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;not all sentences are self-referential,        </i><br>
                 <br>
Certainly true.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>               &gt;nor is the term  "self-referential" empty of content.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Also true, in fact I think self reference is a very profound concept. <br>
It is fun to come up with self referential sentences of thirteen words. <br>
I like statements describing how DNA is self referential and even describes <br>
the construction techniques to duplicate itself, if you know the Genetic Code, <br>
but that the Genetic code is not encoded in the DNA and you can't point to<br>
exactly where it is encoded.  <br>
<p>
The trouble I have is that you used the term "self-justifying", I've never <br>
seen a self-justifying sentence, at least I don't think I have, but I really <br>
don't know what that means.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;An example of a self-justifying entity would be the reason                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;why anything exists at all.         </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
By far the deepest problem in Philosophy, why is there something rather than <br>
nothing? Don't keep us in suspense, tell us everything you know, let's risk <br>
rioting in the streets, complete your example, tell us the reason!<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;An example of a non-self-justifying entity would be the                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;goal of crossing the room.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
- From your statement above we can safely conclude that another example of a  <br>
non-self-justifying entity would be any idea any human being has ever been  <br>
able to formulate in his head. If EVERYTHING is non self justifying then the  <br>
concept has no contrast and so no value.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;"Any major enhancement of human intelligence is a net                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;evolutionary disadvantage." [...] Algernon's Law still works.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Just 3 million years ago, less than 1/1000 of the time life existed on this <br>
planet, you would be in Lucy's world. The smartest animal on Earth looked <br>
much like you or me from the neck down, but had a brain only slightly larger <br>
than a chimp. Did Algernon's law work then, only an instant ago?<br>
<p>
You mentioned that you took Prozac. The only reason to take Prozac is if <br>
despite its negative features it made your brain operate in a way you liked <br>
better than when you did not take Prozac. Evolution never came up with a  <br>
gland that secrets Prozac. Why do you take Prozac?<br>
