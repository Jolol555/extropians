        Too true.  I'm guilty of not explaining *exactly* what I meant by<br>
fact-based discussion.  I *should* have defined it as 'discussion that is<br>
totally factual with no amount of information that is not proven.'  This<br>
would get very boring very fast.  When one adds a little bit of modifying<br>
language to the fact-based discussion, it has a tendency to get more<br>
interesting while still conveying the facts. <br>

        I agree wholeheartedly.<br>

<i>&gt;PS: Who had the car accident on your behalf?</i><br>

        Actually it was just myself...no other cars involved.  It was<br>
raining quite hard when it happened and I must have been going a little bit<br>
too fast for the conditions.  As I approached a stop sign, my brakes locked<br>
and I had to turn the steering wheel as hard as I could, lest I enter a busy<br>
intersection.  The back end broke loose and I skidded into the front yard of<br>
a house, thus lodging the car on a small concrete retaining wall.<br>
Surprisingly enough, the only damage to my car (an Omega...can you imagine<br>
anything else?) was that one of my tires came off of the rim.  There was<br>
also a little bit of damage to my car's undercarriage, but nothing major;<br>
the retaining wall is another story...<br>
