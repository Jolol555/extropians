If one includes ones own future self within the set designated by "ones<br>
children" then one can interpret Hara's remarks as they would apply to<br>
someone who has no gametic offspring, and they still make sense.<br>
<p>
Deathists tend to identify with their genetic offspring (and sometimes, as<br>
in the case of Nietzsche, with their memetic offspring) because they are<br>
convinced of their own mortality. Since you disagree with them about that<br>
conviction, you might as well adjust their terms for them accordingly when<br>
you are trying to interpret and make sense of what they say. I'm not saying<br>
Hara is a deathist (I know better than that!), but we have these<br>
assumptions built into our language still, and it will take a while for<br>
them to vestigiate.<br>
