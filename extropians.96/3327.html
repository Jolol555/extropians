That is rather unfortunate. I fortunately had some rather rational<br>
parents, both technically degreed, who practiced partly from family<br>
tradition, and a need for a solid moral upbringing for their kids. One<br>
thing I would be adamant about defining two different types of religious<br>
behavior: The difference between religious theology or theosophy, and<br>
religious mythology. The former in my opinion tends to have a bit of<br>
extropic potential, while the latter is highly entropic. Seems like<br>
you've been tortured by quite a bit of mythic superstition. I've seen<br>
both types of behaviors by people in the church I was raised in, and the<br>
idiocy of the mythic superstionists made me not wish to continue formal<br>
practicing. Rather, I tend to live a proactive life under the guise of:<br>
" "God" helps those who help themselves". I also, unlike<br>
supertstitionists, have no idea of the location or nature of whatever<br>
caused our universe to come into existence, so rather than atheist, I<br>
tend to be agnostic. I have no convictions either way, and demand proof<br>
of both sides, religious or atheist for their postion. My mother for<br>
example considers herself a Catholic Agnostic, if you can believe it!<br>
