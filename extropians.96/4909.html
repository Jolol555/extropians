In defence of Chris Hind's motives (not his terminology) :<br>
<p>
I think what Chris meant was that most people plan their future based on<br>
their personal well being, and therefore have highly economically motivated<br>
political goals. On the other hand there are those who do the same, but the<br>
period over   which they plan that future, as well as the scope of it,<br>
implies that their goals are not based solely on personal motivations. I<br>
don't think it's so much the masses Chris fears, but some of the people of<br>
the second group, with different goals or with only personal goals, who are<br>
capable of manipulating those masses in the first group. And he's right in<br>
that some counterweight needs to be given, if we are to see anything we<br>
might consider 'goals' realized, if not to prevent that what we have<br>
realized so far, isn't taken away...  <br>
<p>
or like Chris wrote in the other thread:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If</i><br>
<i>&gt;you just sit back and isolation and develop memes without spreading them</i><br>
<i>&gt;then whats the point? "We" will still be sitting here as the memes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;rediscovered by others. It's just like that ancient steam-powered greek</i><br>
<i>&gt;toy. We (society) could've had the industrial revolution back in Greece</i><br>
<i>&gt;long ago but the meme's about it's existance weren't spread and thus the</i><br>
<i>&gt;future was delayed many years.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;just want to accelerate the process as swiftly as possible. We (society)</i><br>
<i>&gt;will get to the future eventually, it's only a matter of time. I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to wait.</i><br>
<p>
neither do i..<br>
<p>
<p>
Eliezer continues:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Resentment of scientists?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;haven't seen it. </i><br>
<p>
Check the natural law party's regular zeroxed leaflet campaigns (against<br>
genetic modification, and other technologies)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The</i><br>
<i>&gt;apathetic and cynical masses don't have a cause worth fighting for;</i><br>
<i>&gt;they'd be up and marching in a flash if they did.</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that the cause they want to fight for, can easily be linked<br>
to or replaced by another cause, someone wants them to march for, examples<br>
in abundance. <br>
