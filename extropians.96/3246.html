Bruce Bower writes in the 11/02/96 Science News<br>
(see <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arch/11_2_96/bob1.htm">http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arch/11_2_96/bob1.htm</a> )<br>
about "Bridging the Brain Gap: A scientist explores the biology of isolated <br>
minds and mutual trust" reporting on the work of neurophysiologist Walter <br>
J. Freeman of Berkeley and the theories he elaborates in his 1995 book, <br>
_Societies of Brains_:<br>
&lt;[T] ansient electrical responses to sensation may preface life-altering <br>
changes in the brain, he<br>
proposes.... Freeman hopes to nudge neuroscientists toward a consideration <br>
of what brains do in<br>
groups, not just inside individual skulls... [B]rain science is in crisis <br>
because our models<br>
neglect the most important function of human brains, which is to interact <br>
with each other<br>
to form families and societies," Freeman contends.... The Berkeley <br>
researcher also rejects the view, widespread in cognitive psychology, that <br>
the mind contains representations of the world in the form of thoughts, <br>
ideas, images, and symbols that are processed according to sets of rules.&gt;<br>
<p>
Freeman contends that mind only emerges at the crossroads of perception, <br>
action and learning.  His studies, particularly research on EEGs in <br>
rabbits, indicate that mammalian brains are constantly being 'rewired' as <br>
life situations change.  Thus, the common transhumanist notion that <br>
uploading our minds to a digital media will somehow give us a qualitatively <br>
NEW way to transform ourselves may be somewhat of a myth.<br>
