<i>&gt;This "sex is obsolete" thread reminds me of an old original Star Trek</i><br>
<i>&gt;episode. It was the one where 3 highly advanced beings held their</i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness in spheres for thousand of years, waiting for someone to</i><br>
<i>&gt;come and help build android bodies for them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;One line I remember, from the being Sargon, was "There was a time in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;history where we dared think of ourselves as Gods." :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;They wanted to assume physical form in order to reexperience the</i><br>
<i>&gt;pleasures of physical touch &amp; intimacy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope a post-human state of existence gives us a choice to experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;the pleasures of life in all forms.</i><br>
<p>

Yes, there have been many Star Trek episodes that suggest regret towards<br>
scientific progress, loss of innocence, and other such nonsense.<br>
<p>
My favorite character was always Mr. Spock.  The only thing I didn't like<br>
about him was his "human" side.  McCoy -- with his incessant ridiculing of<br>
logic -- was annoying.<br>
<p>
The Voyager series is particularly obnoxious with its characters who<br>
worship their primitive ancestors, it's ever-present cultural diversity,<br>
and routine depiction of aliens as humans with birth defects.  I will be<br>
very disappointed if political correctness is still in vogue four hundred<br>
(?) years from now.<br>
