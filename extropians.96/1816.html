The problem domain here is restricted to "technical creative<br>
intelligence." In my experience, "groupthink" can be helpful, but in<br>
general the bulk of the time spent by an innovator is spent waiting for<br>
some process to complete so another decision can be made. By automating<br>
these processes, we can shorten the time between decisions and allow<br>
the consequences to be evaluated more rapidly. <br>

Since I'm arguing that a human/computer collaboration will be more<br>
"intelligent", I'd say that the computer portion of the entity<br>
would include the appropriate filtering. That is, the entity would<br>
spend the time needed to implement the appropriate searchers and<br>
filters.<br>
(Of course, the first move would be to take over all internet News<br>
forwarding code and suppress MAKE MONEY FAST posts :-))<br>
