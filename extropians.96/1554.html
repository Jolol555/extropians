Twirlip ( Damien),<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;The old fee was between $8 and $14.  Sometimes I think charging one cent</i><br>
might be beneficial, just for the filter of physically mailing something.<br>
<p>
    I agree.. it could be interpreted as a measure of commitment  <br>
I would  not mind paying $14 or more, if it was helpful in making this a<br>
stronger list.  I was just about to when the list  opened up.    If someone<br>
starts another closed list maybe they'll charge a fee -but the juried peer<br>
review is also a good measure.<br>
<p>
{ BTW  re: splinter groups just yet,  because so far Extropy has few<br>
members....I think, for me,  personally refraining from  posting huge gobs of<br>
long posts and internally monitoring by S.O.( spontaneous order or self<br>
ownership ; ) is a better way to address the current "challenge" to quality.<br>
Look,  Eugene  had to *ask* if he  contributed to the noise by posting<br>
forwarded references... if so, no one has said anything..  <br>
I use those references often, especially the URLs. I *still* suggest those of<br>
you  who have clear Extropian values and quality judgement, address  "junk"<br>
 as it happens., politely and swiftly instead of making scatter shot<br>
comments, after. )<br>
