          I disagree. It is not a tricky matter though; I have written <br>
          a serious critique (approx. 14pp) over the Doomsday argument <br>
          which I would be very glad to distiribute to clear-headed <br>
          people on this list, for comments. I plan to submit it for <br>
          publication later.<br>

          The Shooting Room: Eliezer wrote that the chances of winning <br>
          in Robin's variation of the Shooting Room (where it is not <br>
          known whether an even would win or it would require a double <br>
          6) were ((1/6) + 1/36) / 2)=7/72. I think that Robin's idea <br>
          was that in a given situation, if I find myself in a room <br>
          with very many of people, then that would indicate that it <br>
          was difficult to win (i.e. that it would require a doubble <br>
          six), since otherwise the experiment would probably have <br>
          terminated before that many people got into the room. This <br>
          would make 7/72 a bad estimate. -The connection which Robin <br>
          seems to see between this variation and the doomsday <br>
          argument is not immediately clear to me, however.<br>

          "A new paradox": I missed the original posting about the <br>
          $1000 and $1000000 situation, but I gather that it is <br>
          "Newcomb's paradox" that is being discussed. It is not very <br>
          "new" though; a lot has been written about it (mostly in <br>
          decision theory). I would choose the $1000 alternative.<br>
