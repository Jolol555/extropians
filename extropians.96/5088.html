The following is an excerpt from Breakthrough!, a service of Sean<br>
Morgan.<br>
<p>
<p>
Lunar Ice?<br>
<p>
There is unconfirmed evidence of water ice in a crater near the southern<br>
pole of the Moon. Earlier results from Clementine indicated a 150 km<br>
wide<br>
crater near the south pole was in permanent darkness, fuelling hopes<br>
that<br>
water might one day be discovered there. At a Pentagon news conference<br>
on<br>
December 3 it was announced that radar evidence suggesting the existence<br>
of<br>
water ice.<br>
<p>
One report said that this might be a prelude to discovering microbes on<br>
the<br>
Moon. Rubbish.<br>
<p>
Several reports referred to this as a source of feedstock for rocket<br>
fuel<br>
production. Since this is only a "small pond's" worth of water, it would<br>
not<br>
last long if used for fuel. Lunar water is much too valuable for closed<br>
life<br>
support systems to turn into rocket fuel. Besides, the ubiquitous lunar<br>
aluminum makes a quite passable rocket fuel.<br>
<p>
"Clementine" (actually the first in a series of missions with that name)<br>
was<br>
a remarkable mission, "the little space probe that could". Launched in<br>
1994,<br>
its primary mission was to test systems for Ballistic Missile Defense<br>
Organization (BMDO). By international treaty that's a no-no in earth<br>
orbit,<br>
so the probe was sent to the moon. The study of the moon (during 70 days<br>
of<br>
orbit) was incidental secondary mission -- 1.8 million pictures were<br>
taken.<br>
A computer problem made it impossible to complete a planned flyby of the<br>
asteroid Geographos (a follow-up Clementine mission will attempt another<br>
asteroid fly-by).<br>
<p>
This hugely successful mission cost just $75 million, extraordinarily<br>
inexpensive for a space mission. In the wake of the failure of the Mars<br>
Observer, Clementine's legacy is the "better, faster, cheaper" approach<br>
evident in NASA's recent deep space exploration.<br>
