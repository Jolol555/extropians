<i>&gt;If we learned how to alter the structure of space-time itself, that would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;really amazing.  That would be the universe hacking it's own kernal, </i><br>
<i>&gt;trancending itself.  Perhaps that's what it's been doing all along; hacking </i><br>
<i>&gt;it's own kernal, to make it more intelligent next time it reboots, modifying </i><br>
<i>&gt;it's design and then allowing the system to play itself out until it </i><br>
<i>&gt;spontaneously reboots itself.</i><br>
<p>
Very interesting idea! Why didn't I think of this post! We all already<br>
realize that the universe is merely a computer for which life runs on with<br>
genetics (the code) the laws of physics (the processor).  I wonder how far<br>
we will transcend or raise the bar of quality and complexity in this session?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or perhaps, as Chris </i><br>
<i>&gt;Hind brought up, the universe will learn how to create baby universes which </i><br>
<i>&gt;also become self-aware, and able to improve themselves and do the same type of </i><br>
<i>&gt;thing their parent universe did, inheriting a lot of it's basic </i><br>
<i>&gt;characteristics.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps this is the answer to our Great Filter thread? Maybe sometime in our<br>
near future we discover how to create a baby universe and we enter it and<br>
break off from the rest of the universe which is why there is no one out<br>
there to communicate with. We would have transcended out of our current<br>
universe into a baby universe where we define the laws of physics and just<br>
like a programming language, create a new programming language more powerful<br>
than the last one much like the transition from coding assembly to C++ to<br>
better versions and other specialized languages. I wonder if the previous<br>
civilizations that coded our current universal kernel added any remarks into<br>
the code as a signature.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  There is the possibility that the universe itself is an </i><br>
<i>&gt;organism, in an environment of other universes.  They may be breeding and </i><br>
<i>&gt;feeding off each other.</i><br>
<p>
What would you call this organism? Super Gaia? hehe or Unigaia (which i like<br>
better).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then these </i><br>
<i>&gt;will do the same sort of thing that we did, continually reproducing.  Perhaps </i><br>
<i>&gt;our universe has ancestors.  What an intriguing idea!</i><br>
<p>
It would be _very_ interesting to see what these ancestor universes would<br>
look like! Perhaps there is an infinite stream of baby universe upon baby<br>
universes behind us? Or is it finite? I wonder how the first universe would<br>
look like? Probably we wouldn't be able to visit it because no form of life<br>
could exist there.<br>
