As an example of the kind of thinking that is becoming prevalent, I <br>
submit Kirkpatrick Sale's explanation as to why your home PC is an <br>
ecological disaster area and an affront to human rights:<br>
<p>
	About computers, over which much dispute rages, it suffices<br>
	to say that they have two fundamental, fatal flaws--quite<br>
	apart from the fact that a great deal of pollution and<br>
	sweatshop labor is involved in their manufacture, some real<br>
	risks to health and bodily function are connected to their<br>
	operation, considerable deskilling and job displacement result<br>
	from their corporate use, and increasing surveillance and <br>
	invasion of privacy attend their proliferation.  First, in the<br>
	hands of the large centralizing corporations and bureaucracies<br>
	that devised and perfected them in the first place, and in <br>
	service to the goals of production, profitability and power,<br>
	computers are steering the world toward social inequity and<br>
	disintegration and toward environmental instability and collapse,<br>
	and doing so with more speed and efficiency with every passing <br>
	year--regardless of how many people on the Internet believe they<br>
	are saving the planet.  Second, computers interpose and mediate<br>
	between the human and natural world more completely than any <br>
	other technology--they are uniquely capable of reproducing <br>
	another nature through biotechnology and many virtual ones--and<br>
	are the instruments that primarily energize the technosphere<br>
	that not merely distances this civilization from nature but sets<br>
	it at war with nature for its daily sustenance.  Next to that it<br>
	is quite insignificant whether some individuals find that the<br>
	values of a technological society--speed, ease, mass information,<br>
	mass access, and the like--are served and enhanced by such <br>
	machines.<br>
