<p>
Hardly anything is ever just what it seems, particularly where<br>
human psychology is concerned. But to answer your question: there<br>
are many reasons, of which I can explain two. First of all, many<br>
libertarians find nothing wrong with selfishness; when they "dress<br>
up" empathy as "somehow" selfish, this is how they *praise* empathy<br>
when addressing ethical egoists. I do this all the time.<br>
<p>
Secondly, many libertarians have the misfortune to come out of<br>
environments in which they were surrounded by greedy, selfish,<br>
parasitic human beings using demands on their "compassion", "empathy",<br>
and "altruism" as a means of extorting their property, and sometimes<br>
their very lifeblood and spirit, out of them. This is the case of<br>
Ayn Rand, whose family's situation was destroyed in the course of<br>
the Russian Revolution in the name of "compassion for the working<br>
class".<br>
<p>
For my own part, I would like to see the old tired dichotomy between<br>
egoism and altruism pass away from moral discourse. Any attempt to<br>
be consistent about either one immediately passes into a muddle of<br>
performative contradictions. The genealogical fact is that each<br>
and every one of my values, considered as a value, as a motivating<br>
information structure in my brain, was learned (or perhaps inherited?)<br>
by me from other human beings. *Not* learned by me from studying<br>
physical reality: the study of physical reality can inform, can<br>
produce new knowledge, and can motivate if given a context of<br>
preexisting values, but without a context of preexisting values,<br>
knowledge of physical reality does not motivate. Given that all my<br>
values have their origin in other human beings, it would be ridiculous<br>
for me to be insensitive to the presence of my deepest values within<br>
the minds of other people that I meet, and given that *my* most<br>
basic value is a simple joy and delight in Life...  well, perhaps<br>
I have an unfair advantage in the compassion department.<br>
<p>
So: my values come from others. But they're my values now, and what I<br>
do with them, what I transform them into, and how I give expression to<br>
them through my body-mind... as far as I'm concerned, that is the task<br>
at hand. I have no big answers nor any moral guidance to offer (in fact <br>
let me say this: don't trust me. Think for yourself.) but this is what<br>
I've come up with so far.<br>
<p>
Oh, yeah, here's a remark that's been floating around in my head lately,<br>
and now seems like an appropriate time to launch it. If you've been <br>
listening all your life to people who keep telling you to think about<br>
Reality, to face Reality, etc, it's good to keep in mind that Reality<br>
includes the contents of other people's heads.  "Downward causality"<br>
is empty eristic; the causality of rhetoric and psychology and culture<br>
is exactly the same kind of physical causality we know in other kinds<br>
of phenomena in the world. It's just that once a causal chain enters a<br>
human brain, you can forget about tracing it any further. You have to<br>
deal with that person as an independent agent. Some people can<br>
occasionally deceive themselves that this is not the case; one time<br>
honored method is to associate exclusively with one's intellectual<br>
inferiors so that one can use mind control on them. The fatal cost<br>
involved in this is the gradual erosion of the practitioner's<br>
mental skills as they become increasingly specialized in the study of the<br>
psychology of people who really have nothing of value to offer them.<br>
What I am describing, of course, is the psychology of the petty tyrant.<br>
We see these people all around us: secretive, sneaky, proud of their<br>
power, manipulative, and all of them, every last one, gradually growing<br>
weaker and stupider as a result of their practice.<br>
<p>
Fortunately, it is possible to change one's stripes.<br>
