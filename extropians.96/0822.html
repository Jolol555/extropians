<i>&gt;&gt;      fixed travel costs involved in face-to-face interactions.</i><br>

Ask youself: then why it is so much more expensive for people to live<br>
in urban areas?  The costs of getting gases, solids, fluids, etc. in<br>
rural areas may be a bit higher than in urban areas, but not by much<br>
(does WalMart charge more there?).  In contrast, the cost to get raw<br>
space is very large.  Why?  Because so many people want to be there<br>
for their jobs.  Why are the jobs there?  Sure some people need to be<br>
physcially present to run those pipes and delivery trucks, but not<br>
very many.  It seems it's mainly because companies show a strong<br>
preference for colocating their employees, and locating them near<br>
suppliers and customers, even when the physical cost to ship stuff is<br>
small.  Why?  It seems because people want to meet each in person a lot.<br>
<p>
I suggest you read a bit more urban economics before you so quickly<br>
dismiss this analysis by economics who I'm sure have read quite<br>
a bit of urban economics.<br>
