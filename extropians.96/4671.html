There has been talk occasionally about the stupidity of the masses on this<br>
list.  I would like to submit a point or two regarding the "stupidity of the<br>
masses".<br>
<p>
A lot of actions that people have deemed to be the "stupidity of the masses"<br>
are  usually stupid only in the larger context.  If you evaluate the<br>
individual decision of the individual person in the masses, the majority of<br>
people make an intelligent decision most of the time.  I believe it is<br>
possible for every individual to make an intelligent decision for<br>
themselves, but when every individual's intelligent decision is summed<br>
together, the net result for the population looks like a stupid decision.<br>
<p>
Selfishness is a leading example of this.  For most people in most<br>
situations, it is to their benefit to be very selfish.  There is nothing<br>
negative about maximizing your own well-being and material possessions.<br>
However, few people are wantonly selfish.  The meme has propagated that<br>
although being selfish in a local context may be smart, in the global or<br>
regional context it is a bad decision.  In this respect, good decisions in<br>
the larger context, aren't always smart decisions for people on an<br>
individual level and vice versa.<br>
<p>
To use the term "stupid masses" is unqualified in virtually any context.<br>
