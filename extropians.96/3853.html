<i>&gt; If you think the question of math people snooting it</i><br>
<i>&gt; over humanities people is private business between you and me </i><br>
<i>&gt; and not an extremely common and general phenomenon on the list, </i><br>
<i>&gt; well, you're wrong. </i><br>
<p>
How about some examples of this?  Far from being a common and <br>
general phenomenon, I don't think it happens at all.  <br>
<p>
In any case, I am much more of a humanities person than a math <br>
person.  It has been a long time since mathematics was my main <br>
interest.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you don't think that words (and setting an example) </i><br>
<i>&gt; have a physical, causal effect on human brains, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and if you don't think that it is human brains </i><br>
<i>&gt; (all six billion of them) that run the world,  ... </i><br>
<p>
I don't deny for a minute that words have effects on brains, nor that <br>
brains "run the world" (although both these statements need to be <br>
qualified).  The question is what kind of causality is involved here.  <br>
I'm driving at something.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are the one who brought private business onto the list, </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the paragraph I've quoted above.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, a pattern seems to be developing, in which I write a private <br>
message which hurts your feelings, and the next day you make a <br>
comment on the list about my having no sense of humor, or not <br>
understanding rhetoric -- comments which are at most tangentially <br>
relevant to what I said on the list, but very relevant to what I said to you <br>
privately.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd like an apology. </i><br>
<p>
Slave boys get no apologies.  &lt;g&gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Believe it or not, Lyle, you are not the center of the universe.  </i><br>
<p>
Not yet.  &lt;evil g&gt; <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
