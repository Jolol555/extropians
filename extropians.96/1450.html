this trend, I see a huge blob of silico/organic _living_ matter where<br>
once there was an earth.<br>

Ecology is not at all the image that I got: It sounds more like a<br>
monoculture, a grey goo, to me.<br>
<p>
Paul Di Filippo's 1995 story, "Distributed Mind" (first published in<br>
Interzone but also included in Di Filippo's excellent "Ribofunk"<br>
anthology), describes an intelligent, but benevolant 'grey goo' that<br>
takes over the Earth.<br>
<p>
I can't resist giving a flavor for Di Filippo's marvellous new<br>
vocabulary (for those who don't read fiction anymore ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Greenlaw was one of the few members of his cohort gestated and birthed</i><br>
the old-fashioned baseline way.  neither Incyte Yoot Chutes nor splice<br>
hostmothers ... at an extreme disadvantage, compared to his already<br>
wetwired, chomskied peers.... To escape the lite-servo class he had<br>
been born into and finance further trope doses that he hoped would lead<br>
to a good job in the symbol-analysis class, he was forced to rent out<br>
his personal wetware ... in an online pool ... leading to a brief<br>
flirtation with the Plus-Fourierists ...<br>
<p>
Wild mocklife had devored Greenlaw's native bioregion ... His proxies<br>
and splices ... his semisentient splinters and shards and snippets which<br>
had been unable to scatter themselves safely elsewhere across the<br>
telecosm ... Gone, all gone. yet still mockingly there ... simulacra<br>
transfigured by the mass of rogue silicrobes as the Urblastema or ...<br>
the Panplasmodaemonium.&lt;<br>
<p>
There's more, though it is a short story.  Di Filippo ends up raising<br>
many of the same questions that Hans Moravec does in a recent essay<br>
about pattern identity (that you can find a link to from Ander's<br>
Transhuman page).  Basically it's the same message that Moravec had in<br>
_Mind Children_:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Pattern identity ... defines the essence of a person ... as the pattern</i><br>
and the process going on in my head and body, not the machinery<br>
supporting that process.  If the process is preserved, I am preserved.<br>
The rest is mere jelly.&lt;<br>
<p>
I like the pattern identity meme, but I'm not quite ready to dismiss the<br>
physical world as "mere jelly."<br>
<p>
In this essay, Moravec goes on to add:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;if the subjective feeling of a person are part of the person-message,</i><br>
and the evolution of the message is implicit in the message itself,<br>
then aren't the future experiences of the person implicit in the<br>
message? And wouldn't this mathematical existence feel the same to the<br>
person encoded as being simulated in a more substantial way?  I don't<br>
think this is mere sophistry, but I'm not prepared to take it any<br>
further for now.&lt;<br>
<p>
Hummm... If that "huge blob of silico/organic _living_ matter", that<br>
"teeming, feasting soup" is really a giant computer capable of<br>
supporting billions of 'virtual machines', is it really a monoculture or<br>
an ecology of minds?<br>
