It could also be expected of those with enough serious interest to<br>
partcipate and support the list, to take those extra minutes to<br>
browse/filter out what they are interested in... <br>
<p>
Many threads that are interesting to you (or me, or anyone), originated from<br>
threads you never followed, intitiated by people you may not want on this<br>
list, do you want to miss out on these ? <br>
<p>
If there are people who want to limit the number of people on this list, i<br>
suggest they mail the people they want to directly...   <br>
