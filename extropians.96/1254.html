<i>&gt; &gt;are you suggesting the universe includes 'untrue'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or non-existent things?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The *universe* consists of all things that have existed across</i><br>
<i>&gt; space-time, some of which once existed but no longer do.  What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; status of these in the 'monochrome' view?</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  I should have phrased my question differently.  I would <br>
define things that 'used to be' and 'could be, but aren't yet' as <br>
'facts' - they're just facts we may not be aware of at the moment.  <br>
Don't you agree?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;we cannot see more than facts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;At most, we can *imagine* (not 'see') non-existent things [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Imagination is a wonderfully useful tool, but  [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It's nothing more than the ability to construct hypothetical models</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And what else is our seeing or hearing, based as it is upon limited</i><br>
<i>&gt; spectrums with  lots of 'noise' to be filtered and ghosts of past</i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns to be fitted or dumped?</i><br>
<p>
'Limited spectrums' still employ photons, which exist.  'Noise' may <br>
obscure what we're trying to perceive, but that noise *exists* - it's <br>
not metaphysical or supernatural interference.  What we *see* exists.  <br>
The fact that what we see may require interpretation does not mean that <br>
we see non-existent things.  On the other hand, if I *imagine* a purple <br>
walrus, not a single photon is tracing a path from the sun to the walrus <br>
and into my eyes to be interpreted and registered in my brain.  Instead, <br>
I'm taking my memories of walruses and applying my memory of the color <br>
purple to it, to construct a hypothetical model.  I'm not 'seeing' a <br>
purple walrus in any sense that makes the purple walrus as much a 'fact' <br>
as things I perceive via the physical process of sight. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think Greg Burch's 9/25/96 comments Re: Are Conspiracies Stronger Than</i><br>
<i>&gt; Truth? are applicable to this thread as well:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "From my experience (1) perception and memory in such situations is</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely unreliable, even in disinterested witnesses, (2) mutliple</i><br>
<i>&gt; witnesses can influence each other's perceptions and memories subtly but</i><br>
<i>&gt; very strongly, (3) strongly-held "memories" "mutate" significantly over</i><br>
<i>&gt; time [snip]"</i><br>
<p>
These are good reasons to place *more* emphasis on drawing distinctions <br>
between fact and imagination, not less.  Of course we have to make an <br>
effort to interpret perception properly.  Giving up and equating all <br>
perception with pure imagination is not helpful.  Not everything that is <br>
uncertain is *equally* uncertain.<br>
