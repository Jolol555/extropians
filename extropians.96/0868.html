Disclaimer: This forward is _not_ meant as Alcor propaganda. Far <br>
from it. (Actually, I consider current bout of mutual name-calling on <br>
Cryonet extremely antiproductive, to say the very least). <br>
<p>
Nevertheless the fact of the purportedly first reversible crypreservation <br>
of a macroscopic organ (if indeed true) is pretty interesting, imo.<br>

Subject: SCI. CRYONICS announcement<br>
<p>
VISSER DEMONSTRATION &amp; LICENSING AGREEMENT<br>
<p>
Joint Announcement of Cryonics Institute and Alcor Life Extension Foundation<br>
<p>
RAT HEARTS REVIVED FROM LIQUID NITROGEN--this milestone in cryobiology has<br>
been confirmed at the Alcor facility during the week of Aug. 30-Sep. 4, 1996.<br>
<p>
The achievement was reported last year from the University of Pretoria, South<br>
Africa, by Michelle Olga Visser, who used a new cryoprotective agent (CPA).<br>
She also reported submitting a paper on the experiment to CRYOBIOLOGY, with<br>
three co-authors at her university, in December 1995.<br>
<p>
Mrs. Visser is Head of Research, Department of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of<br>
Medicine, University of Pretoria. She is a perfusionist by training and<br>
practice, working for the University hospital and also as an independent<br>
contractor. She is a Ph.D. candidate in cryobiology, whose studies include<br>
physiology and pharmacology. <br>
<p>
She has been doing research in organ cryopreservation for the last three<br>
years, after having started the first homograft bank in Pretoria eight years<br>
ago at her department. She set up this bank to store heart valves harvested<br>
for re-implantation, using standard cryo procedures (DMSO), and developed an<br>
interest in developing a method for organs.<br>
<p>
Her original report was met with general skepticism or indifference, and<br>
publication has apparently been delayed by requests for revisions. But<br>
Anatole Dolinoff, president of the Cryonics Society of France, suggested that<br>
Mrs. Visser get in touch with Robert Ettinger, and extensive discussions by<br>
e-mail followed. CI and Alcor invited her and her husband Siegfried to come<br>
to Arizona as our guests and demonstrate the Visser method with rat hearts.<br>
This was finally done, and we have seen first-hand the confirmation of this<br>
accomplishment--arguably the most important since 1948, when Jean Rostand<br>
froze frog sperm with glycerol.<br>
<p>
The Vissers were assisted in the Alcor building, in a lab used and lent by<br>
CryoSearch Inc., by biochemist Hugh Hixon and by other Alcor people including<br>
Rhonda Iacuzzo and Tanya Jones. Witnesses included Steve Bridge, Mike Perry,<br>
Robert and Mae Ettinger, Fred and Linda Chamberlain, David Pizer, Paul<br>
Garfield, Ralph Whelan, Brian Shock, Derek Ryan, and Mathew Sullivan. Fred<br>
and Linda also helped with some of the chores, including videotaping.<br>
<p>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS: It wasn't smooth going. The equipment was<br>
different than the Vissers were accustomed to, and some of it was not<br>
compatible; and human error is easy with small animal organs. There were<br>
several failures during several long days of work. But there were also two<br>
hearts that showed weak beating and one that showed strong beating, after<br>
rewarming from liquid nitrogen temperature. This is unequivocal proof that<br>
the Visser technique (at least as applied to rat hearts) is far superior to<br>
anything previously reported. <br>
<p>
Control hearts--immersed in liquid nitrogen in the same manner but not<br>
perfused--showed gross damage, including cracking, and no signs of life.<br>
<p>
Because of limitations of equipment, the hearts were kept in liquid nitrogen<br>
for only a half minute to a minute--but the temperature probe showed core<br>
temperature within a few degrees of that of liquid nitrogen, - 196 C or - 320<br>
F. Once such a temperature is reached, it is generally agreed that the length<br>
of time of storage does not matter. Mrs. Visser reports that the longest she<br>
has kept hearts in liquid nitrogen is 45 minutes, and these were successfully<br>
revived. Alcor personnel will be working to establish a reliable, routine<br>
experimental protocol, and will be storing rat hearts for longer periods.<br>
Cryonics Institute also plans to test longer term storage of various organs. <br>
<p>
BRAINS: For cryonics, results with brains are the most important. There are<br>
experimental and theoretical reasons to think the Visser method will work<br>
well with brains also. The CPA penetrates the blood-brain barrier.<br>
Preliminary experiments at Alcor with rat brains show normal appearance to<br>
the naked eye and under the light microscope (but we do not yet have<br>
micrographs). <br>
<p>
LIMITATIONS OF THIS REPORT: Pending journal publication of their paper, the<br>
authors do not want to publicize the identity of the CPA or other details of<br>
the procedure, or to discuss the mechanism of cryoprotection. Patents have<br>
been applied for, or soon will be, in South Africa and several other<br>
countries, by Cryopreservation Technologies cc, the South African corporation<br>
in which Mr. and Mrs. Visser are majority shareholders. <br>
<p>
CRYONICS LICENSING AGREEMENT: In return for help in funding their further<br>
research, the Vissers have given CI and Alcor exclusive license to use their<br>
present and future technology for cryonics purposes. This includes the right<br>
to sub-license. <br>
<p>
PERSONAL NOTES: The Vissers formed an excellent working relationship with<br>
Hugh Hixon--who impressed everyone with his resourcefulness in adapting<br>
equipment--as well as with other Alcor people including Rhonda Iacuzzo and<br>
Tanya Jones. The Vissers stayed with Mae and Bob Ettinger, and were pleasant,<br>
considerate, and extremely interesting guests. There were many long<br>
conversations on a variety of topics- especially between the Vissers and Mae,<br>
since Bob was often tied up with other duties. Mr. Visser, a consulting<br>
engineer, understands the Visser method<br>
thoroughly and acts as lab partner; he is also the main business person in<br>
the Vissers' company. Mrs. Visser, despite her amazing energy, drive, and<br>
perfectionism, is also kind and understanding.<br>
<p>
<p>
NON-CRYONICS RESEARCH: A priority of the Visser group is to pursue research<br>
with large animal organs, in preparation for transplant experiments, leading<br>
up to human cryogenic organ banking. There are reasons to believe there is a<br>
very large potential market for such technology--not only including such<br>
traditional transplant candidates as kidney, heart, liver, pancreas, corneas<br>
etc., but also limbs or digits, glands such as thyroid, and others.<br>
<p>
TIME HORIZONS: When Mrs. Visser has funding, she estimates 8 months to a year<br>
to prove pig organ transplants. After that, the time required to get<br>
permission for human clinical trials, and to run those trials, and then to<br>
get regulatory approval, depends on the country or countries of choice and<br>
other factors. All told, perhaps 3 to 5 years. The demand for transplants,<br>
and the life-saving nature of the technology, might expedite matters,<br>
compared to customary procedures.<br>
<p>
For 100% proof of reversible cryopreservation of the human brain, we know of<br>
no reliable way to make even a rough guess. It will take as long as it takes.<br>
But with the Visser method we have a running start--and it seems very<br>
possible that our cryonics patients will very soon have much better<br>
suspensions than any previously available. <br>
