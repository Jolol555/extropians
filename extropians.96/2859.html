<i>&gt;Chris, you're a guy.  Of course you think women look beautiful.</i><br>
<p>
Hahahaha. Duhh the obvious! :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think women </i><br>

may be <br>
<i>&gt;common among most males, is that I tend to look at women much more than I</i><br>
look <br>
<i>&gt;at men.  If I am passing a group of people, my mind seems to automatically </i><br>
<i>&gt;look for the women. I think that males' obsession with women causes us to</i><br>
see <br>
<i>&gt;them as more beautiful than men.</i><br>
<p>
A genetic/hormonal influence on our thinking?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also think that most men are very </i><br>
<i>&gt;reluctant to recognize the beauty of other men, since homophobia is so</i><br>
rampant <br>
<i>&gt;in our society.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with that earlier drag clothing comment. Men dress in drab clothing<br>
and the only men who don't usually aren't hetero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've allowed myself to recognize the beauty of other men, and I think that</i><br>
men <br>
<i>&gt;are as beautiful as women.  It is a different sort of beauty, a different </i><br>
<i>&gt;style, but I think both men and women are very beautiful.  It's a matter of </i><br>
<i>&gt;allowing yourself to see that.  And not being scared of unexpected emotions.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose we _can_ recognize the beauty of men without being attracted to them.<br>
