<i>&gt;Should we abolish the copyright law? If we say no it is against the anarchy</i><br>

I had always accepted the view that patents and copyrights were<br>
but the legitimate extension of property rights into the realm<br>
of 'ideal objects.' However, some arguments by Tom G. Palmer and<br>
Benjamin Tucker (among others), have convinced me that<br>
copyrights and patents are not forms of legitimate property<br>
rights, but of illegitimate state-granted monopoly.    <br>
<p>
These ideal objects are non-tangible economic goods. They<br>
include such constructs as ideas, databases, algorithms,<br>
computer programs, music, literature, etc. They differ from<br>
tangible property in that they can be infinitely multiplied<br>
without concomitant lessening of size or quality.  They remain<br>
economic goods in that they are scarce-someone must produce them<br>
and they are valuable.    <br>
<p>
Intellectual property rights in the US fall into several<br>
categories: patents, copyrights, and trade secrets for example.<br>
Trade secrets protect ideas but rely upon private measures, not<br>
state action, to maintain exclusivity.  This in contrast to the<br>
non-contractual protections characterizing patents and<br>
copyrights.     <br>
<p>
The 'publicness' of a good, which allows free-ridership, is not<br>
an inherent characteristic but a function of the manner it is<br>
produced, marketed, or even of the relevant unit in which the<br>
information is imbedded. Further, costs of exclusion are<br>
involved in the production of all the goods I can think of. Why<br>
single out some goods and insist the state underwrite their<br>
production costs via a state-sanctioned collective action, all<br>
because of the decision to make the good available on such a<br>
non-exclusive basis that it is converted from a potential<br>
private good into a public good.     <br>
<p>
Is it right to create property rights whenever the specter of<br>
freeridership arises? Magicians embed their intellectual good<br>
within illusions. To reveal the trick enables consumers to<br>
produce their own illusions. Yet, if they decide to appear on<br>
TV, some viewers might use the slo-mo feature of their VCR to<br>
'free-ride'. Should we create property rights in illusions and<br>
restrain VCR owners from using slow-motion?                     <br>
               <br>
Markets for ideal objects can and do function in the absence of <br>
enforceable intellectual property rights. Fashions, business<br>
strategies, scientific principles and math formulas, jokes,<br>
magic tricks, new words and slogans are all examples of ideal<br>
objects unprotected in the U.S.    Also works on which<br>
copyrights have expired or were never applicable (such as the<br>
Congressional testimony of Lt. Col. Oliver North).    <br>
<p>
In addition functioning markets existed for foreign authors in<br>
the U.S. in the 19th century. The free market paid royalties to<br>
British authors even though those authors received no copyright<br>
protection in the US until the extension of copyright protection<br>
to foreigners in 1891. The American publishers paid the royalty<br>
in order to obtain advance galleys, even though they themselves<br>
had no legal protection against competitors who could legally<br>
copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence of state<br>
protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and<br>
contractual arrangements for the internalization of<br>
externalities.    <br>
<p>
The problem shifts to being one of marketing. Although current<br>
publishers so used to operating with a copyright may think this<br>
analysis strikes at the foundations of the publishing biz, it is<br>
aimed at the present selling methods.<br>
<p>
American laws over intellectual property are rooted in the<br>
English patents and copyright system. The Crown issued patents<br>
for new inventions with the aim of securing control of endeavors<br>
thought to be of political import; or to raise money through the<br>
granting of monopolies. Copyright served to ensure state control<br>
over the press in an era of tremendous political and religious<br>
dissent. As Tom Palmer remarked in his recent paper on<br>
Intellectual Property, "Monopoly privilege and censorship lie at<br>
the historical root of patent and copyright." Many times the<br>
state granted monopoly privilege with no concern for the<br>
original inventor. Venice in 1469 (One of the earliest patents I<br>
could find) granted to John of Spyer a monopoly over the art of<br>
printing itself. Queen Marys' chartering of the Company of<br>
Stationers in 1557, granting its monopoly over printing, was an<br>
attempt to control a new, threatening technology, primarily to<br>
suppress Protestantism.     <br>
<p>
I stress here I do not condemn the current theoretical arguments<br>
for intellectual property rights on the basis of its'<br>
unwholesome historical origin. I point out its' genesis to<br>
counter the myth that patents and copyrights arose from the<br>
mists of historical common law.                     <br>
<p>
Any service or good has, as a component of its' cost of<br>
production, not only the costs of labor, marketing, capital,<br>
etc., but also the cost of exclusion. For the owner of a movie<br>
theater, these exclusion costs include paying for walls, ticket<br>
windows, ushers. These serve to exclude or fence out<br>
'freeriders'. Now they could set up projectors and show the<br>
movies on low level stratus clouds (ok, screens in parks), and<br>
then attempt to prevent casual passerbys from watching. The<br>
method of marketing their product is their choice. In the case<br>
where their marketing decision results in the publicness of a<br>
good, it seems to me to be grossly unjust to ask the government<br>
to force all who might potentially see the show without paying<br>
to kick in some bucks, whether they DO in fact see the show or<br>
not. Or to force passerbys to don glasses that prevent them from<br>
viewing the movie. Yet the proponents of property rights in<br>
ideas choose such a method when they attempt to get every person<br>
purchasing a blank tape to pay a royalty to a third party.<br>
Alternatively, as with DAT tape recorders, their proposals seek<br>
to ban or cripple entire technologies. This method, done in the<br>
name of preventing technologies which are capable of recording<br>
publicized (broadcast) music without loss of fidelity, would<br>
make mere ownership of tangible property (DAT recorder) a crime.<br>
I view proposals for such an implementation of property rights<br>
in ideas, which wipe out other areas of property rights<br>
altogether, as inconsistent.<br>
<p>
If we privatize the enforcement of contracts, let those who want<br>
to "own" ideas pay for the enforcement of that contract.  Market<br>
forces will probably lead the computer programmer to tie a<br>
perceived value to the registration of their program (cheap upgrades,<br>
technical support, etc.); rather than paying for a protection agency<br>
that tries to police the digital information realm.  But they would<br>
be welcome to try to enforce a contract against copying a program<br>
that the purchaser would sign when he buys the product.  I just<br>
wouldn't subscribe to a protection agency that used some of my<br>
subscription fee to police copyright protection.<br>
