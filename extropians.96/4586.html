<i>&gt; While my views might be considered somewhat extreme, I think the term </i><br>
<i>&gt; science has been somewhat debased in the past decades. Not willing to </i><br>
<i>&gt; revive the dead and rotten (and good riddance) physics&amp;lyrics thread, </i><br>
<i>&gt; science, regrettably, is not a (tm), alas. Absurd combinations like </i><br>
<i>&gt; "christian science" and "domestic science" etc. prove my point. Imho, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the term science (probably accompanied by the "hard" epithet) should be </i><br>
<i>&gt; reserved for mathematics and physics alone, secondary sciences (e.g. </i><br>
<i>&gt; chemistry, molecular biology, etc.), then medicine, social sciences, </i><br>
<i>&gt; historical sciences (archeometry is an exact science, though) etc. only </i><br>
<i>&gt; following after.</i><br>
<p>
While I may sympathize with the degradation of the word "science", I<br>
don't see the cognitive value of this definition.  True, medicine is<br>
based on top of biology, which sits atop chemistry, which all comes<br>
down to physics, but to give physics some fundamental respect that it<br>
is a difference in kind rather than just subject matter requires an<br>
intrinsicist leap of faith that an honest scientist must reject.  True,<br>
it may be the lowest coneptual level we currently can measure, but why<br>
treat it as something "fundamental", when there may be a thousand levels<br>
below what we currently call "physical law"?  If all of our perceptions<br>
at each of these levels is reported honestly, and our integrations of<br>
those perceptions are tested empirically; subjected to criticism,<br>
review, and repetition; and our conclusions and predictions strictly<br>
limited to those tested results, then we are performing science.  It<br>
is the process that is valuable, and should be defined, respected, and<br>
applied to whatever subject matter our perceptions find to apply it.<br>
<p>
And mathematics serves an entirely different function--it is purely a<br>
creation of cognition.  Any attachment of mathematical models to "reality"<br>
takes one out of the realm of math.  There is no such thing as an<br>
empirical test of mathematics, whereas empirical results are the very<br>
foundation of science.  Most sciences use mathematics as a tool to<br>
understand and generalize from the empirical data, but such is not<br>
science, or else we would still be Newtonians.  The mathematics of<br>
Newtonian mechanics were clean and beautiful and matched perfectly our<br>
empirical evidence up to QM, but the fact that scientists modified it<br>
in light of QM came from the conviction that empirical evidence against<br>
it in quantum situations could not be rationally ignored.  In other words,<br>
it came from science: the refusal to evade reality.<br>
<p>
To create greater respect for good, honest, science, your distraction<br>
with subject matter serves no purpose.  Perceptions--the best of which<br>
are quantitative measurements, of course--at the medical/biological<br>
level are no less real than perceptions at the quantum level.  Science<br>
is nothing more or less than the conviction that we should use those<br>
perceptions as the final arbiter of what we choose to carry in our<br>
consciousness as our mental model of the world.  Respect for science<br>
comes from that conviction, and from the integrity of those practicing<br>
it, not from the subject matter to which we apply it.<br>
<p>
Things like "Creation Science" are an abomination precisely because<br>
they use faulty epistemology and backwards methodology--straining the<br>
interpretations of perception beyond the breaking point to justify<br>
pre-written conclusions from non-empirical sources.  "Domestic Science",<br>
on the other hand might be real science or not, depending on what is<br>
actually taught.  If it teaches things like leaving avocado pits in<br>
your guacamole to keep it green, or searing meat to "seal in juices"<br>
or other easily disproven nonsense, then it deserves derision.  If, on<br>
the other hand, it teaches proper respect for repeatable, measurable,<br>
results and just happens to use cooking as the subject matter, then it<br>
is a true science and deserves respect as such.  If you make several<br>
batches of guacamole, label them randomly, then leave instructions for<br>
a friend to take them from the fridge and show them to another friend,<br>
letting him judge objective criteria like color, texture, saltiness,<br>
etc., then you are a scientist no less than Feynmann at the particle<br>
accelerator.<br>
<p>
Subject-snobbery will do more harm than good to respect for science.<br>
