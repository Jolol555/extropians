Yes, but do you know what that gene therapy does? It changes *one* gene<br>
making *one* protein. We do not even understand how relatively trivial<br>
processes such as self assembly, cytotransport, morphogenesis and<br>
neuro-immune contact work (although we are learning). What you propose is<br>
roughly to create a customized multicellular lifeform, able to do neural<br>
computation *much* better and faster than ordinary neurons, and able to<br>
live and develop in the human brain without disturbing it. That is very<br>
far from setting a genetic switch or fixing a bad gene. <br>

<p>
Yes, in a way. But I'm not betting on genetics, I'm betting on both. If <br>
we get nano, we will get the genetics part soon enough, and genetics may <br>
turn out the be the easiest way towards nano. I look forward to both.<br>
<p>
What I object to is your claim that this bio-uploading is simpler than <br>
doing it with nano; both proposals are very hard and will require <br>
enormous advances. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Using some kind of virus </i><br>

<i>&gt; How could you upload by rebuilding neurons from the inside? Eat alot of</i><br>

<i>&gt; brain into circuit boards? hehe</i><br>
<p>
:-) No, what I was thinking of was using something like a rabies virus, <br>
that spreads from synapse to synapse, and instead of killing the cell <br>
turning them into a part of your uploading organism from the inside <br>
instead of from the outside.<br>
<p>
Wild idea: instead of trying to replace the cells, lets destroy them! The<br>
uploading virus/nanite spreads through the brain, infecting each cell. <br>
Inside the cell, it somehow records the relevant information: it creates<br>
an unique code for the cell, places markers with it on the synaptic<br>
surfaces, records which markers synapse on the cell (and other relevant<br>
information). Finally, it creates a protein that contains this information<br>
and waits for a chemical signal. After a while, the uploader injects an<br>
artificial hormone, that tells the viruses/nanites to scramble. They<br>
produce more of the encoding proteins and tear down the cell. The brain<br>
turns to mush, which is emptied into a chemical computer that sorts out<br>
the proteins and builds a model of the mind, which is finally run on a<br>
digital computer. <br>
<p>
Uploading though letal disease, anyone? :-)<br>
