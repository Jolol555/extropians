<i>&gt;Marx said "The point is not to understand the world, but to change it."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;This puts the cart before the horse.  The correct procedure is as follows:  </i><br>
<i>&gt;First one uses philosophy to ascertain the nature of the world; *then* </i><br>
<i>&gt;one decides what should or should not be done.  </i><br>
<p>
That doesn't work either.  Even if we knew what is true, there isn't<br>
any defensible way to infer from that what should be done.  To make<br>
such an inference, one would have to have a reasonable inference rule<br>
of the form "if X is true, then you should do Y"; I don't know of any<br>
such inference rules that are universally accepted.  Suggestions are<br>
welcome.  In the absence of such suggestions, Max's approach of<br>
advocating doing things seems as good as anything.<br>
<p>
However, I agree with you that he should not purport to measure things<br>
without having a procedure that generates a number.  IMO he's really<br>
peddling a value system; the religious right has "family values", and<br>
we have analogous but different "extropian values", except Max calls<br>
the extropian values "principles".  <br>
