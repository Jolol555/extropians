In a message dated 96-10-17 22:24:10 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; that <br>
 what we call the "govt" is merely a MASK of the mega-wealthy who want<br>
 to gain market control via mechanism other than consumer selection.<br>
 Whatever grows the govt, gives more power to a core mega-wealthy cabal. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
To the mega wealthy the fastest way to steal, Woops!  I'm sorry, I mean MAKE<br>
a profit is to get a new law passed such as the "propositions" in California.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Have you see Prop.  211?  This opens the doors for law suits not let into in<br>
Federal courts. Its being "sold" to the elderly as a "save-our-pensions" law<br>
by some businesses that stand to profit from the new law.   Not customer<br>
driven win-win.   <br>
<p>
The elderly might lose their pensions by paying to save their pensions.  The<br>
businesses probably see creating new laws that favor new business for them as<br>
good creative marketing and a public service.  <br>
<p>
I could be wrong about this Proposition 211, but I get suspicious when a law<br>
is SURE to "help" me.  <br>
