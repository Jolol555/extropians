I've seen that many people on the list are into forms of art that are<br>
bizarre yet beautiful such as H.R Giger, and M. C. Escher. It will be<br>
incredible what breakthrough artists such as these and others will be able<br>
to accomplish with new technologies creating entire full scale virtual<br>
worlds or universes with virtual reality tech coming in the near future.<br>
I've suddenly become in awe of the ideal mix of artist and engineer. We<br>
don't need one or the other, we require both. There isn't a duality. I've<br>
come to this conclusion recently being entranced with the music by Loreena<br>
McKennitt in "the mask and the mirror". You can get it at any Natural<br>
Wonders store. Anyone into those artists meantioned above should definately<br>
checkout this music. I never realized that art played such an integral role<br>
in defining our future. I wonder how art will be at the turn of the<br>
millenium? Evolving art that mutates and evolves according to our sense of<br>
asthetics?<br>
