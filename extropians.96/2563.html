<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;There can be many instances of a single brain, each with its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;own consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I beleive that there is a significant difference between copying a</i><br>
<i>&gt; conciousness, which operates independently of a root conciousness, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gradual process of gradually copying one's various files one at a time,</i><br>
<i>&gt; verifying operability, and then transfering processing tothe new file</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the old, and deleting the old.  This would maintain the individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; stream of conciousness, while the first, in the instance of destructive</i><br>
<i>&gt; copying, would not, relative to the original wetware. When we talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt; stream of conciousness, we need to maintain that this is relative to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original copy.  It does not matter if the original copy shuts down for</i><br>
<i>&gt; defragging once a day, it is still itself because it only copied and</i><br>
<i>&gt; erased minute fractions of its conciousness at any one time, and we know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a human can operate with a significant loss of brain capacity, just</i><br>
<i>&gt; not with a total loss, although facetiously, I can think of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; congressmen who seem to be doing just fine.</i><br>
<p>
I believe incremental replacement of individual brain components is <br>
completely feasible.  After all, the brain is a fault-tolerant, error <br>
correcting design.  This would be the easy part though.  Extending an <br>
architecture never designed to be extended would be a much more <br>
difficult pursuit.  Beyond simple component for component <br>
replacement, high level architectural augmentation should be extremely <br>
difficult.<br>
