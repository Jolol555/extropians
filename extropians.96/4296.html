Romana posits various formulations of her re-defintion that avoid that<br>
E-prime naughty word, "is", and concludes that, so put, her attempt<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;doesn't seem any worse than Max's Extropy #17 definition . . . .</i><br>
<p>
That depends on what you mean by "any worse".  Max's definition clearly aims<br>
at something functionally equivalent to "is".  In that sense, using a colon<br>
or a dictionary format "doesn't seem any worse", I suppose.  <br>
<p>
But, to set aside such trivialities for more substantive concerns, I do think<br>
Romana's defintion is "worse" in that, for reasons I have set forth<br>
elsewhere, it does a worse job of setting forth the necessary and sufficient<br>
attributes of "Extropy".<br>
