<i>&gt; &gt; I am personally disgusted with people who keep claiming </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that the Holocaust never happened. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that lies are nauseating.  The question of *who* is lying  </i><br>
<i>&gt; remains to be determined. </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are two explanations for the disappearance of European Jewry...</i><br>
<p>
Up until this point, I was with you, but you have departed from the<br>
rational.  The proper response to Mr. Lorrey's remark above is "Please<br>
confine yourself to the question at hand; no one is denying the<br>
Holocaust, I am arguing against one small point, and nothing else."<br>
<p>
But instead, you offer an irrational and inflammatory response that<br>
does not support your reasoning.  And then to claim that it's<br>
possible that the number of missing is overestimated by millions<br>
flies squarely in the face of clear evidence.<br>
<p>
I offer you the same advice I offer Mr. Lorrey: confine your<br>
arguments to the question given.  Were Jews killed in gas chambers<br>
or by some other means?  As you demonstrate, the evidence for such<br>
chambers is unsatisfying, but to extrapolate from that to cast<br>
doubt upon the number of deaths itself is every bit as irrational<br>
as Mr. Lorrey's emotional outbursts.<br>
<p>
Also, let me offer another possible form of evidence more solid<br>
than mere eyewitness testimony: corroboration.  Are there accounts<br>
from witnesses, who have never met, taken separately, that agree on<br>
details significant enough to make chance coincidence unlikely?  Is<br>
there corroborative testimony from parties on both sides (i.e. from<br>
Germans who may have built or operated the chambers)?  While that<br>
still isn't blueprints or photographs, it might make Shermer's weak<br>
arguments quite a bit stronger.<br>
