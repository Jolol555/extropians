It seems that Mr. Brin is remarkably thin skinned, even my gentile ribbing <br>
enraged him, as I said before, I've never seen anger like this when one is <br>
able to make a coherent argument in a debate, and I've been in a few. <br>
Mr. Brin can dish it out but he can't take it.<br>
<p>
This will just be a short post as there is very little substance to respond <br>
to. It's a pity you're limited by ASCII, capital letters just aren't good <br>
enough, perhaps if you could write your insults in a larger typeface your <br>
argument for a "Transparent Society" would be more logical.                   <br>

Apparently you have person experience in this matter. Which side of the  <br>
interrogation table were you on? <br>

Shouting never saved a single Jew in Nazi Germany, phony ID cards did.<br>

Libertarians are quite willing to leave you alone, all we ask is that you  <br>
return the courtesy.<br>
