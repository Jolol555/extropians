<i>&gt; I think you are correct, this need to be done - but for a creative person to</i><br>

<i>&gt; state that I try to avoid! </i><br>
<p>
	I agree that finding reasons and purpose sometimes takes the<br>
spirit and mystery out of certain experiences.  But I think that it is a<br>
great act of self-discipline and control to be able to bend, warp and<br>
otherwise manipulate ones mind in such a manner.  To realize meaning, and<br>
then consciously impose ignorance for a given time in order to achieve<br>
your ends, this takes great skill, and anyone that can exhibit that much<br>
self-knowledge and control commands respect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are some great books out on this subject, one called FLOW byt a guy</i><br>
<i>&gt; whos name I cannot even spell.. something with a lot of consonsants paul</i><br>
<i>&gt; Czwzewjkz??(help- whats his name?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; ;- )</i><br>
<p>
	I'll have to look into that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hyperanalytical, thinking too concretely about the process, wondering about</i><br>
<i>&gt; neural networking of my brain - writing about it.  Interferes with flow.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most creative people don;t usually have time for detailed chemical studies of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own brain- it's hard to think about that while painting... ;- )</i><br>
<p>
	But the point is to be able to step back for a moment, analyze<br>
what is occuring, discover a way to improve upon the experience, take the<br>
action, then continue on normally.  As a practical example, if one is<br>
using dietary supplements they don't generally monitor the levels of<br>
ascorbic acid in their bodies at every moment of the day.  What happens is<br>
they may go through an trial period, maybe even monitor the levels<br>
frequently for a while (though this generally isn't the case) and find out<br>
what works best.  Get on a schedule for supplementing at the optimum<br>
times.  You don't have to think about it until the time comes that you<br>
have to take your pills, otherwise you are completely oblivious to it.  <br>
	If you find a way to enhance the experience of "creative bliss"<br>
you should only have to analyze it for a very short time, or once, learn<br>
what works, what doesn't, then just use the standard new improved method<br>
and go about your business.  You don't have to think about it while you<br>
are painting, because you have already done the work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now if you find out what this is, access it chemically and make a smart drug</i><br>
<i>&gt; for non artists to join us in our bliss and flow, that would be lovely! But I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a hint for you - best way to make a muscle grow is to exercise it. </i><br>
<p>
	I do and fully intend to continue, but I think that it is in the<br>
spirit of extropy to find improved methods to expand ones mind, to make it<br>
better, enhance it.  Why go with brute force and stay within the limits<br>
when you can use intellect to overcome and trancend them?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would be happy to partake in a study like this but not to talk too much</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it..</i><br>
<i>&gt; Life is too long, and there are pixels,scultures, oils, and designs that need</i><br>
<i>&gt; my attention!</i><br>
<p>
	I feel that if you don't sacrifice just a bit of time in<br>
forethought that the time will come when you can no longer paint those<br>
paintings or rearrange those pixels.  A small sacrifice now may have an<br>
avalanche of benefits later.<br>
<p>
P.S.-I hope you don't think that was hostile or such, I don't intend it<br>
to be. I fully appreciated your response and respect it immensely.  <br>
