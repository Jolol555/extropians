        For Christ's sake Chris!  Did you not read my "Paradise In A<br>
Paradox" post?  Any kind of 'attack' be it through media or brainwashing<br>
is still an attack.  If we are to carry out the meme spreading in the way<br>
that (it seems) you intend, we'll either have people totally exposed to<br>
extropy, or minions --I don't think we want that now do we?  It's like<br>
throwing a Bible in someone's face and saying "if you don't read this,<br>
you'll be struck dead by God."  I prefer libertarianism over a dictatorship<br>
domination, thank you.  Don't take this as a flame --it's not-- but it looks<br>
more like brainwashing if you do it this way.  Your post has undertones of<br>
"youd better conform to *our* ways because *we* are right".  No.  Extropy is<br>
not God, and entropy is not the Devil.  Extropy is no religion, and should<br>
not be viewed as one.  Take my "Paradise In A Paradox" out of the trash if<br>
you want to see my views and possible solutions.<br>
