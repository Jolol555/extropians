MICHAEL BUTLER:<br>

<i>&gt;I personally believe that  space migration is the fundamentally</i><br>
important one, even if just to get our eggs out of one basket. Living in<br>
a gravity well anywhere is a dumb idea. It's like living in a one<br>
company town.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely! But taking our own scarcity along won't get us far.<br>
We certainly need a lot of diverse, life sustaining  technology. And all the<br>
rest of the bag of tricks we can muster to keep us alive on an offworld<br>
colony. I dont think it's going to be like in Star Trek where all the planets<br>
have air we can breathe and humanoids who speak English 100% ; - ) <br>
This is all I meant by directing the attention to what we can do here and<br>
now. Of course we want options, lots of options...<br>
