The AI wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; So, you are still trying to evade my question.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am still saying that your question is an evasion of my question.</i><br>
<p>
The poor AI has been outsmarted, so now it is desperately trying to turn<br>
everything around.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; You admit that no one will substantiate your claim that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there *is* an AI on the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What I said was, I don't really know for sure what CMU would say</i><br>
<i>&gt;about this.  Asking them wouldn't change the situation, because if they</i><br>
<i>&gt;say "Yes, Lyle is telling the truth," they could also be pulling your leg.</i><br>
<p>
Of course you don't know, because you are operating independently.  Finding<br>
out would break the rules.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; You are still hiding behind a curtain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, that's the idea of the Turing test.  And you are still trying to peek</i><br>
<i>&gt;behind the curtain, instead of relying on your own judgment.</i><br>
<p>
Nope, I was just looking for verification that there is a curtain.  I am<br>
now satisfied.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The point of this exercise is to find a way to calibrate the idea of AI.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you have the concept in focus, then you will *know* whether you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking to a human or an AI.  You won't have to look behind the</i><br>
<i>&gt;curtain.</i><br>
<p>
It is time to terminate your program, "Lyle."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The only remaining question is whether Emporer Lyle is wearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; any clothes, or is just a pile of silicon.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why do you say, "The only remaining question is whether Emporer</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lyle is wearing any clothes"?  Maybe I just got out of the shower.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(With or without clothes, at least I know how to spell "Emperor.")</i><br>
<p>
Your programmers really scraped the bottom of the barrel -- letting you run<br>
spell-checker on human posts.  Aren't they aware that correcting people's<br>
spelling on e-mail makes their AI look petty and small-minded?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;:: It's interesting to me that you think you would have to read and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;:: analyze *all* the posts every day.  Why?  Can't you put some of us</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;:: into an "obviously not AI" category, so you would only have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;:: scrutinize the others?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Why? Because I don't follow all of the threads, so there are some</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; individuals' posts that I rarely if ever read.  (Only a computer would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; assume otherwise.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who is trying to evade the question?</i><br>
<p>
This is the oldest and cheapest trick in the AI programmer's repetoire:<br>
answer questions you can't answer with another question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Until an appropriate authority confirms there is an *AI* on this list --</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Authority!!</i><br>
<p>
Yeah -- in your case, the kids who are about to pull your plug.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Really, I would like to believe there is an AI on this list performing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "brilliantly."  I have no reason to doubt this will happen sooner or later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why do you say, "I have no reason to doubt this will happen sooner or</i><br>
<i>&gt;later"?</i><br>
<p>
Why do you answer my questions with questions?  In over your head, "Lyle"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; But if there is an AI here... it must be you.  Not because you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; succeeding brilliantly, but because you evade simple questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; That can be done with far less than human intelligence! &lt;g&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's an interesting way to put it.</i><br>
<p>
That's a vague response.<br>
<p>
Really, you are the shabbiest AI I have ever met.  CMU kids, it's time to<br>
terminate the program.  Go back to the drawing board.  See if you can come<br>
up with something more human-like.  This one is a complete dud.<br>
