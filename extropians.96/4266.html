<p>
While I welcome intelligent attempts to better undertand "Extropy", whether<br>
through redescribing it or redefining it, let's not make any mistake that<br>
Romana proposed to do solely the latter.  Her original header re-appears<br>
above.  Note its use of "definition".  Moreover, recall that she had written:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Extropy *is* the quality of creative order characteristic of living systems.</i><br>
<p>
(emphasis added)<br>
<p>
As E-prime advocates note, using "is" implies equivalence.  To so define a<br>
term delimits its scope, and thus does a great deal more than a mere<br>
description.  A description, in contrast to a definition, merely lists some<br>
of many possible attributes of a subject.<br>
<p>
By way of example, consider the difference between "Mary is a crook," and<br>
"Mary took some bread."  The former defines Mary as one of a whole class of<br>
people, ascribing to her all of their common vices.  The latter merely<br>
describes one of her acts, thus leaving room for Mary to embody a good many<br>
attributes not common to thieves generally.<br>
<p>
In brief, one ought to take definitions--and re-definitions--very, very<br>
seriously.  Descriptions matter much less.<br>
