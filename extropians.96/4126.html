<i>&gt;&gt;I answered this above.  In the short term, the paranoids and aynrandroids</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;will win.  But if I am right, maturity will prevail in the long run.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Like David Brin, I consider myself a pragmatist. My trust is earned because</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is too expensive to give away. Trusting in the maturity and self-respect</i><br>
<i>&gt;of others on such a sweeping scale is beyond me. I applaud Brin's ambition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;genrosity, and optimism.</i><br>
<p>
Honey, you have *really* got the intellectual judo thing down! I was <br>
contemplating writing a nasty reply to Brin's little bit of smarmy, <br>
disingenuous, John-Lennon-esque political propaganda, but the tack you <br>
took was, I think, much more effective in the ears of the people who<br>
count.<br>
<p>
And it was great to see you at the party. Nietzsche wrote that in<br>
the end it is our desires and not their objects that we love, but<br>
if this is really so, then the people we love best are those few<br>
rare people who can still make us feel truly desirous on many levels<br>
at once. As you made me feel Saturday night.  ;)<br>
