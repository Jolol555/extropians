          <br>
          This is an important issue, but not one that is easily <br>
          settled by a few short mailings. Let's begin by trying to <br>
          make sure we understand what you mean.<br>
          <br>
          Is your idea roughly this: That the values humans have are <br>
          relatively constant, or, to the extent the vary, are largely <br>
          determined by social and cultural factors; and that <br>
          therefore the most significant determinant of the behaviour <br>
          of powerful agents is the societal framework in which they <br>
          live and act?<br>
          <br>
          If this is your idea, and if it is true of the world today, <br>
          then we may go on to see whether or not a world with &gt;AI <br>
          etc. would be different in any way that would make the <br>
          statement less true in such a world.<br>
          <br>
          (Please tell me if this is off the mark, for I have as yet <br>
          very little knowledge of the social sciences.)<br>
