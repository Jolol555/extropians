} More seriously, I think the Snow Crash meme/religion/consciousness idea <br>
} is intriguing, even if I don't believe in it. Religion doesn't seem to <br>
} help cognition much, but helps provide an emotional framework. Maybe we <br>
} should see it as an early and somewhat odd cognitive tool?<br>
<p>
I've started studying linguistics, and started with Ernst Cassirer's<br>
_Language and myth_ on the grounds that it was short.  I think that he<br>
was saying linguistic and mythological development were somewhat linked<br>
in the 'discovery' of concepts and classes.  Myth starts with isolated<br>
events and things that awe the viewer; moves to somewhat generalized<br>
functional gods (god of first plowing, god of sowing, god of second<br>
plowing); and thence to more personal and anthromoporphized gods.<br>
Actually I don't think I can well-represent the other side of his<br>
argument, so I won't mutilate it, but considering how animist I was as a<br>
child while considering myself atheist, I wouldn't be shocked if<br>
something religion-like was a part of breaking up the world into things<br>
to perceive.<br>
