Okay, I've taken a look at the Lorrey drive, and I've found what appears<br>
to be a gaping mechanical flaw.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Imagine a centrifugal drum, like that seen edge on in the animation</i><br>
<i>&gt; below. If you had several masses in the drum, rotating around the</i><br>
<i>&gt; geometric center, they would all produce equal centrifugal force at</i><br>
<i>&gt; every point in their orbits, so you would essentially have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; workings of a gyroscope. However, if you were able to speed each</i><br>
<i>&gt; mass up at one point in the orbit, and slow it down again on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposite side of the centrifuge, you would have a point in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; centrifuge where all masses were going slowly on that side, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast on the opposite side. This would produce excess centrifugal</i><br>
<i>&gt; force in a direction straight out from the point of highest velocity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; you would also impose a large amount of torque on the drum and</i><br>
<i>&gt; chassis of the device.</i><br>
<p>
  Positions    |   Velocities    |  Accelerations<br>
   _______     |     _______     |     _______     <br>
 /    A    \   |   /    A-&gt;  \   |   /   &gt;A    \   <br>
/         B \  |  / ^       B \  |  /     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;B \  <br>
\ D         /  |  \ D       V /  |  \ D&gt;&gt;       /   <br>
 \    C    /   |   \  &lt;-C    /   |   \   &gt;C    /    <br>
   ^^^^^^^     |     ^^^^^^^     |     ^^^^^^^       <br>
<p>
Take a mass M, weighing one gram.  M goes around in the centrifuge<br>
shown.  At D, M travels at 5 meters/second, at B, 10 meters/second.  At<br>
A, M is pushed forward by an extra 5 m/s and at C, M is slowed by 5 m/s.<br>
<p>
The total system, including the centrifuge, works like this.  Start at A<br>
before M is accelerated, assuming the whole device to have zero<br>
momentum.  At A, M is pushed forward by 5 m/s.  This transfers<br>
-5gm/s of momentum to the centrifuge.  M goes around the centrifuge<br>
through B, coming out at C going -10 m/s instead of 10, transferring 20<br>
gm/s of momentum to the centrifuge.  M is then slowed down at C,<br>
transferring another -5gm/s to the centrifuge.  M then goes from C to A<br>
through D, going from -5m/s to 5m/s, transferring -10gm/s of momentum to<br>
the centrifuge.<br>
<p>
Net change in momentum: -5 + 20 + -5 + -10 = *0*.<br>
<p>
It does not work.  It will not go.  Sorry, Mike.<br>
<p>
Trust me, I know how you feel - I, too, had a cherished Great Idea, but<br>
luckily found the flaw *before* it was published.<br>
<p>
Oh, well.<br>
