                From: Charles Platt &lt;cp@panix.com&gt;<br>
                Subject: Rat Hearts<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;paper by the father of cryobiology, Basile Luyet, describing </i><br>
<i>&gt;an experiment in which he froze pieces of rat hearts after </i><br>
<i>&gt;perfusion with 20 percent ethylene glycol. After being </i><br>
<i>&gt;rewarmed, 44 percent of the heart pieces resumed rhythmic </i><br>
<i>&gt;contractions. The paper by Luyet was titled "Resumption of </i><br>
<i>&gt;contractions after freezing in liquid nitrogen in small </i><br>
<i>&gt;pieces of rat heart containing pacemaking centers." </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Naturally, I am eager to learn in what respect the recently </i><br>
<i>&gt;reported experiment with rat hearts differs from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment performed by Luyet twenty-five years ago. Could</i><br>
<i>&gt;we get some more information on this, please?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Charles, we won't be able to give much in the way of answers to that <br>
question until the *Cryobiology* article is published.  The Vissers <br>
themselves may have something they can say which would not violate their <br>
agreement with the journal; however, we (Alcor and CI) cannot discuss the <br>
technology in any kind of detail here yet.  <br>
<p>
One major difference I CAN report is that these were entire working <br>
hearts, surgically removed from the rats, perfused so they continued to <br>
beat on their own, then frozen.  The thawed and reperfused hearts (not <br>
cut-up pieces) exhibited seemingly normal heartbeat (coordinated) in all <br>
chambers.  It looked to me like a good rat cardiac surgeon could have then <br>
transplanted the heart back into a rat.  That sounds different to me.<br>
