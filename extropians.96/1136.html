<i>&gt;development of the computer. Furthermore, computers are already being</i><br>
<i>&gt;used to assist in the further development of computing. Good changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not hard to find, and 18 month's worth of development results in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;doubling of capability. Yes, I do "imagine" that there are a long</i><br>
<i>&gt;series of "big wins". I base this on the recent 30-year trend. </i><br>
<i>&gt;... Instead, we will develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;an intelligent entity that has a computer as one component. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;entity will be smart enough to develop new hardware and software to</i><br>
<i>&gt;augment itself. This the fundamentally new factor. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;We've actually already developed the primitive precursors of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;entity.  a computor development organization that uses its own</i><br>
<i>&gt;computers to develop the next generation computer, or a software tools</i><br>
<i>&gt;shop that uses its own tools to develop its next-generation tools, is</i><br>
<i>&gt;such an entity. However, these primitive examples are not yet focused</i><br>
<i>&gt;on self-augmentation, and are not tightly-integrated enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt;precipitate a runaway fast-feedback of self-augmentation.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that the 18 month doubling rate of capacity is likely to<br>
continue.  However, I'm not convinced that this rate depends much on<br>
the "IQ" of the researchers involved.  <br>
<p>
If this doubling rate were very sensitive to the total number or<br>
researchers, lots more researchers would be hired to speed up the<br>
process.   If it depended sensitively on the IQ of these researchers, <br>
a higher premium would be placed on hiring high IQ researchers.  <br>
<p>
To the contrary, there are lots of good ideas, and the big expense is<br>
doing the grunge work of trying them out.  Raw smarts helps a little<br>
in picking the winners, but not that much.  How much grunge work gets<br>
done depends on the size of the global market for computers.  <br>
<p>
Tightly integrated self-augmentation groups *have* been tried, with<br>
poor success.  The fact is that progress depends much more on lots of<br>
little improvements across the whole economy than many people want to<br>
admit.  <br>
<p>
So uploads and artificial intelligences will improve their hardware<br>
and software, increasing the productivity of mental labor at a faster<br>
rate than has been possible so far.  But that doesn't imply a flash<br>
of super-accelerating growth - just a faster growth rate.<br>
