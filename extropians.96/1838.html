<p>
When a company becomes big enough to export labour to other lands, it has <br>
no neccessity for anything other than raw products, labour and markets. <br>
Look at United Fruit. They get cheap labour and produce from central <br>
america, and they have a rich market here. Buy low, sell high, a maxim of <br>
capitalism. Doesn't atter how many people they suppress <br>
down there, as long as we get our cheap fruit.  How many children don't <br>
get an education because they have to work in sweatshops in order to <br>
support themselves. India is a good example of capitalism running amuck. Government, although it is a <br>
coalition of many parties, including the communist one, is giving a nod <br>
to any and all international businesses. Businesses can come in, and <br>
because illegal labour is so rampant, and people are willing to work for <br>
whatever, they can produce cheap. I don't think Gap jeans loses a lot by <br>
keeping kids working.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Most of our crap jobs are given to people in  other lands  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, and that's because most people in advanced countries don't want those  </i><br>
<i>&gt; crap jobs, I see absolutely nothing immoral in giving them to those that do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The reason they want it? Because we have kept them so destitute that they <br>
will do anything to survive. I see something immoral in keeping a section <br>
of populace as cheap reserve labour for our needs. Like those Pocahontas <br>
shirts made in Haiti by women paid seven cents an hour and sold for twenty <br>
seven  dollars. Where does the money go?  I see something immoral there.  <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;Okay, call me one of those crazy idealists, but what about                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;if people worked to better each other rather than only                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;themsleves. Everybody is working for the benefit of all. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In other words, if everyone was a nice person it would be a better world. </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what else is new?  One (of many) problem with Socialism is that it assumes </i><br>
<i>&gt; that everyone is a saint, it expects people to adapt to it, The Free Market </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the other hand, adapts to people. I think the fundamental question you must </i><br>
<i>&gt; ask yourself is, what do you intend to do with the people who disagree with </i><br>
<i>&gt; you?  Millions of people, like me and the "evil" men running corporations, </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't like your ideas at all. Would you let us heretics do our own thing and </i><br>
<i>&gt; permit people to choose which camp to join, or will people like me end in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; re- education camps until we see the error in our ways and make a public  </i><br>
<i>&gt; recantation of our views.</i><br>
<p>
Nope, you can do what you want. But you can't infringe on anybody else. <br>
That means you can't take property and keep it from everybody else. <br>
Putting up electric fences and hoarding resources with superior firepower <br>
is not accepted by most people. <br>
<p>
Answering a question of who determines need:<br>
In small scale operations, it's quite easy to spot who's not carrying <br>
their fair share or is hoarding too much and to have a chat with them. If <br>
you don't like it, leave the commune. This is made easier because there is no tie to <br>
property.  <br>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;The farmer supports the builder of houses with food, while                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;the builder of houses builds for the farmer</i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm a farmer, I grow rhubarb, I give it to the house builder, he loves </i><br>
<i>&gt; rhubarb.  I already have a good house, my car however is broken. A good car </i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanic I know hates rhubarb, but he needs work done on his house, so I </i><br>
<i>&gt; tell the builder to fix the mechanic's house not mine and tell the mechanic </i><br>
<i>&gt; to fix my car. Everybody is happy and if there were just 3 of us on a desert</i><br>
<i>&gt; island that would be the end of it, but in a modern society with billions of </i><br>
<i>&gt; people in complex relationships things get very complicated very fast. We </i><br>
<i>&gt; need something to keep track of all this, fortunately we have such a device, </i><br>
<i>&gt; its called money.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Okay, sure. Money's fine as a reprensentative device. But currently it is <br>
not doing a good job. And, our system demands that everybody gets as much <br>
money as possible. Within a commune, people grow a lot of stuff, instead <br>
of haing backyards that just look pretty, they can grow food. What they <br>
can't grow they get from other communes. But the thing is, everybody does <br>
what they can. One thing I like about both <br>
sides of Anarchy is that they are totally dynamic. A system can change <br>
easily to meet needs. If one commune screws up, the people can leave and <br>
go their individual ways.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't say I agree with that. If you were chasing me with a bloody ax, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would feel very little guilt about using quite strong coercion to stop you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
And chasing you with an ax isn't a form of coercion? Well....<br>
                        <br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Noam Chomsky, definitely on my most admired  list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've read a little of his work as a social criticism, well... </i><br>
<i>&gt; he's a fine linguist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<p>
First time I read anything, I dismissed it as silly conspiracy theory, <br>
but I did check his references. The four or five I did check were true, <br>
which made me rethink a lot of things.  <br>
<p>
The fact that all his stuff is built on the information the establishment <br>
feeds is amazing. A wonderful example of biting the hand that feeds.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;I think cooperation can produce the best item for the lowest                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;price    </i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fine, you have a perfect right to think that and act on it. I presume </i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone  on this list believes in the Scientific Method, so let's put it to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the test, start your socialist commune today, I'll stick with business, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and we'll see which one turns out to be freer and more prosperous. I have no </i><br>
<i>&gt; desire to stop  you, and anyway I have a pretty good idea which one of us </i><br>
<i>&gt; will win the contest, but by all means, try to prove me wrong. If you do then </i><br>
<i>&gt; you will have beaten me fair and square in the marketplace of ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Hmm, maybe. Co-ops don't work well on a large scale, unlike cults or <br>
corporations. Where they do work, however, is in the industries that are <br>
the most exploited. Agriculture, for example, has always worked better <br>
with labour coops than corporate farming. As I said before, I am looking <br>
into starting a software co-op, but who knows what may happen.<br>
<p>
  But you, with your business, are not hampered by anything like morals. So it is perfectly acceptable for you to fire anyone who tries to <br>
campaign for better working conditions. You may be more properous, and <br>
you may be freer. But the people you employ won't be, and they are far <br>
more numerous than you.      <br>
 <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I get the impression that our positions are not symmetric, that you do have a </i><br>
<i>&gt; strong desire to stop me. If I'm wrong about that then I apologize and we </i><br>
<i>&gt; have no disagreement over morality, only over the technical points of </i><br>
<i>&gt; economics, and there is no need to worry about that, nature will let us know </i><br>
<i>&gt; which one of us is correct, no doubt about it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Maybe it's both. Boy, I'm spending way too much time defending my <br>
views...Oh well, that's what the Net is for  I guess. <br>
