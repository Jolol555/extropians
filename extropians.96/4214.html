In the good ole days before I damaged my body so badly that I couldn't do it<br>
any more, I used to run for perhaps a half hour a day, round and round a<br>
sportsfield so I didn't need to watch what I was doing, and go into a daze.<br>
If I was writing a novel or having trouble with a theoretical issue, I'd<br>
begin by `muttering' something about it to myself, but this would swiftly<br>
turn into decerebrated babble.  At the end I'd cool off, jog home, take a<br>
hot shower, and halfway through the shower know the answer (or *an* answer)<br>
to the problem.  I can still do it, but not as effectively as when my<br>
awareness went out of the loop due to sheer punishing physical effort; these<br>
days it sometimes takes terminal dithering and anxiety before the lid pops.<br>
But it's still a lovely feeling when it does...<br>
