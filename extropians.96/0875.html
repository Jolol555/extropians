Joint Announcement of Cryonics Institute and<br>
Alcor Life Extension Foundation<br>
<p>
RAT HEARTS REVIVED FROM LIQUID<br>
NITROGEN--this milestone in cryobiology has<br>
been confirmed at the Alcor facility during<br>
the week of Aug. 30-Sep. 4, 1996.<br>
<p>
The achievement was reported last year from<br>
the University of Pretoria, South Africa, by<br>
Michelle Olga Visser, who used a new<br>
cryoprotective agent (CPA). She also<br>
reported submitting a paper on the<br>
experiment to CRYOBIOLOGY, with three<br>
co-authors at her university, in December<br>
1995.<br>
<p>
Mrs. Visser is Head of Research, Department<br>
of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine,<br>
University of Pretoria. She is a<br>
perfusionist by training and practice,<br>
working for the University hospital and also<br>
as an independent contractor. She is a Ph.D.<br>
candidate in cryobiology, whose studies<br>
include physiology and pharmacology. <br>
<p>
She has been doing research in organ<br>
cryopreservation for the last three years,<br>
after having started the first homograft<br>
bank in Pretoria eight years ago at her<br>
department. She set up this bank to store<br>
heart valves harvested for re-implantation,<br>
using standard cryo procedures (DMSO), and<br>
developed an interest in developing a method<br>
for organs.<br>
<p>
Her original report was met with general<br>
skepticism or indifference, and publication<br>
has apparently been delayed by requests for<br>
revisions. But Anatole Dolinoff, president<br>
of the Cryonics Society of France, suggested<br>
that Mrs. Visser get in touch with Robert<br>
Ettinger, and extensive discussions by<br>
e-mail followed. CI and Alcor invited her<br>
and her husband Siegfried to come to Arizona<br>
as our guests and demonstrate the Visser<br>
method with rat hearts. This was finally<br>
done, and we have seen first-hand the<br>
confirmation of this<br>
accomplishment--arguably the most important<br>
since 1948, when Jean Rostand froze frog<br>
sperm with glycerol.<br>
<p>
The Vissers were assisted in the Alcor<br>
building, in a lab used and lent by<br>
CryoSearch Inc., by biochemist Hugh Hixon<br>
and by other Alcor people including Rhonda<br>
Iacuzzo and Tanya Jones. Witnesses included<br>
Steve Bridge, Mike Perry, Robert and Mae<br>
Ettinger, Fred and Linda Chamberlain, David<br>
Pizer, Paul Garfield, Ralph Whelan, Brian<br>
Shock, Derek Ryan, and Mathew Sullivan. Fred<br>
and Linda also helped with some of the<br>
chores, including videotaping.<br>
<p>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS: It wasn't<br>
smooth going. The equipment was different<br>
than the Vissers were accustomed to, and<br>
some of it was not compatible; and human<br>
error is easy with small animal organs.<br>
There were several failures during several<br>
long days of work. But there were also two<br>
hearts that showed weak beating and one that<br>
showed strong beating, after rewarming from<br>
liquid nitrogen temperature. This is<br>
unequivocal proof that the Visser technique<br>
(at least as applied to rat hearts) is far<br>
superior to anything previously reported. <br>
<p>
Control hearts--immersed in liquid nitrogen<br>
in the same manner but not perfused--showed<br>
gross damage, including cracking, and no<br>
signs of life.<br>
<p>
Because of limitations of equipment, the<br>
hearts were kept in liquid nitrogen for only<br>
a half minute to a minute--but the<br>
temperature probe showed core temperature<br>
within a few degrees of that of liquid<br>
nitrogen, - 196 C or - 320 F. Once such a<br>
temperature is reached, it is generally<br>
agreed that the length of time of storage<br>
does not matter. Mrs. Visser reports that<br>
the longest she has kept hearts in liquid<br>
nitrogen is 45 minutes, and these were<br>
successfully revived. Alcor personnel will<br>
be working to establish a reliable, routine<br>
experimental protocol, and will be storing<br>
rat hearts for longer periods. Cryonics<br>
Institute also plans to test longer term<br>
storage of various organs. <br>
<p>
BRAINS: For cryonics, results with brains<br>
are the most important. There are<br>
experimental and theoretical reasons to<br>
think the Visser method will work well with<br>
brains also. The CPA penetrates the<br>
blood-brain barrier. Preliminary experiments<br>
at Alcor with rat brains show normal<br>
appearance to the naked eye and under the<br>
light microscope (but we do not yet have<br>
micrographs). <br>
<p>
LIMITATIONS OF THIS REPORT: Pending journal<br>
publication of their paper, the authors do<br>
not want to publicize the identity of the<br>
CPA or other details of the procedure, or to<br>
discuss the mechanism of cryoprotection.<br>
Patents have been applied for, or soon will<br>
be, in South Africa and several other<br>
countries, by Cryopreservation Technologies<br>
cc, the South African corporation in which<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Visser are majority<br>
shareholders. <br>
<p>
CRYONICS LICENSING AGREEMENT: In return for<br>
help in funding their further research, the<br>
Vissers have given CI and Alcor exclusive<br>
license to use their present and future<br>
technology for cryonics purposes. This<br>
includes the right to sub-license. <br>
<p>
PERSONAL NOTES: The Vissers formed an<br>
excellent working relationship with Hugh<br>
Hixon--who impressed everyone with his<br>
resourcefulness in adapting equipment--as<br>
well as with other Alcor people including<br>
Rhonda Iacuzzo and Tanya Jones. The Vissers<br>
stayed with Mae and Bob Ettinger, and were<br>
pleasant, considerate, and extremely<br>
interesting guests. There were many long<br>
conversations on a variety of topics-<br>
especially between the Vissers and Mae,<br>
since Bob was often tied up with other<br>
duties. Mr. Visser, a consulting engineer,<br>
understands the Visser method thoroughly and<br>
acts as lab partner; he is also the main<br>
business person in the Vissers' company.<br>
Mrs. Visser, despite her amazing energy,<br>
drive, and perfectionism, is also kind and<br>
understanding.<br>
<p>
<p>
NON-CRYONICS RESEARCH: A priority of the<br>
Visser group is to pursue research with<br>
large animal organs, in preparation for<br>
transplant experiments, leading up to human<br>
cryogenic organ banking. There are reasons<br>
to believe there is a very large potential<br>
market for such technology--not only<br>
including such traditional transplant<br>
candidates as kidney, heart, liver,<br>
pancreas, corneas etc., but also limbs or<br>
digits, glands such as thyroid, and others.<br>
<p>
TIME HORIZONS: When Mrs. Visser has funding,<br>
she estimates 8 months to a year to prove<br>
pig organ transplants. After that, the time<br>
required to get permission for human<br>
clinical trials, and to run those trials,<br>
and then to get regulatory approval, depends<br>
on the country or countries of choice and<br>
other factors. All told, perhaps 3 to 5<br>
years. The demand for transplants, and the<br>
life-saving nature of the technology, might<br>
expedite matters, compared to customary<br>
procedures.<br>
<p>
For 100% proof of reversible<br>
cryopreservation of the human brain, we know<br>
of no reliable way to make even a rough<br>
guess. It will take as long as it takes. But<br>
with the Visser method we have a running<br>
start--and it seems very possible that our<br>
cryonics patients will very soon have much<br>
better suspensions than any previously<br>
available. <br>
