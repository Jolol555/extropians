<i>&gt;        I notice that within the past month, the signal:noise ratio seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be getting quite lopsided in the (IMO) undesirable direction.</i><br>
<p>
I've been on the list for over two years, and must unfortunately agree. Since <br>
the list became more open, with the subscription fee removed, I find myself <br>
increasingly deleting messages without reading them. The other day I had 50+ <br>
messages, of which I read maybe two. The bulk of communication on the list has <br>
become predictable.<br>
<p>
I must unfortunately unsubscribe. (Like anyone will miss a turbo-lurker like <br>
myself) I fully intend to check out the ExI web site and archives on a regular <br>
basis, and to subscribe to Extropy. I hope these will prove as stimulating as <br>
this list was in its heyday.<br>
