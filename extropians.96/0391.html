Yes.  For two and a half billion years all you had on earth was simple <br>
prokaryotic cell, for 700 million years after that you got much more complex <br>
eukaryotic cells, but still no multicellular organisms. After that, <br>
570 million years ago, the Cambrian  explosion happened and things started <br>
to get interesting.<br>
   <br>
There were multi cellular life forms called " The Ediacaran Fauna" before <br>
the Cambrian Explosion, but it only predated it by an instant, just <br>
100 million yeaes.  All the Ediacaran fauna looked pretty much the same, <br>
flat and soft bodied. The Tommotian Fauna was even closer to the Cambrian <br>
Explosion, just 40 million years before, they were the first animals with  <br>
hard parts, but they also all looked much the same , blade or cup like in  <br>
this case. Neither fauna had the huge diversity that the animals in the <br>
Cambrian Explosion had. Many, including Stephen Jay Gould think both these <br>
faunas were failed independent experiments in  multicellular life that have <br>
no living descendants, just footnotes in the history of life, others think <br>
they had descendants and were key to the explosion.<br>
