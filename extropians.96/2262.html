Today, more and more computer programmers refer to themselves as engineers.<br>
Today, more and more computer graphic architects refer to themselves as<br>
engineers.  In the past, an engineer was thought of as someone who designs,<br>
for example, a Golden Gate Bridge.<br>
<p>
The lines are becoming blurred.<br>

I suppose to respond to your query, I would have to go backwards a bit in my<br>
thinking and separate engineering from art with firm and unmovable<br>
boundaries as both professions have been thought of historically.  But I<br>
cannot.  I would prefer not to use old-world references when discussing<br>
current-day concepts.<br>
<p>
I agree with you that we need to utilize aspects of our thinking in Extropic<br>
ways to move forward.<br>
