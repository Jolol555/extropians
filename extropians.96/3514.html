<i>&gt;From: Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Date: Sat, 30 Nov 1996 18:16:13 -0600</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I may make a suggestion?  Start a new thread called "Extropian Form</i><br>
<i>&gt;Letter", devoted to building an outline for an article/letter/pamphlet</i><br>
<i>&gt;that would introduce the untutored to the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My feeble take on V.1,</i><br>
<i>&gt;from an article I was working on:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Title:  "History Ends In 2025, If We're Smart Enough."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Reasons:  Introduce "End of History" to grab attention</i><br>
<p>
I've never understood the "End of History" meme.  (I know Francis Fukuyama<br>
wrote a book titled *The End of History and the Last Man.*)  I think it's<br>
inaccurate, even tho' some will defend it as an metaphor.  History will<br>
never end until existence ends.  Human history will never end until human<br>
existence ends.<br>
<p>
I think revolutionary events, e.g., the singularity, cause significant<br>
"historical shifts" but not the end of history.<br>
<p>
(Actually, I don't like the term "singularity," either, but I'll save that<br>
criticism for another post.  I like the concept, just not the name for it.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.</i><br>
<p>
Also, isn't it Moore's Law that states that the processing power of the<br>
microchip doubles at least every 18 months?  Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought<br>
that wouldn't necessarily equate to computers doubling in power every two<br>
subjective years.<br>
<p>
