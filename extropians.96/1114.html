Robin,<br>
<p>
I think you're drawing a tighter line around what counts as an<br>
experiment than you intended.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ira Brodsky wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"Since the fixed stars in the parts of the sky near the sun become</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;visible during a total eclipse, it is possible to check this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;theoretical conclusion [a ray of light coming from a fixed star and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;just grazing the border of the sun will be deflected by 0.83</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;seconds of an arc] by experiment."</i><br>
<p>
Robin responded:<br>
<i>&gt; This isn't an "experiment" in the sense that you've been using -</i><br>
<i>&gt; control over variables.  They only looked.  They didn't go move the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sun around or anything.  The closest you get is using signals from</i><br>
<i>&gt; spacecraft, where you control where the spacecraft goes.  That is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; small fraction of astronomy (though a large fraction of planetary</i><br>
<i>&gt; astronomy).</i><br>
<p>
They can move telescopes around, make predictions for other celestial<br>
objects and verify them, do the observations from spacecraft or<br>
aircraft as well as ground-based observatories, etc.  This seems to be<br>
fully as controllable an experiment as you need to become convinced of<br>
the predictive value of Einstein's conjecture.<br>
