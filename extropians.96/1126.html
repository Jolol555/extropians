<i> &gt;&gt;IAN: Of course the missile theory sounds like "anti-gravity" </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;experiments, because, like anti-gravity, everybody knows that </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;missiles could never fly across the sky, much less hit a plane </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;-- why it's patently absurd.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Obviously, they were not comparing the relative likelihood of </i><br>
<i> &gt;missiles being able to fly vs. anti-gravity devices working.  They </i><br>
<i> &gt;were comparing the relative likelihood of our government going </i><br>
<i> &gt;to all this trouble to cover up *this* specific accident (when </i><br>
<i> &gt;we all know there have been accidents before, some pretty major, </i><br>
<i> &gt;which were *not* covered up) vs. the likelihood that the </i><br>
<i> &gt;government is funding ridiculously goofy research.  </i><br>
<p>
IAN: We also know that those guilty of crimes or errors always <br>
rush forward to admit their wrongdoing, so indeed, suggesting <br>
otherwise is like anti-gravity machine crankery.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Your criticism of an analogy which was not the intended </i><br>
<i> &gt; one does little to support your case.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I never assumed that what I said had any bearing on <br>
the witness of over 100 people and radar in New York. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Can you imagine that, 100 crazy conspiratorial people attacking </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;the truth-meme, which is that missiles can't fly or hit planes.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The 'truth meme' that was referred to is not that 'missiles can't fly'.</i><br>
<i> &gt;It wasn't even that 'the government didn't do it'.  The truth meme </i><br>
<i> &gt;that (Ira Brodsky?) referred to was the 'truth' that they *did* do it.  </i><br>
<i> &gt;(Ira's?) point was that if the government *is* covering this up, that </i><br>
<i> &gt;means that the truth meme of their *involvement* is weak, since they </i><br>
<i> &gt;appear to be getting away with the 'coverup'.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I believe your correct that by truth-meme Ira did not imply <br>
"truth-meme = no missile." However, coming off the "Navy<br>
missile theory = anti-gravity claims" it was not obvious to me,<br>
it is unexpected to imply a claim is crack-potism and then turn<br>
around and consider that maybe it is real. But, that seems to be<br>
what Ira did, so I own Ira an apology: Ira, sorry dude.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; As to whether we can imagine 100 people being mistaken in unison,</i><br>
<i> &gt; the answer is yes.  It happens all the time.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: We might as well throw all eyewitness testimony out the window.<br>
Any eyewitness report is just as likely a hallucination as any other.<br>
Even if over 100 people see the same thing at the same time, it's no <br>
more a measure of truth than if one person sees it. Pretty radical <br>
standard.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Your attack on something other than what </i><br>
<i> &gt; was actually said does not support your case.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: The only measure of support for my case I ever suggested was<br>
the report of 100+ witnesses and radar. I never suggested that <br>
my words were making this testimony more valid. But of course<br>
since eyewitness is totally unreliable, it seems there is zero<br>
evidence of any missile. The missile theory is swept away.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; And is it really necessary to point out that 'reports of something </i><br>
<i> &gt; that could indicate something' are *not* incontravertable evidence?</i><br>
<p>
IAN: But it is evidence, which seems much more than you'll allow.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; By the way, are you now denying that radar ever yields spurious </i><br>
<i> &gt; signals?  Is radar infallible?</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Radar is fallible and everybody was hallucinating. No missile.<br>
They should junk all radars, no radar reports are reliable, especially<br>
those supported by mass group hallucinations.<br>
<p>
