<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Obviously, you misunderstood. I was referring to good science, while </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; medicine does not qualify as science at all. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Am I missing sarcasm here, or do you really think there is some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;connection between that slander and reality?  I think the /millions/</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of lives saved by good, rational, science in medicine over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;last few decades, despite the public's continued fascination with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mystical bullshit like astrology, homeopathy, and "alternative"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;medicines are more than sufficient evidence.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While I agree with you in general, the medical establishment in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt; is clealy more obviously interested in self-protection than science.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Its outright rejection, without cause, of chiropractic, deep-tissue</i><br>
<i>&gt; massage, accupuncture and chinese herbal medicine is evidence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this.  I name these "alternative medicines" because I have greatly</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefitted from them personally.  I am very fortunate to have an MD</i><br>
<i>&gt; who is also an accupuncturist and who does not scoff at every medical</i><br>
<i>&gt; technique that does not use surgery or patented drugs.</i><br>
<p>
If you could show me some responsible valid double-blind studies<br>
that show the effectiveness of chiropractic, massage, accupuncture,<br>
or herbal medicine (apart from those herbs used to manufacture known<br>
drugs like ephedrine), then there would not be a single doctor in<br>
the "establishment" that would "suppress" them.  Quite the contrary,<br>
they would be joyously recommending the new methods, ust as there<br>
are many doctors extolling the virtues of medical marijuana today<br>
despite serious government threats against them.  "Alternative<br>
medicine" is just a euphemism for unproven medicine.  Responsible<br>
doctors have no choice but to disapprove.  If they recommended such<br>
therapies without proof, they would be risking their patients' lives<br>
on nothing more substantial than anecdotes and mystical nonsense.<br>
They would be culpaple murderers.  Homeopaths, herbalists, and<br>
chiropractors who treat, say, cancer patients and advise them against<br>
proven therapies like chemotherapy and radiation are responsible for<br>
thousands of deaths no less than if they had pulled a trigger.  If<br>
a person wishes to use experimental therapies himself for his own<br>
reasons and under his own advice and responsibility, I would not<br>
stand in his way--I have no love of the FDA--but for a professional<br>
to actually recommend them on faith is at best willful fraud.<br>
<p>
The old canards about supression of alternatives to bolster the<br>
finances of the establishment is hollow rhetoric spouted by these<br>
charlatans because they can't talk about proof.  Open your eyes:<br>
the plain facts are that 20 years ago, leukemia and breast cancer<br>
were death sentences.  Now, most survive.  This didn't happen<br>
because of herbalists; it happened because of radiation and chemo,<br>
and because doctors held themselves to the standards of /science/,<br>
not the new-age hippy feelgood bullshit of the popular press.<br>
<p>
If I sound harsh, it is with reason.  I cannot stand idly by and<br>
allow the genocide of gullible sick people by snake-oil salesmen<br>
without expressing my moral revulsion.  I love life, and my moral<br>
standards spring from that love of life, and I revile those who<br>
would destroy it.<br>
