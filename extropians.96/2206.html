I was going to write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   No!  You're *all* AIs, and I'm the only live human here!</i><br>
<p>
And then suddenly I realized the truth.  We're all AIs ...  :-)<br>
<p>
'Come to think of it, that's not entirely a joke.  As far as we know,<br>
nature doesn't actually create intelligence, but only an infrastructure<br>
that can develop intelligence through interacting with its environment.<br>
<p>
In that sense, Mankind develops its own intelligence, so it's artificial<br>
despite being implemented on a biological substrate.  There's more to<br>
this than just a play on words, because if that view is true then we are<br>
only a few short steps away from creating an artificial substrate which<br>
can develop intelligence in the same way as we.  The neural technology<br>
is more or less here already, especially now that multi-valued systems<br>
are no longer frowned upon except by a few academics, so all we need is<br>
micro-scale replication (nano not needed in principle, but possibly yes<br>
in practice) for such substrates to become practicable.<br>
<p>
Question:  has the AI community run a learning neural automaton long<br>
enough to simulate even a fraction of the learning process of a typical<br>
child by the age of (say) three?  I think I know the answer ("No", by<br>
several orders of magnitude because of the computational requirements),<br>
but confirmation or denial from within that community would be useful.<br>
Of course, even that computational epic would probably fall short of<br>
producing a child mentality, but it would provide useful information<br>
towards that goal.<br>
<p>
