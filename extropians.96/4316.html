A few years ago I took some Sanskrit classes.  What I will describe here <br>
is a weekend class.  The teacher's name is Vyaas Houston.  He is <br>
an American in his forties.  He looks and talks just like Dick Cavett.  <br>
<p>
His classes start Friday evening.  There are usually about 15 or 20 <br>
students, drawn from all walks of life.  There are usually some sweet <br>
old ladies and retired gentlemen who are interested in yoga.  They <br>
haven't been in a classroom in decades and may be a little nervous <br>
about it.  There are some young, hippie-type yoga students, and they are <br>
also a little antsy about being in a classroom.   And there are some <br>
doctors, programmers, scientists, and so forth.  Some people in this <br>
latter group are very competitive.  They have been straight-A students <br>
all their lives, and their egos depend on being able to learn anything <br>
better than anybody.  What happens next is going to be even worse <br>
for them than for the others. <br>
<p>
Vyaas starts by asking everyone to listen to him chant a line of Sanskrit, <br>
and repeat it.  "Ah au aha."  Well, that's easy enough.  We all go <br>
Ah au aha.  Each one repeats this, all the way around the group.  <br>
Then he adds another line.  (These are case endings, by the way, <br>
but we don't know that yet.)  "Ah au aha,  am au an."  At this point, <br>
since these are nonsense syllables that we have never heard before, <br>
it starts to get a little confusing.  He tells us, "You don't have to get it <br>
right.  If you don't remember the exact sound, just make something up.  <br>
It's okay if you don't get it right."  Of course, no one believes this.  <br>
We have to get it right.  Ah au aha;  am au an.  So far, so good.  <br>
Anybody can remember six syllables long enough to repeat them.  <br>
<p>
He adds a third line. "Ah au aha;  am au an;  ena abhyam aih."  <br>
We are supposed to repeat this.  It's harder than it may appear.  <br>
Three lines is a big jump beyond two.  The syllables sound alike <br>
and run together.  Our short-term memory registers only have <br>
so much capacity.  <br>
<p>
Vyaas reminds us that we don't have to get it right.  Most of us, with <br>
great effort, do get it right, at least to a close approximation.  Ah au aha;  <br>
am au an;  ena abhyam aih.  Some people resort to making something up <br>
when their turn comes.  We get through this part, somehow, but we are <br>
beginning to feel fear, a fear that threatens our egos, a fear of failure, <br>
humiliation, public exposure...  We feel many things;  very primitive <br>
things.  Our minds are in turmoil.  If somebody is going to fail, let it be <br>
the other guy.  Don't let it be me.  <br>
<p>
Then he adds a fourth line.  "Ah au aha;  am au an;  ena abhyam aih;  <br>
aya abhyam ebhyaha."  We are supposed to repeat all this.  It is almost <br>
impossible.  Four lines is an enormous step beyond three.  It's like <br>
going to a juggling class, and being expected to juggle four balls the <br>
very first time.  We try, but it's hopeless.   Ah au aha;  am au an;  ena <br>
abhyam aih...  and what's the rest?  As the other members of the class <br>
recite, you remember the last line -- but then you forget the first line.  <br>
Your turn to recite is coming up... FEAR... PANIC... you can't hold <br>
all that stuff in your mind at once... you are going to fail... everyone is <br>
going to laugh at you... you may lose your job and all your friends and <br>
end up a street person.  Miraculously, most of us do manage to repeat <br>
most of the syllables.  But our hearts are pounding.  <br>
<p>
Of course, when someone does fail, no one laughs.  No one cares.  <br>
It's not the end of the world.  Our fear of failure was an illusion, but <br>
nevertheless a real fear at the time.  It's amazing how much fear can be <br>
generated by this simple exercise.  Hardly anyone can go through this <br>
without being shaken.  Even when I took the class for the third time, <br>
I was still afraid of failing.  (Not as much as the first time.)  <br>
<p>
When we finish, Vyaas asks us what has been going through our minds.  <br>
We spend the rest of the evening talking about the fact that we did not <br>
listen to the sounds, experience them, and repeat them; instead, we were <br>
thinking about ourselves, our inadequacies, the competitive situation, <br>
how we appeared to the other students...  We thought about everything <br>
except the sounds we were supposed to be listening to.  We defeated <br>
ourselves.  More precisely, he set us up so we would inevitably defeat <br>
ourselves;  he is driving at something.  <br>
<p>
He asks us to enter into an agreement.  For the rest of the class, <br>
we agree to "follow the point."  In other words, when he is saying <br>
something, we just listen.  When he is pointing to something on an <br>
alphabet chart, we just look.  If we find ourselves drifting off, we <br>
come back to the point.  When we are called on to recite, we just <br>
think about the problem at hand.  When someone else recites, we <br>
give them our full attention and support.  <br>
<p>
We also agree to interrupt and ask questions any time we are lost;  <br>
we give ourselves permission to do that, and we also give everyone else <br>
permission to do the same.  No doubt you have had the experience of <br>
being in a classroom and being so lost that you didn't even know <br>
what to ask.  You are afraid that if you ask a dumb question, you will <br>
embarrass yourself.  Of course the guy sitting next to you is just as lost, <br>
but he is afraid to ask a question because he thinks you will think he is <br>
an idiot.  Everybody sits there wishing someone would stop the <br>
teacher and ask a question, but no one does, so the teacher keeps <br>
talking and leaves everyone farther and farther behind.  Vyaas wants to <br>
avoid this situation at all costs, so we agree in advance to stop him <br>
any time we are not able to follow the point.  <br>
<p>
He is teaching us the elements of yoga  (not hatha yoga).  <br>
<p>
There is no more Sanskrit Friday night.  We spend the entire evening <br>
talking about how we defeated ourselves, and what we can do about it.  <br>
The agreements are the key to the whole thing.  Everybody has to <br>
understand what we are agreeing to do, and why.  We have to get the <br>
agreements nailed down before proceeding.    <br>
<p>
When the Sanskrit class proper begins Saturday morning, we are in a <br>
different space.  Everyone follows the point.  Everyone asks questions.  <br>
This is like no classroom I have ever been in before.   We learn at an <br>
incredible speed.  By Saturday night, we have all learned the alphabet, <br>
and we are able to read sutras in Sanskrit, in the devanagari script.  <br>
I mean everybody -- not just the A students, but the old ladies too.  <br>
Waiting for the slow students doesn't hold the fast students back -- <br>
it helps us to go even faster.  <br>
<p>
After a few hours of this, there are no class divisions, <br>
no smart students and dumb students.  We are all there together,<br>
in a way that we have seldom been together with anybody <br>
in our entire lives.  <br>
<p>
Sunday night, when the class is over, we go back to our separate lives;  <br>
back to The World.  But we carry with us the knowledge that <br>
life doesn't have to be the way it usually is.  Something better is <br>
possible.  <br>
