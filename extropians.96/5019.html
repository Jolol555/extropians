<i>&gt;If you could show me some responsible valid double-blind studies</i><br>
<i>&gt;that show the effectiveness of chiropractic, massage, accupuncture,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or herbal medicine (apart from those herbs used to manufacture known</i><br>
<i>&gt;drugs like ephedrine), then there would not be a single doctor in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "establishment" that would "suppress" them.</i><br>
<p>
I beg to differ.  The AMA has a stranglehold on the practice of medicine<br>
like the ABA has a stranglehold on the practice of law.  They're both<br>
professional guilds, descended from the guilds of medieval times, and<br>
they're just cutting down on competition.  Besides, even though I receive<br>
medical<br>
newsletters from Mayo Clinic, CSPI, Harvard, and UC Berkeley, as well<br>
as synopses of studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine<br>
and other such publications, stating that the treatments you mention can<br>
be effective for particular ailments, there _are_ people who sell snake<br>
oil -- the trick is to know who those people are.  Hint -- if it has a<br>
full-page ad with testimonials in the National Enquirer, look askance.<br>
<p>
Another point:  how are you supposed to do a double-blind study on<br>
chiropractic or massage?  When my chiropractor puts a bone back in<br>
place, I _know_ it.  And if my neck hurts and the bone _doesn't_ go<br>
back in, I know that, too.  She knows as well, but in case something<br>
else is also wrong, she doesn't tell me I feel better, she asks.  Same<br>
for massage -- If a muscle starts out feeling like hard rubber and ends<br>
up feeling like firm Jello, there's no hiding that from either the<br>
practicioner or the client.  And I know when I go to incompetent<br>
masseurs because the muscles feel little better when they're done.<br>
With acupuncture (one 'c', please), the study can be single-blind, but<br>
not double.  The practicioner knows whether the needles were placed<br>
in the prescribed spots or not, even if the client doesn't.  I'll<br>
grant you that placebos could be given in place of herbal medicines,<br>
so the studies could be double-blind.  Echinacea, for example, has<br>
passed that test.<br>
<p>
Enough.  Like the AMA, you can keep raising the bar for statistical<br>
significance and study acceptability.  I'll withdraw and continue<br>
doing and recommending what works for me.  I haven't tried acupuncture<br>
yet despite numerous recommendations; I hate needles.  I also recognize<br>
that that hatred is likely to skew my perceived results.  Remember<br>
cognitive dissonance?  The more I hate the ordeal, the more likely I<br>
am to say it was effective.<br>
<p>
