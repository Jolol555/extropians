Well, the Braintennis at Wired has been interesting.  There may be<br>
disadvantages to having Extropianism as the posterchild of<br>
transhumanism: we attract all the newage.  How this list manages to so<br>
much purer than alt.extropians or such Web discussions I don't know.<br>
<p>
But Mark Stahlman's vituperation did help me crystallize my perception<br>
of all this more, as reflected in my post, and I've been cohering some<br>
more old thoughts, which I shall now share with you, hoping that I am<br>
not mutating the original label too far myself.<br>
<p>
"Extropianism need not be wedded to specific technologies, such as<br>
nanotech or cryonics, or even to such speculations as the Singularity.<br>
Extropianism is an attitude, like the Enlightenment.  In fact, in my<br>
view Extropianism _is_ the Enlightenment, upgraded to incorporate new<br>
key concepts.  Adam Smith's markets and Darwin's evolution [spontaneous<br>
order] in addition to Newton's physics; computers and cellular automata<br>
in addition to clocks; self-modification in addition to<br>
self-understanding, now that the former is more conceivable; and atheism<br>
and anarchy instead of Deism and benevolent despotism.  And belief in<br>
universal education by the state, once a key progressive element of the<br>
Enlightenment, has been abandoned in disillusionment.  Otherwise the<br>
core is the same: acceptance of criticism, respect for individual choice<br>
and diversity, and the materialist and liberal/libertarian worldview and<br>
politics which scientific criticism and personal freedom have spawned."<br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure this isn't incompatible with Extropianism.  Am I<br>
diluting the latter too much, though, such that the above should be<br>
called 'neo-Enlightenment' or something, or am I on target?<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
