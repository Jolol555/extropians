<i>&gt;After all, is the State itself not a "spontaneous organization? --</i><br>
<i>&gt;a self-organized structure.  The State was not exactly set in place</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the outside, now was it -- it EMERGED, just like thought patterns</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a neural network, just like hexagonal rolls in a Benard cell,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. etc.</i><br>
<p>
The claim of spontaneous order is that if things repeatedly reorganize<br>
and compete among themselves, the resulting order is likely to be<br>
"good" in some sense.  States are too long lived; their current<br>
configuration is determined by their initial configuration and<br>
internal politics more than by competition among different states.<br>
For instance, most US citizens haven't considered moving to other<br>
countries, so the US isn't being forced to compete with other<br>
countries to provide a desirable living environment.  (Maybe the US is<br>
providing the best living environment, or maybe it isn't; that's not<br>
my point.  My point here is that most people born and raised in the US<br>
haven't seriously compared it to other alternatives.)<br>
<p>
States are like DOS - a stable standard that is there for historical<br>
reasons, not because anybody would choose it now.  After enough time<br>
passes, they'll become less relevant, just as the latest version of<br>
Windows NT can't run all DOS programs and I don't care if Linux can<br>
run all DOS programs.  With advancing communications technology, the<br>
evolution of these organizations speeds up, so the state ages faster.<br>
