<p>
What if I see the behaviour I do not *agree* with?<br>
For example, the populace that votes for somebody who promised them no<br>
taxes and lots of free booze.  This may look like a good idea to every<br>
particular person, but politically it may be disastrous.<br>
Nobody says that representatives of the masses can't make babies or<br>
fix cars - in these everyday actions people's skills may be roughly<br>
equal or at least independent of their societal talents.  There are<br>
different areas of competence, and people who excel in one may not<br>
excel in another (though most of them probably correlate). The word<br>
"masses" is usually used in relation to making large-scale social<br>
decisions. Somehow, the U.S. society that recognizes plumbers as uniquely<br>
skilled professionals that are solely qualified to fix your toilet,<br>
at the same time requires no qualification for taking part in the<br>
political decision-making process.  No wonder political structures<br>
in this country stink more than toilets.  This is quite useful for<br>
the power structures who under the guise of "empowering" everybody<br>
by including them into making decisions in the areas they may not<br>
understand, assure themselves a much easier manipulable political<br>
substrate.  If people were trusted only with the jobs they can do,<br>
whether it's plumbing or voting, and would delegate other jobs to<br>
somebody who *they* think could do it better - and be *personally<br>
accountable* for the decisions (the [political] toilet you helped<br>
design exploded - *you* cleanup and compensate those who suffered<br>
because of you), things could look very much different.<br>
<p>
  Most normal people seem quite good at understanding what they are<br>
competent in, when they have appropriate incentives and are accountable.<br>
The voting process oversimplifies the issues to create an illusion<br>
that everybody can understand international politics and economic and<br>
military strategies - and then tells people that those who vote for the<br>
wrong side pay no more for the consequences than those who begged them<br>
not to do it.  <br>
<p>
If you deliberately remove all incentives for competent and accountable<br>
decision-making, the results may be expected to look stupid.<br>
Put these incentives in - and the same "masses" would produce <br>
results much more suitable for any purpose.  Except supporting<br>
a monolithic bureaucracy.<br>
