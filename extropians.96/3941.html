Except that the issue isn't just one of government.  Brin's scenario is<br>
of everyone watching everyone.  whysean said this would increase<br>
tolerance and acceptance.  But I have memories of people escaping from<br>
small towns to the big city and praising the anonymity and privacy from<br>
being lost in the crowd, although some also regret the impersonality.<br>
The point is that small towns are often represented as near zero-privacy<br>
milieus, and therefore represented as hell for deviants.  I can't argue<br>
that a huge open society would have to be the same as a small one, but I<br>
haven't seen any counterarguments either.<br>
<p>
Of course, strictly speaking Brin's thesis seems to be that we won't be<br>
able to avoid being watched at all, so it is simply a question of<br>
whether we'd be better off being watched by one person or group or by<br>
everybody.  Given the starting point I grant the preferability of the<br>
latter.  But I think the given is unproven.  Privacy was never the<br>
natural state; naked people on the plain have to wear clothes and build<br>
walls.  Technology can make privacy harder, but it can also counter<br>
itself.  Little bugs staring at my keyboard can be squished.  Very<br>
little bugs can be hunted down by other bugs.  One's home can be made<br>
private, I think.  Public areas would be open to cameras, yes.  That's<br>
what public means.<br>
<p>
And if Brin has actually called for banning the use of cryptography <br>
something is definitely wrong.  I'm not sure that he has done such a<br>
thing, though.<br>
