<p>
This is incorrect. Neither the "burning" of glucose or anything else takes<br>
place at the same rate during hypothermia. Eg. the heart rate does<br>
naturally slow down and eventually stops altogether at about 16'C. The<br>
major problem with hypothermia is that various biological reaction rates<br>
decrease with temperature by very different rates. The relationship of<br>
these rates is optimal for human life at or just below (sometimes just<br>
above) normal body temperature, 37'C. The only other boundary point of<br>
temperature at which the human body is viable over a long timespan is below<br>
the "glass transition" temperature of the cryoprotectant cocktail/tissue<br>
mixture. A "safe" value for this temperature is -140'C.<br>

<p>
I agree this sounds great, but unfortunately reality doesn't always help<br>
with our bright ideas of what the world could and should be like. No such<br>
mechanism of suppression exists and the work of trying to find one (with<br>
all the different biochemical processes taking place in the body) would be<br>
an enormously greater problem (most likely not solvable) than finding a<br>
whole-body reversible vitrification protocol. This last job is basically<br>
just technological hunting. If it can be done (and the design space of<br>
cryoprotectants -- even of untried combinations -- is very large), not a<br>
lot of "fundamental" research should be required. That is the reason why<br>
the project is as "inexpensive" as it is (compared with more fundmental<br>
open-ended research) and why a time-to-completion can be estimated.<br>

<p>
This has been looked into. In my opinion it would require a genetic<br>
supplementation of human DNA with the appropriate animal DNA to produce the<br>
neccessary anti-ice crystal proteins and anti-freeze chemicals when<br>
prompted by some triggering agent. In any case, doubling or tripling a 6<br>
months life expectancy period for a terminal patient, simply isn't going to<br>
cut it.<br>

I will ask my friend Steve Harris, MD about this, but I'm pretty certain<br>
this must be an exaggeration. Yes, extreme hypothyroidism can slow down<br>
many bodily processes, but it can kill you too, because it, again, does so<br>
unevenly with respect to different body systems. And you still have to eat<br>
and eliminate waste, and the institutional care costs would be<br>
astronomical. One of the benefits of suspended animation will be that it<br>
will allow more people who can't afford enormously costly operations (often<br>
of only of short-term benefit) to be, less expensively, sent into the<br>
future where their problems can be cheaply and easily fixed.<br>
