<i>&gt; You may or may not have heard about Carl Sagan's death this morning. I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; known about his illness for some time, because my oldest friend works(ed)</i><br>
<i>&gt; for him at Cornell. I'm very sorry, I didn't get a chance to talk to</i><br>
<i>&gt; her and Sagan's family about cryonics. He's completely dead, I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; very sad to say.</i><br>
<p>
Dr. Sagan, in his book "Broca's Brain", tells of coming across the <br>
preserved  brain of Paul Broca (an 19th century scientist) in an anatomy <br>
collection.  He speculates that perhaps, in some fundamental way, <br>
Paul Broca was still there.  This was my first introduction to the <br>
chain of ideas that led to cryonics.  This makes his death especially <br>
sad for me.<br>
