Art is the expression of our deepest values.<br>
<p>
Some value beauty, and they create beautiful objects.<br>
<p>
Some value grace, and they move their bodies fluidly, with elegance.<br>
<p>
Some value clarity, and they develop a deeper understanding of the world.<br>
<p>
Some value efficiency, and they create machines to accomplish their goals.<br>
<p>
Art is the expression of our deepest values.<br>
<p>
We create technology, as a form of art.<br>
<p>
Our technology is an expression of what we value.<br>
<p>
Our Civilization is a result of Humanity expressing its values.<br>
<p>
Civilization is an art form which humans create.<br>
<p>
Art is the expression of our deepest values.<br>
<p>
Extropians value Extropy.<br>
<p>
We value intelligence, creativity, complexity.<br>
<p>
The Extropian life is an art form.<br>
<p>
We use our lives to increase Extropy in all we can.<br>
<p>
To be fully Extropian is the greatest challenge.<br>
<p>
It means far more than simply being excited about the future and new <br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
It requires a deep commitment to the Extropian Values.<br>
<p>
It requires an intense self-discipline, to be clear about our values and to <br>
express them skillfully.<br>
<p>
Art is the expression of our deepest values,<br>
<p>
And the Extropian life is a form of art.<br>
<p>
