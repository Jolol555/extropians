The organism isn't static either and would be engineered to keep apace with<br>
the brain. Besides, genetic engineered or 'wet' uploads will likely come<br>
before 'dry' nano uploads and I want in ASAP. With a static brain you're<br>
left with nothing more than a duplicate or digital clone of you. I don't<br>
want a clone living for me! I want to be in the virtual world! I'm willing<br>
to bet most common people would agree that gradual uploads are the way to<br>
go. Thats just my opinion.<br>
