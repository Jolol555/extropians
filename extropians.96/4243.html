I  have missed the beginning of this thread, because I was off the list for<br>
awhile moving back to the Mainland... but it strikes me as odd that someone<br>
should suggest redefining extropy (the word or term, not one's own personal<br>
extroping) on an online list or forum. <br>
<p>
Was it supposed to be re (or better)defined by all of us, on an email forum?<br>
Wouldnt it have been better protocol to arrange a meeting with Max and<br>
discuss it, or some other place, and then work with the Institute in a<br>
positive way?<br>
I usually send people to the website (not here)  if they are curious to know<br>
what I mean when I say I'm an Extropian. They usually come back with a very<br>
clear idea of the principles.<br>
<p>
Either way,IMHO obviously Extropy (as well as transhumanism) is a new<br>
philosophy and far from being RE-definable is still an ongoing exploration of<br>
 still to be refined and exciting ideas. It, by its very NATURE, gets<br>
better... by definition, it expands..<br>
