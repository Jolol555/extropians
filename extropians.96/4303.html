<i>&gt;What affect does music have on the experience?  [snip] It's affects </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the delta/theta/alpha/beta system? Singing. Chanting.  Oxygen </i><br>
<i>&gt;deprivation?  Aldous Huxley, in "Heaven and Hell", states the reason </i><br>
<i>&gt;for singing in religion, all of the repetitive speach, is to deprive </i><br>
<i>&gt;the individual of oxygen, inducing visions of god, which are nothing </i><br>
<i>&gt;more than hallucinations.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps Huxley was thinking of Buddhist monks chanting all day long, </i><br>
<i>&gt;which implies that meditation as well as the mental focus it brings is </i><br>
<i>&gt;simply a hallucination due to oxygen deprivation?</i><br>
<p>
Too much effort. Why waste time? Drop a tab. :)<br>

(Doesn't 'believe' in God, or have much use for Faith, but occasionally<br>
enjoys church for picking up on girls. :) BTW, perhaps I was just<br>
unfortunate that demons and warnings about Hell were part of my childhood<br>
religious experience.)<br>
