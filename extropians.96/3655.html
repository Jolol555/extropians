<i>&gt; &gt; When a protein embedded in a membrane encounters a certain </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; molecule, it reacts -- it suddenly changes its mode of vibration, and   </i><br>
<p>
Uh, not "mode of vibration", let's say a change in conformation. Reaction <br>
is a bit much, it is usually reserved to denote encounters resulting in <br>
connectivity change. Here the stuff bonds to a specific spot, the overall <br>
conformation changes. It can be further amplified if this change makes a <br>
protein to become active/nonactive, e.g. release a signal, open an ion <br>
channel, become catalytically active, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; this change reverberates all over the membrane, causing further changes </i><br>
<p>
All over the membrane? The membrane is a semiflud 2d mosaic, a 2d <br>
liquid crystal. This won't work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the vibrations of all other proteins embedded in the membrane.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As a result of one molecule encountering one protein, pores may </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; open or close all over the membrane, as other proteins react to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; change in vibration of the sensor protein.  </i><br>
<p>
This is not mediated through the membrane. The closest thing to your <br>
scenario is a transient breakdown of an transmembrane potential <br>
(laboriously maintained by pumping stuff, while burning ATP), which <br>
causes a depolarization, a kind of chain reaction causing ion channel in <br>
the vicinity to open up as well. This defines an excitable medium, able <br>
to propagate signals over spatially large regions of the membrane. (Most <br>
of cell types don't express this). The lipide bilayer has no active part <br>
in this phenomenon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; That's how membranes work.  At a very low temperature, such </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pulsations would not exist.  The atoms would be nearly motionless.  </i><br>
<p>
At low enough temperatures membranes undergo a phase transition. It will <br>
denaturate a large percentile of transmembrane- and membrane-embedded <br>
proteins, which (transiently or permanently) will cease to function.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Therefore biological membranes require temperatures in a certain range.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Below that range, one would have to use other mechanisms to replace </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; membranes. </i><br>
<p>
Membranes must offer 2d fluidity to function. Biological organisms adapt <br>
to temperature change by changing the chemical composition of the <br>
membrane to remain in the optimal range. The window of adaptability has a <br>
pretty small aperture, however.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I have never heard of this phenomenon.  It would be interesting and</i><br>
<p>
Nor me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; surprising if this is really how information is transported to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; various proteins within membranes.  I would think the (thermal?) vibrations</i><br>
<p>
By physical means, either chemical messengers, or transmembrane potential <br>
changes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; of the proteins would be swamped with other thermal noise within the</i><br>
<i>&gt; membrane environment and be unable to propagate for any distance. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this a real effect, or is this just one of Lyle's games?</i><br>
<p>
Games.<br>
