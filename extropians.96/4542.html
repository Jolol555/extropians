I know that there IS a civil war operating at a low intensity as even<br>
geurrilla wars go, that mainly involves drugs. I posited this to Max M<br>
in my previous post on the right to bear arms. I however do not consider<br>
it to have reached such a level to "warrant" having capital letters put<br>
on it for history. If an agency like the NSA were to do as Lyle claims,<br>
you have no idea what a firestorm will erupt as a result. I personally<br>
know of at least a few thousand people within a 30 mile radius of my<br>
house that would shoot to kill any federal agent if such a state of<br>
affairs were to occur. They are currently  very patriotic and law<br>
abiding citizens who are in full support of the current government<br>
position on the drug war.<br>
<p>
All it takes is enough people's oxes to get gored by the government<br>
bully to really start something.<br>
