<p>
A fine maxim it is too, just follow it and you will become rich, although I <br>
admit it's sometimes easier said than done. I am also as certain as I am of  <br>
the Laws of Thermodynamics that it is impossible to do the reverse, at least  <br>
not for long.       <br>

<i>                &gt;How many children don't get an education because they have                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to work in sweatshops in order to support themselves. India                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;is a good example of capitalism running amuck. </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their <br>
children less than we do? The reason they send their young children to work <br>
in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and death, you've <br>
said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to <br>
stop this child labor, the thing that let's them survive, and that doesn't  <br>
seem like a very smart thing to do, and it CERTAINLY doesn't seem very  <br>
humane.<br>
 <br>
Only about 6 or 7 percent of the people on this planet have what you or I  <br>
would consider an acceptable standard of living, at most one in a thousand  <br>
lives in a way we would envy, most people live in appalling poverty. <br>
No matter how you divide up the pie, the average person is going to be living <br>
in intolerable conditions until we get a bigger pie. The Free Market is very  <br>
good at creating wealth, if History has taught us anything it is that  <br>
Socialism is not. You have virtually admitted as much in your posts, that's <br>
why you don't want to let me do my Capitalist thing, but I have no fear of  <br>
you doing your  Socialist thing. We both know how such a contest will end up.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I see something immoral in keeping a section of populace as                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;cheap reserve labour for our needs. Like those Pocahontas                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;shirts made in Haiti by  women paid seven cents an hour </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Would it be more moral to fire 99 workers and pay the remaining one 7$ an <br>
hour, or fire 999 workers and pay the remaining one 70$ an hour? Yes I know, <br>
I should pay 1000 workers 70$ an hour, but I simply wouldn't have the money to <br>
do that because nobody would buy my shirts because nobody could afford them.<br>
                             <br>
You seem to think you would be doing the Haitian people a great favor if you  <br>
could get me to junk my entire Haitian operation and fire everybody. Stop <br>
theorizing and ask the workers involved if they think you're their friend, <br>
but do it over the phone not in person, I'm afraid they'd try to lynch you.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;Putting up electric fences and hoarding resources with                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;superior firepower is not accepted by most people. </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
If you are looking for a workable system in which force is never used, you  <br>
will be looking in vain forever. The best we can hope for is to minimize it.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I am looking into starting a software co-op  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I don't think software is a good candidate to a co-op. While the difference  <br>
between a good programmer and a poor one is no greater than in other fields, <br>
the difference between a good programmer and a great one is huge. To these <br>
prodigies your co-op will not look very attractive and you'll be stuck with a<br>
lot of mediocre people; but give it a try, I could be wrong, the more <br>
experimentation the better I say.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Answering a question of who determines need: In small scale                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;operations [...] Co-ops don't work well on a large scale </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Then why are we talking about them? You're writing about changing the social <br>
structure of the world, nothing "small scale" about that.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;it's quite easy to spot who's not carrying their fair share                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;or is hoarding too much </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Again we have the "quite easy", perhaps it's easy on Planet Suresh but not  <br>
on Planet Earth. "Hoarding" by its nature is a secretive activity, you can <br>
only tell I'm doing it if you're smarter than I am, and you're certainly not <br>
smarter than everyone. Perhaps I do work less than you, but that may be <br>
because I'm smarter than you and work more efficiently. Do you really want to <br>
discourage initiative and productivity? There is nothing "quite easy" about <br>
all this, you'll need to have your thought police monitoring me every second.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;and to have a chat with them. </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Chatting may not be enough. When you tell people that the house they have <br>
built with their own two hands is too good for them and you have come to  <br>
confiscate it, I fear they will tell you to do things that may not be <br>
anatomically possible. To be obeyed you're going to need an army, and a  <br>
big one.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;If you don't like it, leave the commune. </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Excellent! Fine! You don't have to tell me twice! I am out of here!   <br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;This is made easier because there is no tie to property.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Maybe not in the commune but I'm out of that hell hole.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;If one commune screws up, the people can leave and go their                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;individual ways.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
And my "individual way" is Capitalism.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;you can do what you want. But you can't infringe on anybody                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;else. That means you can't take property and keep it from                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;everybody else. </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Now you're going backward. I'm not bothering you, why not let me do my thing <br>
and you do yours? Just order your subjects not to have any dealings with me,  <br>
perhaps they'll obey freely, and if not you always have the Thought Police.  <br>
As long as I'm not living in your commune what do you care what I do?  This <br>
is exactly the asymmetry in our positions I was talking about.<br>
            <br>
