        It would not be a pretty sight if we were to abolish the copyright<br>
law...especially for the one who has the copyright.  If the copyright law<br>
were to be removed then the 'rightee' would have no real claim to his work.<br>
The fact that the 'rightee' knows that it was he who did the work in the<br>
first place provides some solace, but not a lot.  The problem of royalties<br>
arises (pardon me for my present-day capitalistic views), and the 'rightee'<br>
stands the risk of not being acknowledged for his work.  If it doesn't<br>
belong to the *creator* of the work, who does it belong to?  Society?  I'm<br>
sorry, but that sounds pretty socialist to me --no offense to socialists of<br>
course.  The copyright law ensures the security of the individual(s) who<br>
created something.<br>
Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with that.<br>
