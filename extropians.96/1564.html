          I am in maximal agreement with the sentiments expressed by <br>
          Robin Hanson, Peter Ross (and Michael Butler?).<br>
          <br>
          I wish to add one thing: It is of particular importance that <br>
          there exists a list for serious discussion of transhumanist <br>
          issues, because there is as yet no established academic <br>
          forum in this area. I think the present list serves this <br>
          purpose very imperfectly and that there might be a need for <br>
          a transhumanist elite list, which should in the long run aim <br>
          to approach the academia as regards standards of <br>
          contributions and comments. We could hope for a positive <br>
          feedback mechanism here, as a better list would attract <br>
          better contributors.<br>
