<i>&gt; &gt;You are kidding, aren't you?  5 years?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok so maybe I was a little over optimistic :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess I was a little euphoric over the success of the current Hotwired</i><br>
thread.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
How is the thread a success, in the larger scheme of things?  What<br>
does "success" mean in this context?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Besides which, seen from my own extropian perspective, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unnecessarily bellicose to talk of annihilation of competing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;memesets.  Better to speak of ours "outcompeting" theirs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah but wouldn't outcompeting mean annihilation? We need to spread the meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; as far and wide as possible to get it to the masses as quickly as possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; so as to speed things up even more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This won't happen if you express your desired outcomes in the language<br>
of destruction.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All threads must die eventually. Now that the main debate between Max and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Paulina is over, the thread will wither and die because there is no one to</i><br>
<i>&gt; direct it and prevent it from becoming a general topic zone. Maybe you</i><br>
<i>&gt; joined the thread a little too late. Sorry.</i><br>

Pardon?  I was referring to a _peak time_ in the thread.<br>
