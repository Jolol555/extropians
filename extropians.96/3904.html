<i>&gt;Wishful thinking.</i><br>
<p>
No, Optimistic thinking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1) Without any type of server-side software, there will be strict limits on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the range and complexity of dynamic content.  About the most you could do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the Java applets would amount to eye candy.  For the really ambitious,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it would be possible to get around this via cleverly designed CGIs and Java,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the performance would be poor and significantly limited in scope.</i><br>
<p>
Have each room be a server where any person who enters the room will<br>
communicate with a java applet exactly the same as java chat applets work<br>
today. Besides you only need to know data specific to what avatars are in<br>
your field of vision. We could use IRC as well but then we'd have to deal<br>
with the problem of netsplits. Any way you put it, we want as much<br>
unlimited uninhibited creation by anyone. This has the potential to bring<br>
about a new phase of the internet's growth. The net went through a<br>
militarized age, a scientific age, and now possibly a transhumanist age<br>
which will spread memes even further and incorporate the ideas into all<br>
aspects of life as the internet grows to be the unified universal medium as<br>
important as electricity, air and water.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As mentioned above, inter-client communication *requires* server-side</i><br>
software.<br>
<p>
Great, so let everyone be a server.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Fortunetly USR has a monopoly on this scene so most of us will come through</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ok. Can't satisfy everyone unfortunetly but thats the way it is. Most of us</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;won't be able to run it as well until we all upgrade to Pentium MMX</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;200mhzs. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The compatibility issues isn't with the hardware, but with the types of</i><br>
<i>&gt;telco connections used.  However, a large percentage of ISPs use the</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriate types of telco connections, so you probably won't have a problem.</i><br>
<p>
Oops, sorry. I was referring to us not being able to use the VRML world in<br>
the first place without powerful PCs.<br>

If you build it, they will come! -Field of Dreams<br>
