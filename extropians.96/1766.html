A decade or two from now, cytoplasmic technology will reach the point <br>
where we can design made-to-order cells.  <br>
<p>
We will be able to design a very small "monitor cell" whose job it is <br>
to insinuate itself into the brain, and, in conjunction with millions of <br>
other such cells, keep track of everything that goes on in there.  <br>
(By "very small" I mean smaller than a nerve cell; small enough to fit <br>
between nerve cells without taking up too much space and without <br>
disrupting the activities of the nerve cells.) <br>
<p>
If we are going to have a very fine-grained model of the brain, <br>
something like this will have to happen.  We have to have sensors <br>
in there, picking up real-time information about how the neurons work, <br>
and this has to happen while the brain is "on," so to speak.  When we <br>
send the first monitor cells into the brain, this will be like sending   <br>
space probes to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc.  We will learn a lot about the <br>
brain that couldn't be learned any other way.  <br>
<p>
Now, once the monitor system is in place, since we are assuming <br>
a high level of expertise in cellular engineering, it will be possible to <br>
identify defective nerve cells and replace them.  It will also be <br>
possible to improve the healthy cells to make them work even better, <br>
and to enhance their communication with each other.  Entirely new <br>
kinds of nerve cells can be introduced, with new capabilities.  <br>
<p>
We will also be able to design and make cells that can (1) remove toxins <br>
(lead, aluminum, etc.), and (2) identify and repair gross problems,  <br>
such as calcification of tissue, plugged arteries, hormonal imbalance, <br>
and irregular electrical rhythms.  These cells can be incorporated into <br>
the immune system, so our bodies will be self-repairing.   (Of course <br>
our bodies are already self-repairing to a great extent, but there is plenty <br>
of room for improvement.)  <br>
<p>
Cellular engineering also has many industrial uses, such as extracting <br>
fresh water from sea water, extracting metals from ores -- I could go on <br>
and on.  I'm not saying cellular engineering will create a cornucopia, <br>
but it will allow us to do a lot of things that we can't do now.  <br>
<p>
Best of all, it doesn't depend on Genies or any kind of hocus-pocus.  <br>
It's a very straightforward development of the cell biology of today.  <br>
