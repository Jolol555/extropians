<i>&gt;The fact that any one human can have such diverse thoughts shows that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have the diversity of thought to communicate with many different modes</i><br>
<i>&gt;of intelligent existence. Now I know the first objection is gonna be</i><br>
<i>&gt;"What about the whales? we can't understand them and they have such big</i><br>
<i>&gt;brains they MUST be intelligent." Wrong. Their minds are almost totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;occupied with  the vast signal processing required by their sonar</i><br>
<i>&gt;system. Did you know that they can create a sonic image of the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;pacific ocean? That takes major processing. That does not leave much</i><br>
<i>&gt;room for abstract thought. Plus if you look at their brian mass to body</i><br>
<i>&gt;mass ratio, they would still be far below humans, as are all othr earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, there are a few cetaceans that have a higher brain mass to body<br>
mass ratio that humans.  The dolphin is one of them.  The dolphin also has a<br>
more convoluted brain than humans.  They exhibit complex intelligent speech<br>
patterns as well.<br>
<p>
I disagree about the signal processing issue, though.  Cetaceans have<br>
excellent audio capabilities, but mediocre, non-stereoscopic vision and<br>
vision processing.  Humans have mediocre audio capabilities, but very good<br>
visual processing capabilities.  Humans receive something like 90% of their<br>
sensory input through their eyes.<br>
<p>
I used to work on DSP applications, mostly audio, but occasionally graphics<br>
oriented.  Visual processing applications almost always require an order of<br>
magnitude more processing power than audio ones.  I have heard the argument<br>
before, but I have a difficult time believing that cetaceans use more of<br>
their brain for audio processing than we use for vision.  State-of-the-art<br>
audio rendering software can run in realtime on a processor capable of less<br>
than 200-mips.  <br>
<p>
Also, our hearing is more capable than most people think.  I have seen<br>
experiments where blind people were able to echo-locate objects with a cross<br>
section of 1 square inch in a room using their own voice, and could detect<br>
changes in position of 3" at a distance of 15' of objects with a<br>
cross-section of 1 square inch.  Non-blind people tend to only have a range<br>
of 3-7', but everyone possesses the capability.  I actually took one of<br>
these tests.  My effective range was 5-6'.  Most people don't know they can<br>
do it until they try.<br>
