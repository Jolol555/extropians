<i>&gt; Generally, Dery (the author) is skeptical of the "antisocial"</i><br>
<i>&gt; aspects of transhumanism, and he mentions Extropians in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; light.  His attitude is much like mine, though he is less</i><br>
<i>&gt; enthused about such things as downloading the mind than I am.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; He interviews Moravec, and asks him what downloading of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind means for the downtrodden billions who don't even have</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers.  Moravec says, basically, "tough luck for them;</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans are becoming obsolete, so a few billion more or less</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't make much difference."  Dery finds this unconsciounable.</i><br>
<p>
I think the extropian meme has succeeded in establishing itself as a <br>
commonly known term for a certain social type, like "biker" or "wigger" <br>
or "yuppie."  Or "Satanist."  Apparently the public has a rather sinister <br>
perception of extropians, taking Moravec as the prototype of the <br>
overman who wants to become a cyborg and destroy the world.  <br>
<p>
How wrong is this perception?  Is there anyone here who is not <br>
fascinated by such thoughts?   I was thinking along those lines in 1965, <br>
when I read "Profiles of the Future" by Arthur C. Clarke.  <br>
<p>
If Moravec is *not* a prototypical extropian, then the meme has a serious <br>
public relations problem.  Dery's book was a public relations disaster.  <br>
But then, memes are as selfish as genes, and will find their own way to <br>
survive.  Memes decide which other memes to mate with, and their <br>
parents can't always control their choices.  <br>
<p>
Beyond PR, there is the question of what to do about Moravec, and <br>
others who entertain fantasies -- not necessarily idle fantasies - about <br>
setting forces in motion that would kill billions of obsolete people.  <br>
The question is not what to say, but what, if anything, to do.  If you <br>
knew that someone intended to kill almost everybody on the planet, <br>
except for a remnant who would be protected -- what would you do?  <br>
Join him?  Assasinate him?  or do nothing?  <br>
<p>
