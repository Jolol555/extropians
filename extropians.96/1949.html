You are right.  I am (partly) wrong.  I still disagree with all forms of<br>
socialism and Suresh Naidu.  Even his anarcho-socialism.  But, you are right,<br>
too.  I have taken too much of a view that a lot of people are (in your words<br>
describing your idea of John's position)  ". . .  are fully aware of the<br>
choices that they make and have the critical faculties and/or ability to<br>
empower themselves and do that which is in their best interests."  <br>

I like to be an optimist.  But, you have a very good point.  A lot of people<br>
_are_ "fooled"       I'm sorry, that was a bad choice of words.      I should<br>
say,  "memed" into believing they must be told what to do, must obey or get<br>
punished.  They are memed into something like (what Dr. Martin Seligman says<br>
is) "Learned Helplessness" by either religions or governments.  It's amazing<br>
to me that so many people don't know how free they are or how free they could<br>
be.  <br>
<p>
This reminds me of Harry Browne's book _How I Found Freedom in an Unfree<br>
World_.  That book should be read by everyone on earth.  If they disagree<br>
with the main (freedom) idea of that book, they are "free" to get what they<br>
get.  <br>
