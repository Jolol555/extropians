Eric:<br>
<i>&gt;I get a funny feeling participating in this discussion. Is there anyone on</i><br>
<i>&gt;this list who could reasonably be accused of being servile? Thought not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why are we discussing this? Reilly, if you want to crush the servility</i><br>
<i>&gt;meme, you are preaching to the choir here. I'm with Hagbard Celine: "Non </i><br>
<i>&gt;serviam, baby."</i><br>
<p>
You can certainly *accuse* anyone of being servile.  Being servile<br>
doesn't necessarily have to be bad for the accused, though.  We're in<br>
the values arena again: who's to say what's good for you?  Yourself,<br>
of course.  But what if you're brought up in such a way as to sincerely<br>
believe that serving other people is the right way?  Again, you can<br>
*accuse* your parents/guardians/state/whatever of brainwashing you, but<br>
that's just stating that your set of values is different from their set<br>
of values.  I have figured out quite some time ago that individual<br>
happiness is not correlated with the social structure at all.  I'd<br>
rather concentrate on fostering those virtues of people that let them<br>
accomplish more in terms of what I think of as magnificent, but that<br>
statement *implies* my desire for some servility from the subjects.<br>
Language is such.<br>
<p>
<p>
Reilly:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; And individuals can never learn to obey themselves - that is, develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; self-control - unless they have learned to obey someone above them.</i><br>
<p>
Eric:<br>
<i>&gt;I vigorously disagree. People learn to govern themselves by being expected</i><br>
<i>&gt;to govern themselves, preferably by their parents, from earliest</i><br>
<i>&gt;childhood.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, I smell a semantic snag here.  How is governing oneself according<br>
to someone else's expectations different from obedience?  Or to rephrase<br>
the question: how many kids do you have, Eric?  I don't think I fully<br>
understand both claims, but I tend to side with Reilly.  An unquestionable<br>
authority is absolutely crucial for a child's early development.  Kids'<br>
brains undergo several phase transitions, as I have witnessed with<br>
fascination.  The problem begins where that authority stays unquestionable<br>
beyond formative years, and where it extends beyond home.  But I'm no<br>
expert on child psychology, and furthermore, it's just a personal view<br>
of how *I* think people should be brought up nowadays (guiding by example).<br>
It's beyond doubt that many magnificent accomplishments of human race were<br>
the fruit of slave labor.<br>
<p>
<p>
Eric:<br>
<i>&gt;We disagree about the sorts of cultural conditions that produce </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-governing individuals. I say people who are consistently expected to </i><br>
<i>&gt;govern themselves learn how to do so and usually do a pretty good job.</i><br>
<i>&gt;People who are consistently expected to submit to authority can never </i><br>
<i>&gt;learn how to govern themselves except through luck and canniness.</i><br>
<p>
But the two are the same!  All people govern themselves to the extent<br>
they perceive they have to in order to maximize their goals in life.<br>
The other crucial ingredient is to teach them when to lead and when to<br>
follow, and this simply doesn't make any sense unless they know authority.<br>
You are only stating "they should all have my set of values" in different<br>
words.  Most of us act so (those who don't are poor specimens in<br>
evolutionary terms), and some of us are self-conscious enough to realize<br>
this and discuss it via mailing lists.<br>
<p>
<p>
Reilly:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; For the last five years, the operating</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; principle of the public schools has been that no one will be more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; educated than the least educated.</i><br>
<p>
Eric:<br>
<i>&gt;This is one reason why I'm more concerned about getting the government out</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the education business than I am about changing the lifestyles of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;hippie neighbors.</i><br>
<p>
Two questions:<br>
  Eric, who do you think should be in charge then, and what's to stop<br>
        the market from simply bankrupting education?<br>
  Reilly, where should concerned parents send their five years olds in<br>
        order to evade their imminent metamorphosis into tabula rasae?<br>
<p>
<p>
