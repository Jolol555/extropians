Hal,<br>
<p>
I have realized that your misunderstanding of the dice rolling problem is due <br>
to the fact that you are considering only one instance of the experiment and <br>
considering it to be a statistical sample, when statistics and probability <br>
require *many* samples to become relevant.  So, let's set up the experiment so <br>
that it can be repeated many times, and then the actual odds of seing the <br>
double sixes come up during any one particular trial will become much clearer <br>
for you to understand.<br>
<p>
Imagine we have an arbitrarily large number of people to select from, to <br>
participate in the dice rolling experiment.  We could assign each person a <br>
group to be in, and each person will remain in their assigned group for each <br>
trial.  Group #1 would have one person in it.  Group #2 would have ten people. <br>
 Group #3 would have one hundred people, and so on, so that any group #n has <br>
10^(n-1)  (10 to the n-1 power) number of people in it.<br>
<p>
During each trial, group #1 will begin and have two *fair* dice rolled for it. <br>
 If double sixes don't come up for any particular group, the dice are rolled <br>
for the next group.  If double sixes come up for any group, the trial ends and <br>
the next trial begins, starting with group #1 again.<br>
<p>
Here are some probabilities for and other facts regarding various events:<br>
<p>
Because the dice are fair dice, every time they are rolled, they have a 1/36 <br>
chance of coming up double sixes.<br>
<p>
The person assigned to group #1 has a 100% chance of being included in the <br>
trial and a 1/36 (approximately .27778, which is 2.8%) chance of the dice <br>
coming up double sixes during that group's turn.  The second group has the <br>
remaining 35/36 (97.2%) chance that the dice *won't* come up double sixes for <br>
the first group and thus that the second group will get a turn.  They then <br>
have a 1/36 chance that the dice will come up double sixes during their turn, <br>
so their probability of seeing double sixes is  35/(36*36) (approximately <br>
.02701, which is 2.7%).  The third group has a 35/36 chance of the 35/36 <br>
chance that the second group had to get a turn (this is the probability that <br>
both groups #1 and #2 will not see double sixes), which is (35*35)/(36*36) = <br>
35^2/36^2 = 1225/1296 (94.5%), and of this chance, they only have a 1/36 <br>
chance of that, that they will see the dice come up double sixes.  So the <br>
probability of group #3 getting a turn AND having double sixes rolled on that <br>
turn is 35^2/36^3 (approximately .02626, which is 2.6%).  For any group #n, <br>
the probability that the group will get a turn AND that the dice will come up <br>
double sixes on that turn is 35^(n-1)/36^n  (35 to the n-1 power, divided by <br>
36 to the n power).  Thus, the chances of the later groups getting a turn and <br>
having double sixes come up becomes vanishingly small (group #100 has only a <br>
0.17% chance of this happening to it).<br>
<p>
After double sixes come up during any group's turn, the number of people in <br>
that group will *always* have more than nine times the number of people in the <br>
previous groups combined.  Incidentally, that means that for each trial, more <br>
than 90% of the participants will have been in the group that had double sixes <br>
come up for it.  However, that group's chances that they will get a turn and <br>
see the double sixes come up next time the trial is run is very small.   In <br>
fact, for every group up to group #127, there is a greater chance that NONE of <br>
the previous groups will see double sixes than there is that *that* group WILL <br>
have double sixes come up.  Also, during any group's turn, it is far more <br>
likely (35/36 chance) that some later group will get a turn and have double <br>
sixes come up then that *it* will have double sixes turn up (1/36 chance).<br>
<p>
So, for any given participant, their chances are very slim that they will <br>
actually get a turn AND that the dice will come up double sixes on their turn, <br>
and even if they do get a turn, their chances are only 1/36 that they dice <br>
will come up double sixes during their turn.<br>
<p>
It is true that for each trial, more than 90% of the participants will have <br>
the double sixes come up for them, but that doesn't mean that the same people <br>
have more than a 90% chance of having it happen again next time, and it <br>
*certainly* doesn't mean that *every participant* has more than a 90% chance <br>
of having double sixes come up during their group's turn.  You can't just look <br>
at the outcome of a single trial and then say that it's representative of <br>
every *possible* trial.  For any given individual, it's most likely that they <br>
won't see the dice come  up double sixes, and even the more than 90% that do <br>
see them come up will most likely be among the less than 10% that don't the <br>
next time they get a turn.  So, for any given individual, the safest bet is to <br>
bet that they won't see double sixes come up during their group's turn.<br>
<p>
You can track every individual among your arbitrarily large group of <br>
participants during every trial, and you can note how often each particular <br>
individual is in the group that saw double sixes come up, and you will see <br>
that during the times that an individual's group actually gets a turn, that <br>
individual typically sees the dice come up double sixes 1 out of every 36 <br>
times.  This is true statistics and true probability.  To determine the best <br>
bet for each individual, the trial must be carried out *many* times.<br>
<p>
The best bet for *every* individual in the trial is that double sixes will NOT <br>
show up for them.<br>
<p>
I hope you see that now; I have explained it about as thoroughly as possible <br>
without sounding too condescending.  Your "paradox" was trivial for me to <br>
solve, but I enjoyed the *real* challenge of trying to explain the solution to <br>
you in a convincing way that you couldn't avoid seeing it.  Thank you for the <br>
challenge.  Although I can't help wondering if you have only been *pretending* <br>
that you didn't understand, so that you could see what kinds of explanations <br>
you'd get.<br>
