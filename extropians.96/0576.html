After looking over suggestions and comments, as well as my intent by<br>
"Unlimited Individual Freedom", I have come to the following conclusions<br>
(while chasing my own tail out of the loop :-) about IF:<br>
<p>
	No adjective is needed in prefacing individual freedom to establish the<br>
point.  Individual freedom states cogently what I am after by the mere use<br>
of the words "individual" and "freedom."  I could say autonomous freedom,<br>
but individual sounds better.<br>
<p>
	Placing an adjective in front of the Individual Freedom can be superfluous:<br>
<p>
	"Unlimited" - a search for obtaining open-ended IF.  This was a broad reach<br>
for something greater, better, never-ending.  It sounded far-reaching, but<br>
actually it was excessive.<br>
	"Maximum" - a search for obtaining the most IF.  This was another choice<br>
while looking for the ultimate, best and, again, greatest freedom I could<br>
obtain.  In that freedom is without restriction and restraints, maximum, is<br>
over-kill by what is stated by the very word "freedom."<br>
	"Dynamic" - (great sound!, but again, for me, not necessary for same reasons.)<br>
<p>
	What I have been searching for in defining unlimited individual freedom,<br>
and why it has taken me so long to accomplish this is that I have not, up<br>
until now, realized that trying to make IF more individual or more free is<br>
redundant.<br>
<p>
	My strategy is to further develop cognitive abilities to utilize IF to the<br>
fullest.  Not develop the idea IF to the fullest.  This way, I am placing<br>
emphasis on the complexities and motivations of my individual pursuits.<br>
This combines a lot of psychological implementations in behavior while<br>
developing optimally my Transhuman aims.  (Limitless thinking - maximum<br>
commitment - dynamically optimistic)<br>
<p>
UIF: "The search for obtaining a never-ending freedom by expressing an<br>
open-ended individuality."  It was simply a search.  <br>
