Hal Finney paraphrases David Brin: "Encryption must be banned!"<br>
<p>
It is impossible to ban encryption, at least not the really good stuff, <br>
because you don't even know the encryption is there; the message looks like <br>
any other message.  That's the whole *point* of cryptography.  By its very <br>
nature it will be secret and undetectable without the proper knowledge, which <br>
is also secret.  One day, we're going to be sending each other lots of music <br>
and video footage through computer networks.  It is fairly trivial to hide a <br>
message in video by altering the bits of the pictures which have the least <br>
effect on the appearance of the picture.  Someone who knows which bits you <br>
altered and how you altered them can pull your message out of the video.  That <br>
message can be encrypted as well, and so they have to run other algorithms on <br>
the message to decipher the intended message.  If someone had the original, <br>
unaltered video, they could compare it to the one with the hidden message and <br>
realize that a message had been hidden in it.  But eventually people will be <br>
sending each other videos which they recorded themselves, and then not leave <br>
any unaltered originals.  Then it would be impossible to even know that a <br>
message was hidden in the video, just by examining the video itself.  Video is <br>
just one medium of many that are excellent for concealing messages in, and <br>
clever, secretive people will use whatever they can to maintain privacy.<br>
<p>
Encrypted messages will be flowing all over the place and they will be <br>
completely invisible to anyone attempting to ban encryption.  There's not much <br>
we can do to prevent people from sending each other secret, encrypted <br>
messages.  For all you know, this sentence contains a hidden message, if you <br>
only knew the deciphering algorithm.<br>
