Okay, okay, I though some people wanted this thread to die, so I switched<br>
it over to private e-mail...but, if the rest of the list is interested,<br>
than okay.....<br>
But, I'm getting three messages, each longer than the first, in reply,<br>
each one of you are addressing points that I'd like to address as well,<br>
but I am a student, and I don't have time..So please forgive the brevity<br>
of my answers.<br>

<i>&gt; On Tuesday, October 8, 1996, Suresh Naidu wrote several things which I have </i><br>
<i>&gt; questions about.  His statements are in quotes, and my questions and  comments </i><br>
<i>&gt; (mostly comments) follow each quote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "My point is that competition cannot help worker conditions, nor can it </i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminate the authoritarian nature of business."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Why can't competition help worker conditions?  A worker is someone with a </i><br>
<i>&gt; commodity to sell, namely, their labor.  The factory owner or any other </i><br>
<i>&gt; employer is in the market for labor; they wish to purchase labor.  Just as you </i><br>
<i>&gt; would likely buy a product for the lowest price possible, the employer will </i><br>
<i>&gt; look for people who will sell their labor for the lowest price that gives the </i><br>
<i>&gt; employer the highest quality of work they can get for that price.  So there is </i><br>
<i>&gt; a competition among the workers to see who can provide the highest quality </i><br>
<i>&gt; labor at the lowest price, just as there is a competition between businesses </i><br>
<i>&gt; to provide the highest quality products at the lowest price.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	But there are a limited number of workers, especially workers who perform </i><br>
<i>&gt; high quality labor.  So there is a competition among employers to attract the </i><br>
<i>&gt; high quality workers to work for them, rather than someone else.  So, they </i><br>
<i>&gt; offer higher wages then their competitors, to attract the better workers.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus, the competition between workers holds their wages down, while the </i><br>
<i>&gt; competition between employers for high quality labor tends to raise the wages. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But, of course, only the workers who are willing to train themselves to </i><br>
<i>&gt; perform high-quality labor will benefit from this competition between </i><br>
<i>&gt; employers.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	So, you're right, I suppose; workers who produce shoddy work will not benefit </i><br>
<i>&gt; from competition, just as businesses who produce shoddy products will not </i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit from competition.  But, and this is very important, people who take </i><br>
<i>&gt; the time and effort to develop their skills and talents, to better themselves </i><br>
<i>&gt; and produce high-quality labor and products, WILL benefit from competition.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; People will tend to purchase the products and labor that they offer, rather </i><br>
<i>&gt; than from someone else.  I don't imagine that you deliberately buy inferior </i><br>
<i>&gt; products at nearly the same price as much higher-quality products.  Nor do I </i><br>
<i>&gt; think you would hire some slothful, sloppy worker who charged as much as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; very skilled, energetic worker.  It is because humans demand quality that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; system you bemoan exists. And it is because humans demand quality that we </i><br>
<i>&gt; progress at all.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You are correct when dealing with a high-level industry, such as computer<br>
software. However, in low-skill menial labour, which is usually allocated<br>
to people based on geography or class, not skill. There is a limit to the<br>
number of carpets people can put out in a day. Most of our crap jobs are<br>
given to people in other lands, imposed on them by businesses that buy the<br>
land out from underneath people by striking deals with whatever authority<br>
is already in place. Then they put the people in a state of serfdom.<br>
Businesses don't need to have any respect for the low end producers, just<br>
the high end consumers. Look at the clothing industry. <br>
	Even in high tech, there is severe disparity in wages. Some<br>
software companies import top-notch indian programmers, keep them in<br>
"software sweatshops" and pay them INDIAN wages. That strikes me as<br>
grossly unfair, because more highly educated and skilled people are being<br>
manipulated by sleazy managers.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Remember that our ancestors had little more than rocks, sticks, dirt and </i><br>
<i>&gt; other plants and animals to use.  This was all they had available to them, </i><br>
<i>&gt; until innovative people started using those resources to create something </i><br>
<i>&gt; better for themselves.  All our technology and wealth, beyond what our distant </i><br>
<i>&gt; ancestors had, exists because humans created it.  Don't expect that workers </i><br>
<i>&gt; will have any thing more than our ancestors did, unless they earn it.  They </i><br>
<i>&gt; must put forth the effort and create their own wealth, they can't expect that </i><br>
<i>&gt; those who do create wealth are going to just share it with them.  They need to </i><br>
<i>&gt; provide competitive labor and products, just like all the people who built </i><br>
<i>&gt; this great enterprise of Civilization have done.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Civilization was not built by slackers who moaned about the unfairness of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; world.  It was built by people who were willing to improve themselves and </i><br>
<i>&gt; provide better services and products than others could.  It was built by </i><br>
<i>&gt; people who were willing to put themselves in competition with others, to see </i><br>
<i>&gt; who could provide the best work and products, by people continually building </i><br>
<i>&gt; the self-discipline to compete successfully.  If some people aren't willing to </i><br>
<i>&gt; do this, then they don't deserve any more than our ancestors had, because if </i><br>
<i>&gt; our ancestors hadn't done all the work they did, they would never have had all </i><br>
<i>&gt; the wealth they created.  If people aren't up to the competition, then maybe </i><br>
<i>&gt; you could throw them scraps from the table of success, but to sit around that </i><br>
<i>&gt; table they must pull themselves off the floor, with their own effort and their </i><br>
<i>&gt; own self-discipline.  They must earn the right to sit around the table and </i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy wealth with the others who have earned the right to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	The Capitalist System is not some sort of magic milk machine with teats </i><br>
<i>&gt; sticking out all over for every freeloader to suck on.  It was never meant to </i><br>
<i>&gt; take care of anyone.  The Capitalist System arises because people have things </i><br>
<i>&gt; they want to sell to each other.  One person may build good huts while another </i><br>
<i>&gt; is good at hunting or growing food, so they make an agreement with each other </i><br>
<i>&gt; to exchange services.  That is all it is.  It is simply people trading what </i><br>
<i>&gt; they have for something else they want.  People sell to the highest bidder and </i><br>
<i>&gt; buy things for as little as possible.  To profit from this system of trading, </i><br>
<i>&gt; you must  be competitive with the others engaged in it.  Those who can't be </i><br>
<i>&gt; competitive simply won't find people who are willing to make an agreement to </i><br>
<i>&gt; trade with them.  And there is no reason to expect that anyone *should* trade </i><br>
<i>&gt; with them, if what they offer is much worse than what others offer.  You </i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't buy rotten apples from someone when the person next to them is </i><br>
<i>&gt; selling fresh apples for nearly the same price.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	The Capitalist System cannot be expected to save Humanity, especially not </i><br>
<i>&gt; from it's own stupidity and laziness.  These are just the hard facts of </i><br>
<i>&gt; reality.  People won't buy inferior products, when better ones are as </i><br>
<i>&gt; available.  Therefore, only the people who can provide better products </i><br>
<i>&gt; (including labor) than others will be able to secure a trade with others for </i><br>
<i>&gt; what they have to offer.  People have to look out for themselves in this </i><br>
<i>&gt; world; they can't expect others to just take care of them, especially if they </i><br>
<i>&gt; have little to offer in return.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, call me one of those crazy idealists, but what about if people<br>
worked to better each other rather than only themsleves. Science<br>
innovations could be shared by the entire commune. Everybody is working<br>
for the benefit of all. I  think  cooperation can produce the<br>
best item for the lowest price, simply because everyone contributes what<br>
they can. Of course, this requires a bit of social conscience, but I'm<br>
hoping we as a species get out of this greed rut and into something<br>
sustainable. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Yes, there is a great deal of "unfairness" within reality.  But that is </i><br>
<i>&gt; simply a result of reality not being uniform.  Reality will never be fair; all </i><br>
<i>&gt; we can do is just do the best we can with the resources we have available to </i><br>
<i>&gt; us.  This has always been true, even before humans evolved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	</i><br>
<p>
When other humans make it unfairer is what gets me<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "What I propose is this:Anarcho-syndicalism, as advocated by Rudolf </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rocker and Noam Chomsky, souped up into a hi-tech version by yours truly. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Private property is abolished, as the only way to hold </i><br>
<i>&gt; private property is by right of force, and since there is no need for a </i><br>
<i>&gt; government to keep people in check, that would be abolished as well. Most </i><br>
<i>&gt; crime comes from poverty, and the rest can easily be dealt  with by </i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens.  Okay, ask me questions."</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; "equal access to resources </i><br>
<i>&gt; to do with as you will, provided it doesn't harm </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone else's access or human rights. This needs </i><br>
<i>&gt; some elaboration, which I will provide if asked."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Are you serious about abolishing private property?  Do you think everyone has </i><br>
<i>&gt; a right to the work of others?  Lets say I spend a great deal of time and </i><br>
<i>&gt; energy building a house to live in.  Since you are advocating abolishing </i><br>
<i>&gt; private property, this would mean that after all my work, I most likely </i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't even get to sleep in the house since there are so many people out </i><br>
<i>&gt; there who would just love to sleep in my house for me.  People who don't want </i><br>
<i>&gt; to build their own houses would just wait for others to build houses and then </i><br>
<i>&gt; just move in when they're done.  The builders of the houses would never get a </i><br>
<i>&gt; place of their own, they would realize that continuing to build houses was </i><br>
<i>&gt; futile, since they'd never get to live in one, unless they forcefully kept </i><br>
<i>&gt; others from invading their work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Or what about a farmer?  They spend long hours each day tending their fields. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Are you really suggesting that everyone else should be allowed to just come </i><br>
<i>&gt; in like a swarm of locusts and take that food and not give the farmer anything </i><br>
<i>&gt; in return?  If so, then why would people want to farm?  They could just let </i><br>
<i>&gt; other people do it and then take the food from them when it's ready.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	What sort of resources are you suggesting we allow everyone equal access to?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; My computer is a resource which I spent many months paying for with my labor.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you suggesting I invite the whole neighborhood over to use it?  When would </i><br>
<i>&gt; I get a chance?  If everyone is supposed to have equal access to every </i><br>
<i>&gt; resource, then it would be very difficult to make anything.  If someone was </i><br>
<i>&gt; making a pot out of clay, for example, then the clay they're using is fair </i><br>
<i>&gt; game for anyone else to come along and take from them, since it's a resource, </i><br>
<i>&gt; even if they're in the middle of using it to make the pot.  Are you *really* </i><br>
<i>&gt; suggesting that they allow people to just take their work from them, rather </i><br>
<i>&gt; than block equal access to resources?</i><br>
<p>
No, people would all need to do something, but there is an<br>
element of compassion and interdependence. The farmer supports the builder<br>
of houses with<br>
food, while the builder of houses builds for the farmer, who possibly has<br>
enough to support a computer engineer, who would help hook the houses up<br>
to the net. It is mutual cooperation, instead of feeding parasites.<br>
Everybody puts their produce towards each other, without wanting<br>
than they need. Of course, as the technology level increases, the general<br>
level of everybody will increase, until humanity has fulfilled the<br>
extropian vision of ascension. Cooperation would work so much better than<br>
competition, because you get much more voluntary work. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Unless (gasp) the workers ran the mill themselves.  Operating a mill </i><br>
<i>&gt; better tends to mean "how much wages can I take away without reducing the </i><br>
<i>&gt; output of my workers. "</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	If the workers really *can* run the mill themselves, then why don't they get </i><br>
<i>&gt; together and decide to do just that?  Why can't a group of people all agree </i><br>
<i>&gt; together to run a business?  Most likely, the workers are not competent to run </i><br>
<i>&gt; the mill themselves or are not capable of working together effectively enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; to run a mill that can compete with other ones.  If it was more profitable to </i><br>
<i>&gt; run a mill where every worker runs the thing together, on equal footing, then </i><br>
<i>&gt; it would out-compete the ones which don't use this strategy.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	By the way, an increasing number of businesses are realizing that they do </i><br>
<i>&gt; better when the employees have feedback into how the business is run, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; they're using strategies such as profit-sharing to give their employees a real </i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in helping the company do better.  If these ways of doing business </i><br>
<i>&gt; are more profitable than other ways, then eventually, there *will* be </i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses that are run by the workers.</i><br>
<p>
My eventual goal, after university(nobody told me it would  be this<br>
difficult!), is to start a software co-op. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Suresh, I know you haven't explained your ideas in any detail, so I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; wish to attack them, since I'm unclear on what they really are.  But what </i><br>
<i>&gt; you've given so far, about not allowing private property and allowing equal </i><br>
<i>&gt; access to resources doesn't make any sense to me, for the reasons I indicated </i><br>
<i>&gt; above.  Please explain your ideas in more detail; put them forth into the </i><br>
<i>&gt; memetic competition, and let them be tested.  Give us equal access to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; resources of your mind and stop hoarding your ideas from us, after all you </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't own your own mind, that would be private property. :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
My fundamental moral principle is that all forms of coercion are bad,<br>
government and private property are pretty much the two biggest forms of<br>
coercion I can think of. You know about government coercion, but who backs<br>
up your right to property if not government. You and your superior<br>
firepower. Blatant application of force. <br>
<p>
See above,  but I can recommend some of the reading I draw on to formulate<br>
my views. <br>
<p>
Noam Chomsky, definitely on my most admired list.<br>
If who want a quick synopsis, the Chomsky Reader  is a good summary.<br>
