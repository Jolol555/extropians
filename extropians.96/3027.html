        Interesting.  My dictionary describes it as: "Inclination to look on<br>
the best side of life or to expect success" something I agree with<br>
whole-heartedly.  *Dynamic* optimism means optimism that has force behind<br>
it.  As dynamic optimists, extropians tend to try to attain progress rather<br>
than sit back and say "Gee, there will be progress some day."  We make our<br>
potential kinetic.<br>

        I'm sure lots of people have sent off responses while I am writing<br>
this, but I'll give you a low-down as *I* see it.<br>
<p>
        There is such thing as too much optimism, but can never be too much<br>
*dynamic* optimism.  Optimism on its own can be seen as 'wishful thinking'<br>
but when you add the dynamicism to it, you get wishful *doing*.<br>
As for the 'If this were a game...' question, I believe (and I think a lot<br>
of other extropian types agree) that the sum is greater than the whole of<br>
its parts when it comes to the human mind.  One might have little sense of<br>
diplomacy or 'Machiavellian wiliness' but still have a very strong will to<br>
attain progress and the dynamic optimism to see that it *can* be attained.<br>
If you know about Voltaire's classification system, extropians would be<br>
rational optimists.  Enough said.<br>
