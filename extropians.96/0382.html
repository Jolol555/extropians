I agree with you Douglas. I know what David was saying and I understand and<br>
appreciate it, but the way he said it will certainly cause mental barriers<br>
to go up. I checked the HotWired threads (up to a record 90 now) this<br>
morning and saw exactly the kinds of reactions you could predict. The<br>
frustrating "cult" accusation has popped up again. I'll compose a response<br>
to it this afternoon.<br>
<p>
Again, I encourage Extropians List subscribers to get involved with the<br>
discussion on Threads. On Friday at 11am pst you can also join Paulina and<br>
myself for a live discussion/debate.<br>
