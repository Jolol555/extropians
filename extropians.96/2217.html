<i>&gt; It's not a legal web, it's an economic one. However, if anyone wants to </i><br>

<i>&gt; the land, and they might even keep ties with society. Imagine a woodsman </i><br>
<i>&gt; opening a solar powered laptop to offer environmental reports.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, it's a legal web too.  If the woodsman goes off and lives<br>
off the land, sets up his solar-powered laptop and then sells his solar-<br>
generated power (or his computing facilities) to his neighbours, then<br>
the hand of State will grab him by his profits, even if they're zero.<br>
Try to ignore it and, ultimately, if you try to protect your personal<br>
standards, a pile of armed troopers with "legal" status will blow your<br>
brains out.  Law is only reasonable if you live within the envelope set<br>
by the law-makers, but step outside of it and reason no longer comes<br>
into it, let alone freedom of the individual.<br>
<p>
Law and freedom are, despite the best intentions of advocates, in practice<br>
at loggerheads.  It doesn't have to be so, as it's quite easy to conjure<br>
up laws that do not preset standards but merely enshrine an individual's<br>
rights to his own values;  unfortunately, today's lawmakers seem quite<br>
unable to grasp that concept, possibly because it entails a reduction in<br>
their power.  Whether this impasse can be overcome before that power is<br>
rendered inoperative by the effects of nano or net crypto is a matter of<br>
debate.<br>
