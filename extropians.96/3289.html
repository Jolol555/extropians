Some speculation from an amateur cognitive scientist: this seems to be<br>
similar to the problem many people with eidetic memories have: their<br>
memories do not generalize well, and hence do not form a coherent picture,<br>
just an endless pile of clear images (for an extreme imaginary example,<br>
read Borge's story "Fuentes"). <br>
<p>
Our memories are rather fuzzy, and usually contain more of our<br>
elaborations on experiences than the experiences themselves. This way we<br>
link them together into association chains and "the whole picture". Smart<br>
drugs may make imprinting memories much easier, creating eidetic-like<br>
memories that "stand alone". This is a bit like rote learning, where you<br>
cram your head with facts (very easy using mnemotechniques) but cannot use<br>
them, just recall them. If these speculations hold, then we might need to<br>
look for another kind of smart drugs, that helps us generalize and<br>
interlink memories rather than just store them. Perhaps this is one of the<br>
functions of sleep. <br>
