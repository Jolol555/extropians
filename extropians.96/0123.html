<i>&gt;Is there a web-based archive for the compleat former extropy list?</i><br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure none will be publicly available.  The former list was<br>
private, and you always needed to get permission from the person who<br>
posted to forward their post to someone else.  Putting up a public web<br>
site with the archive, if the archive exists, would involve either<br>
getting permission from a ton of people or getting blame from a ton of<br>
people because you didn't get permission.  Neither is attractive.  As<br>
a consequence, anything of value that happened on that list is<br>
essentially lost.<br>
<p>
I once asked why this was done, and at least one person who knew<br>
refused to tell me.  I am aware of two advantages of the old scheme:<br>
<p>
1. It allowed people to speak their views with some confidence that<br>
they wouldn't get back to their employer.  This is still possible with<br>
the present scheme; all you have to do is set up an anonymous remailer<br>
account and subscribe it to the list.  Doing it with the anonymous<br>
remailer is more secure than trusting that all the subscribers will<br>
respect the privacy of the list.<br>
<p>
2. In some people's minds it allowed sending copyrighted material to<br>
the list.  Since the list was "private", this was not "publishing".<br>
This seemed dubious to me.<br>
<p>
I do not think either of these advantages was the cause of the<br>
decision.  The brief refusal to explain the history of the decision<br>
mentioned AMIX (AMerican Information eXchange, now defunct), which<br>
leads me to guess that there was an earlier time when the list was not<br>
"private" and that someone tried to sell the archives of the list on<br>
AMIX at that time.<br>
<p>
History tends to repeat itself with more vigor when it is kept secret.<br>
If my guess is right, then the current way of running the list is such<br>
a repetition.  Is anyone who knows the history willing to speak up<br>
now?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is there at least one for the current one? Where can I find it?</i><br>
<p>
Quoting a message from David McFadzean &lt;david@lucifer.com&gt; on Thu, 25<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;You can find the hypermail archive at: <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/extropians/">http://www.lucifer.com/extropians/</a></i><br>
<p>
I have tried this and it works.<br>
