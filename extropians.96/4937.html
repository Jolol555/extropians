Well, using Heinleins example, whoever got there first would obviously<br>
control the resource. What those people did with the resource could be<br>
put up to an auction type vote: whoever pays the most decides what to do<br>
with it. If people truly don't want the moon winking corporate logos at<br>
them, they will have to pay the entrepreneurs sufficiently to keep them<br>
from using it for such a purpose.<br>
<p>
THis brings up an interesting question of jurisdiction. As national<br>
jurisdictions were determined originally to extend 3 miles from shore,<br>
as that was the furthest that a ground based cannon could shoot at that<br>
time, and was later extended to 12 miles for similar reasons, and since<br>
nobody currently has the ability to conduct an artillery barrage on a<br>
lunar target, the UN Moon and Space treaties are basically<br>
unenforceable. WHile you could argue that they would be enforcable on<br>
anyone returning from the moon to an earth jurisdiction, this leads to<br>
questions of extraterritorial enforcement that are currently being<br>
debated in the world court with respect to US laws designed to go after<br>
terrorists in overseas locations. <br>
<p>
Additionally, since water and other cryogenically stored materials are<br>
now being discovered at the lunar south pole, any lunar settlement would<br>
have plenty of light elements available to last until a comet could be<br>
diverted for a more lasting supply. Also, with the construction of<br>
linear induction accelerators for putting lunar resources into orbit,<br>
nobody on earth would be in a strategic position to tell anyone on the<br>
moon what to do, as such devices would be the ultimate in artillery<br>
weaponry in a position of tactical superiority over the entire earth.<br>
