<i>&gt;Your first view interprets the word "meaning" as entirely subjective, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;is certainly not what I intended.  What I'm trying to get at is whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is more to "the meaning of life" than just a collection of various</i><br>
<i>&gt;people's opinions.  Can we come up with some objective purpose(s)?</i><br>
<p>
        Here I get to use one of my favorite sayings: 'infinite<br>
possiblities, but only one truth.'  The amalgam of various peoples' opinions<br>
is truly one thing: self purpose.  That, I think, is as objective as you can<br>
get.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your second view strikes me as meaningless.  In essence, you are saying</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence is all the justification you need in defining your goals.</i><br>
<p>
        Not existance...life.  Huge difference.  While most people exist,<br>
and ponder on (no offense...example only) 'the meaning of life', others<br>
enjoy their life for what it is worth.  They enjoy the fact that they can<br>
create their own destiny.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is there a third view?  Does anyone here think there is a "purpose" to life</i><br>
<i>&gt;that does not require the existence of a creator/god/punisher?</i><br>
<p>
        I don't want to dwell on this --I believe that everyone has a right<br>
to their opinion-- but I cannot see how someone can live their life<br>
following someone\something they have not seen, heard or met.  To answer<br>
your question:<br>
yes, I do believe that there is a purpose to life that doesn't need some<br>
deus or 'higher force' to control.  My decisions and my pursuits (me being<br>
an atheist and all) are in no way hindered by the fact that I do not believe<br>
in a conventional 'God' or 'higher force'.  Is it not me who creates my purpose?<br>
I agree with extropian views because *I choose* to agree with them, not<br>
because I am a marionette of a god.  I am an artist...my work is not only<br>
poetry and music, but self-creation.  Is that not a purpose?<br>
