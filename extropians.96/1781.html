Many indigenous people were perfectly happy being self-sustaining and <br>
living off the land before greed fuelled colonialism robbed it from them. <br>
And colonialism helped the merchants and missonaries more than anyone.    <br>
<p>
Blame them both. The corporation that buys the land and chains the <br>
peasants to it is just as guilty as the faux government.<br>

Don't understand. If we don't have some form of sustainability, we're <br>
going to experience severe problems before nanotech has the capacity to <br>
reccle the past 200 years.<br>
 <br>

<p>
<p>
Yeah, there's the beef. But it doesn't take a lot of effort on the part <br>
of an individual to keep an anarchic society running. the work day would <br>
be drastically reduced. Nobody would have to work more than 2 hours a <br>
day. If everybody realized this was all it took to keep a smoothly <br>
running system, i don't think anybody would object. however, if somebody <br>
did do this, anarchism is a dynamic system, and can easily change to meet <br>
the demands of people.  <br>

<i>&gt; } food, while the builder of houses builds for the farmer, who possibly has</i><br>
<i>&gt; } enough to support a computer engineer, who would help hook the houses up</i><br>
<i>&gt; } to the net. It is mutual cooperation, instead of feeding parasites.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That happens today.  The farmer sells food to the builder and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineer, and uses the money to buy a house and a network connection and</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever else he can afford.</i><br>
<p>
No, because in above system, supply meets need, rather than demand. <br>
Profit is eliminated. There is no need to produce more than neccesary <br>
because nobody gains from it. Unlike today, where we have entire trawlers <br>
of grain empty themselves into the ocean because there is a surplus, but <br>
people don't want to give it away because it will lower the price.<br>

<i>&gt; } My fundamental moral principle is that all forms of coercion are bad,</i><br>
<i>&gt; } government and private property are pretty much the two biggest forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; } coercion I can think of. You know about government coercion, but who backs</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I kind of agree that "property is theft", at least I can share that</i><br>
<i>&gt; viewpoint.  But I haven't seen any alternatives.  I've read some</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kropotkin recently and was impressed by his criticisms.  But I could not</i><br>
<i>&gt; find exactly how he wanted society to actually work.  And then I read</i><br>
<i>&gt; some Hayek...</i><br>
<p>
Check out Anarcho-syndicalism. Admittedly, it needs some work to increase <br>
the technological progress  neccesary of a progressive society, but I <br>
really dig it. <br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you as familiar with the injustices under other systems?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Certainly, but everybody agrees the other major system, communism, is a <br>
dead ideology. Capitalism, the free market grail of so many people, has <br>
perpetuated the same crimes, but far subtler. Brave New World versus 1984. <br>
