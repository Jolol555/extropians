Dreams probably serve in a similar funtion to the scandisk/defrag<br>
functions on a computer. Imagine the entire database of information one<br>
stores from video, sound, touch, smell, and taste in just one day,<br>
enough to recall any detail under hypnosis. One would have to defrag<br>
once a day to keep it all organized for long term use.<br>
<p>
Actually uploading in one's sleep would not be a bad idea then, just<br>
inject an RNA code into the person to defrag the mind into this brand<br>
new hooked up capacity while spleeping, or even just part of it, to keep<br>
the body hooked up if that is wanted. it may take one night or as much<br>
as a whole year of nights to shift everything over. I imagine if it took<br>
one night that you'd have one hell of a chip-ache hangover in the<br>
morning.<br>
