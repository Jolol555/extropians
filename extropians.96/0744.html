<i>&gt;} Then how do you debunk christianity? I'm sure you have gone over this *much*</i><br>
<i>&gt;} more acutely and have some REALLY GOOD anti-christianity memes to share that</i><br>
<i>&gt;} punch solid holes through christianity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wow.  One of the times where I hope someone is being sarcastic at me</i><br>
<i>&gt;because their being serious is much scarier...</i><br>
Whats so scary about it? I just wish to cure a couple of friends and my<br>
parents from the horribly meme of christianity by using rational/logical<br>
thinking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your original point was</i><br>
<i>&gt;right: you don't easily punch holes through blind faith.  But faith</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't about stupidity.  It's about taking something on faith, or perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt;not subjecting something to criticism or consistency checks.  Subjecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;it to bad criticism won't help -- in fact it will give them good reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt;for not listening to you any further.  Likewise you don't counter bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;environmental arguments with bad counter-arguments.</i><br>
Why does the human brain react this way? Why can people blatently ignore the<br>
facts when they're sitting right in front of their face? Is it a bad<br>
byproduct of self-awareness or our creative side?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A dream of a meme</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a wonderful theme</i><br>
<i>&gt;or so we always do deem;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But a ream in a beam</i><br>
<i>&gt;causes termites to teem</i><br>
<i>&gt;or so it to me does seem.</i><br>
Happy Gilmore's response is: "Why don't I just eat some hay! I can make<br>
things out of clay, Lay down by the bay. I just may!"<br>
