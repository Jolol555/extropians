Of course, another fun way to stellify Jupiter is to drop one or more <br>
small black holes into its atmosphere. Just putting one into the core would <br>
heat it up quite a bit once it got large enough, but having a swarm <br>
orbiting in circular orbits in the higher layers might be even better: <br>
they absorb matter and radiate plenty of energy, and the hard radiation <br>
is absorbed by the atmosphere and reradiated as heat. This might even <br>
work for a longer time than a single "Jupiter into hole" detonation (but <br>
that would be *impressive*: at first the core would heat up, and probably <br>
expand, causing new weather patterns. Then the whole planet would begin <br>
to heat up, and then the hole would begin to grow exponentially as the <br>
planet simultaneously exploded and imploded). <br>
<p>
What I would like to hear if anybody knows how to calculate how much<br>
matter does flow into the hole, given that the temperature of the<br>
accretion disc is going to blow away a lot of matter too; I guess a state<br>
develops where radiation pressure and gravity balances each other. <br>

Is the visible range the best? I envision building tiny dyson spheres <br>
around singularities kept in place with electromagnetic fields and fed <br>
garbage matter so as not to grow to hot or cold. <br>

<p>
I think using grasers focused on a point was how Crane suggested it <br>
could be done. Bosons is probably the way to go, but they tend to be <br>
rather light. Maybe a Bose condensate could do the trick? The energies <br>
needed are large, but not impossible to come by if you have a dyson shell <br>
at your disposal. And once you have your hole factory, then you can bathe <br>
in energy... <br>
