<i>&gt;Suppose someone wants to bring about some event, and as a means of </i><br>
<i>&gt;doing so, propagates a meme.  What kind of causality is supposed to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;at work here?  </i><br>
<p>
Rhetorical causality. The same kind of causality that was used to <br>
establish the United States of America, for instance. Of course, it's<br>
very difficult to disentangle rhetorical causality from psychological<br>
causality, and the whole thing is very messy and historically embedded<br>
and context dependent, but it's an extremely important mode of <br>
causality because it is the primary mode that passes through human<br>
hearts and minds. If it weren't so important, I doubt there would be<br>
so many endowed chairs in the humanities for people to study this stuff.<br>
<p>
I think C. P. Snow's "Two Cultures" could be described as the people<br>
who are fascinated with the power of rhetoric (in its most general<br>
sense, which encompasses all the humanities) and the people who<br>
are fascinated with the power of mathematics. I remain fascinated<br>
by both, but I know where my own talents lie. It's funny watching<br>
the people who are wholly on one side or the other of Snow's boundary<br>
running around acting snooty and superior to the people on the<br>
other side. The humanists feel superior to the mathematically-competent<br>
because they suspect that many of the mathematically-competent<br>
people have no idea how much of their own motivations and assumptions<br>
have been shaped by the rhetoric of the past, both forgotten and<br>
remembered. I'm sure everyone here is familiar with the opposite<br>
snootiness displayed by the mathematically literate toward the<br>
mathematically incompetent.<br>
