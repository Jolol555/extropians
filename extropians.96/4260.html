Last weekend I taught a course at a private college on "Philosophical Issues<br>
of Artificial Intelligence". It was a two-day, 14-hour course in which I<br>
covered topics including intro AI and computing concepts, intro<br>
neuroscience, the mind-body problem (dualism, behaviorism, functionalism),<br>
the Turing Test, Searle's arguments, and... uploading.<br>
<p>
I found this an interesting experience. It seemed that by the end of the<br>
class (we discussed uploading late on the second day) most of the students<br>
were open to the possibility of uploading a human mind into a machine.<br>
Considering that many of the students are Catholic, that was surprising.<br>
This experience suggests that many people otherwise unwilling to consider<br>
the idea will open up to it (and to the idea of replacing biological with<br>
synthetic neurons) once they have the theoretical background in place. Too<br>
bad that we rarely get a chance to sit down with someone and talk with them<br>
about it for 14 hours!<br>
<p>
Also of note was the fact that several students managed to accept a<br>
material-functionalist account of mind despite continuing to believe in an<br>
afterlife and soul. On questioning, they admitted that they couldn't<br>
reconcile the ideas, yet they couldn't abandon either of them. One said that<br>
she simply had faith in God and an afterlife, while seeing the sense of the<br>
material position. Another said she didn't have a problem with holding<br>
contradictory beliefs. ... No, I was very polite to these students!<br>
<p>
I continue to be amazed at the capacity of the human mind for holding<br>
contradictions. This is one reason that I seriously doubt that religion will<br>
disappear with the continued advance of science and technology.<br>
