I suspect I wasn't making myself very clear, but what I had in mind was the<br>
step leading to language, which vastly accelerated memetic (or in other<br>
words, conceptual, or cultural) evolution so much that even though there<br>
are transmitted behaviors of nongenetic origin in other species, they play<br>
a drastically smaller role in the development of other species than they do<br>
in the development of our species.<br>
<p>
Since spoken language itself leaves zero fossil evidence, it's very<br>
difficult to date this particular step with any precision. It seems<br>
possible that cetaceans *may* have had this (I've done no research, I've<br>
just heard the claims) long before we did, but were hampered from making<br>
the same use of it by their lack of hands. If cetaceans do have full-on<br>
language (whatever that means), then that would pretty much blow away the<br>
candidacy of language-use for a significant part of the Filter.<br>
<p>
The candidacy also might be affected by the extremely limited research<br>
being done on the ability of other pongid species to transmit sign-language<br>
from parent to child without human intervention. I have done a bit of<br>
research on this, and language use by nonhuman apes is really not<br>
comparable, at least from the point of view of the role it could play in<br>
conceptual evolution. But if unassisted parent-child transmission of<br>
signing is stable and self-propagating, I'd probably want to back down on<br>
proposing language use as a big part of the Filter. Then again, it's<br>
*possible* that language use originated with a common ancestor of all the<br>
pongid apes, and that Homo sapiens was the only pongid species to retain<br>
it. It's probably very computationally expensive, and therefore would be<br>
selected against in most situations until it got well off the ground.<br>
<p>
I hesitate to put much credence in attempts to date the origin of spoken<br>
language by assuming that it closely correlates with some other more<br>
readily datable behavior, such as use of stone tools. It might have long<br>
preceded that, or it might even have come long after. I hope Simon! is<br>
listening in... are there any linguists in the house? But the last bit of<br>
paleolinguistics I read (a long time ago) was pretty vague on the dating of<br>
origins.<br>

<p>
This is what I've been thinking, though I'd say verbal brains relative to<br>
nonverbal brains. The brain is poorly understood and leaves little fossil<br>
evidence other than evidence of size. Language in and of itself is prima<br>
facie evidence for an important difference of organization between human<br>
and nonhuman brains.<br>
<p>
Is it possible that we passed through most of the Great Filter during the<br>
glacials? Just yesterday, as it were?<br>
