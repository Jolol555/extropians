<i>&gt;I would be suspicious of the temptation here. To put it crassly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we're talking about patterns of vibration within (neuronal vibratory</i><br>
<i>&gt;firing) and without (vocal chord and tympanum vibration, real as</i><br>
<i>&gt;in speech or virtual as in literature) human brains, and human</i><br>
<i>&gt;brains are intractably complex if any physical system is. And even</i><br>
<i>&gt;the above description is a drastic oversimplification. Personally,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the role played by example is far more powerful in memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution than the role played by language. This is why we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the maxim "Practice what you preach".  This is probably why someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;around here uses the Gandhi quote "You must be the change you want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to see in the world" in eir sig.</i><br>
<p>
I may have misrepresented myself here.  I have no designs to control people.<br>
I am trying to ascertain, based on what we know of memetics, to what<br>
granularity a generalized (as opposed to individually targeted, e.g.<br>
deliberate brainwashing) meme can be focused.  In other words, is it<br>
practically possible for a meme to propagate only within a very narrowly<br>
defined segment of the population?  Say for example, a meme which only<br>
propagates amongst white females, ages 34-37, who live in the Pacific<br>
Northwest.  There does seem to be instances of fine grained memetic<br>
propagation occuring.  I am interested in the factors that control<br>
susceptibility to memetic propagation.  What aspect of human cognitive<br>
function is responsible for memetic susceptibility?  Some people seem to be<br>
more susceptible than others (bandwagoneers? skeptics?).  <br>
<p>
Also, would it be possible for a person to detect a meme carefully targeted<br>
at ones self?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Would it be possible to build a piece of software that could simulate and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;predict the evolution of a meme?  Would it be possible to build a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;software that could aid in the design of complex memes?  Or a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;software that could model memes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, you'd want a very sophisticated adaptive computing system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Probably something with an Edelmanesque combination of genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;algorithms and sophisticated unsupervised-learning feedback neural</i><br>
<i>&gt;networks. For instance, your brain would make a good prototype for</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a software system. I hope this doesn't sound snide, because</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm being entirely serious. The people who are playing this game</i><br>
<i>&gt;are applying so much of their brainpower to the problem that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;develop reputations as "absent-minded professors". Sometimes they</i><br>
<i>&gt;get lost in the 24th century (is that what happened to Reilly?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;and they say stupid things like I heard Baudrillard say on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;radio a few months ago: "We must serve language." Bah!</i><br>
<p>
I don't actually plan to build software.  Building truly effective software<br>
of this nature would potentially more heinous than the invention of the<br>
nuclear bomb.  99% of the people who would interested in it would more than<br>
likely be unsavory characters at best.  And besides, historically there have<br>
always been some people who naturally possessed the capability to<br>
effectively create and propagate memes effectively anyway.<br>
<p>
I suspect that it would probably *have* to be done using some type of fuzzy,<br>
genetic algorithms because I am not so sure humans will ever have a good<br>
model of this phenomenon.  It's not just that; how do you represent<br>
something as abstract as a meme in the concrete environment of a computer in<br>
such a way that it could be useably processed?<br>
