In terms of creating smaller beings [for lack of a better word] with human<br>
intelligence, I am fairly sure that mankind would be able to control them if<br>
they were robotic [for example, as in Star Wars, okay, I know, a <br>
fictional tale, but restraining bolts are a good idea if we intend to <br>
'enslave' a human-intelligence 'species']-- or via some other means [such <br>
as in the Island of Dr. Moreau, using fear and pain as a controller]-- <br>
The human species can be quite cruel and controlling, and we would find a<br>
way to control such a 'resource'.. and if we can't, THEN we'll try and <br>
erradicate it, and of course then we have the Paget scenario! ... <br>
<p>
Just a couple cents for the pot!<br>

<i>&gt; Many years ago I read a science fiction story which went along these </i><br>
<i>&gt; lines:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dr. Paget was a mad scientist who found a way to create animals </i><br>
<i>&gt; with human intelligence.  By "human intelligence" I mean the animals </i><br>
<i>&gt; have a causal model of the world, as we do.  A Paget-dog (or padog) </i><br>
<i>&gt; can cross the street without getting run over, just like we can.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; It understands its situation, it can make plans, it can communicate </i><br>
<i>&gt; (using improvised signals and gestures) with other Paget-animals.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dr. Paget used horses, dogs, cats, rats, and mice in his experiment.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; So far all this is interesting but harmless, yes?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But then the animals escape from the lab.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The horses are quickly caught.  Horses are too big to hide and they </i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduce slowly.  They never had a chance.  But the smaller animals </i><br>
<i>&gt; disappear into the countryside.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some of the padogs and pacats are caught and killed.  The point is </i><br>
<i>&gt; not lost on the other padogs and pacats.  They know that humans are </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Enemy, and they act accordingly.  Soon there is a state of open </i><br>
<i>&gt; warfare between humans and Paget-animals (usually known simply as </i><br>
<i>&gt; "pagets").  Dr. Paget is lynched, and his son, who narrates the story, </i><br>
<i>&gt; changes his name to avoid the same fate.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A pacat who encounters a human will simply jump up into the human's </i><br>
<i>&gt; face, scratch his eyes out, and jump back to the ground before the </i><br>
<i>&gt; human can react.  Padogs run in packs and become expert at killing </i><br>
<i>&gt; humans.  Parats and pamice learn to chew the insulation off wires, thus </i><br>
<i>&gt; starting fires and making any kind of electrical equipment unusable.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cars and trucks are also unusable, because the pagets chew up the </i><br>
<i>&gt; fuel lines, v-belts, hoses, and tires.  Civilized life becomes impossible.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Humans revert to pre-industrial society.  Back to the jungle.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The pagets reproduce much faster than humans, especially after </i><br>
<i>&gt; parats discover how easy it is to kill human babies.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; After a few decades, the human population is reduced to a few million </i><br>
<i>&gt; (in the whole world!) living in a state of siege.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Dr. Paget didn't find a way to create insects or bacteria </i><br>
<i>&gt; with human intelligence.  That would be even more fun.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As I said before, I don't think it is possible to miniaturize humans.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; But if I am wrong, I don't see how the Paget-scenario can be avoided.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Small creatures (or robots) with human intelligence won't be our </i><br>
<i>&gt; slaves, at least not very long.  Assuming they really do have human </i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence, they will soon find a way to escape (perhaps with help </i><br>
<i>&gt; from sympathetic humans, or humans with more schadenfreude than </i><br>
<i>&gt; sense).  Then we will try to hunt them down, and war will ensue.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; How else could it turn out?  </i><br>
