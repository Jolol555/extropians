                           <br>
<p>
No I don't, I doubt if anybody has precise enough knowledge to make such a  <br>
curve. My statement that the early earth must of been hot was based on the <br>
following. The Earth was formed by a very large cloud of particles, this <br>
cloud must have possessed a lot of potential gravitational energy. When the  <br>
Earth coalesced this potential energy was gone and was replaced by heat <br>
energy, a LOT of heat energy, enough that if converted to kinetic energy <br>
could push every atom in the planet away from the center at the escape <br>
velocity of 7  miles a second. A secondary source of heat would come from <br>
radioactive isotopes that the earth must have possessed in much higher  <br>
abundance 4.6 billion years ago than today. Radioactive potassium would have <br>
given off the most heat, followed by uranium. Harold Urey calculated that the<br>
radioactivity alone was enough to heat the center of the Earth ( admittedly <br>
not the surface) to 1500 degrees C. The center of the Earth is thought to be <br>
at about 5500 degrees C, the rest of the heat came from the kinetic energy of <br>
in-falling matter.<br>
<p>
The fact that not a single rock survives from Earth's first 800 million years <br>
indicates that conditions must have been very violent indeed, but it also <br>
destroys the evidence about exactly  how hot it was.   <br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;bacteria are lots hardier than Dinos.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, but are bacteria hardier than rocks, especially the very earliest <br>
bacteria? Also, these bacteria must do more than just survive, they must <br>
evolve from simple chemicals.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;My sources are pretty authoritive (see paper cites), and                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;clearly say that Eukaryotic cells appeared about 1.8-2.0 bya                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;(billion years ago), when the atmosphere became oxygen               </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;-dominated after all the ocean's iron was finally oxidized.  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Looking through my home library I can find 3 books to support my 1.2 to 1.4 <br>
bya  claim for the first Eukaryotic cells, "Life Itself" by Francis Crick, <br>
"Origins" by Robert Shapiro (no, not OJ's lawyer), and "Darwin to DNA" by <br>
G Ledyard Stebbins, I found another book "The Rise of Life" by John Reader <br>
that said 1.45 bya. As I mentioned, I do remember reading about a claim for a <br>
later figure, but for the life of me I can't remember where. I suspect that <br>
when you look at tiny fossils that are billions of years old, it's not always <br>
easy to tell if they're Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes.<br>
                    <br>
I agree with your timeline about the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, <br>
but I see no reason why only Eukaryotes could have caused it.<br>
