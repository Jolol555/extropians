<i>&gt;Design problem #1.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Suppose you want to build a cell that acts as a refrigerator.  The </i><br>
cell <br>
<i>&gt;contains a vacuole within which the temperature can be reduced to a </i><br>
<i>&gt;point near absolute zero.  How could this be done?  What mechanism </i><br>
<i>&gt;could the cell use to pump heat out of a small region?  We assume that </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the cell has a source of energy, and that its surroundings can serve </i><br>
as <br>
<i>&gt;a heat sink.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lyle </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Remember that the inner cell walls will accept radiative <br>
energy as (T2-T1)^4. The skin depth, or rather 1/e penetration<br>
depth, for thermal photons<br>
is on the order of a few hundred nanometers. This may<br>
set lower bounds on the size of the cell.<br>
