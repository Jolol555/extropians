I'll leave the answer to this one up to others.<br>

<p>
Why is this "domination" (= great success in the market) to everyone's<br>
detriment. I don't agree. I think there's currently a good mix of very tough<br>
competition and standard setting enabled by the Microsoft-Intel alliance on<br>
one side, and the Apple-Motorola alliance on the other. It's unfortunate<br>
that the folks at Apple weren't better business people, as I'd like to keep<br>
the pressure on Microsoft. Fortunately the opening of the Net has created a<br>
huge area that's keeping the competitive pressure on Microsoft.<br>
<p>
It's interesting to note that Microsoft just announcing that they are<br>
opening the standard for ActiveX. They want to create an independent group<br>
to set standards and accessibility. The competition from Netscape, Sun and<br>
others led them to this move that will be wonderfully preventive of monopoly<br>
problems. If Microsoft really can do what they want without caring about the<br>
market, they would't bother with this unusual and encouraging move.<br>
<p>
Do you really think the software market would function better if the<br>
government decided what products could be made, by whom, and how much they<br>
could be sold for? (After a few years in the govt. agency's committees...)<br>
