Eric Lerner explains, in his 1992 book "The Big Bang Never Happened" <br>
(Vintage Books / Random House), how the Big Bang theory is an irrational <br>
faith, "a scientific version of the Biblical story of Creation." And therein <br>
lies a story worth posting for Extropians.<br>
<p>
Lerner sums up his theme as follows: "Today Big Bang theorists see a <br>
universe much like that envisioned by the medieval scholars - a finite <br>
cosmos created ex nihilo, from nothing, whose perfection is in the past, <br>
which is degenerating to a final end. The perfect principles used to form <br>
this universe can only be known by pure reason, guided by authority, <br>
independent of observation. Such a cosmic myth arises in periods of social <br>
crisis or retreat, and reinforces the separation of thought and action, <br>
ruler and ruled. It breeds fatalistic pessimism that paralyzes society. By <br>
contrast, the opposing view, plasma cosmology, is empirical ... Its <br>
proponents see an infinite universe evolving over infinite time. The <br>
universe can be studied only by observation - there is no final answer in <br>
science and no final authority. This approach, binding together thought and <br>
action, theory and observation, has proved, over the ages, to be a weapon of <br>
social change. The idea of progress in the universe has always been linked <br>
with the idea of social progress on earth."<br>
<p>
Lerner shows how the basic assumptions of the Big Bang theory have been <br>
refuted by observation; yet, to explain the discrepancies, its theorists <br>
continue to postulate elaborate, contrived explanations, such as cosmic <br>
strings and dark matter, involving conveniently unobservable phenomena. This <br>
is quite similar to the way statists keep coming up with more government <br>
fixes for the new problems continuously arising from previous government <br>
attempts to fix something. Lerner points out: "The deductive method's <br>
disregard for observation and practical application of science originated <br>
with the slave master's disdain for manual work, while the empirical <br>
method's system is based on free craftsmen and traders combining theory and <br>
observation."<br>
<p>
Toward the end of part 1, 'The Cosmological Debate' in "The Big Bang Never <br>
Happened", Lerner describes the long struggle of Swedish Nobel prize winner <br>
Hannes Alfven who pioneered the principles of plasma cosmology; then Lerner <br>
explains how he himself developed his theories about the speed of plasmas in <br>
vortices, all confirmed by astronomical observations; and how along with <br>
their collaborator Tony Perat at Los Alamos, they finally achieved some <br>
public recognition in 1989 after the first joint conference of plasma <br>
physicists and astrophysicists.<br>
<p>
Note that most popular science books about cosmology and the nature of the <br>
universe in the past few years have all been written by mathematical <br>
physicists, like Paul Davies' "The Mind Of God" and Roger Penrose's two <br>
best-sellers, both of whom long for a world of pure reason, of mathematical <br>
ideals, and a theory of everything.<br>
<p>
On the fictional side, most of the stories in 1995's "Far Futures" <br>
anthology, edited by Gregory Benford, take this pessimistic view of the 'end <br>
of time', which might be dedicated to Frank Tipler's "Physics of <br>
Immortality" ideas. The notable exception is Poul Anderson's "Genesis", <br>
about the independent, extropian, solar intelligences of a gallactic <br>
MetaMind. Anderson's story really constrasts with Charles Sheffield's "At <br>
the Eschaton" about a 'hero' who conquers the galaxy and then takes over the <br>
Omega Point and even destroys this universe all so he can resurrect his <br>
beloved in a new 'baby' universe of his own creation.<br>
<p>
Back in "The Big Bang Never Happened", in ch.7 'The Endless Flow of Time', <br>
Lerner promotes Ilya Prigogine's theories of order from chaos, and how the <br>
mathematical physicist's notion of the reversibility of time is an <br>
inapplicable abstraction. More importantly, he shows how evolution is a <br>
process of more efficient energy capture, and applies to ecosystems, if not <br>
to individual organisms: "the debris of one stage fuels a subsequent stage <br>
... Thus there is no inherent limit to evolution away from equilibrium, even <br>
with a fixed supply of energy, so long as a process can continually increase <br>
the efficiency with which it recycles the energy."<br>
<p>
Lerner then goes on to castigate Bohr &amp; Heisenberg's mysticism, moral <br>
neutrality, and Nazi collaboration, particularly what he calls Heisenberg's <br>
fascist search for 'The Central Order'. I might call this the desire to <br>
crack the 'privileged' levels of the universe's operating system (as opposed <br>
to agoric transformations at the application level).<br>
<p>
Lerner goes on to offer some clues regarding vortexs from thermodynamics &amp; <br>
hydrodynamics that might eventually reconcile the inconsistencies of quantum <br>
theory &amp; relativity. I interpret his discussion here as saying that only <br>
waves have any existence over time, particles &amp; objects are merely the <br>
current, fleeting froth of interacting waves - the epiphenomena. The popular <br>
paradigm, however, tends to think of objects &amp; material things as reality, <br>
while the messages that pass between them are considered fleeting &amp; <br>
insubstantial.<br>
<p>
In ch.9, 'Infinite in Time and Space', Lerner describes how "the Big Bang is <br>
entangled with religious and theological ideas," and it's only a short step <br>
from theological longings for a Necessary Being (God), a Creator from <br>
outside, to science as an elite priesthood, and the fascist search for a <br>
Central Order to the universe.<br>
<p>
In particular he discusses how particle physics and the Big Bang cosmology <br>
have an incestuous relationship (as well as circular logic) - their embrace <br>
of purely deductive reasoning from subjective ideals while ignoring <br>
observation and inductive reasoning. Lerner nicely sums up what is wrong <br>
with the purely deductive approach taken by the mathematical physicists <br>
(with their Platonic ideals) who have dominated much of popular science in <br>
recent years: "it is futile to try to derive natural laws from aesthetic <br>
ideas."<br>
<p>
Finally, Lerner makes the most important point of the book: "By positing an <br>
end to all things, conventional cosmology necessarily implies one of two <br>
philosophical stances: either a blind existential pessimism, humanity <br>
condemned to a meaningless existence, or a dualistic faith like that of the <br>
Middle Ages, which finds meaning only in the world beyond."<br>
<p>
Lerner goes on to describe the theories of Teilhard de Chardin who, he says, <br>
"rejects the dualism that assumes two distinct existences, that of the <br>
spirit and that of matter." Furthermore, according to Lerner, "[Teilhard] <br>
hypothesizes that there are two forms of energy. One, the 'tangential,' <br>
links an entity with existing processes in the universe; the other, <br>
'radial,' is identified with the creation of new relations and higher orders <br>
of complexity. This second form of energy Teilhard de Chardin identifies <br>
with consciousness." A bandwidth-optimizing summary of this is Francois <br>
Jacob's 1974 quote on how energy &amp; information are "the two forms of power; <br>
the power to do and the power to direct what is done," noted in John <br>
Holland's "Hidden Order".<br>
<p>
In ch.9, Lerner's section on 'Infinity &amp; the Deity' makes the following <br>
major point: "On the one hand are those who ... believe that an infinite <br>
universe will challenge the authority of the deity. On the other, their <br>
opponents believe only a universe without limits befits an infinite God."<br>
<p>
Lerner's final chapter, 'Cosmos and Society' is extremely disappointing <br>
because (I think) Lerner misinterprets economics as badly as he accuses <br>
mathematical physicists of misinterpreting cosmology, and for the same <br>
reason - Lerner has no hands-on experience with economics or industry, he <br>
starts with preconcieved socialistic ideals and then searches for statistics <br>
to fit his thesis, namely, that capitalism is in decline and a new mode of <br>
'worker democracy' is needed. He fails to distinguish between the <br>
pseudo-market, mercantilist economies of Europe &amp; South America and the <br>
truly free-market, though regulation-stifled, economies of the U.S. and the <br>
Asian 'Tigers'. Furthermore, (as anyone who hasn't had their head burried in <br>
plasma physics would know) he totally fails to recognize that the current <br>
'slowdown' in progress is due to a major shift from a labor-based, <br>
manufacturing economy to an information-based, service economy, and is <br>
certainly not due to any crisis in capitalism, which has yet to be really <br>
tried in perhaps 90% of the world's countries!<br>
<p>
The other point where Lerner's thinking is seriously flawed is his <br>
contention (in ch.7) that "a universe as computer, a finitely divisable <br>
universe, would indeed have no future and no past ... because its every <br>
action is precisely predictable."<br>
<p>
I don't believe this. Digital computers are able to perform simulations that <br>
exhibit instabilities where the results will be unpredictable. Rudy Rucker <br>
commented on this notion in his book "Mind Tools" (p116): "One feels that, <br>
although some of the world's information is digital, much of it is also <br>
analog.... It could be, though, that we simply aren't able to examine the <br>
world closely enough to see its digital texture. Something feels analog to <br>
us if its pixels are too small for us to readily sense them.... Nevertheless <br>
 - and this point is worth stressing - any physical process can be modeled to <br>
any desired degree of precision by a complicated-enough digital <br>
computation." But, can a digital program exhibit the kind of non-local <br>
effects that Lerner proposes? I say yes - All systems are digital at the <br>
bottom but become wave-like, or analog (analogue?), only when they interact <br>
as independent (agoric) entities. (By the way, could someone please point me <br>
to the origin of the term 'agoric'?)<br>
<p>
My notion is that a pluralistic universe must be object-oriented at the <br>
bottom (what I call the Content level). That is, it must be composed of <br>
discrete (though interdependent) entities. It cannot be continuous or analog <br>
like Eric Lerner claims, otherwise, there is no chance for the decision <br>
points that allow free will. In other words, the base level of reality must <br>
be composed of particles, not waves. These 'low-level', object-oriented <br>
systems, or 'particles', however, merely process transactions according to <br>
subjective or internal (intrinsic) criteria. The next step up (at what I <br>
call the Context level), the system becomes event-driven and interactive <br>
(extrinsic), correlating its internal states with external information. <br>
Finally, at the Contest level, the system becomes wave-like and abstract <br>
functions are enabled by applying knowledge achieved at (what I call) the <br>
Contest level to produce novelty back at the Content level through self <br>
transformation.<br>
<p>
And so, Boundless Expansion (NOT Big Bang), Self Transformation ('free will' <br>
/ libertarianism), Dynamic Optimism (unbounded universe), Intelligent <br>
Technology (3-tiered, Content/Context/Contest systems design), Spontaneous <br>
Order (bionomic + fractal + selectional algorithms) may all be 'proven' from <br>
the 'hidden order' of ecology, thermodynamics &amp; hydrodynamics.<br>
<p>
P.S. Too bad I'm not a physicist or mathematician. My .gov address is the <br>
only one I have access to and the opinions expressed here are NOT those of <br>
the agency I work for (Bureau of Labor Statistics). I'm just a hired hand <br>
who enjoys hacking (not cracking) the economic stats (hormones) of MetaMan <br>
for a living. (I have worked as a systems analyst under contracts to the <br>
federal government for 10 years, but NEVER for a regulatory agency.)<br>
