Last night I thought of a phrase which struck me as being very Extropian.<br>
<p>
"Question Tradition"<br>
<p>
I think that's a lot of what we're doing, as Extropians.  We are questioning <br>
tradition.  We question the tradition of death, we question the tradition of <br>
coercion, we question the tradition of ignorance and servility, we question <br>
the traditional belief systems and paradigms, we question the tradition of <br>
blind obedience to Authority, and we question all other entropic traditions.  <br>
When we question these traditions, we find much about them that is <br>
incompatible with our extropic goals.<br>
<p>
As Extropians, we prefer to find new, more effective ways to accomplish our <br>
goals, rather than clinging to traditional ways of doing things which don't <br>
work well enough.<br>
