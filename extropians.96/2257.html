I think Rich is quite correct;  property "rights" are fictitious.  They are <br>
simply some of the protocols that many humans have agreed to interact with <br>
each other under.  I happen to like the Property Protocol.  I enjoy acquiring <br>
things and creating things, and I enjoy the fact that most people do not take <br>
"my" things away from me.  I think a lot of people enjoy "owning" things, and <br>
out of mutual respect and mutual benefit, they have agreed to respect each <br>
other's desires of "ownership" and forcefully prevent others from taking <br>
another's "property".<br>
<p>
It's a sort of conspiracy.  It's sort of a game.  It's a lot of people <br>
agreeing to behave a certain way and act according to certain rules.  It seems <br>
to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved in the agreement.  Whether <br>
this game is morally "right" or "wrong" is a subject of debate.  <br>
