I often have that feeling and have to think the answer is, "we're already in<br>
that world: AND "we'll never be in that world".  Living in the Bible Belt of<br>
the U.S. I am *constantly* surrounded by an all-pervasive religiousity: Every<br>
street corner seems to have some huge church edifice on it, fundamentalist<br>
christian bumper stickers festoon every other car and people's speech is full<br>
of references to god and religion.  I'm often struck by the *huge* gulf<br>
between the ideas I share with a small circle of close friends and this net<br>
community on the one hand and the overwhelming mass of people I encounter<br>
every day on the other.  In many ways, even more disturbing is the apparent<br>
religious conviction of most "educated" people I encounter: Despite lots of<br>
"formal education", the ideas of the Enlightenment don't seem to have had<br>
more than the most superficial impact on the world view of most people.  I<br>
think to myself: "What if just one-quarter of what is spent on religion were<br>
spent on furthering the transhumanist agenda?  Just think of the progress we<br>
would make!"  It is frustrating and can be depressing.<br>
<p>
The only way I can "reconcile" this is to be thankful that there is a cadre<br>
of folks -- however small in relative terms -- who have internalized the<br>
humanism of the Enlightenment and are pushing those ideas further.  It seems<br>
that what will come is more of the same, i.e. that the "vanguard" will<br>
continue to advance at an ever-accelerating pace, pulling at least some of<br>
the rest of humanity behind it as matter of simple "social fluid dynamics" --<br>
at least for a while longer.  If the rate of advance of the vanguard passes a<br>
certain point (like the sound barrier?), their social sphere will completely<br>
separate from the rest of humanity.  What happens after that could get very<br>
weird, indeed ...<br>
