<p>
If they were programmed to evolve in an open ended system, there need <br>
would be to exist.  Furthering this need, they would probably need to <br>
reproduce/grow and mutate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would it have needs? - or more precisely would they precieve the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; needs as we do, not being subject to the fight or flight domain we have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; negotiate?</i><br>
<p>
They may very well be subject to the fight or flight reactions <br>
similar to ours.  Watching an AI grow will give us a huge insight <br>
into the possible paths evolution can take.  They may even develop<br>
emotions, if these are beneficial to their survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We need food,nurturing,clothing,shelter,etc.. What AI conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; correspond to that?</i><br>
<p>
Food - Disk space, memory space.<br>
Clothing - who needs it ?<br>
shelter - firewalls, security systems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we (thru mimicry of intelligence as we know it)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  create them as similar to primate intelligence, then (?) reproduction</i><br>
<i>&gt; /expansion-  but if NN intelligences program themselves, how could we predict</i><br>

<i>&gt; we assume they would inherently take our values and expand or pervert them -</i><br>
<i>&gt; an allegiance to their "creators"? Some how I don't see that, as inviting as</i><br>
<i>&gt; it sounds.</i><br>
<p>
The best option is to have as little control possible over their <br>
evolution.  It would be a mistake to use homo-centric thinking and <br>
try and force them to adopt our evolutionary path. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if they could "use" us for manual labor- and what would we produce for</i><br>
<i>&gt; them?</i><br>
<p>
Entertainment ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In essence, what would they want to destroy us *for*?  </i><br>
Comparatively &gt; aesthetic messiness? <br>
<p>
They would only destroy us if we threaten their survival by <br>
inhibiting their growth/reproduction.  <br>
