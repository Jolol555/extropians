IAN: So does virtually every toxic agent. Physical evidence most <br>
strongly suggests, to say the least, that the Davidians got doses <br>
well over safe levels. As the Amnesty International study I cited <br>
confirmed, over 40 people were known to have died from just CS and <br>
CN gas exposure, in cases before Waco where these compounds did <br>
not even burn. The FBI's heavy gun-fire into the center as the <br>
fire started, also tends to suggest that many received fatal <br>
doses of bullets.<br>
<p>
And consider that since the FBI had cut-off the electricity, the <br>
Davidians where using fuel lamps for both heating and lighting. They <br>
also had all the windows covered with thick blankets to hide from FBI <br>
snipers,  thus they had to have lit fuel sources for light all day long,  <br>
and the FBI was well aware of this. Nevertheless, they began pumping in <br>
flammable agents -- which when burned, release lethal agents -- and at <br>
the same time began knocking over the house. It doesn't take a rocket <br>
scientist to see the imminent catastrophe being manufactured here. <br>
<p>
Clearly, the FBI's actions were at the very least, negligible homicide. <br>
Instead, it's billed by the GovtMedia -- and thus encoded into the <br>
public mind -- as at worst just another govt snafu, and at best <br>
a valiant effort to save the lives of crazed suicidal maniacs.<br>
<p>
It's important for Extropians to have and remember the information <br>
of what happened in Waco because it is an example of how the govt <br>
has, can, and will use force and disinformation to snuff-out <br>
alternative communities, which Extropians may one day create.<br>
