Hi people<br>
<p>
Just a few short, quick ripostes to John Clark's illuminating response:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;Damien quoting Drexler: `If a car were assembled from</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;normal-sized robots from a thousand pieces</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I re-read that passage in Drexler's popular book, it seems to me that he was </i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to demonstrate to the general reader how small an atom was  and how </i><br>
<i>&gt;many it would take to build a car, about 10^30. [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On page 60 of "Engines of Creation" he talks about building (growing?) a </i><br>
<i>&gt;rocket engine in one step using general purpose assemblers. [much more snip]</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but look at all the other stuff in that section (pp. 55-62).<br>
Drexler starts by making a comparison (the basis, I believe, of his<br>
continuing analogy) with a primitive bulk assembler that makes<br>
prefabricated chips and sticks them together, etc.  <br>
<p>
A sheet nano assembler arm (p. 59) cements 10^6 atoms a second.  Wow!  But:<br>
`making a meter thick slab will take over a year'.  And going quicker makes<br>
everything get hot fast.  So: prefab at leisure and stockpile.  `Molecular<br>
assemblers will team up with larger assemblers to build big things quickly'.<br>
This fits in with my version of the hierarchical method for nano-making a<br>
car.  His spaceship engine, admittedly, takes less than a day, but I gather<br>
that the fabricator uses stockpiled carbon fiber and sapphired aluminium<br>
oxide.   (And yes,  probably what Drexler was doing in that cited passage is<br>
to educate those who can't instantly grasp the order-of-magnitude gap<br>
between atoms and cars.  I'm one of them.)  <br>
<p>
What interests me is the number of gestures at programming, instruction, etc<br>
in these pages.  There's the `seed' you mention, a nice device but chockful<br>
of knowledge that has been put there by prodigious human effort, I gather.<br>
Yes, maybe some of what it sketches is data gathered by `disassemblers', but<br>
as you point out this data has to be shrunk by compression routines.  (At<br>
this point I admit what must be obvious, that I don't know what I'm talking<br>
about: maybe this can be turned over to a no-brain number cruncher.  But<br>
maybe it can't.)  <br>
<p>
Here's a citation I think might be salutary, from Kevin Kelly, not known for<br>
his techno-terror, in his<br>
<p>
Out of Control: The New Biology of machines, London: Fourth Estate, 1994:<br>
<p>
`...turn on a switch, and a linear system awakens.  It's ready to serve you.<br>
If it stalls, restart it...  But complex swarm systems with rich hierarchies<br>
take time to boot up.  The more complex, the longer it takes to warm up.<br>
Each hierarchical level has to settle down; lateral causes have to slosh<br>
around and come to rest; a million autonomous agents have to acquaint<br>
themselves.  I think this will be the hardest lesson for humans to learn:<br>
that organic complexity will entail organic time.'  (p. 24)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;That [DNA] sketchy information gets unpacked via (1) a</i><br>
rich                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;information-dense  environment </i><br>
                 <br>
<i>&gt;But that's no different than Nanotechnology because software is always </i><br>
<i>&gt;useless without a computer to run it on.</i><br>
<p>
And what I meant wasn't that simple.  I'm thinking of the kind of elaborate<br>
and unpredictable informational richness of the environment that goes into<br>
unpacking a genome, which Jacques Monod spoke of a third of a century ago in<br>
CHANCE AND NECESSITY.  This info density is available to nano engineers as<br>
well, of course, but it's been explored and exploited by living thangs via a<br>
truly Vast culled-random-walk.  Despise bio-evolution if you will, there's<br>
something to be said for letting Vast numbers (Dennett-speak) of variants do<br>
the walking through design space...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;How many atoms was that again? How much memory do you have</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;in your hard drive?           </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In section 12.7 of Nanosystems Drexler shows how to store 10^25 bits per cubic </i><br>
<i>&gt;meter in fast RAM, or 10^28 bits in a slower (but still fast by our standards) </i><br>
<i>&gt;"tape" storage. It should also be noted that the arm on a Nanotechnology </i><br>
<i>&gt;based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a human arm, and that </i><br>
<i>&gt;means it could move back and forth 50 million times faster than a human arm</i><br>
<p>
Is this consistent with the EofC quote above?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;The link from impossibly complex algorithms generated by</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;such means, </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If such algorithms exist then they are not impossible.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, my rhetorical skid: *hideously* complex?  *dauntingly* complex?<br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;nano fabrication, will very quickly escape our understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;If by "our" you mean 3 pound brains made of meat then I agree, but again, you  </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't need to understand why something works to manufacture it. </i><br>
<p>
No, you don't, but if it's likely to goo you it's nice to have a clue. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides, I don't think 3 pounds of meat will be the smartest thing around</i><br>
forever.<br>
<p>
Again, there's this tendency to slide from `we won't always be top kid on<br>
the block' to `&gt;AI is just around the corner'.  Maybe it is, but I think<br>
rudimentary nanofab might be sooner.  On the other hand, one thing I've<br>
learned through 33 years of earning my living as a science fiction writer<br>
(learned in principle, at any rate; it's horribly hard to put into practice)<br>
is the monstrously interconnected complexity of change, which makes novelty<br>
easier and faster (nano *and* AI will emerge at the same time, yes, and<br>
boot-strap each other).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you made up a list that contained the type and position of every atom in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;car this list would contain a HUGE amount of redundancy.  [Just use] the same </i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of algorithms we use today for data compression in ZIP  </i><br>
<i>&gt;and GIF files.</i><br>
<p>
Easily said.  But does this work with something of the order of 10^30 atoms,<br>
*each scanned individually*?  (Might be easier after all to build from<br>
scratch: `put an iron atom next to this iron atom.  Do 10^15 times, then<br>
turn right'.  Hmm.  Big heavy pots are easy, steaks might be tricky to program.)<br>
<p>
As I say, just some stray thoughts.  Are we going around in circles here?<br>
(I hope not.)<br>
<p>
Best, Damien Broderick<br>
