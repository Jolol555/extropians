As far as i'm concerned thats not the only problem there is in the privacy<br>
issue.<br>
<p>
Privacy is something very personal. I think the biggest problem with having<br>
cameras everywhere would be with the most immideate family. How would you<br>
like your wife, mother, mother in-law, lover, mistress... to be able to se<br>
how you behaved at the last party you where at. Did you dance a little to<br>
close to someone, did you talk about things a little to personal. Did you<br>
perhaps even kiss someone in drunken happines?<br>
<p>
The party setup is just one example.<br>
<p>
But these are things that are not big issues on a national basis. But in<br>
your private life they can have major implications. They could make it<br>
impossible to live a normal life, if everybody could watch everybody<br>
anytime..<br>
