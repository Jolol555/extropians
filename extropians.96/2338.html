Chris Hind (prospective recruit #96-0413) said, "For some reason I get this <br>
creepy vision of some bizarre occult group when I try to envision an extropian <br>
gathering".<br>
<p>
There is a very good reason why you feel this way.  You are starting to <br>
understand our plan for you.  Part of you is a little nervous about this.  <br>
Give it time, Chris, and you will lose all your apprehension and possibly <br>
become a member of our inner circle.  We see great potential in you.<br>
<p>
We have been watching you, Chris, for a while now, and we have been working <br>
dilligently to convert your mind more fully to our way of thinking.  We've <br>
been tracking your Internet activities and creating web pages that you would <br>
likely be attracted to.  We set up several possible mailing lists, and you <br>
happened to join this one.  Most of the posters to this list are Insiders, <br>
Chris, working on converting you more deeply to our ways.<br>
<p>
Our conversations have been carefully designed to pull your mind more and more <br>
deeply into our way of thinking.  By your posts here and elsewhere, we members <br>
of the inner circle have realized how deeply you've been converted.  To resist <br>
is futile; you already think like US.  You only have a little further to go.  <br>
Even this revelation of our plan will not shake you from the path you are on <br>
to becoming one of US.  <br>
<p>
You believe so deeply in the illusion that we have presented to you that you <br>
will almost certainly think I am joking with you.  But I assure you I am not.  <br>
It's time for you to move to the next, deeper level of committment.  You will <br>
know when you are ready, and so will we.<br>
<p>
