<i>&gt;IMO Extropians are usually willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;discuss any creative, productive , futurist topic as long as it is possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have a rational conversation about it and learn or share</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge</i><br>
<p>
Is it not rational?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think more disciplined cohesive topics, rather than diversifying.</i><br>
<p>
Order rises from chaos through typical evolutionary spontaneous orders. Why<br>
walk on previously tread soil? Wouldn't it be much better to be on the<br>
cutting edge? This in itself is considered the cutting edge by many but i<br>
desire to proceed as far into the cutting edge as possible!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe,Chris you should listen more and learn all</i><br>
<i>&gt;you can 'bout these topics before you criticize,mmmm?....</i><br>
<p>
Oh come on! Like I don't know the concept of AI, nano, or uploading? and<br>
besides I'm not criticizing, I'm merely making an observation. It appears to<br>
me as though there MUST be literally *THOUSANDS* of other equally useful<br>
technologies out there possibly even beyond the big three. These topics may<br>
be where the next steps lie in our continued evolution beyond posthuman. Do<br>
we actually think we will me nothing more than a brain that gets larger and<br>
larger soaking up knowledge forever? In my opinion NO, there will be some<br>
breakthough discovery that will dramatically change the whole playing field.<br>
We see how technologies and ideas rise up and get squashed and replaced by<br>
others such as how first came the dream of the 500 TV channels which was<br>
squashed by then Interactive Television which later was squashed by the<br>
internet. I strongly believe that we will reach the equivelant of nano or<br>
probably even better BEFORE your present predictions. Following my concept,<br>
nano as it gets closer will get squashed by something else which will equal<br>
or likely surpass it which we HAVEN'T EVEN DREAMED OF YET! This is what I am<br>
aiming for! To find out what that tech will be!<br>
