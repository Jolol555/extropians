The concepts of the being that was to be Uriel crystallised into<br>
a rugged, slightly bitter complex: [Why did you call this<br>
meeting?][Is there a perception of need?][Why so little<br>
preparatory information?]<br>
<p>
Michael agreed with an curlicue: &lt;Yes, why Gabriel? It isn't like<br>
you calling a high-level meeting with us without informing us<br>
beforehand&gt;<br>
<p>
Gabriel sent out a yellow-smooth streamer of explanation-apology:<br>
{We appreciate that without prior problem-understanding<br>
communication becomes much harder for us, but in this case we<br>
have a need for views that span the space of problem spaces, not<br>
just the problem space at hand}<br>
<p>
[A meta-level meeting?][Determining what problems to<br>
solve?][Setting a course?]<br>
<p>
{Yes}{A course at least in some vision-space}<br>
<p>
<i>| This has to do with your long range simulations | Raphael's</i><br>
complex was simple and coldly clear, a statement of fact. <br>
<p>
{Yes again, clear-sighted one}{Obviously there was little need to<br>
give information beforehand since it could be deduced so simply}<br>
<p>
[Enough][Metadiscussions are unseemly at a metalevel meeting]<br>
<p>
{I have simulated the future growth and evolution of the<br>
technosphere}{Many complex concepts have emerged from the<br>
simulations, including some predictors}{The directions of future<br>
change are disturbing}<br>
<p>
Gabriel manifested an immense complex, highlighting various<br>
substructures. At the core was the four-dimensional cone of the<br>
technosphere, the sphere of self-sustaining<br>
exploration/colonisation/integration expanding in all directions<br>
from the solar system close to lightspeed. Most of it was just<br>
extrapolation, but near the apex-origin reality greens<br>
demonstrated the known state. Inside the cone subtle patterns<br>
played, manydimensional evolution models and decision manifolds.<br>
The explanations unfolded their hidden structures into<br>
experienced reality. <br>
<p>
{Obviously the entities and cultures that are spreading will<br>
change over time, and spread their memetic progeny further<br>
outwards, crating this wedge-pattern.}{Each wedge a different<br>
direction, physically and mentally}{Communications mix up the<br>
cultures, but near the edge the spread is faster, so divergence<br>
will continue}<br>
<p>
&lt;That is obvious&gt;<br>
<p>
{This includes meta-evolution}{The rules are changing at the<br>
frontier, becoming ever more aggressive and efficient}{New<br>
metalevels will emerge in the zone just inside the frontier, and<br>
spread backwards causing recolonisation}<br>
<p>
Ultraviolet hypercones sprouted on the edge and began to fill the<br>
large hypercone like growing crystals, inexorably moving inwards<br>
and towards each other. <br>
<p>
[That is preposterous][Unlikely due to present colonisation][The<br>
frontier and zone metalevels are optimised for growth, not<br>
infiltration]<br>
<p>
<i>| Metaevolutionary rules always outcompete evolutionary rules in</i><br>
the long run || And when a metasystem using them becomes able to<br>
infiltrate the coreward technosphere, it will spread inwards |<br>
<p>
{Exactly}{A back-reaction will inevitably result where a new<br>
order spreads}{It is unlikely the new metasystems will be able to<br>
accommodate structures like us}<br>
<p>
&lt;What is the self-effect of this simulation?&gt;&lt;Other clusters will<br>
have done the same thing or will do it&gt;<br>
<p>
[It doesn't matter at all][The frontier is moving outwards faster<br>
than any recall memes]<br>
<p>
{Counteragents cannot be developed since the possible threats<br>
will move inwards at lightspeed}{You cannot defeat a foe you<br>
cannot know}{When you know a metaevolutionary foe it will have<br>
defeated you}<br>
<p>
<i>| You are implicating that we should seek to speed up or cause</i><br>
metaevolution here at the core |<br>
<p>
{Always predicting my rhetoric}{True}{We need to out-evolve<br>
evolution before the metaevolution cones reach us}<br>
<p>
An infrared cone blossomed from the centre of the cone, spreading<br>
outwards. In some scenarios it ignored the ultraviolet cones and<br>
just spread through them, erasing their existence. In others they<br>
clashed, creating turbulent boundaries of mixing. In some it<br>
failed completely. <br>
<p>
[The processing requirements are too large][The frontier is<br>
growing quadratically, while we only have access to a constant<br>
amount of matter/energy/information]<br>
<p>
{The problem is equivalent to transcending a chain of systems<br>
along an optimal path}{It is undecidable}<br>
<p>
&lt;That suggests the need for an orthogonal creative solution&gt;<br>
<p>
[One possibility would be to create a physical or computational<br>
barrier for spreading memes or other structures around the<br>
core][Such a barrier would not stop the recolonisation for long<br>
though, since the systems on the outside would have plenty of<br>
computational power to analyse it]<br>
<p>
<i>| What about making a lightspeed-expanding barrier || Such a barrier</i><br>
cannot be analysed |<br>
<p>
&lt;Neat&gt;&lt;But how could such a barrier, or rather physical change be<br>
made to propagate?&gt;<br>
<p>
{Vacuum decay}{Since the vacuum state is only metastable, it<br>
could theoretically be made to decay to a lower state}{A release<br>
of very large quantities of energy}{The decay at one point would<br>
cause the vacuum at nearby points to decay, creating a spreading<br>
chain reaction}{Soon the decay would be spreading outwards at<br>
lightspeed}<br>
<p>
A black cone spread from the core, surrounded by a brilliant wave<br>
of light. All other patterns disappeared into its darkness,<br>
eradicated by the quantum storm. <br>
<p>
[Sounds exactly like what is needed][Since the metalevels will be<br>
focused on recolonisation by definition, they will not be<br>
prepared for a decay event][But how to achieve it?]<br>
<p>
&lt;That requires more research&gt;&lt;We also need to study how to<br>
translate our structure into post-decay particle states&gt;&lt;Hard<br>
problems, but in principle solvable&gt;<br>
<p>
{There is another complication}{Given my models of the<br>
technosphere, other clusters will also come to similar solutions}<br>
<p>
In the model, several dark cones began to blossom around the core<br>
at roughly the same time. <br>
<p>
{We do not know if the new vacuum states are compatible with each<br>
other}{It is possible that the decay always ends up at the same<br>
ground state}{It is possible that the decay results in different<br>
states}{This is a competition situation}<br>
<p>
[Obviously we have to work fast][Faster than the recolonisation<br>
waves][Faster than the other clusters][We need to cause a vacuum<br>
decay first]<br>
<p>
