[[Michael Lorrey posts:]]<br>
<p>
Every day I still wonder that<br>
no one has developed this before, <br>
<p>
[[I came up with something very much like the “Lorrey Drive” when I was<br>
about nine years old. I found out several years later, much to my <br>
chagrin, that<br>
a) Lots of other people have had the same idea, and<br>
b) it does not work.]]<br>
<p>
it is such a simple concept, but I guess<br>
that most people still interpret Newtonian Mechanics according to <br>
classical<br>
human perceptions. The idea that reaction mass can have its momentum <br>
drawn<br>
out of it and then recycling it is so contrary ...,<br>
that it just seems to violate some natural law or something. <br>
<p>
[[Yes, this is the problem.<br>
The two laws in question are:<br>
a) Conservation of Linear Momentum<br>
b) Conservation of Angular Momentum<br>
<p>
Outside of transitory, self-canceling  quantum effects, there<br>
 is zero (0) experimental evidence of a violation of either of <br>
these “Laws”, which is why they are called such.<br>
They are therefore used in the design of everything from Autogyros<br>
to Z-0 detectors, with fantastic success.]]<br>
<p>
What I have developed has been<br>
attempted by others, although theirs were half baked designs, because <br>
they<br>
really did not understand the mechanism fully. The Lorrey drive is a <br>
device<br>
which converts angular momentum (torque) to linear acceleration <br>
(thrust)<br>
without any mechanical linkage to a linear reaction mass.<br>
<p>
[[The type of mechanism is irrelevant. It is the net result that <br>
matters,<br>
and there is no experimental evidence for the above result .]]<br>
<p>
. While this is not so important on<br>
the ground or in the air or water, where there is always more reaction<br>
mass available, in space you must carry your reaction mass with <br>
yourself<br>
in order to be able to maneuver and navigate the vast reaches. <br>
<p>
[[Not necessarily- laser/maser sails, accelerators, tethers and other <br>
momentum <br>
transfer techniques are serious contenders.]]<br>
<p>
 ...However, if you were able to speed each<br>
mass up at one point in the orbit, and slow it down again on the <br>
opposite<br>
side of the centrifuge, you would have a point in the centrifuge where<br>
all masses were going slowly on that side, and fast on the opposite <br>
side.<br>
This would produce excess centrifugal force in a direction straight out<br>
from the point of highest velocity.... <br>
Over here on the right side, where the masses move fastest, is where <br>
the excess<br>
centrifugal force is generated. This translates into linear thrust..<br>
<p>
[[Which is precisely canceled by the forces on the mechanism that<br>
accelerates the masses.<br>
