Doesn't *doing* presuppose *identity* presuppose *existence*?  Do you <br>
identify yourself with only the top of this hierarchy, as actions <br>
independent of the being to which they are ascribed?  Am I reading to <br>
much into your words!?<br>
<p>
I ask b/c I too place great value on my actions-- Becoming as opposed to <br>
mere existence.  However, I am not inclined to leave my being-&gt; <br>
identity behind. <br>
The person that performs my actions has spent great effort to become this <br>
being (that I call "me"), one whose actions are progressively more <br>
effective and rewarding. (please pardon my pronouns!)  The person who <br>
decides what goal to pursue and what actions to take in its pursuit is <br>
the one who defines their worth (actions and goals). That Beings purpose <br>
is to Become.<br>

Ego.<br>
