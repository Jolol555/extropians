Ever since I became a devout atheist ridding myself of the meme of<br>
christianity I've funneled my creativity into logic while stifling it. I am<br>
quite the optimist now but when I was younger I was chronically depressed<br>
but I learned to control it and with that control went my creativity. Is<br>
there a link between depression and creativity? Perhaps I need a round of<br>
bad luck or two? I have been able to feel my creative side as though it<br>
were tangible through certain types of music but can't quite grasp it. When<br>
I was younger I used to be quite the horticulturist. Perhaps I need to get<br>
back in touch with nature? Maybe I need to bring out my creative side<br>
through mysticism such as wicca or other so-called new age religions?<br>
Christianity was a tool that allowed a channel into my creative side. With<br>
my increasing belief that things are ever more structuralized and logical I<br>
seem to be losing creativity first and following that, emotion. Maybe I<br>
need to surround myself with creative people and artists and bring it back.<br>
What do you suggest? Please help!<br>
