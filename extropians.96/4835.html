Good point! Socially intelligent people of course have much better <br>
potential to rise in the pecking order, while other forms of intelligence <br>
doesn't help in this field, except if the owner can apply them for a <br>
status-enhancing activity of some kind. <br>

Actually, the witchhunts were not particularly directed against smart<br>
women despite the popular myth. Their memetic epidemology was surprisingly<br>
similar to the current wave of worry about sexual abuse (not to mention<br>
satanic ritual abuse); the Stockholm witch trials were uncomfortably<br>
similar to some of the hysteria against pedophiles right now. Such<br>
memidemics seem to attack people with weak social connections, i.e people<br>
with less-than-average social intelligence or no strong ties to the<br>
in-groups. <br>
<p>
Still, the myth that high semantic intelligence implies low social <br>
intelligence seems rather recent. It is perhaps best represented by the <br>
idea of the absentminded professor or the asocial hacker. <br>
<p>
It may be a version of the "you can't be best in everything"-meme: many <br>
people believe you can't be both smart, beautiful and successful at the same <br>
time. This was probably originally a way to console oneself ("money can't <br>
buy happiness") or others, since otherwise the self-image would be hurt <br>
by the fact that one wasn't as good at everything. <br>
<p>
A wild guess: the myth about intelligence appeared when we began to move<br>
into an technological society, where most of the people were dependent on<br>
experts (engineers, doctors, scientists) that held valuable knowledge they<br>
didn't possess. <br>
<p>
If this hypothesis holds, then we should see a lessening of the belief<br>
"semantic intelligence precludes social intelligence" in areas where the<br>
knowledge is becoming widespread (like in parts of the computer industry)<br>
and an increase in areas where new cadres of experts are developing, as<br>
well as a time-correlation between technologisation and the spread of the<br>
belief in different nations. Any data on this? Perhaps checking popular<br>
literature would be a good idea. <br>
