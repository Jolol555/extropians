Damien Broderick: <br>
<i>&gt; If we accept the argument in Drexler et al (UNBOUNDING THE </i><br>
<i>&gt; FUTURE, 1991, p. 259), </i><br>
<p>
Before continuing, let's have a look at that page.  Eric Drexler says: <br>
<i>&gt; In the long run, it seems wise to assume that someone, somewhere, </i><br>
<i>&gt; somehow, will escape the bounds of regulation and arm control </i><br>
<i>&gt; and apply molecular-manufacturing capabilities to making novel </i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons... </i><br>
<p>
This is not an argument, it's just a scenario.  At this point in the book, <br>
he takes it for granted that there is such a thing as molecular <br>
manufacturing, which can be used to make weapons.  The arguments  <br>
for this are given much earlier.  <br>
<p>
Of course, it is wise to assume that somebody may escape the bounds of <br>
regulation and use *any* technology to make weapons.  This concern is <br>
independent of the technology used.  He could say "biotechnology" <br>
instead of "molecular manufacturing," and the point would still be valid.  <br>
As far as that goes, some people make effective weapons with fertilizer <br>
and fuel oil.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, Damien continues: <br>
<i>&gt; the only way to stop some demented or feckless brat from </i><br>
<i>&gt; reprogramming his genie to emit meteorological quantities Aum </i><br>
<i>&gt; Supreme Truth happy gas, or pick plutonoium out of the sea and </i><br>
<i>&gt; stockpile it for later fun times, is to maintain strong regulatory </i><br>
<i>&gt; authorities which licence users of genies able to produce dangerous </i><br>
<i>&gt; outputs only if these are restricted to sealed assembler labs or </i><br>
<i>&gt; factories.  This rather short-sheets the utopian dream of a genie in </i><br>
<i>&gt; every pocket, but I find it hard to see any other way to forestall the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fermi Paradox.  </i><br>
<p>
to which Anders Sandberg replies: <br>
<i>&gt; The other obvious way is to get the hell away from Earth as soon </i><br>
<i>&gt; (or better, before) we get that level of MNT. </i><br>
<p>
Well, an even better way to deal with this is to get the idea in focus,  <br>
and see that it is basically absurd.  Making sarin with diamondoid-based <br>
assemblers is not going to be any easier than making sarin with <br>
biotechnology, or with conventional chemical synthesis.  In fact it <br>
would be harder.  <br>
<p>
You could design a cell to synthesize sarin.  It would take a long time.  <br>
It would take some expensive lab equipment, and some biochemists and <br>
biotechnicians with hard-to-acquire skills, but it could be done.  <br>
Cells produce a lot of other toxins similar to sarin.  (There may already <br>
be a cell that produces sarin; I don't know.  In that case, your only <br>
problem would be to produce large quantities of it.)  <br>
<p>
Designing a diamondoid-based assembler to make sarin would be much <br>
harder, because diamondoid machinery is intended to work with other <br>
diamondoid machinery.  Organic molecules like sarin don't fit into the <br>
neat diamondoid world of molecular manufacturing.  <br>
<p>
If somebody wants to claim that the diamondoid genie machine will <br>
reprogram itself for free, so all you have to say is "I want a ton of sarin," <br>
and presto, it appears... all I can say at this point is:  balderdash.  <br>
<p>
Designing and programming machinery to perform complex tasks <br>
isn't going to get any easier in the 21st century.  It will always be a job <br>
for experts.  Programming will not be free or instantaneous in the future <br>
any more than it is now.  <br>
