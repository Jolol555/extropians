Subject: Noam Chomsky--Fake Anarchist?<br>
<p>
A-albionic Research "Weekly Up-date" of 10-15-96<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
Quote from the back cover of _Class Warfare_: Interviews with David<br>
Barsamian--A Powerful Road Map to the Emerging Global Capitalism by Noam<br>
Chomsky ($15.00 in-stock at A-albionic)  we find:<br>
<p>
"Why is this supporter of anarchist ideals in favor of strengthening the<br>
Federal Government?"<br>
<p>
Inside we find:<br>
<p>
page 122:  "In the long term I think the centralized political power ought<br>
to be eliminated and dissolved and turned down ultimately to the local<br>
level, finally, with federalism and associations and so on . . . On the<br>
other hand, right now I'd like to strengthen the Federal Government.  The<br>
reason is, we live in this world, not some other world.  And in this world<br>
there happen to be huge concentrations of private power which are as close<br>
to tyranny and as close to totalitarian as anything humans have devised,<br>
and they have extraordinary power.  They are unaccountable to the public.<br>
There's only one way of defending rights that have been attained or<br>
extending their scope in the face of these private powers, and that's to<br>
maintain the one form of illegitimate power that happens to be somewhat<br>
responsive to the public and which the public can indeed influence.  So<br>
you end up supporting centralized state power even though you oppose it.<br>
People who think there is a contradiction in that just aren't thinking<br>
very clearly."<br>
<p>
Lloyd's Comment:  Is this guy just unaware that the Federal Government,<br>
from the Federal Reserve to the FDA to the FTA and the rest of the<br>
alphabet soup is the prized possession of the major Corporations and that<br>
they, and only they, can control the Federal Government?  And what about<br>
the Corporations' power to put over GATT, the WTO, NAFTA, etc ETC?<br>
<p>
	But he is aware cuz on pages 149-150, just for one example, we<br>
see:<br>
<p>
"Take the cutback of the regulatory apparatus . . . big investment firms<br>
are very unhappy about it.  They need the Securities and Exchange<br>
Commission. . .Markets cost a lot of money to set up and a lot of money to<br>
police. . .So the big guys, . . . rely on the SEC as government<br>
intervention to protect the functioning of markets to the extent that they<br>
exist, which is a limited but not zero extent. . .The Commerce Department<br>
is now under attack by the Republican freshmen.  But big business wants<br>
it.  It just puts money into their pockets.  The Commerce Department is<br>
one of the welfare systems for the rich and they don't want that to<br>
disappear. . .Republican freshman attack was going right after<br>
environmental issues. . .beaten back on that one, to a large extent<br>
because big corporations who can think five years ahead realize that they<br>
would like to have a world five years from now in which they can make<br>
profits, not only for today. . .same with the FDA. . .pharmaceutical<br>
corporations came out against dismantling the Food and Drug<br>
Administration. . .smart enough to figure out that if there is no<br>
regulation and independent assessment, five years from now there will be<br>
some kind of thalidomide catastrophe or something. . .And so it goes.<br>
There has always been a symbiotic relationship between big private capital<br>
and state power.  They want to maintain it."<br>
<p>
Lloyd's Comment:  Soooo!  Is Chomsky and idiot or an agent?  Well, at MIT,<br>
he is feeding from the Federal trough.  He admits it elsewhere in _Class<br>
Warfare_.  On the other hand, maybe this railer about the "democracy<br>
deficit" really does believe that "democracy" is possible, not just a<br>
fraudulent fantasy promoted to obtain the "consent of the governed" by the<br>
elite behind the major Corporations.  Can he really believe that Federal<br>
Regulations are designed for the benificent purposes he states above?<br>
Can't he see that from Banking to the FDA to the EPA Federal regulations<br>
are designed to cartelize and increase monopoly profits, foreclosing the<br>
type of decentralized system left-anarchist claim to want?<br>
<p>
You be the judge!  Conspiracy or error?  Just a beneficent co-incidence<br>
that Chomsky lines up completely with the Class Warfare doctrines of the<br>
Democratic Party?<br>
