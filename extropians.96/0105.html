<i>&gt;Thanks!  Makes sense, with a few fuzzy spots that probably stem from</i><br>
<i>&gt;my own ignorance.  I like the idea that the next step in a long term</i><br>
<i>&gt;plan to accomplish a goal doesn't change much when you change the</i><br>
<i>&gt;goal.  I'm not too clear on the distinction between extrinsic and</i><br>
<i>&gt;intrinsic goals, though.</i><br>
<p>
Intrinsic goal: get some honey. Why? Because you just happen to want some<br>
honey.<br>
<p>
Extrinsic goal: raise bees. You don't really care about the bees, you just<br>
want the honey. This is why Aristotle said that extrinsic goals partake of<br>
drudgery. Of course, this is a specifically extrinsic goal (it doesn't help<br>
you with anything other than getting honey), not a generalizably extrinsic<br>
goal like seeking truth or dealing justly with your fellows.<br>
<p>
Not having to change the next step in your long term plan when your long<br>
term goal changes is especially helpful when you have no idea exactly what<br>
it is you're going to be doing in two centuries.  ;)  A nice aspect of<br>
generalizable extrinsicity is that it makes it possible to live rationally<br>
without any specific long-term goals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think I make a smaller whimsical decision than you do.  If I run</i><br>
<i>&gt;around chopping off people's heads, then eventually they'll get</i><br>
<i>&gt;together and stop me, probably by doing something functionally</i><br>
<i>&gt;equivalent to chopping off my head.  (We're talking unfriendly human</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction here, not neurosuspension.  :-) Thus running around</i><br>
<i>&gt;chopping off people's heads isn't part of any long-term plan.  So</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of whimsically deciding to constrain your goals to accord to</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural law, you can whimsically decide to have a long-term plan.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This (to me) feels like a smaller assumption, especially because I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't know what you mean by "natural law".</i><br>
<p>
It sounds like you and I are talking about the same thing, except that I<br>
wasn't able to wash off all the technical jargon implicit in the<br>
complicated (but, I hope, precise) argument that I may be trying to make<br>
someday.<br>
<p>
"Natural law" is the sticking point you run into when people start saying<br>
"good and bad are entirely subjective". Nobody worth discussing these<br>
things with really believes, deep down inside, that the wrongness of murder<br>
is entirely subjective. To me, natural law means the stuff that human<br>
societies have universally found it wise to prohibit, through trial and<br>
error over the course of history. This is a fuzzy set, of course. It's the<br>
kind of thing you'd find on the law books of extreme minarchist<br>
libertarians (like maybe Rothbard). It's a weird idea, but it's an<br>
important one to me.<br>
<p>
I'm beginning to suspect that values are on a tree-like spectrum, and at<br>
one end you have mere matters of taste and mood, twigs branching and waving<br>
and changing from person to person and time to time, and at the other end<br>
you have the "trunk" of the "natural law": the prohibitions against murder<br>
and plunder, the stuff that *everyone* really knows is wrong. The middle<br>
branches in between these two extremes are what I think most people tend to<br>
mean by "morality", especially when they're inveighing against it. But the<br>
sort of morality that I'm interested in is the stuff at the trunk, which it<br>
seems can neither be wished away nor adequately explained. Yet.<br>
<p>
They're weird ideas, sure, but I don't really know how to get away from<br>
them. So I keep thinking about them from time to time. It's a hobby.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sounds interesting.  Can you post a reference?</i><br>

Um, Gauthier deals with justice only, I think. The review I wrote of his<br>
book is up on the web at<br>

<p>
He comes at this problem from two directions: the prisoner's dilemma and<br>
the problem of externalities in economics, and he comes up with a newish<br>
theory of rational behavior (contra Harsanyi and the classical game theory<br>
crowd), a "constrained maximization" that seeks optimal outcomes instead of<br>
equilibrium outcomes in those situations in which the optimum and the<br>
equilibrium don't coincide. The easiest way to try to sum up his theory, I<br>
think, is that it represents a solution to the prisoner's dilemma which is<br>
midway between Axelrod's TIT-FOR-TAT (which can't be demonstrated rational<br>
in one-shot interactions) and Hofstadter's "superrationality" from<br>
Metamagical Themas, which ethical skeptics have a hard time with.<br>
