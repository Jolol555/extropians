I'm not following what is being left unsaid in this thread.<br>
<p>
I expected this to be a high-quality low-noise ML that I'd have to <br>
pay a subscription fee for. My personal jury's still out on the<br>
quality &amp; noise issues, but one prior comment says something about <br>
Max More "opening" the ML.<br>
<p>
So, forgive my ignorance, but what gives? Is nobody going to bill me? <br>
In that case, I may very well unsubscribe; I was interested in seeing <br>
what the fee structure weeded out, if anything.<br>
<p>
 It was a tough decision to try this out because I didn't know what the <br>
billing structure was, and I was worried that I'd like it more than I was <br>
willing to pay for it.<br>
