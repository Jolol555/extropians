<i>&gt;From: my inner geek &lt;geek@ifeden.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;Subject: Hypertext, Copyrights, and Royalty Distribution</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do any extropians know of any client/server solutions for royalty</i><br>
<i>&gt;distribution in the age of "all digital media on demand?"</i><br>
<p>
Ted Nelson proposes the idea of "transcopyright."  I'll ask him for a<br>
pointer to his own description, but basically the idea is for publishers<br>
to copyright things, but with permission given to *refer to* the material by<br>
URL.  Then it's between the original publisher's and readers' computers to<br>
negotiate payment before any quoted material is delivered.<br>
<p>
The cool thing here is that it's purely a legal permissions idea, like<br>
Gnu Public License and Shareware are, and the technical details can be<br>
ironed out by different people trying different things.<br>
<p>
Of course it does rely on the legal/moral idea of copyright.<br>
<p>
Another idea is to scrap copyright and royalty and go to a prepayment<br>
scheme for information.  Here, a creator of information is paid<br>
a lump sum based on the expected revenue from distributing what he's<br>
coming up with.  I saw a funny enlightening talk by Eric Hughes called "A<br>
Robust System for Copyright Enfringement", which started out talking about<br>
ways info-pirates could carry on safely and profitably in public, and<br>
segued into how information creators could use the same methods to<br>
distribute and be paid for their work.  He goes into how the money to<br>
produce movies is raised ahead of time, with arrangements like non-<br>
delivery insurance, etc., as a partial model for financing any kind of<br>
information production and distribution.<br>
