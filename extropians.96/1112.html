<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;By "objective," I mean that most reasonable people would agree the</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;disinterested party could recreate the experiment and come up with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;same results.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'd say these criteria are met by most of the experiments in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;tradition I'm involved with (experimental economics).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That may be the case -- it would be more convincing if you provided some</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know how to do this other than have you read some of the<br>
literature.  See the journals American Economic Review or Econometrica.<br>
How could you show this for any other field any easier?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And would you claim the same is true for most experiments in sociology and</i><br>
<i>&gt;political science?</i><br>
<p>
Political Science, yes.  Sociology, I think yes (I don't know that <br>
subject as much though).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Nope, there is plenty of experimentation in astronomy and geology.  Didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;astronomers prove that gravity can bend light waves through an experiment?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Um, no.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Since the fixed stars in the parts of the sky near the sun become visible</i><br>
<i>&gt;during a total eclipse, it is possible to check this theoretical conclusion</i><br>
<i>&gt;[a ray of light coming from a fixed star and just grazing the border of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sun will be deflected by 0.83 seconds of an arc] by experiment."</i><br>
<p>
This isn't an "experiment" in the sense that you've been using -<br>
control over variables.  They only looked.  They didn't go move the<br>
sun around or anything.  The closest you get is using signals from<br>
spacecraft, where you control where the spacecraft goes.  That is a<br>
small fraction of astronomy (though a large fraction of planetary<br>
astronomy).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You can bring a small number of people into a lab and run an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;experiment on them, and then do it again tommorow and get similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;results.  You can also vary just one aspect of your experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your first statement may be true for psychology and microeconomics.  But is</i><br>
<i>&gt;it true for sociology, political science, and macroeconomics?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But note that most medical research relies on objective measurements</i><br>
<i>&gt;(e.g., size of a tumor, number of white blood cells per CC, etc.).  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would think (but I could be wrong) most social science experiments on</i><br>
<i>&gt;human subjects conducted in a lab rely primarily on what the subjects</i><br>
<i>&gt;say.</i><br>
<p>
First, what subject say *is* objectively measurable.<br>
Second, Most econ and polisci experiments rely on what people do, not<br>
what they say.<br>
