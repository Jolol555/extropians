<i>&gt;     In all my dealings with others, I try to be as open and revealing of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;inner most thoughts as possible. I reject totally the idea that "white lies"</i><br>
<i>&gt;are OK. Furthermore, I have stated many times that my desire to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communuicate with fidelity what I am is so great (and I seem not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish this by standard interpersonal methods), that I would very much</i><br>
<i>&gt;welcome a human augmentation which would allow us all to transmit and receive</i><br>
<i>&gt;each others thoughts. I have stated that if such an augmentation were possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally better</i><br>
<i>&gt;world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever they</i><br>
<i>&gt;liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My basic point here is to question the rationality of anyone valuing privacy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's hear what others think of this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I personally would *never* give up my RIGHT to privacy, even though I will<br>
usually share, quite openly, what I think.  <br>
<p>
I believe the real problem emerges when some individuals have more rights to<br>
privacy than others.  This creates a power imbalance.  Think about the<br>
government.  Can you honestly say that you, as an individual, you can have<br>
the same level of privacy as an agency of the government?  As any military<br>
person will tell you, intelligence (information context) is a very valuable<br>
asset that can greatly increase the power and effectiveness of any<br>
organization.  When someone has access to all the information about you, but<br>
you have none on them, this gives them a significant edge should a some form<br>
of power struggle occur.<br>
<p>
Since I don't believe that everyone will ever have the same level of<br>
privacy, I try to retain as much as I can.<br>
