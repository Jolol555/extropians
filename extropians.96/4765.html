EY&gt; I see the Holocaust as a horrendous tragedy, and if someone<br>
EY&gt; smaller than me made a joke about it, I'd punch his lights out.<br>
<p>
That attitude is far more likely to lead to violence and hatred<br>
than a spoof like _Springtime for Hitler_.  It is precisely such<br>
unhealthy emotional attachment to certain ideas--"sacred cows"--<br>
that closes otherwise functional minds to different ideas.  Humor<br>
is a valuable tool, because much of what is funny is funny because<br>
it's unexpected, unorthodox, and therefore mind-expanding.<br>
<p>
Humor can be used to break out of mental blocks caused by extreme<br>
emotions--the way emergency room doctors use gallows humor, or the<br>
way things like Challenger jokes and Chris Reeve jokes inevitably<br>
follow such events to help get our minds back on track.  Those who<br>
find such things "tasteless" are deficient in two respects: they<br>
are allowing an indefinable abstraction like "taste" cloud their<br>
rational values, and they are willfully evading reality, because<br>
they usually have to suppress their natural urge to laugh at things<br>
that really are funny.<br>
<p>
Also, humor can help soften the emotional impact of ideas that are<br>
so far apart from the orthodoxy that they would otherwise be seen<br>
and dismissed as absurd.  After one gang of usenetters who take<br>
themselves far too seriously created alt.save.the.earth, a second<br>
group created alt.pave.the.earth to make fun of them, but also to<br>
expose the serious mistakes of many enviro-fundies.  Serious<br>
discussions did go on in both groups, but the humorus nature of<br>
the latter made the discussions freer and less self-censored.<br>
<p>
Dogmatism of any kind--especially when it appears benevolent and<br>
peaceful--is dangerous, and humor is a valuable tool to fight it.<br>
If you can't make fun of yourself, your mind will never grow.<br>
