<i>&gt;My current approach to "incremental" is in terms of the intellectual</i><br>

<p>
I wonder if this advocacy of contract entails a repudiation of property?<br>
<p>
Dipleased with how copyright works as a property right, I've been researching<br>
of late how to contractulize rights to expressive works.  While this scheme<br>
would not "privatize" copyright, which already allows privately held<br>
property, it would privatize the decision process through which rights to<br>
expressive works (e.g., works that qualify for copyright) get assigned.<br>
<p>
The more I continue in this train of thought, the more attractive contract<br>
appears as an alternative to property.  Or, rather, the more attractive it<br>
appears as a complementary way of framing economic relations.  I sometimes<br>
think of contract as the wave side of something like a particle/wave duality.<br>
