<p>
I don't know if you could do the same with a $1500 budget, but I suppose you<br>
could come close if you really worked your equipment.  I've seen people do<br>
amazing stuff on a very minimalist setup.  I don't generally consider Ace of<br>
Base to be quality music anyway (from a musical standpoint).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What kind of techno did you play?</i><br>
<p>
My style was greatly affected by my mood at the moment, and I have tried<br>
almost every style at one time or another, but in general I stayed in 4 genres:<br>
<p>
1) HardCore/Industrial ala Front Line Assembly, Front 242, but usually only<br>
the dense, complicated synth texture style.<br>
2) Trance/Ambient ala Opus III, Orbital (brown albumish), The Orb, DJ<br>
Spooky, Deep Forest, Cabaret Voltaire, etc.  A pretty broad range here, but<br>
definitely one of my favorite genres.<br>
3) Techno (for lack of a more distinguishing term) ala Messiah, Eon, Utah<br>
Saints, etc.  <br>
4) Low-key Euro-synth pop.  Not the happy, upbeat stuff, but the slower,<br>
depressing, more organic varieties.  The Blue Nile, Some Pet Shop Boys, to<br>
name a couple examples.<br>
<p>
I have been kind of itching to get back into the business for a while.  The<br>
only thing that keeps me from doing it is the initial investment.  I don't<br>
have a single piece of gear anymore, so the cost of starting over is<br>
prohibitive.  Unfortunately, I am used to working on some pretty decent gear<br>
in a pretty tight setup.  I suspect my minimum requirements for equipment<br>
are somewhat higher than they need to be.  I will probably take the plunge<br>
in the middle of next year.  I might even open another studio eventually.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If I spent that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; much money on equipment I would make damn sure I did SOMETHING productive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's amazing how many people spend a lot of money on gear and then never do</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything with it.</i><br>
<p>
For that matter, it's amazing how many people live and never doing anything<br>
with their lives either.<br>
<p>
Its not what you have, but what you do with what you have.<br>
