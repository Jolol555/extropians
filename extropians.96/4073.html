<i>&gt;I'll make it simple, Hal.  Name a free society, any time, anywhere, in</i><br>

<i>&gt;correlative factor was nearly always how well  people could hold their</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaders accountable, while personal secrecy varied according to culture and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology, almost at right angles to freedom.  Scandinavians, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;instance, have high freedom, high courtesy, low nosiness... and rather low</i><br>
<i>&gt;degrees of personal secrecy.  Any citizen can look up a lot of info about</i><br>
<i>&gt;his/her neighbors.  Nudity is common, etc.  things were much the same in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the oldest democracy, Iceland.</i><br>
<p>
 I will suggest Switzerland as an example of a fairly high-secrecy,<br>
high-freedom country that doesn't fit your correlation well.<br>
 But I suspect the correlation you see is real. That doesn't make it<br>
obvious what is cause and what is effect. I find it easy to imagine<br>
that both freedom and low demand for secrecy are the result of high<br>
degrees of tolerance, and that freedom and secrecy have no measurable<br>
causal effect on each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ah, but to your enemies, what YOU call privacy seems a lot like concealing</i><br>
<i>&gt;from them what they need to know about your nefarious schemes and nasty</i><br>
<i>&gt;conspiracies.   Is it impossible to imagine that you, Hal Finney, as you</i><br>
<i>&gt;get deservedly rich and powerful, might be perceived as part of a power</i><br>
<i>&gt;bloc who someone else worries about?  This RELATIVE aspect of secrecy --</i><br>
<i>&gt;that your "privacy" might be someone elses "unaccountability" is a feature</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is completely different that freedom, where my freedom is enhanced by</i><br>
<i>&gt;increasing your freedom.</i><br>
<p>
 What do privacy and accountability have to do with each other? I think<br>
we all agree that government accountability is important for producing<br>
freedom, and if you had a clear argument that accountability was inversely<br>
proportional to privacy, I would admit you had a strong argument.<br>
 But I have no trouble imagining conditions under which total privacy<br>
and total accountability coexist. My attempts to hold the account<br>
brin@cts.com accountable for the ideas it emits will probably not be<br>
hindered if I am unable to trace it to a human, committee, AI or whatever<br>
else might control it. I can hold Chrysler accountable for the quality<br>
of its cars by reading Consumer Reports much more easily than by methods<br>
which require that Chrysler give up some privacy. In a completely free<br>
society, I could hold the U.S. government accountable by checking whether<br>
people who subscribed to its services are better off than those who<br>
subscribe to Switzerland's services, and do business with whichever<br>
was better (in a free society I could switch in much the same way I<br>
can switch insurance companies).<br>
 The way governments currently operate, there is some need to limit<br>
their privacy (i.e. we need to know which congresscritters voted for<br>
which laws), but I see no sign that tools such as PGP threaten this<br>
accountability.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of the five dangerous power centers in the world today, government,</i><br>
<i>&gt;aristo-oligarchies, criminals, religions and the techno elite, you ONLY</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk about government!  The tools of secrecy you tout will help the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;four to conspire... and by human nature, they certainly will.  They already</i><br>
<i>&gt;do.</i><br>
<p>
 I agree that having different rules for government employees is<br>
suspect (I want governments to become competing corporations with<br>
no monopolistic claims of jurisdiction, so I don't want them to<br>
have different rights than other corporations). I am even more puzzled<br>
by your belief that secrecy will make religions noticeably more<br>
dangerous than by your belief that it will make governments more<br>
dangerous.<br>
