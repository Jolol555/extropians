Good grief!  Do you think TWA800 would be a big cover-up?  Apparently, you<br>
only have access to Establish news outlets!<br>
<p>
Ever hear of the Whitewater Cover-up, the WACO cover-up, the Ruby Ridge<br>
cover-up, the Ron Brown crash cover-up, the OKC Bomb cover-up,<br>
Iran-Contra, CIA Drug Running at the Mena airport, etc. etc.?  How about<br>
the failed war on drugs?  FDA oppression and cover-up of the value of<br>
nutrients in life extention, etc?  Or the failed war on poverty.<br>
<p>
Is everyone but Ian Goddard asleep on this list?  Or reading nothing but<br>
science books?<br>
<p>
If Extropians are for self-ownership I find it hard to fathom if only a<br>
few are aware that "self-ownership" far from complete in this increasingly<br>
Statist society.<br>

<i>&gt; all those involved in the investigation have the exact same ethical matrix?</i><br>

<i>&gt; Because a big secret is major leverage in a town based on influence.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets used for leverage over and over again, until it becomes tattered and</i><br>
<i>&gt; exposed.  And the current people are well aware that a cover-up is</i><br>
<i>&gt; more disastrous to political collateral than exposing the truth.  The big</i><br>
<i>&gt; guys can always find a scapegoat to take the rap for a mess-up, but a</i><br>
<i>&gt; real cover-up always leads to the top, they don't want that.  Do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; really think Clinton would take the risk of being involved in the biggest</i><br>
<i>&gt; cover-up of the decade during an election year, when the truth exposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; would just result in the sacking of some navy brass?  Get logical here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; please.  Remember, the X-files is just television, filmed in Vancouver B.C.</i><br>
