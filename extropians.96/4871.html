Just as a general line of thought, specifically what is involved in memetic<br>
engineering?  What are the steps and procedures involved?<br>
<p>
On a macroscopic level historical memes seem to follow some very basic<br>
patterns and models.  Can this be applied on a microscopic level to<br>
influence specific targets?  <br>
<p>
Would it be possible to build a piece of software that could simulate and<br>
predict the evolution of a meme?  Would it be possible to build a piece of<br>
software that could aid in the design of complex memes?  Or a piece of<br>
software that could model memes?<br>
<p>
A memetic modelling tool could have some very interesting applications.  If<br>
a "good" modelling/engineering tool was designed, couldn't this give small<br>
organizations enormously disproportionate amounts of influence?<br>
<p>
Comments?<br>
