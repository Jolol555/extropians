As the story is developing, it appears that the documents that <br>
Salinger has may be nothing more than the document previously <br>
circulated around the internet. I would be surprised that Salinger<br>
would be so ill informed about the story and about the internet<br>
to assume he had new info.<br>
<p>
If that is all he has, well I really overreacted, D'oh !<br>
I expected such an experienced reported as he is would have<br>
known the topic and been very sure of the veracity of the<br>
documentation he is in possession of. Reuters says he got<br>
it from a U.S. Secret Service agent who also "showed him" <br>
how the Navy hit the plane. <br>
<p>
However, I would note that the internet document in question <br>
has not been proven false in any way other than the say-so of <br>
potentially guilty officials -- "we weren't there." Yet initial<br>
reports said the Navy was there at the time.<br>
<p>
In fact, when just asked at a press conference earlier today <br>
if the Navy ever uses the area in question -- which the inter-<br>
net message said is a known test area -- for missile testing, <br>
Navy Admiral Edward Kristensen, in charge of this case for <br>
the Navy, said the area below the flight is:<br>
<p>
	"Not typicality used for missile training."<br>
<p>
When pressed further on this point later on in the conference he said:<br>
<p>
	"Not to my knowledge have missiles been fired there."<br>
<p>
These are clearly not clear "yes" or "no" answers. Considering <br>
that this question is KEY to disproving the Internet report, <br>
and that the Admiral has had weeks to get the story right, <br>
I find his answers totally unsatisfactory and suspect.<br>
<p>
As to Ira's claim to enjoying battling "clueless paranoids" --<br>
i.e., those guilty of the sin of skeptical inquiry regarding <br>
proven to be false and misleading GovtMedia new feed -- I'd note<br>
that I've presented much evidence of GovtMedia conspiracy and <br>
have not seen Ira disprove a single feature of any theory. This <br>
document, listing many such case, was posted here in reply to <br>
a request to prove that some conspiracies are true:<br>
