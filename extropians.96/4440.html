Extropes,<br>
<p>
You may or may not have heard about Carl Sagan's death this morning. I've<br>
known about his illness for some time, because my oldest friend works(ed)<br>
for him at Cornell. I'm very sorry, I didn't get a chance to talk to<br>
her and Sagan's family about cryonics. He's completely dead, I'm<br>
very sad to say.<br>
<p>
Here is an "official" announcement about Sagan's death from NASA headquarters.<br>
After that is an announcement from the Fred Hutchinson Center, where<br>
Sagan was undergoing bone marrow transplants off and on during the last<br>
two years.<br>

RELEASE:  96-266<br>
<p>
<p>
STATEMENT BY NASA ADMINISTRATOR DAN GOLDIN<br>
ON THE PASSING OF ASTRONOMER CARL SAGAN<br>
<p>
     "All of us at NASA are saddened by the passing of Carl<br>
Sagan.  For more than three decades, Dr. Sagan was an<br>
eloquent, passionate voice for the sciences that he so ably<br>
advanced.<br>
<p>
     As much as any scientific figure of our time, Carl<br>
described for an entire generation -- the generation of the<br>
Space Age -- the true wonders of the Universe around us.  His<br>
unbelievable ability to explain the complexities of space and<br>
space exploration inspired people to look up into the night<br>
sky in wonder.  Through such efforts as the television series<br>
'Cosmos' and his recent book, 'Pale Blue Dot,' Carl reached -<br>
- and touched --millions around the world.<br>
<p>
     He was a pioneer of the idea that life could exist on<br>
Mars, years before NASA was able to uncover evidence of<br>
potential early life on the Red Planet, and he was an<br>
important voice in our Mars science programs for many years.<br>
He was an early champion of the idea that the two leading<br>
spacefaring powers, America and Russia, should work together<br>
in the exploration of space.<br>
<p>
     He also was at the forefront of constructing humanity's<br>
first messages to the stars, which even now are hurtling out<br>
of our Solar System aboard the Pioneer and Voyager<br>
spacecraft.  Carl himself likened the effort to the launching<br>
of a message in a bottle on the interstellar ocean.  We will<br>
remember his vision, his eloquence, and his intellect, and we<br>
will miss him."<br>
<p>
                           -end-<br>

Below is a statement issued by Fred Hutchinson Center for Annie:<br>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Astronomer, educator, author, pioneer in exobiology, Director for<br>
Planetary Studies, and David Duncan Professor of Cornell University,<br>
Dr. Carl Sagan succumbed to pneumonia today December 20, 1996 after a<br>
two year battle with bone marrow disease.  He fought as tenaciously<br>
and courageously for his life as he did for the values of science and<br>
democracy.  He is survived by his wife and collaborator, Ann Druyan, his<br>
sister Cari Sagan Greene, his children: Dorion, Jeremy, Nicholas, Sasha,<br>
and Sam, and by his grandson, Tonio.  He is also survived by his in-laws,<br>
Harry and Pearl Druyan.<br>
<p>
In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to The Children's Health<br>
Fund of New York or The Planetary Society of Pasadena, California.<br>
<p>
<p>
Condolences can be sent to his office at Cornell, in care of his secretary:<br>
