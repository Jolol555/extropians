I think Hal's point is that we don't really know what such a problem<br>
would look like, or how to tell once we have one.  So you run a<br>
simulatio and somewhere in it are some real smart creatures.  How can<br>
you tell where they are, or figure out how to harness them once you<br>
do?  And how do you know what simulations would create such smart<br>
creatures?<br>
