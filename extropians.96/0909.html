I've read about past fears that building increasingly powerful particle<br>
accelerators have the potential to create strange matter which is a more<br>
stable form of matter that would instantly convert all matter around it into<br>
this new form. Is there any potential of this occurring? If so should we<br>
build particle accelerators on asteroids instead of Earth? Also what is the<br>
potential that this could be used in the future as a type of planetary<br>
warfare where a chunk of strange matter could be shot into the atmosphere of<br>
another planet and convert all the matter on that planet to strange matter<br>
therefore turning the entire planet into a mass of absolute physical entropy<br>
since all the elemental properties would differ. Also what would a dark<br>
matter life form be like and would it be possible to make things out of dark<br>
matter?<br>
