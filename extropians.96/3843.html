Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt;As a friend remarked "Me and my intellectual friends were always arguing</i><br>
<i>&gt;about whether Kraftwerk were fascists or ironic about fascism". My own</i><br>
<i>&gt;impression of them is fascination and ambivalence to technology that can</i><br>
<i>&gt;turn in both directions. </i><br>
<p>
You've brought up a point that I was thinking about last night after <br>
posting my reply.  Are we as transhumanists willing to accept, learn <br>
from or even value ambivalence regarding technological progress?  Are <br>
we able to laugh at our own hubris and draw strength from that?  <br>
<p>
The humorous irony that suffuses most of Kraftwerk's compositions <br>
always brings a smile to my face, especially the song they wrote <br>
about the old-style pocket calculators that had musical tones <br>
attached to the number keys.  Of course, my view is utterly biased, <br>
as I am madly crushed on Ralf+Florian+Fritz!<br>
<p>
