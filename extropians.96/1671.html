This is probably one of my personally most despised memes. It is of VERY<br>
popular opinion that you need bad times to have good times. Things can<br>
evolve and become better forever which blatently proves that this is false<br>
and yet people still can't grasp the concept. There is always something<br>
better than you currently are experiencing.<br>
