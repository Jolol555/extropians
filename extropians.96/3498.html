<i>&gt; *VERY* good point! Lets stir up some contravercy shall we? We could take it</i><br>
<i>&gt; a step further and claim that if christianity considers science satan than</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could revel in the fact that we're satan worshippers!</i><br>
<p>
No offense here, but I can't help but think that that's the single worst<br>
idea I've heard on this entire mailing list.  We'd - no, you'd - lose<br>
all credibility, firmly establish your credentials as a teenage-class<br>
rebellious challenger of the Establishment, and completely confuse the<br>
issue so that you wind up being taken down with the apocalyptic loons.<br>
<p>
Let's all remember that the Singularity may well be before 2000, so we<br>
can't get them to claim it will be in 2000 and then watch them be<br>
overtaken by the future.  They may be wind up being right!  There are a<br>
number of ways to start and sabotage a movement so that they wind up<br>
being rightly regarded by everyone else as apocalyptic loons.  But there<br>
are some things to rememeber:<br>
<p>
1.  Let nanotech and the Singularity be firmly established in everyone's<br>
mind *beforehand*, so that it's the *downside* and not the *whole idea*<br>
that gets thrown out with the loons.<br>
2.  Make sure they're not *violent* apocalyptic loons.  Make sure they<br>
believe that the Singularity is being brought about by God, so they<br>
don't try to stop it, but prepare for the Great Battle against Satan<br>
without sabotaging nanotech labs.  Ensure that they don't try to stop<br>
the Singularity until it's already way too late.  Make sure they're more<br>
talk than action.<br>
3.  Make sure they sound as ridiculous as possible.  Ensure that they<br>
have something to offend everyone who might be tempted to join them.<br>
4.  Give them enough publicity to sabotage everyone else's chances.<br>
