  I would agree that crack isn't an art form though the results may be<br>
enjoyable. I would atribute this to the fact that the role of human<br>
action here is just to get the drug (that's economics), and not in<br>
shaping the experience.  An analogy would be to drive to an ocean.<br>
You provide the steering, the ocean provides the fun. (If you drew<br>
or filmed the ocean, and sculpted the cliffs, it would have been art).<br>
I was trying to draw the art/engineering distinction within the realm<br>
of intentional action, where they both belong.<br>
I wonder if any of these topics have been covered by "real" philosophers.<br>
What are the philosophers doing these days, anyway?<br>
