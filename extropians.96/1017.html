I agree that no idea should be excluded from the free market.<br>
<p>
What attracted me to extropianism (being fairly new here) is its optimism<br>
about, and enthusiasm for, scientific progress.  But I am concerned about<br>
the temptation to "cure" human stupidity on a large-scale through social<br>
engineering.  We need both "smart" ideas and "stupid" ideas on the free<br>
market, because sometimes brilliant solutions evolve out of what at first<br>
seemed ... well, dumb.<br>

Hmmm...  That's certainly not what *I* meant.  It's always going to be up<br>
to intelligent individuals to discern the truth. I may expose the "social<br>
sciences" as a bad idea, I may denounce them personally as a bad idea, but<br>
I would never support banning them.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, I don't claim that what the social sciences study are<br>
illegitimate topics.  (This is my way of apologizing to anyone on this list<br>
who works in the "social sciences" and may have been offended by my<br>
remarks.)  We just need to remember that political philosophy backed by<br>
statistics is still, at bottom, political philosophy.<br>
