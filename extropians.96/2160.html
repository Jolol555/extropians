In a message dated 96-10-19 16:17:20 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Trust me, visit a sweatshop. Nobody likes working <br>
 there. They have no choice. They have no freedom. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Then why do the people who were working in, what an American defined as, a<br>
"sweatshop"  go to work in another one after the first one was closed?  They<br>
had a choice and chose to join another one?  It is because THEY don't define<br>
"sweatshop" the way Americans do.  They resent the "do gooder Americans" for<br>
taking their jobs away.<br>
<p>
The "sweatshop" was paying better than any other job they could find in their<br>
country. <br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;It's not self-serving <br>
to stick up for those who can't be heard, it's not self serving to <br>
protest for human rights. Helping people has gotten a bad name, and by <br>
reducing it's value you hope to destroy any traces of benevolence at <br>
all.  &gt;&gt; <br>
<p>
It IS self-serving when you force other people to be benevolent with you.<br>
 And, that is what is wrong with socialism.  Also "do-gooders" are NOT likely<br>
to know what the "native" really needs.  Take away what you call their<br>
"Sweatshop" (what I call their jobs) and they might starve.  You have<br>
replaced an injustice you saw, for what I see as a greater injustice,<br>
starvation. <br>
<p>
Short term "fixes" of benevolence, just like drug addiction, does the<br>
individual more HARM than good.   Benevolence of the wrong kind addicts<br>
people to the benevolence.   "Give people fish and you feed them for a day.<br>
 Teach them how to fish and you feed them for a lifetime".<br>
