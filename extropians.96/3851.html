<p>
I am in complete agreement.  But letting anyone write any code they feel<br>
like and put it on the server is definitely *not* a way to ensure<br>
compatibility.  Using off-the-shelf technologies is not an issue.  Interface<br>
and API standardization *is*.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Your "3D IRC chatchannel" is a perfect example.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is whats wrong with software such as WorldsChat or WorldsAway is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the chat environments are completely incompatable with each other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Letting everyone build their own software without any type of interface<br>
standardization or control will cause the same problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It will probably require a powerful TCP/IP server engine coupled with a some</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;type of small, fast database engine.  A number of communications and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;interaction APIs will have to be built into the system to allow users to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;build their own (Java?) software modules so that they can add their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;functionality and designs to the world without inadvertently hindering or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;damaging the system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The entire world can then be built on top of this World engine.  What you do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and put in the world is completely up to the user in any fashion the user</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;chooses. The software must be a carefully detailed architecture, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;world does not have to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Stick to evolving VRML standards.</i><br>
<p>
The VRML standards are irrelevant to the above point.  VRML is *not* a<br>
self-operating/self-serving environment.  There is an entire layer of<br>
software between the VRML and the operating system/network.  Normally, this<br>
is an HTTP server, but for our purposes, an HTTP server will probably not be<br>
sufficient.  However, the final product *should* use off the shelf<br>
protocols.  The server-side software will be more complex than an ordinary<br>
HTTP server due to the additional requirements and miscellaneous internal<br>
protocols.  That you can accomplish everything you wish this world to do<br>
with just VRML is wishful thinking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;All the technologies used will be off-the-shelf:  Java, C/C++, TCP/IP, HTML,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;VRML, etc. However, we may be forced to use these technologies in new and</i><br>
<i>&gt;novel ways.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;As I mentioned above, this project will almost surely require a custom</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;server engine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This will not be centralized. It will be ALL OVER the net! Even in personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;FTP sites. People will place their .WLD VRML files on their personal FTP</i><br>
<i>&gt;sites and people will teleport to them using teleporters from other</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhuman/extropian realms. If the # of people accessing these WLD files</i><br>
<i>&gt;grow, we can then move it to a server but by that time, bandwidth will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;faster and data transfer rate per month restrictions for personal websites</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be raised due to faster bandwidth. Remember, USR 56kbps modems over</i><br>
<i>&gt;standard telco lines come out in JAN 97!!</i><br>
<p>
I never claimed that the software was required to be centralized.  In fact,<br>
I am assuming that it isn't.  And besides, you are thinking of distributed<br>
data, not a distributed server.  Distributed data was never an issue because<br>
it doesn't have any impact on the software.  <br>
<p>
The way you are describing this, the world won't be much better than the<br>
Internet already is.  It will be a chaotic hodge-podge of whatever static<br>
material people put in their FTP directories.  There will be little useable<br>
interactive or dynamic content.<br>
<p>
What I want to see personally is a tightly integrated environment that is<br>
everything the Internet wishes it was.  I want to see creative landscapes<br>
and artistic design mixed with person-to-person interaction.  No one should<br>
be restricted from doing what they want, but it should be under the auspices<br>
of a larger plan.  I don't see where these concepts are necessarily mutually<br>
exclusive.  Architecture and design is important if you want this world to<br>
be able to handle more than a dozen simultaneous users.  You can't throw all<br>
the technical and design issues out the window for the sake of convenience.<br>
A chaotic software system is neither scalable nor particularly extensible.<br>
<p>
And just as a note on 56kbps modems:  They won't work with every service<br>
provider.  The modems assume that the ISP is using a PRI telco connection<br>
(which is the case many times) and not one of the myriad of other options.<br>
If the ISP is using a PRI, then the 56kbps modem establishes a 1B quasi-ISDN<br>
connection to the ISP over standard phone lines.  If the ISP uses any other<br>
type of telco connection, you are stuck using the same slow speeds you<br>
always did.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If this project was so simple, someone would have done it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;already.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No because most people don't know how to use VRML tools or have machines</i><br>
<i>&gt;fast enough to run VRML smoothly as well as time and effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If people wanted to learn VRML, they would learn.  VRML can be a little slow<br>
on older systems, but the requirements aren't terribly steep.  Of course,<br>
VRML 2.0 will make the requirements significantly steeper.  Also, some<br>
operating systems are more adept at this type of stuff than others.  Sadly,<br>
some OSs common on older machines (such as DOS/Win3.11) are very poor for<br>
this type of thing.  Win95 works ok though, and a Mac will get you by<br>
(although this is a really poor platform for Java), so a great many should<br>
people should have the minimum development capability.  Putting forth the<br>
effort is a personal problem and not particularly relevant, IMO.<br>
