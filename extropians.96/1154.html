Jeff Dee said:<br>
Or does it simply mean 'acknowledging that there is a degree of <br>
uncertainty in all ideas, and dealing with that rationally'?<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
Close. What I happen to prefer is the kind of mental resilience that <br>
permits one to hold a bunch of truths constant while looking at the <br>
world, remembering from time to time that "certainty" is a state of <br>
mind, not matter. <br>
<p>
The phrase "dealing with that rationally" is one I wouldn't use... <br>
"dealing with that wisely" might be closer to my goal. <br>
Categories are very useful. So is the ability to think outside <br>
the box. <br>
<p>
I think I understand why people get upset with the fuzzy<br>
situational ethicists etc. running the US educational system. I begin <br>
to think that what's happening is rather like the "new math" fiasco <br>
made of the Bourbaki school back in my youth--superficial misleading <br>
"teaching" being done by "teachers" who don't really understand the<br>
material, leaving the students completely clueless about the "why" <br>
and the deep structure.<br>
<p>
Tragic but tough to prevent. I'm reminded of Stephenson's (sp?) <br>
observation in _Diamond Age_ that the children of the first-gen <br>
Vickys didn't come to a decision about social fabric, they were born <br>
into a pattern--so they locked into it like the good little meat <br>
machines they were. (sigh)<br>
