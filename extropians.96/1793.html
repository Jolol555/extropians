The comments about my "eagles and parrots" Churchill quote are winging their<br>
way back around to the "mailing list quality" discussion of a few days ago.<br>
 They raise good points which I think are worth considering regarding the<br>
_purpose_ of the ExList. There seem to be viewpoints on the "list quality"<br>
discussion along two axes: depth vs. breadth and "relevance".  For what it's<br>
worth, on the first, I come down squarely on both sides of the issue, i.e. I<br>
think it's good to think and talk both deeply and widely, as others have<br>
said.  We have a lot of ground to cover if we are to see and understand all<br>
of the complex implications of the basic ideas of transhumanism and<br>
extropianism.<br>
<p>
The "relevance" concern raises a different set of questions.  Is this, as E.<br>
Shaun Russell points out, to be a forum only for "...well thought out,<br>
extropian discussion"?  Certainly all of the comments we've seen lately about<br>
the high volume of traffic on the list and the burden it imposes on busy<br>
people (the kind we want to attract and keep amongst our midst) speak to the<br>
need to keep things focused.  On the other hand the list serves another<br>
purpose, that is as a social center for extropians.  We are a wide-spread<br>
lot, circling the globe.  Even the "Old Ones", concentrated on the Left<br>
Coast, have few enough opportunities to get together face-to-face.<br>
<p>
Private e-mails between members are a good device for developing social<br>
relations that also intersect on the ExList.  I've developed some interesting<br>
relationships this way myself since subscribing.  But the sort of bantering<br>
commentary that has always been a part of the public forum also serves a<br>
valuable purpose, IMHO.  The Extropy Institute should be the seed-bed for<br>
many joint transhumanist enterprises, both cultural and commercial.  Such<br>
enterprises can only happen if people get to know and trust each other fairly<br>
well.  This doesn't happen unless one see a little of the "whole person",<br>
including sometimes seemingly irrelevant details of their biographies and<br>
personalities.  This happens with "small talk".  (Personal Web pages are good<br>
for this, too, and I look forward to the Web member directory that appears to<br>
be one of the upcoming items on the Institute web site, but they don't<br>
include the key element of group interactivity.)<br>
<p>
As technology progresses, the "relevance" tension will sort itself out.<br>
 Within a few years, we'll be gathering socially in rich, common virtual<br>
environments.  I can easily envision an ExI "party room" and more or less<br>
focused social events in virtual environments.  The sort of interpersonal<br>
synergy that will develop in such environments will be wonderful, a real<br>
motor for more substantive developments.  Until then, however, I think that<br>
-- with the use of a little judgment -- we should tolerate the occasional<br>
quip, pun (thank you, Hara Ra, for many a smile) and irrelevant discussion.<br>
