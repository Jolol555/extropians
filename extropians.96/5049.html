The author is guessing, nothing wrong with that but I think he should make it <br>
clear that's what he's doing, he can't even know that's true for the old <br>
fashioned computers we have today. For all we know it's possible to easily <br>
solve NP-complete problems on a single processor conventional computer if you <br>
have the right algorithm; personally I doubt it, but its never been proved to<br>
be impossible. There is an enormous amount of stuff in this area we know <br>
nothing about, we have found some problems that we can prove are at least as <br>
difficult to solve as any NP problem, and we call these NP complete, <br>
but maybe all NP problems are NP-complete, then again maybe not. <br>
<p>
An NP problem is a problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a <br>
nondeterministic Turing machine, a Turing machine that can make a lucky guess. <br>
For example, there probably is not an algorithm that can factor a large number <br>
in polynomial time, but if I was to guess what the factors were, we know for <br>
sure that there is an algorithm to check if I was right or not and do it <br>
polynomial time, so factoring is an NP problem. It is not known if factoring <br>
is an NP-complete problem or not. One of the greatest unsolved problems in <br>
Mathematics is, does P = NP, is there an algorithm that can solve NP problems <br>
in polynomial time?  Most are confident that P is NOT equal to NP, but its <br>
never been proven and if they're wrong then we wouldn't need Quantum <br>
Computers, regular ones would do.<br>

<i>               &gt;exceed this cutoff?") must be practically computable, you               </i><br>
<i>               &gt;have to be able to get at that information. </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
In Shor's factoring algorithm, wrong answers interfere destructively and <br>
correct answers interfere constructively.<br>

<i>                &gt;computer can be built. [...]  If not, then basically  we are                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;stuck with building computers that can only solve a very                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;limited group of problems (be it very quickly), restricting                 </i><br>

Even if a Quantum Computer can never do anything except act as one of <br>
Seth Lloyd's Universal Quantum Simulators  (see August 23 1996 Science) that <br>
alone would be more than enough to change the world thank you very much. <br>
