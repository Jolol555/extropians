Subject: RE: Shooting room paradox<br>

<i>&gt;David Musick and Richard Brodie have said that, if they found themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the shooting room, they would be willing to bet that the dice won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;roll double sixes.  In fact David wants odds in his favor(!).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I wonder if they and others will agree, though, that this is a losing</i><br>
<i>&gt;strategy for most people who follow it. </i><br>
<p>
No matter what the odds, betting against getting shot is always a<br>
winning<br>
stratagy, as you don't have to pay out if you take the bullet.<br>
<p>
P(Death)*Zero + P(Life)*Bet Amount = Expected Payout<br>
<p>
That aside, the "shooting room paradox" and the "doomsday paradox"<br>
are both based on faulty mathamatics. When you examine the<br>
experiment at its point of completion and deduce that 90% of<br>
those involved are in the terminal group, you are not calculating<br>
the odds of a random person who is known to be in *any* experiment<br>
being in the terminal group, but rather, the odds of a person known to<br>
be in a *chosen* experiment being in that final group. By picking the<br>
experiment first, and the choosing the person as if each is equally<br>
probable, you lose any claim that the person is a random selction from<br>
the set of People X Experiments.<br>
<p>
Try it this way (the opposite and equally incorrect paradox):<br>
<p>
Choose the person first (yourself), then, given the information<br>
that you have been selected for the experiment, add up all<br>
the possible experiments that it could be. The one that ends<br>
on this itteration, the next, the next, and so on... Since we<br>
have an infinite number of possible choices, the chance that<br>
the experiment will end this time drops to zero. So we're<br>
garunteed never to get shot or experience doomsday. Hurrah!<br>
