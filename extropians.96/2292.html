It seems to be hard to fry sacred cows here right now - they are <br>
obviously close to extinction :-) <br>
<p>
Of course, a more worrying possibility is that we take them for granted<br>
and don't see them. One way to find out, is to think about the last time <br>
you discussed extropianism with somebody and got angry at their <br>
arguments - sacred cows tend to hide near such sore spots. <br>

I think this is where extropianism shows its true nature. Most other <br>
social or intellectual movements would definitely claim they knew what <br>
they were doing (ask any politician), and would probably not want to try <br>
if they were convinced they didn't. We are living in a culture that is <br>
becoming more and more risk-avoiding every day. <br>
