<i>&gt; If you made one copy of yourself, would the copy work for free?  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; were a copy, would you work for free?  What will keep AI salaries</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater than zero is the fact that they will be (by hypothesis) our equals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they will demand the same things we demand.</i><br>
<p>
The generic AI is not a copy of myself. If I were to make a million<br>
copies<br>
of myself, I'd be in competition with each of them, and by the law of<br>
supply and demand, while I may demand whatever I wish, I'm not going to<br>
actually get that much. because one of those copies will undercut me.<br>
In economic terms, the "clearing cost" will drop to the amount each AI<br>
will<br>
need to sustain itself, since the supply iseffectively infinite. This<br>
subsistence cost will depend on the technology that sustains the AI. I'm<br>
assuming that this ilower than the cost to sustain a human.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you could make a million copies of yourself, how would that differ</i><br>
<i>&gt; from our present situation?  The human race already makes a copy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself, every generation.  Millions of new humans enter the work force</i><br>
<i>&gt; every year.  The supply of entry-level workers is, for most purposes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly unlimited.  Why don't they work for free?   Why do they demand</i><br>
<i>&gt; more compensation, as they move into jobs with more responsiblity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
They start at minimum wage because of the law. We have unemployed<br>
workers<br>
because there are not enough minimum-wage jobs that are cost-effective<br>
to<br>
the employer at minimum wage.<br>
<p>
Workers demand more pay for more responsible jobs because there are<br>
fewer<br>
jobs than workers of this type. Supply and demand.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; If I can create a million copies of myself, how hard would it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to create my own Exxon?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As hard as it is now.  You would still have to (1) conceive the project,</i><br>
<i>&gt; (2) write a detailed business plan, (3) raise capital, (4) hire the copies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; specify their jobs, train them, organize them into an efficient work</i><br>
<i>&gt; force...    Everything you have to do now to create an Exxon</i><br>
<i>&gt; would still have to be done if you were dealing with copies of yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In other words, the situations are isomorphic.</i><br>

<p>
If I had the hardware to support a million copies of myself, I would<br>
organize it to support one of me that's a million times more capable,<br>
if possible.<br>
<p>
It's a truism in computer science that multiprocessing is a lot harder<br>
than<br>
single-processing. depending on the problem, the marginal utility of<br>
additional processors can go negative after only a few processors, or<br>
after<br>
many. This is also true of personnel on a project. A big company does<br>
more<br>
projects. It does not generally do projects faster.<br>
