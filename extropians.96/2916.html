<i>&gt; The reason it took a day and a half for the post to appear is you used</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "::" to prefix your comments. This was the command prefix for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; old extropian mailing list. Since a lot of people still try to send </i><br>
<i>&gt; those commands to the new mailing list, I have all messages that start</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the double colon bounce to me for approval. If you want your </i><br>
<i>&gt; message to show up in a timely manner, use a different quote prefix. </i><br>

Thanks, David.  I think the problem isn't "::" by itself, since I have been <br>
using this as a self-quote prefix for some time.  The problem in this case <br>
is that "::" was the first thing in the file.  That's what set off the<br>
bounce.  <br>
As you say, "I have all messages that *start* with the double colon <br>
bounce to me for approval."  <br>
