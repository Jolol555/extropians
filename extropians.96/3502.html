<i>&gt;THIS IS NOT PHILOSOPHY!</i><br>
<i>&gt;THIS IS MEMETIC ENGINEERING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;*WHAT* DOES IT *TAKE* TO GET THAT *THROUGH* TO YOU PEOPLE!</i><br>
<i>&gt;AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe I'd have better luck asking the "Church of Virus" for help.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe you would.  If you have a reference work on memetic engineering,<br>
please point me to it so I can read and understand and critique<br>
according to those criteria; otherwise, I'll use the ones I have.<br>
<p>
I'll try again from the beginning:<br>
<p>
"Memetic engineering" seems, from where I sit, to be functionally<br>
equivalent to "sales".  So:<br>
<p>
1) Show them they're missing something<br>
2) Show them how wonderful life will be when they get it<br>
3) Show them how what you're selling will get it for them better<br>
   than what anyone else is selling<br>
4) Show them how easy it is for them to get it from you<br>
5) Show them that they had better get it now -- "while supplies last"<br>
and, last but not least:<br>
6) Deliver, lest the counter-meme ("he was selling a bill of goods")<br>
   prevail<br>
<p>
Alternatively, see if you can find a psychological treatise on the<br>
contents of the meme set that Hitler was pushing (which I think<br>
actually fits the outline I presented above, at least loosely).<br>
If you can think of a meme set that was more virulent (or one that<br>
even came close in print, since I am so bold as to presume that you<br>
have neither Hitler's charisma nor his budget), study that one (and<br>
let me know which one you think it is).<br>
<p>
A side note:  A single meme may not be stable enough to work<br>
-- it may take a cohesive meme set.<br>
