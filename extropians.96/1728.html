Well, this depends largely on the task. According to what I have learned<br>
about group psychology, some tasks are very suitable for group-work, while<br>
others aren't. If the task can be subdivided in some way, then the group<br>
members can divide the task between them, and become much more efficient<br>
(this is why we have corporations). Other tasks cannot be subdivided well,<br>
and the group will not be significantly better than the smartest member<br>
(sometimes it will do worse, as ideas are ignored or logistics hinder real<br>
work). In some cases groups can show emergent intelligence such as in<br>
brainstorming or when experts from different specialities get together and<br>
cross-pollinate, but this is hard to organize. <br>

<p>
The big question is: how do we get knowledge instead of information or <br>
(worse) data? <br>
<p>
Case in point: it is becoming harder and harder to find useful <br>
information on the WWW using search engines, since the probability of <br>
finding a short presentation of a subject (very useful) is decreasing as <br>
more and more corporate webpages attract the hits instead (it may be <br>
useful to know that XYZ Corp researches frobnology, but what I need is a <br>
quick overview of what frobnology is about). Maybe we need a special <br>
knowledge search engine that just looks at pages certified to contain <br>
useful information, not just advertisments or spam. <br>
