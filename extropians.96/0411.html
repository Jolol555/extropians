In that case, we should be busy developing new memes rapidly as possible -<br>
but honestly has anyone here ever gotten offended by discussing sex? I can't<br>
imagine that is really true. Raise your hand if you find tallking about it<br>
offensive.<br>
 <br>
I observe that, like emotions, people will tend to view Sex as noncognitive,<br>
or "not an issue" with brain developement ( strange because most primates I<br>
know spend a high perecentage of their brain energy trying to find it or<br>
thinking about it) - A friend of mine returned from a week long conference on<br>
consciousness and cognition and I asked about the topic, what people said<br>
about sex  and what the latest developements were in this arena - I laughed<br>
as it dawned on us that there was not one lecture or booth or comment on it -<br>
apparently this function of the brain is to "low brow" to explore! It was<br>
deleted(or avoided) by the whole contingency. Same with most intellectual<br>
forums  including this list- since i have been on board - til lately. I had<br>
seen PLEASURE 101 on the mail list  and mistaken it for a thread on &gt;H memes<br>
about sex.. but when i opened the files-  it was endless equations about A<br>
not A! What a surprise! math equating &gt;H pleasure - now *that* is integrity<br>
to higher functions of mind/brain.  haha !<br>
<p>
    Sarah had some really interesting ( but not too racey) views on &gt;H<br>
sexuality but then we dropped the thread! But cheers to her for doing it! <br>
Oh well - guess it's one of those  "primate functions " of the body - and we<br>
will evolve out of it anyway - <br>
Hmm - I hope not! : (<br>
