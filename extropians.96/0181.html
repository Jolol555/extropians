        My absurd assertion was to get you and Jamesck tp come up from the<br>
depth for a real discussion of Darwinian Evolution.<br>
<p>
        The (totaly absurd staement) was made to rouse the powers from the<br>
depths. Actually I was hoping for a lot more folks to tell me off.<br>
<p>
        The real matter I want to bring up is whether or not Darwanian Ev.<br>
can account for extant species.<br>
<p>
1. Darwanisn is conservative in the extreme. It favors the production of<br>
organisma who are well adapted to the environment of the parent organism(s)<br>
prior to the point of "conception" or whatever reproduction is fashionable<br>
among that species. It is crtainly not proactive.<br>
<p>
2. There remain questions about the billion wears form the forst organoc<br>
molecules untit th development of relativelt complex single celled organisms<br>
and the development of "interchangable parts" in DNA based organisms.   &lt;<br>
just had an epileptic             seizure and can't complete for a bit, bear<br>
with mee for a bit, I just trying to get real participants to "rise to the bait"<br>
<p>
back soon<br>
                                                                            <br>
                                                                            <br>
                                                                            <br>
