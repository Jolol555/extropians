From: "David Musick" &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; If we become capable of creating universes similar to our own, it seems </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible and likely that another conscious being created our universe.  Just </i><br>
<i>&gt; to make it clear (for the dogmatically intoxicated and mentally impaired): I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt; not saying this being is omnipotent; I'm just saying that it is a conscious </i><br>
<i>&gt; being who is very powerful, powerful enough to create universes.  This being </i><br>
<i>&gt; may have some sort of limited influence over our universe, and as we become </i><br>
<i>&gt; more conscious and intelligent, we may become more adept at interpreting the </i><br>
<i>&gt; signals the being is sending into our universe to influence us (if there is </i><br>
<i>&gt; such a being sending signals).  We may find that following these </i><br>
<i>&gt; "instructions" consistently brings us great progress, and so we would learn to </i><br>
<i>&gt; trust and follow these "instructions".</i><br>
<p>
This reminds me of the arguments by Hans Moravec, developed in more<br>
detail in Frank Tipler's Physics_of_Immortality, that future people will be<br>
able and motivated to create lifelike simulations of the past, and that<br>
therefore we may well be living in such simulations.  In fact Moravec even<br>
argues that since these simulations may be run many times (possibly<br>
infinitely many) while the reality only happens once, that we are much<br>
more likely to be in a simulation than a reality.  You could also argue<br>
that the simulations will cover many possible worlds and not just the one<br>
real world, and therefore for similar reasons our chances of being in a<br>
simulation are greater.<br>
<p>
These models raise the same question about lack of intervention by the<br>
outsiders in the worlds they create.  On the one hand, if they intervene<br>
it messes up the simulation and they may not learn what they wanted to<br>
from it.  But on the other, intervention would provide a new source of<br>
information, and can also be justified on grounds of kindness, as Tipler<br>
does at length.<br>
<p>
I have prayed to the forces that run this universe, but there has been no<br>
response.  On the one hand you have to expect this because at least some<br>
of the time they would run it without intervention; but on the other, you<br>
would also expect that sometimes they would intervene.  Of course they<br>
might intervene in other ways independent of prayer, but I would guess that<br>
moments of prayer would be more likely to receive interventions than others<br>
since that is when attention is being directed towards the outside actors<br>
and so intervention could bring more dramatic results.<br>
<p>
We are faced with the classic dilemma of self-splitting: given that two<br>
events are both going to happen, to different instances of yourself, what<br>
is the proper expectation to hold with regard to your future experiences?<br>
I find it most reasonable to take a probabilistic view, and to expect to<br>
experience the two choices in proportion to the percentage of runs which<br>
will experience one versus the other.  So the lack of perceived intervention<br>
would imply that many more non-intervening runs are made over a given<br>
moment of consciousness than intervening ones.<br>
