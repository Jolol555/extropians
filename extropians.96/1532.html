This "broke" a couple nights ago and it's a quickie.<br>
Basically you only get $1 a person but subscription fees are nothing as<br>
of now (not until the end of October), and with a full matrix that's<br>
$3000!  Free signup, no monthly costs, no money required period until<br>
the beginning of November...so you might as well get cranking with this.<br>
Just send it in and get your ID#.<br>
<p>
DEBT ZAPPER - A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY<br>
Only 250 in as of 10-2-96!!<br>
<p>
The DebtZapper organization is built on a 3 x 7 forced matrix.<br>
It pays $1 for every person in your organization.<br>
With a full matrix that's over $3,000 per month.<br>
There is NO sponsoring required to get paid!<br>
<p>
This is not a get rich quick scheme but a plan that will help the<br>
average person get out of debt quicker and easier than they ever<br>
thought possible at a very low cost.<br>
<p>
The official launch date for DebtZapper is November 1, 1996.<br>
<p>
You have a unique opportunity to get in early and benefit from the<br>
company sponsored advertising that will be used to launch the newsletter.<br>
If each of us will simply use the time between now and the end of<br>
October, using the internet, to find 3 for our first level and help them<br>
do the same we all will make money right from the launch date.<br>
<p>
This is an ideal opportunity to introduce novice mlm'ers to the power of<br>
duplication using the internet.  Can you think of an easier lower cost<br>
way to build a huge group that you can use over and over again?<br>
The opportunities are endless!<br>
<p>
A Webpage is already in the testing stages.  And mass e-mail will be<br>
used to quickly build the organization.<br>
<p>
The cost to subscribe is only $10 per month,<br>
PAY NOTHING NOW TO HOLD YOUR POSITION!!<br>
Your first months dues are not due until the end of October.<br>
<p>
This is truly a ground floor opportunity.<br>
<p>
To subscribe send an e-mail with the information shown below.<br>
You will receive a member number by return email.<br>
<p>
Copy this letter. Revise it to show your member number and place  your<br>
email address on the CC: line. Then, get out to every mlm'er you know<br>
via the internet.<br>
