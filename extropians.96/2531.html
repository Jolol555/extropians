<p>
        Referring to my theory [also a parallel thread running on this<br>
list], I think that both programs would initially be 'you'.  However, once<br>
the machines start running seperately, they begin to have a different<br>
consciousness...or rather, not the same consciousness as the other machine.<br>
To effectively replicate consciousness, initially the consciousness has to<br>
be --again referring to my theory-- reduced into binary form.  Once the<br>
humongous binary snip of consciousness is made and copied repeatedly, it is<br>
then dormant until it is installed and\or loaded.  From the first second<br>
each copy is run, it begins a different stream of consciousness.  For<br>
example, when reduced to binary, it might look like 100011010011010011001010<br>
as opposed to 100011010011010011001011 on the other machine.  Very subtle<br>
difference, but different nonetheless.  This can be because of many things.<br>
If I am applying the 'conscious chip' to an 'android' or mechanical body,<br>
then the initial waking acknowledgements of its wherabouts are going to be<br>
different than the waking acknowledgements of another 'android' with the<br>
same original consciousness.<br>
<p>
        Both programs will think that they are "you", though they will be<br>
different.  Their experiences --and yes, I believe experience is a major<br>
portion of defining consciousness-- will begin to vary right from the moment<br>
they are activated.  Both programs will think that they are "you", and both<br>
programs will be correct, though they are different.  Consider it a form of<br>
budding.<br>
<p>
        Going back to Hal's original paragraph above, I presume that it<br>
would be best to have a modem-like line constantly transfering "your"<br>
consciousness program on to another computer.  This receptive program must<br>
not be activated during this transfer of binary consciousness.  I hope my<br>
response isn't too confusing, sometimes it's hard to find the words I need<br>
to describe my thoughts...semantic thread anyone?  :-)<br>
