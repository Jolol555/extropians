<i>&gt;Pilot is tiny and limited but I could put it in my pocket and forget</i><br>
<i>&gt;about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The question is: if I buy the Newton, will I haul it around, and if I</i><br>
<i>&gt;buy the Pilot, will it do everything I want?</i><br>
<p>
I went through the same dilemma, and decided on the Pilot.  I used one of <br>
the Newton 100's when they first came out, and aside from the terrible <br>
handwriting recognition (which has been substantially improved, I <br>
understand) it was just a little too big to be convenient to carry <br>
everywhere.  There's also a substantial price difference, with the Pilot <br>
1000 costing $250 while the Newton MessagePad 130 starts at around $700, <br>
I believe.  The Newton MessagePad 2000 will probably start at around <br>
$1000.<br>
<p>
I've been using my new Pilot 1000 for the past few days (yes, it was an <br>
Xmas gift) as a replacement for the Day Timer I've carried with me for <br>
the past 3 years, and so far I'm very happy with it.  It fits in my shirt <br>
pocket, so I can easily take it everywhere.  This alone makes it more <br>
convenient and useful for me than the 8.5" x 11" Day Timer, plus I get <br>
all the benefits of a digital device, such as search capabilities and <br>
alarms.  Finally, it comes with a "cradle" which allows me to sync up <br>
with the Pilot Desktop application on my Mac and download new <br>
applications to the Pilot.  It uses the Graffiti handwriting system to <br>
increase the recognition rate, so you have to train yourself to write the <br>
way it wants you to, but most of the characters are intuitive.  I'm <br>
already at the point where I don't have to think about it too much.<br>
<p>
While I would love, like you, to have a device the size of the Pilot that <br>
does everything the Newton does, the unfortunate fact is that such a <br>
device does not yet exist.  The good news is that I'm hearing rumors that <br>
the next generation of the Pilot will have communications capabilities <br>
(which isn't surprising, since it's made by US Robotics).  I only hope <br>
that the first-generation models can be upgraded.  Also, Pilot <br>
applications are written in C and US Robotics seems eager to publish the <br>
Palm OS specs, so in theory there may be more applications as time goes <br>
on.<br>
<p>
One word of advice is to go ahead and purchase the 1MB memory upgrade for <br>
an extra $99.  I've already consumed 33% of the 256K of memory in my <br>
Pilot, and I really haven't entered that much data. At least nowhere near <br>
as much as I expect to...<br>
