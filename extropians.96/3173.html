<p>
That may or may not be the case, depending on the individual.  The only<br>
thing that is certain about a transhuman is that he or she or it will have<br>
gone "beyond" their humanity in a few or in many ways.  To that smaller or<br>
larger extent, they will indeed be non-human, by definition.  Of course,<br>
the other side of the coin is that unless the change has been 100% then<br>
a degree of humanity will remain.  It's not black and white, but fuzzy.<br>
<p>
The other thing that perhaps should be said is that to point a finger<br>
at the non-human part of transhumans (frown implied) is rather speciest,<br>
or at least indicates some intolerance for those transcending their human<br>
limits.  That sits very poorly alongside the self-transformation and<br>
acceptance of diversity that is at the very heart of transhumanism.<br>
