Thanks for your clarifications Eugene. I see that you were not advocating<br>
abolishing sex, you were thinking that it was inevitable for evolutionary<br>
reasons. There's only point I want to address:<br>
<p>

of them <br>

<p>
Rich had suggested I'd misunderstood you, and that you were saying not that<br>
sex would be abolished, but that it would take more subtle and controllable<br>
forms. From your response, it seems that you *were* indeed talking about<br>
abolition. Sex will go because we won't be able to afford the resources.<br>
<p>
This is the point that I find highly unlikely. I agree that many posthumans<br>
may choose to use their computational resources for other things ("sex? --<br>
been there, done that"). However, I seriously doubt this will be due to<br>
Darwinian competition leading to scarce resources. The trend has always been<br>
to effectively *less* scarce resources. As technology continues to develop,<br>
I see no reason to expect that trend to reverse. <br>
<p>
Actually, I can see that *maybe* the first uploads might not be able to<br>
afford to simulate bodies and bodily experiences, though soon that would<br>
become affordable. Even with early uploads, I suspect (but cannot<br>
demonstrate) that simulating much of bodily experience in some form will be<br>
desirable and probably necessary. Psychologically, most people will *want*<br>
to have the experience of bodies when they first upload, even if they later<br>
feel comfortable changing that. (Even they will no doubt avail themselves of<br>
the ability to select which bodily sensations they experience, when, and to<br>
what degree.)<br>
<p>
So, my basic disagreement is with your view that resources will be scarce.<br>
If at all, I see that as plausible only for the first early uploads. I see<br>
computational resources gettting less scarce over time.<br>

P.S. Hey, Eugene, do you know about the conference on the Future of the<br>
Senses in Berlin in January/February? I'll be speaking, as will Hans<br>
Moravec. It would be great to meet you.<br>
