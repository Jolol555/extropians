Part of this is probably crypto-monasticism absorbed from society, but I<br>
think there are justifications for distancing myself from my sex drive.<br>
For one thing, it _is_ a drive.  It would like to run my life.  I have<br>

For God made Ewan Gillies<br>
God gave him wings to fly<br>
But only from the land where he belonged.<br>
But I'd fight with God himself<br>
For the light in Ewan's eye<br>
Or any man who tells me he was wrong.<br>
