I resubscribed to the list just in time to get Hara Ra's October 8 post.<br>
His post should lay to rest any complaints about the quality of the list.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, consider the set of all integers. Some of these will represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; Universe State Strings (USS's). By the rules of QM, each USS can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; converted to another USS. </i><br>
<p>
Ok, another USS...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we confine ourselves to one Feynman interaction per conversion, </i><br>
<i>&gt; then each USS can convert to a finite number of other USS's,</i><br>
<p>
Now we've gone from "another" to "a finite number."  Are you sure <br>
there will be more than one?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  One way to visualise this is to imagine a line or grid of dots </i><br>
<i>&gt;  representing the integers...   The integers which represent</i><br>
<i>&gt;  possible USS's are marked in some way (say red dots). </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Each red dot has lines running to other USS's, each line representing </i><br>
<i>&gt;  an allowed QM interaction. </i><br>
<p>
Ok, so there are lines, plural; and... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Note that each red dot also has INCOMING lines,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  representing the set of possible ancestor USS's.</i><br>
<p>
Again there are lines, plural.  But is this necessary?   <br>
<p>
Imagine a grid of dots, some red, some "off".  The red ones represent <br>
possible states of the universe, the others represent impossible states.  <br>
What if you take a point in the latter group, one of the "off" points:  <br>
   Does the concept "Feynman interaction" still apply to it?  <br>
   Does it too have lines leading to other points?  <br>
   If so, do all its lines lead to other "off" points, or could some of them <br>
      lead to red points?  <br>
   In other words, could you have a situation where each red point <br>
      has more than one line leading into it, but only one of those <br>
      incoming lines comes from another red point?   <br>
<p>
Suppose each red point does have more than one line leading out, <br>
toward other points.  Does it follow that each red point has more than <br>
one line leading into it?  No!  Consider:   <br>
<p>
Let the integers be represented by points on a line.  Suppose numbers <br>
divisible by three are red:  3, 6, 9, 12, etc.  All other numbers are "off."  <br>
Suppose each point n has two lines leading out, one going to 3n + 1, <br>
the other going to 3n + 2.  <br>
   Each point has two outgoing lines.  <br>
   Each point has at most one incoming line.<br>
   Red points have no incoming lines.  <br>
<p>
Of course this universe would die out quickly; I'm just using it as an <br>
example to show that it is possible to have more than one line leading <br>
out of each point, without having more than one (or any!) leading into <br>
the red points.  <br>
<p>
So, your conclusion, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  One point to notice here is that every state of the Universe </i><br>
<i>&gt;  comes from a large and finite number of possible past states, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  that there is NO single past.  </i><br>
<p>
is far from obvious, at least to me.  Maybe I'm missing something.  <br>
I hope so, because <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; MIracles require absolute forgetfulness.  </i><br>
<p>
is too beautiful not to be true.  <br>
<p>
[PS  Nadia, are you with us on this thread?  Imagining grids of points,     <br>
and having them light up in various patterns and colors, is the <br>
connection between art and mathematics.  Mathematics, when you learn <br>
to see it as it is, is like a laser show in a cathedral full of mirrors.]  <br>
