<i>&gt;&gt;Selling well doesn't qualify music as "quality".  I cringe when I think</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;as do i... but i've learned to live with it ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I was defining</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"quality" in a technical sense.  I would submit that on a technical level</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(musically), that Ace of Base is a very average band in its genre with few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;outstanding features.  I recognize that some of the music *I* like is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;technically mediocre, and am fine with that.  But I won't ever claim that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is "quality" or "great" music simply because I like it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think there are more approaches than just the 'musically technical' for</i><br>
<i>&gt;how to define 'quality' music, innovation, experimentalism or just stuff</i><br>
<i>&gt;that works, on a musical structure level, on an originality of sound level</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc.. Some of the music you like, i would define as quality music, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;though i wouldn't on a technical level. There's also a degree of relativity</i><br>
<i>&gt;in judging music 'Ace of Base' was not only sold to a specifically dance</i><br>
<i>&gt;music audience, to such an audience this music may have been very original,</i><br>
<i>&gt;experimental and innovative. Look at it this way: Nitzer ebb is considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;innovative by those who never heared of DAF... 'Quality' is a very relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;and personal term. As to ace of base not being of superior quality, musical</i><br>
<i>&gt;technically, i think most people will agree on that. But then again, i know</i><br>
<i>&gt;a lot of musical technically high 'quality' music that lacks that quality in</i><br>
<i>&gt;many other ways...      </i><br>
<p>
I believe we are generally in agreement.  Our perspectives a little a<br>
different, but the end result is the same.<br>
