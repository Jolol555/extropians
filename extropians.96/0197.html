<p>
This is only true for people who seek to find the meaning of their life at<br>
the end of vast time, instead of just opening their eyes to the world<br>
around them and finding the meaning of their life in what they are<br>
experiencing and what they can do to improve the immediate quality of their<br>
lives and the lives of the people around them. I'm not slamming big hopes,<br>
big dreams, big ambitions! These are wonderful things. But they are far too<br>
uncertain to be reliable foundations for all our other values. I think<br>
people benefit from connecting their values as closely as possible to the<br>
immediate reality in which they live.<br>
<p>
I've read Lerner's book, and like you, I was disappointed by the lack of<br>
economic sophistication revealed in his value-analyses. But I was also<br>
disappointed by his buying into the traditional Western<br>
theological-cosmological quest to find the ultimate basis for values as far<br>
away as possible from the world of everyday experience. And further, I was<br>
a little bit disappointed in that the whole book just seemed to be a<br>
premeditated attack, an axe-grinding exercise with a preconceived<br>
conclusion, a holy war or a mission from God.<br>
<p>
But I wasn't too disappointed with that last bit, because it'd be hard to<br>
take away that aspect of the book without taking away what I liked about<br>
it. What I liked about the book is that it identified an emerging<br>
orthodoxy, a new superstition (the sort of thing you see in Tipler's work,<br>
which I haven't read yet and so cannot really criticize and shouldn't even<br>
mention, I suppose) developing out of the unquestioning acceptance of a<br>
highly speculative theory. Lerner might have come to write this book after<br>
looking around as hard as he could for an example of a developing<br>
superstition, an unquestioned orthodoxy for the next few decades, and<br>
trying to nip it in the bud. And if this last was truly his motivation,<br>
then I can't fault him at all.<br>
<p>
If I were an astrophysicist or a cosmologist, I'd worry about the ultimate<br>
destiny of the universe, because that would be part of my job. But I'm not,<br>
so I'll worry about it in a few hundred years, maybe. Sooner, if I manage<br>
to clear away all the other stuff I'm interested in.<br>
