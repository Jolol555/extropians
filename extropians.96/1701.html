In a message dated 96-10-03 16:00:28 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Business assumes that the workers aren`t competent to run a business by <br>
 themselves. I`m a big advocate of co-ops.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
What Co-Ops are as successful as the Fortune 500 (or is it Fortune 100?)<br>
Co-Op Wisconsin Dairies?  Do you think they are run by "workers"?   They have<br>
professionally trained managers.  They may be former farmers, but they all<br>
have degrees now.  <br>
<p>
My point is some "workers" ARE competent, some are not.  The same for<br>
managers.   But managers have more education.   A negotiation point for them.<br>
 <br>
<p>
BTW Do you think management doesn't "work" too?  They sometimes don't even<br>
get more money because they are on salary and get no overtime.   Yet, they<br>
work overtime too.  The manager salary range is lower than a "poor worker"<br>
with overtime.  For the truck divers the sky's the limit with overtime.  Why?<br>
 Negotiation not unions.   They have something to sell and salary negotiation<br>
is affected in their favor.   <br>
<p>
If businesses are so greedy why aren't they paying ALL of us minimum wage?<br>
 Negotiation.  If you have nothing worth buying, you have a negotiation<br>
problem.<br>
