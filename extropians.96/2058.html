Suresh Naidu asks, "why should someone be able to force others to work for <br>
them, by offering them the "choice", between starvation and slavery."<br>
<p>
Well, let's analyze your question, and the answer will be fairly obvious.  If <br>
someone only has the option of starving, which isn't much of a choice at all <br>
and someone else comes in to offer them the option of working like a slave and <br>
living rather than starving and dying; now the person has a choice; before <br>
they were going to starve anyway; that was their only option.  But now they <br>
have a way out of that; they can work like a slave rather than starve.  Then, <br>
maybe they'll look for opportunities to increase their standard of living even <br>
further.  They are making progress.... it used to be that they would just <br>
starve, now they at least have people giving them the option of working very <br>
hard and living rather than painfully starving and dying.  And maybe as they <br>
work and get a little more skilled and a little more educated, they'll become <br>
smart enough and skilled enough to figure out how to take care of themselves a <br>
little better and maintain their own existence, by their own work.<br>
<p>
This is all about the education of Humanity.  The whole world is the learning <br>
place of Humanity, and through trial and error and just playing around, we are <br>
learning how to take care of ourselves better and become more successful at <br>
fulfilling our desires.  Adult humans in the world are really not much <br>
different from children playing on their school playground.  People need to be <br>
educated and learn how to take care of themselves.  This is the highest form <br>
of charity: to educate someone to be capable of achieving their own desires, <br>
through their own intelligence and skill.<br>
<p>
The problems of the world are mostly caused out of human ingnorance and <br>
stupididy.  Most people don't really know how to take care of themselves <br>
competantly.  They haven't figured out how to secure a reliable food source <br>
very well.  They haven't figured out how to shelter themselves very well, and <br>
they haven't figured out how to educate themselves and each other very well.  <br>
Their basic problem is that they are uneducated, in the sense that they don't <br>
know how to adequately take care of themselves.  If the poor people had the <br>
knowledge and skills that the rich people have developed in rich countries, <br>
then they could build their own cities and their own factories and become rich <br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
But how can they be educated in that?  They need experience in running complex <br>
orgnizations and machines.  They need to work in these business places, so <br>
they can understand how to run one themselves.<br>
<p>
This is why I support the "sweat-shops" in poor countries.  Yes, the people <br>
have pretty bleak options: either work like a slave, or starve.  But, at least <br>
they have the option of not starving now, rather than just starving by <br>
default.  The "sweat-shops" give the people the option of not starving; <br>
without the "sweat-shops", the people would just starve as the natural result <br>
of not having enough food.  Now they have the option of securing food rather <br>
than starving, but they have to work really hard to secure that food.  As they <br>
become more skilled and more productive, they will be able to secure food more <br>
easily, without having to work so much any more.  Then they can use their work <br>
and creativity to find ways to satisfy their other desires, now that they have <br>
satisfied their desire for a secure food supply.  It takes time; it's a long <br>
learning process.  The western culture has spent thousands of years figuring <br>
it out.  It's taken a long time and a lot of education for the Western culture <br>
to learn how to take care of itself so well.  It's going to take a while to <br>
transmit our knowledge to other cultures, so they can gain the knowledge and <br>
skills required to take care of themselves better, so that they can create <br>
more opportunities for themselves, so they no longer have only the option of <br>
starving, they have many options for everyone, like our culture does.<br>
<p>
"Sweat-shop 101" is one of the introductory courses in the University of <br>
Capitalism.  The students start out as starving, miserable people, and they <br>
learn the basics of hard work, with the resulting benefit of being able to <br>
live.<br>
<p>
Then the students move into a higher level class, when they are ready.  Then <br>
some of them use their skills to work at other jobs that require more skill <br>
and are more productive.  Then they can spend less time working and be more <br>
productive in that time, as they become more efficient and intelligent.  It's <br>
a very large educational process; that is basically what Capitalism is, an <br>
educational process.  We are learning how to take care of ourselves and <br>
satisfy our desires more effectively.  Capitalism is a very good teacher, <br>
because it keeps adjusting itself to the needs of the students as each person <br>
is only given tasks they can handle, and if the student wants more, they must <br>
discipline their minds more fully to become more competant in satisfying their <br>
desires.  If the students want to learn how to run large, complex, <br>
self-maintaining organizations, such as a business, they can start their own <br>
business, if they have learned the preliminary material to starting one's own <br>
business, which include knowing how businesses operate, which includes working <br>
for a business.  If they are capable of maintaining a business then that <br>
becomes apparant to them as they bring money in (money represents the means to <br>
fulfull one's desires),  If they are not capable of carrying out their <br>
business, they will have learned some important lessons in the process of <br>
trying, and they can try again, in a modified way, and keep trying until they <br>
have mastered the business of taking care of themselves and satisfying their <br>
own desires.<br>
<p>
These poor countries are learning, and going from the starvation stage to the <br>
wealthy stage often requires going through the "sweat-shop" phase.  Once the <br>
people on earth are educated beyond the "sweat-shop" phase, "sweat-shops" <br>
won't exist any more.  If the people were more educated and capable, they <br>
wouldn't have to rely on someone who offers only horrible working conditions; <br>
they will be able to take care of themselves.  But the education must be <br>
allowed to run it's course; don't expect any over-night miracles; the poor are <br>
all becoming wealthier than they were.  There is a reason some people are rich <br>
while others are poor; it is because the poor haven't learned how to take care <br>
of themselves as well as the rich have (in general, but there are exceptions)<br>
<p>
If you really want to help the poor, educate them.  Private property is a <br>
fiction, used by the University of Capitalism to help develop responsibility <br>
in its students.  The students must learn how to manage their own property.  <br>
The notion of private property seems like a very good learning tool, because <br>
people seem naturally inclined to want to own things, and are thus motivated <br>
to increase their skills and intelligence to aquire even more that they find <br>
of value.  It is a good tool for motivating people to progress.<br>
<p>
Capitalism is a community education program, working on a very large scale.  <br>
To succeed in Capitalism, you must keep increasing your level of skill and <br>
discipline; that is the nature of the game.  And it is a game.  The <br>
free-market system is all a big game; it is a game designed to build mental <br>
and physical discipline.  To play the game well, you must keep improving <br>
yourself, and people seem naturally inclined to fulfill their own desires, <br>
which is what playing the game teaches you to do.<br>
<p>
If you wish to make changes to this fine educational facility, please direct <br>
your comments to the Administration of the University of Capitalism, the <br>
people who choose what gets bought and what doesn't, the consumers, the common <br>
people, everyone.  If they all wish to change and follow your plan, then that <br>
is their choice, and that is what will happen, but tell the Administration <br>
about it and let them make their choice, whether to buy your idea or not.  But <br>
don't try to force people to use your ideas when they don't want to.  If you <br>
want people to be giving and hard-working for the benefit of the community, <br>
then present your ideas to people about how to do this and the rewards from <br>
doing this.  If they like your idea, they'll implement it.  <br>
<p>
So, use persuasion to get your ideas enacted, not coercion; let people decide <br>
for themselves how they will live their own lives and what games they play.  <br>
Anarchy is not about forcing other people to stop being coercive, it's about <br>
educating people so they understand the destructive consequences of coervice <br>
behavior and then choose *of their own free will* to stop living a coercive <br>
and destructive life.<br>
