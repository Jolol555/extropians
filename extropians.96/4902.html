Here is another question I have been unable to answer through my own<br>
experience, so maybe someone on the list can give me insight.<br>
<p>
Many religions have been propagated through force of the sword.  In many<br>
cases this proved to be an effective technique.  If religion is such a<br>
profoundly intertwined aspect of a person's being, how were so many<br>
countries and regions "converted" permanently and effectively simply by<br>
force, even if occupation was relatively transient?  This seems to be<br>
inconsistent with the supposed nature of religion.<br>
