<i>&gt;When I was 20 I took mescaline.  I only took a small amount, not </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough for a full-fledged psychedelic trip.  But I did feel some effect.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;When I was 21 I took one more standardized test, given by the army.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;(This was during the Vietnam war; they tested us to see if we were </i><br>
<i>&gt;draftable.)  I scored in the 94th percentile on that one.  About the same </i><br>
<i>&gt;time, my grades started slipping.  Lyle, the straight-A student from   </i><br>
<i>&gt;day one, had lost his edge.  </i><br>
<p>
I had the same experience, at about the same age (21-22), but without<br>
the drugs.  I'm 30 now, and am not nearly "as smart" as I was when I<br>
was 20.  The main effect has been concentration: I used to be able to<br>
concentrate for hours at a shot.  Now, while I'm not a poster-fella<br>
for ADD, I sure can't.  I can't even concentrate for 5 minutes any<br>
more.  I've been thinking that taking up meditation (and stopping<br>
reading so much email!) might be a cure.<br>
<p>
It may not have been the drugs, Lyle.<br>
