Eric Watt Forste wrote 10/1/96: &lt;We are long past the time for pre-emptive<br>
strikes, Reilly.&gt;<br>
<p>
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Keep the demographic levels of<br>
servility low, and the fight against authoritarian violence is manageable.  With<br>
high levels of servility, and a looming World State, the fight against<br>
authoritarian violence is unmanageable.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Since toleration of entropy is ruination...&gt;<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;I am uncomfortable with the broad sweep of your generalization. I would<br>
say that toleration of nonconsensual violence and expropriation is ruination.&gt;<br>
<p>
My axiom ranges beyond the narrowly political issues you have identified.  It is<br>
more in the nature of a biophysical law.<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;I get a funny feeling participating in this discussion. Is there anyone on<br>
this list who could reasonably be accused of being servile? Thought not.  Why<br>
are we discussing this? Reilly, if you want to crush the servility meme, you are<br>
preaching to the choir here.&gt;<br>
<p>
Several individuals have told me that it is useful for them to print a hardcopy<br>
of the posts I make similar to this one.  The arguments contained in them, are<br>
richly contextual, a fabric, if you will.  There is a Gestalt quality about<br>
them, that is lost when one is in the usual Net mode of chopped-up thinking in<br>
disjointed paragraphs.  The "topsight," in Gelernter's terminology, is that an<br>
intractable problem in achieving minimal government exists.  Discussion of<br>
servility comes into play in fleshing out this problem.  This is of vital<br>
interest to the list, unless, of course, the list consists of irrational<br>
utopians who just want to pretend these dynamic relationships don't exist, or<br>
that there's some magic technological fix to them.  I don't believe that to be<br>
the case.<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;People learn to govern themselves by being expected to govern themselves,<br>
preferably by their parents, from earliest childhood.&gt; and &lt;I say people who are<br>
consistently expected to govern themselves learn how to do so and usually do a<br>
pretty good job.  People who are consistently expected to submit to authority<br>
can never learn how to govern themselves except through luck and canniness.&gt; and<br>
&lt;Interestingly, I think this is the first point in my conversations with you in<br>
which Nietzsche takes your side of the question and not mine.&gt;<br>
<p>
Go with Nietzsche on this one. &lt;g&gt; You are trying to use smoke and mirrors to<br>
avoid the necessity of legitimate levels of hierarchy in human society.  To<br>
strip away the smoke and mirrors, you must examine with great honesty and<br>
clarity what the mechanisms of what you term "expected" are.<br>
<p>
Parents today, even when they believe in their own authority, which is a rarity<br>
in our post-60s Stalinized culture, aren't allowed by the state to exercise it.<br>
Nor are there "consistent" expectations either in one's childhood or in one's<br>
adulthood, because humanity is inconsistent by nature during periods of rapid<br>
technological development.  The state stands behind every family, ready to<br>
intercede "on a child's behalf" whenever the child complains about much of<br>
anything, whether the complaint is issued in the neighborhood, the grocery<br>
store, the doctor's office, or the school.  The children know this from very<br>
early on, it permeates the air.  When the child says "I won't do what you expect<br>
me to do, and you can't make me," the child is 100% right.  Self-control cannot<br>
arise unless the child somewhere along the way makes an internal decision to<br>
submit to authority.  It doesn't have to be slavish non-stop submission, no need<br>
to make a big bugaboo about it, but it does have to occur when it counts.<br>
<p>
Look closely at what differences there are between "You are expected to do<br>
this," and "You will do this."  If expectation means you can always walk away,<br>
without ever having to obey, then self-governance cannot arise.  Children can<br>
only decide to obey internally, when they are trapped by the legitimate<br>
hierarchy of society, which closes off avenues of disobedience to them.  But in<br>
the modern welfare state, there are never right and wrong decisions which are<br>
rewarded and punished by the next immediate level of authority, there are only<br>
cases to be dealt with by impersonal, removed, statist bureaucrats and<br>
therapists.  There can be no self-control, no respect of others, no dignity<br>
between individuals, without this internal decision occurring.  And with the<br>
dual scourges of nihilism and radical egalitarianism running rampant in Western<br>
Civilization, there in fact, is precious little self-control, respect, or<br>
dignity.  A steady diet of *only* positive reinforcement and *only* unearned<br>
self-esteem boosting in the public schools, with no external discipline, only<br>
produces infantile behavior, individuals simply rage when their desires are<br>
thwarted.  As Pope defined servility, they are "proud, selfish and dull."  In<br>
addition, as Nietzsche noted, you simply cannot learn to command effectively<br>
unless you have learned to obey.  That is why we have no leadership today to<br>
speak of, no Madisons, no Washingtons.<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;The world is full of authoritarian violence, and the last really big wave<br>
of it only ended some fifty years ago.&gt;<br>
<p>
IMO, it ended only seven years ago, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, if you<br>
don't count Red China, North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan,<br>
Libya, Syria and assorted other third-world hellholes.  I might include the<br>
authoritarian "violence on a grand scale" behind the metaphorical Berlin Wall<br>
known as tenure, protecting the socialist radicals ensconced in the higher<br>
education gulags as they wreak havoc on their students with scientific nihilism,<br>
cultural relativism and historical revisionism.<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;Currently, more than 50% of the product of the US economy is being<br>
poured down a rathole. You know what a tiny sliver of that money, left to<br>
be spent consensually by individuals to further their own values, could do<br>
for life-extension and space-industrialization research.  This is violence<br>
on a grand scale.&gt;<br>
<p>
Now wait a minute.  You accused me of "preaching to the choir"?  Let's be<br>
consistent here!  &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;This is one reason why I'm more concerned about getting the government out<br>
of the education business than I am about changing the lifestyles of my hippie<br>
neighbors.&gt;<br>
<p>
I wonder if such noble toleration would apply, if your neighbors were, as you<br>
refer to them, "such scum as Bill Dole and Bob Clinton"?<br>
<p>
Now look, you egregiously flame me with such obvious hyperbole and<br>
fear-mongering as:<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;...when I see you eagerly whipping up an orgy of rigidity, intolerance,<br>
internal censorship of thought, and various other things which are Not To My<br>
Taste, I'm going to speak against it.&gt;<br>
<p>
Then you turn around and refer to the two rivals for the leadership of the Free<br>
World as "scum."  You can't find one iota of support from my post that would<br>
justify your use of hate-speech like "whipping up an orgy" against me.  My post<br>
was measured and reasonable, a coherent logical construction.  Your hatred for<br>
our country's leadership is far more filled with rigidity and intolerance than<br>
anything I wrote.  So calm down, take a deep breath, and don't throw stones in<br>
my direction until you move out of your own glass house.<br>
