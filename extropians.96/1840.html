This would only buy you a little time.  You really need to advance<br>
your tech as fast as possible.   Anyway, the point is if competition<br>
were this fierce, it would soon be visible, so that can't be what is<br>
going on out there now.<br>

That could be a show stopper for any strategy, it doesn't imply that<br>
this isn't the best strategy.  And if such pulses had an arbitrary<br>
radius, that would be the end of the living universe.<br>
