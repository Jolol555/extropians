Didn't the Manhattan project adopt a similar attitude? I seem to remember<br>
reading that they calculated the probability of the first nuclear explosion<br>
causing a chain reaction which would destroy the entire atmosphere. The<br>

I read could have found exaggeration through the ethics of its writer.)<br>
