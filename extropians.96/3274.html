<i>&gt;Now this doesnt mean that you should freeload or we need to abandon the</i><br>
<i>&gt;notion that trading and exchange should and can be beneficial to both</i><br>
<i>&gt;parties, but the negativity behind these little sayings can be</i><br>
subconsciously<br>
<i>&gt;daunting.</i><br>
<p>
PAUL:<br>
<i>&gt;I think that you have missed the whole point of TANSTAAFL. </i><br>
<p>
Q:<br>
..if you read the first lines above...I dint miss it, I <br>
sideswiped it ; - )<br>
I think "sayings" like this, used in interpersonal <br>
relationships,  even if meaningful in the beginning, <br>
soon become overshadowed by the nearsightedness of<br>
*this useful business equation*. In PRINCIPLE, this homily <br>
is useful, in PRACTISE  ( IMHO) it leaves out a lot of<br>
wonderful scenarios, including feelings, not paid for <br>
or bought.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Its purpose (an</i><br>
excellent one to my mind) is to remind us all that, one way or another, we DO<br>
always earn and pay for everything we get. In the above example you have<br>
prepaid (or earned) your "free" lunches and dinners by educating and refining<br>
<i>&gt;the quality and appeal of the person you are. </i><br>
<p>
Maybe so, in YOUR eyes, But I would be highly insulted <br>
if you offered me the money for dinner instead of free<br>
food, and the "exchange" (if any) sure ain't the cost of the<br>
food, ( I can buy my own, thank U) it's your company!<br>
So therefore I agree with the next :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In addition, there is involved</i><br>
here different kinds of value, some monetary and some non-monetary<br>
(spiritual?). So there is really no question of needing to abandon the ideas<br>
of<br>
trade to mutual advantage even in this context. A wider question which I<br>
would<br>
like to see discussed in a thread (maybe is has been before, I am new to the<br>
list) would be whether all of a person's values are even commensurable (and<br>
therefore can be evaluated in terms of money).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Is it ever useful to equate all of our dealings, no matter <br>
how delicate , with the business venture? It is certainly<br>
SAFE, and comfortable, and capitalism is a very rewarding game, one I admire<br>
and aspire to. But I leave the<br>
boardroom out of the bedroom and out of my close<br>
friendships.<br>
<p>
And, I think a  lot of people use sayings like this <br>
incorrectly to excuse bad behavior or fear of letting<br>
other people in to their hearts.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, all "truisms" lose meaning out of or in certain context.<br>
