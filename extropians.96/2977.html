<i>&gt;        Indeed.  I think we should have a definition of 'atheist'.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;consider myself an atheist because I don't believe in a conventional  'God'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am very open to other thoughts however, and the general term of</i><br>
<i>&gt;atheist has a synonym of 'closed-minded'.  Go figure.</i><br>
<p>
Theists claim to know there are one or more gods.  Atheists claim to<br>
know there are none.  I call myself an agnostic because I claim I<br>
don't know, and a doctrinaire agnostic because I claim that nobody<br>
else can possiblyknow either.  But my anti-dogma dogma has its limits.<br>
<p>
I spent about 15 minutes Tuesday trying to convince a neoPagan New-Age<br>
                                                   * * * *<br>
theist that she hadn't necessarily discovered the * TRUTH * in her 8<br>
                                                   * * * *<br>
years of meditation, when it dawned on me that 1) we could go on like this<br>
indefinitely and only raise our blood pressure, and 2) as long as I didn't<br>
make an ego battle of it, what she _thought_ didn't matter as much to the<br>
quality of my life as what she _did_.  When that light went on, I said,<br>
"Now that you know all that, what will you do?", and she said (loosely) "My<br>
life's work is now to work with the Habitat for Humanity helping homeless<br>
families build homes for themselves.".  Suits me fine, cosmology or no<br>
cosmology.  We parted amicably.  So I guess I'm a pragmatic agnostic as well.<br>
