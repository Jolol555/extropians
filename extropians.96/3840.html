In a general atmosphere of candor, those skulking will quickly attract<br>
attention from the masses of bright citizens, including whistle blowers in<br>
abundance.  We would swarm all over them with our amateur snoop programs<br>
and rRadio Shack mosquito cameras.  The Mafia wouldn't stand a chance.<br>
<p>
Note: Hal does not comment on the historical fact that freedom directly<br>
correlates with just one thing -- the power of people to deny shadows to<br>
monsters.<br>
<p>
Instead, he advocates that we enter a huge, dangerous experiment,<br>
encouraging people to cold-shoulder each other and wear habitual masks,<br>
though he can cite no examples of his prescription working on a large scale<br>
in any human society.<br>
