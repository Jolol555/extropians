Kathryn quotes Bart Kosko:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	"All facts were matters of degree.  The facts were always</i><br>
<i>&gt;	fuzzy or vague or inexact to some degree. Only math was</i><br>
<i>&gt;	black and white and it was just an artificial system of </i><br>
<i>&gt;	rules and symbols.  Science treated the grey or fuzzy facts</i><br>
<i>&gt;	as if they were the black/white facts of math.  Yet no one</i><br>
<i>&gt;	had put forth a single fact about the world that was 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt;	true or 100% false.  They just said they all were."</i><br>
<p>
Aargh, this begs to be taken apart!  :)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;"All facts were matters of degree.  The facts were always</i><br>
<i>&gt;fuzzy or vague or inexact to some degree.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is a very popular stance in today's US scholar establishment,<br>
and it is also total semantic hogwash.  According to Webster:<br>
<p>
fact \'fakt\ n [L factum, fr. neut. of factus, pp. of facere]<br>
1: a thing done : as 1a: CRIME {accessory after the ~} obs<br>
1b: FEAT archaic 1c: ACTION archaic<br>
2: PERFORMANCE, DOING<br>
3: the quality of being actual : ACTUALITY<br>
4a: something that has actual existence 4b: an actual occurrence : EVENT<br>
5: a piece of information presented as having objective reality<br>
<p>
Read this carefully.  There are *no* fuzzy facts.  Instead, fuzziness<br>
itself may be a fact of measurement or observation.  Vagueness means<br>
lack of knowledge.  Inexactness means extensive knowledge about the<br>
scope of applicability of facts.  Truthfulness is yet another attribute,<br>
the most relevant of all mentioned to the word "fact."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Only math was</i><br>
<i>&gt;black and white and it was just an artificial system of </i><br>
<i>&gt;rules and symbols.</i><br>
<p>
Artificial?  Oh, please!  Is a rock more fundamental than number 1?<br>
<p>
There is nothing "black" or "white" about mathematics, although it<br>
*is* a system of rules and symbols, and a very successful one for<br>
modelling fuzziness among other things.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Science treated the grey or fuzzy facts</i><br>
<i>&gt;as if they were the black/white facts of math.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, yes?  So I must be out of this world since I'm spending months<br>
studying errors of measurement in order to publish a paper about some<br>
facts I measured in less than a week?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yet no one</i><br>
<i>&gt;had put forth a single fact about the world that was 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt;true or 100% false.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, let's see:  the world exists?  Sounds pretty 100%-ish to me,<br>
for all practical purposes.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;They just said they all were.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, now we get to the bottom: context, context!<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
