IAN: Perhaps you know they did but are only joking. ?? <br>
Assuming you do not know: in fact Mexican tribes, such <br>
as the Mazatecs, consumed, as a central feature of reli-<br>
gious ritual and healing ceremony, the seeds of two varieties <br>
of the morning glory, ipomoea violacea and rivea corymobosa, <br>
from which Dr. Albert Hoffman extracted LSD. But before you <br>
go out and wolf down a packet of morning glory seeds  %^)  <br>
consider that most are coated with a toxic fungicide. <br>
Also, I suspect they don't sell the active varieties. |^(<br>
<p>
LSD was originally extracted by Dr. Hoffman from the <br>
rye fungus ergot (claviceps purpurea) from which several <br>
popular medications are derived, such as the life exten-<br>
sion drug Hydergine. Here too, in the case of rye fungus, <br>
there is evidence of ceremonial religious use when prop-<br>
erly prepared, as the fungi is quite poisonous.<br>
<p>
Hawaiian wood rose also contains LSD, as I understand,<br>
in fairly high concentrations. It's even sold through<br>
mail order companies. I'm, however, not aware of it<br>
being associated with historical ritual use.<br>

<i> &gt;But in essence (with or without mushrooms) you are talking about something</i><br>

<p>
IAN: It's interesting to note that the anti-drug mind-set, <br>
which acts to suppress the logical integration of hallucinogenic<br>
knowledge and practice into modern life and anthropo-neurological<br>
investigation, cannot see the connections that make this line of <br>
inquiry logical.  In short, the lower intellectual capacity of <br>
this violent subset of society suppresses the application of <br>
those agents that may be associated with the growth of intellect-<br>
ual capacity, which is exactly what one would predict. The drug <br>
laws represent the victory of ignorance which stifles further <br>
intellectual progress and evolution along these lines.<br>
