Robin, could you please explain your concept of "upload"? Mine is<br>
perhaps a bit vague. I've always thought of an "upload" as the digital<br>
continuation of a "meat" personality. With this definition, I don't<br>
see how uploads are produced more rapidly than "meat" humans. I also<br>
think of an upload as using less physical resources than a "meat" human,<br>
not more.<br>
<p>
Now, if you want to talk about machine-based intelligence in general, I<br>
don't see a real difference in resource use between a society of<br>
replicating<br>
uploads and any other machine-based intelligence.I've always assumed<br>
that<br>
any machine-based intelligence, however internally constituted, could<br>
expand nearly instantly to occupy the entiore available computer<br>
resource, and<br>
could shortly thereafter convert the rest of the available mass into<br>
additional computer resource.<br>
