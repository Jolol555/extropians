"The Powers are beyond our ability to comprehend.  Get the picture?"<br>
<p>
No.  I don't.  It's possible, but I've seen nothing to indicate that<br>
belief in Powers capable of thought we are intrinsically incapable of<br>
understanding, Power capable of "solving the First Cause", is anything<br>
more than religious faith.<br>
<p>
Here's what "Perceptual Transcends" mean to me.  There's a picture in<br>
_GEB_ of all truths (or theorems) and those which are recursively<br>
enumerable, if I remember my terms correctly.  The former is a square<br>
containing the latter represented as a fractal tree.  If that tree is<br>
all of human knowledge, everything we have learned through millenia of<br>
trial and error, and a newborn Power has every branch of that tree as an<br>
obvious primitive, it is still inside the square.  It can more quickly<br>
explore several more fractal branch-layers of truth, but all those<br>
truths could well be still comprehensible to a broad-minded human with<br>
enough time and desire to learn.<br>
<p>
The Enlightenment after Newton thought of the universe as a clock.  More<br>
recently we thought of the universe as a computer -- but that's really a<br>
more complicated clock.  Now we have quantum mechanics and the metaphor<br>
of cellular automata running around... but the universe still seems<br>
fairly conceivable as a complicated clock with dice in the spring.<br>
Perhaps those dice represent something fundamental we don't know... but<br>
perhaps not.  Dice make at least as much sense as a clock.<br>
<p>
And we -- or many of us -- seem to be universal Turing machines, or<br>
capable of acting that way.  Given this view, it is hard to see how the<br>
universe could generate any problems not capable of being comprehended<br>
by us, apart from existence.  There could be things our minds aren't big<br>
enough to grasp, ideas we don't have the memory to hold the parts of;<br>
there could be Powers capable of thinking faster than we do; but those<br>
are the differences between a computer with 16 megs of RAM and 4K, or<br>
between a Pentium and a 8086.  A qualitative difference would be that<br>
between any computer and a wristwatch.  To believe that there is such a<br>
difference above us is purely a matter of belief.  Act on it if you<br>
wish; I find myself believing that no Power could do something which a<br>
liberal-minded cosmopolitan could not understand, given time and data.<br>
<p>
My very vague thesis: All undamaged human beings, and other sentiences,<br>
share the same area of comprehensibility.<br>
<p>
Corollary: "I" may never know if I'm wrong.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>

Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without<br>
difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton beginning to talk to him.<br>
