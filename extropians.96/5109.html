Reading Homo Excelsior, using that wonderful Omega Database (great work<br>
guys!), I came across the Lofstrom Loop concept, which seemed rather<br>
intriguing. There was not much detail on it, except that it used TWO<br>
space stations and one ground station, with an EM propelled/controlled<br>
"stream of bars", which I did not understand the purpose for, unless<br>
they can carry payload.<br>
<p>
Putting some old Thunkthussp onto the problem, I concieved another type<br>
of construction, that we could call a Lorrey Loop, if it hasn't already<br>
been thought of yet by someone else. (besides, it would really truck<br>
too!) ;)<br>
<p>
Essentially, you have one station at geosynch, that is say a hundred<br>
miles long, containing a main EM rail system, and an<br>
accelerator/decellerator rail in parallel. On the opposite side of the<br>
planet, you've got a ground station, with a similar EM setup. <br>
<p>
Now imagine a big loop going all the way around the planet, with its<br>
apogee at the geosynch station and perigee at the ground station. This<br>
loop, seeing as how it will be traveling quite fast at perigee and slow<br>
at apogee, would necessarily be actually simply a virtual path or<br>
corridor for a continuous line of "cars", as if it were a solid loop it<br>
would tear itself apart (solid orbital loops being quite impossible and<br>
unstable). <br>
<p>
The cars would, when reaching the geosynch station, be traveling at the<br>
same velocity as the station, from which they can either dump their<br>
load, accept a load, or be switched to the parallel system for<br>
changeover to an accelerator for transition to higher orbit or<br>
interplanetary trajectory.<br>
<p>
To build this system, you'd want a high altitude equatorial area for the<br>
ground station (Ecuador, Kenya?, maybe the Spine of PauPau New Guinea?)<br>
<p>
Its a bit different from what I've seen in other concepts, which require<br>
either towers or actual vertical linkage (!!!) the stress alone would<br>
require materials at least a hundred times more structurally sound than<br>
those known today. using linear motors and orbital mechanics from<br>
geosynch to surface, a true sky hook could be possible.<br>
<p>
For those who say ground based accelerators are impossible, I will<br>
direct you to study up on the papers of the late Dr. Gerald Bull (known<br>
as the father of the Supergun) who conclusively proved (on paper, and<br>
would have proved in practice if that darn pesky Gulf War and the<br>
Isreali assasins haddn't gotten in the way) that using conventional<br>
materials and normal chemical artillery propellants, a gun could be<br>
constructed that would be capable of placing materials in orbit, with<br>
guns specifications similar to that quoted by HG Wells' old novel. If<br>
such things can be accomplished with conventional 19th century<br>
technology, certainly using 21st century superconductor technology we<br>
could do even better.<br>
