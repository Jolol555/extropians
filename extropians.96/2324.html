        Likewise.  I intended to respond earlier to the initial statement<br>
that said artists are more interested in form than function, but I guess<br>
I'll do that now.  As with Nadia, I put a lot of emphasis on form.  Take my<br>
poetry for example: it is not often that I write blank verse.  Nor do I use<br>
imbalanced stanzas, verses, etc.  However, my poetry has a very important<br>
function: to spread my views; mainly my extropian views.  But in the end, my<br>
poetry *is*.  What people wish to make of it is up to them.<br>
