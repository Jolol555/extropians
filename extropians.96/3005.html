<i>&gt; Would the military experiment on us like that? and was that 7 state</i><br>

<i>&gt; Warfare!!</i><br>
The problem with rail guns is not the size of the rail. You can build<br>
one the size of a pistol to give equivalent muzzle velocity. The problem<br>
is in the power supply. TO give sufficient gauss, with current capacitor<br>
technology, you would need a backpack full to get enough power for a few<br>
blasts, plus a power supply to "reload".<br>
<p>
With EMP weapons, these are possible, though you need to place your<br>
weapon in very close proximity to avoid inverse squared dissipation,<br>
unless you created a special focused device that used two transmitters<br>
to create scalar zones. I invented one of these to work with my radar<br>
detector against cops while I was in the Air Force. THe US DOD now owns<br>
the designs......  ;-)<br>
