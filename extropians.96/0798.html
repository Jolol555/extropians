About the sponsor:<br>
<p>
  The California Institute for Applied Objectivism (CIAO) is a Los Angeles<br>
based nonprofit organization founded to promote applied Objectivism among<br>
admirers of Ayn Rand's philosophy who live in southern California.  Its<br>
primary mission is to produce regular lectures by leading Objectivist<br>
intellectuals, such as David Kelley, Robert James Bidinotto, David Ross,<br>
Ronald Merrill and Tibor Machan.<br>
<p>
  The first event will be, in part, an opportunity for local supporters<br>
to provide us with information about what they would like from an<br>
Objectivist organization.  Possible activities include producing seminars,<br>
discussion groups, recreational events, singles groups, and business/<br>
professional subgroups.<br>
<p>
  For more information about CIAO -- or to be added to our permanent<br>
mailing list -- contact its director, Joshua Zader, at the address listed<br>
above.<br>
