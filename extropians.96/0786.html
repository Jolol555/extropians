<i>&gt;My bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;in response to the "productive people each supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt;millions of destitute loafers in the future":  Why would we</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to do that?  Point being, they'd just keep breeding</i><br>
<i>&gt;without foresight until they surpassed all the carrying</i><br>
<i>&gt;capacity of the planet, and even with hightech, until in one</i><br>
<i>&gt;last malthusian collapse they tried to consume the</i><br>
<i>&gt;remaining products of civilization, leaving a burned out</i><br>
<i>&gt;world without resources and with a slaughtered intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;elite.  Let's face it, the only solution is to make conception</i><br>
<i>&gt;a cognitive and pricey activity, thereby guaranteeing at</i><br>
<i>&gt;least a semblance of planning, foresight and economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;wear-with-all.  Let contagious nanotech provide universal</i><br>
<i>&gt;barriers to all accidental conception.  The population</i><br>
<i>&gt;would drop to very comfortable and elite levels within two</i><br>
<i>&gt;generations.</i><br>
This won't occur at all! Simply because millions are being infected in india<br>
and asia currently with HIV and so far there's no cure in sight. (unless you<br>
count nanotech or viruses engineered to go out and kill HIV which won't be<br>
for awhile) So this in itself will suck away a large portion of the low<br>
intellect populous (it sounds cruel but true do to poor families stifling<br>
their children's brain growth from malnutrition). This should open up vast<br>
quantities of FREE LAND! Where we extropians can go out and claim it and<br>
create a new country! :) (sick sense of humor).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for uploading and becoming von neuman machines. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Honestly, am I the only extropian who likes the flesh?</i><br>
We don't hate the flesh, we enjoy it while looking towards better alternatives.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm just an immortalist who<br>
<i>&gt;thinks the whole universe should be our domain.</i><br>
It can be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I guess I</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't mind being able to have alternate _identities_  of</i><br>
<i>&gt;man, machine, cyborg, virtual entity--but I certainly don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to be constrained to one.</i><br>
Why would you be constrained? You could simply upload your brain to a<br>
computer inside a box in a human biological drone's brain where you could<br>
control the body from the box in it's head with the box being an interface<br>
between the body and the digital consciousness. Therefore you'd experience<br>
all human toils if you wished, but you can also simply emulate them in<br>
virtual space so why go to all the trouble?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nor give up the best of</i><br>
<i>&gt;humanity.</i><br>
You would do neither<br>
<p>
  A product of the mind is art.  And beauty is<br>
<i>&gt;art.  For those who think I'm shallow.  Take a look at</i><br>
<i>&gt;Michelangelo's David.  I guess I'm as attached to physical</i><br>
<i>&gt;beauty as I am to intellectual brilliance and scientific truth.</i><br>
So what? Everything in virtual space will appear to you as 'real'. Maybe you<br>
can't grasp the concept of what it would be like to be uploaded? Everyting<br>
in virtual space would appear real and tactile to you. You could use every<br>
sense in the virtual space or even amplify them. You could design new<br>
emotions even. You could appear in the virtual space any way you wished to<br>
look. You could even keep your original body post uploading and dispose of<br>
the biological brain and put a box in it's skull cavity so that you could<br>
control your original body when you wished. It would be as though you were<br>
in your original body and hadn't been uploaded yet but you could have access<br>
to the sum of human knowledge via wireless lan connections from the box in<br>
your body's head to the internet. I want a T1 wired to my brain! :) You<br>
could even have multiple bodies with different features and characteristics<br>
and looks and jump in and out of them.<br>
