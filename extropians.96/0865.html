<p>
What? Don't you believe the beautiful architect sketches of how nice the <br>
new building is going to be, and how happy and social the inhabitants <br>
will be? :-)<br>
<p>
As others pointed out, good 3D windows would give everyone a perfect <br>
view, with no need to build an Arcology with apartments only at the <br>
surface (Hmm, a very long and thin wall - could separate two ecosystems <br>
in an aesthetic way). But in that case, you don't need to build the <br>
arcology in the rainforest either. The big problem with this is <br>
psychological: many people would feel constrained if they knew they lived <br>
in a big hive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW, if that window view of nature is so important to your determination</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "cool", doesn't it seem likely that a connection to nature is somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary to the human psyche, perhaps more than an archology can</i><br>
<i>&gt; offer.</i><br>
<p>
Why not integrate both? I seriously think the arcology of the future will <br>
be more lush and natural on the *inside* than on the outside. With <br>
ecotech, genetic engineering and some clever planning we might live in <br>
(say) vertical tree-cities (shades of the Evoks in Return of the jedi), <br>
around artificial trees that are both living and structural support, <br>
contains the plumbing, networking equipment etc. Instead of trying to <br>
move as far as possible away from our ancestors, we might do a synthesis <br>
instead. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I go for the solution of more space or less people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now mile high buildings within a traditional city are another matter.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; cool!  (But who will put up with a five minute elevator ride several times a</i><br>
<i>&gt; day?)</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention the pressure differentials. I really get annoyed by even <br>
small changes in pressure. <br>
<p>
The answer is of course: don't think of the elevators as elevators, see <br>
them as taxis or local trains. We somehow accept having to move around in <br>
a city several times a day, despite it taking several minutes and more.<br>
<p>
One ideal sturcture might be a superscraper city with buildings linked by <br>
quick transit lines on bridges, with an extensive park level on the <br>
ground (and probably local ecologies higher up). Sounds a bit like <br>
classic sf. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Okay, I know Max Moore is going to pummel me on this one, but are we</i><br>
<i>&gt; all sticking to the party line that FTL travel is really impossible?  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt; teleportation?</i><br>
<p>
Party line? It is a scientific question, not ideological. FTL is currently<br>
regarded as extremely unlikely since it would mess up some rather likely<br>
assumptions in physics (matter and energy can only exist as positive<br>
energy densities, cause and effect and all that). It might be possible,<br>
but there is no evidence for its possibility yet (although some intriguing<br>
theoretical possibilities like wormholes, the Novikov consistency theorems<br>
and the Alcubierre drive). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here's an informal poll?  What do you all consider the comfortable</i><br>
<i>&gt; carrying capacity of the planet?  Not the maximum.  </i><br>
<p>
Depends on how you want to live. Some people might like an agrarian <br>
lifestyle, which would require larger areas than a highly automated city <br>
lifestyle. <br>
<p>
Personally I like to have big cities, and little between them (although <br>
there will no doubt be many people who would want to live there; myself, <br>
I like to have wast tracts of self-running nature which I don't have to <br>
deal with but can admire). This could lead to very high or low population <br>
numbers, depending on the number of cities and their size. <br>
<p>
Resource-wise, I think we could estimate that a few billion people could <br>
live sustainably with close-to-present technology, and probably several <br>
tens or billion with nanotechnology. But it depends on more factors than <br>
that. <br>
