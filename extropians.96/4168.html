Hi David:<br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;brin@cts.com Sun Dec 15                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;They'll [power centers] still screw us if they ever get the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;chance.  Your complacency seems strange, given your                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;prescription for paranoid encryption.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Power exists in society (fortunately, I'd hate to live in a powerless world) <br>
and like matter, energy, information, and everything else in the  Universe, <br>
it is not distributed evenly; after all, we've known for more than a century  <br>
that the aether does not exist. Raging against power centers is like raging <br>
against electromagnetism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;Bullshit.  Kazynski would use PGP if he could.                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Kazynski never used PGP, he wouldn't dream of such a thing, he hated it more  <br>
than you do, it's FAR too high tech for him. On the other hand, we know for  <br>
certain that he used a bicycle to help him in his nefarious activities.  <br>
Should bicycles be banned?                                                         <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;When OTHER Kazynskis want to do it, they most certainly will.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, bad people as well as good will use PGP, just like every other invention <br>
any human being has ever made.<br>
<p>
Let's forget about morality for a minute and talk a little about practicality.  <br>
The government has shown that it is utterly incapable of stopping even <br>
something as concrete as an object from coming into the country, an object <br>
like hundreds of tons of cocaine or many thousands of tons of cannabis. <br>
Encryption is just Mathematics and PGP is not an object, it's a sequence of<br>
bits. If you can't even stop objects from entering the nation how on earth <br>
are you going to stop bits, bits that can be duplicated endlessly at no cost, <br>
bits that can be easily and very effectively hidden, bits that can make use <br>
of the new communication channels that open up daily to every part of the<br>
planet? Like it or not the world is changing, learn to live with it.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I know that men who escape accountability often conspire               </i><br>
<i>                &gt;together to rob other men of their liberty, and then their    </i><br>
<i>                &gt;women and wheat.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I'll make a deal with you, if you don't call "privacy" my mantra I won't call <br>
"accountability" yours.                 <br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I don't care how good your PGP is, it won't matter when the                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;secret police subborn your correspondents, infiltrate your                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;conversation cells, learn the prime factors, then break down                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;your doors and kill you. But not before persuading you to      </i><br>
<i>                &gt;help trap your remaining friends.</i><br>
<p>
                 <br>
First of all, I could communicate, send money, even sign contracts with my <br>
correspondents without them knowing my location or true name and without me <br>
knowing theirs, but there's a broader issue here. <br>
<p>
You're postulating a nightmare 1984  type society, and I'm saying that recent  <br>
advances in communication and encryption are the very things that will stop <br>
it from happening, long before things have degenerated to such a sorry state.  <br>
If Big Brother was somehow put in power could encryption overthrow him, even <br>
if he tried a scorched earth, back to the land, destroy all machines, policy  <br>
as the Communists did in Cambodia? I honestly don't know, there are no  <br>
guaranties in the world of human affairs, but I think there is a good chance.  <br>
I do know that your "Transparent Society" would not work. The idea of saying <br>
"Please Mr. Secret Policeman, let me hang this camera around your neck so I <br>
can make sure you don't do anything nasty" is not viable, for that matter, <br>
do you imagine the The President would stand for it, that he would let you  <br>
turn on your TV anytime you wanted and watch him work? Do you really believe <br>
that? If so I'd like to talk to you about investing in my perpetual motion<br>
machine company and I have some swamp land I'd like to sell you.<br>
                 <br>
<i>                &gt;Be well.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You too.<br>
                                           <br>
                                            John K Clark      johnkc@well.com<br>
