    "Jay Reynolds Freeman" is the name the Squirrel was given by his<br>
parents.  He is the "First Extropian Squirrel" by virtue of a<br>
discussion several years ago in which he was a staunch advocate of<br>
environmentalism and animal rights.<br>
<p>
    The Squirrel introduced himself as a download from the high<br>
transcend, here associating with beings with mere Jupiter-sized brains<br>
out of a perverse interest in slumming.<br>
<p>
    Many list members no doubt find the Squirrel's real name<br>
bothersome, for his favorite economic system is socialism, he prefers<br>
a strong central government, and he regards libertarianism and<br>
anarcho-capitalism as ludicrous.  He reads the list out of an interest<br>
in the science and technology, and is usually polite enough to avoid<br>
its discussions of political economy.  His .sig files have upon<br>
occasion been controversial.<br>
<p>
    Upward and outward...<br>
