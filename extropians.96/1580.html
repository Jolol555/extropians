<i>&gt;Sorry, Robin. I thought this was self-evident, but apparently not. IMO</i><br>
<i>&gt;a person/entity with dramatically higher intelligence can invent and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then use an array of vastly-improved products and processes. These</i><br>
<i>&gt;products and processes will rapidly and radically affect the economy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but this is a side-effect. The crucial difference is in the feedback,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as the entity invents and implements additional</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence-augmenting devices, algorithms, and processes. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;You may argue that the industrial revolution is an analogy. At that</i><br>
<i>&gt;point, we began to use machines to produce machines. That did in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce fairly radical changes in the economy and in society over a</i><br>
<i>&gt;historically short period.  ...  intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt;augmentation has the potential to happen in a much shorter time. </i><br>
<p>
The issue is not the existence of feedback, a point we both granted<br>
long ago.  Feedback happens with all technlogical and economic growth.<br>
Even before the industrial revolution.  <br>
<p>
The whole issue is about the rates of change.  You have been claiming<br>
that this technology will produce much faster rates of change and<br>
economic growth than we have seen with other technologies, and I have<br>
been asking for your reasons.  In the above, you simply repeat your<br>
claim of faster change several times, but do not give reasons.<br>
