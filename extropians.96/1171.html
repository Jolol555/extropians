Yes, but they would have never made it to that point had they not absorbed<br>
entire libraries full of black and white facts. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
Seriously, I agree there are paradoxes, there is a time for doubting<br>
certainty, and there is utility to fuzzy logic.  But these are not useful<br>
starting points -- especially not for children.<br>
<p>
Which leads me to another thought: if at bottom the universe is just grey<br>
mush, doesn't this suggest a limit to scientific progress?  [He shudders.]<br>
How do you control something that exists merely within a range of<br>
probabilities?  Perhaps there are some physicists around here who can<br>
provide reassuring answers...<br>
