&lt;P.S. There was another hook in there which no one bit at.  I'm sort <br>
of glad because then I'd have to take the time to struggle with that <br>
fish (and it's a big one!)&gt;<br>
<p>
J de Lyser asked:<br>
&lt;the way i see it there were many little hooks in there, if you'd like <br>
to be more specific ?&gt;<br>
<p>
I originally quoted from Geoff Ryman's _The Child Garden_:<br>
&lt;Viruses made people cheerful and helpful and honest. Their manners <br>
were impeccable, their conversation well-informed, their work speedy <br>
and accurate. They believed the same things.&gt;<br>
<p>
And then I added:<br>
&lt;Hmmm, sounds alot like David Pearce's Hedonistic Imperative - only <br>
much gentler!&gt;<br>

This reference has been mentioned several times on the list, but no <br>
one has discussed it in any depth since the Extropians list moved to a <br>
more open platform last August.  It might have been 'discussed to <br>
death' on the old list, but I wouldn't know.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I don't have any problem with the basic premise of hedonism - <br>
that it's OK to use nootropics and 'mechanical' enhancements for <br>
intelligence augmentation, and psychopharmacology, or even *some <br>
degree* of neuro-anatomical redesign for emotional <br>
self-transformation.<br>
<p>
However, there's MUCH more to Pearce's Hedonistic Imperative than <br>
that!<br>
Some snippets follow:<br>
&lt;The Hedonistic Imperative argues that within the next thousand years <br>
or so the application of nanotechnology, eugenics, genetic engineering <br>
and clinical psychopharmacology will *eliminate* the biological <br>
substrates of suffering in *all* its varieties of indescribable <br>
awfulness, *everywhere*....<br>
<p>
 In future, anyhow, the life-forms which exist on the planet will be <br>
there *purely* because we allow them to do so, or choose to create <br>
them....<br>
<p>
At some momentous and *exactly* datable time ... the *last* unpleasant <br>
experience ever to occur on this planet will take place, possibly a <br>
(purely comparatively) minor pain in some (to us) obscure marine <br>
invertebrate....&gt;<br>
<p>
(*emphasis* mine)<br>
<p>
This involves the ethical issues that David Musick is currently <br>
attempting to raise in the Vegetarianism and Ethics thread.  It also <br>
involves the Spontaneous Order vs. Directed-Design memes that are <br>
frequently raised in discussions of nanotechnology and various <br>
permutations of The Great Filter thread and grey-goo scenarios.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this is not discussed because, as Eliezer might say, it's a <br>
post-Singularity issue that *only* the Powers can decide.  I don't <br>
have any problem with reconfiguring "the matter and energy of the <br>
world in any way we so desire", *except* that 'matter' and 'energy' <br>
are extremely simplistic ways of viewing the organic world.  I <br>
certainly don't have answers for these concerns; but, I don't consider <br>
other 'conscious beings' to be *simply* units of matter and energy for <br>
my own consumption and entertainment.  I am fairly certain that we <br>
(and our descendants) can never fully escape from evolutionary forces <br>
and that there are likely to be serious problems with any human (or <br>
<i>&gt;H) _plan_ to eliminate all aversive experience and *totally* control </i><br>
all aspects of our environment.  Perhaps the real problem here is that <br>
it is impossible to *completely* define the boundaries of self apart <br>
from the environment in which the self must exist.<br>
