Hey, Ian, thanks for the info. on Cannabis.  I didn't know it was such good <br>
medicine for so many things.  I'll have to increase my dosage.  Aren't herbal <br>
remedies great!<br>
<p>
I thought your article was wonderful, so I formatted it nicely with my word <br>
processor and faxed it to a bunch of news outlets across the country.  I know, <br>
you wrote on it that it could be freely copied for non-profit (and I inclueded <br>
that), so I don't know if any of the news outlets will publish it, but it may <br>
inform some of the reporters there, and they may do their own research on the <br>
subject and publish that.<br>
<p>
I think the War on Drugs, like all violent activity, is highly entropic, and I <br>
think working to end the Drug War Nightmare is a worthy Extropian goal.  There <br>
are so many psychoactive drugs which are wonderful for mind exploration and <br>
growth.  As an Extropian, I wish I had greater access to these substances, to <br>
use in my self-transformative work. <br>
<p>
One thing I've started doing to help end the War on Drugs is to write letters <br>
to the editor of my local newspapers.  The problem, though, with letters to <br>
the editor is that the newspaper will only publish so many letters from a <br>
single author.  I've written so many letters to the editor on various <br>
subjects, that I have a hard time getting my stuff printed any more.  But I <br>
found a loophole -- the paper usually requires a name and address on all the <br>
letters, but if one has a compelling reason to remain anonymous (if what you <br>
have to say would embarrass or endanger you, for example) then the newspaper <br>
may print the letter anyway.  So, I've started writing anonymous letters, <br>
written as though they are from various people who use drugs and are <br>
productive members of society.  The letters bring up the fact that if they <br>
were caught, they would be put in jail and no longer able to contribute to <br>
society or support their families with their work.  They also bring up other <br>
injustices and stupidities of the drug war.  I'm hoping that if I send in <br>
enough of these types of letters, a few of them will actually get printed.  In <br>
some of the letters, I will encourage other drug users to write their own <br>
letters.  Hopefully, these will be printed, and more people will write letters <br>
about the subject.  Also, including that instruction in some of my letters <br>
will help me maintain the illusion that the many letters I send in are in fact <br>
coming from many different people.  Writing them in different styles and fonts <br>
will also help maintain this illusion.<br>
<p>
I encourage other Extropians who are interested in ending the War on Drugs to <br>
do similar things and to encourage others to help in our effort for Peace.  <br>
Also, if anyone has addresses of various newspapers, even if it's only your <br>
local newspaper, I would be interested in having that information.  I'm <br>
wanting to send stuff to lots of newspapers around the country.<br>
<p>
If anyone has any other ideas for how we can help end the War on Drugs, I <br>
would be glad to hear them.<br>
<p>
