CHRIS HIND WRITES:<br>
<i>&gt;I wish to undertake an incredible task. I wish to find the locations of</i><br>
everyone on this list so as to organize the movement further. All I need is<br>
<i>&gt;your city, state in the form below:</i><br>
<p>
&lt;In HEADING of message&gt;<br>
To: chind@juno.com<br>
Subject: Extropian Data Entry<br>
<p>
&lt;In BODY of message&gt;<br>
(city), (state or country) - (name) (email in parentheses)<br>
<p>
<p>
Example follows<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Using this we can find the points of power across the planet and plan a</i><br>
media attack strategy. Spread the memes as far as possible!<br>
<p>
<p>
Um, HEY.... Chris shoudnt you see whethere a <br>
"media attack" is what is really wanted? Do some <br>
homework?<br>
<p>
For example, in Cryonics, there is a danger of half<br>
baked schemes and unthought out plans making everyone<br>
look bad, where suddenly the WHOLE movement is banned, and becomes<br>
 scutinized in the wrong way under government and/or public attack, and you<br>
could literally KILL us with your <br>
"media attack".<br>
<p>
Theses are delicate balances and things have repercussions.<br>
Chris, you are enthusiastic newbie, that is wonderful, I'm a newbie too,  but<br>
please check in with people more knowledgeable than yourself before you take<br>
any action "in our Extropian behalf".<br>
I really mean this.<br>
Ask Max, do some homework, read about the transhumanist movement. <br>
 You may find many people have a quite different take on this than YOU.<br>
Please think things though before you jump.<br>
<p>
I, FOR ONE, WOULD NOT WANT YOU TO SPEAK FOR ME!<br>
 (However well intentioned)<br>
Thank you for your time, <br>
Nadia<br>
