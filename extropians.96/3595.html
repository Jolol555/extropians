&lt;Could somebody explain the title [_A Fire Upon the Deep_] to me? This was <br>

it means. Thanks!&gt;<br>

Well, here's one interpretation:  The Deep is the gallactic mind / Zones of <br>
Thought / KnownNet.  Suddenly, an all-consuming Power / Algernon is <br>
awakened with a centrally-planned design to replace the way-too-slow and <br>
'insensitive' mechanisms of evolution, with a burning desire to create an <br>
expanding cloud of everlasting 'life', to convert all the "dead matter" <br>
into "useful" energy.  A wildfire rages until the firemen from beyond the <br>
Beyond have to be called in to cool things down.  How you would translate <br>
this into Russian I have no idea.<br>
