Effective communication also depends on what you want to communicate. You <br>
can probably effectively communicate your hunger to most people on the <br>
planet. <br>
<p>

Perhaps (?) 'a lot of _misunderstanding_ stems from assumption.'<br>
<p>

within our words.  Any help or enlightenment as to *how* would be <br>
appreciated!  :~)<br>
<p>
My experience has been that effective listening helps lead to effective <br>
communication. That and asking questions. Also, as a thought experiment <br>
listen to yourself and others, and interpret what they say literally. <br>
This leads to many questions for definition of terms. "What do you mean <br>
your 'job is driving you crazy?'" "By assumption do you mean 'taking for <br>
granted?'"<br>
	And, it helps to sometimes ask stupid questions. I have been <br>
surprised at how much I assumed. Sometimes even the most self-evident <br>
'facts' (like humans should migrate to space, or dinosaurs once walked <br>
the earth, or the highway is west of here or, in fact, just about any <br>
statement using the word 'is'.)<br>
	How, though, do we effectively tele-communicate? &gt;, *, and :-)'s <br>
all help, but they are far from getting the job done. (Ever notice how <br>
smiley faces are never written after something really funny? :-&gt; <br>
<p>
Though some of us (perhaps most of us) can't read HTML enhanced text <br>
within our email, isn't that the way of the future? The simple nuances of <br>
boldface and italics go a long way to conveying the tone of the users <br>
voice. (And color, font, layout, sketches, etc.)<br>
	But, of course, this is just email. Any suggestions for other <br>
fora?<br>
	One last thing. I found the Neuro-Linguistic Programming stuff <br>
really interesting. Made even moreso by the peculiar life of Bandler.<br>
