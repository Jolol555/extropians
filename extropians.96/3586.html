        Sorry to bring you down to this strictly mortal plane, Eliezer, but<br>
my post --though equal to zero in content-- did achieve its initial intent<br>
of finding some human flaw in your thinking: self-righteousness.  You *are*<br>
an arrogant bastard; be it relevant or irrelevant, it is a fact.  Another<br>
flaw in your thinking is that there are guidelines to follow.  If you value<br>
original ideas so much, why do you constantly refer to Douglas Hofstadter's<br>
thoughts?  Many on this list have read _Godel, Escher, Bach_, so why<br>
reiterate?  How many *new* ideas have *you* contributed?  Perhaps my<br>
strictly mortal response has proved your point, but *your* strictly mortal<br>
response has most certainly proved mine.  I hope that anyone reading this<br>
post isn't opposed to my bluntness, I'm just calling things as *I* see them.  <br>
