<p>
The problem here seems to be one of definition.  A word is only useful if it<br>
can be used for something.  If "understand" is limited to such an extent that<br>
we can understand nothing, the word becomes useless.  It may be more useful<br>
to say it is impossible "to know" an object (object is different from<br>
information).<br>
<p>
It is amazing how many discussions revolve around definitions.  The chicken<br>
and the egg problem is one example.  Most people there is an easy solution<br>
but eggs have been around longer than vertebrates.  Obviously, most people<br>
are using a different definition of egg.  The tree falling in the forest with<br>
nobody to hear it is another example.  It depends on how you define sound.<br>
 The list goes on and on.<br>
