<i>&gt;I use cubase 3.0 on a P1333 and i don't have any problems at all. (you</i><br>
<i>&gt;should have tried the stuff back in the goood old days when we where</i><br>
<i>&gt;using analog sync)</i><br>
<i>&gt;these days the life of a musician is everything peaches .... well</i><br>
<i>&gt;serious it's a joy to make music these days.</i><br>

If you are using Windows 95, it is workable, but NT is kind of flaky for<br>
heavy duty MIDI work (and there is minimal support for NT anyway).  <br>
<p>
I have to agree that it is a great time to be a musician.  The music<br>
electronics industry has followed its own "Moore's Law" type progression,<br>
quite possibly due to its dependance on microprocessor technology.  Bottom<br>
line is that you can get enormous quantities of sound generating horsepower<br>
for peanuts now and even the analog components (like mixing consoles) have<br>
plummetted in cost (All Hail Greg Mackie!) and increased in quality.  It is<br>
finally possible and cost effective for a single individual to compete<br>
head-to-head with million dollar studios.  I love this fact, because I<br>
remember when it was very expensive to really get into professional audio<br>
production.  The last few years has been a real equalizer for musicians,<br>
allowing the music industry to become a little more decentralized.<br>
<p>
I am already planning (financially) my re-entry into the music scene.  Music<br>
is probably my only purely artistic talent, and I have regretted selling my<br>
equipment every day since I sold it.  Creating music was a superb outlet for<br>
my brain that I have not been able to replace, and I have suffered for the<br>
lack of it.<br>
