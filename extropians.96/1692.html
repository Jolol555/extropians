<i>&gt; Fine, sounds like something worth a try, sometimes a big corporation becomes </i><br>

My point is that competition cannot help worker conditions, nor can it <br>
eliminate the authoritarian nature of business. The coop  may not be able <br>
to compete with the big corporation because they pay fair equal wages, <br>
while the big corporation may not. The only advantage they have is that <br>
people there are more motivated because the work they do is their own.<br>

1400$ per person in corporate subsidy, 400 dollars per person for welfare <br>

<i>&gt; The only hope these people have is to live on charity until they can learn a </i><br>
<i>&gt; marketable skill. If most people do not feel charitable toward them then they </i><br>
<i>&gt; are in deep trouble, but government can't help. If I am unwilling to </i><br>
<i>&gt; voluntarily give money to these people why would I vote for a politician who</i><br>
<i>&gt; would force me to do it through taxes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<p>
The fact that we need politicians, who pretty much have the same class<br>
interests as the business men to keep whatever semblance of equality <br>
shows how messed up the liberal capitalist democracy system is.<br>
<p>
 What I propose is this:Anarcho-syndicalism, as advocated by Rudolf <br>
Rocker and Noam Chomsky, souped up into a hi-tech version by yours truly. <br>
Private property is abolished, as the only way to hold <br>
private property is by right of force, and since there is no need for a <br>
government to keep people in check, that would be abolished as well. Most <br>
crime comes from poverty, and the rest can easily be dealt  with by <br>
citizens.  Okay, ask me questions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I really don't understand it, whenever somebody wants to show how evil </i><br>
<i>&gt; corporations are, they always come up with a long list of rotten things that </i><br>
<i>&gt; governments do. Granted, few companies actively opposed these monstrous  </i><br>
<i>&gt; regimes, but that's not quite the same thing as instigating it, and anyway  </i><br>
<i>&gt; can you really blame them for not playing the hero, in most cases it would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; economic if not real suicide.</i><br>
<p>
It's not like corporations aren't actively prpping up these businesses. <br>
Dole fruit , for example, keeps the aristocracy in power   while the U.S. <br>
keeps the military in power. Corporations and government are two sides of <br>
the same elite group. They both support each other. Quote from Sprint's <br>
CEO I heard last night that got me rather irate "Bill Clinton has been <br>
good for American Business"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It would really be great if that was true, then justice could be treated like </i><br>
<i>&gt; a commodity, surely the best way to maximize it, but unfortunately it is not </i><br>
<i>&gt; true .</i><br>
<p>
I really don't see that. Explain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Equality is a second rate sort of virtue, you can't have too much justice or </i><br>
<i>&gt; truth or beauty or intelligence or kindness, but you can have too much  </i><br>
<i>&gt; equality.          </i><br>
<p>
In the same way that  you can have too much liberty.  I don't think <br>
everybody should be reduced to the lowest common <br>
denominator. Instead, equal access to resources <br>
to do with as you will, provided it doesn't harm <br>
anyone else's access or human rights. This needs <br>
some elaboration, which I will provide if asked.                         &gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good heavens NO!!! I don't care for it myself but I definitely think altruism </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be just perfect for you, and for everybody else for that matter. I have  </i><br>
<i>&gt; often said Anarchy is only the second best system, undoubtedly the best is  </i><br>
<i>&gt; one where everybody just does what I want them to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If humanity is truly going to ascend and take  our place in                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;the universe, a then we need to cultivate a sense of respect                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;and a little bit of compassion for each other   </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True. I confess I was being a little glib before, but only a little. The </i><br>
<i>&gt; truth is I engage in compassion myself, but I do so for selfish reasons, </i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing somebody in pain makes me unhappy and if I am the cause of that pain </i><br>
<i>&gt; then I'm even more unhappy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I own a steel mill worth a billion dollars, that does not take money from </i><br>
<i>&gt; poor people, just the reverse, it produces a product that people want and </i><br>
<i>&gt; jobs that people need. I will be able to keep my steel mill only as long as I </i><br>
<i>&gt; can run it as well or better than anyone else.  The day somebody finds a way </i><br>
<i>&gt; to operate a mill significantly better than I do is the day I go broke,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; unless I learn real fast and copy his technique. Having a public mob run the </i><br>
<i>&gt; mill will produce little wealth for anyone. </i><br>
<p>
Unless (gasp) the workers ran the mill themselves.  Operating a mill <br>
better tends to mean "how much wages can I take away without reducing the <br>
output of my workers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then it is in a corporation's best interest to expand its market and make as  </i><br>
<i>&gt; many people affluent as possible.</i><br>
<p>
No, it is in the corporations interest to consolidate affluence so that <br>
it has no need to tailor it's product to different <br>
cultures. Make sure all the rich share the same <br>
tastes, so they can buy more of the same thing.&gt;                    &gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then dump the Government not the business. We can live just fine without </i><br>
<i>&gt; Government but we'd all starve to death without business.</i><br>
<p>
Ditch em both<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I think the rulers of governments should do that, but it doesn't matter </i><br>
<i>&gt; a bit what you or I think, our masters will do what they want to do. The </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason the free market sometimes looks  bad in debates like this is that </i><br>
<i>&gt; people are comparing the market as it actually is, warts and all, with a </i><br>
<i>&gt; mythical government lead by a man who always knows exactly what the right  </i><br>
<i>&gt; thing to do is, always has the moral courage to do it, and can convince those </i><br>
<i>&gt; less wonderful than he is that it is indeed the correct path to take. A man </i><br>
<i>&gt; like that never existed and never will, yet people keep thinking if we  can </i><br>
<i>&gt; just elect the right man everything will be fine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I agree, but it's both the bankers and the rulers of <br>
governments. The business people have pretty much the <br>
same power as a politician.                 &gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It doesn't matter how much it takes to feed you, it doesn't  matter how big </i><br>
<i>&gt; your family is, if your services are only worth 75 cents an hour to me then </i><br>
<i>&gt; that's all I would pay for them, unless I was giving charity. Don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; misunderstand, that might be  exactly what I decide to do, but I don't want </i><br>
<i>&gt; to  be forced and it shouldn't be confused for a salary.</i><br>
<p>
Theyre only worth 75 cents an hour to you because you can dictate prices <br>
to me, thanks to a very tangible power imbalance. Human labour has been <br>
commodified, so all we do is sell it to others.  <br>
<p>
To fight the argument "so anybody can start their own business". Two <br>
friends of mine tried, but they come from low income homes, don't have <br>
any credit history, and thus it is virtually impossible to get a loan, <br>
regardless of the merit of their idea(which I,personally thought  would <br>
sell). We like to pretend there is no class difference, but a kid who was <br>
coddled by his parents and sent to a top notch private school has a <br>
definite advantage over a kid born addicted to crack.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If people think what is on this network is valuable then people will watch it, </i><br>
<i>&gt; even pay for it. If people think it is worthless then I see no reason it </i><br>
<i>&gt; should be subsidized, that would just result in a huge network that nobody </i><br>
<i>&gt; watches, or should watch because it's junk.</i><br>
<p>
I don't want it subsidized, I would like to see it come out of peoples <br>
homes. I would like to see decentralized media. I don't <br>
want another big corporate station open to the public, I <br>
want the public doing their own media. <br>
<p>
People won't have any need to do this as long as they are beat over the <br>
head with establishment sound bites. Who am I to tell people what they <br>
should watch? That's like saying the system in Brave New World was <br>
acceptable because the people were happy.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Costs a lot? AOL charges 10$ a month and you can communicate with the world, </i><br>
<i>&gt; if anyone wants to listen.  The real reason that  people aren't demanding to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; read  Mr. Joe Average's home page is the same reason public access television  </i><br>
<i>&gt; is so dull, Mr. Joe Average has nothing worthwhile to say. You may not be  </i><br>
<i>&gt; average but superior, if so then people will read your Web page, and nobody  </i><br>
<i>&gt; can tell how much money you have only how much talent you have.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Really, and how much does a computer cost, especially when youre trying <br>
to pay the rent.<br>
