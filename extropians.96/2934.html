Casual Nobility<br>
---------------<br>
<p>
Safe inside this dome of glass I ponder on the meaning of it all<br>
Splendid sensibility and casual nobility:<br>
Rational agility proves to me that my purpose isn't small<br>
<p>
Secrets found and pleasure gained a name<br>
The future came and my life remained a game;<br>
Embassy of logic grew<br>
While I knew that my world would never be through -too much to do<br>
<p>
I can go the distance and do what I want to do, when and how<br>
Like transhumanity and temporary insanity<br>
The falsehoods of vanity only guise the meanings of the here and now<br>
<p>
A spotlight shone on the land before dawn<br>
I merged my brain and brawn -I was not a pawn;<br>
Reason shaped my trembling mind<br>
And I could find that I wouldn't get behind -nothing could bind<br>
<p>
So noble but so casual,<br>
Severely crucial to the sacred will<br>
<p>
Free to find a destiny and fulfill the search made for a long-lost goal;<br>
My neo-personality, my stellar rationality<br>
Antecedent brutality gone forever from my unencumbered soul<br>
<p>
No more lies -my spirit shall always rise<br>
The only prize is symmetrical compromise<br>
The present's all that I can give,<br>
But I forgive because I will always live<br>
<p>
So noble but so casual,<br>
Severely crucial to the sacred will<br>

        Ahhh.  This seems like a bit of a competition!  :-)  I apologize if<br>
this comes through a little late; my mail seems to be taking a longer time<br>
to go through than usual.  Oh, and by the way, do any of you reading this<br>
think that my signature file is a bit too big?  I didn't realize its size<br>
until I saw my last post come through.  Just killing two democrats with one<br>
bullet.<br>
