Olney, et al. only increases the public's mistrust of the scientific method<br>
and statistics.<br>
<p>
Dr. Olney's hypothesis does not say people affected by brain tumors consumed<br>
any aspartame at all.  The brain cancer data base does not track individuals<br>
use of aspartame.  Brain tumor incidence is increasing in people age 70,<br>
probably because better detection methods are used now e.g., MRI.  Products<br>
containing aspartame are used mostly by young and middle-aged people who's<br>
cancer rate is going _down_.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Olney left out data points for 1973 and 1974 because that would have shown<br>
the cancer rate was higher before aspartame was introduced.  How to lie with<br>
statistics:  Start the scale for the vertical axis close to the data points<br>
instead of at zero.  This will then exaggerate the curve.  <br>
<p>
National Cancer Institute data for brain cancer increased since 1973 (before<br>
aspartame) but leveled off in the last ten years (after aspartame).  However,<br>
aspartame use has increased ever since it's introduction.   This could show<br>
asparatame was NOT the cause.  Increase in brain cancer should correlate to<br>
increase use of aspartame use.  But, it doesn't.  To be equally silly:<br>
 Asparatame prevents brain tumors!<br>
<p>
Talk about poor FDA science?  What is Olney?<br>
<p>
I would say it is _way_ more likely to cause mouth, stomach and bowel cancer,<br>
yet that has also not been proven.  And, allergic reactions, e.g.<br>
 sensitization to formaldehyde.  The only proven side effect in<br>
non-phenylketonurics  (Phenylketonurics can die. That's one heck of a side<br>
effect)  WAS _felt_ (at least if not actually originating there) in the<br>
brain: headaches.   They _were_ a surpise to me.  Does anybody know the<br>
mechanism for an asparatame headache? <br>
<p>
I still can't stand the flavor, so I avoid asparatame anyway.<br>
