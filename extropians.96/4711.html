Humour and Sacred Cows<br>
<p>
Sacred cows limit our thinking; they are sacrosanct concepts nobody <br>
may question, not even ourselves. This makes them incredibly <br>
tenacious memes, even when they are obviously wrong or <br>
counterproductive. <br>
<p>
One way to notice your sacred cows is to note when you get angry <br>
when you discuss with others; their questioning may have aroused <br>
your defence of the sacred cow. <br>
<p>
Another sure way of revealing the sacred cows is to try to joke <br>
about them. If there is anything a sacred cow cannot stand, it is <br>
humour (at least about itself, joking about others sacred cows is <br>
quite acceptable). The best way to reveal someone to be a fanatic or <br>
memeoid is to see if he or she can joke about his or her beliefs. <br>
<p>
As I see it, transhumanism should always be serious but never <br>
solemn. Things that may not be joked about are quite often weak <br>
and brittle - that¹s why they may not be joked about. If a concept <br>
can stand being the victim of a joke without deflating, it is worth <br>
taking seriously since it obviously have some internal strength.<br>
<p>
As I once put it, the goal of transhumanism is to create gods that <br>
can pun - and can stand being joked about. <br>
<p>
