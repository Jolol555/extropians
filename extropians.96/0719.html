A while back Anders meantioned his web page with physical improvements. And<br>
this was from his post relating to it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Youthful idealism" might be partially hormonal, a way to make young males</i><br>
<i>&gt;restless and leave the tribe to found new tribes. This apparently declines</i><br>
<i>&gt;in most people as they age and become settled, but it might be possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;extend it (an idealism supplement?), which would probably be very healthy to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do from time to time to prevent mental aging.</i><br>
Is there any hormones that we know of that control this? or any ideas? Is<br>
there something psychological that can stop us from becoming settled. The<br>
elders of this newsgroup must have something different about them that the<br>
rest of the world settles while they keep marching ahead into new undefined<br>
unexplored territory.<br>
