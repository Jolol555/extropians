Is sex a form of parallel communication?  Chris Hind wants to know.<br>
<p>
Well, that depends.  But if you have the genitals sliding down there, the <br>
tounges playing across each other up here, hands carressing the back, moving <br>
through the hair on the head,  bodies gliding against each other, engaged in <br>
an ecstatic dance, each moving and responding the the actions of the other, I <br>
would call it parallel communication, since there is so much being <br>
communicated simultaneously.<br>
