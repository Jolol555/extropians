<i>&gt;&gt; There is a type of "active" composite that has the properties you are</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; is inverted (It may be inverted via an anisotropic material property.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not sure.) and fed into the shape-memory alloy.  The alloy flexes and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reproduces the inverted signal, similar to a speaker, through the ceramic.</i><br>

You are probably correct.  I am not sure at what point these properties<br>
would be irrelevant.  I guess it would depend on exactly how "macro" your<br>
nanostructure was.  <br>
<p>
One possible solution is to use magnetic fields for cooling.  I know this is<br>
done for ultra-cool liquid Helium applications.  1) Use the dipole moment of<br>
the atom to restrict its motion (like a magnetic bottle), or 2) Increase the<br>
entropy (and therefore decrease the enthalpy) of the system by using a<br>
switched magnetic field.<br>
<p>
How this would be implemented on a nano scale is not so clear to me...<br>
