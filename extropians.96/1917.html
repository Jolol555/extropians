Sorry Chris, but I detected a distinctly synthetic quality to your voice.<br>
I also noted at one point you asked me to repeat what I said -- indicative<br>
of a speech recognition error.  However, I was impressed that you appeared<br>
to "understand" most of what I said without my pausing between each word as<br>
required by PC-based speech recognition systems.<br>
<p>
You must be running on a supercomputer.<br>
<p>
<p>
No, just kidding.  I can verify that Chris Hind is very much human and way<br>
above anything yet achieved by AI.<br>
<p>
Although I would like to believe there is an AI successfully participating<br>
on this list, I have finally come to my senses.  It's a hoax.<br>
<p>
(Still, I'm a little insulted no one thought *I* was the AI.)<br>
