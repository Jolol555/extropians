I don't think "the public" has a perception of extropians. A small<br>
percentage of the population has varying perceptions of us. Those who read<br>
the Wired article (or many others) probably have far more positive<br>
perceptions than some of those who read Dery's book. I received over 400<br>
e-mail messages as a result of the Wired article. The tone, almost without<br>
exception, ranged from curious to wildly enthusiastic. Many readers of<br>
Dery's book will see through his interpretation. This has happened before.<br>
I've seen it happen numerous times with cryonics -- a negative story<br>
generates inquiries from people who want to check things out for themselves.<br>
<p>
Dery's book is merely one source. Mentions of Extropians, including<br>
interviews with them, appear all over, giving an entirely different=<br>
 impression.<br>

<p>
Very wrong I would say. Is there anyone here *except* Lyle who serious<br>
entertains fantasies of destroying the world? Doesn't sound like many<br>
extropians I know. (Okay, I can think of one or two who might feel that<br>
way!) Generally extropians I'm acquainted with care about their personal<br>
transcendence and that of anyone who seeks it too. Some of them seem to be<br>
concerned to encourage "the masses" to come along too -- sometimes for the<br>
pragmatic reason that the more extropians there are, the faster progress<br>
will be (and the more interesting people there will be to communicate and<br>
trade with). Being transhuman is a positive-sum game, not a negative one.<br>
<p>

<p>
Look, let's keep things in perspective. Hans is *not* planning on killing<br>
billions of people. He is intent on creating mind children far superior<br>
intellectually and physically to today's humans. He sees many humans<br>
enjoying (at least for a time) leisure thanks to machines. Those humans who<br>
choose it can join the posthumans. Those who don't, in Moravec's scenario,<br>
*may* eventually be consumed, but then again they may not be as the<br>
posthumans and mind children leave for space. Whatever the particular<br>
scenario, it's not as if Hans is plotting to personally destroy anyone. I<br>
think he's saying eventually the choice will be to become posthuman or<br>
*risk* dying out (which is any human's fate anyway in a few decades). This<br>
isn't quite as monstrous as you make out.<br>
<p>
But Moravec's scenario is not necessarily the way things will actually<br>
happen. I thing he's quite wrong about what's likely. Like many extropians,<br>
I'd like to encourage more humans to prepare, to continuously upgrade<br>
themselves, so that the odds of the nasty possibilities are minimized.<br>
