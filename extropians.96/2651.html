Actually, it was this Michael, not the other.<br>

<i>&gt; Absolutely! But taking our own scarcity along won't get us far.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We certainly need a lot of diverse, life sustaining  technology. And all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of the bag of tricks we can muster to keep us alive on an offworld</i><br>
<i>&gt; colony. I dont think it's going to be like in Star Trek where all the planets</i><br>
<i>&gt; have air we can breathe and humanoids who speak English 100% ; - )</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is all I meant by directing the attention to what we can do here and</i><br>
<i>&gt; now. Of course we want options, lots of options...</i><br>
<p>
Actually, if you do some web surfing, use AltaVista to look up<br>
"Extrasolar;Planets" and you will learn about all the planets we are<br>
discovering. It turns out that planets seem to be a natural phenomenon<br>
of just about every sun-like star, though less likely with binary<br>
systems. From this, it seems pretty likely that inhabitable, oxygen<br>
atmophere, water ocean worlds will be pretty common.<br>
<p>
Also, the dominant form of biological life will be based on carbon, like<br>
we are. THe next best element as a replacement is silicon, has less than<br>
50% of the versatility chemically as carbon, so is less likely to be<br>
used. However, DNA may not neccessarily be the form of building bioware.<br>
A star with a bit too much ultraviolet light output would simply<br>
scramble DNA too much to be of use, unless you had an environment like<br>
Seven Day Planet where massive reproduction, high metabolic rates, and<br>
high rates of evolution would be the norm.<br>
<p>
Additionally, though I can't promise English speaking, for obvious<br>
reasons (though with augmentation, maybe even a fish in the ear ;),<br>
universal translators "may" be possible), i read a recent study of<br>
likely forms of intelligent aliens. According to the analysis of<br>
evolutionary behavior, the humanoid form is the most likely to be<br>
intelligent, though not necessarily mammalian or even human features,<br>
but the bipedal, two eyes and ears, two to four arms, and four to six<br>
fingered hand, who is omnivorous. Of course,this is based on an expected<br>
limited database of how much we think we know about our world, and how<br>
little we know about others.<br>
