Thanks to David Musick for taking the time to explain some details<br>
about the statistics of the shooting room paradox.  While I don't<br>
agree 100% with everything he said, it did shed a lot of light on<br>
how some things would work.<br>
<p>
In particular, David has convinced me that if people are selected<br>
for the room not at random, but in a fixed order, and if you know<br>
your position in that ordering, then you will in fact have a 1/36<br>
chance of seeing doubles when you go into the room.<br>
<p>
However there is another interesting question to ask about what you will<br>
see in the room, supposing you are chosen at random: how many people are<br>
expected to be in there with you?  I find the answer rather surprising:<br>
infinity.<br>
<p>
There should be, on average, an infinite number of people in the room<br>
with you.<br>
<p>
I think this result further establishes that the paradoxical aspect of<br>
the shooting room relies on the presence of infinities.  Once you have<br>
infinite sets involved much of our intuition goes out the window.<br>
<p>
Without this realization, I think you still have a paradox, as with the<br>
following argument:<br>
<p>
A) Everyone who goes into the room has an equal chance of seeing double<br>
sixes rolled.<br>
<p>
B) 90% of the people who go into the room see double sixes.<br>
<p>
If you didn't have infinite sets, I think these two facts in and of<br>
themselves will serve to prove that the probability of an individual<br>
randomly chosen from those who go into the room seeing double sixes<br>
is 90%.  The probability of an event is defined to be the limit, as the<br>
number of trials approaches infinity, of the fraction of trials in which<br>
the event occurs.  If we repeat our experiment a large number of times,<br>
the fraction of the selected people for whom the event "sees double sixes"<br>
occurs will approach 90%.  It follows, by the definition of probability,<br>
that the probability of a person randomly chosen for the experiment<br>
seeing double sixes is 90%.<br>
<p>
(David suggested that this reasoning was invalid because different people<br>
would be chosen each time.  However this is not a reason to reject this<br>
argument.  When we say that a radioactive substance is such that 10%<br>
of its nuclei will decay in time T, then if we repeat the experiment<br>
a different 10% will decay.  Yet even though the specific nuclei were<br>
different in each case, we would not hesitate to say that each nucleus<br>
faces a 10% chance of decay in time T.  The issue of whether the same<br>
nuclei are involved each time is not relevant.)<br>
<p>
However, with infinite numbers involved things are more complicated.<br>
The conditional probability of A given B, written as p(A|B), can be<br>
expressed as p(A&amp;B)/p(B); the probability of both A and B occuring,<br>
divided by the probability of B occuring.  If A is "sees double sixes" and<br>
B is "selected for the experiment", then p(A&amp;B) is the chance that a given<br>
person will be both selected for the experiment and see double sixes,<br>
while p(B) is the chance that he will be selected for the experiment.<br>
p(A|B) is what we are interested in, the chance that someone selected<br>
for the experiment will see double sixes.<br>
<p>
With infinite sets, though, p(B) is 0, and p(A&amp;B) is 0.  So p(A|B) is 0/0,<br>
which is indeterminate.  It is no wonder then that different reasoning<br>
leads to different results.  We really can't apply simple arguments like<br>
these to infinite sets and expect reasonable answers.<br>
