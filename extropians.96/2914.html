In reply to my statement, <br>
<p>
* Coming back to the original point:  You were saying that there is a<br>
* causal relationship between (a) the fact that government agencies don't<br>
* need to create happy customers, and (b) the level of rudeness in those<br>
* agencies.  If people were rational, this causal relationship would exist,<br>
* but in fact (in my experience at least) it doesn't exist.  I have found<br>
* just as much rudeness, if not more, in department stores, drug stores,<br>
* restaurants, and other businesses, even though they can't afford to lose<br>
* customers.  It is a mistake to assume that people are more rational than<br>
* they are.<br>

<i>&gt; But you ignored my third and most important point: </i><br>
<i>&gt;  c) because government has a heavily enforced monopoly, </i><br>
<i>&gt; one cannot take ones need for services elsewhere, </i><br>
<i>&gt; while with private business, one can go next door </i><br>
<i>&gt; if one feels like they are not getting the level of service they deserve. </i><br>
<p>
That's not a different point, that's just a fuller statement of (a).  <br>
<p>
Let's also give a fuller statement of (b), as follows:  <br>
<p>
(b)  Government employees NEVER treat the public like human beings, <br>
but private businesses generally do.  <br>
<p>
As I understand it, your argument is:  (c), therefore (b).  <br>
<p>
I'm saying that even though (c) is true, the predicted effect (b) has not <br>
been observed, at least not in my experience.  People in businesses, <br>
including small shops, are insulting and spiteful whenever they feel like <br>
it, even though they know perfectly well that offended customers will <br>
go elsewhere.  <br>
<p>
In my experience, rudeness has been a random phenomenon:  <br>
I have been treated well by people who could have treated me like shit <br>
and gotten away with it, and I have been treated like shit by people <br>
who were only hurting themselves by doing so.  <br>
<p>
The constraint of the marketplace must have *some* effect, but <br>
it sure isn't apparent to me.  <br>

<i>&gt; Lyle, if we separate state agencies like IRS, INS, and the rest, </i><br>
<i>&gt; from government services, would you say state agencies were ruder </i><br>
<i>&gt; than private businesses?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe so.  I have heard (can it be true?) that IRS agents are generally <br>
not as nice as teachers and librarians.  But I couldn't say from my own <br>
experience.  I've never had any contact with INS, and my only contact <br>
with IRS has been through the mail.  My policy about taxes has always <br>
been:  they can have my money, but they can't have my time.  I have <br>
never been audited, because my tax returns are so simple there is really <br>
nothing to audit.  <br>
<p>
Some people on the list, such as Davin Enigl and James Rogers, <br>
seem to have had extensive experience with federal agencies.  Maybe <br>
we should get some input from them.  <br>
<p>
If you are going to make a distinction between agencies like IRS and <br>
agencies which provide services, then you are going to have to make a <br>
corresponding distinction between different kinds of private businesses.  <br>
Compare IRS with collection agencies, slumlords, used-car salesmen in <br>
blue-collar neighborhoods, doormen and deejays at certain nightclubs, <br>
paparazzi, crack dealers, pimps...   Not all private businesses have the <br>
same standards of gentility that one finds in a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore.  <br>
