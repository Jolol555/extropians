I'm not quite clear as to what analogy is being drawn.  It seems to me<br>
that the # of people is relevant only because given the rules, it tells<br>
you what stage of the game you're at, which is all you want to know.  If<br>
you're early in the game, you can't tell which rule is being used; if<br>
you're at stage 40, it is more likely that the 1/36 chance is being<br>
used.  Back analogy: if there have been many chances for noticeable life<br>
before us, our future odds are bad; if not, we can't tell.  But I'm not<br>
sure this is the same as the above problem.  It seems more useful,<br>
though.<br>
