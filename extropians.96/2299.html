        Of all governmental outrages, perhaps none is as <br>
        illogical, tyrannical, inhumane and fallacy founded <br>
        as is the prohibition of the god-given herb cannabis, <br>
        also know as "marijuana."<br>
<p>
        With a referendum for medical cannabis access on the <br>
        ballot in California, Proposition 215, politicians are <br>
        back in the news claiming once again that cannabis has <br>
        NO medical value and thus access to it must be barred <br>
        by force. The following freely flowing fountain of <br>
        facts lays this government funded pharmacological <br>
        fraud to rest forever.<br>
<p>
<p>
        CANNABIS: THE MEDICAL REALITY<br>
<p>
        Classified by the DEA as a "Schedule One" drug, <br>
        cannabis is defined as extremely dangerous possessing <br>
        NO KNOWN MEDICAL VALUE. This classification stands <br>
        in sharp contradiction to reality.<br>
<p>
        A Brief History of Medical Cannabis<br>
<p>
        For thousands of years prior to its prohibition in<br>
        the 20th century, cannabis was used as a medicine <br>
        throughout the world [1]. During the 19th century, <br>
        sold by major drug companies such as Eli Lilly, <br>
        Squibb, Parke-Davis, Smith Brothers, and Tildens, <br>
        the potent extract of cannabis was one of the<br>
        top three most prescribed medical agents in the <br>
        United States [2] [3]. <br>
<p>
        Until the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act, cannabis, being a <br>
        powerful topical analgesic, muscle relaxant, anti-<br>
        inflammatory, and anti-spasmodic agent, was found <br>
        in virtually all fistulas, corn and mustard plasters,<br>
        muscle ointments, and fibrosis poultices [3]. <br>
<p>
        UNITED STATES PHARMACOPEIA listed cannabis until<br>
        1942 [4], after which it was removed under political  <br>
        pressure. The U.S. PHARMACOPEIA recommended cannabis<br>
        for the treatment of over 100 illnesses, such as:<br>
        fatigue, fits of coughing, rheumatism, asthma, <br>
        delirium tremens, migraine headaches, and the cramps<br>
        and depression associated with menstruation [3].<br>
<p>
        UNITED STATES DISPENSATORY [5] also listed cannabis <br>
        as a useful medicine. The 1851 edition states:<br>
<p>
             The complaints in which it [cannabis] has <br>
             been specially recommended are neuralgia,<br>
             gout, rheumatism, tetanus, hyrdophobia, <br>
             epidemic cholera, convulsions, chorea, <br>
             hysteria, mental depression, delirium <br>
             tremens, insanity and uterine hemorrhage. <br>
        <br>
        In 1890, Dr. J. Russell Reynolds, Fellow of the Royal <br>
        Society and the Physician in Order to Her Majesty's <br>
        Household, stated in the journal LANCET that cannabis <br>
        is ``one of the most valuable medicines we possess [4].'' <br>
        He prescribed cannabis to Queen Victoria for PMS [3].<br>
<p>
        In 1898 Sir William Osler, Professor of Medicine at the <br>
        University of Oxford, stated that for migraine headaches, <br>
        cannabis ``is probably the most satisfactory remedy [6].'' <br>
<p>
        The 1931 medical text, A MODERN HERBAL [7], states:<br>
<p>
             The principal use of Hemp in medicine is <br>
             for easing pain and inducing sleep, and for <br>
             soothing influences in nervous disorders. <br>
             It is useful in neuralgia, gout, rheumatism,  <br>
             delirium tremens, insanity, infantile <br>
             convulsions, insomnia, etc. <br>
<p>
             The tincture helps parturition, and is used <br>
             in senile catarrh, gonorrhea, menorrhagia, <br>
             chronic cystitis and  painful urinary <br>
             affections. An infusion of the seed is useful <br>
             in after pains and prolapsus uteri. The resin <br>
             may be combined with ointments [ to remedy ] <br>
             inflammatory and neuralgic complaints. <br>
<p>
        The "no known medical value" claim looks like yet <br>
        another govt Big Lie. However, as the text continues, <br>
        we can see that cannabis does have an "evil" downside:<br>
<p>
             It can produce an exhilarating intoxication... <br>
             hence its names ... 'increaser of  pleasure,' <br>
             'cementer of friendship,' etc. [ god forbid ]<br>
<p>
<p>
        Medical Cannabis: the 20th Century<br>
<p>
        During the 20th century cannabis has been discovered <br>
        to be an effective treatment for many more ailments. <br>
        For example, based on major research, Dr. Van Sim <br>
        concluded that  ``marijuana ... is probably the most <br>
        potent anti-epileptic known to medicine today [8].'' <br>
        More powerful than standard anti-epileptic drugs, <br>
        cannabis totally eliminated epileptic seizures in <br>
        children not responding to legal drug therapies [9]. <br>
<p>
        But of course, as our benevolent Drug Czars remind us, <br>
        healing the sick and aiding those who suffer could <br>
        "send the wrong message to children." Let the children<br>
        suffer and seizure in silence, just don't kill our<br>
        prison proliferating pot prohibition pogrom.<br>
<p>
        Dr. Robert Hepler, neuro-opthalmologist with the Jules<br>
        Stein Eye Institute at UCLA, published a major study <br>
        in the JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION <br>
        in 1971 demonstrating that cannabis lowers intraocular <br>
        pressure in the eyes [10]. Glaucoma, a leading cause <br>
        of blindness, is a condition in which intraocular <br>
        pressures build up causing optical damage. Cannabis  <br>
        has been proven to reduce these pressures far better <br>
        than legal drugs, allowing glaucoma patients to keep <br>
        their vision so long as they use cannabis regularly. <br>
<p>
        Several of the eight patients who legally receive <br>
        cannabis from the govt under the compassionate IND <br>
        program do so for the treatment of glaucoma. Yet, <br>
        thanks to cannabis prohibition and the fact that no <br>
        more patients will be allowed into the compassionate <br>
        IND program, most glaucoma patients will be forced by <br>
        law to slowly go blind, all in the name of keeping <br>
        peaceful and productive people in prison.<br>
<p>
        Research at the Harvard Medical School published in <br>
        the NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE [11] demonstrated <br>
        conclusively that cannabis is the most effective anti-<br>
        emetic, or anti-nausea, agent available. It has been <br>
        used in this regard to eliminate the violent nausea <br>
        and vomiting experienced by cancer patents undergoing <br>
        chemotherapy. Cancer ward workers have been known to <br>
        turn a blind-eye on cannabis smoking in the hospital.<br>
<p>
        Based on extensive anecdotal evidence, cannabis, with <br>
        its known appetite-stimulating effects -- described by <br>
        users as "getting the munchies" -- is known to counter <br>
        the "wasting syndrome" of full-blown AIDS. During this <br>
        syndrome an AIDS patient, loosing all appetite, quickly <br>
        loses weight in a free-fall to death.  In case after <br>
        case, AIDS patients have totally reversed their weight <br>
        loss with the use of cannabis, snatching them from the <br>
        quickly closing jaws of death, giving them a powerful <br>
        fighting edge over this devastating disease.<br>
<p>
        Yet the Department of Health and Human Services, which <br>
        oversees the compassionate IND program, chose to slam <br>
        the door on hope by ending this program after receiving <br>
        a flood of cannabis-access requests from AIDS patients.  <br>
        <br>
        The DEA and other agencies funded studies at the <br>
        Medical College of Virginia looking for evidence that <br>
        cannabis causes health problems.  Instead of finding<br>
        problems, the researchers made a breakthrough when <br>
        they discovered in 1975 that cannabis showed powerful <br>
        anti-tumor activity against both benign and malignant <br>
        tumors. The DEA and NIH quickly defunded the studies <br>
        and prohibited any future cannabis/tumor research [3].<br>
        <br>
        In 1988 the DEA's own conservative judge, Francis <br>
        Young, after hearing medical testimony for 15 days <br>
        and reviewing hundreds of DEA and NIDA documents that <br>
        argued against medical cannabis, concluded that [3]: <br>
<p>
          ``Marijuana is one of the safest therapeutically <br>
                  active substances know to man.'' <br>
<p>
        Nevertheless, even in light of the overwhelming body <br>
        of evidence proving beyond doubt that cannabis is <br>
        medically safe and effective, DEA Director John Lawn <br>
        ignored Judge Young's advice and decreed that cannabis <br>
        remain classified as a Schedule One drug -- extremely <br>
        harmful and useless. This official classification is <br>
        a pharmacological fraud fodded off by govt force.<br>
<p>
        The medical wisdom of the ages and hope for the future <br>
        crushed under the brute-force of tyrannical govt power. <br>
        That is the face of tyranny. Let the sick and blind  <br>
        suffer and slowly die that the police state, its  <br>
        bloated bureaucrats and people-pulverizing prisons <br>
        might prosper and proliferate like a plague. Such <br>
        is the victory of evil over good.<br>
<p>
        California voters, however, have an opportunity this<br>
        November 5th to strike a blow against evil and score <br>
        a victory for good by voting YES on Proposition 215.<br>
