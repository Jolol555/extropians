<i>&gt;&gt; I had the same experience, at about the same age (21-22), but without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the drugs.  I'm 30 now, and am not nearly "as smart" as I was when I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; was 20.  The main effect has been concentration: I used to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; concentrate for hours at a shot.  Now, while I'm not a poster-fella</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; for ADD, I sure can't.  I can't even concentrate for 5 minutes any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; more. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Strange.  Is this always true, no matter what you are doing?  Maybe </i><br>
<i>&gt;you are trying to concentrate on things that don't really interest you.    </i><br>
<p>
Hm.  Not really, although I often need to concentrate on things that<br>
frustrate the hell out of me!  No, I really think it's a true<br>
phenomenon.  I also find it when listening to music.  I'm a huge music<br>
fan (see my fledgling web pages at <a href="http://www-kzsu.stanford.edu/~everett/">http://www-kzsu.stanford.edu/~everett/</a>). <br>
I used to be able to listen for hours straight with complete<br>
comcentration.  Now my mind is cluttered with a million things, many<br>
of which are not really that important but that concern/irritate me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe you should use drugs!  Abstinence affects different people in </i><br>
<i>&gt;different ways.  &lt;g&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
I never have, except alcohol.  I've always felt that I was a such a<br>
compulsive person that it was really dangerous for me to try.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I certainly agree about the e-mail, but it's a hard habit to break.    </i><br>
<p>
Yeah.  331 messages left to read tonight. . .<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I was 35 I started playing a video game.  I became obsessed with </i><br>
<i>&gt;it.  I would play for hours at a time.  This could be considered a form of </i><br>
<i>&gt;meditation.  The game required very fast eye-hand coordination (with </i><br>
<i>&gt;both hands), and it required intense visual concentration -- not on an </i><br>
<i>&gt;unchanging pattern, as in some forms of meditation, but on a moving </i><br>
<i>&gt;pattern, which was just what I needed.   The breakthrough came about </i><br>
<i>&gt;six months after I started playing the game.  Something snapped </i><br>
<i>&gt;one afternoon, and that was when I started getting my strength back.  </i><br>
<p>
Has anyone here read those books by Micael Somthing, author of "Flow"?<br>
 From the description of his books, he seems to be onto something.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you find something -- anything -- that utterly fascinates you, </i><br>
<i>&gt;something you can do for hours and never think about the time, that </i><br>
<i>&gt;would probably be a cure, or at least the first step towards a cure.  </i><br>
<p>
That's an excellent thought, thanks.<br>
