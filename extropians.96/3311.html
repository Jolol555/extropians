Network Trading<br>
<p>
<p>
In the future, economic transactions won't likely be fundamentally different <br>
than they are today.  People will almost certainly still have goods and <br>
services they agree to trade with each other.  However, I believe that the <br>
average person will be engaging in much more trade than ever before, and I <br>
believe that the marketplace will be much more fluid and dynamic than it ever <br>
has been.<br>
<p>
As computer networks become more widespread and powerful, it is becoming much <br>
easier to find  the right people to trade with.  For example, many people are <br>
selling their products by advertising through the Internet and by exchanging <br>
money through the computer networks.  When one wishes to purchase a particular <br>
product, one can ask the computer to perform a search of the Internet to find <br>
the people who are selling whatever product one is interested in.  Computer <br>
networks are excellent tools for matching up buyer and seller, and they will <br>
become more widespread as more people recognize their value and use the <br>
computer networks routinely.  In the future, if I want to sell some product or <br>
some service, I will announce that through the computer networks, and the <br>
people who are interested in what I offer will be directed to me to negotiate <br>
a trade.  Likewise, if I wish to purchase something, the computer networks <br>
will direct me to the appropriate list of people.<br>
<p>
The widespread use of computer networks will make it much easier to be <br>
self-employed and contract one's services and talents out to those who offer <br>
an agreeable trade, much like a free lance artist does.  It will become less <br>
necessary to have a "steady job", where one trades with the same person day <br>
after day, and it will become easier and more secure for someone to have <br>
several clients that they work for and multiple streams of income, so they are <br>
not dependent on any single source of income.<br>
<p>
If one is interested in completing a very large and complex project, such as <br>
building and maintaining hydroponic greenhouses, then one will want to <br>
organize teams of people to work on this project.  One could first hire a team <br>
of engineers to plan the project and organize it into sub-projects.  Then one <br>
could hire teams and individuals to complete the various sub-projects until <br>
the greenhouses are built and food is being grown in them.  Then one would <br>
receive requests for food and hire people to transport the food to the <br>
appropriate places.  This is not fundamentally any different than what has <br>
been done for thousands of years now.  People have been organizing companies <br>
and groups to complete projects for quite a long time.  Now it's becoming a <br>
lot easier for the average person to do, because computer networks are helping <br>
to lower the costs of organizing a business.<br>
<p>
I predict that as computer networks become more widespread and their use <br>
becomes commonplace, a very large percentage of people will be taking <br>
advantage of this technology to make their economic lives extremely flexible, <br>
dynamic and lucrative.  I predict that it will become increasingly less common <br>
for someone to have a "steady job".  That concept seems radical now, because <br>
there aren't so many secure alternatives for employment than working for the <br>
same person day after day.  However, I believe this will change within a few <br>
years, and it will seem foolish and dangerous to have only one major client <br>
that one is dependent on for income.<br>
<p>
I believe that people will become much more "project oriented" than they are <br>
today.  I think people will look at employment more in terms of working on a <br>
particular project than they do now.  People will hire other people to <br>
complete particular projects or tasks, and when the project is done or the <br>
task is completed, they will each go their own way.  As a project manager, you <br>
may find someone who consistently does excellent work, and you may hire them <br>
regularly to work on various projects, and this will probably be common.  But <br>
that same person will likely have many other clients that they work for as <br>
well.  <br>
<p>
I believe that in the future, one's financial situation will more accurately <br>
reflect the quality of work one does and thus be more fair.  Good workers will <br>
develop a good reputation, and there will be a high-paying demand for them, <br>
and they will generally only accept the highest-paying offers for their work.  <br>
Those who don't prove themselves to be such good workers will not receive such <br>
high-paying offers for their work.  Of course, they could always hire someone <br>
to teach them how to improve their skills and become a more excellent worker, <br>
and thus improve their financial situation.  <br>
<p>
Considering human history, it seems that people's economic lives have become <br>
increasingly dynamic and are continuing to become even more flexible.  At one <br>
time, most people were pretty much confined to living in the same village, <br>
doing the same tasks, all their lives.  As we've progressed and developed <br>
large cities, it has become much easier for people to relocate and to change <br>
employers.  Our lives have become much more flexible and filled with more <br>
options.  I believe that the widespread use of computer networks will create <br>
even greater flexibility in people's lives and allow people many more options <br>
for organizing their lives, including greater flexibility of who they work <br>
for.  Technology is providing people the tools they need to take care of <br>
themselves better and manage their own lives.<br>
