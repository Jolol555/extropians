<i>&gt; Sometimes terms like "eternal life" and "immortality" seemed to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; tossed around pretty casually around here.  This is a bit curious to me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since one of the main driving forces behind my leaving Xtianity (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; ultimately bumping into transhumanism)that the idea of truly eternal</i><br>
<i>&gt; life ceased to automatically be appealing or even make any sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         What do I mean, it doesn't make sense?  Eternal life and</i><br>
<i>&gt; immortality as traditionally conceived refer to infinities. (I'm using</i><br>
<i>&gt; "eternal" in its temporal, rather than atemporal, sense). Everybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this list is certainly well acquainted with the fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between an infinite quantitity and a finite quantity, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter how large.  An infinity is as different from a finite quantity as</i><br>
<i>&gt; any finite quantity is from a zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         To make a not exactly logical leap here, it seems equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious that an infinite (or semi-infinite) lifespan is as different</i><br>
<i>&gt; from any finite lifespan as a finite lifespan is from never existing at</i><br>
<i>&gt; all.  Theologians have long recognized this difficulty.  Unfortunately,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the answers they give tend to boil down to the most intellectually</i><br>
<i>&gt; dishonest trick in their arsenal: It's beyond human understanding.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         What I want to know is, how many of you want real eternal life</i><br>
<i>&gt; as opposed to an indefinite lifespan? (The difference here is a fuzzy</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of these wonderings, but the real difficulties that come with</i><br>
<i>&gt; eternal life don't seem to be a problem with indefinite lifespans.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; For those of you who do, how do you conceive of such an existence?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Much has been written in extropian circles about how one can</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaningfully retain one's identity while vastly augmenting one's mental</i><br>
<i>&gt; capabilities.  It seems to me that if one proposes truly eternal life,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the task must be at least partially repeated to justify a claim to being</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same person, living eternally.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         As to myself, I'm inclined towards a bit despair (not very</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian, for sure.)  Some form of atemporality seems the best option,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but this is really fuzzy territory.</i><br>

I guess to me, since none of you existed before I was born, and none of<br>
you will exist to me when I'm dead, then I already have eternal life as<br>
much as can be, as the universe only exists for me for my whole life.<br>
Unfortunately, I don't seem to have enough eternal life coming to me<br>
(probably only 70 more years) unless I do something about it.  We wish<br>
to live as much life as we want to. When we have no more need of life,<br>
its our choice to end it.<br>
