Roderick A. Carder-Russell wrote, "Emotions serve a variety of functions and <br>
are not the mystical entities that David Musick makes them out to be.  He <br>
states "How about feelings?  Logic is not the only thing that drives us.", <br>
giving the impression that he views feelings as something "beyond" logic and <br>
reason and not subject to the same rules.  If<br>
I misinterpreted you David, I apologize..."<br>
<p>
Hold on just a second here...  That's not my quote.  I never wrote "How about <br>
feelings?  Logic is not the only thing that drives us."  That quote was from <br>
Max M. Rasmussen, which he wrote in response to my query about whether it is <br>
possible to develop a system of rational ethics.  Just to set the record <br>
straight (although it should have been unnecessary if *someone* would have <br>
taken the time to read their e-mail carefully!), I don't make anything out to <br>
be mystical; in fact, I have strong feelings against doing so.  I prefer to <br>
find logical reasons for everything and keep probing deeper, to understand how <br>
things really are.  I currently believe that emotions are of the same basic <br>
nature that logic and rationality are; they are certain types of thinking.<br>
