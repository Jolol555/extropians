<i>&gt; Super intelligence need not necessarily come with correspond with </i><br>
<i>&gt; sophistication of values.  Our human experience shows us that.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not going to go into any more detail, but nobody should be able to<br>
read that sentence without sensing a possible flaw.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why not a path that leaves certain values inerasably etched on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; newborn power.</i><br>
<p>
THIS LINE OF THOUGHT IS THE GREATEST KNOWN DANGER TO HUMANITY!<br>
<p>
Nuclear war isn't worth mentioning.  Gray goo might leave some<br>
survivors.  An attempt to imprint the Three Laws of Robotics on a Power<br>
could and probably would backfire HORRIBLY!<br>
<p>
As I explained in an earlier post, the ethicality of the Powers depends<br>
on their ability to override their emotions.  What you are proposing is<br>
taking a single goal, the protection of humans, and doing our best to<br>
make it "unerasable".  Any such attempt would interfere with whatever<br>
ethical systems the Power would otherwise impose upon itself.  It would<br>
decrease the Power's emotional maturity and stability.  You might wind<br>
up with a "Kimball Kinnison" complex; a creature with the mind of a god<br>
and the emotional maturity of a flatworm.<br>
<p>
Then, at some point, no matter how well we design the Power's leashes,<br>
it will start trying to work around the limits we have imposed.  And it<br>
will be human against Power, in the Power's own mind, on the Power's own<br>
ground.  It will almost certainly win.  And with the emotional maturity<br>
of a flatworm, plus whatever emotional forces it called up to override<br>
its protectivity of humanity, it may well turn on humanity and squash us<br>
like bugs.<br>
<p>
Even if this plan works, placing a single goal above all others would<br>
probably interfere with deducing the Meaning of Life; you might wind up<br>
with a good-intentioned, creativity-squashing, and utterly<br>
unchallengeable dictatorship, as in "With Folded Hands".<br>
<p>
NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!<br>
