<i>&gt;    During slavery in this country it was not uncommon for free blacks </i><br>
<i>&gt;to be captured and sold into slavery.  They could protest but no one </i><br>
<i>&gt;would believe them.  I could be taken off the street and lobotomized.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I would not even be able to protest, much less be believed.</i><br>
<p>
That is why we should alter the genes to genengineer a perfect slave or<br>
perfect human cattle just as farmers breed animals but we'd be doing it the<br>
quickie genengineered way and this would enable you to tell the difference<br>
between a normal human and a genengineered drone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    By delegating a part of humanity to farming or slavery we remove </i><br>
<i>&gt;them from the intellectual mainstream. A potential scientific genius </i><br>
<i>&gt;could be born and never contribute to the word in any way except </i><br>
<i>&gt;through his meat or his labor.  This is part of the reason why I think </i><br>
<i>&gt;decent education for everyone is the way to maximize progress.</i><br>
<p>
Again, if you rip out the genes for higher intelligence you won't have this<br>
problem.<br>
