Because that would be false. Not all high technology and its use is<br>
desirable from an extropian persepective. Using advanced technology to<br>

Eliezer, you've managed to go off an irrelevant path. The definition is for<br>
"extropy", not for "Extropian" nor for "extropian". Extropians are those who<br>
consciously seek to increase their extropy and who see this as a desirable<br>
goal, and who do so with some philosophical awareness. The definition does<br>
not say that self-described Extropians are necessarily higher in personal<br>
extropy. So, your points miss the mark.<br>
