Subject: The Conspiracy Theory THEY Want You to Believe<br>
<p>
	I have been mulling over an article on this topic for years.<br>
<p>
	Of course, there may well have been many such conspiracy theories<br>
floated by various factions of the Establishment over the years.  However,<br>
I am looking for the essence of the one that has served them consistently<br>
for the long term.<br>
<p>
	My best hypothesis is the Class Warfare conspiracy, essentially as<br>
formalized by Noam Chomsky and recently bought into by Daniel Brandt in<br>
his NameBase Newsline which we broadcasted to the Weekly Up-date List and<br>
a number of News Groups.<br>
<p>
	While the real ruling class is a tiny cabal centered around the<br>
Federal Reserve System with International connections to the British<br>
Oligarchy and their International Banking network, the Class Warfare<br>
theorists would have us believe that a Conspiracy of the "rich", usually<br>
those making over $100,000.00/year or about 10% of the population,<br>
who organize themselves primarily through the Republican Party to despoil<br>
"working people" by lowering taxes on themselves and cutting social<br>
programs.  The real ruling class has their wealth in tax free Foundations<br>
or sheltered/secreted in Switzerland or other bank secrecy havens and are<br>
situated in truly Olympian fashion with enormous leverage through<br>
anonymous control of hundreds of the world largest corporations.<br>
<p>
	To maintain their lofty perch the real ruling class must prevent<br>
that 10% of society making decent incomes above $100,000.00 from getting<br>
much richer.  They don't need to be 100% successful in this endeavor, but<br>
need only keep the frequency of big money breakthroughs to a manageable<br>
level.  A few big money breakthroughs are no problem.  "Co-operative" new<br>
rich can be gradually integrated into their cabal through such front<br>
organizations as the Council on Foreign Relations and a few<br>
"uncooperative" new rich can be eliminated through selective enforcement<br>
of all pervasive "regulations" or, if necessary, more dramatic action.  As<br>
Ferdinand Lundberg pointed-out in his crucial book there are _The Rich and<br>
the Super Rich_!  The primary enemies of the Super Rich are not the poor,<br>
but the Rich!  In classic Caesarian/fascist fashion, the Super Rich, to<br>
remain at the helm of society as a whole, must organize the poor against<br>
their real competitors, the Rich.<br>
<p>
	Thus, we see the constant drumbeat in the press that taxes must be<br>
raised or certainly not reduced on the upper 10% of incomes.  This<br>
propaganda is repeated endlessly in the CFR's _Foreign Affairs_ as well.<br>
<p>
	[Obviously, there is much more that I could and will eventually<br>
write about this topic....comments pro and con at this point would be<br>
appreciated.]<br>
<p>
PS.  Yes, I am quite aware that this theory is not unique to me.  Gary<br>
Allen called it "pressure from above and pressure from below" in his<br>
durable _None Dare Call It Conspiracy_.  Gary Allen before his death from<br>
the complications of diabetes, was the John Birch Society's most prolific<br>
writer and the most libertarian as well.<br>
