        I realize that most of the people who read these lists are not<br>
terribly interested in art, but I think that most should enjoy these two<br>
poems.  Before I post, let me just say this: judge them for what they are<br>
worth, not how they are 'supposed' to be viewed.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Paradise Ol=E9<br>
<p>
<p>
I=92m far away from Xanadu and I know no pleasure domes<br>
But I have my immortality within my chromosomes<br>
My mind, my eyes, my heart and soul guide me on my way<br>
To where my stomach=92s always full of melons and Paradise au lait<br>
<p>
The starkest consciousness within the mind shall always have a light<br>
To prove to the rest of my body and world that things will be alright<br>
The knowledge of potential, forever kinetic, helps me see my goal<br>
Total ownership of the person within me: the unity to make my essence whole<br>
<p>
It has always been within me<br>
The ability to go my own way<br>
The path to all eternity<br>
My Paradise au lait<br>
<p>
Cascading obscurities and aging maturities all lead to future shock<br>
But the keys of wisdom and introspect will open omnipotence=92s lock<br>
And when the world has lost all sense of liberty, when freedom seems=<br>
 obsolete<br>
The ones who will survive regression=92s woes will be the ones who don=92t<br>
accept defeat<br>
<p>
The power within is ever so great, so much greater than the power without<br>
And the decision to decide between freedom and faith leaves little room for<br>
doubt<br>
The world is in the hands of who wants it most, the people of true=<br>
 consequence<br>
And the power can be shared by those who have the will to abide by a new<br>
common sense<br>
<p>
It has always been within you<br>
The ability to go your own way<br>
The path to all eternity<br>
Your Paradise au lait<br>
You can use your mind for judgment<br>
Or you can throw your mind away<br>
While I feast on infinity melons<br>
And Paradise au lait<br>

Vary (So Very)<br>
<p>
<p>
I was in a daydream one day<br>
When a question occurred to me<br>
Something just out of my reach<br>
An obscured reality<br>
<p>
I climbed the highest mountain<br>
Scoured the deepest sea<br>
But I couldn=92t find the answer<br>
Couldn=92t fulfill my plea<br>
<p>
I asked the lowliest peasant<br>
With his base philosophy<br>
But he didn=92t have a response<br>
To my crucial inquiry<br>
<p>
I asked the wisest prophet<br>
Within his prophecy<br>
But he couldn=92t reveal the truth<br>
Perhaps he couldn=92t see<br>
<p>
I pleaded with the sky above<br>
Begged God for sympathy<br>
Maybe He wasn=92t listening<br>
Or He was a fallacy<br>
<p>
So in the pits of despair<br>
Depressed as one can be<br>
I looked inside myself<br>
At my wretched anxiety<br>
<p>
And there I found the answer<br>
Of how I could be free<br>
I saw where I went wrong:<br>
I forgot eternity<br>
