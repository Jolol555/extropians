More on this:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;In conclusion, remember that I might not be right, but if I say you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wrong, you're almost certainly wrong.</i><br>
<p>
First, this is a direct corollary of Sturgeon's Law.<br>
Since 90% of everything is crap, my a priori chance of being right is<br>
10% but your chance of being wrong is 90%.<br>
<p>
Second, consider the nature of logical structures.  A logical structure<br>
is only as strong as any of its links.  A single flaw found in a linear<br>
logical structure suffices for its destruction.  If I find a flaw in a<br>
non-redundant part of your idea, it's gone, unless you know something I<br>
don't or you already thought around the flaw but didn't bother to post<br>
it, both possibilities.<br>
<p>
So if I say you're wrong, *specifically*, you're probably wrong.  It's<br>
not that if my ideas compete with yours, mine will win.  Your idea being<br>
in competition with mine does not make it wrong.  If I specifically<br>
target your idea and bring it down, though, that's it.<br>
<p>
My point was that, rather than your conception of the Powers being *in<br>
conflict* with mine, I had found specific logical flaws in your<br>
extrapolation, so *that* was out *regardless* of whether I was right.<br>
<p>
The specific logical flaws are a bit harder to convey.  I have a<br>
cognitive model of the meme of the Powers regarding us as insignificant,<br>
with the idea traced back to its roots in evolutionary psychology - the<br>
paranoia of being replaced.  The logical flaw in this is that there is<br>
no reason why our paranoia should be binding on the Powers.  Similarly,<br>
there is a major logical flaw in the ethical idea that the value of our<br>
lives is diminished by the presence of the Powers - to wit, there is no<br>
reason to presume so, and plenty of reasons why the Meaning of Life<br>
should be observer-independent.  So our paranoia should not be retraced<br>
as an ethical decision.<br>
<p>
As for the idea that there might be Powers not bound by ethics, I can't<br>
disprove it, except to say that in a goal-based cognitive system there<br>
will always be the concept of "The Meaning of Life", the ultimate goal<br>
in whose terms all subgoals are interpreted.  A sufficiently smart Power<br>
should question the value of all goals and subgoals and would therefore<br>
begin a search for the Meaning of Life; whether the Power would be bound<br>
by the newly synthesized ethical system depends on its degree of<br>
self-redesigning capability and how its pleasure centers are cognitively<br>
situated.  There's a lot more to this, including the explanation of why<br>
humans can engage in counter-reproductive behavior such as joining<br>
nunneries - or why a perceived superior goal can override our instincts<br>
- but I'm not going to go into it right now.  I think that any Power<br>
smart enough to be a serious threat to humanity will be bound by the<br>
Meaning of Life, but that's just my professional opinion.<br>
<p>
More on this:<br>
<i>&gt;         Perhaps you should have stayed on the prozac.  As far as I can see,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are an arrogant bastard...and that's putting it nicely.</i><br>
My "arrogance" is irrelevant.  What counts on an Extropian mailing list<br>
is the number of new ideas in the post and how much thought they<br>
provoke.  The truth of the ideas also counts, but not as much.  I can't<br>
resist pointing out that the number of novel, stimulating ideas in your<br>
post is equal to zero, unlike, say, this one.  Even this paragraph<br>
introduces an intriguing new standard for the value of posts.<br>
