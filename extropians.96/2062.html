Chris Hind said: "Human intelligence can practically work around any barrier. <br>
Someday we may even be able to alter the structure of space-time to design <br>
baby universes with us defining the laws of physics in them."<br>
<p>
If we learned how to alter the structure of space-time itself, that would be <br>
really amazing.  That would be the universe hacking it's own kernal, <br>
trancending itself.  Perhaps that's what it's been doing all along; hacking <br>
it's own kernal, to make it more intelligent next time it reboots, modifying <br>
it's design and then allowing the system to play itself out until it <br>
spontaneously reboots itself.  Perhaps the Big Bang is simply the most recent <br>
time the universe rebooted itself with an improved kernal, and perhaps this <br>
universe will figure out how to redesign itself so that life forms faster and <br>
develops more intelligently the next time it reboots.  Or perhaps, as Chris <br>
Hind brought up, the universe will learn how to create baby universes which <br>
also become self-aware, and able to improve themselves and do the same type of <br>
thing their parent universe did, inheriting a lot of it's basic <br>
characteristics.  There is the possibility that the universe itself is an <br>
organism, in an environment of other universes.  They may be breeding and <br>
feeding off each other.  Perhaps only the most lively universes ultimately <br>
survive, so we keep getting universes which are more living and intelligent <br>
and more able to propogate and maintain themselves.  Perhaps we are part of <br>
the growing brain of this developing organism.  Perhaps our universe is a <br>
decendant of universes who have developed pretty much the same way ours has, <br>
with the occasional mutations here and there for variety.<br>
<p>
If we become capable of creating baby universes and specifying the laws of <br>
physics and the initial state of the universe, we may be capable of making <br>
baby universes which develop very much like ours has and will.  Then these <br>
will do the same sort of thing that we did, continually reproducing.  Perhaps <br>
our universe has ancestors.  What an intriguing idea!<br>
