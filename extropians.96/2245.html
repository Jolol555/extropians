<i>&gt;  &gt; Hrmmph!!!  Since when has the scientific method been able to say anything</i><br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; science out of it.  It's not within its scope.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: By "scientific" I imply tangible physical measurement, </i><br>
<i>&gt; or "materialist," as in "the materialist measure of ownership</i><br>
<i>&gt; versus the imaginary measure of ownership."</i><br>
<p>
I know that that was what you meant, but when you used "scientific" so<br>
inappropriately then you were just asking to be corrected. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To that effect: to manipulate physical matter is control </i><br>
<i>&gt; physical matter, and to control it is to own it.  </i><br>
<p>
That's just handwaving, of course.  Possibly quite reasonable handwaving,<br>
but handwaving nevertheless, and lightyears from being indisputable, let<br>
alone logically unassailable.  In effect all that you are saying is that<br>
"I define ownership as direct physical control."  Fair enough, but you<br>
shouldn't try to disguise such a personal view as a higher truth demanded<br>
by logic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There may then be a theoretical system of "ethical" rules that </i><br>
<i>&gt; govern the allocation of physical properties among various actors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's that system that we agree is but a phantasm.</i><br>
<p>
It sure is, along with everything else about ownership and property.<br>
You're letting your Capitalist leanings colour your usually sound logic.<br>
I happen to agree that the system you and I support is probably as good<br>
as it gets in today's world, but that view can stand alone on its merits<br>
without needing to be bolstered by a handwaving argument.  Some phantasms<br>
are useful;  that doesn't make them real in any physical sense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; The Earth owns us all, the galaxy </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; owns the Earth, and the Universe the galaxy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; No it doesn't.  The great power-being Polkadot The Meaningful owns</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; everything.  So there!  :-)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; IAN: So your saying that ... [lots of good stuff snipped]</i><br>
<p>
Don't you dare question the teachings of Polkadot!  You will be<br>
tormented for all eternity by her Magnificent Pulcritude, which<br>
she has currently contracted out to the legions of devilbunnies,<br>
and you don't want to mess with them. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no "right" greater than the right you claim, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; your right is no more "real" than your ability to enforce it, </i><br>
<i>&gt; no more "real" than your ability to manipulate physical matter.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I know, we agree completely on the principle and why it works.<br>
We only differ in you wanting to justify it first by associating it<br>
with science and second by trying to give it the backing of hard logic.<br>
That's a flawed and unecessary approach.  Just be pragmatic:  property<br>
works in today's world, and that's a good reason for standing by it.<br>
