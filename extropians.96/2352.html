PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         <br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News<br>
Number 293  October 30, 1996    <br>
by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein<br>

A QUANTUM COMPUTER COULD TOLERATE ERRORS while carrying out <br>
calculations, researchers at Los Alamos have now shown. <br>
Computers that operated according to the rules of quantum<br>
mechanics have the potential to perform powerful tasks (such as<br>
factoring huge numbers) because of  their radically different<br>
approach to logic: unlike a conventional computer's bits, which exist<br>
either as a 0 or a 1, a quantum bit (or "qubit") could not only exist<br>
simultaneously as a 0 and a 1 but could interact with other qubits so<br>
that its properties became "entangled" with those of the other qubits.<br>
Yet some physicists argue quantum computers may be impossible to<br>
achieve on a practical level because the slightest amount of noise<br>
would destroy the entanglement and thus corrupt the state of the<br>
qubits.  Up to now, proposed "quantum error correction" schemes<br>
have shown merely how to preserve the state of qubits. Now, Los<br>
Alamos researchers (Raymond Laflamme, 505-665-3394) have<br>
developed an algorithm for carrying out reliable calculations on a<br>
"qubyte" made of 7 entangled qubits while accounting for the<br>
possibility that one of the qubits is corrupt (upcoming paper in Phys<br>
Rev Lett).  Experimentally, quantum computing is regarded as a<br>
long-term possibility: although quantum versions of logic gates have<br>
been constructed (see Update #250), researchers are still working to<br>
entangle more than two quantum systems at a time.<br>
