&lt;Check your locale for a provider of Sensory Isolation Tanks. Here in Santa <br>
Cruz you can rent one for $20/hour. Here is the URL of a manufacturer of <br>
same, about $5000. You can also build one, cost around $500....&gt;<br>
<p>
I think James was really asking if anyone has combined something like a <br>
sensory isolation tank with a virtual reality.  The problem I see is that <br>
these tanks don't allow the user to move around much or provide any way to <br>
interactively manipulate a VR.  Even if a helmet could be designed to <br>
provide the VR to the person in an otherwise sensory isolated environment, <br>
I don't think anyone has yet satisfactorily developed a system that would <br>
allow the user to interact with the VR without using their hands, although <br>
the military probably has some systems for pilots that track eye movements <br>
as a system manipulation method.<br>
<p>
In the mean time, there is *another* approach to sensory isolation and the <br>
experience of VR.  It's called dreaming!  Basically, when we are dreaming, <br>
the body's normal sensors and actuators are 'switched off' and the mind <br>
uses our current 'goal stacks' and memories to simulate scenarios and <br>
outcomes. Lucid dreaming and related techniques for trying to direct the <br>
content of these dreams might be useful exercises for analyzing situations <br>
and techniques that an uploaded person might need to interact with their <br>
virtual environment.<br>
<p>
One of the more sophisticated immersive VR environments at the present time <br>
is the CAVE system of DeFanti, et.al. at the Electronic Visualization Lab <br>
at the University of Chicago:<br>

There also is an interesting interview with Tom DeFanti in the latest issue <br>
of Mondo 2000.<br>

"We go back to the beginning. We are only observers, after all, and not <br>
actors, now that our labor is done. The information we gather can have no <br>
effect on the times we'll gather it from ... They sped along the conduits <br>
reserved for the subtle messages of subatomic particles, space-time's <br>
hidden circuitry." - Greg Bear, _Eternity_<br>
