<i>&gt; &gt;As nitpicky as you seem to be getting, basically we could use the old</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;homestead laws that were used to govern the european settlement of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;western territories of the US. You must maintain a constant human</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;presence, be actively exploiting the resources....etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think these old homestead laws will be that useful here; we</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't really create rules to approximate natural military boundaries</i><br>
<i>&gt; until we learn more about the military space technology that will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; concurrent with actual space colonization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To the extent that there are large powers or legal systems which can</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce contracts, then we can begin to think more in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; allocating space property rights in a more efficient manner, rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; which can be enforced via this power or legal system.  But to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extent that colonists are beyond the reach of such law, there isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; much point in gaining such property rights.</i><br>

Well, you could use their prior existence, as well as laws passed by<br>
european powers on the apportionment of colonies, as background to<br>
support the jurisdiction of a colony, in the WOrld Court. looking at the<br>
history, seeing that colonies wre granted by: The Pope, and The King of<br>
England (who was the head of the Anglican Church). We will ignore failed<br>
colonies that were assimilated into one or the others domains (i.e. the<br>
original New York colony, which was of Dutch origin is an example).<br>
These domains were enforced by naval power (i.e. to quote Mao: "Justice<br>
comes from the barrel of a gun").<br>
<p>
Based on this historical example, I would say that the company that<br>
builds the first linear induction mass driver could become the defacto<br>
power on the Moon, and would be in a superior position to prevent Earth<br>
authorities from putting up an argument about it. The fact that<br>
Heinlein, an Annapolis graduate, saw this as highly probable is in my<br>
mind additional supporting evidence. I would also say that the Air Force<br>
has made projections about this, due to the newest X plane project is a<br>
classified aerospace vehicle capable of carrying a squad of special<br>
forces troops and their equipment (this is the X-35). It is being touted<br>
by NASA in closed circles as a "Space Station Crew Rescue Vehicle", i.e.<br>
a vehicle to rescue the Space Station (Internationale) from opposing<br>
forces should the present state of things erode.<br>
<p>
According to people I've talked to, this is also the reason why the US<br>
wants to steer the worlds space effort away from using the moon to any<br>
extent: They fear being supplanted in the 21st century by a military<br>
force on the moon, which could rule it over all Earth nations, simply<br>
due to their superior position in the gravity well.<br>
<p>
WHy? because the exchange of military might is for the most part, and in<br>
the strategic sense, a competition of cost effectiveness. It is this<br>
reason why the US beat the USSR in the Cold War, we bankrupted them. It<br>
is also the reason why we lost the Vietman War: they spent far far less<br>
than we did for essentially equal military benefit. Being at the top of<br>
the gravity well with a large resource base puts you on top of the<br>
highest hill around with a huge store of ammo. With an induction gun,<br>
you don't even need to build warheads, you can just throw rocks and get<br>
nuclear sized explosive power with no radiation in earth impacts. using<br>
electricity generated from solar panels and nuke plants, you don't need<br>
an extensive chemicals industry to produce explosives and propellants.<br>
Having to expend a small fraction of the energy and resources as any<br>
Earth based power to attain equal destructive result puts you in a<br>
superior position to dictate terms.<br>
<p>
For anyone with further interest, I would suggest two books:<br>
<p>
The Art of War, by Sun Tsu<br>
The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, by Robert A. Heinlein<br>
