Sure computers are new, and will new kinds of impacts.  And at one<br>
time cars were new, trains were new, radio was new, etc.   But the<br>
question here is, do they fundamentally change the nature of economic<br>
growth any more than these did?  You have stated your belief in this, <br>
but have not offered any reasons.<br>

<i>&gt;If uploads are similar to other types of algorithms,</i><br>

<p>
Sometines a few fast processors are best, sometimes lots of little <br>
ones are best.  That's the way it is now, and should remain.<br>

You lost me here.<br>
