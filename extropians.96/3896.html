<i>&gt; I will forgive the insult, since Mr. Crocker can't know that I have lived and</i><br>
<i>&gt; breathed anti-statism, pro-capitalism, hierarchy of values theory, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; individualism for over 30 years...</i><br>
<p>
I made no insult to you; you are correct, I don't know you at all.  But<br>
when you express an idea that I see as mystical, I find no reason not<br>
to attack the idea.  Isn't that what we're here for?  Indeed, the very<br>
idea that to attack concepts is somehow to personally insult those who<br>
propose them is equally absurd.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of what Mr Crocker says is very fundamental, true, and, I would assume,</i><br>
<i>&gt; did not need to be reiterated on this list. However, there are two major</i><br>
<i>&gt; points where I differ from what Mr Crocker has stated and which make my</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument above not at all "mystical nonsense".</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1. Being alive is the irreducible primary to all other values. Without it</i><br>
<i>&gt; obtaining, all others are meaningless. Therefore, it must rationally have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; highest of all possible values in ones hierarchy. This implies that its value</i><br>
<i>&gt; (if comparable at all - see my next point) must rationally be extremely much</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher than the value of, say, going out to dinner and a movie once a week.</i><br>
<p>
Mere biological continuation of metabolism is indeed a prerequisite for<br>
cognition, and therefore values.  Therefore its preservation, as a value,<br>
must indeed compare highly with all others.  But it is still comparable.<br>
A slave may know, for example, that there are values attainable with<br>
freedom far beyond what he can attain in his present condition.  But if<br>
he values mere biological life incomparably high to those values, then<br>
he will logically not risk his life for freedom, but choose to remain<br>
alive and in chains.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. I am not prepare to agree that all human values are linearly comparable. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know *my* hierarchy of values contains incomparable trees. If all human values</i><br>
<i>&gt; were comparable, this would imply that everything that one values is comparable</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a certain amount of money. In essence, we would all be "value whores". This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is certainly *not* true of me and I believe that it is not true of *most*</i><br>
<i>&gt; people, certainly of most on this list.</i><br>
<p>
Why thank you.  "Whore" is a fine complement.  That is indeed precisely<br>
what I am.  I rent parts of my body to perform functions for the benefit<br>
of others, and they give me money.  In my case, it is my brain and my<br>
hands rather than my genitals, but to attach some judgment to that minor<br>
distinction is just snobbery and irrational moralism.<br>
<p>
As you correctly point out, if any two values can be compared, that<br>
implies that all values are assignable a dollar value.  Why do you find<br>
that idea disturbing?  I find it quite exciting.  Money is a great<br>
accomplishment of the mind, a triumph of reason over mysticism.  The<br>
reduction of human values to manageable, tangible measure, so that<br>
human relationships can be defined by free trade and self-interest<br>
instead of force and whim. <br>
<p>
If there existed two values that cannot be compared, then it would<br>
not be possible to rationally choose a course of action when they are<br>
in conflict, or even judge the action afterward.  I don't choose to<br>
live such an undirected, purposeless life.  I choose to have values,<br>
commensurable values, and to make choices and judgments from them.  To<br>
live some other kind of life I judge to be "mystical", and I cannot<br>
change that judgment, because it is a rational conclusion of the<br>
values by which I have chosen to live my life.<br>
