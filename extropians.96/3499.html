<i>&gt; &gt; Actually, that raises a point I hadn't thought of before.  Is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Singularity supposed to be incomprehensible to a human raised in/beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it?  This certainly wasn't necessarily the case for Vinge -- "Original</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sin" and "Just Peace" are set post-Singularity, yet the star humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; actually seem more or less unaugmented.  It is their tools that don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; make sense, particularly in "Original Sin".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for appearing unaugmented, that woud be a natural outgrowth of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; Prime Directive with regard to presingularity cultures: you must appear</i><br>
<i>&gt; unaugmented.</i><br>
<p>
No, it's a consequence of the Prime Directive for writing about beings<br>
smarter than you are - you can't.  Vinge can't either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      "Of course, I never wrote the 'important' story, the sequel</i><br>
<i>&gt;       about the first amplified human. Once I tried something</i><br>
<i>&gt;       similar. John Campbell's letter of rejection began: 'Sorry</i><br>
<i>&gt;       - you can't write this story. Neither can anyone else.'"</i><br>
<i>&gt;      		- Vernor Vinge</i><br>
<i>&gt;      "The toughest challenge for a writer is a character</i><br>
<i>&gt;       brighter than the author. It's not impossible. Puzzles the</i><br>
<i>&gt;       writer needs months to solve, or to design, the character</i><br>
<i>&gt;       may solve in moments. But God help the writer if his</i><br>
<i>&gt;       abmormally bright character is wrong!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;       		- Larry Niven</i><br>
<i>&gt;      "Charlie, of Flowers for Algernon, could learn a dozen</i><br>
<i>&gt;       languages, had an eidetic memory, could read a textbook</i><br>
<i>&gt;       an hour - all the things we ask of a computer. But when</i><br>
<i>&gt;       the rat Algernon keeled over, it took poor Charlie</i><br>
<i>&gt;       completely by surprise. It didn't occur to Charlie that if</i><br>
<i>&gt;       there was a simple surgical method to enhance</i><br>
<i>&gt;       intelligence, with no downside, it would have long since</i><br>
<i>&gt;       occurred as a natural mutation."</i><br>
<i>&gt;       		- Eliezer Yudkowsky</i><br>
<p>
- from "Staring Into The Singularity".<br>
