This is an idea that goes back to 1987.  I have told a couple of people <br>
about it, but never really announced it.  I think it is an idea whose time <br>
has come.  <br>
<p>
I want to introduce a new game, called Checkmate (aka hyperchess).    <br>
It is the same as chess, with two exceptions:  <br>
<p>
1.  There is no such thing as a draw or a resignation in Checkmate.  <br>
You always play the game to a conclusion.  Either it ends with a mate, <br>
or it is a null game, in which mate cannot be forced.  A game is not <br>
declared to be null until it is obviously and provably null.  <br>
<p>
2.  The players are teams, consisting of humans and computers <br>
working together.  There can be as many humans as you want -- as <br>
many as you can get to work together without getting in each other's <br>
way.  Coordinating their efforts is part of the challenge of hyperchess.  <br>
A team can either be led by a computer, which makes the moves with <br>
advice from the humans, who are in turn using other computers with <br>
specialized functions; or a team may be led by a human, who plays <br>
with the advice of other humans, all of whom are using computers.   <br>
Another possibility is that a team may not have a leader at all.  And <br>
of course it is possible to have a minimum team of an individual human <br>
and one computer -- with either the human or the computer acting as <br>
lead player.  <br>
<p>
In other words, your task, as a player of hyperchess, is to design and <br>
build a SuperIntelligence.  How you do it is up to you.   <br>
<p>
I want to issue a challenge to the Extropians:  starting a couple of years <br>
from now, let's have an annual Checkmate tournament.  <br>
<p>
The interesting thing about this is that designing a SuperIntelligence <br>
requires designing a mind.  How do you do that?  This is basically a <br>
philosophical problem.  You (the Extropian team) can use Ayn Rand's <br>
metaphysics, Ian Goddard's logic, Max More's philosophy of mind, <br>
Marvin Minsky's insights into AI, Tim Freeman's expertise in <br>
computer science, and so forth.  There are many people on the list <br>
who could make theoretical contributions, and many programmers <br>
who would enjoy writing the code that will have to be written.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile I will also be designing a SuperIntelligence, using my <br>
metaphysics, my logic, and so forth, and recruiting a team to help me <br>
write the code and play the game.  <br>
<p>
I want to extend this challenge to other memes as well.  For example, <br>
I'm going to go to meetings of some Campus Christian groups, <br>
at various colleges, and tell them about this.  They can design a <br>
SuperIntelligence based on their metaphysics (monotheist), their logic <br>
(Thomist), their philosophy of mind, and so forth, and they can use <br>
Christian chessplayers to play the game and Christian programmers to <br>
write the code.  (Christian programmers do exist.)  This idea is not new <br>
to them -- according to the Bible, the church itself is a kind of <br>
SuperIntelligence, with Christ as the head and the church as the body.  <br>
<p>
There are various other memes that might want to enter teams.  IBM <br>
can enter Big Blue, assisted by human players.  <br>
<p>
May the best SI win.  May the best philosophy win.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
