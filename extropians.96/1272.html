  This is a well-known correlation, but not necessarily a causal<br>
connection; demographers tend to use statistics as the basis for<br>
reasoning, instead of the other way round.<br>
<p>
  In a rural setting, children are not much of a handicap to one's<br>
personal and economic progress; in the urban environment, they are,<br>
as parents have to work far from home, children in the city need more<br>
supervision and protection; education in the city is different from<br>
just helping parents in their work - which turns a child's education<br>
process from an increasing assistance to parents to an increasing<br>
burden, free natural playgrounds are replaced by little constructed<br>
ones that come at a cost, etc., etc.<br>
<p>
  Such factors determine people's decisions regarding the optimal<br>
number of children - but they are all reflections of the structure<br>
of the economic life of a family, rather than appear as direct<br>
consequences of its productivity.<br>
<p>
  If you return parents into their homes - and closer to nature -<br>
with telecommuting, allow children to attend virtual schools or just<br>
download knowledge into their heads, use intelligent machine to<br>
increase safety, and make a few more structural adjustments, then<br>
the most advanced - including economically - households may find it<br>
much easier to have more children, and the correlation between<br>
family prosperity and size may change.<br>
