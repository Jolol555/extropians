<i>&gt;&gt;I was considering this thought. The best way to be uploaded is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;genetically engineer an organism that would grow into your brain and destroy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a neuron and map the equivelant connections in a virtual world. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;organism would serve as an interface between brain and machine. After</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;destroying the neuron, the organism would fill the gap with itself and have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;all connections from other neurons be redirected through the interface to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the virtual brain map inside a virtual world inside a computer. Long term</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;memory would be deleted and recreated and redirected to the computer first</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;which would make things slightly longer to retrieve while the organism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;slowly grew into and took over your brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why is this a 'genetically engineered organism', and not a swarm of nanobots?</i><br>
Because we are closer to genetic engineering than we are nanotechnology so<br>
we can be uploaded sooner.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;This would enable you to grow</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;into the virtual world to where you could switch between both and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;eventually disconnect all biological senses entirely and live inside this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;virtual world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think I'd like to live in both worlds.</i><br>
You can live in both worlds using a biological drone body or a<br>
nanite-composed drone body.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Is this better than cloning yourself inside a machine and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;destroying the original biological copy and thus kill off 'you' your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;self-aware being for some clone knowing everything you know living inside a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;virtual world?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Call me old-fashioned, but making an immortal copy of me doesn't appear </i><br>
<i>&gt;to *me* as if it helps *me*.  I'm not too keen on the idea of killing myself, </i><br>
<i>&gt;even if I know that there's some other me that's ready to take up the </i><br>
<i>&gt;slack. </i><br>
I myself agree, I was being sarcastic. I of course want to be me. I was<br>
explaining how the only way to upload is though a gradual upload.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I like about the idea of progressive replacement of neurons </i><br>
<i>&gt;is that to *me* it would feel as if nothing has changed - but I'd wind up</i><br>
with a <br>
<i>&gt;technological brain instead of this crummy old meat contraption.  I wouldn't  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have to kill myself off to make a digital clone - I'd become digital myself.</i><br>
Thats what I'm talking about but the organism would do the progressive<br>
replacement of neurons.<br>
