<i>&gt;If the things we wanted to study </i><br>
<i>&gt;spontaneously arose and varied themselves in precicely the ways we would if we </i><br>
<i>&gt;were setting them up as an experiment, then we wouldn't have to experiment at </i><br>
<i>&gt;all, just observe carefully and theorize.  But alas, the world isn't so </i><br>
<i>&gt;cooperative, so we must go out of our way to set up and vary interesting </i><br>
<i>&gt;phenomena to observe.</i><br>
<p>
Just a note to say that there are a few techniques set up to study <br>
some phenomena on an observational/encoding basis, chiefly ethology, <br>
which has had many applications in the study of primates and other <br>
group interactions.<br>
<p>
I don't know the computer programming involved, but Franz de Waal <br>
describes an elaborate code that allows his researchers to transcribe <br>
the actions of all subjects in a group, which are then entered into a <br>
computer.  Then programs are run that will reveal patterns of <br>
interaction or other metapatterns.<br>
<p>
It is through the technique of ethology that de Waal revealed the <br>
varied power structures among primate species.  In _Peacemaking Among <br>
Primates_, he describes how his researchers gradually uncovered a murder <br>
plot among a group of chimpanzees that resulted in their leader being <br>
assassinated one night.<br>
