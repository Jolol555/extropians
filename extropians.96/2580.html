<i>&gt; Specialization of this skill makes a whole lot more sense to me.</i><br>

<i>&gt; they do not participate in the decision process.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; answer to the question of "how do we decide who knows best ?" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply to say that it'll take the average of all human decisions</i><br>
<i>&gt; (including the bad ones).</i><br>
<i>&gt; To me, it makes more sense to have a dictator in power.  The method</i><br>
<i>&gt; of his ascension will not be voting, but rather becoming a leader</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of his success in the free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Leaders will autoevolve in a free market system, without the</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificial intervention of democracy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Unfortunately, this assumes that ANYONE should be "in power"  Look at<br>
the biggest organisms on the planet- coral reefs, Mangroves, underground<br>
molds, and hyperthermophilic communities in the earth's crust. The HTP<br>
biomass is estimated to exceed 90% of all the living mass on the planet.<br>
None of these has anything like a central authority, yet they are the<br>
most successful organisms.<br>
<p>
Here's an analogy, using an idea of a possible alien judgement on the<br>
superior species on the planet: <br>
<p>
The most superior species on the planet must be the cereal grains. They<br>
occupy all the best real estate, are tended to by an autonomous species<br>
which propagates the cereal's seed, and have a whole host of species<br>
which serve one or more of their needs. They absorb the vast majority of<br>
the solar flux, as well as material natural resources.<br>
<p>
BTW, they also do not have a central authority.<br>
