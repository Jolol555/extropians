Is it not possible for someone to help you with regard to one aspect of<br>
your values while simultaneously hindering you with regard to some other<br>
aspect of your values?<br>
<p>
For instance, you might publicly show me up in an argument by revealing<br>
some fallacy in my thinking, which would hinder me by damaging my<br>
reputation as a cogent thinker while at the same time help me by revealing<br>
the fallacy and allowing me to improve my thinking. Do these two aspects<br>
taken together form an overall help or an overall hindrance? That's a<br>
difficult question... I suspect it would depend on the situation.<br>
<p>
But even if I decided it was a hindrance (for instance, because the mistake<br>
in question was not a very important one), I'd probably choose to be<br>
tolerant of such things.<br>
<p>
As for your assertions about "only one thing can happen at a time", do you<br>
disagree that there are many computations being carried out in different<br>
parts of the brain simultaneously at any given moment? That is, do you deny<br>
parallelism and think that cognition only occurs at the focus of attention<br>
and that the human brain is not capable of "background processing", as it<br>
were?<br>
