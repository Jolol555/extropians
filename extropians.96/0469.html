In a recent post, someone wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Blacks are more stupid than whites.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think it is laudable if you accustom people to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;offensiveness of truth, but be prepared that you may suffer </i><br>
<i>&gt;some personal damage.</i><br>
<p>
The idea that accustoming people to the offensiveness of truth is a <br>
laudable activity on which I will not comment here.  However, I <br>
suggest that using the statement: "Blacks are more stupid than whites."<br>
as an example of a "truth" is at best confusing and at worst very<br>
ill-conceived.<br>
<p>
My suggestion is that when thinking of examples of "offensive truth"<br>
to accustom people, examples which refer to oneself might be chosen<br>
which demonstrate more rigor and less ambiguity.<br>
