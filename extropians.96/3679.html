I love this kind of puzzle because it shows what clear thinking is up<br>
against. It's possible to bamboozle even the most brilliant people, at<br>
least temporarily, by framing these probability puzzles so that our<br>
evolved instincts give us the wrong gut feeling about the answer. This<br>
is similar to the dreaded "Monty Hall" puzzle that created such a fuss<br>
in Marilyn Vos Savant's column some years ago.<br>
<p>
Before any roll of the dice, the probability that the next roll will<br>
yield boxcars is 1/36. Very simple. If you go into a casino and played<br>
roulette and bet 10 times as much every time you lost, that would not<br>
change the odds of red or black coming up on the next turn.<br>

<i>&gt;relates</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the issue of whether our existence here and now is influenced by the</i><br>

Wonderful! Do you see the error in your reasoning? Half the people who<br>
ever lived are still alive. What are the chances that George Washington<br>
is still alive? And how infinitesimal the probability that, out of all<br>
the eons of the existence of the universe, you and I lived now! But it's<br>
not unlikely, don't you see? The probability of anything having happened<br>
after it has already happened is 100%. There are an infinity of equally<br>
likely scenarios that didn't happen.<br>

<i>&gt;My personal opinion is that a random person in the room actually would</i><br>
<i>&gt;see the dice roll as sixes, and that if I found myself in the room I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would bet on the double sixes if someone offered me this option.  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;do you think?</i><br>
<p>
I'll take that bet!<br>
