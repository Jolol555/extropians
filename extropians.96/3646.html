I think that's a gross oversimplification. It would be remarkable if such a  <br>
crucial aspect of intelligence could be measured with just one number, you <br>
need 2 to measure something even as simple as the wind, one for speed and one <br>
for direction. I imagine that for a good measure of intelligence you'd need a<br>
Tensor, and a big one.<br>

<i>                &gt;Life has many meanings?  Name five.</i><br>
<p>
1) Justice<br>
2) Truth <br>
3) Beauty<br>
4) Happiness <br>
5) 42<br>
<p>
I will be glad to tell you the true meaning of life just as soon as you tell <br>
me in a precise non circular way the meaning of the word "meaning". Personally <br>
I think 42 is as good an answer as any.<br>
                                <br>

<i>                &gt;I invented Algernon's Law:  "Any major enhancement of                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;human intelligence is a net evolutionary disadvantage." </i><br>
                                             <br>
<p>
That "law" is so bad it's not even wrong. In the first place the fact that <br>
evolution has not come up with something is not evidence that the idea must  <br>
be bad, it's only evidence that evolution has not come up with it. As I said <br>
before, except for microorganisms, nature never figured out how to make a  <br>
part that can rotate in 360 degrees, despite the fact that it would certainly <br>
be a good thing to have in your tool kit. <br>
          <br>
In the second place, when you use a word like "disadvantage" you need to  <br>
specify from what point of view. What is being disadvantaged, life in general, <br>
the species, the individual, the genes, the memes? My memes are the only <br>
thing I'm interested in because I don't have thoughts, I am thoughts. <br>
