This strikes me as an oddly appropriate metaphor for the works of T. Leary. Should he <br>
have 'thought things out a little better'? Was he responsible for his 'creations'? <br>
(people who took lsd without the accompanying philosophy of set and setting).<br>
 <br>
This dynamic is also reflected in the differing views Hind and Hanson. Should an <br>
*extropian* (i.e. optimistic futurist philosopher) delve into a meme in depth or just <br>
shoot out ideas, as many as possible, as fast as possible?<br>
 <br>
This debate goes back at least as far as Huxley and Leary in the late '50's early <br>
'60's.(And much further, I imagine).<br>
<p>
My take on this is that there has to be both. A Leary/Hind to generate ideas and a <br>
Huxley/Hanson to delve deep into those ideas.<br>
 <br>
This also seems to me to be the crux of the 'mailing list quality' debate. Those that <br>
want depth are irritated at those that want breadth.<br>
 <br>
The optimistic part of me thinks that a balance will be struck and that the depth <br>
proponents will eventually ignore the scattershot ideas they don't have time to persue. <br>
And that the breadth proponents will come to understand that they can't expect someone <br>
else to do all their depth work for them.<br>
<p>
The pessimistic part of me is worried that the depth proponents will go somewhere else <br>
and deprive this list of their necessary 'weight'. Necessary in the sense that if I ever <br>
want to see the ideas I value gain any legitimacy or widespread appeal there has to be <br>
some substantial argument to convert the undecided.<br>
