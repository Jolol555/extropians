WHich in my opinion is just as much of a dogma without support as faith<br>
in a theism.<br>

If anything, this is probably where I wind up. You might also call us<br>
_Faithless Deists_.  The requirement to have "faith" is IMHO anathema to<br>
anyone who considers themselves to have a scientific mind. Whether this<br>
faith is in the existence or nonexistence of a U-Prime, it does not<br>
matter, as nothing can be proven, NOW. Others like John Clark would say<br>
that to a scientist, if it can't be proven NOW then it doesn't exist,<br>
which is wrong. There is much in our observable universe which we have<br>
no idea how it works, and there are plenty of loopholes in scientific<br>
theories that describe phenomena which we have no way of proving or<br>
observing NOW. Tomorrow we may be able to, and that is called progress,<br>
which is the scientists "holy" mission to bring about. A scientist<br>
cannot do so if he or she has a closed mind.<br>
