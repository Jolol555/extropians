<i>&gt; &gt;(I'd say most by now) insurance companies cover chiropractic treatment.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;think some are starting to cover acupuncture.  Massage therapy is rarely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;covered.  I don't know of any that cover herbal/homeopathic treatments.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, efficacy is not itslef a goal of insurance companies--they only<br>
care about customer satisfaction.  To the extent that comes from effective<br>
treatments, that's good; but if it comes from worthless treatments that<br>
cost less and satisfy the customer because of placebo effects, that's<br>
even better as far as the insurance company is concerned.<br>
<p>
Yes, there are some recent studies showing that manipulations can in<br>
fact help some back problems.  Chiropractors who stick to that, and<br>
who work on research to prove it really works, are doing good work.<br>
There are still chiropractors, though, who treat organic diseases with<br>
no understanding.  Hell, it's only been in recent years that the<br>
major chiropractic organization officially accepted the germ theory<br>
of disease.<br>
