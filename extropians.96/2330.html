Chris Hind wrote, "Can any cases of MP disorder share data between <br>
personalities? I've<br>
also heard about personalities writing to other personalities by writing<br>
letters to each other. Is there more than one form of this disorder?"<br>
<p>
A few months ago, I started becoming more aware that I have multiple <br>
personalities.  Since then, I've been observing myself, my thoughts and <br>
actions, much more closely, so I could understand better what's going on <br>
within myself.  I still haven't got everything figured out, and I'm not as <br>
clear as I want to be about how the various personalities relate to each <br>
other, but I have discovered many interesting things about myself.  <br>
<p>
I don't know how many personalities there are using this body, but to the ones <br>
writing this message, there seems to be very very many.  Generally, several of <br>
them seem to be active at any one time, and various personalities will become <br>
active, depending on what's being done and what's happening around us.  For <br>
example, if the piano is being played, certain personalities will become <br>
active; although which ones become active change each time we sit down to <br>
play.  Some groups of personalities are better than others, and so the quality <br>
of playing is somewhat unpredictable, but they are all learning from each <br>
other.<br>
<p>
It seems like it's a whole society in here.  There's a great deal of <br>
communication among the various personalities, and fortunately, everyone gets <br>
along pretty well, most of the time.  We all have different things that we're <br>
good at and different things that we like, and we're learning how to assign <br>
tasks more appropriately, so that we each do what we're good at and enjoy <br>
doing.  <br>
<p>
It seems like access to the body and certain kinds of thinking functions are <br>
limited, in the sense that some of us can't play the piano while another group <br>
is cooking lunch, so we're working out mutually agreeable ways of letting <br>
everyone have their turn and finding ways of working together for everyone's <br>
mutual benefit.  Many of our goals overlap, and we often find creative ways of <br>
doing things that accomplish parts of several different goals at once.  We're <br>
also learning how to expand our cognitive resources so that more of us can be <br>
active at once.  We're making a lot of progress.<br>
<p>
We're developing theories about how the various personalities have deveoped.  <br>
Our most favorite one is that by watching other people, in real life and in TV <br>
and the movies, and in reading books, different personality traits were <br>
internalized by the mind and various traits which went well together, formed <br>
around some sort of basin of attraction, to form a coherent personality.  It's <br>
as though we've observed society and internalized it, forming our own society. <br>
Some of the personalities are more developed than others, but we're all <br>
becoming more developed and differentiated all the time.  <br>
<p>
Our society could be considered a meta-personality, with many different <br>
personalities as members.  This meta-society we call "David Musick".  Among <br>
ourselves, though, we have no names.  <br>
<p>
Our internal culture is actually quite different than the culture between <br>
humans, because our methods of communication are quite different.  The types <br>
of language used varies, depending which personalities are communicating.  <br>
Some know each other well enough and are similar enough that their <br>
communication is basically telepathy, while others have to translate ideas <br>
into mutually understandable thoughts.  And some are so alien to each other, <br>
that they can't communicate at all.  Some are so alien that the Interface <br>
Committee (those of us that interface with other humans, such as the group <br>
writing this message) can't understand them at all and thus can't tell other <br>
humans about them.  But we're working on developing more effective means of <br>
communication among everyone here, and we're learning how to translate among <br>
various thinking styles with greater fidelity.<br>
<p>
It seems that the more attention that is being given to ourselves and how we <br>
work, the more the personalities develop and differentiate.  A few months ago, <br>
it was difficult to notice the different personalities, but it keeps getting <br>
easier, and the personalities are all becoming much more independent and <br>
well-defined very quickly.<br>
<p>
Of course, we don't consider multiple personalities to be a "disorder".  <br>
That's just the way things are for us.  If our internal organization <br>
interfered with our goals, then it could be considered a "disorder", but we <br>
find that we can accomplish our goals much better by working together than any <br>
of us could working alone, and the more personalities that develop here and <br>
learn to cooperate effectively, the better we're getting at accomoplishing our <br>
goals.<br>
<p>
The mind is very interesting, to say the least.<br>
