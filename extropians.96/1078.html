OK, I'll try (fools rush in where experts fear to tread..)<br>
<p>
Yes, strict economic theory can says that you can assign a cost to<br>
anything.<br>
This is almost a premise of the discipline. However, MNT is very likely<br>
to make the cost of local production of almost anything, lower than the<br>
transportation cost of that same item from a central site. That is, the<br>
differentials in production efficiencies that drive the current economy<br>
will disappear. With MNT, all I need to produce an item is the design<br>
for the<br>
item, and matter, and energy. This means that any individual who so<br>
desires can<br>
drop out of the global economy and revert to a "subsistence lifestyle"<br>
with<br>
material self-sufficiency. That lifestyle will be very lavish by today's<br>
standards. I suppose that an economy in these three inputs (design info,<br>
matter,<br>
energy) could in principle emerge, but not in time to avoid a complete<br>
meltdown<br>
of the existing economy. It may appear that a trade in designs would<br>
emerge, but<br>
I strongly suspect that the designs needed for lavish self-sufficiency<br>
will become<br>
freely available. The matter will be literally dirt-cheap, and solar<br>
energy will<br>
suffice for a lavish lifestyle, given a very modest improvement in<br>
collection<br>
efficiencies based on MNT-built-and-maintained collectors. Anyone who<br>
need more<br>
energy can build a thermal tap, or a fusion plant.<br>
<p>
Once MNT is available in crude form, MNT is likely to enable us to<br>
"bootstrap"<br>
very quickly to sophisticated MNT. At that point, there is nothing<br>
material that<br>
people currently need that a person cannot make. This means:<br>
   no energy industry.<br>
   no transportation industry (for goods.)<br>
   no contruction industry.<br>
   no maunfacturing industry.<br>
   no agriculture.<br>
<p>
The bulk of the service and information industries (banking, etc.) exist<br>
to support<br>
commerce, and will also be rendered unnecessary.<br>
<p>
The above can all be accomplished using MNT to simply build items<br>
equivalent to the<br>
ones we already have. There is no need to take advantage of MNT's<br>
abiltities to make<br>
new kinds of items.<br>
<p>
There remains the personal service portion of the economy, including<br>
medicine. My<br>
crystal ball is cloudier in this area. It's not clear how we'll<br>
compensate a provider<br>
of personal service, unless each of us becomes a provider and can pay in<br>
kind. Clearly,<br>
there will be very strong inducement to automate these jobs, since MNT<br>
implies that<br>
automation is of near-zero cost once designed. I suspect that most<br>
"menial" service<br>
jobs will disappear immediately: houses and clothes will be<br>
self-cleaning and<br>
self-repairing, and any item can be replaced (completely recycled) to<br>
renew or<br>
repair it. Food can be created already-cooked, on plates, on the table.<br>
<p>
Information services, such as teaching, are another matter. A great many<br>
people<br>
are likely to opt to teach their own children, assuming that instruction<br>
in the future<br>
looks like it does today. If computer-augmented intelligence develops in<br>
this<br>
time-frame, prediction becomes impossible.<br>
<p>
Direct personal services for the human  body, (medicine, etc.) are also<br>
another matter.<br>
MNT-based may of course help solve many of body-related problems.<br>
Alternatively,<br>
the difficulty of attending to a body may be an inducement to just get<br>
rid of the<br>
thing by switching to an MNT-built body.<br>
