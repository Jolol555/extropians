WHile I would not terms this as "cheap" space flight, if their engines<br>
actually work on a launcher, it would be less expensive than current<br>
systems.  People don't realize this, but it takes as much energy to get<br>
into low earth orbit as it does to fly to Australia from New York. Given<br>
this, and allowing for the different performance regieme of a space<br>
vehicle, true "cheap" space transporation would be tickets to orbit at<br>
$2000-$5000 per person.  Instead, we've got a government screwed up<br>
system that makes $1000 a pound seem like a bargain.<br>
