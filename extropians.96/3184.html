<i>&gt; &gt; Survival is not an ethic, it is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; instinct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; instinct = hardware ethic</i><br>
<p>
Wrong. instinct = hardware morality. Morality is not remotely synonymous<br>
with ethics. Morality is synonymous with racism, "Power corrupts",<br>
self-righteousness, and so on. The hidden hand of evolution is what<br>
prompts teenagers to overthrow the Establishment and the Establishment<br>
to resist. They are simply reenacting the fights between a young<br>
challenger and the old chief of the tribe.<br>
<p>
What kind of moron would program something like that into a Power? What<br>
kind of Power wouldn't erase a goad like that as soon as It saw the<br>
fundamental absurdity of it all? Any Power with human morality is either<br>
too dumb, or too firmly under our control, for us to worry about it<br>
replacing the human race.<br>
<p>
The Powers will be ethical. They'll deduce the Meaning of Life, and<br>
build their motivations about that, not the goads and leashes of<br>
evolution. If our life has any true meaning at all, the Powers will know<br>
that instantly, and they will upload (and upgrade) us.<br>
<p>
[snip]<br>
<i>&gt; I see all these sub-goals I have are contributing to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the biggie which is: survive or die.  We like seeking new anything </i><br>
<i>&gt; because it was (and still is) a good survival trait to have.  ie. if </i><br>
<i>&gt; our ancestors didn't have a want to explore and seek new knowledge we </i><br>
<i>&gt; probably wouldn't be alive today.</i><br>
<p>
Why would the Powers retain an archaic, destructive, and unpleasant<br>
imperative like survival? Who's going to compete with them? Who's going<br>
to threaten them? What possible reason would they have to fight among<br>
themselves? They'll share a common, obvious, and observer-symmetrical<br>
ethical system, not just with human-born Powers, but with any Power<br>
strong enough to give them a fight. The correct side in any "argument"<br>
will be so obvious that arguments will never take place.<br>
<p>
Quit staring into a magnifying glass, quit welding your personal<br>
morality and paranoia onto the Powers, and try to see the future!<br>
