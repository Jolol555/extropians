      -*Thanks to Anders, Nadia and Natasha for your recent comments.*-<br>
<p>
<p>
        From the optimistic comments I have received (and the pessemistic<br>
comments I have *not* received) it would appear that there is an interest in<br>
a transhuman\extropian art ML.  I guess it's time for me to get the pebble<br>
rolling and see if it causes an avalanche :-)!  What I need from everyone<br>
now is information on setting up a mailing list.  I'm sure David McFadzean,<br>
Alex Bokov and Max More should have this information, but if anyone else has<br>
any knowledge of setting up MLs, their input would be highly valued.  <br>
<p>
        Step two will be links.  If anyone on either mailing list would not<br>
mind creating a link to the ML (if it gets off the ground), that would be<br>
appreciated.<br>
<p>
        My general plan is that this ML will be a forum for TH, Extropian,<br>
Futurist, immortalist etc. artists to collaborate, comment upon, and<br>
critique each other's artwork.  I believe that there are many different<br>
genres that are included in the term 'art'.  Some of these genres include<br>
poetry, plays, visual artwork, sculpture, music, short stories, videos and<br>
essays.<br>
<p>
        I believe that an artist is a person who creates something that<br>
reflects a piece of his\herself within a genre.  As an artist myself, I<br>
believe that every time I create a piece of art, I am immortalizing an<br>
emotion or feeling that I feel upon the moment of completion.  I think,<br>
therefore I am; I believe, therefore I do.<br>
<p>
        With the creation of this mailing list, I think that artists shall<br>
be able to make their deepest and truest views open to their peers.<br>
<p>
        Within the next little while, I will be researching ways of how to<br>
create an ML, and what sort of avenues I will take to create pertinent<br>
links.  I have started on an FAQ and introduction, but any suggestions and<br>
contributions will be accepted with very open arms.  All in all, I would<br>
appreciate your involvement and input regarding this matter, and hopefully,<br>
it shall be successful.<br>
<p>
