<i>&gt; From: Steve Witham </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think part of the problem is that since programmers *can* write</i><br>
programs<br>
<i>&gt; in C++, the idea of making higher-level systems seems self-indulgent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Managers don't like the idea of programming as a quest, a project for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; empowerment, uplift, transcendence even, of humanity.  And programmers</i><br>
like<br>
<i>&gt; me are nerds, of course, willing to follow orders if it means we get to</i><br>
<i>&gt; engage our nerdly skills.  You know, "What was I thinking, uplift, hah...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I should get back to work..."</i><br>
<p>
I find that the problem usually comes from the fact that it's a pedagogical<br>
aproach to computers and interface design. Not many programmers are thought<br>
that at university. :-)<br>
<p>
Furthermore the tools that are best for multimedia production / advanced<br>
interface design still takes too many programming skills to be used by<br>
non-proffessionals.<br>
