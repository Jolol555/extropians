Until I get a *lot* more practice reading and appreciating poetry I won't<br>
even attempt to express a view on your poetry, Shaun, except to say that I<br>
welcome this an addition to the scientific, technological, and philosophical<br>
analysis and presentation of extropian/transhumanist ideas.<br>
<p>
I look forward to seeing more of your work on your web site. I really will<br>
have to educate myself in the poetry arena. Natasha (Vita More) has been<br>
writing transhumanist poetry for quite a while, and I feel I'm missing out<br>
on being able to properly appreciate it. Natasha also has a extropian-art<br>
filled web site, which I believe she is about to take to the next level. You<br>
might contact her -- flexeon@primenet.com -- to see about getting links<br>
between her site and yours, since I expect she will get a lot of traffic.<br>
With Natasha pioneering in this area, and now a few other artistically<br>
inclined extropians and other transhumanists, it'll be interesting to see<br>
how things develop.<br>
