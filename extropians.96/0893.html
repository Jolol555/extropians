A neologism for ecological engineering - designing, building and <br>
maintaining ecological systems. <br>

Depends on your sensitivity. Myself, I notice the pressure difference <br>
between my flat on the 14th floor and the ground level. One of my first <br>
augmentations will definitely be to enlarge the channel between mouth and <br>
ear. :-)<br>

<p>
Probably the simplest solution, yes. <br>
<p>
Building this kind of super/arcology-city is probably not that hard <br>
technically speaking (and with some advanced materials we can have real <br>
fun - some of you might have read Forrest Bishop's and mine visions on <br>
the transhumanist list a while back about diamondoid artificial islands <br>
with mountain cities and peaks intended to link to beanstalks). The <br>
problem is more economical (building new is expensive), social (make <br>
people want to live there) and logistic (how do you administrate it? Most <br>
of us would like to have self-organizing cities. Maybe each superbuilding <br>
could be its own "minicity" with its own commmunity and views). <br>
