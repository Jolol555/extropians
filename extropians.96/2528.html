<i>&gt; &gt; Probably most people will go the way of the gradual</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; recording chip).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, supposing that most people do gradually, incrementally upload.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What happens then?  When you are a computer program running in machine 1,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and you have an opportunity to shut down and start up (where you left</i><br>
<i>&gt; off) in roomier machine 2, will you take it?  Or will you insist on</i><br>
<i>&gt; "gradually, incrementally" moving to machine 2, with first one line of</i><br>
<i>&gt; code, and then another, moving over?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What if you have the option to keep running in machine 1 and also start</i><br>
<i>&gt; up in machine 2?  Are you going to take it, or would you feel better if</i><br>
<i>&gt; your machine 1 program was stopped when the machine 2 program started?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Will the machine 2 program be the same "you" as when you were the machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 program, or is it a different program that just thinks it's "you"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find that when I think of myself as a program in this way, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; inclined to believe that my identity is preserved across these kinds</i><br>
<i>&gt; of interruptions and copies.  This leads me to conclude that the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing is true about copies which span meat and machine.</i><br>

#1 - Once you are uploaded, an incremental duplication could take<br>
nanoseconds. Maintaining simultaneous existences would simply be a<br>
virtual method of reproduction, in a budding sort of way, while gradual<br>
crossover to new hardware, even if one wished to remain in the same<br>
hardware, would be a method of maintaining the integrity of the self.<br>
Budding is simply making more selves. As nanotech and space migration<br>
increase the resource base, then transhumans can purchase, build,<br>
whatever, the hardware needed to "house" budded selves. As the<br>
technology advances, virtual reproduction in a biological sexual sense<br>
(i.e. melding two genotypes) would create whole new mixtures of<br>
transhuman templates, rather than just copies of old ones. <br>
<p>
Becoming uploaded will enable an entity to reproduce in whatever manner<br>
is most beneficial to the entity at the point in time that the entity<br>
chooses to reproduce.<br>
<p>
maybe it's still the little Catholic kid inside me, but I still think<br>
that to not maintain the body/mind awareness through the transfer would<br>
break some sort of link. Even though a flash loaded mind may "think" its<br>
me, I still have doubts. THe human mind runs on too slow a baud rate, in<br>
terms of impulse transfer rate, and even the best silicon/biological<br>
interface will be a tight squeeze for a whole mind at once.<br>
