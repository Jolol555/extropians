<i>&gt;Well i can hardly believe my own eyes here. What is this talk? What</i><br>
<i>&gt;happened to "self organisation in a chaotic systems?"</i><br>
<p>
It's like they've suddenly thrown all we've learned about spontaneous<br>
orders and the free market out the window.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We don't need a overall design for this thing. What we need is a Technical</i><br>
<i>&gt;design guide for how to submit construcions, ideas, artwork etc. All we</i><br>
<i>&gt;need is an URL and a ftp adress. Then everybody can do their own stuff.</i><br>
<p>
Just use VRML specs and use teleporters to bridge the gap between each of<br>
our worlds. Decentralize! We can meet on my mist-shrouded mountain on<br>
thursday and your mansion overlooking an orange sea on saturday.<br>
Spontaneous orders will determine what environments we will want to visit<br>
more often. Just like how webpages compete for hits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let the good old competition decide who makes the best stuff. Lets have</i><br>
<i>&gt;competition.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;list. Somebody wants to do a 3D IRC chatchannel? Let'm roll their own.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Max More is completely right in saying that the biggest problem in a task</i><br>
<i>&gt;like this is that we can get no pay, and that we work at different paces. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have a LOT of experience in zero finance projects. The only way they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;work is if there is some kind of personal gain. (Artistic or financial) If</i><br>
<i>&gt;the financial gain is out of the loop, then it is almost impossible to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;somebody to work for free on one's own pet project. We all wanna do our own</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing.</i><br>
<p>
Again I agree. Labor of love. Self-motivated environments. Earlier someone<br>
meantioned tens of millions of dollars to put up a basic transhuman VRML<br>
world. Many people here on the list have webpages they put up themselves<br>
without spending thousands of dollars. It's not like each of us need to go<br>
out and purchase a T1 line and a high-end server, we can do it simply with<br>
our own internet accounts because most internet service providers will<br>
supply you with a free 1-10MB webpage. You can use that space to put your<br>
VRML world on especially now that most VRML WLD files are Gzipped. If your<br>
ISP doesn't give out free webpages, try www.geocities.com for a free 1MB one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We need to build a completely open system that we all can modify at our own</i><br>
<i>&gt;will. (well as much as possible.) The documentation should be there. Design</i><br>
<i>&gt;guides, technical limitations etc. But no overall design. With sections and</i><br>
<i>&gt;stuff. They will come automatically.</i><br>
<p>
The VRML specs are all we need. Why limit the possibilities for creative<br>
energy by centralizing the transhuman VRML realm?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let the beyond live it's own life.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed. It will evolve naturally. Ask your own DNA, does centralization<br>
work? If it could reply it would with a resounding No.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I could do cool VRML stuff today, maybe i could later add music, sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;effects and so on. (What about a 4Dimensional version of "LIFE" with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sound for when a cell dies and another when it is born. That could look</i><br>
<i>&gt;cool and make interresting sounds. with 3D balls(or pyramids) shifting</i><br>
<i>&gt;around in 3D space thru a 4th dimension. Whenever all the cells had died</i><br>
<i>&gt;new ones could be generated randomly.) Well just an idea :-)</i><br>
<p>
A good idea, but only the start of an incredible range of possibilities.<br>
(Not to put it down), But we haven't even begun to imagine how it will<br>
evolve and appear a decade from now. For those without VRML experience, I<br>
included, start writing up ideas in a text file or even on paper and evolve<br>
those landscapes and environments for more and more detail until the tools<br>
are easy enough for anyone to be able to create a VRML realm just as<br>
webpages are becoming easier and easier to create.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What we are designing is a social system. Let's use as many "off the shelf"</i><br>
<i>&gt;tools as possible. Moore's law tells us that they'll soon be wery</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerfull.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely. Do you know of any good freeware or shareware VRML creating tools?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then we can do it and make our own dreams come thru.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They will probably match each other nicely.</i><br>
<p>
I highly agree with you Max. If we all share certain common threads that<br>
unite us to form this mailinglist in the first place, those threads will<br>
definately show up in our independant realms.<br>
