While I agree with you in general, the medical establishment in the US<br>
is clealy more obviously interested in self-protection than science.<br>
Its outright rejection, without cause, of chiropractic, deep-tissue<br>
massage, accupuncture and chinese herbal medicine is evidence of<br>
this.  I name these "alternative medicines" because I have greatly<br>
benefitted from them personally.  I am very fortunate to have an MD<br>
who is also an accupuncturist and who does not scoff at every medical<br>
technique that does not use surgery or patented drugs.<br>
