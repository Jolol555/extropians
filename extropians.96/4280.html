Roderick A. Carder-Russell:<br>
&lt;What affect does music have on the experience?  [snip] It's affects <br>
on the delta/theta/alpha/beta system? Singing. Chanting.  Oxygen <br>
deprivation?  Aldous Huxley, in "Heaven and Hell", states the reason <br>
for singing in religion, all of the repetitive speach, is to deprive <br>
the individual of oxygen, inducing visions of god, which are nothing <br>
more than hallucinations.&gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps Huxley was thinking of Buddhist monks chanting all day long, <br>
which implies that meditation as well as the mental focus it brings is <br>
simply a hallucination due to oxygen deprivation?  The ecstatic states <br>
reportedly achieved by sufis, yogis, etc. (not to mention David Musick <br>
;-) must, then, be nothing more than hallucinations, shamefully <br>
allowing the celebrants to escape, even briefly, from the true reality <br>
of oppression and eventual death?<br>
<p>
Chris Hind:<br>
&lt;Avoid churches at all cost! They deprive the brain of oxygen! :)&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes ... "Just Say No!" Gospel singers must be so deprived of oxygen <br>
that they're just 'falling all over each other' because they can't <br>
stand up, they're losing all their energy.  (Other musicians must <br>
surely be damaging their health as well.)<br>
<p>
More seriously, songs sung in churches these days are rather brief. <br>
 The only threat to rational reality that such sing-alongs pose (on <br>
their own) is to cause a group of people to breath in unison and feel <br>
a shared emotion.  This, of course, must be a hallucination since the <br>
congregation will soon disolve and the individuals will soon be <br>
struggling to survive against the fittest back out in the hard, cruel <br>
world.<br>
<p>
Notions of personal responsibility, the ethic of "do unto others as <br>
you would have others do unto you", the desire to create a better <br>
future, the foolish notion of 'an everlasting life', or a meaning to <br>
life, or the spirit of thankfulness, these candies must be denied to <br>
the masses so that they can spend their time seeking them the proper <br>
way, through the gospel of science (all sales clerks please gather at <br>
the front of the store for our daily readings from Kant &amp; <br>
Wittgenstein).<br>
<p>
Mark<br>
(Doesn't 'believe' in God, or have much use for Faith, but <br>
occasionally enjoys church for the people-watching and group-singing <br>
opportunities, sometimes inspirational stories, the ambiance of light <br>
spaciously streaming through colorful windows, and those rare moments <br>
of delta/theta/alpha high.  BTW, perhaps I was just fortunate that <br>
demons and warnings about Hell were not part of my childhood religious <br>
experience. Mostly I remember stories about Jesus, this charismatic <br>
guy who wanted to empower people. The only negative was having to <br>
dress up and miss watching The Three Stooges on television :-)<br>
