Now that we can see that discussion of extropian principles works in a<br>
public forum why not move the action to alt.extropians? It appears that they<br>
shut down the thread on hotwired. Sure alt.extropians may have spammers and<br>
trollers but we can fight them off and even use them as memetic examples. I<br>
knew for the longest time that if we would let people discuss this publicly<br>
rather than isolated on a mailinglist that it would be a successful subject.<br>
Finally Proof!! :)<br>
So lets convince hotwired to put up one last post to notify users that the<br>
discussion is to be continued on alt.extropians. The public exploitation of<br>
extropian principles should be used to spread the memes due to it being a<br>
VERY SUCCESSFUL strategy which has been used quite successfully by the great<br>
religions of the world as "Witnessing" but extropians aren't NEARLY as<br>
annoying and allow people to come to them rather then them coming to the<br>
people. If we study memes and copy their replication patterns and methods,<br>
with the rationality and logic extropians profess, we may under 5 years<br>
annihalate religion from the face of the planet!! I have also seen great<br>
interest in the IRC channels expecially among the technically-minded.<br>
