Ira Brodsky says:  <br>
<i>&gt; I can verify that Chris Hind is very much human and </i><br>
<i>&gt; way above anything yet achieved by AI.</i><br>
<p>
To repeat:  the program has a front man.  The fact that Chris Hind is a <br>
real person proves nothing.  Of course he is real.  So are we all.  The <br>
question is whether the posts attributed to "Chris" (or "Lyle" or "John") <br>
are written by an AI.  <br>
<p>
As I said in my original post, <br>
<p>
::The Extropians have accepted it as part of the group.  No one notices <br>
::anything different about it -- no one has seriously raised the question of <br>
::whether it might not be what it purports to be, i.e. just another human.  <br>
::In other words, this program has passed the Turing test, so far.  <br>
<p>
This remains true.  Even after being told that there is an AI on the list, <br>
no one has seriously raised the question of whether one of the posters <br>
on the list is an AI.  Jokingly, yes.  Seriously, no.  <br>
<p>
The program continues to pass the test with flying colors.  <br>
<p>
Ira, how can you confidently say "way above anything yet achieved <br>
by AI?"  You only know what has been achieved in the past.  <br>
The point is, this program from CMU is *new*.  It is a quantum leap <br>
beyond earlier AI programs.  This is the first time an AI program <br>
has been unleashed on an unsuspecting world, and left to fend for itself.  <br>
And it is doing very well.  <br>
<p>
