I'm amused by the way this debate cycles from one list to email to <br>
another list.....but I think that this debate centers on some very <br>
important skills that every individual should develop, because we <br>
live in an era where we can no longer be certain of the reactions of <br>
the individuals around us.<br>
<p>
Anyhow, a few words from someone who trains people in nonviolent <br>
intervention techniques.  My own training in the area included <br>
several martial arts, sessions with weapons experts and IMPACT <br>
trainers.  I learned alongside FBI agents and Secret Service <br>
personnel, and I used to pick their brains as well for advice.  Not <br>
once in all those years did anyone suggest that this small weakling <br>
female purchase a gun.  What they did drill into my brain, over and <br>
over and over again was THINK!  BE AWARE!  USE YOUR HEAD! (sometimes <br>
accompanied by a thump on the cranium)  <br>
<p>
I've never been mugged (and I walk everywhere), but I spent seven years <br>
doing field work that put me into dicey situations involving armed and <br>
angry individuals.  What created a zone of safety for me and the other <br>
people I worked with was our own confidence in our abilities and reliance <br>
on the techniques we had diligently learned.  The ultimate confirmation <br>
of it was the time when one of our dear friends was able to deal with a <br>
carjacker and hysterical passengers in a manner that allowed her to <br>
keep her car, her money, everyone's life and the guy was soon <br>
arrested.  The police were totally blown away by her calm and capable <br>
handling of the situation.<br>
<p>
I'm certainly not going to argue against anyone carrying a weapon <br>
(and almost anything can be turned into a weapon if you know how).  I <br>
urge persons who do decide to carry a gun not to confine their <br>
reliance of safety solely on the gun.  Be ready to use other skills, <br>
other tools, other options.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
