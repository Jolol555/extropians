Anders:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; (Fun problem: think of how to circumvent the Bekenstein Bound and get</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; infinite information. It is possible in theory)</i><br>
<p>
Me:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Simple.  Find out what lies beyond quantum mechanics: it's just a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; theory, remember?  (An incredibly solid one, though.)</i><br>
<p>
Anders:<br>
<i>&gt; Well, that is in some sense cheating (meta-cheating?) and doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; guarantee a way to cheat Bekenstein.</i><br>
<p>
The Bekenstein Bound is just a corollary of the quantum nature of<br>
Nature.<br>
Remember the "hidden variable" propositions?  They are futile attempts<br>
to<br>
"describe" the quantum realm in terms of derived concepts like<br>
subjective<br>
reality.  Even today, many decades after the discovery of quantum nature<br>
of the universe there are few people who can conceptually grasp QM.  It<br>
seems to my humble consciousness that a similar thing is happenning to<br>
string theory at the moment, but I'm just an interested observer and I<br>
don't want to nurture hyperbole.  If a revolution is indeed in progress,<br>
I expect we'll end up with a more fundamental theory resulting in QM as<br>
its observable approximation.  Beware, in a stringy universe the concept<br>
of spacetime itself emerges from the theory; in contrast, in QM it's the<br>
stage on which the events happen.  Perhaps the quantum layer will prove<br>
to be the last useful one for practical storage of information or<br>
computation, but there's no way for us at this point in history to<br>
comprehend what realms might lie beyond (boars and pearls come to mind).<br>
