<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Bucharest, Romania -- In a drab dormitory, small children old enough </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to walk and talk grip the rails of their cribs in frustrated attempts at </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; locomotion, silently rocking back and forth.  A playroom filled with </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; toys, a paradise of imagination and exercise donated by foreigners, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; remains locked because the children's caretakers consider it too much </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; trouble to supervise.  The caretakers, women in white uniforms, sit a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; few yards away in the corridor, smoking and chatting.  </i><br>

The fact that it is an atheistic society has nothing to do with the issue<br>
described.  The problem is a social/moral/cultural/ethical/etc one.  Issues<br>
of moral responsibility have very little to do with whether or not a society<br>
is "atheistic".  The distinction of "atheistic" and "non-atheistic" won't<br>
generate any separation of the abundance of social and moral crimes<br>
committed throughout history.<br>
