<p>
But what does the chimeras think about their lives? Suppose you awaken in <br>
a paradise of your liking, with a benevolent Omega-point "angel" telling <br>
you that you have been resurrected by the Omega Universal Immortalism <br>
Institute (OUII) - but that you may or may not be a new being that never <br>
existed in this universe, or a perfect emulation of your old self. There <br>
is no way anyone (not even Omega) can tell which. Would you think you are <br>
a chimera, the Real Thing (tm) or vaciliate?<br>
<p>
Of course, Tipler is an adherent to the Many Worlds Interpretation, and <br>
would say there are no chimeras, just people being resurected in <br>
different worldlines from their original worldlines. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In fact, as he</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggests, "the Omega Point would be able to advise us on possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; imperfections"; so, the result would not be anything representing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; resurrection of historical personalities. In fact, as he proves using</i><br>
<i>&gt; game theory and Becker's notions of utility functions, such resurrected</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings would be more altruistic than (and thus not identical to) us</i><br>
<i>&gt; mortal beings in a world of finite resources.</i><br>
<p>
No, that would be the (hoped for) result after resurrection - if Omega <br>
would rewise the resurrected beings before they were emulated, it could <br>
as well make them up.<br>
