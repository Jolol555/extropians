I have it on pretty good authority that John Clark would not say that, <br>
he would say there are some things we can not prove or disprove now, <br>
and perhaps  never can. Thanks to the work of Godel and Turing we know that <br>
there are some true things we can never prove. However I have a hunch that <br>
John Clark would also say that if an idea can not help us understand how the <br>
universe works, regardless of its truth or falsehood, then we can certainly <br>
find a better use to put our valuable brain cells to than meditating on it.  <br>
Somebody once told me that "Genius" is the ability to know when your mind is <br>
caught in an infinite loop, I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I am sure <br>
Clark doesn't claim he can prove that theists are wrong, only that they're <br>
silly.<br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;The requirement to have "faith" is IMHO anathema to anyone                 </i><br>

                    <br>
<p>
I agree with that. For example, if I were to make an extraordinary claim and <br>
say that I had irrefutable evidence to back it up, but for reasons of my own <br>
am unwilling to show you the tiniest particle of it, then there would be <br>
absolutely no Scientific reason for you to take me at all seriously, doing so<br>
would be entirely a mater of faith.<br>
