I'm delurking here on one of my pet topics ... :-)  Greetings to all!<br>
<p>
In message &lt;1.5.4.32.19960828131135.00667fe0X1@pop.dial.pipex.com&gt;,<br>
Sarah Marr summarizes well many of our statements on UIF, and adds:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps this is another</i><br>
<i>&gt; subtle difference from UIF: DIF doesn't place the same opprobrium on those</i><br>
<i>&gt; who choose to allow others to restrict their freedom, because the dynamism</i><br>
<i>&gt; overtly recognizes that that acceptance is transient, and hence DIF is never</i><br>
<i>&gt; abbrogated.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I don't recall anyone suggesting such opprobrium in the context<br>
of UIF, although UIF was left loosely defined on purpose.  The UIF that<br>
we carved out originally on the &gt;H list certainly voiced no such value<br>
judgement, and my own &gt;IF doesn't do so either since acceptance without<br>
agreement is the norm in the totally subjective view of the world in &gt;I.<br>
<p>
Although I don't see any opprobrium being expressed anywhere in the<br>
UIF threads, even if it was, it wouldn't matter:  only in a community<br>
with jurisdictional controls does personal expression of opprobrium<br>
turn into coercion.  In a world where people have the means to defend<br>
their individual freedom (such as in the nanotech scenarios, but there<br>
are others as well), I doubt if opprobrium will be a significant player.<br>
<p>
You're totally right to say that a dynamic IF can never be abbrogated,<br>
but then that applies to all shades of IF, since they're all dynamic.<br>
<p>
I think Natasha's assessment hits the mark in this area:  these shades<br>
of individual freedom are really all one and the same in their most<br>
important aspects:  they're all inherently dynamic, because all static<br>
systems imply limits (usually jurisdictional) and none can support the<br>
needs of self-transformation across an infinity of threads of individual<br>
development in the transhuman diaspora.  Indeed, that is why I *defined*<br>
individual freedom to be dynamic --- nothing else meets the requirement.<br>
