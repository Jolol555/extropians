Well, I'm not sure it is a sacred cow (then you would get irritated if <br>
somebody told you "extropians are not an occult society"), but it is an <br>
interesting problem. We have all these attributions on people, places, <br>
things and actions that we have not consciously chosen and often are <br>
completely irrational - very irritating. <br>
<p>
In your case, it seems that you fear that we all wear masks on the list,<br>
and become someone else in real life. My personal experience is that this<br>
is quite rare (although there are some differences between<br>
net-personalities and RW-personalities, of course). I was pleasantly <br>
surprised when the members of the omega mailing list got together, they <br>
immediately enjoyed each other's company and we have made it a monthly <br>
tradition to dine somewhere. I expect the same goes for the extropians. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This idea gnaws at me and I hate it. Perhaps I</i><br>

<p>
I would gladly speak with you, although timezones and my erratic schedule<br>
makes scheduling a phone conversation a bit non-trivial (my number is<br>
&lt;country number sweden&gt; 08 83 76 21). But I suggest that you go to an<br>
extropian gathering - if they are a bizarre cult you can always sneak<br>
away. :-) <br>
