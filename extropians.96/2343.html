<i>&gt; &gt; I've been informed by Life Extension Foundation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Political Coordinator John Hammell that the article</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contains serious inaccuracies.</i><br>
<p>
Well, exactly what are the innaccuracies?  I have heard from many sources<br>
the the WTO is already working on supplement regulation.  Once these are<br>
in place it will be nearly impossible to repeal them.  Not often noted is<br>
that Congress does not really have the power to legalize narcotics because<br>
of international Treaties on the subject which take precedence.  These<br>
treaties would be extremely difficult to abrogate.  The same situation<br>
will obtain with vitamins and supplements eventually.<br>
<p>
I heard that Media Bypass also reported something similar so again,<br>
exactly what are the inaccuracies?  Are you sure the Life Extension people<br>
aren't just Burkhead clones?....can't see the big picture?  When someone<br>
claims serious inaccuracies without detailing them, I don't bother paying<br>
much attention.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't doubt that the danger to supplement production and health food<br>
stores is less immanent that suggested, but the principle?.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nevertheless it remains true that the FDA has been trying to restrict</i><br>
<i>&gt; our access to vitamins for a long time, and shows no sign of giving up</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this.  Meanwhile, other things such as pot and steroids are illegal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and this situation seems unlikely to change.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The questions remain:  how did this situation come about, and is there</i><br>
<i>&gt; any way we can get leverage on it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; James Daugherty writes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     The pharmaceutical Corporations, were unable to control Congress</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which recently responded to public pressure and allowed freedom in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; food supplements.  However, they are not so easily defeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in their quest to reap cartel style profits based on "reguations".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;      So, they are going to the World Government institutions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; circumvent our rights...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This seems unlikely to me.  Pharmaceutical companies can sell</i><br>
<i>&gt; vitamins at a profit like any other product.  I read somewhere that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; vitamins are made by pharmaceutical companies, usually Hoffman-</i><br>
<i>&gt; LaRouche, and then repackaged under various labels.  (If the vitamins</i><br>
<i>&gt; are supposed to be organic, they just mix in some floor sweepings</i><br>
<i>&gt; so the tablets will be speckled and organic-looking :)</i><br>
<p>
	They get higher profits for a longer period when their products<br>
fall under regulations.  If you don't know the pharmaceutical companies<br>
support the FDA you aren't paying attention.  Try reading Milton Freidman<br>
on the subject.  He has detailed somewhere how the industries regulated<br>
alwasys end up controlling the regulations.<br>
<p>
	Free competition serves the consumer, not the producers.<br>
<p>
	According to economics, in the absence of government enforced<br>
cartel regulations, profits tend to approach zero over time due to<br>
competition.<br>
<p>
	Clearly, all producers, unless morally restrained, look for a<br>
pretext under which to have the govt cartelize their industry, limiting<br>
competition, and thereby prolonging profits.  Protecting the public from<br>
fraudulent claims regarding supplements is a pretty good pretext esp. when<br>
the authority of "science" is put into the mix and "dangers" are touted<br>
bought and paid for "experts".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; James continues:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ...GATT=World Tyranny, not Free Trade!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;      Frankly, it is probably too late to do anything about it!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Everyone was too busy calling us conspiracy theorists names</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when we told you to oppose the UN, Gatt, Nafta, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, and you also told us about the CIA sex slaves.  &lt;g&gt;</i><br>
<p>
	So?  Have you looked into either issue?  Let's hear your<br>
refutation.  Interesting how you have such a high level of certainty with<br>
apparently no data.  What is so incredible about compromising high level<br>
pubpols and finpols with child sex, drugs, etc?  Seems like an obvious<br>
strategy that would work to me?  Are you familiar at all with the results<br>
of the 70's Congressional probes into the CIA?  MKULTRA?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are trying to find a causal explanation of the fact that certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; products are restricted and others are sold on the open market.  I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; the UN, Nafta, and GATT are irrelevant to this particular point.</i><br>
<p>
	Now this is really total ignorance.  The whole purpose of the<br>
World Trade Organization is to make product regulations uniform worldwide.<br>
There is no doubt this is already being worked on...our Congress has<br>
already endorsed whatever the WTO comes-up with just by voting for<br>
GATT....US Govt authority in these matters is already gone....whether or<br>
not Ian's initial report was fully accurate or not.<br>
<p>
	In the long run we can expect the special interests to manipulate<br>
WTO regulations.  The benefits of regulation can be concentrated in the<br>
producers....thus, a good feedback loop is created.  As the benefits of<br>
free competition are widely dispersed, the feedback loop is weak.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The main question is:  what is to be done?  There are several ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; to approach this.  One way is to begin by considering what Peter Voss</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrote in Extropy #17, pages 25 - 26:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe we are living in an era when basic freedoms are only available</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the very rich.  As Twirlip would say, this kind of sucks in a way, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; if this is reality then we had better recognize it as such.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lyle</i><br>
<p>
	Hmmm!  Easier said than done!  Esp. the very rich part.<br>
<p>
	And even the very rich have to risk jail and assets forfeiture to<br>
obtain illegal drugs.<br>
<p>
	I have been active in business for decades....so far everything I<br>
have tried has been too competitive to make any really big money.....as<br>
though guided by an invisible hand I continue to serve primarily the<br>
consumer of my products!  How about you?<br>
