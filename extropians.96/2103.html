<i>&gt;Most of the people writing about the universe as a 'computation' or "sea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of information" are physicists; e.g., Paul Davies _The Mind of God_,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fred Alan Wolf _The Dreaming Universe_, Brian Josephson, David Bohm,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nick Herbert, and so on (though some of these do tend to get a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystical).</i><br>
<p>
These authors are not talking about the same thing at all.<br>
Here we are talking about computing stuff unrelated to the easily<br>
observed behavior of the physical system, while they are talking about<br>
computing this observed behavior.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;We know which systems are exchanging bits with each other, and how</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;fast, and where this arrangement changes, etc.  We also know a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;about designing computers, carefully arranging the routes and speeds</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of bit exchanges.  And these two really look nothing alike!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our current computers are optimized for serial, not parallel</i><br>
<i>&gt;computations, have inadequate associative memories, and are pitiful at</i><br>
<i>&gt;communications.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What we know is only a tiny fraction of what we have yet to learn. How</i><br>
<i>&gt;much do we really know about the initial conditions of the many chaotic</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological and economic systems that we're still just identifying?</i><br>
<p>
I don't see the relevance of the initial conditions.  The initial<br>
argument was that the bit sequences we observe in nature are what our<br>
current understanding of communication design would lead us to expect<br>
from advanced computers.  My counter argument is that the circuit<br>
diagram is very far from what our current understanding of circuit<br>
design would lead us to expect.  Yes, our expectations may be<br>
completely wrong, but on the whole these observations can't be taken<br>
as support for the view that everything around us is colonized.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I read the Academy page and noted that they said: "Incomplete and</i><br>
<i>&gt;asymmetrically distributed information has fundamental consequences,</i><br>
<i>&gt;particularly in the sense that an informational advantage can often be</i><br>
<i>&gt;exploited strategically."  I assume that by "Mechanism Design" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;"signaling games" you're referring to approaches for controling these</i><br>
<i>&gt;chaotic, natural systems.</i><br>
<p>
No. that is not what I was referring to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How is this different from Vernor Vinge's Blight? The image I get from</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is a homogenous nanofog out to conquer the universe, leaving in its</i><br>
<i>&gt;wake only a Black Goo, or less, converting everything to its</i><br>
<i>&gt;pre-programmed optimal design.  How would such a system have any</i><br>
<i>&gt;creativity and what "new technology" could it ever develop?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd expect a colonized universe of this type to look very barren, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;like a black hole or a 'premature' Omega Point.</i><br>
<p>
I think you have assumed that such a huge nanofog must be homogeneous.<br>
Instead, it could support far more diversity and creativity and<br>
exploration of new tech than could vastly smaller civilizations. <br>
And why need the actions of such a civilization be "pre-programmed"?<br>
