Ian says:<br>
<i>&gt;You falsely divide the world into "logic" and "emotion."  What about</i><br>
knowledge? Yes, "with logic alone you can [only] calculate outcomes from<br>
premises." Likewise, with emotion alone you can only react.&gt;<br>
<p>
No, with emotion you can create. You can generate. You can luminate. With<br>
emotions you can fulfill and enrichen. You can move and you can soar. Passive<br>
reacting is a kind of limited way of knowing how one feels.  : o )<br>
Of course one can't always help having reactive ones, but that is not<br>
indicative of a finely tuned set of emotions.  In a well balanced, non<br>
reactive type B person, most emotions are useful,  some of them are<br>
essential, and many are helpful and well suited to the task at hand.  If<br>
emotions have a bad rap in the world, it is precisely because people think<br>
they are at the mercy of them... probably because it's real hard  work ( and<br>
it takes honesty, not just a bunch of hours at a keyboard or board meeting)<br>
to do the homework to integrate them successfuly.<br>
