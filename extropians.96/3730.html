Ambitious, imaginative and interesting proposal - I'd love to see<br>
it implemented.  Maybe, we can split it into Zones of thought: if<br>
you can't pass the arithmetic entrance test, you can admire the<br>
wonders of the Institute of Complexity from a distance, but can't<br>
touch them, or talk to their developers.<br>
  The only downside that I see to this is that such creation would<br>
require effort to the tune of tens of millions of dollars (and then<br>
a lot more still).  This could be done incrementally and after some<br>
point the project may become self-supporting financially.  Still, for<br>
the time being directing extropian effort into the more substantive<br>
development and propagation of ideas probably makes more sense.<br>
  Ironically, the first large-scale VRML worlds that we may see,<br>
will most likely host various simulations of flesh, group sports,<br>
and "uploads" of natural objects/scenes.  Thais is quite typical for<br>
many breakthrough situations, when the opportunities provided by<br>
the advanced fringe are exploited by the old but still powerful<br>
Establishment.  (My other examples here would include human<br>
intelligence that is still a servant to people's primary animal<br>
urges, and results of the democratic revolution in Russia that<br>
came through passionate struggle of its best people but were<br>
mostly used to enrich the powerful Communist scums).<br>
  I wonder if this scheme of events is going to work all the way<br>
through the rest of the social upload process (so far the liberation<br>
of different social functional mechanisms from the old physical<br>
carriers has been changing the tools, but not the nature, of the<br>
society).    Imagine the first uploaded people as Col. Quaddafi,<br>
Ross Perot, Pope, Michael Jordan, Pamela Anderson, Jean-Claud<br>
VanDamme - with lots of goodies in their worlds and millions of<br>
eager-to-follow fans.<br>
