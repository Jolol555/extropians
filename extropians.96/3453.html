That's exactly what hypothermia does. Continuing the hypothermia to low<br>
enough temperatures slow all biological processes so much that<br>
"hibernation" without decay for 100's of years is possible. If the organism<br>
can be cooled to such temperatures without ice crystallization (a process<br>
called vitrification) then no damage to the organism whatsoever occurs. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Such drug induced hybernation in my opinion is much more realizable and</i><br>
<i>&gt;most probably less damaging.</i><br>
<p>
No hibernating animals, even frozen frogs and fish, can survive in that<br>
state for longer than the normal amount of time for which they hibernate<br>
(less than a year).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;The fact that there have been documented cases of individuals going into</i><br>
<i>&gt;spontaneous hybernation for years at a time makes me wonder why no effort</i><br>
<i>&gt;is going on in this area. Surely slowing people's metabolic rate to 1</i><br>

<p>
Sounds life the story of Rip Van Winkle to me. I've never heard of such a<br>
thing. Are you thinking of comma's, or vegetative states, etc? These people<br>
all need and get feeding and other bodily needs attended to. Do you have<br>
any references to such examples of slowed metabolism? Maybe the reason why<br>
no one is giving effort to this area is that there are no such examples and<br>
the idea does not make physiological sense.<br>
