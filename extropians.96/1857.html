I think Greg was responding to a post I wrote, in the middle of the usual<br>
statist vs. capitalist debate, requesting a discussion about the way we get<br>
people to embrace the _ethics_ needed to realize such a "utopia" and how it<br>
will come to pass that enough people (50%?) will want to commit to self<br>
responsiblity and how the change will come about, since it is obvious we<br>
wouldn't be using any of the usual Political lies, coercion, indoctrination<br>
or some other infringement on their person.<br>
<p>
John Clark said it somewhere sarcastically ...<br>
<p>
"In other words, if everyone was a nice person it would be a better world. <br>
So what else is new?"<br>
<p>
I may be reading into this wrongly, but the philosophy is based on us<br>
individuals  being , if not nice, at least honorable. I think that inherant<br>
in the foundation self ownership based philosophy one must address this<br>
concern for rational ethics and thesad fact that many people do NOT know how<br>
to be either a  "nice person" or for that matter, self responsible or<br>
rational. Not to mention the victim mentality and so forth that is the norm<br>
today in much of our population worldwide.<br>
It has occurred to me that we indeed may have a long road to get "from here<br>
to there.."  Hopefully not one strewn with stragglers and throwaways.<br>
<p>
I wonder how one thinks people will learn to think in ways that make us<br>
honest, self worthy, independant and prosperous. <br>
Thank you for you considered and well thought out post, I am curious about<br>
Libertarian politics and any cohesive plans made towards actually<br>
implementing the freedoms that Libertarian  Anarcho-capitalist philosophy<br>
talks about.<br>
So far the Extropian list seems to hold  the clearest thinking coalition of<br>
free thinkers that I have met. <br>
<p>
Since you are an authority by way of being a State Sec., any information or<br>
forwards of Libertarian musings you would like to send to me would be much<br>
welcomed by this Artist/Muse.<br>
Much thanks again for your post, <br>
