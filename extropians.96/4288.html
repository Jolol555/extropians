<i>&gt;I found this an interesting experience. It seemed that by the end of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;class (we discussed uploading late on the second day) most of the students</i><br>
<i>&gt;were open to the possibility of uploading a human mind into a machine.</i><br>
<p>
Do you think that the progression of topics provided the key to this <br>
achievement of understanding, or were there other factors involved?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Considering that many of the students are Catholic, that was surprising.</i><br>
<p>
Given that Catholic theology (i) maintains a division between <br>
body and soul, (ii) has strong mystical/cabalistic roots and (iii) <br>
accepts the idea of the soul moving to other spaces, Catholics can <br>
actually access the idea of uploading more readily than some other <br>
religions.  Now, if only the Pope would issue an Encyclical endorsing <br>
the concept!<br>
