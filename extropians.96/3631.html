Well, LASERS keep getting smaller and people are talking about Quantum Dot <br>
LASERS, they would be mighty small, so maybe you could use LASER cooling. <br>
You tune a LASER beam to a frequency slightly below the Quantum absorption <br>
frequency of an atom, if the atom is motionless or moving away from the LASER <br>
it will not be able to absorb a photon from the LASER, but if the atom is<br>
moving toward the LASER the frequency of the photon the atom sees will be <br>
shifted slightly higher due to the Doppler effect. The photon is now right at <br>
the Quantum absorption frequency, the atom will swallow it whole including <br>
the momentum of the photon, this will slow the atom down. <br>
<p>
Yes, now that the atom is excited and no longer in its ground state eventually <br>
the atom will re emit the photon, but the direction is random, it's just as <br>
likely to cool the atom further as heat it, so this has no net effect on the <br>
cooling process. If you have 6 such LASER beams one for, forward, backward, <br>
right, left, up, down, you can cool things to very close to absolute zero. <br>
This has already been done, it's how a  Bose Einstein condensate was made <br>
last year.<br>
