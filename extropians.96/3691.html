<i>&gt; David Musick and Richard Brodie have said that, if they found themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the shooting room, they would be willing to bet that the dice won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; roll double sixes.  In fact David wants odds in his favor(!).</i><br>
<p>
Good for them--I'll give you 30 to 1 too (I'll bet $30 against your<br>
$1 that they won't come up 6-6).  You quite correctly point out that<br>
/after the fact/, 90% of the people who bet my way will have lost<br>
$30.  But I'm not making the bet after the fact--I'm making it before<br>
the dice roll.  Time is a fairly simple concept, and I'm not sure<br>
why you seem to have such confusion with it.  After the party, if<br>
some random participant came up to me and asked "what will you bet<br>
me that I /saw/ 6-6?", he'd have to give me $10 to $1.  Also, if I<br>
were in the population of people from whom the experimental subjects<br>
will be drawn, and I'm asked to bet on whether I /will/ see 6-6<br>
whenever I'm drawn (cancelling the bet if I am not), then you'd have<br>
to give me $10 to $1.  But neither of those bets is the bet you asked<br>
about: you asked about a single roll of fair dice, and that is 1/36.<br>
<p>
In other words, you are setting up rules, and then asking that I<br>
ignore certain ones where they apply, and apply others where they<br>
do not.  Just clarify your definitions and all is as it should be.<br>
<p>
Your appeal to Bayesian analysis holds no water either, because you<br>
set up the rules of the game clearly before you started playing.<br>
Having set up the rules (which included "fair dice"), you are forbidden<br>
from making deductions that assume otherwise.  Take your other<br>
coin-flipping example: after 100 heads, you are justified in thinking<br>
that a 2-headed coin is a possibility, because you have not said<br>
otherwise in setting up the conditions of the experiment--we are<br>
given only the outcomes, so we can correctly state that the odds of<br>
a fair coin are small, and the odds of a double-headed coin are<br>
nearly 1.  If you start the problem by saying "a fair coin is<br>
flipped 100 times...", then you must conclude that the odds of heads<br>
after 100 heads in a row is 1/2, because that's the definition you<br>
gave.  You don't get to make up rules and then ignore them when it's<br>
convenient.  <br>
<p>
This problem isn't even as tricky as the Monte Hall problem, because<br>
the missing assumptions are easier to identify.<br>
