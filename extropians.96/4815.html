<i>&gt;&gt; Michael Lorrey then replied:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I concur with Eliezer. </i><br>
<p>
John Satta then replied:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I understand this is a visceral response to a highly emotionally charged</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; subject. I'm not trying to start an argument but I would like to know why</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you are upset at making a profit from this film.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<p>
To which Michael Lorrey said:<br>
<i>&gt;For the same reason I would be a bit perturbed at someone selling</i><br>
<i>&gt;tickets to his mother's funeral. Tickets to his own funeral is another</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter, especially if he is still around to enjoy it. I have since the</i><br>
<i>&gt;movie came out learned that Spielberg put the profits to use in</i><br>
<i>&gt;educational projects on the Holocaust, and am somewhat mollified. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that he did this indicates he shares my own revulsion from</i><br>
<i>&gt;profiting on the dead.</i><br>
<p>
Profiting on the dead? The film relates historical incidents. Yes, the<br>
principals are dead. The movie also made a profit. Does that mean that<br>
every profitable retelling of history is to be reviled?<br>
<p>
[snip of description of Jewish Nazi collaborators]<br>
<p>
Nazi collaborators should be reviled. I agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since we as transhumans are seeking to attain the next level of human</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution, we run serious risks in having our ideas and programs branded</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the popular media as neo-eugenics, racist, neo-nazi, etc., </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure I understand the connection between Extropianism and the Final<br>
Solution. They seem diametrically opposed to me. I grant you that some<br>
extropian concepts could be misconstrued or misrepresented. <br>
<p>
Schindler's behavior, which the movie celebrates, is an example of how one<br>
person can make a difference by turning the power of a corrupt government<br>
against itself. As a capitalist used to playing all the angles Schindler<br>
was able to scam the German military into releasing certain people into his<br>
"employ" where he could keep them alive. <br>
<p>
I would imagine that turning a corrupt government against itself would warm<br>
the heart of many anarchists or libertarians.<br>
<p>
<p>
[large snip]<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For this reason, we must be adamant about inclusivness, that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhuman future is for all humans, not just for the elite that will</i><br>
<i>&gt;develop the tools of attaining it. We must also as a group be decisively</i><br>
<i>&gt;aware of this lesson from the past. Remember, the Nazi party was fouded</i><br>
<i>&gt;by misfits, outcasts, and intellectuals, just the type to be subscribers</i><br>
<i>&gt;to this list.</i><br>
<p>
If we are to be aware of the leesons of the past we must understand<br>
history. To understand it we must know the facts of history. We must learn<br>
those facts where we can. Anyone who presents researched history is doing<br>
real commendable work and should be compensated accordingly. Will they then<br>
be "profiting on the dead?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-- </i><br>
<i>&gt;TANSTAAFL!!!</i><br>
<p>
I agree. Education, in any form, is not a "free lunch." Somebody must be<br>
paid for it. And if historical research isn't profitable enough for the<br>
historians, they might do something else. <br>
<p>
Now if the complaint is that Spielberg made too MUCH of a profit, that's<br>
another discussion. :-)<br>
