<i>&gt; I think that last statement is actually a key point.  Any idea you come</i><br>
<i>&gt; up with that will present the issues and choices of tool design better,</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be equally applicable in AI.  User interface is just organizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; information and choices better.  If you do it so well that the user isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary, then you have AI.  Seriously.</i><br>
<p>
I partially agree with that. But there's a slight difference in who has the<br>
initiative . In an AI system the "Machine" has the initiative, in the IA<br>
system the human, or what the human becomes, is seen as the center of<br>
initiative.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway, what I'm saying is that the real work of AI is the work being</i><br>
done<br>
<i>&gt; by more "mundane" programmers: organizing knowledge in better, more</i><br>
<i>&gt; compatible, computer-manipulable ways.  So, much of software development</i><br>
<i>&gt; is leading to AI, or the singularity, whichever comes first, but it's all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same process.</i><br>
<p>
Thats right but i believe it should be more focused against empovering the<br>
end-user. The whole idea of system development is a bummer. It should be<br>
possible for the end-user to develop their own systems.<br>
Of course it's not easy and it can't be done today ot tomorrow, but if we<br>
focus on that as the end-goal, then it should happen sometime.<br>
