NSA would just hate this. Just write an according RFC, and listen for <br>
comments. You might even face legal action.<br>

<i>&gt; security.  An encrypted file generated by a speedy, unsafe encryption </i><br>
<p>
Why? You still are free to use heavy-duty encryption, should you feel <br>
like it. An encryption scheme which takes 1 hour to break makes routine <br>
snooping by dedicated parallel scanner chips totally worthless. The step <br>
from us to ks is a tall order.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; program would differ from a file generated by better encryption </i><br>
<i>&gt; programs.  The difference wouldn't be apparent to a casual observer, </i><br>
<p>
But not obviously so. Perhaps I should elaborate on unsafe encryption: I <br>
consider IDEA relatively secure, while DES being unsafe encryption.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but the NSA could see the difference.  </i><br>
<p>
But not _casually_. That's the point.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so that high-entropy pieces (compressed stuff causes this anyway) </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; flowing thru NSA (heard the interrupt pling?) nodes </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, they would have to rely on other methods besides scanner chips </i><br>
<i>&gt; that simply recognize high-entropy messages.  But other methods are </i><br>
<i>&gt; available.  Devising such methods would give them something to do, </i><br>
<p>
Though such methods, should they exist, are surely not public.... I doubt <br>
easy methods exist. It is quite impossible to tell random from <br>
pseudorandom, and compressed stuff from encrypted stuff (ok , the latter <br>
gives a totally white spectrum).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; maybe increase their budget...  no problem.  </i><br>
<p>
Good cryptography scales very favourably in terms of roi. NSA would have <br>
a very hard time scanning myriads of trivially encrypted packets, even if <br>
their budget rise to astronomical (and I mean it) heights.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In a sea of pseudorandom bits generated by a simple encryption </i><br>
<i>&gt; program, a "seriously" encrypted message would stand out.  Then</i><br>
<p>
CAMs/iANs do not produce trivial sequences. The only way to tell them <br>
apart would try a serious cryptoattack, which is a very costly business.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; they would know:  here is somebody who has something to hide.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The standard encryption isn't good enough for this guy -- so who is he?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; And then they would proceed to find out who he is.  </i><br>
<p>
These arguments are not valid. Cryptography does not work this way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let me rephrase my original statement:  using more encryption than </i><br>
<i>&gt; other people commonly use is like painting your windows black when </i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody else uses curtains.  It just attracts attention.  </i><br>
<p>
It is a wrong picture, but everybody using cryptography equals to anybody <br>
having windows. It is just some of them are bulletproof. Really easy to <br>
tell, huh?<br>
