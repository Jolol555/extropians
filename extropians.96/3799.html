As it should be your right to choose if you want to be selfish, and to what<br>
extent, just like to what extent you should wish not to be. ;-)<br>
I can however see the benefits of a group, and to a certain degree of a<br>
group mind (allowing privacy). If you wish to share the benefits of such a<br>
group, some privacy or at least some selfishness will have to be given up<br>
(be it maybe for other 'selfish' reasons). Just like those groups have the<br>
right to decide to what minimum level, the individual should have the right<br>
to choose between those groups, or not to choose for a group at all. Today<br>
we have groups (states) where this is not the case. hmmm.... <br>

<i>&gt;Unlike Altruism, they do not depend on anyone else to self sustain.</i><br>

<p>
I'm sorry for using the term 'altuism', English is not my native language,<br>
and i couldn't come up with anything which would describe what i intended.<br>
(which btw is why i ''d it) Although i agree that altruism isn't the correct<br>
word, i think 'rationality' also doesn't quite coin it. Honesty might serve<br>
best to replace it, as one individuals honesty or thurth is not by<br>
definition the same as anothers.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I see your basic point - So, if one is "rational" , above boards , and needs</i><br>

<p>
So what do you suggest we use for this **protection** ? Mind you that one<br>
person may 'feel' a random action by another individual, based on<br>
information he got from the first person, as either 'invasive scrutiny' or<br>
'unhealthy interference', whereas the second individal will not view it this<br>
way. My point was that the writer assumed a situation completely without<br>
'ethical' judgement (or maybe his own).    <br>
