<i>&gt; The 100+ eyewitnesses may have seen a missile, or they may have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt;  something else -- people sometimes misinterpret what they see in the dark.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But one thing I am certain they didn't see: hundreds of people converging</i><br>
<i>&gt;  on the crash site to cover it up.</i><br>
<p>
Just my $.02:  One of the primary elements of my work is trying to uncover<br>
the "truth" from eyewitness accounts, usually of unexpected and<br>
extraordinary, often violent events.  From my experience (1) perception and<br>
memory in such situations is extremely unreliable, even in disinterested<br>
witnesses, (2) mutliple witnesses can influence each other's perceptions and<br>
memories subtly but very strongly, (3) strongly-held "memories" "mutate"<br>
significantly over time and (4) all of these factors seem to be even more<br>
significant regarding events that happen at night.  I can't offer systematic<br>
documentation for these assertions, but most folks who do what I do for a<br>
living will agree, I think.<br>
