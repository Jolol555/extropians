Here's an article on shaping nanoparticles that I thought might be of<br>
interest to the group. It comes from "Research Horizons" a publication of<br>
the Georgia Tech Research Institute. Other articles can be found at:<br>

     Shaping Nanoparticles<br>

     GEORGIA TECH RESEARCHERS have succeeded in creating specific<br>
     shapes and sizes of colloidal platinum nanoparticles, a<br>
     development that could lead to advances in the field of catalysis.<br>
<p>
     "It is known that catalysis on metal surfaces depends on the face<br>
     of the metal crystal used," says Dr. Mostafa A. El-Sayed,<br>
     principal investigator for the project and the Julius Brown<br>
     Professor of Chemistry in the School of Chemistry and<br>
     Biochemistry. "When nanoparticles of certain shapes are used, it<br>
     is expected that their catalytic activities will vary from one<br>
     another -- and, most likely, from metal crystal surfaces -- as<br>
     they have edges and corners that clean-polished crystal faces do<br>
     not have.<br>

     "In addition, since a good fraction of the atoms of nanoparticles<br>
     are located on the surface, where catalysis takes place,<br>
     nanoparticles are expected to be much more effective in catalysis<br>
     per gram than their crystals," he adds.<br>
<p>
     Although previous studies have explored the factors that influence<br>
     the size distribution, stability and catalytic activity of<br>
     colloidal particles, this work marks the first time researchers<br>
     have been able to control the shape and size of such particles in<br>
     colloidal aqueous solutions at room temperature.<br>
<p>
     In addition to catalysis, the results could have implications for<br>
     other fields, since colloidal metal nanoparticles are used as<br>
     photocatalysts, adsorbents, sensors and ferrofluids, as well as in<br>
     optical, electronic and magnetic devices.<br>
<p>
     The collaborative project included researchers from California and<br>
     Germany, and is funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research. This<br>
     summer, Science magazine published a paper describing the group's<br>
     work, titled "Shape-Controlled Synthesis of Colloidal Platinum<br>
     Nanoparticles," in its June 28 issue.<br>
<p>
     El-Sayed's primary collaborators include: Dr. Zhong L. Wang, an<br>
     associate professor in Georgia Tech's School of Material Sciences<br>
     and Engineering; Temer S. Ahmadi, a graduate student registered at<br>
     the University of California, Los Angeles, but who came to Tech to<br>
     finish his Ph.D. research when El-Sayed moved from California to<br>
     Atlanta two years ago; Travis C. Green, a graduate student in<br>
     Georgia Tech's School of Chemistry and Biochemistry; and Dr. Arnim<br>
     Henglein, a professor at the Hahn-Meitner Institut in Germany.<br>
<p>
     To achieve their results, the researchers altered the ratio of the<br>
     concentration of the capping polymer material to the concentration<br>
     of the platinum cations (positively charged ions).<br>
<p>
     The capping polymer material -- in this case, sodium polyacrylate<br>
     -- wraps around the particles to stop their growth and make them<br>
     soluble in water, but does not affect their chemical reactivity.<br>
<p>
     To create colloidal samples for the study, the researchers<br>
     synthesized platinum nanoparticles in a liquid solution at room<br>
     temperature, introducing argon and hydrogen gases. The latter<br>
     served to reduce the platinum ions into neutral atoms in the<br>
     process of making the nanoclusters.<br>
<p>
     Three different samples were used, each with a different<br>
     concentration of the capping polymer. All other factors, such as<br>
     the salt and pH levels, the solvent used and the temperature, were<br>
     kept constant.<br>
<p>
     The researchers observed several different geometric shapes,<br>
     including tetrahedral, cubic, irregular- prismatic, icosahedral<br>
     and cubo-octahedral forms. The distribution of the shapes was<br>
     dependent on the ratio of capping polymer material to the platinum<br>
     cation.<br>
<p>
     The first sample, for example, had a ratio of polymer<br>
     concentration to platinum salt of 1 to 1, and contained 80 percent<br>
     cubic particles. Sample 2 had a ratio of 5 to 1 and was dominated<br>
     by tetrahedral shapes. It also had small percentages of polyhedral<br>
     and irregular-prismatic particles.<br>
<p>
     Sample 3, with a ratio of 2.5 to 1, contained a mixture of<br>
     tetrahedral, polyhedral and irregular-prismatic particles.<br>
<p>
     In all three samples, researchers were able to reproduce<br>
     tetrahedral and cubic particles three times.<br>
<p>
     But learning to control the shape and size of colloidal<br>
     nanoparticles is just the beginning. The researchers now must<br>
     explore the mechanisms of the process at the molecular level, to<br>
     understand how it works. This will include detailed studies of how<br>
     solution properties such as pH, ionic strength, viscosity and<br>
     temperature affect shape distribution.<br>
<p>
     "Once we understand how a certain shape for a nanoparticle grows,<br>
     and the type of catalysis that each shape can induce," El-Sayed<br>
     says, "we will be able to tailor the nanoparticle shape needed to<br>
     catalyze the different chemical reactions important to producing<br>
     energy, cleaning the environment or making expensive [drugs] more<br>
     economical."<br>
