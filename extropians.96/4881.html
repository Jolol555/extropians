<i>&gt;Just as a general line of thought, specifically what is involved in memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering?  What are the steps and procedures involved?</i><br>
<p>
My quite subjective advice would be this: think about the ideas<br>
(both knowledges and values) that you feel have most changed the<br>
world in the direction that you want it to change. Study the lives<br>
of the people who came up with those ideas, and the people who<br>
argued for them. Make your own judgement of what they did that<br>
worked, and follow their example. It would be nice to simplify this<br>
down to a cookbook procedure, but it's only honest to recognize<br>
that cultural evolution is probably the most complex process the<br>
universe has concocted so far.<br>
<p>
I once dropped a quip that probably bears repeating here. Memetics<br>
is the computational discipline that makes young math-science types<br>
eventually realize what those humanities freaks have been going on<br>
about all those years. And when I say "humanities freaks", I don't<br>
mean cultured historically-aware human beings: I mean specialists,<br>
people who monastically dedicate their lives to the humanities. I<br>
suspect that this is the kind of thing that most of them are on<br>
about. I am almost certain, for instance, that this is what motivated<br>
Nietzsche in his odd behavior. Hayek was a politer man and kept<br>
quieter about his motivations, but I suspect he may have been up<br>
to something like this as well. Other examples abound: I'm sure you<br>
can find plenty more on your own.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On a macroscopic level historical memes seem to follow some very basic</i><br>
<i>&gt;patterns and models.  Can this be applied on a microscopic level to</i><br>
<i>&gt;influence specific targets?  </i><br>
<p>
I would be suspicious of the temptation here. To put it crassly,<br>
we're talking about patterns of vibration within (neuronal vibratory<br>
firing) and without (vocal chord and tympanum vibration, real as<br>
in speech or virtual as in literature) human brains, and human<br>
brains are intractably complex if any physical system is. And even<br>
the above description is a drastic oversimplification. Personally,<br>
I think the role played by example is far more powerful in memetic<br>
evolution than the role played by language. This is why we have<br>
the maxim "Practice what you preach".  This is probably why someone<br>
around here uses the Gandhi quote "You must be the change you want<br>
to see in the world" in eir sig.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would it be possible to build a piece of software that could simulate and</i><br>
<i>&gt;predict the evolution of a meme?  Would it be possible to build a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt;software that could aid in the design of complex memes?  Or a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt;software that could model memes?</i><br>
<p>
Well, you'd want a very sophisticated adaptive computing system.<br>
Probably something with an Edelmanesque combination of genetic<br>
algorithms and sophisticated unsupervised-learning feedback neural<br>
networks. For instance, your brain would make a good prototype for<br>
such a software system. I hope this doesn't sound snide, because<br>
I'm being entirely serious. The people who are playing this game<br>
are applying so much of their brainpower to the problem that they<br>
develop reputations as "absent-minded professors". Sometimes they<br>
get lost in the 24th century (is that what happened to Reilly?)<br>
and they say stupid things like I heard Baudrillard say on the<br>
radio a few months ago: "We must serve language." Bah!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A memetic modelling tool could have some very interesting applications.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;a "good" modelling/engineering tool was designed, couldn't this give small</i><br>
<i>&gt;organizations enormously disproportionate amounts of influence?</i><br>
<p>
I doubt it. We have new terms to describe this game, but it is a very<br>
old game, one that has already accumulated so many internal tricks and<br>
self-deceptions that any simple honest person would be utterly disgusted<br>
with the whole endeavor. But I think people like Lyle Burkhead actually<br>
enjoy it.<br>
<p>
I think I'm going to go find out what Raymond Smullyan is up to these<br>
days.<br>
