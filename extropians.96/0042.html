HelLO everyone.<br>
<p>
I seem to be a reactivated playing piece.<br>
<p>
Just read a day's worth of messages about the meaning of Extropianism.<br>
<p>
My feeling is that too many specifiers narrow the specification.<br>
In other words, to broaden the appeal of Extropianism, it might help<br>
to simplify its description.<br>
<p>
Right now, the closest thing to a central principle is "extropy," a word<br>
that, well, doesn't make me salute every time I hear it.  I mention it<br>
because Max seems to find it central; maybe if he were to anchor<br>
Extropianism, that would be where.  But I would point to the people who<br>
become lower-case "e" extropians.  My simplification is that we're<br>
"Bottom-Up Fast Futurists," or BUFFs.<br>
<p>
Now, I'm stretching these terms to stand for slightly more complicated<br>
ideas.<br>
<p>
"Bottom-Up" means we see history as good ideas, technologies, opportunities,<br>
happening locally and spreading.  Notice I packed technophilia and<br>
optimism in there.  Also, interest in libertarianism and spontaneous<br>
order (see my P.S. to Ben below) and memes and such are close by.  Also,<br>
there's a difference from the planning- and statistical-trend- and<br>
grand-vision-driven sorts of futurism.  Another part of being bottom-up<br>
is seeing oneself as part of the process.<br>
<p>
"Fast Futurist" means someone who sees big change happening so fast that<br>
the future is personally relevant, as opposed to a place where "future<br>
generations" will live.  We see ourselves in the future.<br>
<p>
Allow me to go through the wonderful BEST DO IT SO catechism:<br>
<p>
Boundless Expansion -- Uninterest in limits.  See Dynamic Optimism.<br>
<p>
Self Transformation -- This is seeing oneself there.  Part of being bottom-<br>
up is seeing oneself as a system, not a given for the world to be built<br>
around.  Also, the Fast Future happens in my lifetime, so I'd better steer.<br>
<p>
Dynamic Optimism -- Partly a difference from doomsaying, which looks at<br>
trends, and threats to existing orders.  Bottom-up looks at opportunities.<br>
The difference from smug optimism? maybe just the techie (=materialist?)<br>
orientation, and the fact that things are happening Fast and Bottom-Up<br>
(out of control), and that we're personally going to be involved.<br>
<p>
Intelligent Technology -- just another technology, but it undercuts the<br>
centrally-planned-home-for-future-generations-of-humans picture.  And it's<br>
a good example of a Bottom-Up Fast Future right in our faces and under our<br>
fingers.<br>
<p>
Spontaneous Order -- A better word for bottom-up, but who wants to be a SOFF?<br>
<p>
My extrapolation from personal experience is that extropians are people who<br>
got used to seeing in a BUFF way.  The idea of a "personality type" is<br>
somewhat anti-ST, un-DO.  Rather, the way we were seeing it then<br>
(late 20th) at least, Extropianism seemed like a good idea at the time.<br>
<p>

<p>
P.S. Ben Goertzel &lt;ben@godel.psy.uwa.oz.au&gt; said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But I don't get the conceptual connection of Libertarianism with</i><br>
<i>&gt;futuristic technology, complexity theory &amp; spontaneous organization.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;After all, is the State itself not a "spontaneous organization? --</i><br>
<p>
Good things and bad things (including things that reduce freedom)<br>
happen within freedom.  But overall more freedom means more good vs. bad.<br>
Bad things and things that reduce freedom tend to be symbiotic.  For<br>
instance, scratch a monopoly and you'll find it relying on state power.<br>
So, it's bad overall to reduce freedom *just because some bad things--<br>
even unfreedom--happen within it.*<br>
<p>
But even if you're not convinced, the Libs and complexity theorists and<br>
other Spontaneous Orderphiles often find each other's ideas sympathetic.<br>
