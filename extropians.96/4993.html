<i>&gt;} will get to the future eventually, it's only a matter of time. I don't want</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Really?  I could use a gradual transition myself.  If a complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;Singularity happens, it'd be nice to think I'd have some skill to adapt</i><br>
<i>&gt;or at least understand what was going on.  I certainly still have much</i><br>
<i>&gt;to learn -- not to become fully competent, but to at least have a working</i><br>
<i>&gt;idea of as many fields as possible.  You ready to meet the Powers?</i><br>
<p>
Anything it takes to survive. I'll augment or redesign everything about<br>
myself to survive the singularity. But I don't want it just to be me, I<br>
want everyone on this list to be there with me as well. Otherwise, its<br>
lonely at the top. Current estimates place the singularity at 2025,<br>
possibly even earlier. For folks on this list later in their years, I<br>
_hope_ I don't even need to _hint_ at the idea of cryonics.<br>
