Why should you care that much if your decendants don't know where<br>
exactly in space you lived, as long as they shared your values and<br>
other central characteristics?<br>
<p>
[[The idea was that the descendants may be infiltrated and give away<br>
the ancestor’s location.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One method of countering this obstacle is to blast clear corridors</i><br>

<p>
Anyone try to work out the details on this?<br>
<p>
[[AFAIK, this idea is originally mine. I took it from my previous work, <br>
<p>
the “South Pole Accelerator” of 1981, which uses its probes to blast a <br>
partial vacuum corridor through the Earth’s atmosphere. That in turn <br>
came<br>
from particle beam research (in vogue at the time). A pilot beam blasts <br>
a <br>
corridor in the atmosphere, followed by the energy weapon.<br>
I have not put much analysis into the interstellar version yet. The SPA<br>
version was modeled continuously. Gas kinetic theory is applicable to <br>
the <br>
interstellar medium, and perhaps also to the dust grains <br>
(alternatively, these can be treated as stationary objects). One rather<br>
open problem is the method of interaction and energy deposition in the <br>
spacecraft structure. This requires a lot of quality analysis.<br>
The short answer is to launch lots of colinear probes.]]<br>

<p>
Dan Clemmensen raised this point, and I tried to respond to it in some<br>
detail.  Did you read those posts?<br>
<p>
[[No, wish I had. I did see a thread about quality of posts vs noise. <br>
I’ve been<br>
deleting most ExI and &gt;H mail lately due to the noise level.<br>
One idea I came up with is to have a _self rating_ system in the <br>
header, say <br>
Quality Levels 1-5 (Q1-Q5). It might make for an interesting <br>
experiment!]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;..  The point is that in general the creatures whose purposes lead to </i><br>
<i>&gt;the most reproduction end up dominating the future. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[This an argument for quantity over quality. Since viri and bacteria </i><br>
<i>&gt;reproduce the fastest and the mostest, do they therefore  dominate ?]]</i><br>
<p>
Yes, they have dominated for quite some time.  We have a shot at<br>
beating them, but haven't done so yet. <br>
<p>
[[Well we’re off to definition land. To me, domination is the realm of<br>
the intelligent, of those that can rearrange things according to their <br>
conceived desires. But really, I’m not much of a philosopher.<br>
