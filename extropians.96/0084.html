<i>&gt; Human beings have diverse purposes, but I see no evidence that </i><br>

<p>
At some point (soon) we are going to take charge of our own evolution.  <br>
It will be directed toward some goal.  It is true that different people will <br>
have different purposes, at least for awhile.  I'm not sure this situation <br>
will be stable, however.  The Darwinian competition is going to turn <br>
rather vicious, and people with frivolous goals may not survive.  <br>

<i>&gt; I doubt that your "complete vision" is attainable, because such a </i><br>
<i>&gt; complete vision would have to make manifest all causal relations </i><br>
<i>&gt; *including* the causal chains that pass through the internals of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; people "having" the complete vision. </i><br>
<p>
Ok.  Your point is well argued.  I may have to give up the word <br>
"complete."  As Freeman Dyson says, the universe is infinite in all <br>
directions.  I agree that this fact is a source of deep joy.  <br>
<p>
However, I am speaking of a vision that I have already seen on several <br>
occasions;  at least I got a glimpse of it.  There are many questions in <br>
my mind about how to characterize it, but no question about whether it <br>
is real, or whether it is worth pursuing.  <br>
