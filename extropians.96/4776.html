Laughing is a rational value?  I don't think people who refuse to laugh<br>
at things are always suppressing their urges; I think they generally<br>
don't see a joke.  Especially if they have a strong offense reflex.<br>

On the other hand, reading a lot of C.J. Cherryh and imagining a<br>
firearms instructor has I think given me more empathy with the<br>
humorlessness of security guards on duty.  Humor is often something<br>
being out of place, but in Security something out of place can kill you.<br>
