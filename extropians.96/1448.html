It seems that Dan Clemmensen, Rich Artym, and John Clark, are making<br>
the same argument here.  Let me summarize their "NanoDream", as I<br>
understand it:<br>
<p>
At some point there will be a device which <br>
-- can disassemble generic stuff in the environment into feedstock,<br>
-- scan any (house-or-smaller-sized) object for its atomic-level design,<br>
-- sythesize a plan for constructing such an object from feedstock,<br>
-- retool itself and construct the object with a low error rate, and<br>
-- repair itself, or break slowly enough to replace itself anew often.<br>
<p>
If such a device were smaller than a house, and could replace itself<br>
in less than a year using stuff available from an acre of land, and if<br>
copyright on the design were not strictly enforced, but if property<br>
rights to such acres of land were strictly and cheaply enforced, then<br>
it would seem that within a hundred self-copy times, most everyone who<br>
owned an acre of land should have such a device, obtained at the cost<br>
of a small fraction of their acre.  And it seems they could then, if<br>
they chose, soon have an acre full of devices for which the design<br>
copyright was not strictly enforced.  And they might so choose if<br>
public designs were not much worse than private designs, and if local<br>
production were near as efficient as distant specialized production.<br>
<p>
Given all this, some folks seem to want to infer that at some point<br>
most living humans will fit the scenario of living off their own small<br>
plot of land, using basically free designs.<br>
<p>
If I've understood this right, I can challenge the conclusion by<br>
pointing to all the assumptions that may not hold.  I do no have much<br>
doubt that eventually such a device will be possible to construct.<br>
However, by that time many other changes may happen as well.  The sun<br>
may dim due to intervening solar collectors, or the O2 and CO2 may be<br>
stripped from the atmosphere.  An upload or other population explosion<br>
may mean that the ratio of population to acres is far less than one.<br>
Or wealth may be very unequally distributed, so few can afford an<br>
acre.<br>
<p>
Copyright on these many devices may in fact be strictly enforced, by a<br>
combination of self-destruction upon scan attempts and draconian<br>
punishments for violators.  Public domain designs of most sorts may be<br>
quite inferior to private designs, or generic one-size-fits-all<br>
devices may be rather inferior in efficiency to specialized devices,<br>
even given shipping costs.  Property rights to acres of land may not<br>
be cheaply enforced, but require payment of substantial taxes or PPL<br>
fees.  To pay such fees, one may have to devote a substantial fraction<br>
of ones resources to production at an advanced level - public domain<br>
defense system designs may be nowhere near up to the task.  Finally,<br>
most people may prefer more to live be closer to other people, in<br>
dense cities, than to have their own isolated plot of gadgets.<br>
<p>
Now folks may have plausible arguments for each of these issues.<br>
And I'd like to hear them.  But what are the chances that *all* of<br>
these issues go the way of this NanoDream?<br>
