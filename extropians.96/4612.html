<i>&gt;Since we are at madcap ideas, again: I've been reading up on some </i><br>
<i>&gt;preliminary prospection, erm, cosmochemistry. What is the legal </i><br>
<i>&gt;situation: which country/person owns the Moon? Phobos? Is this a claim </i><br>
<i>&gt;thing, first comes first, or is it currently legally undefined? I'd </i><br>
<i>&gt;assume the latter. As you doubtlessly know, unmanned LEO launch capacity </i><br>
<i>&gt;will soon grew progressively cheaper and cheaper, currently there are (tiny) </i><br>
<i>&gt;amateur satellites up there. Assuming one would start a large private </i><br>
<i>&gt;project, with the goal of constructing a smallish von-Neumann probe (the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Moon, or a suitable asteroid for target), complete with an ion drive </i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently strong to carry it from MEO. Of course, one would need much </i><br>
<i>&gt;better digital electronics, and through research into industrial </i><br>
<i>&gt;processes in hard-vacuum/low-grav conditions, but we might be ready to </i><br>
<i>&gt;launch such a beastie 20-30 years from now. After the stuff arrives, </i><br>
<i>&gt;unfolds, autoreplicates, etc. etc. you could ferry around (solar sails) </i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrary amounts of processed materials, e.g. nickel-iron steel, organics </i><br>
<i>&gt;(plastics, etc.) titanium, platinum, solar cells, whatever. One could </i><br>
<i>&gt;deliver the stuff by ballistic course to any place on Earth, using the </i><br>
<i>&gt;atmospheric layer for decceleration. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What's your oppinion, when will the general public realize that all above </i><br>
<i>&gt;is not just another fraudulent scheme, and would invest in such a company?</i><br>
<p>
1) I don't think most of the public is informed well enough to make a<br>
determination as to whether or not this is a fraudulent scheme.<br>
<p>
2) The economics of such an endeavour are beyond everyone but a few<br>
governments and the largest corporations.<br>
<p>
However, the profitability is obvious.  I think I read that one nickel/iron<br>
asteroid retrieved from the asteroid belt could produce as much refined<br>
metal as had been produced in the entirety of human history.  And despite<br>
the high cost of retrieving the asteroid, you could sell the metal for a<br>
small fraction of the cost of earth-derived metals and still make a huge profit.<br>
