Robin Hanson, in his very interesting "Great Filter" essay<br>
about our prospects for expanding into the universe &lt;URL:<br>
<a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html</a> &gt;, mentions in passing<br>
an argument which I have heard only a little about:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Note that this cause for concern has a different basis than the simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistical arguments of Gott [Gott 93] and Leslie [Leslie 96] that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; else equal we shouldn't expect many more future humans than there have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been past humans.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if this argument makes sense to people.  I apologize for discussing<br>
it without having read the original but hopefully I have the gist of it<br>
right.  The idea is that, given a person chosen at random, chances are that<br>
he will be average in most ways.  In particular, he will be about average<br>
in terms of when he lives in the grand scope of human history.<br>
<p>
If we graph human population over time, and assume for simplicity that the<br>
resulting total human population is finite, then the average person's<br>
time of living can be found by multiplying each era by the population of<br>
that era, adding these up, and dividing by the total human population.<br>
In other words, the average person will live at a time when the total<br>
number of people who have lived before him will be about the same as the<br>
total number who have lived after him.<br>
<p>
Now we take the step of taking ourselves as our randomly chosen people.<br>
Applying the argument, we conclude that approximately as many people will<br>
live after us as have lived before us.  Because of the recent increase<br>
in population, it follows that there can't be many years left for humanity<br>
because most of the people who have ever lived are alive now.  Our time<br>
seems to be about up.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm not telling it right, but this argument seems quite weak to me.<br>
First, I don't accept the notion that each person can view himself as a<br>
randomly chosen individual.  There has been no selection procedure such<br>
as we normally think of in random choice.  Rather, each person throughout<br>
history has his own conciousness.  And in fact I seem to be not at all<br>
random even compared to people in my own time.  I live in one of the richest<br>
countries in the world; even among such people I have attended some of the<br>
finest schools in the country; my interests and abilities are extremely<br>
unusual.<br>
<p>
Looking at it in Bayesian terms, I am going to live out my lifetime here,<br>
this year, whether the human race self destructs in a few years or not.<br>
Both outcomes are equally consistent with my life experience.  So I don't<br>
see how the knowledge that I am alive should cause me to change my<br>
estimate of the likelihood of these two outcomes.<br>
<p>
Even if we accept this probability argument, there is then the question<br>
of what the sampling pool is.  Is the argument consistent with a transition<br>
to a post-human stage in the near future?  Could we say that the argument<br>
validly predicted the end of the human race, but that the ending is actually<br>
a transition to another stage?  Just how much of a transition is necessary<br>
for the argument to retain its force?  I don't see any way to answer these<br>
questions.  If there are no answers then I think the argument is invalid.<br>
<p>
I actually have another idea which answers the argument on its own terms.<br>
Think in terms of the Moravec/Tipler picture where humanity lives<br>
forever but spends a lot of time simulating the past.  Then Gott's<br>
argument would suggest that the "average" person should be from the<br>
era most simulated.<br>
<p>
What is the most interesting period to simulate?  Why, the Transition,<br>
of course: those brief millenia when we went from being paleolithic<br>
cavemen to posthuman gods.  So naturally they'd look at that over and<br>
over again.  And our era is probably high on the list, the first age when<br>
we began to realize what is happening.  Even among our era, those people<br>
most simulated would be those who became aware of the great changes in<br>
store for them, such as Extropians.  And the moments which would be most<br>
simulated would be when they were actually thinking and communicating<br>
these ideas... just as we are now.<br>
