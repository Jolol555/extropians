Ask not what your brand name can do for you, <br>

Actually, this is where genetic technology can far outstrip nanotech, at<br>
least sooner. The programming is already there. Programming a horde of<br>
nanobots to regrow an arm is a non-trivial task. It is far easier to use<br>
genetic and bio technology to do these things. We should look at what<br>
nanotech can do that is inefficient for other technolgies. Nanotech could<br>
quite possibly be a cure-all, but it will be an inefficient one initially.   <br>
<p>
But wait..New thought just hit. You can use fractal and self-replicating<br>
mathematics and the like to program nanobots, could you not. Would that<br>
increase the efficiency substantially? Or has this already been discussed.<br>
