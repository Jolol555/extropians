<i>&gt;Some of you may recognize my name from the Brain Tennis </i><br>
<i>&gt;exchange HotWired in August. I think it would be fair to</i><br>
<i>&gt;say, that all things considered, the extropian side </i><br>
<i>&gt;more than held its own - it rocked.</i><br>
<p>
Ahhh, so I FINALLY convinced you to start posting eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Art by M.C. Escher. </i><br>
<p>
Ahh, nice choice. H.R. Giger is also pretty cool (of aliens and species<br>
design lore).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright.</i><br>
<p>
Does anyone know of a good webpage relating to this guy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I guess the scary part is the fact that I was pretty into most of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;stuff before I first read about Extropians in Wired 2.10,</i><br>
<p>
Same here. I was into all these ideas as far back as I can remember. I<br>
wonder how many of the people on the list are the same way?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;although the idea of tying it all together with an optimistic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;future-minded, rational philosophy was new and compelling</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some will wonder why this my first post on the list for</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone who has followed extropianism for the last two years.</i><br>
<p>
I too followed extropianism for about a year via websites prior to my<br>
subscription to the list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I find myself in a bit of quandary.  Since I find myself</i><br>
<i>&gt;in agreement with the fundamental premises of Extropianism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can't help but be in general accord with most of what is  </i><br>
<i>&gt;said on the list.  To improve significantly on any of it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would take rather a lot of thought.  But original thought of course</i><br>
<i>&gt;takes time - I want to live Extropianism and not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk about it, so I've chosen to push on with my own studies and projects.</i><br>
<p>
Whenever you have the time, Feel free Wade.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Currently, I have various essays relevant to extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt;at various stages of completion that I hope to finish up</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the new year for putting on a web page I'm preparing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(I'm also working on a small molecular modelling program</i><br>
<i>&gt;that might be useful for the design of "nanowidgets")</i><br>
<p>
Beware. Make sure there is no misinterpretation of any material on your<br>
webpage especially regarding the modelling program. There have been website<br>
bashings lately.<br>
