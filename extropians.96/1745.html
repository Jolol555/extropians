<i> &gt; Then they put the people in a state of serfdom. Businesses don't need </i><br>

<i> &gt; Look at the clothing industry. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Not to deny that serf conditions exist in the unlaissez faire <br>
countries of the world, that produce products for the international <br>
capitalist market; however, capitalism in general is distinct from<br>
pre-capitalist serfdom due to that feature know as * mass production * <br>
under which products are made for the masses, as opposed to a few elite. <br>
This is precisely how capitalism raises the poor out of the pre-capitalist<br>
conditions of universal poverty and serfdom.<br>
<p>
It is not in the capitalist's interest to keep his products out of <br>
the hands of any group of consumers. the capitalist strives to bring<br>
the best product at the lowest price due to the impact of competition<br>
with other businesses who would also like attract/serve those customers.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;	Even in high tech, there is severe disparity in wages. Some</i><br>
<i> &gt; software companies import top-notch Indian programmers, keep them in</i><br>
<i> &gt; "software sweatshops" and pay them INDIAN wages. That strikes me as</i><br>
<i> &gt; grossly unfair, because more highly educated and skilled people are being</i><br>
<i> &gt; manipulated by sleazy managers.   </i><br>
<p>
IAN: A business will pay each worker as little as he is willing <br>
to except, just as you will pay each producer as little as he is <br>
willing to except. Folks from India are willing to except less <br>
than American workers because they, living in or coming from a <br>
heavily socialized economy, are poorer than Americans on average<br>
so this lesser wage is to them higher than the wage options.<br>
<p>
This wage disparity is purely rational, not even slightly unethical.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Okay, call me one of those crazy idealists, but what about if people</i><br>
<i> &gt; worked to better each other rather than only themselves. Science</i><br>
<i> &gt; innovations could be shared by the entire commune. Everybody is working</i><br>
<i> &gt; for the benefit of all. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: People do work for the benefit of other in a capitalist<br>
society. Ever heard of customer service ?  The whole function <br>
of the free market -- nongovt business -- is producing something <br>
for someone else. Yet people who oppose the market want things <br>
for free, without having to do anything for someone else.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I  think  cooperation can produce the best item for the lowest </i><br>
<i> &gt; price, simply because everyone contributes what they can. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Voluntary association is the definition of cooperation.<br>
There can be no cooperation free from consent. On the other hand,<br>
govt mandated collectivism is coercion and therefore is by definition<br>
antithetical to cooperation.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Cooperation would work so much better than</i><br>
<i> &gt; competition, because you get much more voluntary work. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Cooperation is not antithetical to competition; however,<br>
competition is antithetical to totalitarianism. Without competition<br>
there is not incentive to build the better mouse trap, no incentive<br>
to cut costs by reducing wasted effects and energy. Without competition<br>
there is only stagnation and poverty.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; My fundamental moral principle is that all forms of coercion are bad,</i><br>
<i> &gt; government and private property are pretty much the two biggest forms of</i><br>
<i> &gt; coercion I can think of. You know about government coercion, but who backs</i><br>
<i> &gt; up your right to property if not government. You and your superior</i><br>
<i> &gt; firepower. Blatant application of force. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: So if private property is bad, then its destruction must be good.<br>
Therefore it would be good for me to blow up you and your home, because <br>
both you and your home are items of your private property, which is<br>
good to abolish. <br>
