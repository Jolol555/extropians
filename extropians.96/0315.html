Yes, if they are internally-competitive (without a single strong world <br>
government).  If local technological advances run out, then the only route <br>
to growth is spatial expansion to other resources.  And generically <br>
evolution, of transhumans or anything else, pushes toward growth where <br>
possible (some mutation trys it, and wins thereby). "<br>
<p>
Even with our constrained meat minds, many of us still manage to grow wiser <br>
as we grow older, even as we consume fewer material resources.  Is this <br>
because our computational power is growing or because we have learned to <br>
make better connections, to abstract things to higher, more generalized <br>
levels?  Reilly Jones put this nicely in his Extropy #15 article on SO: "Our <br>
perspective must be broadened in order to find simplified contexts."  Or, as <br>
I recently quoted from Eric Lerner: "There is no inherent limit to evolution <br>
away from equilibrium, even within a fixed supply of energy, so long as a <br>
process can continually increase the efficiency with which it recycles the <br>
energy."<br>
<p>
I think intelligence is more a function of communication than computation. <br>
 As Anders Sandberg said, RE The Dividing Neuron, "The number of neurons in <br>
a brain doesn't correlate to its intelligence, it is the way they are linked <br>
together that is important."  So too, ever-increasing processing power is <br>
not necessarily extropic, especially when it wants to consume everything in <br>
its path!<br>
<p>
Robin Hanson refers to Niklas Bostrom's 8/13 7:00PM post: "If life developed <br>
independently on Earth and on Mars, what could block the conclusion that our <br>
far future is probably doomed? I can see only three potential answers: 1. <br>
[great filter] 2. Higher life forms continue to prosper but do not cause an <br>
'explosion' into cosmos. 3. Higher life forms do explode into cosmos, but in <br>
ways that are invisible to us. This would presumably mean that they do not <br>
engage in galactic scale constructions, and that they are not interested in <br>
contacting human level life."<br>
<p>
Regarding option 3, Robin replies: "But some of them should be interested in <br>
our raw mass and the sun's energy.  Unless it is always cheaper to get more <br>
mass/energy by creating a 'baby universe' or some such."  Of course *they* <br>
are *interested* in it; but, if they've transcended then why should they <br>
need to consume more and more material mass? I would think that the most <br>
successful evolutionary step would be to learn to use existing matter, as it <br>
is, as a distributed computing and communications medium. As Anders said: "I <br>
think that the 'natural order' is artificial: stars are power generators, <br>
galaxies are really computer nets and so on."<br>
<p>
Also, one of Greg Egan's major themes is that transcendant beings might <br>
prefer to run at a slower clock speed.  I know that I would personally <br>
prefer some sort of geologic time frame, being able to watch large scale <br>
structures / patterns evolve in *real time*, rather than endlessly computing <br>
ever more complex solipsist visions to the Omegath decimal place!  On <br>
balance I'm fairly satisfied with my current processing capabilities <br>
(although I do wish I had better control over the noise levels and easier <br>
access to non-local phenomena - but those are communication issues.) I'd be <br>
content to keep running my simulations and observations at the current clock <br>
speed (or slower), as long as there was no threat of degradation or sudden <br>
extinction.<br>
<p>
I don't think that Boundless Expansion implies explosion. Growth doesn't <br>
have to be an endless consumption of more and more resources. Transcended <br>
life forms could learn to live on endlessly elaborated information, not <br>
explosively manic energy consumption - unless you think that dinosaurs are <br>
more advanced life forms than humans.  As Reilly Jones might put it, <br>
*explosion* is a characteristic of the chaotic gaseous realm, while "the <br>
Extropic transformation is the complex (liquid) realm."<br>
<p>
This idea of boundlessly expanding by consuming ever more and more resources <br>
reminds me of Ralph Merkle's Extropy #11 vision of the first upload VR being <br>
a Roman orgy simulation!<br>
