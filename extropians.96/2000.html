I agree with you. However, because the Federal government has yet to start<br>
ignoring the constitutional guarantees of free migration and free trade<br>
between states, individual states will be much more easily punished (by<br>
emigrating people and corporations) for overlegislating than the Federal<br>
government can be. But US history is full of examples of individual states<br>
unconstitutionally and illegally abusing their powers during periods when<br>
the Federal government was powerless to stop them: in particular, there<br>
was the removal of the Cherokee nation to Oklahoma, which was carried out<br>
by the Federal government under Jackson, but *only* because Jackson was<br>
powerless (not enough money or troops) to prevent the Georgia state<br>
militia from systematically slaughtering the Cherokees, which is what<br>
probably would have happened had the Feds not removed them. <br>
<p>
I guess I'm a historical relativist here: right now the big threat in the<br>
US seems to be Federal power. I'm well aware that after this problem is<br>
successfully addressed, we will probably need to turn our attention to<br>
reining in the states. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, BTW, I think your reference to Friedman's interesting work on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Icelandic example, Eric,  bears out my original thesis regarding the relative</i><br>

<i>&gt; emigrating from Scandinavia to essentially unpeopled country.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. In fact, long before I heard of the extropians, I was a vaguely<br>
libertarian activist in the L5 Society. It eventually occurred to me that<br>
it was the current political situation that presented the greatest<br>
obstacle to space development. (Pouring half your gross world product down<br>
a government rathole can do that to a planet.) So I became more than<br>
"vaguely"  libertarian. Now you are telling me that it seems we'd have a<br>
much better chance of bringing about agorist social institutions on a<br>
frontier... and getting to the frontier was my whole motivator in the<br>
first place! So it seems to be a bit of a chicken and egg problem, which<br>
we must attack on several fronts at once, which is why I think ExI is so<br>
excellently conceived. <br>
