Good ideas...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;My point is that the resources won't come from the Moon. Aluminum, silicon,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;titanium, oxygen (though it's *very* tightly bound -- ever tried breathing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rocks?), and that's about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ouch!</i><br>
<p>
The thing is, those resources are some of the most valuable for space<br>
development. Additionally, there are extensive supplies of Helium III in<br>
lunar regolith, which is expected to be the best fuel for human built<br>
hot fusion systems. It is estimated that there is a minimum of $5<br>
trillion worth of He III on this side of the moon....<br>
<p>
Polar ices would have enough volatiles (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
etc.) to act as a startup resource, allowing sufficient infrastructure<br>
to be built to support sustained comet recovery operations for sustained<br>
supply. Remember, since we are dealing with a space environment, any<br>
colony is going to have 95% plus recycling rates for all resources. Any<br>
additional resource base will support entropic losses and feed futher<br>
expansion. Of course such small molecules as nitrogen will tend to<br>
outgass through the very walls of habitats, but if you read Larry Niven<br>
&amp; Jerry Pournelles book _Fallen_Angels_ you can adapt airsucking<br>
aerospace planes to operate as air dippers to acquire nitrogen resources<br>
without going back to earth surface.<br>
<p>
Oxygen is not "that" tightly bound in regolith. NASA engineers succeeded<br>
in building a solar furnace that can bake the oxygen out of regolith at<br>
a mere 600 Deg. So this is NOT that hard, if even NASA guys can do it.<br>
THere are also iron deposits on the moon, though not as good as earth<br>
resources, so even primitive linear mass drivers can be built. If<br>
Yittrium, Barium, and sufficient copper deposits are found,<br>
superconducting mass drivers are just a step away.<br>
