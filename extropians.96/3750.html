<i>&gt;From time to time there has been speculations, both on the list and on some</i><br>
websites, about how transhuman art will be. I'll just throw in my 2cents<br>
worth.<br>
<p>
To me art is a way to provoke thoughts and feelings that it would otherwise<br>
be very difficult to convey with logic and sense. Far out ideas preesented<br>
thru art seems to be more acceptable to most people. it's a great way to<br>
spread memes.<br>
<p>
This is not really what i want to talk about though. The thing is that i<br>
can see some parallel developments that i would like to share.<br>
Since '82 i have been playing techno music. As a natural consequence i have<br>
studied that artform very closely. Also i am quite familliar with the<br>
bussines side of it.<br>
<p>
What happened in mid to late seventies was that a few bands, mainly<br>
europeans,  started to experiment with completely electronic music.<br>
"Kraftwerk", "Jean Michell Jarre", to name a few. That started a period in<br>
the beginning of the eighties with european techno music. "Depeche Mode",<br>
"Soft cell", "DAF" etc. these bands all had a very electronic sound (my own<br>
bands to.) In the mid to late eighties there was a counter reaction inside<br>
the techno scene, where a lot of bands started to incorporate "natural"<br>
instruments in their sound. Now in the mid nineties it seems that the<br>
techno scene has found a level, where a few bands are playing purely<br>
electronic music, a lot are playing hybrid music a some simply play rock'n<br>
roll. So there is a very wide spectre of genres. Most of them seem to have<br>
a mix of "natural" and electronic sounds.<br>
<p>
As far as i can see this development is now taking place in the movie<br>
industri. A computergenerated movie like toy story has been a hit. A lot of<br>
companies are now working on movies made the same way. On the net there's<br>
also a lot of things going on with individuals making movies/animations in<br>
3D graphics. Soon there will be a plethora of 3D movies everywhere (you<br>
ain't seen nothing yet.) The next thing that will happen is that there will<br>
be movies that mixes 3D/2D computergraphics with real images. I don't talk<br>
about the hollywood thing where a lot of Special effects are done on<br>
computers and composited into the image, bur movies where it's obvious that<br>
the computergraphics are computergraphics. It will be a new Techno movie<br>
artform. Desktop movie productions.<br>
<p>
It will probably be a good way to promote transhuman/extropian ideas, as<br>
the audience for that kind of art probably will be some of the most<br>
receptive for the memes.<br>
<p>
Global underground distribution.<br>
Another thing that happened with techno was that no big labels were<br>
interrested in distibuting it. So a huge network of small independent (punk<br>
inspired) record labels made a huge "underground" distribution network<br>
between themself. The techno scene is now very global and it's become that<br>
way in a distributed, chaotic self-organising way.<br>
The same will probably happen with all of the underground<br>
multimedia/desktopvideo etc.<br>
<p>
Ace Of Base's 1. album cost 3000 dollars to record. It earned their<br>
independent record company about $200 Mill over a 2 year period How's that<br>
for a garage startup?<br>
