I think I'm starting to understand what Suresh Naidu is saying about private <br>
property.  He is maintaining the position that owning private property is a <br>
form of coercion since the ownership is maintained by force.  He also has <br>
indicated that if one person uses force against another, then the victim or <br>
their protectors are justified in using force to stop the attacker.  Now, what <br>
I don't understand is why it isn't blatently obvious to Suresh that private <br>
property is only maintained by force *when others try to forcefully take it <br>
from the rightful owner*.  If no one tried to steal the property that I have <br>
earned, I wouldn't have to defend it by force, but when people like Suresh <br>
come along who think they have some sort of right to what I have earned by my <br>
own work, they are the ones being coercive; I would only be defending myself <br>
when I maintain my property rights.  Owning private property is not a form of <br>
coercion, any more than living is.  To maintain my life from those who would <br>
take it, I must use force, so according to Suresh's logic, living is a <br>
coercive act, and no one must be allowed to live, for EXACTLY the same reasons <br>
he says no one should be allowed to own private property.<br>
<p>
In Suresh's world, no one would be allowed to own private property, because <br>
that would be a form of coercion, and if someone was committing that sort of <br>
coercive action, Suresh and his brute squad would be justified in using <br>
retalitory force to take the property away from those who would hoard it.  So, <br>
if I was living in Suresh's world, I could spend my day out in the fields, <br>
taking care of my crops and gathering some food to bring home to my family.  <br>
As I'm walking home, some people see the load of food I'm carrying and they <br>
tell me to share it with them.  I would refuse, and the people would cry out <br>
to Suresh and his brute squad and report that I was hoarding, that I was <br>
trying to own private property, which is a coercive act, according to Suresh.  <br>
The food I had worked all day gathering would be taken from me and distributed <br>
to the lazy beggars and my family would starve.  In Suresh's world, gathering <br>
food for one's family is a crime, while taking food from others is not.  Why <br>
the horrible immorality of Suresh's ideas aren't blatently obvious, is beyond <br>
my understanding.  But then, people often will defend their pet ideas beyond <br>
the point of reason.  "It seemed like such a good idea, surely it would work!" <br>
 <br>
<p>
But Suresh's logic is very flawed.  He is the coercive one.  He wants to steal <br>
from people what they have earned through their own labor.  Owning private <br>
property is not coercive, but taking it from people is.  And this is exactly <br>
what Suresh is proposing.  <br>
