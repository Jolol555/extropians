Michael Lorrey said, "I have NEVER been to a government run facility where I <br>
was communicated with in a freindly manner, or treated in any way like I was a <br>
human being. Unfortunately, I cannot take my government business elsewhere, as <br>
they currently enforce their monopoly quite strictly (i.e. Waco, Ruby RIdge, <br>
Justus Township), so they are not motivated to act any differently"<br>
<p>
I haven't noticed this phenomenon directly, but my mother once got a job <br>
working for our city's utilities company (the city generated its own power), <br>
and the other employees told her, "You don't have to be nice to people; they <br>
have to come here."  She was horrified by this attitude and by many other <br>
serious problems with the government workers who didn't really care about <br>
anyone and acted very rude and childish, so she quit the job after a few <br>
weeks.  <br>
<p>
It just goes to show that the government really DOESN'T CARE about people.  <br>
Why should they?  The workers pretty much keep their jobs no matter how poorly <br>
they perform or how rude they are to customers.  Their supervisors don't have <br>
anything to lose if the people they are in charge of perform badly.  Their pay <br>
won't be cut; they won't lose their job, it's just more work for them to try <br>
to change the behavior of those they are in charge of, work that they won't be <br>
rewarded for.  Some people have the discipline to do good work anyway, so <br>
there are exceptions, but there is no monetary motivation to excell, like <br>
there is in commerce.<br>
