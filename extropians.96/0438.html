I'm copying a post I sent to the &gt;H list, since it seems equally applicable<br>
to this list. (Max, I'll 'steal' your short review for this purpose, if you<br>
don't mind.)<br>

OK, then. I'd like to take this in the context of recent discussions about<br>
people discussing subjects about which they 'know' very little, and suggest<br>
the following.<br>
<p>
Just as Darren Reynolds is putting together a list of areas of expertise of<br>
people on this list and elsewhere, I'd like to put together a comprehensive<br>
transhuman reading list, but one covering a very broad range of areas:<br>
neuroscience, life extension, philosophy, economics, social sciences,<br>
genetics, fiction, etc.<br>
<p>
But to do this, I'll need the help of everyone on the list. For each<br>
submission I'll need:<br>
<p>
- the name of the book<br>
- the author<br>
- the publisher (if known)<br>
- a short description of the book, which should say:<br>
        - what it's about<br>
        - whether it's any good (yeah, that's subjective but I'm happy to<br>
          accept more than one description per book)<br>
        - what sort of level it's pitched at (no prior knowledge, basic<br>
working           knowledge, expert, etc.)<br>
- _one_ major category: neuroscience, genetics, electronics, economics, etc.<br>
- applicable minor categories<br>
<p>
Details of the book will be placed in the major category. The title of the<br>
book and its author will be placed in the minor categories, with appropriate<br>
links back to the major category entry.<br>
<p>
The list will be ordered by category, then by author. <br>
<p>
Each entry will also contain the name of the person submitting that entry:<br>
so send me your URL if you want a dynamic link to your home page.<br>
<p>
If the suggested reading is on-line (e.g. 'Engines of Creation'), then you<br>
should also send me the URL.<br>
<p>
If you wish to post a longer, more detailed review then I'll set up a<br>
separate web page for that particular book.<br>
<p>
I imagine the categories will build up as we go along. If I make a decision<br>
to place a book in an existing category, rather than place it in a suggested<br>
new one, I'll let you know I have done so, to give you a chance to object.<br>
<p>
I'm also aware that many of you already have lists of books on your pages.<br>
If you send me the URL for those lists, along with a brief description, I'll<br>
put them in a separate section of links on the book page. Alternatively, if<br>
you want your text incorporated into the main body of the list, I'll be<br>
happy to do that.<br>
<p>
If you think it's a good idea then mail me at the address at the bottom of<br>
the page. (If not, don't :-)<br>
<p>
I would hope that, rather than just form from a flurry of activity now (but<br>
please, feel free to flurry), the list will continue to build as we increase<br>
our knowledge.<br>
