                  <br>
<p>
Earth formed about 4.6 billion ago, but life didn't have a chance for it's <br>
first billion years or so, it was far too hot and the Earth suffered impacts <br>
so large  it would make the one that killed the Dinosaurs look like a joke. <br>
One popular theory about the formation of the moon is that about this time <br>
The Earth was hit by a Mars sized object, the ejected debris formed a ring <br>
around the earth that later coalesced into The Moon. Even rocks couldn't <br>
survive that, the oldest rocks ever found are the "Isua" rocks of south west <br>
Greenland and they are only 3.8 billion years old. Interestingly some reported <br>
signs of biological activity in the Isua rocks, but this interpretation<br>
remains highly controversial. The oldest undisputed fossils are a little over <br>
3.5 billion years old and were found in western  Australia and South Africa.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;Having got to this stage it was not easy to leave                         </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;it, life stayed stuck here for over 2 billion years.</i><br>
                        <br>
<i>                &gt;Only 1.7 billion years, actually.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Best estimate I've seen is that Eukaryotic cells evolved between 1.2 an 1.4  <br>
billion years ago, well over 2 billion years after the first life. Well OK, I <br>
remember reading a report somewhere about 1.6 billion, but I don't think <br>
that's generally accepted.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;For Great Filter issues, "hard" would be expected times of a                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;trillion years or more. An expected times 700my is far from                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;hard enough to matter.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Obviously we have zero chance of finding anything a trillion years old, but I <br>
don't think 700 million is a trivial percentage of life's 3.5 billion year <br>
history.         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The really hard stages, I think, do not cluster near us in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;time.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
If so then we must have successfully passed through the hard stages long ago,  <br>
it's hard for me to believe that we won't get to the really difficult stuff  <br>
for another billion years.<br>
