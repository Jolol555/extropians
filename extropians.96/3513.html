First, a correction to yesterday's post.  I wrote:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What we call the "singularity" (for lack of a better term) will not </i><br>
<i>&gt; happen by accident.  It will be brought about by someone who </i><br>
<i>&gt; intends to bring it about, ...</i><br>
<p>
I meant to say:  If it happens at all, it will be brought about by someone <br>
who intends to bring it about.  <br>
<p>
Chris asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; do you actually believe it yourself?  </i><br>
<p>
No.  I think the "Singularity" is a myth, an illusion, for reasons I have <br>
given in many earlier posts.  But I think numerous churches and cults <br>
will form around the idea.  They will of course deny being cults, as <br>
all cults do.  They will call themselves Memetic Engineers.  But calling <br>
Scientology "Memetic Enginerring" doesn't change its nature.  <br>
<p>
Eliezer Yudkowsky writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; THIS IS NOT PHILOSOPHY!</i><br>
<i>&gt; THIS IS MEMETIC ENGINEERING!  </i><br>
<p>
Then why are we wasting time on it?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's all remember that the Singularity may well be before 2000 </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, right.  <br>
<p>
I'm going to retire from the list.  Merry Christmas to all, and to all <br>
a good night!  <br>
