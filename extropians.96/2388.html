<p>
(Using an atomic scale monitor is hi-fi overkill, you get a resolution <br>
smaller than the wavelength of visible light)<br>
<p>
First, I would like to point out the work that has been done with<br>
custom-designed proteins and artificial enzymes; thats what nanotech is<br>
about, and the area shows great promise (and uses genengineering to get<br>
there too). I read about (Science News a few years back) a change in a<br>
bacterial protein that made it create small (20 atoms) crystals of<br>
uranium. <br>
<p>
Secondly, I would like to point out that there is a qualitative difference<br>
between the gears, wires and enzymes and the gene: we have reasonable<br>
control over the former, but we cannot use the genes to do very complex<br>
things. The cell is a nightmare of tangled interactions, where proteins<br>
switch on and off genes producing other proteins that are marked by<br>
enzymes becoming active making the cell do one thing and then switching on<br>
another switch making the cell produce morphogens that influence the<br>
neighbors to change their behavior... we can control a few genes we know<br>
have rather direct effects (like eye color and trombine production), but<br>
making cells differentiate and grow into something we want that isn't<br>
already coded somewhere is extremely nontrivial (i.e. nearly impossible)<br>
at present. We can make crippled fruit flies, but not a fruit fly that<br>
likes meat or have butterfly wings. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What you propose is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;roughly to create a customized multicellular lifeform,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What was the geep (goat+sheep) and glowing tobacco plant (firefly gene) all</i><br>
<i>&gt; about?</i><br>
<p>
The tobacco plant was a single gene, each cell expressed it (which is a <br>
waste, but who cares?), and the light emission didn't involve anything <br>
more complex than watering it with the right catalyst. <br>
<p>
The geep is more interesting, but wasn't it just a chimerical being (cells<br>
of two types)? Anyway, it is just a combination and its creators didn't<br>
have any special new properties in mind when it was created - it would be<br>
something completely different to make (say) a goat with feathers. <br>
