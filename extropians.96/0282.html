<p>
Aside from the possibility that space colonization is too hard (which<br>
seems doubtful; we already know how it could be done in principe and<br>
practice), this filter relies on that all species will be trapped by<br>
VR paradise. But this depends a lot on psychology, and might be an<br>
unique danger to our kind of species but not others (say, intelligent<br>
hive colonies or knots of flux-tubes in neutron stars). <br>
<p>

<p>
This is quite possible. My own answer is that we are too slow and <br>
stupid to be worth discussing with. The transcendent beings might be <br>
around, but wait until we rise to their level simply because it <br>
would be so tiresome to do anything about it. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;           manipulations of the universe a posthuman culture would find </i><br>
<i>&gt;           suitable. Also, there could perhaps be ethical/strategic </i><br>
<i>&gt;           reasons for not interfering to much with the natural order </i><br>
<i>&gt;           in cosmos.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps, but as Tipler points out, on this scale individuals could <br>
signal or make a visible mess. <br>
<p>
Sometimes I think that the "natural order" is artificial: stars are <br>
power generators, galaxies are really computer nets and so on. But <br>
how to tell natural and artificial apart?<br>
<p>
(I like your calculations (deleted for brevity), but we simply don't <br>
have enough data). <br>
