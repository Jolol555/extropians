Michael Lorrey,<br>
<p>
I can't argue with most of your last post.  Just one point:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Witnesses and the public statement of a DEMOCRAT who has long experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;in White House and other high level government business. 157 eye</i><br>
<i>&gt;witnesses corroborating each other is a much bigger statistical lump to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dismiss than just a few confused reports. If facts are not true, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically are widely varied in being described by witnesses. When they</i><br>
<i>&gt;all agree, that typically means that is accceptable as a fact.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I thought the witnesses said they saw what looked like a missile -- not<br>
that they specifically saw a missile fired by a US Navy vessel.<br>
<p>
BTW, I have never said the investigators should rule out the Navy as a<br>
possible suspect.  Honest investigators will go through many suspects, but<br>
hopefully they will only accuse the one who is actually guilty.<br>
<p>
But maybe I have missed something.  Please tell me what factual evidence<br>
there is that TWA Flight 800 was shot down by a Navy missile.  I still<br>
don't know who is the "AI" on this list, so maybe I also missed the Navy<br>
missile evidence.<br>
