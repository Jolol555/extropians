How long ago was that, if you don't mind me asking? :) <br>
<p>
The SATs have changed a lot since the first time I took them.  I first took<br>
my SAT when I was 10 (my freshman year in high school!), but my parents had<br>
to go through all sorts of hassles to have them let me take it at that age.<br>
And this was only 14 years ago (I am now 24).  We didn't have fractional<br>
scores though.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know how long the SATs have been given?<br>
