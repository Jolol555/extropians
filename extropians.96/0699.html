I dunno about you Anders, but my opinion is that Omega Point theories are<br>
depressing from what I was reading on your page about Tipler's idea that our<br>
mental processes can speed up to the point where the last seconds of the<br>
collapse of the universe can seem like an eternity. It just seems kinda<br>
depressing that it all *EVENTUALLY* would end. At least if we have uploading<br>
by 2030 we could already speed up our mental processes while the universe is<br>
expanding (not contracting) and the year after that could be equal to a<br>
million which gives us *PLENTY* of time to figure out FTL (faster than<br>
light) travel. Also how do we know we're not some type of product from a<br>
long-term von newman system made just so that we can evolve to fit the<br>
planet instead of engineering the planet to fit whoever sent out the von<br>
newman probe. I must agree though anders, I keep finding mind-opening ideas<br>
on that website of yours! Keep up the good work! Holy Spirit = Universal<br>
Wave Function (hehe) :)<br>
