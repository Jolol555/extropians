I often do use fixed-point numbers for floating point computation (32-bit<br>
int for fraction and 32 or 64-bit int for integer portion).  For some<br>
applications it is more convenient (and more accurate) to use fixed point<br>
calculations.  However, for some types of floating point intensive<br>
computation, I doubt this is the _fastest_ method.<br>

Granted, Fast fp RISC machines are expensive, but if you need a workstation<br>
with high-end fp capability, this is the way to go.  "Consumer" CPUs,<br>
especially SMP, will get you more bang for the buck, but SMP is only useful<br>
for a subset of computational problems.  The performance gap is getting<br>
pretty narrow though.  Using specmarks as a reference, the highest-end<br>
workstation CPUs only offer roughly twice the performance of the highest-end<br>
"consumer" CPUs.  For some classes of problems, a 4-way SMP P6 or PowerPC<br>
system would seriously out-perform many high-end workstations at a fraction<br>
of the cost.  Case in point:  An Intergraph P6 SMP graphics workstations<br>
(with custom acceleration hardware) will out-perform any SGI graphics system<br>
costing less than $100k.  The Intergraph system will only cost you $25k<br>
because it uses off the shelf components, with the sole exception of the<br>
hardware accelerator (which is compatible with any NT workstation).  <br>
<p>
I think this convergence of performance will kill a significant number of<br>
the RISC vendors unless prices converge as well.<br>

<p>
I never really thought about it in this sense.  I suppose it WOULD be<br>
possible to pipeline integer CPUs to get fast floating point performance.<br>
It probably never occurred to me because this is contrary to conventional<br>
thinking.  <br>
<p>
This could be the basis for a flexible, fast computing architecture.<br>
Pipeline simple 128-bit (or even 256-bit) ALUs.  The ALUs, by nature, would<br>
be really small, simple, and very fast.  You could build a simple floating<br>
point processor with many parallel pipelines using less than &gt;1 million<br>
transistors (trivial these days).  The fp throughput would be enormous, and<br>
I suspect that you could build a veritable supercomputer on a chip or MCM<br>
this way.  And depending on how it was designed, you could have arbitrary<br>
hardware supported precision, up to the point of the total number of<br>
pipelines on the chip or MCM.<br>
