<i>&gt;&gt; Don't point that finger at _me_!  I don't forward that stuff to lists;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; one or two people I know well with whom I regularly exchange such things,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; maybe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If one of those people with whom you exchange such things sent you a</i><br>
<i>&gt;cute chain letter which s/he had received, would it annoy you because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was a chain letter and they were replicating it?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  But since it was a friend I would send a polite note reminding them<br>
that I don't want any forwarded chain letters and please not to send me<br>
any more.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Call it a (possibly vain) attempt to exercise some control over my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; informational (as opposed to physical) environment.  And did it ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; occur to you that junk mail might just piss some people off?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are chain letters somehow worse than other junk mail?</i><br>
<p>
Not really, but I attack where I can.  I don't expect institutions to<br>
listen.  Individuals I can influence.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; There's an element of presumption in a chain letter; it says, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; effect, "I think you are a person who would be interested in this".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Isn't any attempt at communication based on that presumption?</i><br>
<p>
People can ask and get feedback.  Chain letters are thrown out at random<br>
with, as they say, ne'er a by-your-leave.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...replication processes by which chain letters survive almost guarantees</i><br>
<i>&gt;that any which I might receive will be of interest to me. Something in</i><br>
<i>&gt;their content has made them work as memetic viruses, and finding out</i><br>
<i>&gt;just what that something is interests me greatly.</i><br>
<p>
Study all you want -- just don't encourage them (write them, forward them,<br>
or answer them), OK?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Likewise, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested in what I perceive to be a growing immunity to them as</i><br>
<i>&gt;expressed by the feelings of yourself and others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Immunity through limited contact.  As soon as I realize something is<br>
a chain letter, I delete it without reading it.  I delete executables<br>
that people mail me, too. It's like not shaking hands with someone<br>
who has a cold.  I guess sending the note to the friend is kind of<br>
like suggesting that someone wash their hands before handling food.<br>
