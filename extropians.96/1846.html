<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;If being extropian means checking my emotions at the door, than,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;fine, I should seek other fora.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        No, it doesn't mean you should check your emotions at the door.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt;appears to me, you are checking *other* peoples' emotions at the door.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think people have a right to their opinions.  This list is for people to</i><br>
<i>&gt;discuss their *extropian* opinions.</i><br>
<p>
I've been going over thoughts such as these and have concluded that there<br>
are multiple values creating conflicts on this list, to name a few:<br>
<p>
Message Depth vs Message Bredth<br>
Confirm Beliefs vs Evolve Beliefs<br>
Emotion over Logic vs Logic over Emotion<br>
<p>
I agree with everything on the right side of those listed. And my belief is<br>
that we should think logically and then act emotionally as opposed to act<br>
emotionally then logically. Emotion over Logic leads to violent outbursts of<br>
emotion which usually leads to nothing but arguments leading nowhere. Using<br>
logic to think and then act with emotion is the better more rational route.<br>
All this points to EQ I suppose. Emotion is mere entertainment from my<br>
viewpoint. Emotion comes from the ancient reptilian brain deep within your<br>
cranium where logic is fresh and new and one of the higher forms of thought<br>
to help us rationalize and use tools. Why deny the fact that emotion is<br>
vistigial (sp?) and only for mere entertainment now that we have logic?<br>
