*This is not a direct response to either Damien's query or Anders'<br>
response; but, since I just responded to another post regarding Tipler's<br>
"Physics of Immortality", and since I have my 'archives' open, maybe a<br>
dump of some more of my notes on this might be of interest.*<br>
<p>
10/20/94. Reading ch.10 of "Physics of Immortality" wherein Tipler<br>
describes "What Happens After the Resurrection: Heaven, Hell &amp;<br>
Purgatory" noting that "all possible combinations of resurrected dead<br>
can be placed in the same simulation and allowed to interact". I argue<br>
that such resurrections would be chimeras, not representing actual<br>
historical persons, because the Omega Point could not possibly know,<br>
which of many possible simulations actually happened. In fact, as he<br>
suggests, "the Omega Point would be able to advise us on possible<br>
imperfections"; so, the result would not be anything representing a<br>
resurrection of historical personalities. In fact, as he proves using<br>
game theory and Becker's notions of utility functions, such resurrected<br>
beings would be more altruistic than (and thus not identical to) us<br>
mortal beings in a world of finite resources.<br>
<p>
Tipler uses the notion of infinity to resolve the Tristram Shandy and<br>
Hilbert's Hotel paradoxes, essentially implying that infinity can<br>
accomodate all possible permutations; therefore, whatever actually<br>
happened historically will eventually happen in the final emulation. I<br>
grant this; but, I still ask, how will the Omega Point KNOW which of<br>
these infinite combinations of phase trajectories represents the<br>
actualized past and is, thus, a 'true' resurrection.<br>
<p>
Tipler discusses the problem of Evil and God's responsibility, the<br>
principle of nonsatiation, and theodicy. Using Hayek's theories<br>
regarding 'the supply of capital', he concludes that "Any cosmology with<br>
progress to infinity will necessarily end in [infinite wealth] God." I<br>
can accept this and don't question what the Omega Point can/will<br>
accomplish. What I question is whether this will represent a genuine<br>
resurrection, and eternal life, for ALL those who HAVE lived and died<br>
during the actual light cone of this Earth. As he notes, "It is not even<br>
necessary for ANY of the past to be repeated." Thus, while my life<br>
experience IN GENERAL will certainly be emulated by the Omega Point, it<br>
is impossible for the Omega Point to emulate my life experiences IN<br>
PARTICULAR by any 'brute-force' simulation. Therefore, unless I dismiss<br>
myself as a simple instance of some universal pattern of experience, I<br>
can not expect an individual resurrection in the Omega Point.<br>
<p>
According to the Law of Mass Action, I am indistinguishable from<br>
multitudes of others who have followed my same general pattern of<br>
development. The Omega Point will not recall the physical specifics and<br>
random fluctuations of my life, just as my memory does not store<br>
everything it experiences; but (due to data compression economics), is<br>
capable only of accessing certain general archetypes, i.e, normalized<br>
relations and experiences. So, this means there is no personal<br>
resurrection, only resurrection of principals, of 'spirits'. If I am one<br>
who strives toward an altruistic ideal, this will be satisfactory; in<br>
other words, I will be resurrected in 'heaven'. However, if I am one who<br>
strives to be unique, or who is basically Narcisistic in my experiences,<br>
I can expect no resurrection at all, only the damnation of eternal<br>
return, stuck in an infinite loop, or perhaps I will simply be treated<br>
as noise and be deleted from the 'Final Reality'.<br>
