<i>&gt;If such agents exist everywhere, you can jump between them, of course. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Who needs Star Trek beamers, if you can simply move about your frame of </i><br>
<i>&gt;reference, basically with the speed of light (accomodate some link </i><br>
<i>&gt;buildup and channel latency).</i><br>
<p>
Telepresence decentralizes the idea of a physical body and uploading will<br>
eventually kill the concept entirely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Moreover, lots of people will still insist of dragging their bodies </i><br>
<i>&gt;around, if simply to take a swim, and to bask on the beach for a while.</i><br>
<p>
Of course which is why we need a swift physical transportation method as<br>
well. We still need to transport goods from place to place don't we?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;* Not everyone will tune in to your AR advertisements, but everyone will </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;see your huge hologram. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And what are means to generate such a hologram, pray? Phase array optics </i><br>
<i>&gt;(which require strong nanotech) excluded, I don't see any possibility </i><br>
<i>&gt;(image generator, computational power) to create animated holograms.</i><br>
<p>
Seen the recent developments in eyeglassless 3D television?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think it will be a wearable augmented reality, where you are carrying </i><br>
<i>&gt;your computational environment with you.</i><br>
<p>
How about augmented reality contacts created with nano or perhaps chips<br>
surgically implanted in your eyes?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Take off the magical </i><br>
<i>&gt;glasses, and all you see is a jungle of drab boxes, antennae and a </i><br>
<i>&gt;tangle of glass fibre. Don them again, and a Gibsonian matrix </i><br>
<i>&gt;unfolds around you. Avatars and agents stride ghostlike, you see </i><br>
<i>&gt;data dynamics surging through representations of comm channels. </i><br>
<p>
I always wondered how the world would look if we became dependent on<br>
augmented reality and you took your glasses off. Pretty boring and probably<br>
even falling into disrepair and decay because you wouldn't need to repair<br>
something until its nearly ready to break. This could be the transition<br>
where the physical world we've created falls into disrepair and decay and<br>
nature recovers from industrial age-induced entropy while the human race<br>
views only progress. Eventually we will upload and remove ourselves from<br>
nature entirely and we will allow the planet to return to the wilderness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;After a while, Au. R. will become a richer environment. You'll start </i><br>
<i>&gt;missing things if you plug in too rarely. Apart from wireheads, many </i><br>
<i>&gt;people will work in Au. R -- the step from a mouse pusher, to 6dof cursor </i><br>
<i>&gt;pusher is not too far ;)</i><br>
<p>
6dof cursor pusher? What do you mean?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's the logical choice, the next GUI.</i><br>
<p>
True<br>
