<p>
No, the tragic death of Drexler might even have the opposite effect by <br>
creating media attention.<br>
<p>
Here is a more realistic scenario, based on an upcoming paper about<br>
scenario planning (this is the "House of Cards" scenario): <br>
<p>
An international stock market crash occurs for one reason or another<br>
(Earthquake in Tokyo, Bill Gates converts to Islam or a little computer in<br>
Ulan Bator gets a stupid idea); this upsets the world economy a lot, and<br>
several influential banks or insurance companies crash or get into serious<br>
trouble. This causes a feedback - for example, all insurance companies are<br>
cross-insured, and if one goes down the others will feel the<br>
repercussions. <br>
<p>
The economic chaos affects the national economies and currencies badly. <br>
Many customers find their savings inaccessible or even gone, a lot of<br>
companies are forced into layoffs. A new depression seems imminent, but it<br>
has appeared much faster than anybody had planned for, and it is almost<br>
impossible to do anything constructive against it (whether this is true or<br>
not doesn't matter, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy). In developing<br>
nations things turn very nasty, since foreign capital suddenly vanishes<br>
together with the market of many export products (like coffee or cacao).<br>
Things are not much better in the industrialized world, since there are a<br>
large group of unemployed, suddenly poor people who have not enough<br>
savings, will not get enough wellfare (since the government is busy having<br>
to save the remaining banks, the currency and keep vital installations<br>
running) and beside have lost all confidence in the official currencies. <br>
<p>
As violence and poverty rise, many people band together into communities<br>
for mutual protection and survival. This of course makes the state even<br>
jumpier, and it has to prevent these communities from becoming too<br>
powerful, otherwise it will loose its remaining control - and of course,<br>
sending out the police and military consts valuable resources, which makes<br>
the situation worse. And when things really start getting bad people<br>
become even more desperate... <br>
<p>
The end result, when we played out this scenario, was a world dominated by<br>
many more or less independent agrarian communities focused on staying<br>
alive, most strongly defended or part of neo-feudal states. Long range<br>
trade will probably return in the future, but it will take a long time. <br>
Mongolia suddenly looks like a developed country in this world - they are<br>
good at horsemanship, independent and self-sufficient. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, advanced research and development is practically impossible<br>
(ever tried to do genetic engineering without access to purified enzymes? <br>
Or how do you rebuild the internet when electricity is a scarce<br>
commodity?). Drexler and us are (if we are lucky) building generators or<br>
tending the sick. <br>
<p>
No, this may not prevent the Singularity from appearing later, but it <br>
will delay it considerably. You could of course make this scenario even <br>
darker by assuming bioweapons or similar tricks, but a global market <br>
crash can be bad enough. <br>
