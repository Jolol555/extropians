Hal says:<br>
<i>&gt;I think you are saying here that you agree that in the shooting room</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment as I described it, the observers would be justified in expecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;to see the double sixes with 90% probability.  But if did another kind</i><br>
<i>&gt;of experiment where we just put some people in a room and rolled some</i><br>
<i>&gt;dice, in that case we'd be back to 1/36.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It still seems strange to me to imagine being one of the people in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the shooting room.  I am about to watch someone roll a perfectly fair</i><br>
<i>&gt;pair of dice, yet I expect this totally unlikely outcome to occur with</i><br>
<i>&gt;90% probability!  It seems almost magical, as though an unseen hand is</i><br>
<i>&gt;reaching out to manipulate the rolling dice and bring them up double</i><br>
<i>&gt;sixes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
No you don't.  What you expect is a 1/36 chance of being in a 90% majority<br>
(out of a group of size X) that sees the dice come up sixes, and a 35/36<br>
chance of being in a 10% minority (out of a group of _at least_ size 10X)<br>
that never sees sixes.  The numbers are approximate, but I hope they get<br>
the idea across.<br>
