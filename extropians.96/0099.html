Hey, I hate being coerced as much as anyone.  I want to be allowed<br>
to drop acid, to kill myself, to modify my brain with experimental<br>
electronic circuitry.  <br>
<p>
Freedom is an important value.  But there are other important values<br>
too, such as compassion, and -- yes -- growth (progress? extropy?)....<br>
In shaping a society we humans try to balance out these different values.<br>
Increasing our share of one often seems to decrease our share of another.<br>
That's what makes it difficult.  Libertarianism seems to result from<br>
exalting freedom over all other values.  But even if one DOES exalt<br>
freedom over all other values, it is not clear that eliminating government<br>
would result in increased freedom anyway -- the state is obviously only<br>
one kind of coercive power, and it serves, among other positive and<br>
negative functions, to keep a hold on other coercive powers.<br>
<p>
An interesting point, to me, is that when we move to a TRANS-HUMAN<br>
society, the balance between these different values will be different.<br>
I think the basic values will NOT change -- freedom, growth and compassion,<br>
for example, are fairly universal things, not tied to our carbon bodies in<br>
any essential way (I think).  But the parameters governing the balance<br>
of parameters against each other will change.<br>
<p>
So, for instance, freedom should be WAY easier to achieve in a cyber-society,<br>
because the limitation of the 2-D surface of the earth will be removed.<br>
It will be much easier for like-minded intelligences to "group" themselves<br>
in such a way as to minimize interactions with other intelligences they<br>
would rather not see.  (Now we have particular cities full of gays and<br>
lesbians; particular countries full of Muslims, Jews, etc. -- but the<br>
partitioning is very crude, not just because space is limited, but because<br>
of the manifold particularities of human life on 2-D earth.)<br>
<p>
On the other hand, oppression might be much easier to achieve in<br>
cyber-society too.  Imagine a Hitler who had control over people's<br>
REALITIES!!!  ... over the bit-patterns constituting their minds!!!<br>
<p>
Everything we know about politics now -- libertarianism, Democrats,<br>
Republicans, communists, socialists, etc. -- is implicitly conditioned<br>
on human biology and 2-D earth life.  Each of these sociopolitical systems<br>
represents a certain balance among important values, emphasizing some<br>
and de-emphasizing others.  But the way the balances work out is going<br>
to change when we leave our bodies behind!  \<br>
<p>
And this change in the balance of SOCIAL values is going to change our<br>
MINDS too.  This makes estimating the psychological effects of<br>
"downloading" exceedingly difficult, doncha think?<br>
