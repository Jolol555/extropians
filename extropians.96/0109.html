Given this way of defining the terminology, what I call "intrinsic" is<br>
probably what Rand would've called "subjective", and I'm not in significant<br>
disagreement with her about the nonexistence of what she referred to as<br>
"intrinsic" values.<br>
<p>
For me, intrinsic just means "not instrumental". Different people have<br>
different intrinsic goals, and generally this is what they love doing.<br>
Mathematicians love to do math, bicyclists love to cycle, artists love to<br>
make art, gardeners love to garden, scientists love to do science, cooks<br>
love to cook, programmers love to program, and philosophers love to<br>
philosophize. When these things are done best, they are done "for<br>
themselves", and not as instruments to some further end. So even though a<br>
mathematician's value for mathematical beauty and an artist's value for<br>
artistic creation are, in their "highest" form, not instrumental to any<br>
further end, I don't want to seem to demean these kinds of values (which I<br>
think are very important) by calling them "subjective". Yet it's also<br>
widely recognized that it is somewhat demeaning to these activities and<br>
purposes to insist that they serve as a means to some further "functional"<br>
end (although they very often do, over and above their intrinsic worth).<br>
Hence, I call them "intrinsic", but I accept them as diverse givens. It's<br>
possible that they are subjective, but I don't want to call them that<br>
because "subjective" has been heaped with bad and misleading connotations.<br>
<p>
I've never cared too much for the subjective/objective distinction. (This<br>
is why I use "intrinsic" in a different sense than Rand used: so I can<br>
avoid the word "subjective".) For any particular philosophical problem, the<br>
s/o distinction usually seems to melt away the closer you try to look at<br>
the boundaries. But not only is it a confusing distinction, it's also one<br>
that people get personally invested in, and that tends to degrade the<br>
quality of discourse.<br>
