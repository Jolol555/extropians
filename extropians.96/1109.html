"Within a Darwinian framework I find it hard to consider the workings of<br>
nature as a gestalt entity; rather, it seems to be a series of<br>
interacting events in which there is no prior assessment of effect, no<br>
plan. So 'nature' doesn't look at a problem in any direction at all."<br>

[On 9/17/96 Eugene Leitl responded:]<br>
"One common view of Darwinian evolution is population drift on a<br>
multidimensional fitness landscape ... in a certain sense one can speak<br>
of a gestalt ... the Darwinian evolution leaves a stamp of purposeful<br>
design on its products."<br>
<p>
Eugene is probably speaking of the work of Stuart Kaufmann, among<br>
others. Research into the processes of evolution also involves: cellular<br>
automata simulations (Stephen Wolfram: "cellular automaton evolution<br>
concentrates the probabilities for particular configurations, thereby<br>
reducing entropy. This phenomenon allows for the possibility of<br>
self-organization by enhancing the probabilities of organized<br>
configurations and suppressing disorganized configurations"); genetic<br>
algorithms in complex adaptive systems (where there's a little more<br>
going on than simply natural selection and mutation - See John Holland's<br>
recent book "Hidden Order".)<br>
<p>
Though I haven't studied it, there is also Robert Rosen's work.  He is a<br>
mathematical biophysicist and the author of "Life Itself: A<br>
Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life"<br>
(1991, check amazon.com).  I am only vaguely familiar with Rosen through<br>
Paul Davies' 1988 classic, "The Cosmic Blueprint", where Rosen is cited<br>
as saying (ch.11):<br>
<p>
"far from being universal, the conceptual foundation of what we<br>
presently call theoretical physics is still very special; indeed, far<br>
too much so to accommodate organic phenomena (and much else besides)....<br>
In particular, complex systems may contain subsystems which act as<br>
predictive models of themselves and/or their environments, whose<br>
predictions regarding future behaviors can be used for modulation of<br>
present change of state.  Systems of this type act in truly anticipatory<br>
fashion, and possess novel properties."<br>
<p>
Davies also points out that "Rosen explicitly introduces the idea that I<br>
have called software laws ... the quantities that change will be<br>
informational in nature."  Davies then goes on to describe "wilder<br>
ideas", like synchronicity, or nonlocality, and Rupert Sheldrake's<br>
morphogenetic fields.  That's too big a subject to go into here<br>
(although I do have a review of F.David Peat's 1987 book "Synchronicity"<br>
that could be posted if there was any interest).<br>
<p>
The implications of these latest theories of evolution &amp; physics take us<br>
far beyond the simplistic entropy and heat death scenarios of<br>
traditional physics (note that Rosen is explicitly saying that complex<br>
adaptive systems cannot be modeled as Markov processes, which is a basic<br>
assumption in Frank Tipler's "Physics of Immortality", for example) with<br>
its study of 'closed' systems to explain how, as in John Holland's<br>
recent title, "a hidden order" (Maxwell's immortal demon, at last<br>
perhaps?) emerges from evolution, not only in living systems, but also<br>
in many of those that we currently regard as non-living.  Taken to one<br>
extreme, these cellular automaton theories seem to indicate that<br>
material objects are *just* the 'pixels' on the 'display screen' of what<br>
Rudy Rucker has called "an incompressible computation by a fractal<br>
cellular automaton of inconceivable dimensions," that is, our universe.<br>
<p>
Some recent posts have claimed that the universe is compressible because<br>
it contains so much space, ignoring that this 'space' is far from empty,<br>
being filled with sundry species of cosmic rays and 'vital' dust<br>
(archives of the universe?)<br>

"Moravec enthusiastics might want to read my recent interview of Hans in<br>
the new issue of [11/96] Rage ... Moravec talks about<br>
mind-as-attribution, self as mechanism, how to tell whether we're living<br>
in a virtual reality, and the virtual recreation of history."<br>
<p>
[I wish I could find this interview, but, in the mean time, on 9/21/96<br>
Alexander Chislenko wrote ('Carriers &amp; Runners'):]<br>
"When software and nanotech gain enough control over matter so that<br>
physical objects would be all in flux, created and disassembled on the<br>
whim of immortal functional entities, will that mean that software will<br>
be 'running' hardware?"<br>
<p>
This could, in theory, already be what's going on.  As Sasha asks, "Did<br>
the debate of what carries what ever make sense?"  Minsky doesn't seem<br>
to 'get this' (based on Sasha's discussion), but perhaps Moravec does. <br>
For example, at the end of his Extropy #10 "Pigs in Cyberspace" article<br>
Moravec says: "The very moment we are now experiencing may actually be<br>
(almost certainly is) such a distributed mental event [a virtual<br>
recreation by someone else?], and most likely never happened<br>
physically."<br>
<p>
This is a pretty radical point of view, which could imply that we're<br>
just sort of 'dumb radios', ecstatically frying our brain circuits and<br>
unzipping our genes, pretty-much oblivious to the programs that are<br>
currently being broadcast thorugh us by higher-level distributed<br>
intelligences?  If this is the case, then Moravec's earlier statement in<br>
the same essay, where he assumes that "only a fraction of existing<br>
matter and space is doing interesting work, [while] in a well-developed<br>
cyberspace every bit will be part of a relevant computation or storing a<br>
useful datum," may be a bit premature.  We ignore the  incompleteness of<br>
our present physical theories at our peril.<br>
<p>
Indeed, I'm worried about the attitude toward evolution expressed by<br>
John K. Clark and others.<br>
<p>
[On 9/20/96 John K. Clark wrote (The Singularity and Nanotechnology:]<br>
"Life is a nanotechnology, sort of, but it's a very primitive, very<br>
stupid sort of one. It's not surprising that life is dumb, considering<br>
that the processes that made it had no mind at all, just random mutation<br>
and natural selection."<br>
<p>
In remedying this, Dr. Rich Artym also looks forward to a singularity<br>
provided by nanotechnology "where everything costs nothing ... when<br>
everyman can create cross-continental engineering works."  Even if<br>
nanotech can do everything we want, there's still a limited geospace, at<br>
least here on Earth, that wouldn't allow  billions of 'everymen' to<br>
build their own cross-continental tinker toys without running into each<br>
other and dealing with various economic tradeoffs.  As for Rich's "Guy<br>
Fawkes scenario [of] honeycombing the Earth's crust with communication,<br>
water and raw materials pipelines", this *already exists*.  It's called<br>
acquifiers (filled with lots of living organisms), mineral deposits,<br>
tectonic fault lines, etc.  Yes, I know you're talking about something<br>
more *sophisticated*, my point is that there are potential 'nanites'<br>
already living there, we just don't control them (yet :).<br>
<p>
It's this "pave it over" rather than "learn to use it" attitude that<br>
worries me.<br>
<p>
"What's the difference between improving us and improving our tools?<br>
Aren't tools just extensions of ourselves?" asks Lyle Burkhead in his<br>
9/21/96 post on why "molecular engineering will merely be an adjustment<br>
within the existing economy," rather than the radical singularity<br>
expected by Dr. Rich Artym and John K. Clark.  Robin Hanson agrees that<br>
this natural, market transition "seems the simplest scenario to expect."<br>
 Hara Ra, on the other hand (9/21/96), worries that "perhaps the great<br>
filter lies ahead ... A truly viscious grey goo may be hard to resist<br>
indeed..."<br>
<p>
A grey goo, I would suggest, that is driven by this "pave it over"<br>
attitude, the opposite extreme of the "100% natural" meme by saying that<br>
everything 'natural' is 'stupid' and needs to be reoptimized for the use<br>
of (trans)humans or SIs, 'primitive' life be damned.  This is especially<br>
dangerous when combined with the attitude that nanotech is going to be<br>
"as simple as programming a washing machine."<br>
<p>
[On 9/18/96 Sarah Marr wrote:]<br>
"[With nature] There's nobody looking ahead ... it's just trial and<br>
error."<br>
<p>
There's a valid concern expressed here about not personifying nature,<br>
but that doesn't mean we're left only with basic mechanical physical<br>
laws to describe things.  As I hope the quotes from Wolfram and Rosen<br>
illustrate, there are ways for natural systems to look ahead (unless you<br>
just wash your hands and say there's going to be a singularity), and I'm<br>
not just talking about human systems here.  To assume that only human<br>
systems can look ahead (yes, we may be the best at it, but is it a<br>
qualitative difference from other forms of life?) is to maintain the<br>
false dichotomy between man and nature that David Musick originally<br>
tried to debunk when he started this thread.<br>
<p>
Given my predilection for dynamic optimism, somehow I never thought I<br>
might end up agreeing with Robin Hanson's charge that if we assume that<br>
the great filter is in the future "we should become obsessively focussed<br>
on finding and avoiding disaster scenarios".<br>
