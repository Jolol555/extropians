<i>&gt; you would eventually reach a point where I would have to agree that God does</i><br>

<p>
Actually, the "God" concept that David is proposing would be both at<br>
once. <br>
<p>
It would Omnipotent to the extent that it created everything within this<br>
simulated universe, and could concievably halt, modify, recode, etc to<br>
suit, possibly without the sub-U's inhabitants noticing. Of course were<br>
it running these simulations as computational devices, it would<br>
obviously wish to run them start to finish without interruption, like<br>
any scientist would. It would however be limited in that it could not<br>
interfere in the internal operation during simulation without complying<br>
with the internal rules of that simluation.<br>
<p>
It would also be omniscient within that simulation, in that it would<br>
neccessarily have a complete understanding of the entire workings of<br>
that simulation. If it were able to observe the simluation's time<br>
sequence separte from its own temporal progression, it would also know<br>
both the beginning and the end, or any point in between, at the same<br>
time, which would be good for U-prime's computer operating speed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When I tell people that I am an atheist I've had some respond contemptuously</i><br>
<i>&gt; and say "Oh, so you don't think anything is greater than yourself". Sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; flattering really, what they're saying is that the only thing greater than me</i><br>
<i>&gt; is God. Bertrand Russell said something relevant to this "Many people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to abandon the idea of God, but very few are willing to abandon the</i><br>
<i>&gt; word "God".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;When we are very advanced, it is likely that we will be able</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;to create mini-universes (sometimes called "baby universes").</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it's a possibility, but I see no reason why the beings in such a universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have to be our intellectual inferiors.</i><br>
<p>
They would not need to be. That is your own assumption. If we are<br>
capable of eventually reaching this point ourselves, then we would<br>
necessarily be its equals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Perhaps universes which exhibit life, intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;creativity will be especially useful to us, and we will</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;seek to create living, intelligent universes, so that we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;use their intelligence to help us solve problems, much like</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;we use transistors in computer systems to help us solve</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;problems now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another possibility, but it would be a very poor sort of god indeed if He</i><br>
<i>&gt; needed us to help him figure things out. Colleague would be a better word than</i><br>
<i>&gt; God.</i><br>
<p>
Do you treat your computer like your colleagues, can you delete them or<br>
run them at will?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The universes we create would probably develop through</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But why would we use Darwin's style of Evolution with its horrible random</i><br>
<i>&gt; mutation and natural selection? Evolution by the inheritance of acquired</i><br>
<i>&gt; characteristics was long ago found not to occur in nature. It's too bad,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it would be a wonderful consolation to know that the muscular body you</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked so hard to develop, would make your children strong too. How splendid</i><br>
<i>&gt; it would be if your offspring were born knowing everything you struggled to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn during your life. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way in our world,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Shakespeare's daughter had to start from square one and learn how to hold a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pen and make sense from squiggles written on paper, Einstein's son had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; reinvent the wheel and rediscover that 2 +2 = 4.</i><br>
<p>
If we were eventually able to create pocket universes that exhibited<br>
better computational capability than our own, through better inheritance<br>
of information, then we would be demonstrably the intellectual superior<br>
to the U-Prime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Besides being less cruel, Lamarck's type of evolution would be much faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; than Darwinian evolution, that's why social evolution is so much swifter than</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological evolution.</i><br>
<p>
Yet Social evolution is happening in this universe, even though it took<br>
eons of bioligical evolution to get to a point where it became possible.<br>
It IS part of the simulation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;John, I don't know if your athiestic dogmatism allows you to</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;think clearly, but why do you insist that we will be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;first ones to create universes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We may not be the first, but until the evidence suggests otherwise it's wise</i><br>
<i>&gt; to assume the simplest theory as your working hypothesis.</i><br>
<p>
What is the simplest theory that actually axplains everything? If you<br>
have one, you deserve the Nobel, cause I haven't heard it....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Just to make it clear (for the dogmatically intoxicated and</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;mentally impaired): I'm not saying this being is omnipotent;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;I'm just saying that it is a conscious being who is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;powerful, powerful enough to create universes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then why call this being "God"? You must know that it is burdened with</i><br>
<i>&gt; more baggage than any other word in the English language.</i><br>
<p>
What? John, I thought you were the premier taboo buster around these<br>
parts! Such preconceptions should not burden you. We use the word<br>
"computer" everyday in ways completly divorced from its original meaning<br>
(a job description for a person with a slide rule). Creating a new<br>
definition for God should be an easy step....<br>
