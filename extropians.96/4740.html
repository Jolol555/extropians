<i>&gt;&gt; timescales we are using for the evolution of transhumans is too small for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; evolutionary development.  While our DNA may be appropriate for modern</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; humans, it is not appropriate for transhumans, and the influence is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; observable in a larger context, no matter how well extropian transhumanists</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>

To which Michael Lorrey responded:<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would say that the only error is your assumption that technology has</i><br>
<i>&gt;had no impact on our behavior. The easiest proof of the opposite would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be to examine the impact of weapons technology on social structures. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;introduction of the gun for example, made armor, swords, spears, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;castles obsolete, thus heralded the end of fuedal aristocracy which</i><br>
<i>&gt;arose out of such technology. The industrial demands of gun technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessitated  industrial chemistry, mass production, efficient power</i><br>
<i>&gt;generation technology, and efficient urban centers. This is only one</i><br>
<i>&gt;example.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Human behavior is shaped by the technology that is used. just look at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the past few decades. Living at the brink of nuclear extinction for so</i><br>
<i>&gt;long has had enough of an impact to make people really see the</i><br>
<i>&gt;usefullness of worldwide peaceful cooperation as opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;imperialistic rivalry. This is one of the greatest behavioral changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever and it happened right under your nose.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We extropian transhumanists are as individuals becoming more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolved behaviorally compared to people around us who have not been</i><br>
<i>&gt;associated as we have due to the amount we have steeped ourselves in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology of the internet compared to the average person. Living up</i><br>
<i>&gt;here in the sticks, I find myself day by day becoming less and less able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to relate to the people in my community, as they are less and less able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to comprehend the sort of concepts that you and I take for granted as</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious. As we see more and more technological advancements happening,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or are working on them ourselves, we are becoming less and less human,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and more and more transhuman simply by our concepts, relationships, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that which we see as given rather than mere possibility.</i><br>
<p>
You somewhat misunderstood my point regarding technology.  I was stating<br>
that our *fundamental* behaviors and imperatives haven't changed.  The same<br>
fundamental biological imperatives that drove human behavior 100000 years<br>
ago are driving human behavior today regardless of technology.  These<br>
behaviors happen at such a low level that we normally are not even conscious<br>
of them.  Sure, specific high-level behaviors *do* change, but these are the<br>
programmed, socially induced behaviors.  The DNA level behaviors (animal<br>
behaviors) have not changed.  There is a whole aspect of our behavior that<br>
is totally on autopilot.  <br>
<p>
If you step outside the bulk of humanity and observe them from afar, their<br>
behavior is in most ways indistinguishable from other animals.  These<br>
behaviors are so intrinsic to us that they influence our evolving<br>
"programmable" social behavior to a great extent.  Our learned behaviors are<br>
variations on the basic themes of our DNA-induced behaviors.<br>
<p>
To quote you (Michael Lorrey):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Look at baboon or chimp behavioral psychology. I am convinced that</i><br>
<i>&gt;as we grow from infants to adults we go through behavioral evolutions</i><br>
<i>&gt;symbolic of different stages in our species evolution from primitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;apes, just as our fetal biological evolution is analogous to our</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution from one celled animals up to our present stage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Schoolyard bullies exihibit classic alpha male behaviors, and enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetic purity to the average to prevent possible genetically weak</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals from impinging on the troops gene pool and thereby</i><br>
<i>&gt;threatening its survival."</i><br>
<p>
Since you imply that these reflections of animal behavior are not learned,<br>
then they *must* be the influence of our DNA.  As we get older, our DNA<br>
doesn't change, and neither do our fundamental behaviors.  Go to any bar on<br>
a Saturday night and observe human behavior.  The parallels to animal<br>
behavior are uncanny.  <br>
The most intelligent, educated people exhibit characteristic animal<br>
behaviors, even people who are consciously aware of the parallelism of these<br>
behaviors with animal behaviors.  The only thing that happens as we become<br>
adults is that we learn to mask these behaviors a little better, but their<br>
influence is unmistakeable and unavoidable.<br>
<p>
There are some aspects of our behavior which I believe are virtually<br>
impossible to address or control in a logical, rational manner.<br>
