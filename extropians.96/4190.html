I quite agree with David Musick (if I read him correctly)  that<br>
empathy is the root of morality. So said Schopenhauer long ago (more<br>
or less), and I think it really is as simple as that.  The 'rules'<br>
of morality have no bite whatsoever for someone who feels no empathy<br>
for his or her fellow human beings: nor do they have any<br>
justification unless one feels empathy.  (I mean, if someone has<br>
empathy *then* it is possible to say that such-and-such rules,<br>
generally followed will lead to 'good' benefits for all concerned,<br>
and then the person will say "Aha, so I *should* follow those rules<br>
then!"  He will say this because he *wants* the 'good' benefits for<br>
all concerned, because he feels empathy.) <br>
<p>
Why do libertarians generally feel the need to dress up empathy as somehow selfish?  Surely it is <br>
just what it seems: concern for others, pure and simple.  This is <br>
the more baneful side of Rand's influence at work again.  Ach, so much good she did, <br>
yet how much confusion has flowed from her work also!<br>
<p>
The situation is this: morality *is* concern for others' dignity;<br>
ethics *is* concern for one's own (via integrity): as a matter of<br>
fact most people, most of the time, and when they aren't in<br>
psychological pain, are concerned with their own and others'<br>
dignity, and wish the best for all, including themselves.  I<br>
conjecture that this tendency is partly innate and partly reinforced<br>
and handed down.  <br>
<p>
Why so?  Because as TIT FOR TAT shows, it is objectively the <br>
case that co-operation wins in the end, therefore these traits will <br>
be selected for, both genetically and culturally.<br>
<p>
What's all the fuss about?<br>
