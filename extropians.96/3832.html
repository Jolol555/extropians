<i>&gt;  Firefly Network Inc. has just launched a public beta of our website</i><br>
<i>&gt;recommendation service on My Yahoo! This service is the result of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;partnership between Yahoo! Inc. and Firefly Network, Inc. in application</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Automated Collaborative Filtering (ACF) technology to the Web. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It allows users to find Websites that they are most likely to find of</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest, to find like-minded people, and otherwise help the user navigate</i><br>
<i>&gt;the vast domain of sites and people in an intelligent and personalized way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The recommendation system draws its intelligence from users' ratings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;At this point, the database is still small, so you may not get</i><br>
<i>&gt;recommendations in all categories and the ones you get may not be optimal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, as the system collects more ratings and learns more about your</i><br>
<i>&gt;personal preferences, you will notice better and better performance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your ratings will be included into the initial rating database and will</i><br>
<i>&gt;help shape experience of many people who will come to the system after you,</i><br>
<i>&gt;so please be considerate rating sites.</i><br>
<p>
Aha! I told you loss of privacy is inevitable! Cameras in public places,<br>
search tools based on collective intelligence creating databases of<br>
concentrated information on a user allowing the creation of a highly<br>
accurate psychological profile. This technology is good but we must make a<br>
few sacrifices. I've signed up. Check it out yerself. It'll have news<br>
stories, webpages, ads, etc aimed directly at you eventually and<br>
information will be so much that your looking for and interested in it will<br>
be irresistable to take your eyes off the webpage for fear of missing<br>
something. The ultimate web addiction! I'll love watching it happen! All<br>
they need to do is how to add a plugin or activex program into your browser<br>
so that it will track webpages you view and increase the database info to<br>
allow the searchtool to pull up more interesting information.<br>
