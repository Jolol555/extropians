There an article in _Analog_ a several years ago called "The Long Stern<br>
Chase" (I forget the author) which suggested that the capacity to sweat is a<br>
filter too [pardon the repetition if I wrote about this here before]. It's<br>
reaching, but goes like this: 1) sweating permits the hunting of the type<br>
described in the title. Big cats rely on bursts of high speed to bring down<br>
prey, but human track and chase. Sweating is an important adaptation to that<br>
kind of activity (horse's sweat, but it doesn't seem to be as effective at<br>
cooling them down). 2) Along the way we learned to concentrate on achieving<br>
goals for hours at a time, which is just as important for developing<br>
technology as intelligence and hands.<br>
