<i>&gt;&gt;We Are Libertarians! (Sorry, I just couldn't help it)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Who do you mean by 'we'?</i><br>
<p>
I appears as though the majority of extropians on this list are<br>
libertarians so I generalized.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Without hype, nothing usually ever gets accomplished.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Prove it.</i><br>
<p>
It seems that the masses today are uneducated and mindless and that the<br>
media seems to direct the majority of any progress in any given area by<br>
shining their spotlight on it. There are many weak minds out there which<br>
are easily influenced by the media. We need to educate them the correct<br>
way. If there weren't so many weak minds, you wouldn't have stupid kids<br>
laying in the middle of roads trying to copy movies and getting run over.<br>
Huh, evolution at it's best i guess.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You NEED media hype to stir up action and motivate people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Prove it.</i><br>
<p>
Would you be motivated by a boring speech? People today want drama and action.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;blatant anarchy people always rise to power to lead the masses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Prove it.</i><br>
<p>
Look at certain third world countries where dictatorships rise out of<br>
anarchy. You need to have highly educated masses to have a working anarchy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;There must always be a king of the mountain aka leader in the area of fresh</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;new ideas not necessarily having power but often does acquire it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        If you believe that, why are you on this list?  If you believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt;there must be a leader, then you are inevitably saying that there must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;followers.  One of the underlying pillars of libertarianism is the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-serviam: I Will Not Follow.</i><br>
<p>
When a particular person has a dream and is a good motivator, people follow<br>
it. Ever heard of cooperation? If there was no cooperation how would<br>
ANYTHING get accomplished? I myself like the franchise government idea<br>
meantioned in Snow Crash. I see private industry taking over and running<br>
the gov't on a pay basis and everything inbetween anarchy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I</i><br>
<i>&gt;(and many others) have been seeing on this list lately is a transgression</i><br>
<i>&gt;from extropy to some varied ideas on a cultish 'progress' movement relying</i><br>
<i>&gt;on media and irrational radical conformism.  Not something I would like to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be part of, thanks.  People who have been on the list for years are starting</i><br>
<i>&gt;to leave...and I'm sad to say that I can't blame them.  When I read a post</i><br>
<i>&gt;such as this, the exact words that enter my mind are: "What the Hell are you</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking about?"  The bottom line is that I am not the only one who feels</i><br>
<i>&gt;this way.</i><br>
<p>
You're jumping to conclusions and causing paranoia. It's not that bad. If<br>
you pointed this out everytime you saw it then I would agree but it appears<br>
you were triggered off by solely this post which doesn't give a whole lot<br>
of evidence.<br>
<p>
<p>
"You cannot discover new oceans, unless you have the courage<br>
 to lose sight of the shore"<br>
