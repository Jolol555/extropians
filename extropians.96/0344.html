Apart from the suggested items to bring listed in the invitation, Jerome<br>
reminded me to ask party-goers to bring sleeping bags in case you want to<br>
stay overnight. Last time (three years ago) it looked liked Jonestown,<br>
except that everyone got up again in the morning.<br>
<p>
Jerome expects the party to go from Noon Saturday to Noon Sunday, and<br>
welcomes you to stay overnight, but you will need to bring something to<br>
sleep in/on (or hanging from, whatever works for you...).<br>
<p>
Also, bring CDs of music you think partiers might like. There's the<br>
possibility of a custom-CD collection being made after the party, so if you<br>
have a favorite track that you think should be on the limited-edited<br>
Freeland '96 CD, bring it along.<br>
<p>
A reminder to bring food and drink. It's definitely a pot luck.<br>
<p>
See you there.<br>
