Most people weren't that bad at reliable food sources.  There's two<br>
versions of the "starvation vs. sweatshops" scenario.  One is where<br>
peasants move from successful farms -- e.g. doing as well as they had<br>
been before, obviously not starving or there wouldn't be any people<br>
there -- into the factories because they want the higher wages.  I<br>
ignore socialist arguments there.<br>
<p>
But the other case is where they do have to choose between real<br>
starvation and working, because they've been kicked off their land.<br>
Lots of reasons and causes for that; one of the more egregious is when<br>
the national government, with World Bank/IMF encouragement, builds a<br>
dam.  Lots of people get screwed then, and they don't often get real<br>
benefit from the dam.  [Source Thayer Scudder, Caltech's anthropology<br>
prof and allegedly one of the world experts on the effect of large dams<br>
on native peoples.]  This is hardly a morally clear situation.<br>
<p>
More ambiguous is when the land is still there, but because of Western<br>
medical intervention there are more children, and the land can't feed<br>
them all.<br>
<p>
I'm not advocating socialism, or blanket non-interference, but I would<br>
feel more comfortable if those who seem to be the righteous moral<br>
defenders of capitalism would acknowledge these darkly grey areas.  And<br>
just because it's usually the post-colonial government wielding the<br>
actual guns doesn't convince me that some multinationals wouldn't do so<br>
if they could or had to.  (British East India Company?)<br>

The students Might learn more quickly if they had been left their<br>

did."<br>
