<i>&gt;Suppose I show you 2 people, you talk and get to know them, then I then take </i><br>
<i>&gt;them away and upload them. One I Upload very gradually under conditions you </i><br>

ray <br>
<i>&gt;pulse laser. Now I show you the 2 uploads and let you ask them any question </i><br>
<i>&gt;and perform any test you like. Is there any way you could determine which</i><br>
one <br>

<p>
Unfortunetly the part about sinking into the swamp of metaphysics and<br>
superstition is true. Probably most people will go the way of the gradual<br>
incremental upload due to the fact that people are already thinking about<br>
designing augmentation tools (ie. genetic augmentations for when<br>
genengineering improves, and chips such as British Telecom's vision<br>
recording chip). Also we can pretty-much assume that the tools or knowledge<br>
necessary to detect an individual stream of consciousness will be around<br>
when uploading comes about.<br>
