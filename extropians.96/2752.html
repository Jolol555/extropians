<p>
Aside from the metaphysics, what I was primarily trying to say was that I <br>
didn't see all that much about "the glory of the Powers" in _A Fire Upon <br>
the Deep_.  The only Power we see (other than the Blight, which really <br>
isn't a Power) is Old One.  It cannot descend into the Slow Zone to <br>
activate the Countermeasure, so It has to reconstruct the human Pham to <br>
help.  In short, I found that Vinge was saying alot more about the heroics <br>
of beings at *all* levels than he was about just the Powers.<br>
<p>
Damien:<br>
&lt;The concepts stimulated in my mind, which may or may not be what you had <br>
in mind, is that Vinge's Powers are explicitly somewhat de-mystified.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, somewhat.<br>
<p>
&lt;The Gods don't have strange powers beyond our ken; they're like us, except <br>
much better.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't think they're necessarily 'better', just adapted to their Zones: <br>
bio works at the Bottom, comm nets in the Beyond, and who knows what <br>
substrates they use in the Transcend (see footnotes).<br>
<p>
Damien concludes:<br>
&lt;This is what I _liked_ -- the Powers don't manipulate matter through <br>
direct consciousness; they have tools, like us.  That's why it is harder <br>
SF. And I don't see what Countermeasure is more of a crutch than FTL.  It's <br>
a flexible nano-thingy, which could probably construct jump vanes if <br>
programmed to.  It does something Zonal instead, befitting an object from <br>
the High Transcend.&gt;<br>
<p>
I liked that too - that the Powers don't manipulate matter through direct <br>
consciousness.  BUT, I think the Countermeasure is another matter.<br>
<p>
Pham Nuwen (from the finale):<br>
&lt;I see now, Countermeasure, what it is.... It was designed by something <br>
beyond the Powers.  maybe there are Cloud People, maybe this is signaling <br>
them. [snip] Oh, the ghost of Old One is amused. Seeing beyond the Powers <br>
was almost worth dying for.&gt;<br>

Footnotes:<br>
I also mentioned that I thought Vinge's Zones may also have some 'basis' in <br>
cosmology.  Here are a couple of sticky notes (copied from Science News <br>
articles) that I found when I was glancing back thru my copy of the book:<br>
7/4/92 MOLECULAR GAS IN THE MILKY WAY: "Researchers have detected molecular <br>
gas [clouds of carbon monoxide] at the extreme fringes of the Milky Way <br>
[that] extend along the outskirts ... 100,000 light-years from the galaxy's <br>
center [and] 1,000 light-years above and below our galaxy's thin disk.  The <br>
outlying clouds appear much fainter in carbon monoxide [than those near the <br>
Sun], suggesting they are cold and do not form massive stars."<br>
5/23/92 EXPLORING THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET (hmm, I recall some prose from <br>
somewhere about "explaining ultraviolet to the blind" ;)<br>
"... a type of radiation, rich in information about stellar evolution, that <br>
occupies a highly ellusive part of the electromagnetic spectrum ... such <br>
radiation can't penetrate the patchy, tenuous fog of hydrogen atoms that <br>
fills much of the space between stars."  The point for this discussion <br>
being that this info-rich radiation might more freely flow on the outskirts <br>
of the galaxy.<br>
