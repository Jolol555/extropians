<p>
Thanks for posting it. I think this is a rather illuminating piece of <br>
text, since it shows some of the ideas we have to work against or <br>
circumvent. I hope you can bear me dissecting the text:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	About computers, over which much dispute rages, it suffices</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	to say that they have two fundamental, fatal flaws--quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	apart from the fact that a great deal of pollution and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	sweatshop labor is involved in their manufacture,</i><br>
<p>
How much of computer manufacture is still done in sweatshops? I have the<br>
impression that they being manufactured more and more using automation<br>
(which of course would be seen as promoting unemployment in the third<br>
world). The pollution part is semi-true: it takes resources to make<br>
computers, and they are not all that clean, but if is of course much less<br>
than the resources and pollution needed to make cars. Since these are<br>
somewhat true statements, Sale starts leading the reader down the path of<br>
'yes, that is true, yes, that is true,...' to his desired conclusion. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       some real</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	risks to health and bodily function are connected to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	operation,</i><br>
<p>
Which of course is true for every single device invented - from the <br>
fire and millstone to the Internet. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       considerable deskilling and job displacement result</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	from their corporate use,</i><br>
<p>
This is a very important argument, because it both seem obvious, is hard <br>
to respond quickly to and gets at an emotional nerve - unemployment, <br>
deskilling and displacement feel BAD. I have no intentions of arguing if <br>
it is true or not, but it is easy to state as true. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       and increasing surveillance and </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	invasion of privacy attend their proliferation.  </i><br>
<p>
This is another "obvious" argument, which doesn't have to be true <br>
(Cypherpunks are snickering and sharpening their PGP toolkits). <br>
<p>
This initial diatribe is a good rethorical move. It almost dissmissively <br>
mentions a lot of drawbacks that are easy to accept, and quickly moves <br>
the reader to the two points he is really making, having established some <br>
"truths" and made them hard to respond to by not dwelling on them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       First, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	hands of the large centralizing corporations and bureaucracies</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	that devised and perfected them in the first place, and in </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	service to the goals of production, profitability and power,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	computers are steering the world toward social inequity and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	disintegration and toward environmental instability and collapse,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	and doing so with more speed and efficiency with every passing </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	year--regardless of how many people on the Internet believe they</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	are saving the planet.</i><br>
<p>
Yet again the same technique of semi-truths and half-lies quickly moving<br>
the reader along. He completely ignores/misrepresents who really designed<br>
the computers people use (or more importantly, who designed the *way* they<br>
are used) and why they were developed - the IBM PC was developed to make a<br>
profit, but *how* was uncertain even for Big Blue, computers just sold. <br>
<p>
His view is surprisingly similar to some alarmist books about the computer<br>
revolution written in Sweden in the late 70's, and seem to see computers<br>
more as big mainframes than distributed networks (Kevin Kelly would say he<br>
is thinking in terms of industrial society, where control is paramount,<br>
rather than in terms of network society, where communication is central). <br>
Centralized control by computer seems to be much harder to do today than<br>
previously, although big organizations still can do a lot of things using<br>
networks. <br>
<p>
The section about 'steering the world' is rather unsupported, and seems <br>
to imply that it is the computers' fault, rather than the people who use <br>
them. Still, he has a point: as things move faster, things can change for <br>
good or bad much faster, so they might become more unstable. But that is <br>
a system problem, not just due to computers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Second, computers interpose and mediate</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	between the human and natural world more completely than any </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	other technology--they are uniquely capable of reproducing </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	another nature through biotechnology and many virtual ones--and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	are the instruments that primarily energize the technosphere</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	that not merely distances this civilization from nature but sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	it at war with nature for its daily sustenance.</i><br>
<p>
This is IMHO the rethorical core of his argument, and it is interesting. <br>
The first part is essentially about values: do we want to live in the <br>
natural world or in the technological (cultural) world? He sees the <br>
choice as obvious, and I suppose many of his readers do too, because <br>
nature has become a very positive word today.<br>
<p>
My friend Henrik said: "The goal is to leave nature behind, so we can walk<br>
in it and find it pleasant". If you have to toil to farm the earth most of<br>
the time, or live in constant fear of pestillence and starvation, you will<br>
not have the luxury or even inclination to see it as beautiful, vibrant<br>
and worth preserving as it is. <br>
<p>
The part about the technosphere at war with the biosphere is plain wrong; <br>
so far neither sphere needs much of the resources the other needs (the<br>
exception is humans, we need material for the biosphere). The reason the<br>
technosphere damages the biosphere is more a question of it getting in the<br>
way or being incompatible with the more dynamic technosphere. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Next to that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	is quite insignificant whether some individuals find that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	values of a technological society--speed, ease, mass information,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	mass access, and the like--are served and enhanced by such </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	machines.</i><br>
<p>
This is IMHO the most dangerous part of this text, in a subtle way. He has<br>
presented his case that computers are bad in many ways (and made a<br>
convincing case to many readers), and now he dismisses anybody positive to<br>
computers (and technological society). This creates a "Us vs. Them"  meme,<br>
where the reader is placed on the side of the ecological angels.  The<br>
environment is so important for all of us that any (misguided or selfish)<br>
opposition must be ignored so that the World Can Be Saved. This promotes <br>
a dangerous collectivism that unfortunately is easy to spread among <br>
environmentally conscious people.<br>
<p>
To sum up, I think we need to understand the reasons people oppose us, <br>
think about them and the facts (not all opponents are wrong, after all), <br>
and develop useful counter-memes or research better counter-facts. <br>
