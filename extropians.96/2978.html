<i>&gt; Capitalism encourages people to be unethical. The most unethical can be </i><br>
<i>&gt; the most profitable, althought this is not always the case, it happens </i><br>
<i>&gt; way too frequently. The amount of environmental damage one person </i><br>
<i>&gt; can do when he doesn't have total control over a large organization is &gt;far less. </i><br>
<i>&gt; On his own he could pollute a small piece of land, as the </i><br>
<i>&gt; businessman he can destroy an entire ecosystem. Capitalism gives power to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the unethical so they can do more damage. </i><br>
<p>
I have to disagree here.  I think that if there were many individuals <br>
with their own plants, it would be unrealistic to think that none of<br>
them would try anything "unethical" to further their own career.  Let's<br>
say only one person tried to get away with dumping waste illegally.  The<br>
opposing businesses have two options:  they can team together and use<br>
their clout to have this man punished, or they might recognize the<br>
profits to made by following suit and use their collective guilt to<br>
hopefully avoid punishment (on a freeway filled with speeding cars, what<br>
are the chances that you of all people will be the one who gets pulled<br>
over?)  In other examples you might be able to pull off the old<br>
"righteousness of the little man" argument, but in this case the people<br>
doing the dumping will have to suffer along with the rest of humanity. <br>
The fact that they do it anyway is indicative of the fact that most<br>
people, whether small-time entrepreneurs or faceless heads of monolithic<br>
corporations, don't see toxic waste dumping as a matter of ethics.  The<br>
promise of easy money makes them rationalize the dumping on the grounds<br>
that either it's really not that big a problem or else it's a problem<br>
that can easily be taken care of with someone else's time and money.<br>
