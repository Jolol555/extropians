Davin: &lt;&lt; &gt; There is nothing more selfish or greedy than a government who<br>
spends probably<br>
<i> &gt; 100%+ of my tax dollars on interest payments (I call it the "blackhole").</i><br>
 <br>
 Suresh's Reply:&gt; <br>
 Interest payments on debts taken out for (under Reagan) arms<br>
 manufacturing,&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Have you forgotten the LBJ years and all the years of welfare?   <br>
<p>
Suresh: &lt;&lt; which gives businesses more lucrative contracts than they<br>
 could possibly get from consumer items. More money goes towards corporate<br>
 subsidies than  welfare.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Lucrative to you,  negotiated contracts to me.  Welfare to you, business to<br>
me.  <br>
<p>
That's not welfare, that's business (and jobs).  Don't blame the companies<br>
for getting business.    They had a product the government wanted and got<br>
paid for it.  <br>
<p>
Do you want them to say no to the business? ... To give their products away<br>
for free?  Or, should they say "You negotiated poorly, we feel sorry for you<br>
big government, here's a refund"?  Would you give a refund?<br>
<p>
My problem is that the government couldn't afford it and raised my taxes so I<br>
had to pay for something I might not have wanted (except for my job of<br>
course).<br>
<p>
These will be my last public e-mails on this subject.  I think the mailing<br>
list for Extropian thought is inappropriate for my further comments.  I will<br>
use private e-mail.  Thank you.<br>
