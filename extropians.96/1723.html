<p>
Why not? One of the things corporations compete for is workers. If the working<br>
conditions are bad I might move to another company even if they pay less,<br>
provided they had pleasant working conditions. A company can not exist without <br>
people, it's in their best interest to make workers as happy as they can or <br>
they will leave and join a competitor.<br>

<i>                &gt;big corporation may not.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why couldn't you compete? If you have wonderful working conditions and pay <br>
huge wages then nobody will want to work for your competition, the big <br>
corporation, and they will go out of business, unless.... Unless the <br>
astronomical wages makes the product you sell so expensive that nobody wants <br>
to buy it, and then you would have no money to pay anybody anything. Silly me, <br>
I just answered my own question, please ignore.<br>

<i>                &gt;1400$ per person in corporate subsidy, 400 dollars per </i><br>
<i>                &gt;person for welfare per year in tax dollars. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I haven't checked your figures but I have a hunch much of that is in the form<br>
of tax breaks, if companies do certain things the government agrees not to<br>
steal as much from them. If I decide not to stick a gun in your face today and<br>
rob you of 50$, does that mean I've subsidized you? Should you thank me?<br>
<p>
Having said that, I have no doubt the government does play favorites with<br>
companies, by crushing competitors with force in the name of anti trust laws,<br>
I'm also sure part of that 1400$ figure of yours is indeed a subsidy. I don't<br>
think anyone or anything should be subsidized by tax dollars because I don't<br>
think their should be any tax dollars.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The fact that we need politicians, who pretty much have the </i><br>

<i>                &gt;capitalist democracy system is.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I repeat my question because I don't consider that a satisfactory reply. In a<br>
democracy, if I am unwilling to voluntarily give money to poor people why <br>
would I vote for a politician who would force me to do it through taxes? <br>
In a dictatorship, why would angering the most powerful people in society and <br>
becoming a friend of those least able to help the dictator stay in power be a <br>
wise move for him to make?<br>

<p>
<p>
And the only way to abolish private property is by force. If you want to <br>
live on a socialist commune that has no private property I have not the<br>
slightest objection, and I wish you the best of luck, you'll need it. I do<br>
have one very important question however, how do you intend to deal with<br>
people like me who don't want to join your workers paradise and just <br>
want to be left alone? Will you try to convince me to join by your splendid <br>
example, by showing me how fabulously prosperous your community is and how <br>
educated and happy the people are, OR, can I expect a knock on my door at 3am <br>
from people wearing uniforms?<br>

<p>
<i>                &gt;Most crime comes from poverty, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And History has shown that the best way to get rid of poverty is to get rid<br>
of private property, that's why the former Soviet Union is the economic<br>
powerhouse it is today, that's also why it's a crime free paradise with the <br>
workers having not a worry in the world.<br>
                          <br>
<p>

I'm irate too, the statement is not true, Clinton has not been good for<br>

<i>                &gt;I really don't see that. Explain.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In Anarcho- Capitalism, there would still be police and there would still be<br>
law, but it would be private police and private law. PPL's (privately produced<br>
law) in a anarchic world would have private protection agencies (PPA's) to<br>
back them up. Disputes among PPA's would be settled by an independent<br>
arbitrator agreed to by both parties BEFORE the disagreement happened.<br>
Something like that can happen today. When companies sign complicated<br>
contracts they sometimes also agree on who will arbitrate it if differences <br>
in interpretation happen. Nobody want to get caught up in the slow, expensive<br>
court system run by governments. The arbitrator would be paid by the case,<br>
and because he is picked by both sides, it's in his interest to be as just as<br>
possible. If he favored one side over another or made brutal or stupid<br>
decisions he would not be picked again and would need to look for a new line<br>
of work. Unlike present day judges and juries, justice would have a positive<br>
survival value for the arbitrator. <br>
                      <br>
All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing <br>
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence <br>
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in <br>
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect<br>
the total level of violence to be less than what we have now, but I'm not <br>
such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. Even when force is not <br>
used the implicit threat is always there, another good reason to be civilized.<br>
                      <br>
I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a  rich man's <br>
PPA makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on my <br>
mother being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's going to need <br>
one hell of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is <br>
expensive because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages <br>
it will need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for <br>
all this they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely <br>
limiting their customer base and that means even higher charges. They could<br>
never get the upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to <br>
outspend a PPA that had  outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. <br>
A yacht cost a lot more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer <br>
than all the yacht builders on the planet combined. <br>
                      <br>
No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the <br>
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one <br>
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans <br>
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things<br>
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,  <br>
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy , even theoretically .    <br>
                      <br>
In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to <br>
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews  would be willing to pay as <br>
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be <br>
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%. <br>
As a result the PPA protecting Jews  would be much stronger than the one that <br>
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you <br>
( like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man <br>
one vote.   <br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt; you can have too much liberty.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Well, unfortunately the world is structured in such a way that it's physically<br>
impossible for everybody to have an infinite amount of liberty, it's probably<br>
impossible to have an infinite amount of any virtue, but that doesn't mean it<br>
has a limit, you can and should always strive for more. Equality on the other<br>
hand has a limit, enough is enough.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Operating a mill  better tends to mean "how much wages can I</i><br>
<i>                &gt;take away without reducing the  output of my workers.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, but if I make my workers unhappy enough it will reduce their output to<br>
zero because they'll quit. <br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;it is in the corporations interest to consolidate affluence</i><br>
<i>                &gt;so that  it has no need to tailor it's product to different</i><br>
<i>                &gt;cultures.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The bankruptcy courts are littered with the carcasses of corporations that<br>
ignored cultural differences and tried to get their customers to conform to<br>
the companies wishes rather than the reverse. In general I can't imagine a<br>
better or faster way to go broke.<br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;dump the Government not the business.</i><br>

If joining your "Anarcho-syndicalism" is voluntary then it's a business, if<br>
it's not voluntary then it's a Government, if it's neither then it's nothing.<br>

<i>                &gt;business people have pretty much the  same power as a</i><br>
<i>                &gt;politician.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No they do not. If I don't like what a company is selling I don't have to<br>
buy it, it makes no difference if I like what government is selling or not,<br>
I must buy it or people will come to my house and drag me away.<br>
Everybody agrees that force is justified in self defense, but government <br>
claims far more rights than that, more than any sane individual or <br>
corporation would dream of. If government needs money they take it, if I <br>
object to them stealing my property they will use force to get their way, <br>
as much force as they need to, up to and including a bullet in my brain. <br>
They will NOT take "no" for an answer. I don't think Government should not<br>
have more rights than individuals, but then of course, then they wouldn't<br>
be governments.       <br>

<i>                &gt;dictate prices to me</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I could only do that if there are about a million people with talents equal to<br>
or greater than yours who are currently making 0 cents an hour and would love<br>
to have your job. You like equality so tell me, why do you deserve the job<br>
more than they do, especially when you don't even like it?<br>

<i>                &gt;Human labour has been  commodified, so all we do is sell it</i><br>
<i>                &gt;to others.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not so, some labor we do for love, as when we take care of our children.<br>
There are only 3 ways to get somebody to do something you want, love, trade,<br>
or force. I like to encourage the first two and keep force to a minimum.<br>

<i>                &gt;born addicted to crack.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, and a kid lucky enough to be born with genes that gave him a boiling<br>
water IQ has an advantage over a kid who's dumb as dirt.<br>
                      <br>

<i>                &gt;I don't want it [ a peoples network] subsidized, I would</i><br>
<i>                &gt;like to see it come out of peoples homes.</i><br>
<p>
           <br>
That's not a subsidy? You would be using force to make companies spend<br>
billions of dollars to pipe this drivel into everybody's house and waste<br>
valuable bandwidth that most people would rather put to a different use.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I would like to see decentralized media.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
How much force are you going to use to get it? You will also need a<br>
centralized power to decide when it is "decentralized" enough. Who is in<br>
charge of this centralized power? Can I have the job? I promise that my only<br>
interest will be in serving the public. Really. I would never lie to you to<br>
you, my dear friends. I feel your pain.<br>
<p>
If you believe that, I have some swamp land with oil on it that I'd like to <br>
sell you.                    <br>

<i>                &gt;Really, and how much does a computer cost</i><br>
<p>
Well, I think you could probably pick up an old 286 with a 2400 baud modem<br>
at a garage sale for 100$ or so. You may not think that's much of a machine<br>
but just a few years ago it was hot stuff, it's certainly powerful enough<br>
to expose the world to your ideas. If nobody is interested in your words you<br>
can't blame the computer.<br>
