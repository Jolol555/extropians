I received the following from C. David Eagle &lt;eagle@earth.com&gt;<br>
My feeling is that this Guild, if it flies, will look somewhat<br>
different from what is charted below - but in any case, I think<br>
you may sympathize with many of these suggestions - and maybe<br>
will be interested in working on them.<br>

<p>
  I am forming a group named the "Libertarian Programmers' Guild".<br>
The goals are as follows:<br>
<p>
<p>
1.  Make money.<br>
<p>
<p>
2.  Make money, based on the value of one's production.<br>
<p>
<p>
3.  Specifically, reward programmers with royalties based on the<br>
    subjectively rated difficulty of their software effort and the<br>
    frequency of sales of their code.<br>
<p>
<p>
4.  Promote the use of shared libraries between ALL applications<br>
    running on a system:<br>
<p>
<p>
    a) by eliminating the legal &amp; economic barriers to calling someone<br>
       else's subroutines.<br>
    b) so that total installed software size on a system running our<br>
       software can be *DRAMATICALLY* reduced.<br>
    c) while creating competitive incentives to programmers to improve<br>
       the efficiency of library subroutines.<br>
<p>
<p>
5.  Create a state-of-the-art development environment.<br>
<p>
<p>
6.  Create a state-of-the-art distribution system.<br>
<p>
<p>
7.  Harness the power of the latent software development energy on the<br>
    net (a la Linux).<br>
<p>
<p>
8.  Further libertarian goals, which might include:<br>
<p>
<p>
    a. Provide an individual computer owner independence from any large<br>
       corporation or government entity.  As a minimum, I believe this<br>
       requires that the owner of a computer at least have the option<br>
       of holding/touching/reading *ALL* the source code for *ALL* the<br>
       software running on his/her system.<br>
<p>
<p>
    b. Provide a built-in security system which<br>
<p>
<p>
       i) is extremely easy to use, being mostly transparent.<br>
       ii) is extremely powerful, potentially supporting the full matrix<br>
           of capabilities-oriented security (2-dimensional security<br>
           system; one axis is 'agents' (programs/users) and the other<br>
           axis is 'resources' (files/devices/agents))<br>
       iii) is integrated with the low-level disk access agents resulting<br>
            in a seamless and highly efficient system<br>
<p>
<p>
    c. Implementing applications which rely upon high security, such<br>
       as digital cash and electronic marketplaces.<br>
<p>
<p>
    d. Produce software to specifically assist libertarian organizations.<br>
       Many possibilities here.<br>
<p>
<p>
    e. Implement applications, such as waldos (remote-controlled manufacturing,<br>
       manipulation, etc.), which break the geographic connection between<br>
       living and working (and, presumably, reduce the ability of<br>
       territorial countries to assign tax-collecting authority).<br>
<p>
<p>
9.  Enable libertarian programmers to participate to as small or large<br>
    an extent as they desire, rewarding them with royalties for as little<br>
    as a single subroutine submitted.<br>
<p>
<p>
10.  Address and solve many of the annoying issues related to today's<br>
     commercial software.  Among these are name conflicts, un-installation<br>
     difficulties, mysterious files, and legacy carryovers.<br>
<p>
<p>
11.  I must also confess to at least one ulterior motive behind several of<br>
     my proposals.  There is a reason I want to see a small, fast,<br>
communication-<br>
     oriented OS.  I am interested in nanotechnology.  There is at least<br>
     one pressing future application which requires such an OS; that is,<br>
     a nanite.  Ribosomes, our best model in nature, have about a million<br>
     atoms, which translates (roughly) into a computing environment about<br>
     as powerful as a Commodore 64.<br>
<p>
<p>
12.  Give the software away.<br>
<p>
<p>
13.  Give away all the software that runs on any user's system.<br>
<p>
<p>
14.  Copyright, but make freely distributable, all the software which is<br>
     intended to run on users' systems.<br>
<p>
<p>
15.  Make money by<br>
<p>
<p>
     a. Asking for voluntary support a la shareware.<br>
<p>
<p>
     b. Selling optimized, customized installations which perform better<br>
        and more to a person/company's liking.  Such custom installations<br>
        would take up far less disk space because they would not include<br>
        software the user was not willing to pay the programmers' royalty<br>
        for (probably because they have little or no use for that program).<br>
        The custom installation would be automatically built by closely-<br>
        held software back at our headquarters.<br>
<p>
<p>
     c. Selling support and training services.<br>
<p>
<p>
     d. Selling the output of closely held software, rather than the<br>
        software itself.  For example, say we wrote a program which<br>
        did a good job of predicting the weather.  Then, keeping the<br>
        software secure behind our walls and never letting a single<br>
        copy out, we could sell weather predictions.<br>
<p>
<p>
     e. Selling timely, guaranteed safe upgrades to our software.  In<br>
        this way, the customer could, for example, be transparently<br>
        downloaded new and improved versions of the software s/he<br>
        has already purchased a custom installation of.  Ideally,<br>
        over time the software would grow smaller and smaller, run<br>
        faster and faster, be easier and easier to use, be more and<br>
        more bug-free, and be more and more powerful.<br>
<p>
<p>

  I am C. David Eagle.  My resume is available upon request if you want<br>
to know my technical qualifications.  I need lots of help to get this<br>
set up, but the potential rewards are enormous.  For instance, I could<br>
use some help right now enhancing the web page<br>
<a href="http://members.aol.com/mingovia/david/guild.html">http://members.aol.com/mingovia/david/guild.html</a><br>
and I could use some help setting up a mailing list.  If you are at all<br>
interested, please email me at eagle@earth.com.<br>
