<i>&gt;Hmm, I failed to notice a dramatic increase in the use of robots just </i><br>
<i>&gt;lately. Manual labor has still a fair niche. Only large hardware ANNs </i><br>
<i>&gt;will change this situation, and these are unlikely to appear too soon.</i><br>
I have too failed to notice a dramatic increase in the use of robots.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; at many brainless tasks, and better machines will(be able) to out perform </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; them in the remaining drudgeries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You know, most people don't like being unemployed. Trivial things like </i><br>
<i>&gt;housing, food, clothing, and such. They might get pissed sufficiently to </i><br>
<i>&gt;start an insurrection.</i><br>
Jobs will need to be eventually of the information &amp; research type ONLY, due<br>
to the lack of grunt labor jobs. This will probably be one of the steps in<br>
the years pre uploading when jobs will move from grunt labor type to<br>
information &amp; research type. The people with the brains will survive and<br>
people who don't have the brains to keep up will end up homeless<br>
unfortunetly. Unfortunetly many people won't have the brains to survive the<br>
21st century. You will see alot of people getting REALLY smart REALLY fast<br>
in order to survive in a world where if you don't know all the little<br>
technical details someone will screw you over.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; A big question is how much will it cost to maintain a drone work force.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm sure that genetic engineers could make more efficient organisms than </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; those currently available, but they'll still need food and waste </i><br>
<i>&gt;I know a bit about DNA tinkering, and I think this damn unlikely.</i><br>
Why? Combination bio &amp; tech could enable many more elements into the genetic<br>
mix allowing many new and different combinations and structures to be built.<br>
What if we could build silicon or flourine-based lifeforms?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; removal.  Who will provide the mindless service of feeding and clean up </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; after the drones-- machines, humans, or more drones?</i><br>
<i>&gt;If they are sufficiently smart to operate the machinery, they sure are </i><br>
<i>&gt;smart enough to feed themselves.</i><br>
True<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Moral Question: How is bulding an race of drones in a laboratory for </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; labor different from just building designer humans to perform those same </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; tasks?  Would these humans be created or enslaved?</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is pure slavery, of course. Tinkering with human DNA to produce a </i><br>
<i>&gt;race of slaves is immoral as hell, imo.</i><br>
Why? They'd just be mindless animals running only on preprogrammed<br>
pleasure-driven instincts to do their desired task.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Currently, _any_ tinkering with </i><br>
<i>&gt;human DNA is a strong no no since the yield is so low. Site directed </i><br>
<i>&gt;mutagenesis or DNA snipping/insertion is easy on bacteria where you </i><br>
<i>&gt;select automagically e.g. by ampicillin resistancy, but just try this on </i><br>
<i>&gt;human embryos. 99.999 % nonviable. Hoo, boy.</i><br>
So far they have been able to nearly cure hemophillia and that "bubble boy"<br>
syndrome. One kid was a hemophilliac and the other had that syndrome. So<br>
they infected them as a fetus and allowed the virus to spread through their<br>
system, replacing a single gene in each cell.<br>
