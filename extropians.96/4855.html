<p>
People's votes matter about as much as their economic decisions, as both<br>
producers and consumers. The scale is, I agree, "microscopic" - relative<br>
to the society, but it is exactly the size of that one person.  The<br>
"microscopic" feedback would be of the same size too - enough to motivate<br>
this person to be responsible, which could bring the same effectiveness<br>
and innovation levels into the political process that these factors have<br>
been putting into the economic organism.<br>

Smart people are often outsiders *because they are smart*.  Even if they<br>
direct all their smarts at the problems that make other people<br>
miserable.  Kids want to hang out with other kids who are cute, rich,<br>
can play music, dance or get drugs, but not those environmentally concerned.<br>
I have seen a lot of resentment of scientists and philosophers, and attempts<br>
to discuss any serious topics in conversations.  It's almost non-PC to<br>
raise serious theoretical points of any kind at a general social gathering.<br>
The fear and hatred of intelligent people are also in the interest of the<br>
social powers - and on a number of [totalitarian] occasions, they have been<br>
spread to most of the populace - and led to repressions and even extermination<br>
of a sizeable part of intelligentsia.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If scientists became millionaires, it might be a different story. </i><br>
<p>
People have a lot more non-resentful curiosity to lives, opinions and<br>
relationships of millionaires, royal/political figures, even criminals<br>
- than any scientists.  It's very, very well known.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 'Here is where the red man and the white man both know nothing.'"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The circle always widens, but nobody is in a position to boast.</i><br>
<p>
 Comparisons are relative - so what?  Better opinions, and better<br>
products are not the best possible - nobody claims that! - but they<br>
are better nevertheless.  Giving greater weight to [OK, relatively]<br>
better things is at the foundation of all progress.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  look at the amount of heat generated over abortions.</i><br>
<p>
Little light though.  Lots of mud-slinging and references to the Bible<br>
and other equally argumentative sources.  Attempts of putting some<br>
philosophical foundations under the debate (see mine at<br>
&lt;"<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/Abortions.txt">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/Abortions.txt</a>"&gt; ) find little<br>
interest on any of the sides.<br>

<i>&gt;  My ethical system prohibits division]; all</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious beings are ethically symmetrical.  But if I did divide the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world into two parts, anyone ignorant enough to do the same wind up on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wrong side.</i><br>
<p>
I divide things into women and men, plants and animals, children and<br>
adults, people with e-mail access and without it, and draw all kinds<br>
of other - not necessarily binary or strict - distinctions. In my<br>
understanding, these distinctions form the foundation of my ontology.<br>
I do not see any point in "symmetry" either. Is Hitler as ethical as<br>
his victims?  Can anybody ever make progress in ethics? Then people<br>
do get better at it?  Then they can be different, right?<br>
Or what do you mean here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And, finally, I deny your abstraction.  Each human represents a hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt;billion neurons, a hundred trillion synapses, carrying twenty</i><br>
<i>&gt;quadrillion pulses per second, forged by three million years of</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious evolution and a billion years behind that.  Stupid?  In AI,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we've learned respect for human intelligence the hard way.  The "masses"</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be stupid; the individuals, never.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, people have better bodies and brains than flat worms.  Still, some<br>
of them are MUCH better or worse than others in many [groups of] tasks,<br>
from running to painting to math, based on both genetic factors and<br>
upbringing.  This is a FACT of life.  A good social structure should<br>
help people develop and utilize their skills and help relate them to<br>
each other.  This will all be true even when all numbers you cite<br>
increase by orders of magnitude.<br>
<p>
Are you saying that your opinion on this subject is better than mine,<br>
or they are equally valuable/valid?  What about all other opinions held<br>
on this subject?  Like, "all people who do not like KGB are evil and<br>
stupid, and should be killed"? I did hear it as an individual opinion...<br>

<p>
On schools and such:<br>
<p>
The amount of knowledge available to the American populace, and the<br>
ability to explore the world by reading, browsing or travel, is enormously<br>
greater than what was available to all great thinkers of the past.<br>
The genes are about the same.  The social memetic soup is different,<br>
and so are media channels, and as a result the society provides different<br>
amounts and structures of motivations.  This is what determines the<br>
level of interests of individual ensembles of genes and memes - a.k.a. <br>
"people".  The idea "do not blame the results [people], blame the<br>
reasons [society]", seems of the same origin as the opposite idea<br>
usually used in education: " do not criticize a person, criticize the<br>
results of hir work" - they are both designed as instruments to<br>
improve people's behavior while putting the negative assessments<br>
elsewhere so that not to offend the humans you are trying to influence<br>
- and this is understandable, taking into account that humans are the<br>
only parts of the picture that can feel offended, and they are also the<br>
ones designing the memes.  This all doesn't mean these things are true<br>
though.<br>
