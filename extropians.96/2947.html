IAN: When I post to a public list, in reply to a given person, by<br>
doing so, I inherently invite any member to respond to my post.<br>
<p>
<p>

<i> &gt;Since you previously accused me of using ad hominem arguments, I think it</i><br>
<i> &gt;is fair for me to point out that you are now resorting to "straw man"</i><br>
<i> &gt;tactics.  I have never advocated "more government."  In fact, my advocacy</i><br>
<i> &gt;of significantly less government is documented in two books and dozens of</i><br>
<i> &gt;articles.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: I'm using examples, analogy, to try to explain what it seems <br>
"optimism" has to do with the inquiry into who shotdown TWA 800,<br>
which was necessitated to the degree it was unclear why you <br>
inserted the word into the debate.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;It seems to be a universal tactic all over the internet that those who</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;want to pooh-pooh the Navy TWA 800 theory are actually assuming to score</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;points against the theory by suggesting that those who broach the theory</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;are saying "here's what really happened." Yet in fact I've yet to see</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;someone, with perhaps the exception of Salinger, say that.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Nonsense.  The message "forwarded by Peter James" and posted to this forum</i><br>
<i> &gt; stated "TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE."  When I</i><br>
<i> &gt; expressed skepticism about this statement, you accused me of denying that</i><br>
<i> &gt; TWA Flight 800 could have been downed by a *missile*, which is also not</i><br>
<i> &gt; what I said.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Well, yes, "the internet document" is the one case, and Salinger<br>
to a strong degree -- but it was anonymous. Your right, I previously<br>
erred in my suggestion that you discounted the missile theory, and<br>
I acknowledged my error and said I was sorry weeks ago. I hope <br>
there's no hard feelings.<br>
