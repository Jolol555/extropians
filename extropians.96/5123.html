I had said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Anyway, what I'm saying is that the real work of AI is the work being</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; done</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; by more "mundane" programmers: organizing knowledge in better, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; compatible, computer-manipulable ways.  So, much of software development</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is leading to AI, or the singularity, whichever comes first, but it's all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the same process.</i><br>

<i>&gt;Thats right but i believe it should be more focused against empovering the</i><br>
<i>&gt;end-user. The whole idea of system development is a bummer. It should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible for the end-user to develop their own systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course it's not easy and it can't be done today ot tomorrow, but if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;focus on that as the end-goal, then it should happen sometime.</i><br>
<p>
A belated amen.  Making things that are clear for humans (and maybe happen<br>
to have application to AI) is better than making techniques for AI that<br>
don't help clarify anything for regular people.  Even if they're technically<br>
equivalent, the emphasis on clarity and user accessibility is important.<br>
It's just that human-useable computer techniques are probably AI-useable<br>
too.<br>
<p>
Also I share the intuition that programmability by end-users and visual<br>
programming are important.  It seems to me that programs to deal with a<br>
subject matter should be created by people into that subject, and in<br>
a style that makes sense to those people, not by programmers in C++.<br>
Having so many programmers (I'm a programmer by trade btw) seems like<br>
having a society ruled by plumbers or lawyers--there's just something<br>
*wrong* with it.<br>
<p>
I think part of the problem is that since programmers *can* write programs<br>
in C++, the idea of making higher-level systems seems self-indulgent.<br>
Managers don't like the idea of programming as a quest, a project for the<br>
empowerment, uplift, transcendence even, of humanity.  And programmers like<br>
me are nerds, of course, willing to follow orders if it means we get to<br>
engage our nerdly skills.  You know, "What was I thinking, uplift, hah...<br>
I should get back to work..."<br>
