<i>&gt;Is this all there is to the mailing list?</i><br>
No, it can be *very* good. I've only recently rejoined the list<br>
(I used to be here as bob_g@eris.demon.co.uk), and it does seem<br>
to have wandered a bit far off-topic at the moment. I think some<br>
of the prime movers are a bit busy on other projects at the moment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There have been some good threads in the digest though.</i><br>
I'm sure it will get back to that form soon. I suppose it's up to<br>
us members to keep it on track. Anyone here read<br>
Matt Ridley's "The Origin of Virtue" yet?<br>
It's about the evolution of cooperation despite it's apparent<br>
contradictions with the 'selfish gene' worldview.<br>
While it covers evolution in general, it homes in on Human 'society'<br>
in particular, and has much to say on our particular kinds of<br>
cooperation and 'selfishenss'. I've only read about 1/3 so far, but<br>
it certainly touches on quite a few Extropian subjects, IMO.<br>
