	Truth would be relative in such cases.<br>
	Two seemingly contradictory events occuring at the exact same time,<br>
	and at the same place are only contradictory from the observers<br>
	current point of view.  Such observerations would put someone<br>
	at a cusp of new a understanding.  A new point of view.  Or the<br>
	above mentioned observer could simply ignore it and move on, which<br>
	in my opinion is more likely to happen.<br>
<p>
	Example:<br>
		It is raining while the sun is shining.  There after, <br>
	the observer could decide that it does not necessarly have to<br>
	be completly overcast for it to rain .. and the observer turing <br>
	away from the sunshine may just discover a rainbow.<br>
