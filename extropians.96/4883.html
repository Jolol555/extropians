<i>&gt; I'm afraid Michael Lorrey has read far more into my parenthesis</i><br>

<i>&gt; put up a follow-up post dealing with just that, but hey, I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to get kicked out of the NRA. (Actually, I quit the NRA, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; only because they insist on supporting the Republican Party.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My sin was not in going unarmed but in failing to pay adequate</i><br>
<i>&gt; attention to my immediate environment.  What can I say, it had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; a long day and I was tired and not in a good frame of mind to resist</i><br>
<i>&gt; the temptation to get lost in thought about whatever I was daydreaming</i><br>
<i>&gt; about at the time. I was surprised from behind, quietly.  Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; if I took some more ninjutsu classes, I'd learn an effective defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; against this maneuver, but the defense that I did come up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; (running away as fast as I could while screaming at the top of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; lungs) worked in that particular situation, so I was lucky. However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; drawing down on the fellow after he had rested his barrel on my</i><br>
<i>&gt; temple would have been suicidal--far more so than what I actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; did. I recognized the pistol by feel, because it felt exactly like</i><br>
<i>&gt; my own Glock 19.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The sad thing is that after I reached back to remove the miscreant's</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand from my collar, discovered his automatic pistol (with my hand),</i><br>
<i>&gt; and made my instant decision, I didn't even give the rascal any time</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ask for my wallet. As a result, the only thing they could write down</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the police report describing the offense was "brandishing firearm".</i><br>
<i>&gt; Something to think about the next time you research police crime stats.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And I certainly hope you didn't mean to tar me with that "pro individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom yet anti RKBA" brush. When I was going on about the evils of</i><br>
<i>&gt; flying lead pellets, I was under no delusion that "gun control" laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; are of any use in minimizing such evils. My own opinion is that decent</i><br>
<i>&gt; human beings are in no short supply, and that the more of them are</i><br>
<i>&gt; well armed, the less trouble we can expect from those human beings</i><br>
<i>&gt; who fall well below the minimum standards of decency.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Thank you for that clarification. It would be stupid of me to second<br>
guess what was obviously a panic laden situation. here's a tip though:<br>
if someone is so desperate as to need to rob you at gunpoint, it is<br>
highly likely they could not afford to buy bullets for the gun. many<br>
armed theives have been found with EMPTY weapons. of course its a gamble<br>
that I would expect only a proud person to take. As Lazarus Long<br>
said:"If it came to a choice between being a dead lion or a live jackal,<br>
I would obviously prefer to be a live lion, but I'm outside the rules<br>
anyway."<br>
