Yes, that's what he was arguing, and the "why?" is precisely because<br>
it demonstrates reactions like yours, and shows how emotional reactions<br>
can cloud our minds.  Questioning the motives of the proponent is a<br>
classic fallacy of reason, as is following "common knowledge".  I don't<br>
happen to know whether or not gas chambers were used at Auschwitz--I<br>
don't think it matters.  Given the scale of the other atrocities, I<br>
think that it's a minor point.  What's the difference morally between<br>
a gas chamber and a crematorium?  But I think it is interesting to see<br>
how attached some people are to that point, and how rigorously they<br>
defend it with non-reason.  Perhaps a rational treatment of that<br>
question, as proposed, would indeed be a valuable document on reason.<br>
