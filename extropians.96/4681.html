<i>&gt; Here are some observations and ideas I have had regarding macro human</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior and its relevance to extropian transhumanism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whenever I am around a crowd, I like to observe its behavior and motions.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't observe individual people, but the crowd as a single unit.  One thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; that has always struck me about crowds is that if evaluated as a single</i><br>
<i>&gt; unit, it behaves almost identically to a simple organism, like a protozoan.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most of the behaviors have direct analogs to the pondwater world.  This has</i><br>
<i>&gt; led me to a couple thoughts regarding the human mind and society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  Despite that every human is an intelligent, sentient being, much of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior appears to stem from the oldest parts of our DNA.  In spite of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary advancement, our net behavior is more or less identical to that</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the oldest organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)  If the net behavior of humanity is really that basic and simple, then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be possible to predict with great accuracy the reaction of the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; population under a given set of conditions and circumstances.  Given a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough model of macroscopic behavior, one should be able to predict with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; high level of certainty the organization of the future world, and outcomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the present one.  A "perfect" model remains to be created however.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3)  Technology has not had any significant net impact on behavior.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; advance of technology has not yet allowed people to overcome our behavioral</i><br>
<i>&gt; DNA, only mask it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One thing that kind of bugs me about this is that I have a suspicion that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; group of the most dedicated extropian transhumanist would behave the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest of humanity if evaluated as a group via hidden observation.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize that it is not easy overcoming millions of years of evolution, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; at some level, I think we are fooling ourselves into thinking that we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; progressing beyond our basic biological imperatives.  If evaluated from afar</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a group, I have a suspicion that Extropians would appear to behave with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same net imperatives as everyone else, even if on an individual level</i><br>
<i>&gt; there were some differences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We may have reached a point where evolution is hindering, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; helping, the development of transhumans.  The fact that we don't notice that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are following these behaviors indicates how fundamental they are.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; timescales we are using for the evolution of transhumans is too small for</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary development.  While our DNA may be appropriate for modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans, it is not appropriate for transhumans, and the influence is</i><br>
<i>&gt; observable in a larger context, no matter how well extropian transhumanists</i><br>
<i>&gt; hide it as individuals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it is impossible for humans in our current state to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian transhumanism.  Maybe attempts at transcending beyond our current</i><br>
<i>&gt; selves is nothing more than superficial; a candy coating on old DNA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

I would say that the only error is your assumption that technology has<br>
had no impact on our behavior. The easiest proof of the opposite would<br>
be to examine the impact of weapons technology on social structures. The<br>
introduction of the gun for example, made armor, swords, spears, and<br>
castles obsolete, thus heralded the end of fuedal aristocracy which<br>
arose out of such technology. The industrial demands of gun technology<br>
necessitated  industrial chemistry, mass production, efficient power<br>
generation technology, and efficient urban centers. This is only one<br>
example.<br>
<p>
Human behavior is shaped by the technology that is used. just look at<br>
the past few decades. Living at the brink of nuclear extinction for so<br>
long has had enough of an impact to make people really see the<br>
usefullness of worldwide peaceful cooperation as opposed to<br>
imperialistic rivalry. This is one of the greatest behavioral changes<br>
ever and it happened right under your nose.<br>
<p>
We extropian transhumanists are as individuals becoming more and more<br>
evolved behaviorally compared to people around us who have not been<br>
associated as we have due to the amount we have steeped ourselves in the<br>
technology of the internet compared to the average person. Living up<br>
here in the sticks, I find myself day by day becoming less and less able<br>
to relate to the people in my community, as they are less and less able<br>
to comprehend the sort of concepts that you and I take for granted as<br>
obvious. As we see more and more technological advancements happening,<br>
or are working on them ourselves, we are becoming less and less human,<br>
and more and more transhuman simply by our concepts, relationships, and<br>
that which we see as given rather than mere possibility.<br>
<p>
It is like the concept of the rich getting richer and the poor getting<br>
not so rich. They aren't getting poorer, they just aren't geting more<br>
rich as quickly as the really rich are. The bell curve of humanity is<br>
expanding to a greater and greater technological and memetic spectrum,<br>
where we will soon have on one planet individuals whose entire existence<br>
will occur on a computer, and individuals who have never seen a digital<br>
watch. Individuals whose personal net worth will be calculated in<br>
planets alongside people who only own the rags on their backs and the<br>
camel they ride.<br>
