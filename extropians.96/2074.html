<i>&gt;  FACT 4: Toxicologist Dr. William Marcus, testified at the congressional</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hearings on Waco that the CS molecule contains a "cyanide radical" that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  could have been transdermally absorbed by the children due to their thin </i><br>
<i>&gt;  skin. CS also converts to hydrogen cyanide upon heating. In fact, surviving</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bodies where found to contain very high levels of cyanide. Dr. Marcus also</i><br>
<i>&gt;  observed that CS is a heavy particle that is suspended in the air like a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  gas only for a brief period when carried by the flammable and toxic agent </i><br>
<i>&gt;  methyl chloride, thus CS particles fall quickly to the ground.  The FBI</i><br>
<i>&gt;  calculated that if spread evenly over the known sq. feet of indoor space, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  the tons of CS pumped in should not have exceeded safe levels. But this </i><br>
<i>&gt;  is a deception because, as CS quickly falls, very high concentrations </i><br>
<i>&gt;  would be found toward the floor along with the children and fallen </i><br>
<i>&gt;  adults, in fact, 10 to 100x higher than if uniformly distributed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I've used CS quite a good many times in military training. One of the standard<br>
means of dispersal is a burning type grenade. While in Korea I set up tear<br>
gas chambers for NBC defense training where the method for dispersal was to <br>
use CS powder heated over an open flame. In both cases I have stood in the <br>
resulting aerosol sans mask for extended periods (once you're used to it, CS <br>
is not all that incapacitating even in pretty high levels). I daresay that if<br>
there were significant levels of cyanide generated from heating of CS in a <br>
normal flame, I would have seen the gray skin, and malaise that comes with <br>
cyanide poisoning.<br>
On the other hand, many plastics, synthetic fabrics and other household items <br>
do generate cyanide in good quantity when exposed to fire. It's one of the <br>
major toxins that cause "death from smoke inhalation" in household and other <br>
fires. So I'm not terribly surprised that the bodies would show high cyanide<br>
levels. That's quite common if the death is from smoke inhalation.<br>
