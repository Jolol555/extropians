<p>
Yes. We'll need an automagical matrix bus transport infrastructure. <br>
<i>&gt;From point to point, to better accomodate diverse web potatoes/wireheads. </i><br>
Pale human maggots, limply wriggling in their stuffy dens, catered to by <br>
briskly crawling insectoid nannybots. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Seen the recent developments in eyeglassless 3D television?</i><br>
<p>
This is not holography. Holography refers to a certain physical principle <br>
used to generate images. Interference patterns, recorded in some <br>
susceptible medium, regenerate the interference produced scenery if <br>
illuminated by a suitable light source. Modulate the patterns (strong<br>
nanotech required) accordingly: voila, your interactive hologram of<br>
of choice hovers in front of you. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I think it will be a wearable augmented reality, where you are carrying </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your computational environment with you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about augmented reality contacts created with nano or perhaps chips</i><br>
<p>
1) Practicability of strong (Drexlerian) nano is uncertain<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; surgically implanted in your eyes?</i><br>
<p>
2) This would render your eye useless (I'd like to see a solid state <br>
camera, which is superior to the human eye (cum retina)). An adult can't <br>
learn to interpret implant input (though this might be induced chemically, <br>
albeit heavily artefacting your personality structure), while babies <br>
probably could.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I always wondered how the world would look if we became dependent on</i><br>
<i>&gt; augmented reality and you took your glasses off. Pretty boring and probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; even falling into disrepair and decay because you wouldn't need to repair</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; something until its nearly ready to break. This could be the transition</i><br>
<p>
Yes. This is the reason I mentioned glamour, which was a magickal device <br>
used by Irish faeries and Skandinavian trolls. Their native environments <br>
was mildly (or strongly) repulsive, they enchanted their senses, and <br>
senses of their victims/visitors (which was sometimes the same).<br>
<p>
Au.R. GUI designers should look into R. Zelazny novels, particularly those<br>
depicting technical aspects of magick. Much can be learned there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;people will work in Au. R -- the step from a mouse pusher, to 6dof cursor </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pusher is not too far ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 6dof cursor pusher? What do you mean?</i><br>
<p>
Pencil pusher--&gt;mouse pusher.<br>
<p>
Six degrees of freedom. A cursor with a Difference: it floats in front of <br>
you (ideally steered by eye tracker, or, even better, by myopotential <br>
headband/implant microelectrode array generated output), allowing you to <br>
intuitively maniplate Au.R. stuff. Will be first used for, and perfected <br>
on, the bodily disabled.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It's the logical choice, the next GUI.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True</i><br>
