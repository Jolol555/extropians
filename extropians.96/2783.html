WHile developing FTL capability would be GREAT, we must make plans on<br>
what is practical, based on extrapolation from _known_ information.<br>
<p>
Anders: Considering that actually going light speed IS impossible,<br>
unless we are mere software riding a laserbeam to a reciever on another<br>
planet, we will be a little more restrained than just the light locus.<br>
Assuming an average 20 light years in our local area between habitable<br>
earthlike worlds (not really neccessary, but a good motivator for the<br>
majority of mere humans), and a requirement to only accelerate and<br>
decellerate at 1 G, the average jump of colonization expansion will take<br>
approximately 22 years, or an average rate of 0.9 C.  THen assuming that<br>
we have a virgin world on the other end, a certain logistical base would<br>
need to be built before the next jump could be attempted. If one has a<br>
significant base of automatons, even nontech, one could concievably send<br>
an automaton scouting party ahead at higher accelerations to prep a<br>
base, which would decrease the lag time between jumps. If up-minds<br>
wished to beam out to the new colony, there would also be a drag on<br>
further expansion by the need to build capacity for the influx of<br>
upminds. This would be a good problem to develop an algorithm for,<br>
possibly another video game, Conquer the Universe or some such.<br>
