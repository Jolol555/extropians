<i>&gt; &gt; things up, when the reason things were dumped before was because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government gave them tax breaks to invest in certain industries, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; refused to build the waste disposal facilities that the businesses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; needed to get rid of the waste. Sotring it was an OSHA health hazard, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they had to get rid of it somewhere. Where they put is was not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; governments responsibility, so long as they didn't dump any where IN MY</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; BACKYARD.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The government was as short sighted as can be, as usual. But the</i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses are still the ones who dumped the waste. The businesses made</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit off the polluting industries, then, when told they had to take care</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the harmful side effects. If the taxpayers gave these people money in</i><br>
<i>&gt; order to make a profit (admittedly, jobs were created, but there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better way than environmental degradation), then why should the taxpayers</i><br>
<i>&gt; pay for the byproducts. It's like giving them money twice for them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make even more money.</i><br>
<p>
If they are short sighted, why do you want them to have the authority?<br>
If the businesses invested under the instigation of the government, the<br>
government has a responsibility to fulfill its end of the bargain. <br>
<p>
Nuclear Power is a phenomenal example: The reason why nuclear power<br>
costs are so high is that, legal costs aside, over 25% of the cost of a<br>
kWh here in the US from a nuke plant are government fees. These fees are<br>
collected, as a part of the licensing agreement, for the specific<br>
purpose of building long term, safe, radioactive waste containment<br>
facilities. The trust fund is now HUGE (about 200 billion dollars), far<br>
more than is needed to build the waste site. Yet does has the government<br>
YET opened a waste site, 50 years after starting this program? Nope.<br>
They just finished building a low level site, which is being contested<br>
by the state gov't it is in, but the high level site, under Yuma<br>
Mountain in the Nevada Desert, where there isn't a drop  of water to<br>
pollute, a fault to tremble, ar a person to scare, for at least 100<br>
miles, is still being fought over, basically because the congressional<br>
delegation from Nevada can't get enough pork barrel project funding from<br>
the congress, and California won't give up the fight it's in with Nevada<br>
of water rights in a completely different issue.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, all the nuke plants across the country must build their own<br>
"temporary" storeage facilities, the cost of which is also added onto<br>
the cost of power generated, plus all the legal fights brought up by the<br>
mere existence of the storeage facility is being there, so the community<br>
gets ticked off...<br>
<p>
See what I mean?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Businesses are subsidized more than taxed. During Reagan's "regime", they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; had a large tax cut for businesses, but the poor were still worse off than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; before.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Excuse me, but income taxes have gone down, and anyone in the US who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; makes less than 20,000 dollars a year pays no net taxes at all, on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; average. Business taxes have gone up, especially on small businesses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; typically owned by a husband and wife, employing less than 50 people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Big monopolistic, non-laissez faire corporations get all the tax breaks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That I can believe. But as soon as a business gets powerful, the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; accepts them as part of the elite, and gives them tax breaks. Taxes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, do not generally starve people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That is only if the people allow a system of government that enables<br>
such oligarcal/monoplistic practices. As Benjamin Franklin said,"A<br>
nation which would give up a certain measure of freedom for greater<br>
security will wind up with neither. People get the government they vote<br>
for, and deservedly so. Just take a look at the election here in the US<br>
as a phenomenal example.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; THe Ogoni in Nigeria. Yet, because they have our economic support, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; don't need anybody else's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IAN: Africa has followed socialism far far more than laissez</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faire, yet you condemn laissez faire for the problems there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't thik of a single socialist government in Africa, especially not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nigeria. Nigeria is a fine capitalism, regardless of the military regime.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You are obviously blind. Try Ethiopia, Botswana, Angola just to name a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; few off the top of my head. Due to the long history of tribal tradition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; paternalistic, socialist regiemes experience high popularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Angola is currently waging war against it's people. I don't know much</i><br>
<i>&gt; about Botswana. Ethiopia is doing relatively well, if it wasn't dealing</i><br>
<i>&gt; with internal breakup with Eritea. Tribalism would not lead to socialism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as least not the type you see. YOu might get socialism within a tribe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but a doubt tribalism would accede to a centralize socialist government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Which is a good thing.</i><br>
<p>
The funny thing Suresh, you quote Marx, Lenin, what have you, but you<br>
completely ignore the KEY tenet of marxist socialist philosophy: that<br>
EVERY economy must first pass through an industrial/capitalist phase to<br>
fully develop the information based society that enables perfect<br>
socialism.  To try to force socialism prematurely is a waste, and can<br>
cause much conflict, bloodshed, tyranny, and even a retrogression into a<br>
fuedalistic state. Not only do you need to get some experience in the<br>
world, but you need to read your Marx a bit more. I did. I followed Sun<br>
Tzu's advice:"Know your enemy, and know yourself."<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IAN: Socialism = universal social debt = totalitarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's an excellent blanket statement, but not much logic behind it. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't see many socialist democracies having a much oppression.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Officially, no. Instead, dissidents are branded as lunatics. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; conception of reality does not concord with the official majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; concept of reality, them you must be insane (that is the accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; definition of insanity). So consequently, you get "socialized", or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "helped", or "reeducated" or simply drugged and electroshocked "for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; own good".  See our way is so fine and good that you must agree that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are helping you get along. You do want to get along don't you..... Here</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the US, one is not "politically correct", or is a sexist, racist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; homophobe, "capitalist" (as if thats a bad thing), or baby seal killer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; even though one is not any of those things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you have any evidence? I've talked to many people from those</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries(Netherlands, other europeans countries like that) , even rabid</i><br>
<i>&gt; skinheads from those places, and they don't compain of any ministry of</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth. I don't hear any reports of the ministry of love coming to pick</i><br>
<i>&gt; people up. This could be because I hang out on the wrong side of the net,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but that's my experience.</i><br>
<p>
Thats because it's called the Ministry of Health, Education, and Welfare<br>
And of course, nobody hears about it, if they did, they would be insane<br>
too, because such things do not happen in a socialist democracy. One is<br>
hallucinatory if they report such things....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; They left the economy alone, which I think means laissez-faire in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; traditional sense. In fact, most of these geographic areas that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; considered "good investing", have a history of human rights violations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; A bank teller tried to convince me to put my money in Latin America or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; South East Asia, two areas that haven't had the best track records for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Funny, huh.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yeah funny like: Cuba, Sandinista Nicaragua, Totalitarian El Salvador,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Guatamala, and Chile. None of which are ( or were in the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nicaragua), laissez faire economies</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; El Salvador certainly was. If the U.S. hadn't pumped 6 billion into</i><br>
<i>&gt; keeping the rich in power, there would be a popular government.  Chile was</i><br>
<i>&gt; since pinochet came into power, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the socialist democratic government, there weren't the same  blatant</i><br>
<i>&gt; disregard for human rights. Nicaragua had a far better record for human</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights under the Sandinistas than under Somoza. Guatamala is a U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; puppet state, so companies like United Fruit can exploit the labour,</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent any attempt at social reform, and make more money.</i><br>
<p>
Now you are blaming everyone but the people for their problems. They get<br>
the government they are willing to put up with. if not they can will and<br>
should get another one. If they like getting repressed, they'll get<br>
that.<br>
<p>
Nicaragua had a good record in the human rights that the liberal media<br>
cares about. The central one, being able to vote for your leaders, was<br>
curiously denied.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you're going to have capitalism, you're going to have government. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; still say we drop both of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What then? How are people going to live? Is everyone going to have their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; own farm, their own factory that makes everything, and their own power</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; plant?  Granted, if (and thats still a big IF) nanotechnology fufills</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; its sci-fi promise, then we can each have all those things, and the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; two bases for trade will be information and relationships/entertainment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but that still requires free trade )i.e. laissez faire capitalism to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; work for maximum benefit for all, but that is still at a very minimum</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 20-50 years down the road. Don't hold your breath.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You can still have trade. Under any system that allows it, people are going</i><br>
<i>&gt; exchange stuff. It's when people who have capital dictate terms to those</i><br>
<i>&gt; who don't that trade fails. Fair trade works, free trade doesn't,  </i><br>
<p>
If I've got something, and you want it, I'm only going to give it to<br>
you  if I can profit at selling it. If thats too much for you then you<br>
need to find someone else who has it cheaper. Thats free trade. What you<br>
are talking about is what is fair for YOU, not anyone else.<br>
<p>
Sorry the world does not work that way. There ain't no such thing as a<br>
free lunch, buddy.<br>
Yes, I<br>
<i>&gt; agree that people should take care of themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; first, but they shouldn't do it at the expense of other people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would like people to become self-sufficient, but that's not going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen anytime soon. Factories and farms are owned by the community, thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody gets a say on what activities the business is doing. No this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not state socialism. It's a business run democratically, so both the</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumers and the workers have input, as to the residents of the area of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the factory.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is. It's called giving every one a free and equal chance to screw<br>
things up. Look at the Kibbutzes in Isreal: if the government wasn't<br>
subsidizing them, they'd be ghost towns. <br>
<p>
Sure polluters should be held liable but should also be given a way to<br>
take care of the problems. 99% of the time, things don't get fixed cause<br>
there is a government regulation in the way.<br>
<p>
You want to talk about businesses ripping people off? Try the<br>
environmental remediation businesses, that are typically owned by people<br>
who used to be government environmental experts who got the laws passed<br>
to clean things up certain ways. They then get their bureaucrat buddies<br>
to create HUGE out of proportion fines, and mandate the certain cleanup<br>
methods that the former bureacrats now are in business to provide.<br>
Consequently, they charge HUGE rates, far above costs, more than any<br>
other business I've even seen, when what they usually do is just mix<br>
dirt with dishwashing soap and then rinse it. (of course, its<br>
conveniently repackaged as "remediation" material, not something that<br>
can be bough for pennies at CostCo. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
No, you REALLY need to get some experience in living in the real world.<br>
youseem to be a good natured sort, but you tend to wish the world worked<br>
in a way that would best suite YOU. Funny thing is Suresh, thats the<br>
basis for free trade. We ALL want the world to work that way, but we are<br>
rational enough to see tha if it did, we would be stepping on everyone<br>
elses toes. We just try to get whats best for us so long as the people<br>
we deal with feel that they are getting whats best for them. That is<br>
free trade. That IS fair and equitable.<br>
<p>
You just don't like people having power over you to make you do what you<br>
don't want to do. Here's a secret: the government has the power to do it<br>
the most. Businesses you can sue to the high heavens, but government<br>
only lets you sue them if they agree to let you sue them. Business only<br>
acts like a government when the government is in their pocket, and it<br>
takes YOU to vote it that way.<br>
<p>
Figure out who your real target is.....<br>
