<i>&gt;&gt;What happened in mid to late seventies was that a few bands, mainly</i><br>

Gee, if we're going to be picky, what about Isao Tomita, Klaus Schultze (sp?),<br>
Morton Subotnic, Walter Carlos, Jan Hammer, Vangellis, Larry Fast...<br>

<i>&gt;The humorous irony that suffuses most of Kraftwerk's compositions</i><br>
<i>&gt;always brings a smile to my face, especially the song they wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the old-style pocket calculators that had musical tones</i><br>

Me too!<br>

<p>
   I am adding<br>
   and subtracting.<br>
   I'm controlling<br>
   and composing.<br>
   By pressing down a special key it plays a little MELody!<br>
<p>
I have the single in English on one side and Japanese on the other. (Dentaku)<br>
The rythm and sound of the lyrics in Japanese makes it especially cool.<br>
To me, the perfect irony is when you express both sides of something--<br>
get enjoyment out of both sides--in this case the perverse joy of silly<br>
technology as well as the, well, the perversity of it--without having to<br>
make exaggerated raised eyebrows or smirks.  Being either "pro" or "anti"<br>
would be boring.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are we as transhumanists willing to accept, learn</i><br>
<i>&gt;from or even value ambivalence regarding technological progress?  Are</i><br>
<i>&gt;we able to laugh at our own hubris and draw strength from that?</i><br>
<p>
Boy if we can't we're going to be bored and maladapted.  I see our<br>
civilization--techies included--as really clueless in the face of its<br>
own technology.  I think we paste things onto ourselves rather than<br>
working out how to fit them to our lives.  To assimilate anything well<br>
requires seeing it and oneself from different points of view, exaggerated<br>
ones even, and manipulating it in different ways.  So Kraftwerk and Gary<br>
Numan and Devo have done good work and the weirdness and irony are more<br>
necessary than sober souls might think.<br>

<i>&gt;[...] i think Max meant here that the character of that music didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;change until the mid to late 70's. (i always keep 1978 as a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;guideline) where it was being produced electronically before, it still had</i><br>
<i>&gt;much in common with more 'traditional' music. I'm not saying it was less</i><br>
<i>&gt;exerimental or less innovating, it just became 'different', less 'emotional'</i><br>
<i>&gt;(or maybe more, depending on your point of view ;-) ), and more 'technical'</i><br>
<i>&gt;in sound.</i><br>
<p>
This is very different from the way I've seen it.  The early electronic<br>
guys (up to the early '70's) were doing weird stuff, avant garde, exploring<br>
what they thought were the frontiers of sound and musical structure.  Sure,<br>
at the same time there were people incorporating electronics into more<br>
traditional and popular music, but electronics still had a raw, new sound,<br>
a sound of pure possibility.  In some ways it seemed more organic than<br>
"natural" sound.  Same for the equipment and methods--an ad hock collection<br>
of unreliable machines connected by a spaghetti of patch cords seems to<br>
have more natural anarchy in it than a midi rig.<br>
<p>
Somehow it all seemed to fall apart around 1978--just when sampled keyboards<br>
and FM synthesis came out, making the old analog methods obsolete.  Musicians<br>
didn't want to explore ur-sound or frontier sound, they wanted to push<br>
buttons to make sounds they already knew about, whether "acoustic" (bank A)<br>
or "electronic" (bank B--for instance my keyboard has a sound called<br>
"Kraftwerk").<br>
<p>
But techno seemed, to me, to adopt the "electronic" sound as a fetish,<br>
affectation, attitude or nostalgia thing.  And, it all seems 120 beats per<br>
minute, 4/4, one or two chords to me, no matter how much filter "eer-<br>
err-oor-oop" and strange sampled vocals are going on.<br>
<p>
I'm being too hard of course, but my point is that the best early<br>
electronics weren't about technology but about raw sound and its<br>
intersection with acoustic and musical perception.  I find music with a<br>
techno attitude to be like 50's retro: tailfins, chrome, neon, The Jetsons<br>
and such.  It holds technology at a distance instead of being *in* it.<br>
<p>
That probably sounds like a contradiction to my praise of Kraftwerk's<br>
irony.  But my point was that Kraftwerk are both "in" it and putting it<br>
"on."  Besides, they were in there early doing some of the real exploration<br>
stuff--like that comb filter sweep and wooden flute piece on the back<br>
side of "Autobahn"--stuff that would throw your mind into a different<br>
place.<br>
<p>
Obviously this is mostly an autobiographical piece about the plasticity<br>
of my mind in different decades.  But still, current techno is not so much<br>
technological as "technological" with quotes around it, a reification of<br>
certain ideas of what technology sounds like.  In that sense earlier<br>
electronic music was more enthusiastically, honestly, unabashedly<br>
or unselfconsciously, technological (in the tool-making sense).  Now I<br>
have insulted a whole genre that I know next to nothing about.<br>
