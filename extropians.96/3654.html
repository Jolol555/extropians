My thoughts on Peer-to-Peer Network economics continue.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Because food "just happens" on our world, free lunches used to exist.<br>
<p>
I view this as Spontaneous Order Personified.  Yet, the population <br>
growth has been part of the cause behind an increasing cost of <br>
living.  In order to stabilize one's ability to own specific <br>
resources and barter for other resources which they lack, the <br>
market was established.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Can we honestly call ourselves free if our existance depends upon<br>
financial gain?<br>
(Or have we developed a law reading 'Thou Shalt Earn a Minimum SOL.')<br>
Should not an advanced race as ourown promote a Zero-Cost-of-Living?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The problem with the current market is that it views marketable <br>
<p>
costs as a measure of contribution.  Richard Stallman, founder of<br>
<p>
the Freeware Foundation, provides many programs at no cost to the<br>
<p>
Unix community.  But does that make his huge contibution valueless?<br>
<p>
Paul Erdos is a similar example, but there's a guy who not only shared<br>
his mathematician's enthusiasm freely, but lived by the free lunch,<br>
as a travelling guest to universities.<br>
<p>
<p>
On one hand, the market decides globally how much an item is worth <br>
according to assumptions that all suppliers will seek increasing price,<br>
while all buyers will seek decreasing cost, and thus a single, global,<br>
numerical index of value is placed on the item.  But on the other hand,<br>
there are some commodities (freeware) that are offered at no cost,<br>
yet are of great value to the 'buyer.'  There are also items that have<br>
variable 'worth' to buyers, but the actual mean value is not reflected<br>
by the level at which the price is set through a binary "buy / not-buy"<br>
indicator.  As I'm fond of saying, "There are six billion individual<br>
economies walking and breathing on this planet."<br>
<p>
It has got to be possible for us to create a system which more <br>
accurately models supply and demand on our planet.  Just as our old<br>
"have / need" society has changed to a "see / want" culture, we <br>
have even greater need to revise our monetary system.<br>
<p>
Would we not benefit from making Academia an optionally free lifestyle?<br>
Doesn't the 'closed system' model of 'no free lunch' create<br>
dimishing returns and inflation due to the perishable nature <br>
of material wealth?<br>
How would we handle the opening of the system if interplanetary <br>
commerce were to begin with Earth and its (impending) colonies?<br>
<p>
Whadda YOU think?<br>
