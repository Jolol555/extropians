<i>&gt;&gt;May I suggest another division? There are both rational and irrational</i><br>
emotions.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I would suggest, instead of a division, a gradation.<br>
<p>
(snip of a post I agree with)<br>
<p>
and... again, <br>
As Natasha Vita More added:<br>
&lt;Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think of<br>
exercising the management of emotions.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes!! and as exercise goes, this is one of the hardest muscles to exercise,<br>
not only because the work may seem unpleasant- and may require therapy or<br>
intense pain, but often because of the stigma surrounding the world view of<br>
emotional weakness (especially men are not encouraged to admit they may need<br>
some "emotional working out"). However, Emotional Intelligence is finally<br>
gaining a place in our vocabulary ( EQ) and is actually being taught to kids<br>
these days.<br>
In the future, I, like Natasha, think rather than abolishing emotion, or<br>
lessening it,  our "emotional landscapes" will become more rewarding, more<br>
rich, more refined.<br>
