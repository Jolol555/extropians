Sounds like a good idea (reminiscent of "forking"). Personally I would <br>
probably spawn many different versions of myself, some with specialized <br>
uses, some free to go wherever they want. One idea would be to create a <br>
search agent version of myself - I know I have partially the right <br>
mentality to do it, and with some brain hacking I might create a Anders <br>
Agent that would be extremely happy looking for information on the Net <br>
all the time. <br>

<p>
What about a kind of mental link, so that you share information? If <br>
something bad happens to you it will feel your pain/fear/etc, and vice <br>
versa (I personally think the angel should have the same rights to <br>
protection from your side). <br>
