        Extropian artwork --visual and other, copies of Extropy Magazine,<br>
Michael Lorrey's upcoming book, books that contain 'extropianesque' themes<br>
and ideas e.g.: "The Physics Of Immortality" by Tipler, nanotechnology books<br>
by Drexler and Regis, books by Moravec, Leary, FM-2030 (and Efstantiary),<br>
Walford...you get the idea.  T-shirts, supplements like DHEA etc., donations<br>
to various institutes.<br>
You could even throw cryonic suspension packages in there! &lt;g&gt;  Maybe a<br>
raffle?  The possibilities are nearly endless.  The problem with this is<br>
that it *might* cheapen the philosophy.  At a 'fiction' convention, extropy<br>
might seem like a 'nice thought' as opposed to an active philosophy.  If we<br>
want extropianism to be publicized, we want it to be done seriously...and<br>
well; otherwise, most people will turn their noses up at what seems<br>
unattainable or unrealistic.<br>
<p>
        Take "Star Trek" for example.  I'm sure that show has many good<br>
ideas presented in it (I rarely watch television), but looking at the mass<br>
publicity of the show, it is apparent that the 'trekkies' can discern that<br>
it is fiction.  Extropy is *not* fiction, and it would be a shame to see it<br>
perceived as such.  My point is that if we (as extropian types) are going to<br>
bring our philosophy to the forefront in a way that can be grokked by the<br>
average individual, we have to do it tastefully and tactfully.  We have the<br>
goods and the knowledge, but we have to convey them carefully, lest extropy<br>
appear a cult to the untrained eye.<br>
