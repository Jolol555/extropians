Okay. Government regulation is "trying" to keep the businesses from<br>
hurting the public. I think things like environmental regulations and<br>
health safety standards try, at least, to help the consumer. If there<br>
weren't any such regulations, companies could easily get away with doing<br>
dumping and selling hazardous products. Which they would. Companies are<br>
adept enough at manipulating media that they can paint a benevolent image<br>
of themselves with one hand and hurt people with the other. Nestle, for<br>
example.<br>
<p>
<p>
Businesses are subsidized more than taxed. During Reagan's "regime", they<br>
had a large tax cut for businesses, but the poor were still worse off than<br>
before. <br>
<p>
<p>

<i>&gt;  &gt; Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it. </i><br>

<i>&gt; IAN: Africa has followed socialism far far more than laissez </i><br>
<i>&gt; faire, yet you condemn laissez faire for the problems there.</i><br>
<p>
I can't thik of a single socialist government in Africa, especially not<br>
Nigeria. Nigeria is a fine capitalism, regardless of the military regime. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Your claim that decentralization leads to centralization </i><br>
<i>&gt; (therefore we need centralization to prevent decentralization)</i><br>
<i>&gt; has no basis in fact. It is regulations and taxation that reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number of business, not the opposite. Learn about Hong Kong.</i><br>
<p>
You cannot decentralize the government aspect of things without giving<br>
free reign to the business side of things. If you're going to have a free<br>
market, you're going to need a government to keep the private interests in<br>
check. Unless you reduce both drastically, they are both neccessary.<br>
Giving one preference is invitation to totalitarianism. Power is<br>
centralized both on the market side and on the government side. GIving one<br>
control over the other doesn't help much. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Socialism = universal social debt = totalitarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That's an excellent blanket statement, but not much logic behind it. I<br>
don't see many socialist democracies having a much oppression.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Batista, Duvalier, Suharto, and Duarte all ran with capitalism, and yet </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; they were, (still are in the case of Suharto), completely totalitarian. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; This is because the government was run for and by the private interests. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Which is what I think happens with laissez faire.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Laissez faire means "leave alone." </i><br>
<i>&gt; A totalitarian govt is by definition not laissez faire.</i><br>
<p>
They left the economy alone, which I think means laissez-faire in the<br>
traditional sense. In fact, most of these geographic areas that are<br>
considered "good investing", have a history of human rights violations.<br>
A bank teller tried to convince me to put my money in Latin America or<br>
South East Asia, two areas that haven't had the best track records for<br>
freedom.<br>
Funny, huh. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I live in Canada, which is a fairly good  liberal socialism. I agree with </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Banjo that capitalism needs a bit of government in order to keep it from </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; running amuck. ... i think we need to get a strong populist government.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Well at least you've dropped the anarchist pretense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
If you're going to have capitalism, you're going to have government. I<br>
still say we drop both of them. <br>
