In the discussion between Eugene Leitl and Robin Hanson about social science <br>
experiments, they bring up the difference between Experimentation and <br>
Observation.  I think Eugene is correct; observation is _part_ of <br>
experimentation.  However, I would just like to point out that experimentation <br>
is simply a way of setting up interesting things to observe.  Science is about <br>
making sense of our observations.  The experimental aspect is simply to <br>
intentionally create some phenomena that one is interested in observing, <br>
rather than waiting around for it to just happen on its own, since in most <br>
cases it's not likely to happen on its own, and even if it does, you're not <br>
likely to be there to observe it carefully.  Thus, we can get a large sampling <br>
of observations which we have set up to be very similar in most respects and <br>
varied in particular, chosen respects.  Then we have enough observational data <br>
to reasonably fit our theories to.  If the things we wanted to study <br>
spontaneously arose and varied themselves in precicely the ways we would if we <br>
were setting them up as an experiment, then we wouldn't have to experiment at <br>
all, just observe carefully and theorize.  But alas, the world isn't so <br>
cooperative, so we must go out of our way to set up and vary interesting <br>
phenomena to observe.<br>
