No.<br>

In theory you could, in practice you could not, at least not unless you had a <br>
HUGE amount of cleverness or a COSMIC amount of patience. To break a good <br>
random number generator like Blum Blum Shub, the one that PGP uses, you would <br>
need to factor the number that it uses as its seed. If as is usually the case, <br>
the seed is one or two thousand bits long, then you will not be able to find<br>
enough silicon in the observable universe to make enough chips for a computer <br>
to factor it before the heat death of the universe. Unless a new factoring <br>
algorithm was found that is a LOT faster than anything we know about today,  <br>
if it only speeded thing up a trillion times it would be useless; and unless <br>
somebody makes a Quantum Computer, Blum Blum Shub is safe.<br>
<p>
Even if you knew the seed number I used in my generator, I could give you a <br>
sequence produced by this generator and you couldn't even say there is a 51%  <br>
chance that the next bit in the sequence will be a 1, nor could you know  <br>
anything about a bit previous to the sequence I gave you.<br>
