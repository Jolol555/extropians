"People who brandish naturalistic principles at us are usually up to<br>
mischief", warns biologist Sir Peter Medawar, in _The Future Of Man_. He<br>
points out the danger of using "naturalistic" or biological arguments to<br>
attempt to set<br>
up values:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
And yet, and yet...<br>
<p>
Permit me to observe that people who brandish *principles* of any <br>
sort are frequently selling something.  I know I am. :)<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;<br>
"...Our policies and intentions are not to be based upon the supposition<br>
that Nature knows best; that we are at the mercy of natural laws, and flout<br>
them at our peril. It is a profound truth ... that Nature does not know<br>
best; that<br>
genetical evolution, if we choose to look at it liverishly instead of with<br>
fatuous good humor, is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and<br>
blunder."<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Who was it who said "It is as impossible to tell what one ought to do <br>
from watching other people as it is impossible to tell what one ought <br>
*not* to do from looking at other people"?<br>
<p>
I may have missed something in the thread thus far. In fact, I almost <br>
certainly have. If your point is that "it's NATURAL" is an ethical <br>
semantic null, I agree.<br>
<p>
Or am I missing your point here?<br>
<p>
The problem with design has to do with the burden on the designer to <br>
be omniscient. All design is hubris, to some degree or another. <br>
Perhaps all choice is design. Or if it isn't, perhaps it ought to be?<br>
<p>
I've spent half a decade tuning my personal  autopilot to be less cranky. <br>
I hope you're not saying I ought to dispense with it now that I'm <br>
getting the hang of it? <br>
