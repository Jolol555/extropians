See? The harm's done, already. The advent of Singularity is _not_ <br>
certain, things sadly sigmoidal can delay it indefinitely (no, there is <br>
no such thing as a catastrophic breakdown in existance). Where will there<br>
be a decent suspension procedure, when you will need it, when cursing and <br>
moaning, while vomiting bile and gasping for air upon your deathbed?<br>
 <br>
Consider the amount of qualified _scientists_ (not even good scientists) <br>
doing cryonics research, however puny. The area is virtually uncharted, <br>
very little quantitative work has been done. Heck, even the entire <br>
cryobiology discipline does not have _that_ many researchers.<br>
<p>
Even a single more competent individual would mean a large difference. <br>
Carving out a comfortable living in IT business seems straightforward, yet <br>
the world has a lot of IT professionals, already. Definitive results, <br>
whether positive or crushing, would be highly desirable. Don't hesitate to <br>
devote your life to cryobiology, even if you will never get rich in the <br>
process.<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. Currently not doing cryonics research, not signed up either.<br>
