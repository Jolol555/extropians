well obviously.<br>
<p>
 Until his IA implant malfunctions<br>

<i>&gt;perceived by the media.</i><br>
hehe Max More the AntiChrist!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He (together with Tom Morrow) coined the term 'Extropian', started the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian movement, edits and publishes Extropy magazine, organizes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extro conferences and is more active (through articles, debates &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;interviews) in defining and promoting Extropianism than anyone else. Can</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone claim to be doing more ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As far as perception is concerned, Max is clearly recognized by the media</i><br>
<i>&gt;and by most people who know about Extropianism as its leading proponent.</i><br>
Very True, I'd like to obtain the media status he has. I MUST get more<br>
involved in this. I have always believed in ideas like this since I was a<br>
little kid but I had always looked for a group where they lumped them<br>
together as promoting the idea of a positive future but had never found one.<br>
Then finally my english teacher who subscribed to skeptic, knew I was into<br>
future technology, etc and handed me the pamphlet about the extropians so<br>
after that I was glued to the websites and couldn't get enough. Only I must<br>
say that Max should get a new picture, cause I see that same picture of him<br>
on every publication. Also do any Extropians go to El Camino College? I'd<br>
like to meet some of you if you happen to go there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This does not mean that we always agree with him, that he is always right or</i><br>
<i>&gt;that others should not express their own opinions. If he doesn't keep</i><br>
<i>&gt;extroping he might even be disposed.</i><br>
True but I doubt he'll ever do that unless senility gets to him before<br>
uploading.<br>
