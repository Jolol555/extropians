<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; mindless lemmingish masses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I can't believe you really mean that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Whats wrong with what I said? This is the reason there has never to my</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge been a government without a leader to inspire the people. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem is unfortunetly that low intellect people (usually poor) cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; relate to a process like a group and can only relate to a personality which</i><br>
<i>&gt; explains why Clinton was elected. hehe :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
There is only a very loose correlation between income (or net worth)<br>
and intellect.  There's a much stronger correlation between income<br>
and economic system.  I disagree that the "masses" need a fuehrer.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; In the eyes of the public as yet, Max is the "central extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; authority".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No, he isn't.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then who is in the eyes of the mass media. Someone must be? Are do they see</i><br>
<i>&gt; us as a group only without a leader.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If they don't then they _should_.  People with representative opinions,<br>
yes, but "leaders", no.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;A number of us enjoyed Wade's post.  Again, why not ask him yourself?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alright</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another thing... Who is that FM-2030 guy? I saw him in a review in Skeptic</i><br>
<i>&gt; and nowhere else is he mentioned. Who the hell is that guy?</i><br>
<p>
Formerly known as "F. M. Esfandiary", author of *Upwingers*,<br>
*Are You a Transhuman?*, and a number of other works.  He's been<br>
around cryonics &amp; immortalist circles since the late 60's.  A<br>
nice guy.  I have some political and economic disagreements with<br>
him, but I like his spirit.<br>
