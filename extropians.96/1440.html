Dan Clemmensen says,  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An individual will be able to produce essentially everything needed </i><br>
<i>&gt; for a lavish lifestyle, with none of the costs associated with trade. </i><br>
<p>
In other words, Extropian Nanotech, or MNT, as defined here, <br>
means a Cornucopia of self-contained genie machines, in which the <br>
entire economy is mapped onto a small system that can be owned, <br>
maintained, and operated by an individual, and each individual has one.   <br>
In this scenario, there is no trade.  <br>
<p>
The question to ask is:  why is there trade now?  <br>
<p>
Suppose you have an economy in which all individuals have genie <br>
machines.  They all try to be self-sufficient, to the extent that their <br>
genie machines allow this.  So our starting point is an economy <br>
similar to early feudalism, when it first emerged from the ruins of the <br>
Roman Empire.  Each local Baron had his own farm, his own orchard, <br>
his own cattle.  He and his village made their own clothes, their own <br>
horseshoes, their own houses, everything they needed.  They even made <br>
their own tools.   A Baronial estate was a very coarse-grained version of <br>
a genie machine.  It could produce anything, if "anything" is construed <br>
in a generic sense:  some kind of food (not necessarily very good), <br>
some kind of clothes (not necessarily very good), and so forth.   <br>
Our MNT scenario is a high-tech version of this, in which each individual <br>
has a very fine-grained genie machine based on nanotechnology, <br>
which can produce anything the world economy can produce.  <br>
<p>
The Gradient Theorem.  <br>
I think it is a theorem in economics that if the genie machines are finite, <br>
then the MNT scenario is not stable.  Any approximation to it is unstable.  <br>
In fact, there is a gradient away from self-sufficiency, in the direction of <br>
more trade.  <br>
<p>
By "finite" I mean:<br>
     1. The genie machines use energy (they are not perpetual motion <br>
machines). <br>
      2. The genie machines perform their tasks at some measurable rate  <br>
(not instantaneously), and different tasks take different times. <br>
      3.  The cost of retooling or reprogramming a machine is nonzero, <br>
and the cost varies depending on what kind of retooling is done.  <br>
      4. The genie machines have an interface that requires some <br>
expertise and effort on the part of the user -- genie machines have to be <br>
programmed, rather than merely commanded.  (Or if they can be <br>
commanded, the commands have to be so detailed that it is a lot of <br>
trouble to give them properly, so "commanding" amounts to the same <br>
thing as "programming.")  Different tasks requite different degrees of <br>
expertise and effort.  <br>
<p>
If the output of a genie machine depends to some extent on the effort <br>
put into it by its user/programmer, then all genie machines will not be <br>
equal, any more than all humans are equal (or all Baronial estates).  <br>
Each of us will have his/her own unique genie machine, just like we all <br>
have a computer, we all have a set of tools of some kind, we all have a <br>
personal library, and so forth.  No two are exactly alike.  We not only <br>
have different hardware, we also have different skills.  There will <br>
always be differences in the effectiveness of different individuals at <br>
performing different tasks, even when they are using genie machines.  <br>
People will be power users of some features of their genie machine, and <br>
never get around to reading the user's manual for many other features.  <br>
<p>
Therefore trade will exist, for the same reason it exists now.  <br>
<p>
The existence of trade means that the various genie machines and their <br>
operators will be in communication with each other, offering various <br>
services.  This will lead to more specialization, not less.  Individuals <br>
will tailor their genie machines and their skills to the market.  They will <br>
find that it is in their economic interest to specialize, rather than try to <br>
do everything.  Self-sufficient Baronial estates will give way to an <br>
economy based on trade. <br>
<p>
Finiteness Assumption #4 is crucial here.  If this assumption is false -- i.e. <br>
if the genie machine requires no effort or skill -- then we will all be <br>
power users of all the functions of our genie machines, and there will be <br>
no need for trade.  <br>
<p>
Finiteness Assumption #4 is certainly true for computers as they <br>
presently exist.  My computer is a genie machine, in the sense that it <br>
can produce any software I ask it to produce.  I could "ask" it to make <br>
me a word processor, if I wanted to.  But "asking" is a rather tedious <br>
process.  I would have to write the program, compile it, test it, debug it, <br>
install it... It would require a lot of effort that could be better employed <br>
elsewhere.  I would rather buy a word processor from someone who is <br>
devoting a lot of resources to the task.  I would rather spend my time <br>
doing what I am good at, and let other people do what they are good at.  <br>
<p>
That's why there is trade now:  every task requires some nonzero effort, <br>
and different tasks requires different degrees of effort (and different <br>
amounts of time).  This leads to specialization and trade.  <br>
<p>
In the MNT scenario, asking the genie machine for a word processor is <br>
not tedious at all.  Making a word processor requires no more effort <br>
than anything else.  All I have to do is describe it, and presto, it's here.  <br>
<p>
If it requires *any* more effort than that -- in other words, if there is <br>
any significant difference between the effort required to produce <br>
different items -- then the situation is unstable.  The inequality of effort <br>
will create a gradient leading away from self-sufficiency, toward an <br>
economy with trade and ever-increasing specialization.  <br>
