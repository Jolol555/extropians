When I wrote about the benefits of offending people, I forgot to clarify what <br>
I mean by "offending" them.  I certainly don't mean insulting them personally <br>
or ridiculing their beliefs.  This usually closes minds beyond much hope of <br>
opening.  I was meaning that sometimes it is good to present one's ideas very <br>
bluntly and matter-of-factly, with no sugar coating.  If the other doesn't <br>
share your ideas, this will usually create an intellectual offense at your <br>
ideas.  They will be offended, not because your ideas are bad, or you are <br>
being rude to them, but because you are presenting them with ideas which may <br>
seem ludicrous at first or frightening, or simply very different than they are <br>
familiar with.<br>
<p>
And because it is more of an intellectual offense than an emotional one (not <br>
that there's a clear-cut difference between the two), they will tend to use <br>
more of an intellectual defense, to rebutt what you're saying.  An emotional <br>
defense would be to block out or marginalize what you are saying, and one <br>
should avoid triggering another's emotional defenses too much when sharing <br>
one's ideas with another (and this is much easier to do through text, where <br>
the participants aren't face to face, or voice to voice).<br>
<p>
The offense is intended to provoke an intellectual response and get the other <br>
*thinking* about what you're saying, not necessarily to *accept* what you're <br>
saying.  One must trust the rational faculties of the other to reach their own <br>
conclusions, rather than simply inserting your own ideas into their mind as a <br>
belief.  The trick is to get them thinking in the first place.  Unless they've <br>
thought about your ideas for themselves, their "agreement" with your ideas is <br>
meaningless.<br>
<p>
Of course, some care must be taken when spreading memes, not to be too <br>
offensive (otherwise the recipient will just close up), and not to present the <br>
ideas too sweetly and innocently (otherwise the ideas won't challenge their <br>
mind enough to get them to *care* about what you say).  <br>
<p>
I'm not an expert on effective communication (although I'm very interested in <br>
becoming so), but I think that some amount of offense (not insult) can be very <br>
good in the communication process, especially when spreading Extropian ideas, <br>
which encourage people to think for themselves.  If you're just interested in <br>
slipping ideas into people's minds, then a very quiet, non-offensive technique <br>
is probably the best.  But I'm interested in getting people to THINK and not <br>
be so comfortable with their ideas, to continually question and doubt. And for <br>
this, there must be some serious boat rocking.<br>
<p>
We need a world of thinkers, not a world of believers (no matter how good the <br>
belief is), and I'd rather have someone question what I say than believe it.  <br>
At least I know they're still alive.<br>
