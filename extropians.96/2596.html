<i>&gt;interruption of a million years would make no difference to the upload, if </i><br>
<i>&gt;they carry on then just as they were before.  The "stream of consciousness" </i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't have to be flowing all the time; it can stop and start, but as long as </i><br>
<i>&gt;it always picks up right where it left off, it is still the same "stream of </i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness".  As long as uploading faithfully copies the computational </i><br>
<i>&gt;process that is your consciousness, you will be uploaded AS you.  There may be </i><br>
<i>&gt;disagreement about how accurately an uploading process can copy your </i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness however.  But as long as it doesn't alter it any more than it </i><br>
<i>&gt;typically gets altered in the normal course of events, I see no way to argue </i><br>
<i>&gt;that the upload isn't as really you as you are.  But, we'll just have to wait </i><br>
<i>&gt;around and see how good the technology is (of course, those of us who are </i><br>
<i>&gt;interested should actually get out and work on this technology, rather than </i><br>
<i>&gt;sitting around waiting for someone else to do it).</i><br>
<p>
I don't think the argument is whether or not what is uploaded is equivalent<br>
to you.  The argument is whether what is uploaded is the *same* as you.<br>
Equivalence and sameness are very different, especially when factors such as<br>
self-awareness come into play.  Although a self-aware program cannot tell<br>
the difference between equivalent instances of its own program, it can tell<br>
the difference between itself and other instances.  <br>
<p>
There is a parallel to this in the computer world.  Consider what happens if<br>
you start two copies of Microsoft Word on your computer.  You have two<br>
identical programs both running in the memory of your computer, quite<br>
possibly in exactly the same state.  Question: how does your operating<br>
system tell the difference between two copies of identical software in<br>
exactly the same state?<br>
The answer is that every instance of Microsoft Word has an externally<br>
identifiable signature that only has significance to the operating system<br>
and other programs.  When the Word program is running, it operates only in<br>
its own context. It does not require knowledge of the signature to run<br>
perfectly.<br>
<p>
Note that the signature is based on spatial and physical properties of each<br>
instance of Microsoft Word, since there is no other possible way of<br>
distinguishing identical programs.  In the case of computers, this would be<br>
a RAM address.  You could start and stop each instance of Word as many times<br>
as you like and the signature, hence identity, would remain the same.<br>
<p>
The signature is essentially the "self-awareness" of the program.  A program<br>
is deleted by changing or erasing this signature.  Suppose now that you copy<br>
one of the running copies to a whole new block of memory and continue<br>
execution exactly at the point it was at before you copied it.  This would<br>
automatically generate a new signature by definition.  In the context of the<br>
running program, nothing would have changed.  From an external context<br>
however, it would be an entirely different instance of the program that was<br>
just running before it moved.<br>
<p>
The point to all this is that even though your consciousness "felt" the same<br>
after upload internally, external observers would only recognize an<br>
equivalence, not a sameness.<br>
