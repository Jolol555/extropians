<i>&gt; to eat animals?  This prompts more thinking of why we consider *anything* to</i><br>

<i>&gt; uninjured as possible.  But what about me hurting other people?  If they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who I may wish to trade with, which would help me achieve my goals, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be "wrong" (in the goal-interference sense) for me to injure them or do</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything to them to cause them to perform for me in a degraded manner.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; what about people whom I have no dealings with?  If they are capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurting me or interfering with my goals in other ways, I certainly wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to provoke them to do that; creating enemies is not in my best interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But what if they are defenseless and powerless?  Then why should I care about</i><br>
<i>&gt; them?  Perhaps driving them off their land or even killing them would actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; help me achieve certain goals.  Would it be "wrong" to do then?  Certainly not</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a goal-interference sense, since the murdering is helping me achieve my</i><br>
<i>&gt; goals.  But are there any realistic ethical concerns besides goal attainment?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know.  This would be interesting to discuss.</i><br>

I'm not much of a cook, but if it were on the menu I'd probably try it.<br>

My own theory of memetics^* puts the "don't eat people" meme into the<br>
Altruistic Class. Such memes survive because they protect the continued<br>
existence of other available hosts, and allow continued close contact<br>
between potential hosts. It is very easy for such memes to be picked up<br>
as part of an environmentally stable strategy (ESS) because close host<br>
contact allows the "trade" meme and "specialization" memes to work<br>
together to the benefit of individual hosts. Such close contact also<br>
allows the quick spread of new memes through the local population, and<br>
this homogenization reinforces any local ESS.<br>
<p>
There is a meme of the Symbiotic Class which I call "young fuzzy animals<br>
are<br>
people too" which has evolved to take advantage of the imprinting<br>
process<br>
which creatures smart enough to host even simple memetic patterns go<br>
through at an early age. This meme has survived because of the<br>
usefulness<br>
of the domestication of non-food animals (specifically dogs) which made<br>
good<br>
symbiotic partners when primitive man made them part of the tribe.<br>
(house<br>
cats are just parasites exploiting this meme to gain survival advantage)<br>
<p>
Vegetarianism practiced on moral grounds is a combination/mutation of<br>
the "don't eat people" meme and the "young fuzzy animals are people too"<br>
meme into an "all animals are people too and therefore should not be<br>
eaten"<br>
meme. Since heart disease is a big killer, and can be linked to high fat<br>
diets, this meme may convey a degree of host survival advantage. <br>
