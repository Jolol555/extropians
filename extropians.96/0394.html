<p>
IAN: Thus the political planners and elite must be pushing for lower <br>
taxes, less regulation, and more individual liberty on all fronts. I <br>
only wish I could agree. In fact, they are pushing for higher taxes, <br>
more regulations, and less liberty on all fronts. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; For their own selfish ends, the members of the conspiracy would be better </i><br>
<i> &gt; served by changing their ways than they would be by attempting to enslave </i><br>
<i> &gt; the planet. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: True, but free people can more easily resist and compete with <br>
the central planning elite. We can't have that. If you told a king,<br>
tyrant or dictator that he would be better off if he relaxed his <br>
control over his subjects, he'd laugh in your face before he <br>
sent you off to the rack.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; And even if the governing elite is too lazy and stupid to study economics</i><br>
<i> &gt; and social epistemology, surely they make a practice of hiring expert</i><br>
<i> &gt; researchers, and some of the researchers they hire are informing them </i><br>
<i> &gt; of these facts.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: You'd figure the lessons of the last century would have to <br>
teach them something. The point is it's a matter of being over <br>
other people. Control itself is the goal for political types.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; In short, to hold up your argument, you need to show that it is in the</i><br>
<i> &gt; interests of the governing elite to enslave the population of the world.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: No -- to hold up the argument one need only show that they are <br>
working overtime to reduce freedoms. They are... any questions ? <br>
<p>
Those who seek total power are willing to sacrifice material wealth in <br>
the form of new consumer technologies, medicine, ideas, etc., for the <br>
goal of social domination. It's a trade off their willing to make, <br>
even *if* they realize that the one must exclude the other. <br>
