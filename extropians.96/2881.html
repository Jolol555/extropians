The reason it took a day and a half for the post to appear is you used<br>
a "::" to prefix your comments. This was the command prefix for the<br>
old extropian mailing list. Since a lot of people still try to send <br>
those commands to the new mailing list, I have all messages that start<br>
with the double colon bounce to me for approval. If you want your message<br>
to show up in a timely manner, use a different quote prefix.<br>
