I just finished watching a Nature show on television, titled, "Designed for <br>
Living".  It showed all different kinds of animals building their homes, using <br>
a tremendous variety of technologies.  There were different kinds of birds <br>
building nests, some doing detailed weaving of small nests, as well as whole <br>
communities of sparrows building one-ton haystacks in trees.  Small sea <br>
creatures were shown selecting grains of sand of fairly uniform size and <br>
shape, and using silk to adhere the grains together, encasing themselves in a <br>
protective shell.  Beavers were shown gathering sticks and logs they felled <br>
and building large, sturdy dams in rivers.  Various kinds of wasps were shown <br>
using very different building materials and techniques to build very different <br>
kinds of homes.  Various rodents were shown burrowing tunnels in the ground <br>
and bringing in insulating materials, such as leaves.<br>
<p>
Watching all these different animals building their homes, I was struck by the <br>
profound connection between them and humans.  It was like, "Oh, my god!  <br>
They're using technology.  They're just like us!"  I watched the ways these <br>
different animals moved their bodies as they built their structures, the <br>
efficient way they gathered materials and carefully placed them, and it looked <br>
very much as though they were being controlled tele-robotically by humans -- <br>
their actions were so intelligent.<br>
<p>
It even seems like these various animals are passing on their technology <br>
memetically.  It seems like each generation of animal learns from the previous <br>
ones and pass their designs on to the next generations.  The designs change <br>
slowly over time, and it's interesting to see different groups of wasps or <br>
termites who are very similar physically but very different culturally and who <br>
use very different styles of architecture and even different types of building <br>
materials.  Ancient humans were actually very much like that, where the ways <br>
of living and technology were passed on, changed very little, for thousands of <br>
generations.  The only real difference between modern humans and ancient <br>
humans and other animals seems to be that we are currently modifying our <br>
designs very quickly and trying lots of new things.  <br>
<p>
But even this isn't all that different from the behaviors of ancient humans <br>
and other animals.  While engaged in a task, animals attempt to accomplish <br>
particular goals and often encounter obstacles which they must overcome, and <br>
they modify their approach until they find one which helps them achieve their <br>
goals.  Human animals have basically stumbled upon discoveries, such as <br>
planting seeds, which made it much easier to secure a steady supply of food, <br>
and thus their natural problem-solving skills, which all animals share, to <br>
some degree, were able to be used for other problems, such as designing more <br>
efficient ways of hauling things around or more aesthetically pleasing and <br>
useful objects.  Modern technology is essentially the same sort of activity <br>
ancient humans were engaged in, and it is essentially the same sort of <br>
activity that many other animals are engaged in also.  We've just speeded up <br>
the same process which has been happening on this planet for many millions of <br>
years.<br>
<p>
We have not departed from nature, as many claim.  We are still in the midst of <br>
it, just as strongly as before.  Like the native americans praised the wisdom <br>
of following the example of animals, we too follow that example, with our <br>
technology.  Animals are technological creatures.  If we watch them, we see <br>
how they use materials in their environments to build structures to live in <br>
and devices to build their homes and gather food.  Animals vary their designs <br>
over time.  Our only difference is that we vary our designs at a faster rate <br>
and we recognize and cast aside unsuccessful methods at a much faster rate <br>
than other animals do.  But our "essence" is the same -- the underlying <br>
technological behavior is the same.<br>
<p>
A new development among animals, happening among the humans, is the awareness <br>
of and concern for the larger environment.  Generally, in nature, organisms <br>
are concerned only with their immediate environment, and they carry out their <br>
technological activities, oblivious to the larger ecological consequences of <br>
their actions.  Until fairly recently, humans did this too (and most humans <br>
still do).  It seems kind of ironic, but this concern with the larger <br>
environment that the Environmentalists advocate seems in many ways to be very <br>
'unnatural'.  It's actually not unnatural at all.  Our awareness of the larger <br>
environment is a direct result of our very natural technological progress.  <br>
Because of our technology, we can put sattelites in orbit around the planet to <br>
monitor various aspects of the planet, and through computers, we can combine <br>
information from the sattelites and other data-collecting devices on earth, to <br>
obtain an understanding of how the biosphere works and our impact on it.  <br>
Thus, we can make more intelligent decisions.<br>
<p>
This is a recurring theme of mine, that humans and technology are completely <br>
natural, that there is nothing wrong with technological progress.  I think <br>
it's important that people develop an understanding of the nature of <br>
technology and intelligent activity.  I believe that we are most in tune with <br>
Nature and with our own nature when we are engaged in the process of <br>
technology, the process of finding creative and intelligent solutions to our <br>
problems.  Life is a process of technology, and the more fully engaged we are <br>
in the technological process, the more fully alive we are.<br>
