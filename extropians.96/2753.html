<i>&gt;I've never heard of the "Information can not be moved only copied" Theorem </i><br>
<i>&gt;and I am not totally ignorant in such matters, but if it really exists please  </i><br>
<i>&gt;tell me exactly what it means. Why it is concrete and practical if as you say </i><br>
<i>&gt;it has nothing to do with "the physical context"? How would our physical </i><br>
<i>&gt;Universe be the slightest bit different if it were untrue? </i><br>
<p>
The manipulation and usage of information has many concrete and practical<br>
applications, even if information itself has no physical properties.<br>
Information by definition does not have physical properties.  This is one of<br>
the reasons it can be encoded on virtually any substrate.  <br>
<p>
The "Information cannot be moved, only copied" theorem operates under the<br>
assumption that information must be encoded on a substrate to exist.<br>
The theorem basically states that if you have a unique piece of information<br>
encoded on substrate "a", you cannot encode the information on substrate "b"<br>
if the information does not also concurrently exist on "a".  If the unique<br>
piece of information was not encoded on a substrate at the time it was to be<br>
encoded on "b", the information would simply not exist, and therefore be<br>
unencodable.<br>
                <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;Another interesting mathematically proven theorem of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;information science:  It is mathematically impossible for</i><br>
an                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;information agent (such as humans or computers) to prove</i><br>
that               <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;their information is synchronized with that of another        </i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;information agent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I not sure I know what you mean by "synchronized", but it is true that Godel   </i><br>
<i>&gt;proved in 1930 that any mathematical system with a finite number of axioms </i><br>
<i>&gt;will be inconsistent or incomplete, some things are just undecideable. For a </i><br>
<i>&gt;few years after Godel made his discovery it was hoped that we could at least  </i><br>
<i>&gt;identify those undecideable things, that is, statements that were either </i><br>
<i>&gt;false or true but had no proof. If we could do that then we would know we </i><br>
<i>&gt;were  wasting our time looking for a proof and we could move on to other </i><br>
<i>&gt;things, but in 1935 Turing proved that sometimes even that was impossible.</i><br>
<p>
This is probably the basis for the theorem.  It does directly impact the<br>
development of distributed systems and data replication schemes.  A class on<br>
distributed system theory is where I first came across it.  Data latency is<br>
the mechanism which generates the instance of this theorem in distributed<br>
systems.<br>
<p>

<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;Self-awareness allows a block of information to uniquely</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;recognize itself without necessarily having any</i><br>
differences                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;between itself and it's  copies.                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Huh?? This mechanism finds a difference between 2 blocks of information that  </i><br>
<i>&gt;you admit have no differences! How on earth does it manage to do that? </i><br>
<i>&gt;What does it even mean?</i><br>
<p>
If you meet a set of identical twins, they know who is who, even if it is<br>
impossible for you to tell the difference.  No matter how similar they are,<br>
every consciousness has a unique self identity.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;                &gt;The monkey might bang out plays, but they would no longer</i><br>
be                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;Shakespeare's plays because there would be no evidence in</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;the universe that Shakespeare ever wrote a play. They</i><br>
would                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;be random noise generated by a monkey pounding on a</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;typewriter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;"MacBeth" would never be random noise, even if a monkey produced it.</i><br>
<p>
It would still be random noise, albeit noise with interesting literary<br>
significance to it.<br>
