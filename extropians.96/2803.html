                 <br>
<p>
Well then, despite what I have always thought I am not an Anarchist, I don't <br>
see how any sane man could be. I certainly believe in authority, I think my <br>
bank has the authority to stop you from spending my money and I think my PPA <br>
should have the authority to stop you from killing me. My doctor may have the<br>
authority to cut me open with a knife, but you have no such authority.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;time period preceding. </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I assume you're talking about the 19'th century, and it's true, life was  <br>
pretty grim compared to now, but it's more meaningful to compare it to things  <br>
as they were before the 19'th century, not as they are now. Never before in  <br>
Human History had the average person been so rich or lived so long. Never  <br>
before in Human History had there been greater advances in Science or <br>
Technology.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;It has no institutionalized authority. Which I see has                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;having no government.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
If there is no institutionalized authority who runs the elections? You don't <br>
believe in managers so people will need to vote about every 10 minutes. <br>
Who stops the black market? If your factory votes to sell its product for $10, <br>
and another factory a thousand miles away votes to sell the same thing for $5,  <br>
you're going to need another institution, in this case storm troopers, <br>
to stop me from buying from them.<br>
                <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;&gt; 2) At any one time in any one place, only one [government]                 </i><br>

<p>
<i>                &gt;Suresh:                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Not so. You can have hordes and hordes of them, all over.                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;If you don't like one, leave                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And that is exactly why what you're proposing is a government, it's not <br>
enough that I quit, I must leave. In a true anarchy if I want to change from <br>
one PPA to another, all I have to do is pick up a phone, tell the new PPA my <br>
credit  card number for the premium, and that's it. I don't have to move <br>
anywhere.       <br>
                <br>

<i>                &gt;&gt;The consumers can vote  for higher quality, lower prices and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;less pollution. The workers can vote for higher wages, more          </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;time off, and better health care. It's paradise, everybody's                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;happy.                </i><br>
                <br>
<i>                &gt;Suresh:     </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Please, do you really have that kind of disrespect for people. </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
I like people, some of my best friends are people, but I do have that kind of  <br>
disrespect, contempt might be a better word, for elections. The workers can  <br>
vote to give themselves any wage they please, but the idea that they will  <br>
actually receive such a wage sounds like something out of Monty Python.  <br>
If the factory doesn't have the money it can't pay the wages regardless of <br>
the vote. End of story.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I don't think the consumers will vote for cheaper products                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;if they realize that the workers can't afford to feed                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;themselves as a result.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
You are acting like it's obvious that the more a factory charges for its <br>
product the more money the factory will make and so the more it can pay its <br>
workers. You are acting like there is a simple relationship between the price <br>
of an object and the total amount of money made by the manufacturer.  <br>
You are profoundly wrong.   <br>
                   <br>
What price of a product would maximize profits and thus benefit the workers <br>
the most? I haven't the slightest idea. The ideal price is determined by <br>
trillions of factors interacting in hideously complex ways, the human mind is <br>
far too puny a device to figure it out from first principles, the idea that <br>
you could obtain this enormously valuable information from an election, the  <br>
same process that placed our current crop of Bozos in power, is utterly  <br>
ridiculous. Fortunately we don't need to calculate it, the market will <br>
quickly  let us know if we are very far from that ideal price.<br>
