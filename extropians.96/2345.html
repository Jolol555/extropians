<i>&gt;       For example, former Los Angeles</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Police Chief Daryl Gates, who founded the anti-drug</i><br>
<i>&gt;        program D.A.R.E., which is taught in schools across</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the nation, stated in September of 1990 that "Casual</i><br>
<i>&gt;        drug users ought to be taken out and shot." [4]</i><br>
<p>
My 5th grade daughter is being subjected to the idiotic D.A.R.E. program.<br>
Actually, this inane program barely makes any distinction between tobacco,<br>
alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,and prescription drugs.  There are no<br>
differences in strength, affect, or purpose.  But what is truly amazing is<br>
that D.A.R.E. talks to children who live in relatively peaceful<br>
middle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods as if they lived in the<br>
most crime-ridden ghetto.  Every Monday, my daughter "works through"<br>
problems like deciding whether or not to take her dad's handgun to school<br>
to blow away a classmate.  (Never mind that handgun ownership is illegal in<br>
our town.)<br>
<p>
No Ian, "Dude" Ira doesn't accept everything the government says. &lt;g&gt;<br>
(Actually, very little.)<br>
