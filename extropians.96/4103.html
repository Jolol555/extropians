Michael Bowling asked, "What I ask of you hyper-productive transhumans out <br>
there is for some insight as to how other people maximize their activity/time <br>
density."<br>
<p>
There are several approaches I have found helpful in accomplishing *A LOT* in <br>
a short amount of time.  <br>
<p>
The first is learning how to switch from one thing to another almost <br>
instantly.  This is very useful when multi-tasking, doing several things <br>
simultaneously, switching between them fluidly and advancing each task a <br>
little further and then switching to another one (I had to do a lot of this <br>
when I worked at Kinko's.  Whenever I had to wait more than a couple seconds <br>
for a machine to finish part of one task, I would advance another task and <br>
then switch back to the other ones I was working on and advance them a little <br>
further, and so on).  Many of the tasks that I do are purely mental, and I am <br>
often switching between threads of thought, picking up right where I left off <br>
and advancing that thread a little further and then leaving it when another <br>
one seems more interesting.  I probably have thousands of threads of thought <br>
open currently, and as I keep jumping around, I am advancing them all, <br>
somewhat simultaneously.<br>
<p>
The next thing that I have found helpful is to keep my priorities clear, in my <br>
awareness.  I have so many thousands of goals, and I can't do them all right <br>
now, so I have trained myself (and am continuing to train myself) to remain <br>
aware of how much I value each goal in comparison to other ones, considering <br>
my immediate situation, and to consistently do that which I value the most <br>
during the current moment.  My values for goals is continually shifting, but I <br>
am making it a habit to always do what I feel most like doing during any <br>
moment, and this seems to lead to the fulfillment of my most desired goals <br>
over time.  My training is basically to be more sensitive to what I feel most <br>
like doing and to evaluate that course of action rationally and see if I still <br>
feel like doing it, and if I do feel most like doing something, then I will do <br>
it.  I think that my feeling of what I most want to do is a result of some <br>
sort of complex, mostly unconscious, evaluation process, where my various <br>
goals are weighted against each other and the one which has the highest weight <br>
is the one I most feel like doing.<br>
<p>
Another thing I have found helpful in accomplishing much in a short period of <br>
time (it's related to switching from thing to thing easily) is learning to <br>
have my thread of thinking digress as much as possible while still following <br>
the main thought through.  Every thought has a lot of associations, links to <br>
other thoughts, and as I'm following a thread of thinking, I like to briefly <br>
look at all the associated thoughts, generally only following them for one or <br>
two links and if anything looks interesting, I add it to my stack of thoughts <br>
to follow up on later.  Then I jump back to the main thread of thoughts that <br>
I'm wanting to follow (that's the hard part -- keeping track of the main <br>
thread to follow).  Doing this helps me come up with lots of creative thoughts <br>
all the time, while still completing whatever task I'm working on.  With <br>
practice, this ability becomes automatic, and in the course of my daily <br>
activities I come up with all kinds of creative ideas and breakthroughs while <br>
remaining sufficiently focused to efficiently complete my tasks efficiently.  <br>
Most of my tasks don't require my full attention, and I train myself to use <br>
whatever extra attention I have to work on the many mental tasks I've always <br>
got running in my mind.  For example, if I'm walking across the room to get <br>
something, I can do that pretty automatically, and during the few seconds it <br>
takes to get to where I'm going, I can advance several math problems I'm <br>
working on or study the wood grain of the floor, or work on sharpening my <br>
visual acuity by trying to see more detail in the room, or I can work on <br>
moving more gracefully and consciously, or I can briefly consider what I want <br>
to cook for lunch, or many other things.<br>
<p>
Simply learning to complete tasks efficiently helps me to accomplish more in a <br>
given amount of time.  This requires being able to think a few steps ahead in <br>
the task that I am engaged in, so that I can prepare myself to complete all <br>
those steps fluidly and quickly, doing each step immediately after the <br>
previous one, with no pause between them.  It basically involves maintaining a <br>
mental plan of one's course of action, clear enough that it can be followed <br>
without hesitation. I am far from being as efficient as I would like to be in <br>
most areas, but I am working on it, and it constantly amazes me how quickly I <br>
am able to do things when I cut out all the wasted time in between steps.<br>
<p>
I hope my ideas are helpful to you in getting more out of your time.  I know <br>
they help me considerably.<br>
