<p>
Does anyone really, ...or doesn't everyone ?<br>
<p>
Do you have plants in your house ? Are you not taking away their right to<br>
have a chance to grow out in the open and reproduce, the chance to flourish<br>
unlimited by the boundries of the little pot you keep them in ? <br>
<p>
So what did you do to 'pay' back your computer today, for having it serve<br>
your 'entertainment' and other purposes ?  Or is a computer not 'conscious'<br>
yet ? Or is it the fact that we have created it, which makes it OK.<br>
<p>
Humanity is capable of both creation and helping other species reproduce.<br>
With that comes responsability, i agree. But just like someone suggested we<br>
should not project *ALL* Natural ethics to human society, we should not<br>
project *only* human ethics on nature. Balancing the two is relevant on both<br>
a personal and a social level. <br>
<p>
Regarding only natural ethics it is *wrong* to use animals and plants for<br>
ones entertainment, but it is perfectly ok to consume them. Regarding only<br>
human ethics you would see the opposite.  <br>
<p>
Its up to the individual to work out to what side he or she makes that<br>
balance heave a little...<br>
