&lt;&lt; Problem is, even if you posit starting with an altruistic species, if<br>
 one individual mutates to be selfish, it has a lovely reproductive<br>
 advantage.  Unless there are control or exclusion mechanisms among the<br>
 altruists. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
And, I think humans are not altruistic to begin with.  Governments and<br>
religions have tried to force altruism unsuccessfully with laws, guns, jail,<br>
damnation, and shame.  It just doesn't work with humans.  We all want what we<br>
want.  We are all "self-wanting"  call it "selfish".  What's wrong with that?<br>
 The people who say they want to help their fellow man (altruists) also want<br>
something.  They want other people to believe as they do and many times to<br>
control other people's generosity.  So they are also not true altruists<br>
either they are "selfish" too.<br>
<p>
BUT, enlightened selfishness is better than blatant selfishness:<br>
<p>
The more satisfying cooperations are not where I give and not get back<br>
(lose-win,altruism).   The most satisfying are where I WIN and the other<br>
people WIN too (win-win).  That is, I want to win but not at the expense of<br>
my customer:  Not lose-lose, not win-lose (not a zero-sum game) and not<br>
lose-win (submission/tyrant, altruism/parasite).<br>
<p>
One of the most popular sales and marketing philosophies today is the WIN-WIN<br>
of Stephen Covey in his book _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_.<br>
<p>
This is not an exploitive philosophy.  It gets repeat business and is highly<br>
profitable for all people.  It is unlike the old communist propaganda where<br>
capitalists were supposedly evil and exploiting the masses (win-lose).  BTW<br>
the communists wanted a lose-win (submission/parasite) or win-lose<br>
(master/slave).  Ether way they had control not you.  Win-win give you both<br>
control to get the best negotiated deal for both. <br>
<p>
Anarcho-syndicalism looks to me like "Anarcho-communism, communism without<br>
the state" or because communism is though of a state, more accurately:<br>
spontaneous socialism/ collectivist anarchy. AKA Libertarian-socialism. <br>
<p>
Contrast this to:  Libertarian capitalism "Anarcho-capitalism"  looks to me<br>
like capitalism without the state.  The only difference is<br>
socialism/communism forcefully prohibits people acquiring private property.<br>
 With socialism/communism a person's body is "owned" but it is "owned" by the<br>
state.  Communism assumes private property is theft from the state.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Collectivist anarchy vs. Individualist anarchy:<br>
<p>
There are two groups of Libertarians (at least to me) the Spontaneous<br>
Socialists (Collectivist anarchy) and the Laissez-Faire Capitalists<br>
(individualist anarchy).<br>
<p>
The first (socialist) group is where (I think) Rudolf Rocker, Noam Chomsky<br>
and Surech Naidu are.  I found a list of libertarian-socialists on the web.<br>
 I do not agree with this group.  I think they have the same short comings as<br>
destroyed the USSR.  Namely private property is forbidden.   All transactions<br>
are lose/win.  I can see where a very small idealistic group might survive if<br>
they expelled the "mutant" win-win and win-lose meme private property people.<br>
 This group sees capitalism as ONLY LOSE-WIN or WIN-LOSE.  They can not or do<br>
not want to see the WIN/WIN side of capitalism because it conflicts with<br>
their philosophy and could weaken their philosophy.<br>
<p>
I am of the second Libertarian group:  Laissez-Faire Capitalists<br>
(individualist anarchy).  Therefore I believe people like to work hard and<br>
get paid for it.  Win-win. . .  Something that could not happen without<br>
private property.  Unfortunately some businesses are win-lose. . . and then<br>
capitalism gets a bad name.  BUT, the saving grace of libertarian-capitalism<br>
is that you are free NOT to choose win-lose companies to do business with.<br>
That is why I feel the second group of libertarians are on safer ground.  <br>
<p>
Libertarian-capitalism/ anarcho-capitalism encourages people to work and pay<br>
(WIN-WIN) when they acquire private property. <br>
<p>
Libertarian-capitalism assumes people own their own bodies, unlike<br>
libertarian-socialism where the anarcho-society "owns" the individual's body.<br>
 Either believes in state control or state regulation of a person's body. <br>
<p>
BTW, Fascism is not capitalism.  Fascism gives the facade of private<br>
ownership but then regulates everything about the so called "private"<br>
property (even controls your body) so you _really_don't_ own it.<br>
