Anders Sandberg:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How much of computer manufacture is still done in sweatshops? </i><br>
<p>
The answer may depend on your definition of a sweatshop.  Some <br>
computer chips are manufactured in Asian and Eastern countries <br>
utilizing human labor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have theimpression that they being manufactured more and more using automation</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which of course would be seen as promoting unemployment in the third</i><br>
<i>&gt;world). </i><br>
<p>
Under Sale's analysis, fully automating a plant is bad, as this <br>
renders humans redundant.  Using human labor in a plant is bad, as it <br>
renders humans automatons and cogs in a larger machine.  You can't <br>
win here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; some real risks to health and bodily function are connected to their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; operation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which of course is true for every single device invented - from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;fire and millstone to the Internet. </i><br>
<p>
I suppose repetetive stress injuries become more acceptable when <br>
inflicted by hand plows or spinning machines.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He completely ignores/misrepresents who really designed</i><br>
<i>&gt;the computers people use (or more importantly, who designed the *way* they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are used) </i><br>
<p>
When one is addressing a group that feels powerless, it is easier to <br>
design a target for their anger that is immediately accessible and <br>
inanimate.  Sales took a sledgehammer to a computer terminal on <br>
television one night to prove his point.  I'm sure it made him feel <br>
better, but did nothing to address the very real problems that <br>
certain segments of the labor force are facing today.<br>
<p>
The shallowness of this approach is all the more disappointing given <br>
the sound historical treatment of the early Luddite movement in <br>
Sale's book _Rebels From the Future_, in which he draws certain <br>
lessons that could be applied to present and future development.  And <br>
yet, in the last few chapters and in later interviews he seems to <br>
indicate that we have no capacity to learn from our history.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Kevin Kelly would say he</i><br>
<i>&gt;is thinking in terms of industrial society, where control is paramount,</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than in terms of network society, where communication is central). </i><br>
<p>
Kelly and Sales go a few rounds in an interview posted at <br>
