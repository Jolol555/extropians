I recall reading, not too long ago, Science News most likely, something<br>
about how measurements of people given some sort of imaging tasks showed<br>
the same type of activity in the *retinal* processing areas as would<br>
have occurred if the subject was actually viewing a real scene.  In<br>
other words, there was some sort of feedback or projection from the<br>
visual cortex *out to* the retinal areas, the opposite of the normal<br>
stream of signals.<br>
