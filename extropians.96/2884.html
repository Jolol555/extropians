There is a difference between be willing and being able.  The White House<br>
may be willing to cover up anything ...but can they cast a spell on<br>
hundreds of investigators?  Are there no political rivalries within the<br>
U.S. government to get in their way?  If things are so monolithic, why<br>
doesn't Clinton just declare himself Emperor For Life?<br>

<p>
You are right about naval vessels.  My experience with the U.S. Military,<br>
however, is somewhat different.<br>
<p>
And, I see other revelations coming out of the military almost daily.  If<br>
people are willing to circumvent the system to reveal sex scandels, I would<br>
think some would do the same for mass murder.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;US military personnel are not your regular government employees.</i><br>
<p>
That's true, but we are talking about the military *plus* other government<br>
agencies.  I am hardly convinced that Bill Clinton loves, respects, and<br>
would protect the U.S. military.  In fact, I can see a motivation for<br>
Clinton to nail the military.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb</i><br>
<i>&gt;traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for</i><br>
<i>&gt;shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no</i><br>
<i>&gt;where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane</i><br>
<i>&gt;experienced. What is left?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The fact that it is Navy vessels collecting the debris is like letting a</i><br>
<i>&gt;crime suspect examine and collect the evidence at a crime scene.</i><br>
<p>
That could be.  But it contradicts your theory that only a small part of<br>
the destroyer crew ever knew.  This would mean several ships are now in on<br>
it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; ***Skeptics will trust those who are retrieving and examining the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; physical evidence before they trust those who insist they already know what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "really happened" because they have pieced it together from select media</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reports.***</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Skeptics of what?</i><br>
<p>
Skeptics are people who demand truth and proof.  That's your definition --<br>
and I agree with it.<br>
<p>
The issue here isn't whether you are skeptical and I am not.  To me, the<br>
issue is that some people are suggesting that since the government<br>
sometimes lies (which it does), it always lies (which it does not).<br>
<p>
I don't say you are wrong to doubt the official investigation, I say I am<br>
also not wrong to doubt the conspiracy theories.  The fact is, the<br>
conspiracy theories are based on selective reading of what are at bottom<br>
just more press reports.<br>
<p>
So it comes down to what we know and don't know.  We know 100+ people<br>
believe they saw a missile.  We know eyewitnesses at night can be<br>
unreliable.  However, even if we decide they really did see a missile --<br>
which I do not consider unreasonable -- I have heard no "facts" that prove<br>
it was fired by a US Navy ship.<br>
<p>
You can't argue *both* that the US Navy can keep anything quiet they want<br>
*and* that you or others know it was the Navy -- unless there is objective<br>
proof like photographs of the ship firing the missile, US Navy missile<br>
debris washed ashore, or whatever.  Otherwise, how did you find out what<br>
they are so good at concealing?<br>
<p>
I recognize the US Navy missile theory is in many ways more attractive and<br>
exciting.  Arguments like "here's what really happened" and "you are being<br>
lied to" and "we know the true story because we have pieced it together"<br>
are not based in fact, however.<br>
<p>
We know that terrorists have been targeting US passenger planes.  We know<br>
there have been some Islamic fundamentalists arrested and convicted in the<br>
New York City area who have vowed to take revenge.  So I lean towards the<br>
terrorist theory.<br>
<p>
But I am not mad at anyone for leaning in other directions.  For me, this<br>
isn't about which theory wins or loses, this is about finding out what<br>
really happened.<br>
