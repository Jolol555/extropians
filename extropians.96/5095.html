I haven't seen that name since... last night. I was watching an<br>
old rerun of The X-Files (first season) which prominently featured<br>
a fictional AI corporation named Eurisko.<br>

Though AM was pretty impressive for its time, I think further <br>
investigation by grad students trying to reproduce Lenat's results<br>
showed that the "new" theorems it produced were actually latent<br>
in the heuristics that Lenat seeded the system with. Something like<br>
"look for patterns when you divide integers by each other", then<br>
presto, AM "discovers" prime numbers. <br>
