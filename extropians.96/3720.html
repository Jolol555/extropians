DELURK/INTRO<br>
-------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Some of you may recognize my name from the Brain Tennis <br>
exchange HotWired in August. I think it would be fair to<br>
say, that all things considered, the extropian side <br>
more than held its own - it rocked.      <br>
<p>
I might as well say where I'm going from.  Some of my current <br>
interests would include:  Physics, Cosmology. Philosophy (Objectivist<br>
premises/morality,  Evolutionary/Popperian epistemology). Mathematics.<br>
Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Complex/Chaotic Systems.<br>
Molecular Nanotechnology.  Free Market Economics. Jazz Fusion.  Art by M.C.<br>
Escher. <br>
Architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright. History of Science &amp; Technology.<br>
3D-modelling, computer graphics, VRML, Java, Web development, crytography,<br>
cryptoanarchy, electronics. Science Fiction (Faves include Vinge,  Zindell,<br>
RA Wilson, Heinlein, Poul Anderson, Greg Benford, Frank Herbert, Phillip  K.<br>
Dyck), some cyberpunk (Sterling  and Stephenson). <br>
 I guess the scary part is the fact that I was pretty into most of this<br>
stuff before I first read about Extropians in Wired 2.10, although the idea<br>
of tying it all together with an optimistic,<br>
future-minded, rational philosophy was new and compelling, as were some<br>
ideas I weren't yet familiar with, such as The Singularity, uploading,<br>
cryptoanarchy, and mature nanotech. <br>
<p>
Some will wonder why this my first post on the list for<br>
someone who has followed extropianism for the last two years.<br>
I find myself in a bit of quandary.  Since I find myself<br>
in agreement with the fundamental premises of Extropianism,<br>
I can't help but be in general accord with most of what is  <br>
said on the list.  To improve significantly on any of it<br>
would take rather a lot of thought.  But original thought of course<br>
takes time - I want to live Extropianism and not just<br>
talk about it, so I've chosen to push on with my own studies and projects.  <br>
<p>
Currently, I have various essays relevant to extropians<br>
at various stages of completion that I hope to finish up<br>
by the new year for putting on a web page I'm preparing.<br>
(I'm also working on a small molecular modelling program<br>
that might be useful for the design of "nanowidgets")<br>
<p>
In any event, that's my introduction. You'll probably hear<br>
a lot more from me down the road; for now I've posted a couple<br>
more messages dealing with some more specific topics.<br>
