I have personal experience with the Franklin System which is similar to<br>
the Day-Timer system that Hal described. It is essentially a ring binder<br>
based daily calendar with a "to do" list, an appointment schedule and a<br>
place for notes. The key is using it EVERY day. The idea is very simple:<br>
take time every day to plan your activities for that day. That is, sit<br>
down at your desk for 10-15 minutes of "planning and solitude." This<br>
needs to become a ritual that you follow faithfully. Make the time and do<br>
it in peace. This stes up your day so it pays to be careful about it/ <br>
<p>
<p>
During the ritual you review what you did yesterday by seeing what was<br>
checked off the to-do list. Whatever wasn't checked off you recopy by<br>
hand to today (or to a day in the future). The rewriting of the list is<br>
important psychologically (at least to me). After rewriting something<br>
often enough I get so annoyed that I do the task just to get it off the<br>
list. Obviously this could be captured in software but it would be far<br>
too easy to push things forward.  <br>
<p>
<p>
After rewriting the list you assign each item to 1 of 3 categories: <br>
<p>
&lt;paraindent&gt;&lt;param&gt;left&lt;/param&gt;A - urgent and important<br>
<p>
B - urgent <br>
<p>
C - important<br>
<p>
&lt;/paraindent&gt;Then numerically prioritize the A's, B's and C's. Over time<br>
tasks will be deleted and added accordingly. Ideally you do all the A's<br>
in order, then the B's then the C's - unfortunately life gets in the way.<br>
And I've NEVER finished my entire list for a day. :-)<br>
<p>
<p>
I carry this thing around all day and review it when I'm not sure what to<br>
do next. It is my calendar, to-do list, address book, business card<br>
holder, notepad etc. <br>
<p>
<p>
It is a decidedly low-tech "system" with all the associated advantages:<br>
no power source needed, can be dropped from a great height and still<br>
work, never has a head crash or a GPF. Admittedly I can't sort it like my<br>
email, but I rarely wish I could.<br>
<p>
<p>
I got it when I joined a company where nearly everyone had one. I was<br>
using my own spiral notebook but over time I had to admit that those who<br>
used their planners at least seemed to accomplish more in the same amount<br>
of time. These were very bright people; I figured I could create my own<br>
system or appropriate theirs. Rather than re-invent the wheel I bought a<br>
planner.<br>
<p>
<p>
Franklin also has books and tapes which I read/listened to years ago when<br>
I first got the thing. Several ideas (memes?) I remember:<br>
<p>
&lt;paraindent&gt;&lt;param&gt;left&lt;/param&gt;"Plan your work then work the plan."<br>
<p>
"Set goals and prioritize the steps to get there."<br>
<p>
"The successful time-manager is willing to do what the unsuccessful<br>
time-manager is unwilling to do."<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;/paraindent&gt;These are aphorisms that can be trite or profound depending<br>
on your attitude.<br>
<p>
<p>
That last one is interesting because its subtext points out that we are<br>
in control of what we do (or don't) accomplish. You can replace<br>
time-manager with anything and it is still true.<br>
<p>
<p>
Like any tool, if used properly it will enable you to become more<br>
efficient. What you do with the extra time is up to you.<br>
