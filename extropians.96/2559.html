Gee, how old are you? You are quite the cynic.<br>

I have NEVER been to a government run facility where I was communicated<br>
with in a freindly manner, or treated in any way like I was a human<br>
being. Unfortunately, I cannot take my government business elsewhere, as<br>
they currently enforce their monopoly quite strictly (i.e. Waco, Ruby<br>
RIdge, Justus Township), so they are not motivated to act any<br>
differently. I can however go into any type of business I choose for the<br>
products or services I need, and if I don't like even the smallest bit<br>
of  my experience there, I can walk out any time I want to. I also grew<br>
up in a small town, of less than 10,000 people. However I grew up when<br>
people in this town still felt they had to be civil to each other, this<br>
is slowly not becoming the case, as people from states and cities where<br>
they have let governments have overrun their lives are moving here, and<br>
are bringing the same cancer with them. I guess the 90's haven't gotten<br>
to New Zealand yet.<br>
