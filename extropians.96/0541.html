<i>&gt; &gt;NOTE: "Life force" is my metaphor, please feel free to customize it </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;critical ratio betwean order and chaos in A-life experiments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The life force is all that I can recognize to be at the center of </i><br>

<i>&gt; Excellent point.  In this case, the sum is greater than the whole of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; parts.  Although we know that conciousness is 'merely' made up of many</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemicals and substances, something must be said for every concious move we</i><br>
<i>&gt; make.  The fact that I know that I am I and not a just a bunch of chemicals</i><br>
<i>&gt; proves that in this case, the sum is greater.  1010010101101001010101?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Frankly, I know that I am more than that.</i><br>
<p>
Consciousness is made of chemicals and substances the same way that a <br>
painting is made of paint.  The paint is important, but the careful <br>
distribution of the paint makes a great painting.  You will be more <br>
than 101010101010001001 if it is arranged in a life giving way.<br>
