This can be true, but I wouldn't say it is the reason why an engineer would<br>
be an artist if only for aesthetic sake.  We were referring to utilizing the<br>
ability to think and imagine.<br>

<p>
Again, "elegant" is a dressing, but not the thought behind a construction of<br>
idea or product. <br>

<p>
Only if your intent is to separate art from engineering.  I doubt that<br>
artists who produce their work throught their engineering capabilities would<br>
find this separation accurate.<br>
