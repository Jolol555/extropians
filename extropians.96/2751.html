I wrote (on 31 Oct):<br>
<i>&gt;I will present a paper of mine which has a model which explains why</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational regulators would ban products for rational consumers, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than to label them.  I explain such behavior as a commitment failure;</i><br>
<i>&gt;both sides would rather commit to no such bans, but once bans are</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible, regulators often choose them in the game-theoretic</i><br>
<i>&gt;equilibrium, since not banning would be taken as an endorsement of</i><br>
<i>&gt;product quality.</i><br>
<p>
"Peter C. McCluskey" responded (on 3 Nov):<br>
<i>&gt;Why are you trying to argue that regulators would rather avoid such</i><br>
<i>&gt;bans? My impression is that most people find it hard to hold beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt;that their work is harming people, and that it is much easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt;assume that regulatory agencies attract mainly those workers who</i><br>
<i>&gt;are inclined to believe that such bans are good.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry to take so long to respond.  I've been sick with shingles.<br>
<p>
Yes, if we just assume different people have different beliefs, we<br>
expect those who think its a good idea to tend to be in govt more.<br>
But why should there be such a variation in beliefs?  My model<br>
predicts that most everyone would do as they do in their<br>
circumstances.  <br>
<p>
Consider the analogy of explaining war.  Some people think there is a<br>
variation in beliefs about whether war is good, and those nutzos who<br>
think war is good are more likely to be soldiers, and soldiers decide<br>
if we have wars.  I don't consider this a very good theory of war.<br>
I'd rather think in terms of strategic games with asymmetric info.<br>
