<i>&gt;&gt;I agree that it would be beneficial to have brain power aligned with </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;activity (it tends to naturally do so).  I`ve always admired the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;social structure of ants and termites: no real central authority, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;each member of the work force physically/mentally tailored to it`s </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;function.  There is no reason why drones won`t be happy doing doing </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;there work.  I`m quite happy studying computer science, and don`t </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;feel bad or any less happy that I`m not studying quantum physics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact we can make them all happy and euphoric while they complete their</i><br>
<i>&gt;tasks by flooding their brains with endorphins while they work.</i><br>

        This sounds remarkably like Aldous Huxley's groundbreaking book<br>
"Brave New World".  It was in this book that the idea of having a<br>
non-reproducing society came into light.  The book featured a society born<br>
in bottles.  There were different classes of these 'bottle-babies' ranging<br>
from extremely smart (Alpha-plus) to drones (Gammas).  Though the book was<br>
fictional, the ideas Huxley expressed are still plausible today.  I have<br>
given the subject of drones a lot of thought since I read this book, and<br>
even more since the subject came up on this ML.<br>
        I personally think that this is a form of control.  Even though the<br>
'drones' are created with a low intelligence quotient, they are still<br>
*alive*.  How about this scenario:  If a race with an average IQ of 250 came<br>
to be, and they decided to use people with an average IQ of 100 as their<br>
drones, the people with the IQ of 100 would not care for it too much.<br>
Even if the ones with IQ of 250 were far superior in intelligence, us IQ<br>
100's would be unhappy.  If they were to flood our brains with endorphins,<br>
that takes away all that is sacred or real to us.<br>
        Whether it is a 'stupid' form of life, or a superior form of life,<br>
it still has sentience.  Who are we to put a control on someone's life?<br>
Undrugged, the drones would have some sort of conciousness -even if it is on<br>
a much smaller scale to ours.  I love my life, I think they should have the<br>
chance to love theirs.<br>
