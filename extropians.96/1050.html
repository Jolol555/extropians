<i>&gt;Didn't the Manhattan project adopt a similar attitude? I seem to remember</i><br>
<i>&gt;reading that they calculated the probability of the first nuclear explosion</i><br>
<i>&gt;causing a chain reaction which would destroy the entire atmosphere. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;result was non-negligible, but they went ahead anyway. (Of course, the story</i><br>
<i>&gt;I read could have found exaggeration through the ethics of its writer.)</i><br>
I've read that myself and I believe there was some sea show on TV like<br>
SeaQuest long ago which storyline was based on that they were forced to live<br>
underwater because they fried the atmosphere.<br>
