In my junior year of high school there was a kid with genetic respiratory<br>
problems and he began to choke on his own fluid. I did the heimleck on him<br>
and saved his life. Now a few years later I have this icky feeling as<br>
though I've cheated evolution and allowed bad genes to continue when I know<br>
that it was still a noble thing to do by moral standards. Am I infected<br>
with some sort of "100% natural" meme?<br>
