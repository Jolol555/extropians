Hmmm.  I don't see the difference between "rational emotions" amd my<br>
preferred notion of emotions tamed by reason.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;Your response seems to be an emotional reaction to Russell's quote:  A</i><br>

<p>
<p>
Ha, ha.  And I suppose if I insist we must agree A =82 A is false to hold a<br>
rational discussion, you would call my insistence "an emotional reaction."<br>
<p>
<p>
(OK, I admit I am something of a slave to sarcasm &lt;g&gt;)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your reasoning,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that Russell's statement is foolish, is _correct_ in so far as it goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;(using your understanding that emotions are too often irrational); BUT,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's probably not _consistent_ with Russell's context - Russell was</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably using 'emotion' to refer to 'good' emotions, like loyalty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;charity, love and the aspects that QueeneMuse mentions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;with emotion you can create. You can generate. You can luminate. With</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotions you can fulfill and enrichen. You can move and you can soar.</i><br>
<i>&gt;[snip] In a well balanced, non reactive type B person, most emotions are</i><br>
<i>&gt;useful ... If emotions have a bad rap in the world, it is precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;because people think they are at the mercy of them.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
=46irst, while I agree that statements may be misinterpreted out-of-context,<br>
we have to be careful about invoking such claims.  E.g., argue with a bible<br>
student and watch everything flip back-and-forth between literal (stands by<br>
itself) and figurative (requires context).  Admittedly, I haven't checked<br>
the context of Russell's comment, but it is structured like an aphorism, so<br>
I shouldn't have to.<br>
<p>
If we are wise, we choose who we love and who we are loyal to.  Emotion<br>
might tell use who seems like a good candidate, but great literature is<br>
largely about how we are so easily and often mislead.  Still, if love is<br>
made slave to reason and understanding, it can be a very good thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;This could be just as one-sided as B. Russell's 'reason slaved to</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotion'.  Emotions can also effectively constrain reason (in warning</i><br>
<i>&gt;you what it is worthwhile to apply your logic to) and inspire</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding.  This sounds more like what QueeneMuse and Steve W. were</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting at.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I've never suggested you can derive inspiration from logic alone.  And I<br>
agree logic must be applied *to* something.  Perhaps I should say emotion<br>
must be ruled by reason, understanding, and knowledge.  But I clearly don't<br>
want to "emote" loyalty to someone and then apply logic and understanding<br>
to better serve them; I want to use logic and understanding to first<br>
determine who deserves my loyalty.  In other words, my loyalty is<br>
*controlled* by these higher functions.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;As Natasha Vita More added:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think</i><br>
<i>&gt;of exercising the management of emotions.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sounds like she agrees with me.  &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
Seriously, I am not saying we should put away our emotions, just take<br>
control of them.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;My point is that value-free logic doesn't exist.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Lots of things are not value-free, but logic (strictly-defined) is.  For<br>
example, A =3D A is not contingent upon your or my values.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;That quote from Bertrand Russell is so startling and powerful because it</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes from a mathematical genius, someone who knew as much about logic</i><br>
<i>&gt;as anyone in human history, and yet had a rather difficult time</i><br>
<i>&gt;harnessing the emotions in his own personal life. (This from a Wall St.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Journal review of a Russell biography that I saw within the last few</i><br>
<i>&gt;months.)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Hmmm.  He said logic should be slave to emotions, and he had a hard time<br>
harnessing his own emotions.  Isn't there a pattern here?<br>
