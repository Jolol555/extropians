Possibly the only disadvantage of strong cryptography is that it will make<br>
"plain old detective work" cheaper than breaking your encrypted<br>
messages... <br>

<p>
But that's not what you're trying to do. The strongly encrypted data would<br>
be *superencrypted* with the RNG output. So you're not even looking for<br>
data from a different sequence, but encrypted data that has been XOR-ed<br>
with the RNG output. That's an even harder task. I don't think that you<br>
can do it without cracking the RNG, otherwise you'll get false positives<br>
from compressed data. <br>

Well, let's try a thought-experiment... Suppose you convert every atom of<br>
the Earth into DNA (converting iron into other elements as appropriate)<br>
and use it as a DNA computer (the fastest method anyone I know has<br>
suggested to crack conventional ciphers), and that a DNA structure of<br>
1,000,000 atoms can try ten possible keys or RNG seeds every nanosecond.<br>
If my rough calculations are correct, your DNA computer will only take<br>
about 10^32 years to break a 3-key triple-DES message or determine the<br>
seed of a strong 192-bit PRNG. <br>
<p>
However, if we were only using 64-bit PRNGs and changing the key once per<br>
second then with those parameters you'd potentially need only 1.5 kg of<br>
DNA to read all Internet traffic (of course the real amount would be<br>
rather larger but not impossible), so you may be correct for weak PRNGs --<br>
that would include ordinary 56-bit DES. Ouch. <br>

<p>
I disagree. It's more like everyone paints their windows black to keep<br>
their business private, but some people also have a further layer of<br>
opaque and bulletproof windows inside just in case someone breaks the<br>
outer windows. <br>
