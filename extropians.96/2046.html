On Wednesday, October 09, 1996 3:40PM, I wrote:<br>
&lt;has the following been discussed on the list ... the  little-known<br>
Spacetime Reductive Materialism (SRM) theories of consciousness proposed<br>
by California PolyTechnic professor James Culbertson [discussed in Nick<br>
Herbert's 11/94 book _Elemental Mind: Human Consciousness and the New<br>
Physics_ &gt;<br>

On Sunday, October 13, 1996 2:35AM, Hara Ra replied:<br>
&lt;Not that I know of. Nick is an acquaintance of mine, and I've never<br>
heard him discuss this (but neither were the circumstances appropriate).<br>
Would you kindly provide a summary of this POV?&gt;<br>
<p>
I'll try, though it will be difficult to do without diagrams &amp; flow<br>
charts.  Also, this is all second-hand (what you see in quotes below<br>
will be from Herbert's book).  I would really recommend Nick Herbert's<br>
book to anyone interested in the mind.  Herbert favors dualistic<br>
approaches BUT he also provides one of the most comprehensive and easily<br>
read discussions of the most cutting-edge theories of mind that I've<br>
seen; and, _Elemental Mind_ is still available in most good-size U.S.<br>
bookstores.<br>
<p>
PREFACE:<br>
This thread started with Hara Ra's mention of David Chalmer's recent<br>
book _The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory_, 1996 from<br>
Oxford University Press. Like Chalmers, Nick Herbert starts with the<br>
assumption that "The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem<br>
of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of<br>
information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect."<br>
(Chalmers).  Culbertson attempts to provide a physics-based approach to<br>
modeling human experience and consciousness.<br>
<p>
INTRO:<br>
James Culbertson (JC) has worked on theories of robot &amp; human<br>
intelligence since the early 1950's when he was at the RAND Corporation.<br>
In 1953, Culbertson left RAND for California Polytechnic in San Luis<br>
Obispo, where he taught mathematics and computer science and even headed<br>
the philosophy department.  Most of what Nick Herbert (NH) describes<br>
comes from Culbertson's 1976 book _Sensations, Memories, and the Flow of<br>
Time_ (which is available from Amazon as a special order).<br>
<p>
SPACETIME REDUCTIVE MATERIALISM (SRM):<br>
"Einstein's spacetime model of external physical reality serves as<br>
Culbertson's framework for describing internal psychological reality.<br>
'Reductive', instead of 'emergent', because Culbertson believes ... that<br>
consciousness permeates all of nature ... And finally 'materialism', not<br>
'idealism', because ... mind is completely accounted for by movements of<br>
matter.... Although all matter is sentient to some degree, most of this<br>
awareness is of very low quality and is not functionally coupled into<br>
matter's behavior in any important way." (p120)  JC views the world "not<br>
as unconnected particles in space but as interacting world lines in<br>
Einsteinean spacetime."  NH uses this quote from physicist Herman Weyl<br>
to set the stage for JC's theories: "The objective world simply is; it<br>
does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward<br>
along the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to<br>
life as a fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time."<br>
(p121)<br>
<p>
SRM WORLDLINE DIAGRAMS:<br>
To simplify discussions, JC's models assume that "the universe consists<br>
entirely of two-body interactions".  (Feynman?) diagrams are used to<br>
represent events inside a conscious entity.  Convergent (AND) junctions<br>
happen when two events become correlated in memory and divergent (OR)<br>
junctions occur when a world line splits.  The current state of the<br>
entity is the point R at the top of the diagram. "The elementary events<br>
that spacetime point R perceives consist of certain divergent junctions<br>
in its past called terminal breaks."  All of the events leading up to R<br>
are called R's "influence tree".  When the tree is pruned at the<br>
terminal breaks, we have what is called R's "outlook tree".  "The<br>
intensity of R's experience is measured by the number of terminal breaks<br>
in R's outlook tree ... qualitative differences result from the<br>
different ways in which terminal breaks are connected via the outlook<br>
tree to the perceiving vantage point R."  Euler diagrams are used to<br>
visualize the organizational pattern of the outlook tree's terminal<br>
breaks.<br>
<p>
There are two types of significant loops in an influence tree:<br>
disjunctions that later re-converge are called ZAGs; and, _clear loops_<br>
are loops which have no breaks in at least one of their paths.  The<br>
breaks in clear loops are called ZIGs, and are never experienced.  NH is<br>
mostly interested in these 'clear loops' because, as he says, "The<br>
perceptual transparency of a clear loop will, in principle, allow us to<br>
build 'mind links'" (p126).  "Culbertson's theory possesses the<br>
attractive feature that it permits experimental access to the inner<br>
experiences of other beings [through clear-loop links]." (p135)<br>
<p>
THE SPACE-TIME HARD DISK:<br>
"In SRM, a reminiscence [is] a partial re-experiencing of the event ...<br>
your present vantage point connects up via a clear-loop link to the<br>
actual moment in spacetime where that [event] is still eternally present<br>
[and] is NOT recalled from some storage space in the brain ... memories<br>
are never as clear as direct perceptions because the clear-loop link<br>
connecting the past with the present becomes degraded with time,<br>
acquiring extra breaks that make the clear link less transparent and<br>
more cluttered with other memories.... [However] unconscious memories<br>
such as muscle skills are probably stored in the brain in more<br>
conventional ways ... the unconscious data rate in the human brain is at<br>
least a trillion times larger than the conscious rate ... Coexistent<br>
with this unconscious mechanism, part of the brain acts as a sentient<br>
subsystem, an intricately woven spacetime tapestry stretching back into<br>
the past with caterpillar circuitry to simulate the flow of time and<br>
memories that are not located in the brain at all but far back in the<br>
past where/when they first happened." (p132)<br>
<p>
CONCLUSION:<br>
My previous post pointed out the evolutionary advantage of this<br>
'space-time hard disk', IF IT EXISTS!  As NH points out: "Culbertson's<br>
SRM model of mind seems to have two major problems ... [First] in the<br>
midst of such a pandemonium of awareness, why do our minds feel so<br>
unifed? ... [Second] the link between his abstract awareness algorithms<br>
and actual neural or silicon hardware remains somewhat unclear....<br>
Although it is still too abstract to be applied to actual neural nets,<br>
Culbertson's consciousness model is not a mere vague, verbal philosophy<br>
of mind but a clear-cut engineering description of the (possible) state<br>
of affairs at the mind/body interface."<br>
<p>
This assumes that there *is* a dualistic mind/body interface, rather<br>
than an integral system.  I have a hard time with this notion that<br>
"memories are not located in the brain at all".  I'm also skeptical that<br>
'clear loops' could be useful for building "mind links" between two<br>
conscious beings. It seems to me that if clear-loops are 'transparent'<br>
then neither participant would ever realize they are sharing a common<br>
experience.<br>
Still, the influence-tree, reflection point, and outlook-tree model<br>
seems like it could be a useful starting point for algorithms that<br>
simulate human memory and experience.<br>
