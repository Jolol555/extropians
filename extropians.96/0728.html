        This will be my last installment of my transhuman\extropian poetry<br>
for a little while.  You can find more examples of my work on both Anders'<br>
page and the upcoming 'transhuman art' page that Natasha V. More is putting<br>
up.  If you have any comments, criticism, questions or requests, contact me<br>
through the list or at e_shaun@uniserve.com.  <br>

<p>
LIBERTY<br>
<p>
<p>
Everything I ever wanted was lost<br>
Anything I ever needed always came at some high cost<br>
The protocol of life frowned on me for what I'd feel<br>
And the politics of freedom left no room to be real<br>
<p>
I was looking for a paradise -an oasis in my soul<br>
A refuge from emotion, liberty my goal<br>
Peace of mind, peace of heart, a piece of achieved dreams<br>
And while the world backs away in fear, I've found it -or so it seems<br>
<p>
The truth lies behind<br>
The liberty of the mind<br>
Insight paves the way<br>
To the freedom of a new day<br>
Man cannot doubt<br>
Unless he has something to believe<br>
Man has no way out<br>
Until he has something to achieve<br>
<p>
Basking in my glory, content with my need<br>
Living for myself is surely the best way to succeed<br>
Liberty enacted, freedom oh so near<br>
No more reason for protocol, nothing more to fear<br>
<p>
All I ever wanted was to be free<br>
And have my liberty<br>
<p>
The truth lies behind<br>
The liberty of the mind<br>
Insight paves the way<br>
To the freedom of a new day<br>
Man can never doubt<br>
Unless he has something to believe<br>
Man has no way out<br>
Until he has something to achieve<br>

        The following was inspired by L. Neil Smith's article on 'Unanimous<br>
Consent and the Utopian Vision'.  It is aptly named "Unanimous Consent".<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
UNANIMOUS CONSENT<br>
<p>
<p>
Wouldn't it be great<br>
To wake up one day<br>
And be able to say<br>
"Things will go my way!"<br>
<p>
Boy, that would be great!<br>
And it is a possibility<br>
If man could only see<br>
Everyone has the ability<br>
<p>
If everyone could see what they wanted to achieve<br>
If everyone did what they always had meant<br>
Though it may seem very hard to believe<br>
We can have unanimous consent<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be great<br>
To want to go far<br>
Drive a really nice car<br>
Be more than you are<br>
<p>
Boy, that would be great!<br>
To do what you want to do<br>
Have a Utopia, too<br>
For everyone and you<br>
<p>
If everyone could see what they wanted to achieve<br>
If everyone did what they always had meant<br>
Though it may seem very hard to believe<br>
We can have unanimous consent<br>
<p>
Won't it be great!<br>
When the future is here<br>
And we'll all forfeit fear<br>
For a forthcoming year!<br>
<p>
Boy, that will be great!<br>
We'll soon forget about the crime<br>
And the government pantomime<br>
<i>&gt;From this obsidian time</i><br>
<p>
If everyone could see what they wanted to achieve<br>
If everyone did what they always had meant<br>
Though it may seem very hard to believe<br>
We can have unanimous consent<br>
<p>
And it shall be done!<br>
Open mind and clean slate<br>
It will be great<br>
Just you wait!<br>
<p>
