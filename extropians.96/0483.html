Yeah.  There's just 300 megayears between rock and fossils.  It might be<br>
informative to consider what type of rocks are from then, but I can't<br>
look anything up right now.<br>

} I agree with your timeline about the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, <br>
} but I see no reason why only Eukaryotes could have caused it.<br>
<p>
Especially since eukaryotes are largely emborged prokaryotes --<br>
chloroplasts are cyanobacteria in a cushy position.  But Robin's point<br>
might have been the other way around -- eukaryotes need oxygen, and if<br>
they appear as soon as there's enough O2 in the atmosphere, well, there<br>
goes another part of the filter.  The data's overall reliability is<br>
still shaky though, I think, authoritative papers or no.  We argued<br>
about stuff like this in geology classes a bit.<br>
<p>
I forgot to mention my favorite solution to the Fermi Paradox when<br>
talking with Robin, though.  They _are_ out there.  They're being very,<br>
very quiet.  So as not to disturb us?  No.  Because they've all evolved<br>
into Sagan's passive non-expansionists?  No.<br>
<p>
Because they're scared silly (or rather, silent) of the berserkers.<br>
Even a NASA commission, I've heard, suggested that perhaps being too<br>
loud wasn't such a good idea.  I can imagine every other society<br>
reaching our stage, having the idea of Darwinism on hand, being on the<br>
brink of passing into a world state anyway (assumption, but plausible if<br>
needed), seeing the great silence and deciding that for the Safety of<br>
the Race We Will be Very Unobtrusive.  No Gain is Worth a Risk to the<br>
Species.  If they ever get bored with this stage they might have turned<br>
into advanced versions of Imperial China, which didn't care to explore<br>
the world anymore, thank you very much.  That stage does require<br>
exploration to be expensive; the first stage just requires a good police<br>
state.  So the universe is filled with pessimistic versions of Niven's<br>
State, Chinas, and Vinge's World State from "The Peddler" (although I<br>
suppose something like the Peace Authority could work.)  Paranoia is<br>
probably far more reliably universal than altruism.<br>
<p>
Now, even if you take this seriously it probably can't explain more than<br>
1 or 2 orders of magnitude.  (Especially since I'd hope for us to be the<br>
exception.)  But I love the idea.  The berserkers aren't everywhere.<br>
The berkserkers don't even exist.  The idea, though...<br>
