<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope these activities are helpful to some of you, or at least that my ways</i><br>
<i>&gt;of approaching certain types of things are helpful.  Also, if any of you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;any other good mind training activities you'd like to share, I'd be very</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested and appreciative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
David has some great ideas!!<br>
One thing I was finding is that I'm not very good at teaching or doing<br>
other cool things for groups of people if I don't feel appreciated. When<br>
that happens I sometimes decide to stop doing the cool thing, and of course<br>
I'm the one for whom that is the greatest drawback. So what I try to do so<br>
I don't run out of cool-thing receptacles is to write down the appreciation<br>
I want for myself in a little appreciation book so I don't let that silly<br>
thing stop me. It's a good stopgap to use until I become perfect. :&gt;<br>
