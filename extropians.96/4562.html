<i>&gt;&gt; True you can still have fun but can you really use doom or quake as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; source of inspiration?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, someone wrote a series of 'Doom' novels, and there are a huge number</i><br>
<i>&gt;based on the D&amp;D universe ;-). Honestly, I'm not so sure about programmed</i><br>
<i>&gt;environments like 'Doom', but I could certainly see people getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;inspiration from software which could, say, generate a new universe from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice of physical laws.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose it's all based upon user-preference but I don't think I could<br>
enjoy a virtual world as much if I knew I could easily tear it to shreds in<br>
seconds with little effort. Hey, I just thought of something! Maybe the<br>
life I'm currently living is just a uploaded environment I've created and<br>
have switched on my Programmed Ignorance switch to enjoy and experience it.<br>
Perhaps when we die, we're just exiting the program.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;[Sorry, I'm sticking to AIs because it's easier to write 8-)]</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps we should invent a new term! How about DP (digital people)? Any<br>
suggestions Anders?<br>
