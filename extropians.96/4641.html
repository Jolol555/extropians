If a Quantum Computers is ever made then the only Cryptography that would <br>
still work would be one time pads and Quantum Cryptography. One time pads <br>
were used in the first world war, but they are very hard to implement because <br>
it's difficult to distribute pads securely to everyone who needs one. Quantum<br>
Cryptography has already been used in the real world and not just in the lab, <br>
the only reason it isn't more popular is that we already have public key <br>
cryptography and nobody yet has a Quantum Computers. I should add that if a <br>
Quantum Computer is made then the world will change so fast and so radically <br>
that the fact that you can no longer use PGP safely would be the last thing <br>
you'd be worrying about.<br>
