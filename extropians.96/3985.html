<i>&gt;I'll make it simple, Hal.  Name a free society, any time, anywhere, in</i><br>

<i>&gt;correlative factor was nearly always how well  people could hold their</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaders accountable, while personal secrecy varied according to culture and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology, almost at right angles to freedom.  </i><br>
<p>
If personal secrecy can vary independently of both freedom and the<br>
accountability of leaders, then you shouldn't object to improved<br>
personal secrecy on the grounds that it will threaten our freedom.<br>
You could so object if you thought that leader accountability is<br>
negatively correlated with personal secrecy, but then these two<br>
just couldn't have correlations of near 1 and 0 with freedom.  The<br>
math just doesn't work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Scandinavians, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;instance, have high freedom, high courtesy, low nosiness... and rather low</i><br>
<i>&gt;degrees of personal secrecy.  Any citizen can look up a lot of info about</i><br>
<i>&gt;his/her neighbors.  Nudity is common, etc.  things were much the same in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the oldest democracy, Iceland.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, there were renaissances in which personal secrecy was almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;nonexistent.  The golden age of Athens featured a democracy without even</i><br>
<i>&gt;the secret ballot.  Everyone knew everyone else's dirty laundry.  It was</i><br>
<i>&gt;very imperfect, yet they were free compared to all that came before them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;... the American Revolution is the ultimate paramount example of MY</i><br>
<i>&gt;correlation!  It was a revolution about accountability.  About setting</i><br>
<i>&gt;up the world's first system in which the mighty were effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt;exposed to light and prevented from conspiring against the masses.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of the five dangerous power centers in the world today, government,</i><br>
<i>&gt;aristo-oligarchies, criminals, religions and the techno elite, you ONLY</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk about government!  The tools of secrecy you tout will help the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;four to conspire... and by human nature, they certainly will.  </i><br>
<p>
This discussion has suffered from excessive abstraction, so lets focus<br>
on concrete examples such as these, and use the most concrete terms<br>
available.  <br>
<p>
"Accountability" encompases many things.  In a democracy, it includes<br>
how often leaders are elected, who is eligible to be a leader, how<br>
severe the punishments for public disapproval are, ease of idenfitying<br>
who was responsible for any given policy, etc.  What David focuses on<br>
is one factor which can improve accountability: what I'll call<br>
"fish-bowl leaders", the ability to watch many aspects of such<br>
leader's lives.  And David is concerned about all people with power,<br>
not just government officials.<br>
<p>
Since I think most people are willing to put their political leaders<br>
in a fish-bowl, the main issue here regards non-political leaders.  So<br>
we need to ask: in familiar historical examples, how well does citizen<br>
well-being (hopefully related to "freedom") correlate with fish-bowl<br>
non-political leaders?  Did Athenian or American Revolutionary<br>
religious, aristocratic, and business leaders live in fish-bowls, for<br>
example?<br>
<p>
A central issue here is how carefully could we draw certain lines.  If<br>
we could draw a line so that leaders of all sorts had to live in<br>
fish-bowls, but the rest of us didn't, that might satisfy most sides.<br>
But if we can't draw this line, how can we be so sure we can draw<br>
lines so as to allow military leaders just enough privacy to keep<br>
military secrets, trade negoatiation leaders just enough privacy to<br>
keep negotiation strategies secret, etc?  Again the question comes<br>
down to: what are our real choices regarding privacy?<br>
