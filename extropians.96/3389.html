Actually, it hasn't been quiet at all. Since about October 1995, string<br>
theorists seem to be agreed that all five forms of string theory (bosonic, <br>
Types I, IIa, IIb, heterotic) are different limits of one underlying<br>
theory, "M-theory", which is a theory of interacting _membranes_<br>
(fundamental objects of two or more dimensions) in eleven-dimensional<br>
spacetime. <br>

As for connection to experiment, a lot of papers on string phenomenology<br>
are being written, but the theory doesn't yet have a major predictive<br>
success which it can claim as uniquely its own.<br>
