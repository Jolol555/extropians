 Open Peer Review concept for internet publication.<br>
<p>
The Open Peer Review concept uses internet technologies to alleviate<br>
problems with our current peer review system. Basically the proposed system<br>
works by publishing scientific results on the web and appending reviewer's<br>
comments to these web pages.  The process is open, meaning that (1) the<br>
reviewer's names are included with their comments and (2) any qualified<br>
scientist can review the scientific web page.  The system would be more<br>
formal than newsgroups, but would work differently from current peer<br>
reviewed journals.<br>
<p>
By making the process open, we aim to reduce the conflicts of interest<br>
which sometimes occur during peer review.  For example, very often it is a<br>
competitor who reviews a manuscript--their personal needs compete directly<br>
with the authors' right to a fair review based on scientific merit.<br>
Sometimes a reviewer rejects a manuscript but then uses concepts from the<br>
manuscript in their own work.  Under the new open system, publication of<br>
the manuscript would always proceed.  Competitors can still review the<br>
manuscript and make comments in the open format described below.<br>
<p>
We are considering adoption of this Open Peer Review System for the World<br>
Journal Club (<a href="http://www.journalclub.com/wjc1.html">http://www.journalclub.com/wjc1.html</a>).  We would appreciate<br>
any comments you have on this topic.<br>
<p>
The proposed Open Peer Review System:<br>
<p>
(1) Scientific merit is not assessed prior to publication.  Reviewer's<br>
comments are appended to the publication in a PEER REVIEW section.<br>
<p>
(2) To maintain focus, reviewer's comments are restricted to the article or<br>
related literature.<br>
<p>
(3) Reviewer's names and contact information are included with their<br>
comments.<br>
<p>
(4) Any World Journal Club member can review any World Journal Club<br>
publication.<br>
<p>
(5) Authors can respond to reviewer's comments by rebuttal or by appending<br>
new results to their publication.<br>
<p>
If you would like to publish your work under this type of system, please<br>
request an application to join the World Journal Club.  If you do not want<br>
to be part of this system, please reply and tell us why.  We want to<br>
include all competent scientists, and the Open Review System may be adapted<br>
to meet your concerns.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
David W. Bradley, Ph.D.<br>
