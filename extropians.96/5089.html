<i>&gt; &gt;Considering that I've been involved in actively working to get a number</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;to say to hell with them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good for you!  How is it going?  What would you say are the things you've</i><br>
<i>&gt; tried that work best? </i><br>
<p>
Well, my biggest, or his biggest success, was my former business<br>
partner, A... Hes now 3 years sober. He was the one I tried the most<br>
with, endured the most crap with, etc. Many of his trust fund kiddie<br>
freinds have now gotten with the "new" thing as a result.<br>
<p>
As for A.... here's things I did in this order:<br>
<p>
1) as he was originally a powder coke rave partier, I told all of his<br>
high class drug dealers that I would shoot them if they supplied<br>
anything to him. This cut things out for a while, but when things got<br>
difficult with our lighting business, he started cruising down to the<br>
Rainier Valley area of Seattle to score from the ghetto boys (any of you<br>
that know Seattle know what I'm talking about). As he was not as<br>
affluent at that point due to the difficulties with our business, he got<br>
into crack.<br>
<p>
2) I put up with it for a while, figuring that as long as the SOB kept<br>
the business supported, I wouldn't care what he did to his brain. But<br>
eventually it got so bad that I arranged an intervention. the most<br>
difficult thing was to get his mother to get involved. She put him in<br>
treatment.<br>
<p>
3) When he got out of treatment, he stated that he needed everyones<br>
support,etc... (i.e. setting up conditions to relapse and blame it on<br>
others) so I said I would not drink at all and would go to AA meetings<br>
every day with him (for 6 months).<br>
<p>
4) I think this level of support on my part, and that he met a really<br>
nice stable girl a few months later who he is now engaged to was the<br>
biggest thing to help him stay sober.<br>
<p>
I really support the intervention process, and that the more family and<br>
freinds who actively support the persons efforts for as long as possible<br>
helps ensure continuing sobriety.<br>
<p>
 Which work least well?  How well do the people<br>
<i>&gt; involved know you, and do you think your techniques would work on people</i><br>
<i>&gt; that knew you less well or not at all?</i><br>
<p>
In my case, I had never experienced anything like cocaine until I got<br>
into business with this individual and began associating with many of<br>
his upper crust associates. A small amount of pot plus the normal<br>
fraternity partying like hell in college was all I had ever seen, so the<br>
whole thing was quite an eye opener. needless to say, my early efforts<br>
didn't work, as I really didn't understand what I was dealing with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But also because of my experience, I can tell</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you that substance abuse is merely a symptom of other problems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;typically having to do with childhood trauma.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mostly I'm suggesting that framing them as "screwed up", as in</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If they weren't screwed up to begin with,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;substance abuse would not be a problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; may be an obstacle to what you're trying to do.  In my experience,</i><br>
<i>&gt; people detect such attitudes and get defensive.  Note that I ascribe</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the idea that our language affects our thoughts (and vice-versa);</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose it's one of the reasons I'm not big on sarcasm.</i><br>
<p>
One of the big things both I an he learned were that you must<br>
acknowledge how screwed up you are. We all are screwed up. Thinking<br>
you're a titan and invincible is just a trip to insanity.<br>
<p>
I think the biggest thing I like about transhumanism, and why I no<br>
longer care so much for the continual "I'm a piece of shit, and there's<br>
nothing I can do about it" mentality of many AA people is the hope for<br>
actual improvment in the average human condition, and that such<br>
improvement takes the actual efforts of us as individuals.<br>
