Here are some observations and ideas I have had regarding macro human<br>
behavior and its relevance to extropian transhumanism:<br>
<p>
Whenever I am around a crowd, I like to observe its behavior and motions.  I<br>
don't observe individual people, but the crowd as a single unit.  One thing<br>
that has always struck me about crowds is that if evaluated as a single<br>
unit, it behaves almost identically to a simple organism, like a protozoan.<br>
Most of the behaviors have direct analogs to the pondwater world.  This has<br>
led me to a couple thoughts regarding the human mind and society.<br>
<p>
1)  Despite that every human is an intelligent, sentient being, much of our<br>
behavior appears to stem from the oldest parts of our DNA.  In spite of our<br>
evolutionary advancement, our net behavior is more or less identical to that<br>
of the oldest organisms.  <br>
<p>
2)  If the net behavior of humanity is really that basic and simple, then it<br>
should be possible to predict with great accuracy the reaction of the human<br>
population under a given set of conditions and circumstances.  Given a good<br>
enough model of macroscopic behavior, one should be able to predict with a<br>
high level of certainty the organization of the future world, and outcomes<br>
in the present one.  A "perfect" model remains to be created however.<br>
<p>
3)  Technology has not had any significant net impact on behavior.  The<br>
advance of technology has not yet allowed people to overcome our behavioral<br>
DNA, only mask it.<br>
<p>
<p>
One thing that kind of bugs me about this is that I have a suspicion that a<br>
group of the most dedicated extropian transhumanist would behave the same as<br>
the rest of humanity if evaluated as a group via hidden observation.  I<br>
realize that it is not easy overcoming millions of years of evolution, but<br>
at some level, I think we are fooling ourselves into thinking that we are<br>
progressing beyond our basic biological imperatives.  If evaluated from afar<br>
as a group, I have a suspicion that Extropians would appear to behave with<br>
the same net imperatives as everyone else, even if on an individual level<br>
there were some differences.<br>
<p>
We may have reached a point where evolution is hindering, rather than<br>
helping, the development of transhumans.  The fact that we don't notice that<br>
we are following these behaviors indicates how fundamental they are.  The<br>
timescales we are using for the evolution of transhumans is too small for<br>
evolutionary development.  While our DNA may be appropriate for modern<br>
humans, it is not appropriate for transhumans, and the influence is<br>
observable in a larger context, no matter how well extropian transhumanists<br>
hide it as individuals.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is impossible for humans in our current state to achieve<br>
extropian transhumanism.  Maybe attempts at transcending beyond our current<br>
selves is nothing more than superficial; a candy coating on old DNA.<br>
