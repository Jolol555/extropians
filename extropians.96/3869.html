<i>&gt;OK, Radioactivity was their big hit, but most of their music </i><br>
<i>&gt;celebrated various aspects of technology, such as PCs, train travel, </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Internet.  That and the beauty of their compositions, whose </i><br>

<i>&gt;recorded in a garage.  I consider Kraftwerk's music transhumanist.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I realize that certain splits have developed among techno devotees </i><br>
<i>&gt;lately as to what constitutes "true" techno, but I love it in all its </i><br>
<i>&gt;forms.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;The humorous irony that suffuses most of Kraftwerk's compositions </i><br>
<i>&gt;always brings a smile to my face, especially the song they wrote </i><br>
<i>&gt;about the old-style pocket calculators that had musical tones </i><br>

Well i guess you agree that if not anti-technology, they were at least not<br>
promoting it wholeheartedly either, whereas some of todays producers are far<br>
more positive about promoting technology, viewing it as a tool to solve<br>
problems for the future, rather than create problems. In track titles,<br>
project names, song texts (using more 'computer style' effects on vocals),<br>
and in the music as well, this becomes more evident. In general the machine<br>
side is replacing the human side of the music more and more, and guess what<br>
?, the kids just love it !!!<br>
<p>
As to the confusion about what constitutes 'true' techno, i think that's a<br>
little off the subject for this particular newsgroup. Try the 313 group,<br>
&lt;313@hyperreal.com&gt; for that one... <br>

Ray Peck writes, in response to Max M:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Um, the first Kraftwerk album was 1970 or 71, as was the first Cluster</i><br>
<i>&gt;album (why Cluster is always forgotten in these dicussions, I'll never</i><br>
<i>&gt;know).</i><br>
<p>
Sure, but i think Max meant here that the character of that music didn't<br>
change until the mid to late 70's. (i always keep 1978 as a personal<br>
guideline) where it was being produced electronically before, it still had<br>
much in common with more 'traditional' music. I'm not saying it was less<br>
exerimental or less innovating, it just became 'different', less 'emotional'<br>
(or maybe more, depending on your point of view ;-) ), and more 'technical'<br>
in sound.<br>
