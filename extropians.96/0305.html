<i>&gt;Corporations, typically, are designed orders. They are deliberately</i><br>

<p>
I've never said spontaneously ordering processes can only give rise to other<br>
spontaneously ordering processes: what I _have_ said is that spontaneously<br>
ordering processes can only give rise to spontaneous orders, by definition.<br>
The deliberate structure of a corporation, whether or not that corporation<br>
itself is formed by a spontaneously ordering process, is implemented by a<br>
non-SO process. I certainly wouldn't disagree that a spontaneous order could<br>
lose it's 'spontaneity' by intervening process: I think your reply is<br>
anwering 'No' to my question 'Can you give me an example where this isn't<br>
the case, with no intervening process which is not spontaneously ordering?'.<br>
<p>
It isn't spontaneous ordering processes which 'produce results inimical to<br>
spontaneous order', it's intervening non-SO processes which do that, as you<br>
describe.<br>
<p>
I don't think we're disagreeing about this, are we Max?<br>
