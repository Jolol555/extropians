Lyle, with your short attention span I don't expect you to read this entire <br>
post, it is almost half a page long and no pictures, but maybe you can find <br>
somebody to explain the gist of it to you.<br>
<p>
After shooting down the idea that Nanotechnology is logically inconsistent or  <br>
would violate the laws of Quantum Mechanics or Thermodynamics or Economics,   <br>
and after blowing out of the water the idea that it is possible but not  <br>
important, we at last come to the core objection that almost everybody has  <br>
about Nanotechnology, it STRONGLY violates Lyle's Law. <br>
<p>
Lyle's Law, which I have taken the liberty of naming for a well known member <br>
of the Extropian list, could be stated as follows:<br>
<p>
  LYLE'S LAW: Whatever the future has in store for us of one thing we should   <br>
  be certain, the universe must be constructed in such a way that the majority  <br>
  of late 20 'th century bipeds on the third planet orbiting a small star on   <br>
  the edge of a run of the mill galaxy will never find things odd. <br>
<p>
I don't claim to have rigorously disproved Lyle's Law, but you need a great <br>
deal of evidence before you elevate something to a law of nature. Personally  <br>
I don't think there is enough evidence to support Lyle's Law, indeed to my  <br>
perhaps superficial eye, there is much that points in the in the other <br>
direction.<br>
<p>
<p>
