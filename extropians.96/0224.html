I enjoyed Robin Hanson's article entitled The Great Filter<br>
( <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html</a> ) but disagree<br>
that an optimistic future involves large-scale colonization of space<br>
or even space travel at all. I think it's quite possible to have an<br>
utopian future without even getting off the Earth. The advance<br>
of space exploration technology seems to pale next to the advance<br>
of computer hardware and software. Seems to me then that there's a<br>
good possibility we'll invent numerous new worlds to explore within<br>
software constructs that may satisfy the urge to expand. From what I<br>
recall, prior to the discovery of possible ex-life on Mars, that a<br>
manned Mars mission was scheduled for maybe the 2020's, thus placing<br>
it in the later period of Vinge's singularity timeframe of 2005-2030.<br>
Thus I think there's an good chance we'll become transcendent post-<br>
humanity long before any major manned exploration or colonization<br>
activities within our solar system.<br>
<p>
This leads to some interesting consequences: if only a portion of<br>
mankind transcends, they might leave enough advanced artifacts<br>
around for the remainder to do the major physical engineering projects<br>
to explore and colonize space. Maybe all those UFO's are full of<br>
alien idiots who couldn't transcend along with their fellows.<br>
<p>
Of possible interst: some years ago while playing with SimEarth I<br>
found that the "goal" (your nanotech cities lifting off from the<br>
surface) could be done fairly quickly with massive science funding<br>
with the unfortunate side effect of a "hellish" (the games's term)<br>
existence for your sim-populace. In one scenario I managed to delay<br>
this goal for several centuries while keeping my populace in the<br>
advanced info-age, with a fairly utopian existence (i.e., 20-30<br>
hour work weeks as opposed to 70-90 hour work weeks).<br>
