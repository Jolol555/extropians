Lyle, still smitten with his sex slave fantasy, writes:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;This is very, very bizarre.  I wish I could show this post to Leslie and</i><br>
watch the expression on her face.  The word "sexist" never entered her mind.<br>
 She would never use such language.  That was one thing we had in common. &gt;<br>
<p>
The ONLY thing I am sure ; - )  <br>
SEXIST: what women call you when they DONT want you<br>
to have sex with them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I take my miracles when I can get them...  Leslie didn't have a great mind,</i><br>
but in her limited way she was a real artist, not a "political" artist.&gt;  <br>
<p>
That is BAITING of the first order, Lyle, there is no <br>
such thing as being either one  and you know it. <br>
BAD BOY&gt;BAD! DOWN BOY, SIT!   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(I'm using the past tense because she died last year, more or less the  same</i><br>
way Jimi Hendrix died.) <br>
<p>
OooooH! Sorry,  Now i know what you mean by "real artist"!<br>
 A dead one.   <br>
<p>
But Lyle you said your miracle didn't involve any mystic<br>
event! What about the resurection she had to have to be <br>
your slave?  Has there been some new South African breakthrough involving<br>
dead beauties?  Or you trying to<br>
start another trend: Necrophilia?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I basically agree with your conclusion, and I intend to find a woman who</i><br>
shares my interests and passions.  The amazing thing is that my interests &amp;<br>
passions, which used to be extremely esoteric, have suddenly become the<br>
trendiest thing on campus.  Another miracle.<br>
<p>
TRUE! you win. <br>
