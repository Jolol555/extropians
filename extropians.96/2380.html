In reply to my statement, <br>
<p>
:: A marijuana garden in a mansion in Beverly Hills <br>
:: is not illegal in the same way that a garden in an apartment is illegal.  <br>

<i>&gt; But don't forget there was an LA millionaire who was killed by </i><br>
police<br>
<i>&gt; (DEA-LA?) when his neighbors reported possible drug activity </i><br>
<i>&gt; on his  property.  It turned out it he was just eccentric and had no </i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal drugs.  But, he still was shot and killed by police.  </i><br>
<p>
Good point.  I had forgotten about that incident.  <br>
<p>
This reminds me of something that happened in Berkeley about <br>
1970 or 71.  The cops raided a house in the Berkeley hills.  A woman <br>
and her son were sitting quietly in the living room, watching TV.  <br>
CRASH #1 -- the police smashed the door with a battering ram.  <br>
CRASH #2 -- the chandelier fell to the floor and shattered into a million <br>
pieces.  A dozen cops swarmed through the house with drawn guns, <br>
and found no one except the woman and her son, who were not amused.  <br>
The cops had come to the wrong address.  The next day, the chief of <br>
police had the unpleasant task of going to see this lady and her husband, <br>
and apologizing.  As I heard the story at the time, the pig's ears burned <br>
for weeks afterward.  These people were in a position to call an idiot <br>
an idiot and get away with it.  <br>
<p>
Nevertheless, the cops did raid a house in the hills, and if it had been <br>
the right house, there would have been no apologies.  <br>
<p>
Even billionaires are not entirely above the law (as Michael Jackson <br>
and Michael Milken both found out).  <br>
<p>
I think the man you refer to who got shot lived in Pacific Palisades, <br>
which is a beautiful area, and a good place to conceal a garden, but <br>
not quite the kind of neighborhood I had in mind.  <br>
<p>
There are some houses in Beverly Hills where such a raid would be <br>
almost impossible.  The cops would have to use a tank to get in the <br>
front gate.  In some parts of Beverly Hills, the Hollywood hills, and <br>
outlying areas such as Palm Springs, all kinds of outrageous things <br>
go on, but the cops seldom get involved unless somebody gets killed <br>
(as in "American Gigolo").   In these areas, the neighbors aren't <br>
going to be reporting drug activity, because they can't see over the wall.  <br>
Besides, in these areas the neighbors aren't the kind of people who <br>
would report drug activity to the police even if they knew about it.  <br>
They respect each other's privacy.  <br>
<p>
The question is whether it is possible to have a nark-free neighborhood <br>
without spending $20 million for an estate in the hills or the desert.  <br>
<p>
There is an entirely different way to approach this.  <br>

<i>&gt; Miracles require absolute forgetfulness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've had a few personal experiences which though certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; not scientifically rigorous, fit well with this idea. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, it is easy to demonstrate than once there is a miracle, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it always has a plausible causal explanation.  </i><br>
<p>
This is a strange and subtle idea:  a miracle with a causal explanation.  <br>
In what sense is it a miracle?  <br>
<p>
Here is an example.  In 1989 I met Leslie Graves, my favorite pin-up <br>
girl, and eventually she became my (more or less voluntary) sex slave.  <br>
Does this qualify as a miracle?  I would say so.  It doesn't contradict <br>
the laws of physics, but it is an extremely rare and wondrous event, <br>
and it was something I had concentrated on and anticipated for years. <br>
<p>
Another possible example, which will bring us back to our subject:  <br>
Twenty years ago, cigarette smoke was ubiquitous.  If someone had <br>
said, in 1976, that there would be a time when smoking would be <br>
illegal in all restaurants in Los Angeles, and entire shopping malls <br>
would be smoke-free, most people would have thought they were <br>
crazy.  And yet, here we are.  I think this qualifies as a miracle in <br>
Hara Ra's sense. <br>
<p>
Twenty years from now, there may be marijuana plants growing <br>
on the White House lawn.  This seems impossible now, but <br>
no more impossible than the idea of smoke-free malls in 1976.  <br>
Miracles do happen.  <br>
<p>
There are also examples of people who have gone through the midst of <br>
war -- the war on drugs or any other war -- and emerged without a <br>
scratch, while everyone around them was getting cut to pieces.  <br>
This too is a "miracle" which is compatible with causality.  <br>
<p>
I am not wedded to the idea of focusing on money.  Being rich is <br>
one way to have freedom, but not the only way, and not necessarily <br>
the best way.  The best way to deal with the DEA is simply(!) <br>
to make it disappear.  Imagine a nark-free world, and walk into <br>
that reality.  Miracles require absolute forgetfulness...  Miracles also, <br>
paradoxically, require a deep understanding of causality (but not <br>
necessarily an articulate understanding).  <br>
<p>
E. Shaun Russell quotes George Bernard Shaw as follows:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The men who dream at night do just that --dream, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but the men who dream at day are the ones who can </i><br>
<i>&gt; turn their dreams into reality. </i><br>
<p>
What about men who have lucid dreams in the daytime?  <br>
