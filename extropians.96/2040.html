On Tax Day, 2000 this might be the day anyone who wishes to get away without<br>
paying income tax, CAN! due to the chaos which will ensue in 2000 from the<br>
clock bug. There will be _so many_ glitches that it will be overwhelming to<br>
possibly keep track of all the people not paying their taxes or possibly you<br>
could at least get away with a year or two of not paying and blame it on the<br>
glitch. This also gives us the great opportunity to consider if we wish<br>
income taxes to continue or not?<br>
