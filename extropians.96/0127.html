Discredited??? Not by a LONG shot! Darwin published his wonderful book in <br>
1859 and I know of no theory in the Sciences, physical or biological, that has  <br>
held up from that day to this better than Darwin's Theory of Evolution. It's <br>
true that there has been some sniping between Richard Dawkins, a hard line  <br>
Darwin supporter, and Steven Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, but even if their <br>
"Punctuated Evolution" turns out to be true they have admitted it would just <br>
be a minor alteration to Darwin's magnificent edifice. Gould has also stated <br>
that in his opinion Darwin was the greatest scientist who ever lived, and <br>
although not strictly relevant, a remarkably likable fellow as well. <br>
Personally I would rank Darwin a close second behind Newton, but Newton  <br>
although a great genius, was also a very unpleasant man.<br>
