Interesting thread. The moral seems to be that there is an immense<br>
variability of how drugs affect people and modes of thought. <br>
<p>
The drugs used right now seem to be blunt instruments to change the <br>
tricky structures in the mind, this is why I prefer cognitive methods of <br>
altering my mind (not that they can't be supplemented with some chemistry <br>
too). <br>
<p>
Whether an individual drug has a positive or negative effect probably <br>
depends on exactly how the individual brain is organized; some people <br>
have schemata/neurocircuits that hinder them and can be neutralized by a <br>
certain drug, others have useful structures that are inhibited by the <br>
same drug. <br>
<p>
A lot of our thinking is also state-dependent, and doesn't transfer easily<br>
to other states (both due to memory impairment like in sleep or<br>
hallucinogenic experiences or simply being a very different mode of<br>
thought, like in the psychedelic or mystic experience). I think it may be<br>
a good idea to learn about what mental states one can reach, and what<br>
properties they have (some can be surprising, I get better at set theory<br>
when I have a cold and much more creative when dead tired). <br>
<p>
The more I study the brain and its function, the more surprised I become<br>
even rudimentary rational thought is possible. That changes in<br>
psychochemistry would cause major changes in thinking and behavior is<br>
obvious, but so far we have only been able to hit single neurotransmittors<br>
or receptors (we are getting better). The next step would probably be <br>
some way to interact with individual brain structures (perhaps determined <br>
by cell morphology?), then we would really be on to something!<br>
