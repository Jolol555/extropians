<i>&gt;         Perhaps you should have stayed on the prozac.  As far as I can see,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are an arrogant bastard...and that's putting it nicely.  Just one</i><br>
<i>&gt; question, Eliezer: in your rose-tinted world, is there such a thing as</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'consideration'?  If not, I think your condition is drastically greater than</i><br>
<i>&gt; you might expect (though that is bound to be naught).</i><br>
<p>
Prozac would make me more arrogant, not less.  It acts on some of the<br>
self-esteem systems and increases your opinion of yourself, which is why<br>
it is often prescribed for depressions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;There's no use in discussing anything, anything at all, that takes place</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in a world where there are transhumans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You've never been faced with anything smarter than you were so you &gt;cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibly appreciate what it is like.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;In conclusion, remember that I might not be right, but if I say you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wrong, you're almost certainly wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting choice of quotes - almost certain to give a wildly<br>
misleading picture of my post.  The first quote and the scond belong<br>
together, but the third implies that I mean that *I* was transhuman and<br>
that *I* was smarter than *you*.  Full humans are smarter than me in at<br>
least two areas that I can think of, with Godel, Escher, Bach being the<br>
concrete example that forced me into an appreciation of the<br>
Singularity.  You aren't an Algernon, all of your cognitive systems<br>
remain intact, so you're smart enough to be on a par with the rest of<br>
humanity.  I'm not.<br>
<p>
Anything I say may be distorted and remixed and used against me.  Sigh.<br>
