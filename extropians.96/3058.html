Sometimes terms like "eternal life" and "immortality" seemed to get <br>
tossed around pretty casually around here.  This is a bit curious to me,<br>
since one of the main driving forces behind my leaving Xtianity (and <br>
ultimately bumping into transhumanism)that the idea of truly eternal <br>
life ceased to automatically be appealing or even make any sense.<br>
	What do I mean, it doesn't make sense?  Eternal life and <br>
immortality as traditionally conceived refer to infinities. (I'm using <br>
"eternal" in its temporal, rather than atemporal, sense). Everybody<br>
on this list is certainly well acquainted with the fundamental <br>
difference between an infinite quantitity and a finite quantity, no <br>
matter how large.  An infinity is as different from a finite quantity as<br>
any finite quantity is from a zero.<br>
	To make a not exactly logical leap here, it seems equally <br>
obvious that an infinite (or semi-infinite) lifespan is as different<br>
from any finite lifespan as a finite lifespan is from never existing at<br>
all.  Theologians have long recognized this difficulty.  Unfortunately, <br>
the answers they give tend to boil down to the most intellectually <br>
dishonest trick in their arsenal: It's beyond human understanding.<br>
	What I want to know is, how many of you want real eternal life<br>
as opposed to an indefinite lifespan? (The difference here is a fuzzy <br>
part of these wonderings, but the real difficulties that come with <br>
eternal life don't seem to be a problem with indefinite lifespans.) <br>
For those of you who do, how do you conceive of such an existence?  <br>
Much has been written in extropian circles about how one can <br>
meaningfully retain one's identity while vastly augmenting one's mental <br>
capabilities.  It seems to me that if one proposes truly eternal life, <br>
the task must be at least partially repeated to justify a claim to being <br>
the same person, living eternally.<br>
	As to myself, I'm inclined towards a bit despair (not very <br>
extropian, for sure.)  Some form of atemporality seems the best option,<br>
but this is really fuzzy territory.<br>
