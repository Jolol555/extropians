Mrs. Gooches Health franchises are the churches for this meme.<br>

I didn't think of this one. True<br>

I do endorse this idea to a degree because it allows more products such as<br>
herbal products to market because the normal privitized medical area can't<br>
generate enough cash from them to make them profitable to market. Also<br>
slightly varying doses are better than exactly measured amounts because our<br>
bodies were never made for exact amounts because out bodies enjoy a degree<br>
of randomness and change rather than stale static amounts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nature's pharmacy is mostly poison.</i><br>
I like this quote.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Does the Second Coming have anything to do with multiple orgasms?</i><br>
Now this is TRUELY clever. hehe<br>
