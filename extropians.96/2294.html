<p>
Well, the Internet makes us into very partial gods. The big problem is <br>
not access, it is finding and using information. And that is very <br>
nontrivial, we need to develop computer-aided cognition (CAC). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; God also means having the power to create life and with nano, or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; closer to our present time: genetic engineering. We have almost filled the</i><br>
<i>&gt; requirements for being a judeo-christian god. Why would I need a super-AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; for any of this?</i><br>
<p>
Seen any nano recently? Noticed some megaengineering? I shouldn't be<br>
sarcastic, but we are very far from the judeo-christian god. I would say<br>
we will only get close to the transcendent entity they refer to at the<br>
Omega Point. (see below)<br>
<p>
And yes, you would need super-AI to create life with nano, either as a <br>
part of yourself or as your designer. It is not trivial at all (just look <br>
at any book on cell biology). Creating good artificial life in virtual <br>
reality is hard enough. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Human brains can already be make to multitask stemming</i><br>
<i>&gt; from multiple personality disorder where multiple people can live out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same brain.</i><br>
<p>
These personalities does not work in parallel, instead they seem to be <br>
different metastable "attractors" of the brain. The person shifts between <br>
them (and they can be extremely different - there are even differences in <br>
their sensory evolked potentials!), but when a personality isn't "used" <br>
it doesn't exist. But we have plenty of other multitask power in our <br>
unconscious mind. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Yes, I would definitely start working on building worlds (not entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;universes at first), but their complexities are still limited by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;amount of computation power we have - and that will be limited and cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;money too. Read _Permutation City_ by Greg Egan for some ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You need not even render them! You can describe them in fine detail on</i><br>
<i>&gt; paper or in a text file and when truely simple VRML design tools come</i><br>
<i>&gt; around, you can begin building these worlds and gradually upgrade them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the next design format standard that comes out and continually increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; detail till uploading time comes.</i><br>
<p>
I was talking about running them. Let's say I want to create a cellular<br>
automaton universe (the Autoverse) with roughly the same internal size and<br>
complexity as the solar system. Assume we use clever compression so we<br>
only have to deal with the places where matter exists, then we have around<br>
10^31 kg of virtual matter, containing around 10^23 "atoms" each - 10^54<br>
bits for the whole simulation. This simulation will not run in a computer <br>
smaller than a star unless we can find some very clever optimizations...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Won't change your mind much? Hows knowing the sum of human knowledge sound?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember with uploading you fill the requirements for a judeo-christian god</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is the god-like being standards which most people refer to.</i><br>
<p>
No, you will at best become something close to a greek god - powerful,<br>
knowledgeable, immortal and able to change yourself and the world. But you<br>
are still not the least bit transcendent, omniscient, omnipotent or<br>
omnipresent. <br>
<p>
The sum of human knowledge sounds nice. But I want more. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why in even a primitive upload you will have some sort of virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment such as looking through the eyes of an avatar in Alpha World or</i><br>
<i>&gt; having the first person perspective of the player in quake. You will have</i><br>
<i>&gt; some sort of sensory data coming in or it would be torture to sit in stasis</i><br>
<i>&gt; waiting for technology to increase to the point of good VR. Especially as</i><br>
<i>&gt; an uploaded being, waiting for sufficently advanced VR would be torture</i><br>
<i>&gt; because if your mental processes are _much_ faster, one day of waiting may</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem like 10 years and this is a very conservative estimate.</i><br>
<p>
But you could of course simply halt them until the necessary technology <br>
arrives. Instant (forward) timetravel. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I could care</i><br>
<i>&gt; less if my ideas were the only thing that transferred to the digital realm.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I want to live in it! ME! ME! ME!</i><br>
<p>
