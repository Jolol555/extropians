<i>&gt; If nobody in the world has secrets except me, that means I know all about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketing plans and product development of your company but you know nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; about mine, that gives my company an advantage, it will grow and so will the</i><br>
<i>&gt; privacy meme. The only way Brin's world could work is if everybody was</i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly like Mr. Brin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
A world of Brins is certainly not impossible. Mr. Brin made an attempt<br>
at describing an Environmentally Stable Strategy (ESS) which would<br>
continue to suppress the privacy meme when he talked about a culture in<br>
which chicks didn't dig paranoid guys. I would further predict that<br>
where such an ESS holds, no one will buy your products if they don't<br>
know what future corporate strategies their money might be financing.<br>
Once an ESS for a totally open society is established, privacy minded<br>
people will be feared for their lack of openness. ("If I can’t see what<br>
he’s doing how do I know its not evil?") The increased tolerance of the<br>
society I described would apply to everything except your privacy. In<br>
your above example you would at best be shunned and at worst killed out<br>
of fear, depending on what other Altruistic Class memes were common to<br>
the society.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, if I tell all and have no secrets but everybody else has</i><br>
<i>&gt; secrets, then it is my company will be at a disadvantage and shrink, and so</i><br>
<i>&gt; will the transparency meme. </i><br>
<p>
Absolutely true, and this example is closer to the current conditions of<br>
our society. So the question is, how do we get from the current privacy<br>
ESS into a transparency ESS? The answer is: the same way Earth changes<br>
from a dark warm planet to a bright cold planet during an ice age. The<br>
(social) climate breaks away from a local strange attractor when the<br>
proper chaotic conditions align to give it the necessary escape<br>
velocity.<br>
<p>
This might happen, and it might not. I will maintain only that it could,<br>
and that the result would not have to be the drastic loss of individual<br>
liberty that you predict.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wonderful though it would be, the world need not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be full of people like me for Crypto Anarchy to work.</i><br>
<p>
I’m not sure what you mean by Crypto Anarchy working. In fact, I’m a<br>
little shaky on the whole Crypto Anarchy thing. Please point me to some<br>
info.<br>
<p>
Regardless, my above argument doesn’t say it won’t work, only that a<br>
society could develop in which it is neither wanted or needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;              &gt;Certainly secret ballot would disappear, but would it be needed?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not really, but then elections aren't needed either...</i><br>
<p>
Nor is would a democracy by representation be needed. We would have a<br>
pure democracy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By the way, I'm not sending Brin a copy of this, he made it crystal clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he doesn't want to talk to me again, EVER! That's fine with me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I suspect he's listening in. (Hi Mr. Brin!) If not he's missing out on<br>
some good source material for his book, as he will certainly want to<br>
have characters arguing the point.<br>
