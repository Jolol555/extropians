   I Play the Game<br>
<p>
I love to play.<br>
<p>
I am learning to play <br>
with more and more <br>
of my world.<br>
<p>
I play around <br>
with whatever resources I have,<br>
seeing what I can do with what I've got.<br>
<p>
My play is my creativity and my intellect <br>
working together,<br>
learning how to more accurately <br>
create what I want for myself<br>
<p>
My mind grows <br>
and I become more intelligent as I play.<br>
<p>
I play with the world <br>
and learn how things work<br>
and learn what I'm capable of.<br>
<p>
My current playing trains my mind <br>
for more challenging levels of play.<br>
<p>
My talents keep blossoming<br>
as I create and engage in new, <br>
more challanging games.<br>
<p>
My games train my mind,<br>
and I become a more powerful player of games.<br>
<p>
My life is my game,<br>
and I am working on <br>
being a master player of my life,<br>
to be skillful in fulfilling my desires.<br>
<p>
That is the object of the game, for me;<br>
to fulfill my desires more and more effectively,<br>
to keep improving myself<br>
and becoming more skillful in creating <br>
the situations and experiences that I want.<br>
<p>
Reality is my playground <br>
and my workshop.<br>
<p>
I develop the skills and tools required <br>
to create and alter my reality<br>
to be the way I wish it to be,<br>
to express my deepest values<br>
through the reality I create for myself.<br>
<p>
It requires much curiosity <br>
and playfulness<br>
for me to develop an understanding <br>
of how reality works<br>
and how to alter my current reality<br>
to be more as I desire my reality to be.<br>
<p>
I am a Reality Hacker.<br>
I learn how my reality works,<br>
and I become it's master.<br>
<p>
I am my reality.<br>
<p>
As I master my reality,<br>
I master my self.<br>
I learn to be what I want to be,<br>
to create my self, according to my ideals.<br>
<p>
I'm learning to understand my self<br>
and alter my self <br>
to be more like I desire my self to be.<br>
<p>
I play the game.<br>
<p>
Do you?<br>
<p>
