<i>&gt;         Eliezer appears to have rejected some aspects of youthful masculinity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What else can we automatically conclude from this, that is not on the surface?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alas, nothing.</i><br>
<p>
It would be more accurate to say that I know what they are and how to<br>
control/suppress/ignore them.  When you reject something, it is no<br>
longer a part of you.  And if you rebel, then you just wind up ignoring<br>
their *existence* and they still control you.  Rebellion is part of<br>
being a teenager, so I try to avoid it.<br>
<p>
What else can you automatically conclude from it?  I don't know.  I<br>
haven't noticed any cognitive side effects, if that's what you mean.  Or<br>
are we talking sociological adjustments?  What kind of conclusions were<br>
you trying to draw?  I'm a complex person and a lot of my personality<br>
derives from my games with my emotional nature, but I don't know how<br>
much of that is necessary, or how much of it should be concluded without<br>
asking me.<br>
