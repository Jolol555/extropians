Suresh, the reason why corporations that pollute do so and get away with<br>
it is because it is on "public" land. Here's a little ditty to explain<br>
it:<br>
<p>
The problem with common ownership is that something which belongs to<br>
everybody actually winds up belonging to nobody because everybody<br>
wouldn't take care of it, and nobody was responsible. Somebody came<br>
along and (polluted/stole/trashed/ you pick it) it. Nobody thought that<br>
somebody would do it, but everybody just sat there watching, because it<br>
was nobody's job to take make sure that didn't happen. Somebody said, I<br>
own it now, and if anybody wants it, they are going to have to pay me to<br>
use it, and while everybody objected, nobody would do anything.<br>
<p>
See.....<br>
<p>
If things belong to people as individuals, then they will take care of<br>
them, and make sure nothing happens to them. Common ownership is<br>
abandonment.<br>
