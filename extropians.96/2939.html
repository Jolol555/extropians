<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These bacteria have been recovered from deep sea volcanic vents, deep</i><br>

True, there are some organisms who can thrive in this environment, but their<br>
makeup is significantly different than surface dwelling organisms.  The<br>
pressure where they live allows liquid water reactions to continue to occur.<br>
Even then, there is a soft limit somewhere around 150-170 C for most<br>
organics.  The absolute hard limit on any planet is somewhere around 375 C<br>
since this is where water goes supercritical, although very few organics<br>
would survive even to this point (except maybe some halides and a few<br>
proteins).  Cells require a pretty broad spectrum of organic compounds to<br>
operate, and the number of options decreases rapidly as the temperature<br>
increases.  <br>
<p>
Sub-zero lifeforms are not that unusual, although it is unusual for higher<br>
lifeforms to exist in these environments.  In an environment that is<br>
perpetually subzero, I would expect to find either very primitive nervous<br>
systems, or nervous systems that operated in a different fashion than ours.<br>
The nervous systems found on this planet don't operate well in cold<br>
environments, since they rely on ion/molecule transport.  This is why<br>
mammals found in cold climates on this planet require immense quantities of<br>
insulation.<br>
