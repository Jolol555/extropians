It is not dense enough for sustained fusion, sure. But though metallic <br>
hydrogen is lacking tritium (which is bred from lithium by fission nuke <br>
primer), it has a fairly high proton density. Otoh lithium deuteride is <br>
compressed, before it is ignited... I dunno, lacking a calculation I <br>
cannot say anything. Has anybody made such a calculation? Hydrodynamics <br>
codes for star simulations should probably be able to do this....<br>

I was thinking about briefly warming one's hands in the afterglow of the <br>

P.S. One even more outlandish way to generate power, would be to create <br>
tiny singularities, then feeding them with matter until their blackbody <br>
Hawking emission maximum moves into the visible range. But how can one <br>
create singularities? The sun is losing about 2 Mt of matter/s in form of <br>
radiation, if we could harness some of it... E.g. concentrating _a lot_ <br>
of laser beams on a tiny focus, setting up a particle accelerator in the <br>
solar orbit, imploding a piece of matter by an antimatter shell <br>
(provided, we can generate antimatter much better efficiency than now)<br>
