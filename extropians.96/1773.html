Why should you care that much if your decendants don't know where<br>
exactly in space you lived, as long as they shared your values and<br>
other central characteristics?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Denying resources requires an a priori evaluation of the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitors capabilities, which probably is not possible in</i><br>
<i>&gt;practice.</i><br>
<p>
If you colonize a system, then you have a good chance of beating away<br>
competitors, or at the worst blowing it to smithereens rather than let<br>
them have it.  If you don't, its there for the taking by others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One method of countering this obstacle is to blast clear corridors</i><br>

<p>
Anyone try to work out the details on this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;slower the maximum speed, the smaller is the Great Filter that needs</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to be explained.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[I dont think this changes the equation much</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you, but was trying to list all plausible important<br>
factors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[[There may be practical upper limits on the size of a (self  aware</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, beyond whicha high power function of signal propagation</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed, OS complexity, etc. diminishesor even reverses the gains in</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational power. Gravitational limits also come into play, long</i><br>
<i>&gt;before a Jupiter-size brain is reached.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A superintelligencemay find at some point it doesnt want to get any</i><br>
<i>&gt;bigger.This point may be physically small.  Sending clones of itself to </i><br>
<i>&gt;other star systems would not help its realtime crunching at all.]]</i><br>
<p>
Dan Clemmensen raised this point, and I tried to respond to it in some<br>
detail.  Did you read those posts?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;..  The point is that in general the creatures whose purposes lead to </i><br>
<i>&gt;the most reproduction end up dominating the future. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[This an argument for quantity over quality. Since viri and bacteria </i><br>
<i>&gt;reproduce the fastest and the mostest, do they therefore dominate?]]</i><br>
<p>
Yes, they have dominated for quite some time.  We have a shot at<br>
beating them, but haven't done so yet. <br>

P.S. I'll respond more to the "berserker" issues in my next post.<br>
