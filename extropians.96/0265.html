the escalator, I glanced at the large display of new fiction books, and I <br>
immediately saw the book (from about twenty meters away) and had a strong <br>
urge to check it out ...  I don't even have the metaphysical framework to <br>
understand how these things happen."<br>

I think the simple explanation for your experience, at least with this <br>
particular book, is that your subconscious pattern-matching routines noticed <br>
the title's similarity to Minsky's "Society of Mind" (unless somehow you've <br>
never happened to have heard of Minsky's book!), identified a distinction, <br>
and sent an interrupt to your conscious mind which was ignored until your <br>
higher priority chores had been completed.  Then, this "urge" on your <br>
"stack" popped up, seemingly out of nowhere.  These type of dangling threads <br>
in our stream of consciousness happen all the time, we just rarely pay any <br>
attention to them.<br>
