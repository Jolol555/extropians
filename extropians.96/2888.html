Only the thousand words used to describe the picture[1].  We moved away<br>
from hieroglyphics to arbitrary ideograms and letter-cominations/words.<br>
I suspect general intelligent abstract communication centers on<br>
intelligences agreeing on arbitrary symbols for common ideas, somehow<br>
inducting that the ideas are in fact common.  The main benefit of<br>
complex visual symbols versus spoken and written words would be if our<br>
brains were better at processing one species than the other.  Given how<br>
we evolved, I doubt this is the case.<br>

Truly flexible Powers might use whatever symbols they felt like.  The<br>
key change being not in the tools they can use to produce symbols but in<br>
the mental ability to perceive symbols of various types -- such as many<br>
people being more comfortable with letters rather than numbers, even<br>
when they are being used as arbitrary symbols in logic games<br>
[Hofstadter], or my suspicion that I'm worse at computer chess because<br>
the graphics don't trigger my chess perceptive networks.<br>

Which is why studying etymology is neat, and the history of one's<br>
language.  E.g: the proposal that English spelling be reformed so that<br>
each phoneme has one spelling would lose information: words with 'ph'<br>
for the 'f'-sound tend to be Greek.<br>
<p>
All hail the Scots/English/evolutionary Enlightenment.<br>
<p>
(now, if there's a disadvantage to each spelling mapping to one phoneme,<br>
I haven't thought of it.)<br>
