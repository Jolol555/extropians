Personally, I have no use for encryption.  I sometimes write cryptic <br>
messages ("riddles"), but I have never encrypted a message.  I don't <br>
even know how to use PGP.  I have little interest in such things.  <br>
(I have no interest in Ayn Rand, either.)  Encrypting messages is like <br>
painting your windows black:  it just attracts attention.  Encrypting <br>
messages and talking about tax evasion at the same time is idiotic.  <br>
<p>
Nevertheless, I don't think David Brin's "transparent society" makes <br>
much sense, either.   <br>
<p>
He keeps asking if anyone can give an example from history in which <br>
giving masks to the little guys prevented the big guys with swords <br>
from taking over.  The short answer is No:  there is no such example.  <br>
But so what?  <br>
<p>
David, let me ask you back:  <br>
<p>
1.  Can you give an example from history in which *anything* <br>
prevented big guys with swords from taking over?  <br>
<p>
2.  How is this relevant to our situation?  We aren't trying to prevent a <br>
takeover.  <br>

<i>&gt; You [Hal Finney] perceive the best defense as giving all the po' folks </i><br>
<i>&gt; armor plate and masks to walk around in, saying this will keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mighty from harming us'ns.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I say, give the masses light sabers and make the kings and priests and </i><br>
<i>&gt; rich men walk around in their skivvies like the rest of us.  </i><br>
<p>
You can't "make" the kings and priests and rich men do anything.  <br>
You have only two choices;  either join them, or create a culture <br>
in which they don't want to be tyrants.  <br>
<p>
The latter choice is not impossible.  Such cultures have existed before.  <br>
For example, after the American Revolution, George Washington <br>
could have been King, but he refused.  He lived in a culture, and indeed <br>
helped to create a culture, in which people despised kings.  He wasn't <br>
about to become one himself.  <br>
<p>
But the first choice is more interesting to me, and I don't see why it <br>
hasn't been considered.  The assumption throughout this discussion, on <br>
both sides, seems to be that "we" are the po' folks.  We are the masses.  <br>
Well, I'm not.  In the words of one of my favorite songs, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's your name?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who's your daddy? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is he rich... </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is he rich like me?  </i><br>
