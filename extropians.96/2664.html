Yeah, it's late. I'm a gaper, sue me. They're both dead guys who wore<br>

Show a demonstration of fitness and I'll think about it.<br>
<p>
A demonstrably large percentage of the supposed intellectual elite<br>
around today remind me more of the sniveling latinos of the late Roman<br>
empire that let the barbarians in the gates, than the early ones whos<br>
mother's told them, "Come home with your shield or on it."<br>
<p>
As for leading today's whining masses? Excuse me I've got better things<br>
to do. <br>
<p>
TO me, leading is by action and example, not by political maneuvering,<br>
rhetorical warfare, and pandering to the most common denominators.  I<br>
would show much more leadership by getting the hell off this planet just<br>
to prove that all the crap that people claim is a bunch of nonsense.<br>
