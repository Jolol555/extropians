<i>&gt;A high school freshman at age 10 - you really were a prodigy!</i><br>
<p>
Mostly the fault of my parents.  They were both college educated and they<br>
taught me reading and arithmetic before I even started kindergarten.  In the<br>
state of Washington at the time, they used to give children IQ tests prior<br>
to entering kindergarten.  I am pretty sure my extensive pre-kindergarten<br>
education skewed the results, because my IQ scores were considered<br>
remarkable.  Is it still politically correct to give kids IQ tests these days?<br>
<p>
They went to great lengths to get a computer for me to use when I was young<br>
(circa 1980) despite the fact that we lived in poverty at the time.  I<br>
attribute my current success in the computer industry to the fact that they<br>
bought that first computer (which I loved the instant they got it).  A<br>
worthwhile investment with good foresight on their part.  Sadly, they still<br>
aren't particularly computer literate.<br>
<p>
I hold the theory that differences in measured IQ can be mostly attributed<br>
to the environment the kid is brought up in from 0-6 years, with genetics<br>
being a less differentiating factor.  When I was born, both my parents had a<br>
lot of time on their hands, so they spent their time teaching me and playing<br>
with me.  I have three younger brothers, but by the time they were born, my<br>
parents didn't have as much time anymore, and they had to divide their<br>
attention among more kids.  The fact that all my siblings have an IQ of at<br>
least 140 may be partially attributable to good genetics (there are a lot of<br>
engineers and scientists in my family tree), but this only provides a higher<br>
than average baseline for good environment to work on.  There is a<br>
noticeable pattern in the IQs of my siblings and myself that can be<br>
correlated to certain environmental factors.<br>

<i>&gt;Well, Lyle has said he took them back in the early 60s.  However, I </i><br>

<i>&gt;Date    Grade   Age    Percentile   Test</i><br>

<i>&gt;6911        9       14          98          ITED</i><br>
<i>&gt;7011       10      15          97          ITED</i><br>
<i>&gt;7110       11       16         88          PSAT</i><br>
<i>&gt;7111       11       16         87          ITED</i><br>
<i>&gt;7202       11       16         96          CTMM</i><br>
<i>&gt;7204       11       16         86          SAT</i><br>
<i>&gt;73??       12       17     Skipped the tests?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;ITED = Iowa Test of Educational Development</i><br>
<i>&gt;PSAT = Preliminary SAT</i><br>
<i>&gt;CTMM = Calif. Test of Mental Maturity (IQ?)</i><br>
<p>
I remember taking ITED, but CTMM doesn't ring any bells.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, the point of this is that focus and attitude can have alot to </i><br>
<i>&gt;do with how well you score on these tests.  I dropped ten percentage </i><br>
<i>&gt;points after going through what I've labeled a 'psychedelic </i><br>
<i>&gt;singularity'.  I think I began ignoring alot of my classwork </i><br>
<i>&gt;(transcript grades reflect this) to study things not on the </i><br>
<i>&gt;curriculum, such as _The Essential Works of Anarchism_, radical </i><br>
<i>&gt;psychology (and other hip topics of that time), letting my verbal and </i><br>
<i>&gt;mathematical skills slip.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At that time I wasn't planning to go to college right away - I wanted </i><br>
<i>&gt;to "camp out on the land and set my soul free" - and computers were </i><br>
<i>&gt;just something that Big Brother (supposedly) used to control the </i><br>
<i>&gt;'oppressed masses'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Hehe.  Something similar happened to me.  I became disinterested in what I<br>
was being taught in high school (primarily because it was *so damn boring*)<br>
and studied, in great depth, things that I was interested in like AI, coding<br>
theory, high-energy physics, chemistry, etc.  It shows on my transcripts.<br>
Absurdly high test scores (usually perfect) and very average grades.  I<br>
always kind of wondered how universities interpret that kind of pattern.<br>
