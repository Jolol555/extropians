Eliezer, you offer us something you call "a measure of smartness",<br>
but you are not proposing any means of actually *measuring* anything.<br>
I'm really sorry, but this looks like hot air to me.<br>
<p>
Also, your talk of The Meaning of Life makes me uncomfortable. Life<br>
has many meanings, and I don't think they can all really be reduced<br>
to a single measure. I'd be prepared to look at arguments to the<br>
contrary, but any theory that makes such sweeping normative claims<br>
as yours does needs to come up with a measure of the proposed norm<br>
that is more than fancy rhetoric. Likewise, the more I look into<br>
the matter, the stronger grows my opinion that what we currently<br>
refer to as "smartness" or "intelligence" is a whole cluster of<br>
fundamentally distinct skills that we have yet to disentangle from<br>
one another. I expect that any one member of this bundle will be,<br>
perhaps, measurable someday, but that *value* or *meaning* is<br>
something that emerges only from the synergistic interaction of<br>
many such skills, knowledges, and microvalues and not something<br>
that can be identified with any one subcomponent.<br>
<p>
This may look like fuzzy-headed holism, but a lot of what has led<br>
me to these opinions has been my limited knowledge of techniques<br>
of benchmarking much simpler computational systems than human<br>
beings.  We don't even have a general benchmark of value for<br>
something as simple as a desktop workstation. If someone asks me<br>
to optimize a software system, I always have to ask them "Which<br>
axis would you like that optimized on?" Improving performance in<br>
one area of a complex system nearly always involves performance<br>
tradeoffs in some other area. *Global* improvements in very complex<br>
systems are so very difficult, that frankly I think most of them<br>
happen by accident (the hopeful monsters) and we preserve, study,<br>
and rationalize the accidents that work. But I'm no expert. If a<br>
*real* engineer (I'm not one) on the list wants to differ with my<br>
generalizations, I'd be interested in hearing about it.<br>
<p>
And of course, even as I assert that most significant technological<br>
advances happen by "chance" (or what Edison called "perspiration"),<br>
I also acknowledge that chance favors the prepared mind. (Where is<br>
that quote from?)<br>
