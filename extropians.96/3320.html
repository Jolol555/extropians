<i>&gt; Of course you could have had an intelligent society in the past </i><br>

<p>
Not if the evolution of intelligence involves using tools.  There is a <br>
complete lack of arrowheads, stone axes, and other such artifacts in the <br>
geological strata dating back to the era of dinosaurs.  <br>
<p>
Mark Crosby writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; there is a story I've mentioned before ...  by Amy Thomson, </i><br>
<i>&gt; _The Color of Distance_ (11/95), that examines an alien species </i><br>
<i>&gt; (on another planet)  called the Tendu that have evolved a mostly </i><br>
<i>&gt; non-mechanical but highly advanced biotechnical civilization. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Tendu did have a world-wide civilization but their artifacts </i><br>
<i>&gt; were all bio-degradable and would have left no traces for future </i><br>
<i>&gt; investigators had they become extinct or 'transcended'.</i><br>
<p>
Just because something is degradable doesn't mean it will degrade.  <br>
Wood is bio-degradable, but there is plenty of petrified wood.  <br>
Insects are bio-degradable, but entire insects are preserved in amber.  <br>
Leaves are bio-degradable, but there are fossilized leaves.  Even if   <br>
they did use bio-degradable materials, there would be lots of fossils.  <br>
A world-wide civilization would require large-scale structures such as  <br>
mines, harbors, canals, pipelines, and so forth, which would definitely <br>
leave some trace.  Besides, the concept of "biodegradablity" is an <br>
advanced concept that they would only arrive at after a long process of <br>
evolution.  When they first started using tools, they must have just used <br>
whatever came to hand.  <br>
<p>
I think the D. Sapiens scenario requires the intelligent dinosaurs to be <br>
confined to one small area; perhaps because the rest of the world was <br>
too hot and swampy for civilized life.  If they lived on an island near <br>
one of the poles, and if this island is now submerged (or was destroyed <br>
when the intelligent dinosaurs blew themselves up), then there would <br>
be no traces.  But this seems highly unlikely to me.  If they reached a <br>
level where they could transcend, or blow themselves up, then they <br>
could also colonize the rest of the world.  But apparently they didn't. <br>
<p>
So we arrive back at the Great Filter problem.  The dinosaurs lived on <br>
earth for millions of years, but never evolved into tool-using creatures.  <br>
Why?  <br>
<p>
Terence McKenna has suggested that when our ancestors discovered <br>
psychedelic mushrooms, that stimulated them to start thinking, talking, <br>
and using tools.  That was when they broke through the filter and <br>
started making progress.  Without mushrooms, we could have been <br>
stuck in an evolutionary cul de sac for eons, like the dinosaurs.  <br>
