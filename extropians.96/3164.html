What kind of deserts does the U.S. have, btw? Chile-type, Sahara-type, <br>
Gobi(ack!)-type? Is there a consensus, that these aride habitats should <br>
be substituted with something with more biomass/m^2 throughput?<br>

Current mainstream focuses on seawater desalination (reverse osmosis),<br>
together with an advanced irrigation technique to contain progressive <br>
soil salination. It would be interesting to combine this approach with<br>
enhanced surface shading/reflection by photovoltaics panels, using solar <br>
power to desalinate, while planting crops in the panels' shadows.<br>
<p>
What I quite never understood, why virtually nobody is using solar stills,<br>
long blackened trenches filled with slowly flowing seawater, covered with <br>
clear plastic planes (for condensation)? It has the additinal merit of <br>
producing destilled water, retaining most of the muck (and seawater nowadays <br>
carries a lot of filth). Of course, destillation is no barrier for methyl <br>
mercury &amp; Co...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, Chris is probably talking about "magically" importing </i><br>
<i>&gt; gigatonnes of waste to the entire desert all at once....</i><br>
<p>
I wonder what Lyeth ("Dune" desert ecologist) might have said to that <br>
one...<br>
