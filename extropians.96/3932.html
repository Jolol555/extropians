<i>&gt; I think some people are a bit put off by your arrogance, but not me, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I like arrogant people, I'm an arrogant bastard myself and it's always nice </i><br>
<i>&gt; to talk to a fellow member of the brotherhood.</i><br>
<p>
Working definition of the term "arrogance":  Self-righteousness<br>
manifesting as condescension and belief in one's own correctness.<br>
I try for a dry, un-self-righteous recognition of when my theories are<br>
right OR, in an unrelated observation, of when your theories are<br>
logically flawed.<br>
<p>
Working definition of "bastard":  A person who doesn't care when others<br>
are hurt.<br>
On occasion, I deem the truth to be more important than the feelings of<br>
others OR MYSELF, but that does not mean I don't care.<br>
<p>
Conclusion:  I am not an arrogant bastard, I was right all along, you're<br>
totally off the wall, and idiots like you shouldn't meddle in the<br>
affairs of their intellectual superiors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is nothing more relevant. If it were proved that we can not be run on a </i><br>
<i>&gt; Turing Machine then I would abandon my interest in Science and Mathematics </i><br>
<i>&gt; and become a Holly Roller. It would be the only logical thing to do.</i><br>
<p>
If somebody proved that consciousness required temporal or physical<br>
continuity as opposed to a discrete binary architecture, why would this<br>
have any religious implications?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We have only a hazy understanding of our motives and almost no </i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding of out individual cognitive architecture.</i><br>
Speak for yourself.<br>
<i>&gt; there is reason to </i><br>
<i>&gt; think that this ignorance about ourselves will not improve dramatically </i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of how intelligent we become.</i><br>
An Algernon wrote "Algernon's Law."<br>
<p>
And, the whole Halting Problem says nothing about my understanding how<br>
my mental architecture works, just my predicting what it will do.  I<br>
know how my computer works, but it still beats me at arithmetic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a different post on a different subject you indicated that you were </i><br>
<i>&gt; certain that a Quantum Computer will be built in the next 15 years.</i><br>
Not certain, since there could be a nuclear war.  But the things are SO<br>
damned useful and there's no theoretical reason why it shouldn't work. <br>
As I understand it, an STM should suffice for manufacturing the<br>
workhorse quantum dots.  We might have it by next year.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You also said you were certain that faster than light travel</i><br>
Sure.  General relativity says the speed of light is whatever I make it.<br>
<i>&gt; and Picotechnology were possible.</i><br>
Turing equivalence.  If there are computations being performed down<br>
there, why shouldn't we make use of them?  It's frightening how much<br>
computational power is being wasted every time *anything* macroscopic<br>
happens.<br>
