<p>
The typical Marxist's use of the word "alienate" is so sloppy,<br>
urgent, and confused that I can't get much out of it. They tend to<br>
confuse alienation from the product of ones labor (which *I* consider<br>
to be good, natural, healthy, and all that good stuff) with alienation<br>
from ones fellow human being (which I don't care for any more than<br>
they do), and so since they take as one bad thing what I take to<br>
be two different things, one good and one bad, it's hard for me to<br>
make sense of what they say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; i'm not denying that "commerce is natural", i'm only denying that</i><br>

<p>
Oh, I must have been confused then. No one thing is "all", so I can't<br>
possibly argue against your position if that's the entirety of your<br>
claim.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; eh? what's enlightened ?</i><br>
<p>
The sorts of people with whom one engages in purely and entirely<br>
noncommercial relationships. The sorts of people with whom you never<br>
worry which of you owns a particular item that might be of use to either<br>
of you. Most people in the world only consider their spouse or domestic<br>
partner "enlightened" in this sense. I was using the word half-jokingly,<br>
and I apologize if you found it confusing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; yup, although i don't think of the population of Uraguay in terms</i><br>
<i>&gt; of how i can make a profit from them.</i><br>
<p>
Why not? It goes both ways. The only way you could make a profit from<br>
them is if you did something of service toward them. I guess you're one<br>
of those egoists who never wants to be of service to anyone but yourself<br>
and your personal acquaintances.  ;)<br>
<p>
Oh, yeah, and please distinguish between the population of Uruguay and<br>
the government of Uruguay. It's easy (and frequently done) to make a<br>
profit by serving the government of Uruguay while badly disserving the<br>
people of Uruguay. But that's not profit: that's theft, usually<br>
committed in these cases by the government involved.<br>
