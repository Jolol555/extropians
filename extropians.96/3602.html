The point of programming is to tell the computer what to do.  Consider<br>
telling humans what to do.  Ever play charades?  Sometimes specific<br>
gestures or friends' telegrapy works well, but for general purposes we<br>
use language.  Similarly, for limited and related suites of applications<br>
some "drag and drop" or even pipelined (data streaming) development<br>
system can work well, but if you want the ability to tell the computer<br>
how to do anything, you need a language.  Or a best a visual system with<br>
the complexity of a language.<br>
<p>
Graphics can be good for showing data relationships, and certain types<br>
of connections.  We evolved to see things rather than put numbers<br>
together in our heads, so graphs are neater (and more manipulable) than<br>
columns of data points.  For directing complex systems, such as each<br>
other, we've evolved to use words and language.  This will probably<br>
continue to be true of computers.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, Visual C++'s resource editor is wonderful.  You want<br>
your GUI to look a certain way?  Edit the appearance, and your program's<br>
GUI will be changed to match.  Given that everyone is using menus and<br>
buttons and dialogs, it's a great timesaver.<br>
<p>

<p>
To whom?  There are people who can read and possibly write in straight<br>
hex machine code.<br>

On bad compiler days programming in assembler has its appeal.  Start all<br>

<p>
Hmm.  Graphical representation of a database of records; highlight a<br>
field to be the sort index, drag and drop "Quicksort"...<br>
<p>
But someone had to write "Quicksort". <br>
<p>
} &gt;Everybody (almost) agrees that the GUI is a better way to comunicate with a<br>
} &gt;computer than a command language. Everybody except system developers. Eh...<br>
<p>
Around here, programmers in general, and many people who don't program<br>
regularly as well, prefer command lines to GUIs, or at least want the<br>
option available.<br>
