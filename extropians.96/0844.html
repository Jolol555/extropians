<p>
<i>		&gt;you refer to the estimations in the retina chapter of "Mind </i><br>
<i>		&gt;Childeren"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
			       <br>
<i>		&gt;He [Moravec] made lots of arbitrary assumptions about neural </i><br>
<i>		&gt;circuitry collapsibility</i><br>
			       <br>
<p>
I don't think they were arbitrary, but I grant you some things were just <br>
educated  guesses, it turns out that he almost certainly overestimated the <br>
storage   capacity of the human brain. As for it's information processing <br>
capacity, he could be off by quite a lot and it would change the time the <br>
first AI is developed by very little. The speed of computation has increased <br>
by a factor of 1000 every 20 years. It might not continue at that frantic<br>
pace but ...<br>
		  <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;Considering about 1 MBit equivalent for storage for a single </i><br>
<i>		&gt;neuron </i><br>
		<br>
<p>
I think that's thousands of times too high. <br>
		  <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;8 bits/synapse, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A synapse may well be able to distinguish between 256 strength levels, <br>
perhaps more, Moravec said 10 bits/synapse, and in 1988 when he wrote his <br>
book it  was reasonable to think that if you multiplied 10 bits by the number <br>
of  synapses in the brain you could get a good estimate of the storage <br>
capacity  of the brain. It is no longer a reasonable assumption<br>
<p>
The most important storage mechanism of memory is thought to be Long Term  <br>
Potentiation ( LTP). It theorizes that memory is encoded by varying the <br>
strength of the 10^14 synapses that connect the 10^11 neurons in the human <br>
brain. It had been thought that LTP could be specified to a single synapse, <br>
so each synapse contained a unique and independent piece of memory, we now <br>
know that is not true. In the January  28 1994 issue of Science Dan Madison <br>
and Erin Schuman report that LTP spreads out to a large number of synapses on <br>
many different neurons. <br>
		 <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;a 10 k average connectivity </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A consensus number, although I have seen estimates as high as 100 k.<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;and about 1 kEvents/synapse,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Brain neurons seldom go above 100  firings a second, and at any one time  <br>
only 1% to 10% are firing in the brain.<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;assuming about 100*10^9 neurons, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sounds about right.<br>
<p>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;Moreover, this is _nonlocal_ MOPS </i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
I assume you're talking about long range chemical messages sent by neurons  <br>
to other neurons,  that would be one of the easier things  to duplicate. <br>
The information content in each molecular  message must be tiny, just a few <br>
bits. About 60 neurotransmitters are known but only a few of those, such as<br>
acetylcholine, are involved in long range signaling, even if the true number <br>
is 100 times greater ( or a million times for that matter) the information <br>
content of each signal must be minute . Also, exactly which neuron receives <br>
the signal is not critical ( it relies on diffusion, a random process) and <br>
it's as slow as molasses in February.<br>
<p>
If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small and <br>
your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the correct <br>
continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work done, then you <br>
don't have a very difficult profession. I see no reason why simulating that <br>
anachronism  would present the slightest difficulty.<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;I'd rather run at superrealtime, possibly significantly so. </i><br>
<i>		&gt;100* seems realistic, 1000* is stretching it. Nanoists claim </i><br>
<i>		&gt;10^6*, which is bogus.</i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
I think 10^9 would be closer to the mark. The signals in the brain move at <br>
10^2 meters per second or less, light moves at 3 X 10^8 and nano-machines   <br>
would be much smaller than neurons so the signal wouldn't have to travel <br>
nearly as far. Eventually the algorithms and procedures the brain uses could  <br>
be optimized and speed things up even more, but this would be more difficult.<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;no groundbreaking demonstration of such reversible logics </i><br>
<i>		&gt;has been done yet. </i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
Not so, reversible logic circuits have been built, see April 16 1993 Science. <br>
They're not much use yet because of their increased complexity, and with  <br>
components as big as they are now the energy you save by failing to destroy  <br>
information is tiny compared to more conventional losses. It will be  <br>
different when things get smaller. Ralph Merkle, the leader in the field is  <br>
quoted as saying " reversible logic will dominate in the 21'st century".<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;It bears about that many promise as quantum cryptography and </i><br>
<i>		&gt;quantum computers, imo. (Very little, if any).</i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
There is not the slightest doubt that quantum cryptography works, and not <br>
just  in the lab. Recently two banks in Switzerland exchanged financial <br>
information over a fiber optic cable across lake Geneva using Quantum <br>
Cryptography.  Whether it's  successful in the marketplace depends on how <br>
well it competes against public key cryptography, which is easier to use and <br>
probably almost as safe if you have a big enough key. I  don't want to talk <br>
about quantum computers quite yet, a lot has been happening in the last few <br>
weeks and I haven't finished my reading.<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;One tends always to forget that atoms ain't that little, at </i><br>
<i>		&gt;least in relation to most cellular structures.</i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
It's a good thing one tends to forget that, because it's not true. An average  <br>
cell has a volume of about 3 X 10^12 cubic nanometers, that's 3 thousand  <br>
billion. Just one cubic nanometer of diamond contains exactly 176 carbon  <br>
atoms.               <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>			      &gt;&gt;No known physical reason that would make it </i><br>
<i>			      &gt;&gt;[Nanotechnology] impossible.</i><br>
			      <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;No known physical reasons, indeed. </i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
I don't think there are any physical reasons why strong Nanotechnology is <br>
impossible, that's why I don't put it in the same category as faster than <br>
light flight, anti-gravity, picotechnology or time travel. If you disagree <br>
with my statement then I want to know exactly what law of physics it would <br>
violate,  not all the reasons that would make it difficult. I already know <br>
it's  difficult, that's why we haven't done it yet.<br>
		     <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;Just look at a diamondoid lattice from above, and look at </i><br>
<i>		&gt;the periode constant. When zigzagged, C-C  bond are a lot </i><br>
<i>		&gt;shorter. Sterical things.</i><br>
		     <br>
<p>
If something is pretty rigid, like diamond, it's steric properties are the <br>
same as it's shape properties, at least to a first approximation. Often <br>
steric difficulties can be overcome just be applying a little force and <br>
compressing  things a little. Naturally it is vital for a Nanotechnology <br>
engineer to  remember that no molecule is ever perfectly rigid and at very<br>
short distances  anything will look soft and flabby. Drexler is not ignoring <br>
this, he spends a  lot of time in Nanosystems talking about it.<br>
		<br>
<p>
<i>		   &gt;We want to know, whether a) a given structure can exist</i><br>
		<br>
<p>
It is possible that some of the intermediate states of the object you want to <br>
construct would not be stable. I can see two ways to get around this problem.   <br>
1) Always use a jig, even if you don't need it.  <br>
2) Make a test. If you know you put an atom at a certain place and now it's     <br>
mysteriously gone, put  another one there again and this time use scaffolding. <br>
Neither method would require a lot of intelligence or skills on the part of  <br>
the Nanotech machines.<br>
<p>
It's also theoretical possible that some exotic structures could not be built,  <br>
something that had to be complete before it's stable, like an arch, but <br>
unlike an arch had no room to put temporary scaffolding around it to keep <br>
things in place during construction. It's unlikely this is a serious <br>
limitation, nature can't build things like that either.          <br>
		   <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;b) whether we can build the first instance of this structure</i><br>
<p>
		   <br>
Assuming it can exist, (see above) the question of whether you can make it or <br>
not is depends entirely on your skill at engineering and has nothing to do  <br>
with science.      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>		&gt;c) this structure is sufficiently powerful to at least a </i><br>
<i>		&gt;make a sufficiently accurate copy of itself.</i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
Depends entirely on the particular structure you're talking about and on the <br>
particular environment it is expected to be working in. Again, this is pure  <br>
engineering.       <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>		&gt;That's a lot of constraints, and all of them physical. </i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
No, none of them are physical, all of them are engineering.<br>
<p>
		   <br>
<i>		&gt;Claiming the problems to be merely engineering, is not good </i><br>
<i>		&gt;marketing, imo.</i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
I wouldn't know, I'm no expert on marketing.<br>
		   <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;There are excellent reasons to suspect this connectivity </i><br>
<i>		&gt; [of neurons] to be crucial </i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
That's true, I don't think there is the slightest doubt. This vast <br>
connectivity is the very reason why biological brains are still much better  <br>
than today's electronic computers at most tasks, in spite of it's appallingly <br>
slow signal propagation.  <br>
		   <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt; so you have to simulate this connectivity. </i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
Obviously, and I see absolutely nothing in the laws of Physics that would <br>
forbid Nano Machines from equaling or exceeding this connectivity.<br>
		   <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;you can't do it directly in hardware </i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
Why not? The brain has a lot of connectivity, but a random neuron can't <br>
connect with any other random neuron, only the closest 10 thousand or so.    <br>
The brain grows new connections and I don't see why a machine couldn't do  <br>
that too if needed, but another way is to pre wire 10 thousand connections <br>
and then change their strength from zero to a maximum value.<br>
		   <br>
<p>
<i>		&gt;you must start sending bits, instead of pushing rods </i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
Eugene! I know you can't mean that. Using the same logic you could say that a  <br>
computer doesn't send bits, it just pushes electrons around, and the brain  <br>
doesn't deal in information, it just pushes sodium and potassium ions around  <br>
and Shakespeare didn't write plays, he just pushed ASCII characters around <br>
until the formed a particular sequence.<br>
