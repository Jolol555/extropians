I think that another big problem with this surveilance technology is<br>
that it is so easy to forge video, and it's getting constantly easier.<br>
With enough time and money you can make everybody do anything. How will<br>
you ensure when something was taped, if it has been edited, morphed,<br>
retouched or in any way altered. You only have to be avare of a camera<br>
to make use of it in your own interrest.<br>
<p>
Will cameras cover every concievable angle? How many cameras would that<br>
take? What would the storage reqirements be for that amont of video? How<br>
do we verify the content?<br>
<p>
If we started to depend on video for justice/truce we would see so many<br>
false examples that we wouldn't believe them anymore.<br>
<p>
A bulletproof surveilance society is not technical possible!!!! It's a<br>
downright stupid an uninformed idea. There will be more of it of course<br>
as everybody buys cameras and point them out of their windows. But total<br>
recall? Never!<br>
<p>
Beside that, the democracy rest upon the protection of the individual.<br>
How much is that protection worth if a minor group of persons cannot do<br>
something that's not *approved* by the majority. (Courtrooms exists,<br>
among other reasons, to prevent the majority from having complete<br>
control. If not it would be easier to fix societys problems with guns.)<br>
