As I noted in reply to Erik, perhaps we should encourage old List<br>
subscribers to repost (or add to the archives those of their posts that they<br>
think especially valuable.)<br>

Who refused to tell you? Maybe someone who didn't know! There's no secrecy<br>
involved, so your statement puzzles me.<br>
<p>

<p>
This was indeed one consideration. I agree with your comments. That's one<br>
reason why we decided to change things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. In some people's minds it allowed sending copyrighted material to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the list.  Since the list was "private", this was not "publishing".</i><br>
<i>&gt;This seemed dubious to me.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe that was a consideration for some people, but I don't think it a<br>
reason for our old policy. Certainly *I* didnt' think of that as a reason<br>
for it, and I don't recall anyone else in on the decision thinking that<br>
either. Umm, Your description does sound like Perry Metzger's line of<br>
thinking, and he originally started this list, though very soon turned it over.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do not think either of these advantages was the cause of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision.  The brief refusal to explain the history of the decision</i><br>
<i>&gt;mentioned AMIX (AMerican Information eXchange, now defunct), which</i><br>
<i>&gt;leads me to guess that there was an earlier time when the list was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;"private" and that someone tried to sell the archives of the list on</i><br>
<i>&gt;AMIX at that time.</i><br>
<p>
I don't recall anything like this. I don't think there was ever a time when<br>
the list was not considered private. Perhaps there were individuals who<br>
hoped to sell their restricted writings on AMIX, but that wasn't a policy of<br>
the List.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;History tends to repeat itself with more vigor when it is kept secret.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If my guess is right, then the current way of running the list is such</i><br>
<i>&gt;a repetition.  Is anyone who knows the history willing to speak up</i><br>
<i>&gt;now?</i><br>
<p>
I'm lost here. A repetition of what? The list has always been private, but<br>
now it's not. This is a change, not a repetition. Nothing about the history<br>
of the list or the reasons for it's policy is a secret.<br>
<p>
I encourage others involved in creating the old List policies to add their<br>
versions of what they remember.<br>
