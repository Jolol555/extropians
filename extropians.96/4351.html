&lt;Ever since I became a devout atheist ridding myself of the meme of <br>
christianity I've funneled my creativity into logic while stifling it. <br>

In case Lee Daniel Crocker's excellent advice didn't inspire you, <br>
here's another suggestion:<br>
Create a sculpture of yourself (so you can 'grasp' your creativity), <br>
put it in the center of a garden (so you can 'get back in touch with <br>
nature'), gather some worshippers around you (preferably 'creative <br>
people' and artists) - getting them to gather around you would <br>
certainly require some creative effort (perhaps you can foretell the <br>
future for them).  If this doesn't work, then you're bound to become <br>
depressed and, perhaps, get your creativity 'back' that way.  Looks <br>
like a win-win strategy; what have you got to lose?<br>

P.S. If at first you don't suceed, try try again!<br>
