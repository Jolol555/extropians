<p>
Any system, nano or macro, capable of creating microprocessors, <br>
will contain within it many human level-intelligences.  <br>
<p>
The "automated" factories that you speak of are only automated <br>
at one point in the manufacturing process.  The automated machinery <br>
is designed by engineers who understand its purpose, and who <br>
understand how their own jobs fit into the larger scheme of things.  <br>
The microprocessors themselves are designed by engineers who know <br>
what microprocessors are for, and who can talk, in human language, <br>
to the engineers who are designing the machines to be used in the <br>
automated factory.  <br>
<p>
The factories are part of a system which contains many human-level <br>
intelligences:  the managers, the accountants, the lawyers, the <br>
programmers who write the software that the other people use, the <br>
teachers who train the employees, the marketing people who sell the <br>
computers, the stockbrokers who sell stock in the company, and so <br>
forth.  All those people are part of the system.  They are all there <br>
for a reason.  The automated machinery could not exist without them.  <br>
<p>
If you substitute "agribusiness" for "manufacturing" in this discussion, <br>
the same principle still applies.  Instead of engineers you will have <br>
botanists, agronomists, biotechnicians, etc.  <br>
<p>
John continues:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Human judgment is not involved whenever one logic gate needs to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; connected to another, very dumb automatic process do it for us, </i><br>
<p>
I'm not saying human judgment is required at *every* point in the <br>
manufacturing system.  I'm saying that human judgment is required at <br>
*many* points.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we needed millions of pipelines we would find a way </i><br>
<i>&gt; to mass produce them too, </i><br>
<p>
Yes, and the same principle would apply to the mass production of <br>
pipelines, or anything else.  There are many points where a decision <br>
has to be made by somebody who has an understanding of the project <br>
as a whole, and who understands the purpose of his activity.  Such <br>
decisions require human judgment.  <br>
<p>
Have you ever worked on a construction site?  or in a factory, or a <br>
refinery, or any industrial enterprise?  I get the feeling that I'm talking <br>
to people who have spent most of their lives writing computer code, <br>
and have no sense of how the physical world works.  --But then, <br>
even a software project has to have somebody who understands <br>
what the software is for, and how it fits into the whole scheme of things.  <br>
Microsoft employs quite a few entities with human-level intelligence, <br>
and always will.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We know for sure that it's possible to manufacture </i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely complex objects, like human beings</i><br>
<p>
No.  To "manufacture" something means to make it to a specification.  <br>
Human beings are not manufactured to spec.  If they were, as in <br>
"Brave New World," a large staff of technicians and other employees <br>
would be required, just as in any other manufacturing system.  <br>
