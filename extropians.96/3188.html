The Past Hypothesis<br>
<p>
<p>
If Transhumans become capable of consciously creating universes which are very <br>
similar to our own, similar enough that they too develop intelligence and go <br>
on to create intelligent universes of their own, which do the same and so <br>
forth, then it will seem very likely to us that our universe was created by <br>
one or more conscious beings also.  As far as we know, we have not created any <br>
universes similar to our own or any at all, actually, so we don't have that <br>
reason to consider it likely that this universe was created by a conscious <br>
being.  But if this universe ever develops an intelligence which creates other <br>
universes which become intelligent and do the same, then it will seem likely <br>
that our universe was created this way as well.  This would be because those <br>
created universes would be very similar to ours, and since the universes this <br>
universe may create will have the property of being created by intelligence, <br>
then it will seem likely that our universe will have the same property.  Of <br>
course, even if we do start creating universes like ours, it's possible that <br>
ours is the first universe ever to develop.<br>
<p>
The idea that our universe was created intentionally by intelligence does not <br>
explain how the whole process got started in the first place; it just makes us <br>
wonder how the universe that created us was created and how whatever created <br>
that was created and so forth.  Some think that this weakness is enough to <br>
throw out the whole idea that our universe was created by intelligence.  Of <br>
course, the same argument could be used to declare that right now is the only <br>
moment in time that has ever existed, since to say that this moment is the <br>
result of previous moments is just a way of pushing the problem of where <br>
moments came from back one moment, and we must ask where that moment came from <br>
and so on, and our question is left unanswered.  Some people say that <br>
postulating the existence of a creator of this universe just adds an extra, <br>
complicating idea that doesn't really explain anything, so it should be <br>
rejected.  I would say that this same argument also applies to the idea that <br>
there is a past, that there are events prior to this one.  Postulating a past <br>
"does not explain anything.  It adds to the number of things to explain.  It's <br>
simply a speculation." (the quote is from Max More, referring to the God <br>
Hypothesis, but I think it also applies to the Past Hypothesis just as <br>
validly)<br>
<p>
Of course, there are some that will scoff at this notion that there is no <br>
past, but then many in the Dark Ages, and many still today scoff at the notion <br>
that there is no God.  But as a true skeptic, I demand evidence that there is <br>
a past.  Can you prove to me that there is a past?  Anything you show me I <br>
will witness in the present, and it won't be proof at all.  You have no real <br>
evidence there is a past.  All we're aware of is the present.  Even what we <br>
call "memories" are being experienced right now and should not be regarded as <br>
evidence for the past any more than thinking about God should be considered <br>
evidence for the existence of God.  But we're so indoctrinated to believe that <br>
there is a past, even though we have no empirical evidence at all for that <br>
hypothesis.<br>
<p>
Keeping this in mind, many of the arguments that are used to attack the God <br>
Hypothesis as an explanation for the universe can also be used to attack the <br>
Big Bang hypothesis or any other Origin of the Universe hypothesis.  Now, I'm <br>
not necessarily arguing in favor of the God Hypothesis, but I just wanted to <br>
make it clear that the same arguments that some people use to attack the God <br>
Hypothesis can also be used to attack the Past Hypothesis.  If using the Past <br>
Hypothesis helps you achieve your goals in life, then go ahead and use it, and <br>
if the God Hypothesis helps you achieve your goals in life, go ahead and use <br>
that as well.  It's none of MY business how you run your mind.<br>
