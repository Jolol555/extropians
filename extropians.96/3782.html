Wade Cherrington wrote about VRML virtual world-building on 12/7/96:<br>
<p>
&lt;Here are some ideas for possible "areas" or "locales"- <br>
- General background setting - cryogenic vaults, parkland walks, office<br>
"buildings" of various companies - nano/AI/software startups, private space<br>
launch, cryonics, nootropics, biotech, etc.<br>
- Memetic Agora - Idea futures with interactive, 3D interface. <br>
- General meeting places - seaside/starside cafes, pavillions, forest<br>
clearings<br>
- Transhumanist Art galleries - basically anywhere.  Also have utility for<br>
users to add there own "rooms", or personal areas.<br>
- Museum/Institute of Nanotechnology - animated nanobearings, molecular<br>
mechanics and nanosystem simulations, etc<br>
- Institute of complexity - Place to explore all sorts of Java applets<br>
dealing with fractals, a-life, cellular automata, genetic algorithms,<br>
evolutionary artwork, l-systems, neural networks, etc.<br>
- Other Institutes - Physics Demonstrations, Mathematics, cosmology,<br>
basically scientific visualization/multimedia.  A lot of this stuff is<br>
already out there, either offline or online -  it just needs to be brewed<br>
up<br>
with some Java and made pretty with VRML.<br>
- University/Academic - Libraries (links to hypertext, related resources<br>
all<br>
over the Web), lecture areas (real people "broadcasting" on a certain<br>
channel in a certain locale as in IRC's, but eventually with intelligent<br>
agents)    <br>
- Lyceums - Forums for scheduled debate, discussion - (Picture realtime<br>
brain-tennis with customized avatars)<br>
- "The Underground" - Places for people (like myself) that are into<br>
cryptoanarchy, temporary autonomous zones, agorist counter-economics,<br>
strong cryptography, untracable/untaxable digital e-cash, fall of states,<br>
CyberNexus, etc...&gt;<br>
<p>
This looks like my Christmas list!<br>
<p>
On another mailing list, I ran across some pertinent information about VRML<br>
&amp; Science, that may provide some links to funding and/or technical<br>
expertise.  I haven't visited the web site referenced below, so consider<br>
this to be blind passing of info. along, but it has Fred Hapgood's name<br>
embedded in it, a sometime contributor to this list, for what that's worth.<br>

DOCUMENT TITLE: Science Landscape<br>
<p>
SCIENCE LANDSCAPE MAY AID US INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, FUNDING AGENCIES,<br>
RESEARCHERS, AND LIBRARIES<br>
<p>
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Imagine the large-scale structure of science<br>
displayed as a landscape. That big mountain range with colorful peaks,<br>
ridges, and valleys is physics. Chemistry is a range off in the<br>
distance, and in another direction is, say, biology. Trails linking<br>
ranges are composite sciences like nuclear chemistry or molecular<br>
biology.<br>
<p>
The computerized landscape originally was conceived by scientists<br>
at Sandia National Laboratories to help US intelligence more easily<br>
track the thrust of research in countries of interest to the United<br>
States. The landscape's data management function can use open<br>
scientific literature to make visible the movement of nuclear and<br>
other military technologies across industries, countries, and regions.<br>
<p>
An expanded program will be made available to libraries, scientists<br>
and funding agencies to quickly find information about science, and<br>
is expected to pay for itself from licensing fees....<br>
<p>
LIBRARIES, RESEARCHERS, FUNDERS<br>
<p>
The expanded program will allow managers of funding agencies to watch<br>
peaks, ridges, hills and trails change contour and definition on<br>
a year-by-year basis, indicating research areas of increasing or<br>
diminishing scientific interest _ information helpful in determining<br>
which grant applications to fund, in what overall areas to invest<br>
for research and development, and how to improve investment<br>
strategies.<br>
<p>
Researchers using virtual reality techniques can fly over the<br>
landscape to see new sub-areas appearing and others merging or<br>
separating. By flying lower, researchers see more subcomponents of<br>
the region, and still lower, titles of the journal articles which form<br>
its substance....<br>
<p>
HOW IT WORKS<br>
<p>
Because article titles may differ eccentrically and key words have<br>
different meanings in different disciplines, the Sandia mapping<br>
algorithms cluster scientific papers by the number of citations that<br>
the papers list in common, rather than by their titles or key words.<br>
<p>
Citations are the collected footnotes that form the list, found at<br>
the end of almost every scientific paper, of previously published<br>
articles most critical to the current advance. The more citations<br>
two articles list in common and the more articles that cite them<br>
both, the more likely the research papers have a common focus, and<br>
the closer the landscape data points that represent them....<br>
<p>
The Sandia landscape prototype became operable in September. The<br>
computerized color image is created by newly derived algorithms fed<br>
citations from 30,000 articles published in analytic chemistry from<br>
1986 to 1996. By November, a landscape created by collating references <br>
from more than 3 million articles published over the last 18 years<br>
in a variety of sciences are expected to be organized in a huge<br>
supercomputer data matrix....<br>

-----<br>
<p>
Anyway, the landscape metaphor is very common in theoretical biophysics and<br>
evolutionary biology.  It is also very common in the arts.  It is a good<br>
cross-over (extropic) platform between very different semantic<br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
I would like to add to my Christmas list (that Wade kindly provided) a few<br>
extra virtual landscapes.  I fully support Natasha's idea of creating new<br>
forms of landscapes, the "liquid realm" material rightfully accompanying<br>
new extropic functions and designs.  I also have been very interested in<br>
the architectual settings prevalent at the roots of cultural development,<br>
with an eye towards the potential foundations of extropic cultural<br>
development.  The essential feature of such settings is that mechanisms<br>
existed to prevent the influx of external ideas arising from purely<br>
destructive intentions, allowing full and free fermentation of ideas in an<br>
atmosphere of civility (if not trust), while allowing totally free flow of<br>
ideas back out into the wider environment.  The problem of who the<br>
gate-keepers or bouncers will be and how they will operate has never been<br>
solved beyond the contingent needs of the moment, maybe there is no optimal<br>
solution.<br>
<p>
With this in mind, I'd nominate some approximations of such historically<br>
seminal centers of cultural development as: the Athenian Stoa, the Roman<br>
Forum, Lindisfarne, the medieval Fair at Troyes, Chartres Cathedral, Medici<br>
Florence, etc.<br>
<p>
Lastly on my wish list, I wish never to mistakenly wander into a VRML<br>
compost-modern cybermall, and I wish that my filters will have the capacity<br>
to block out tasteless avatar fashion.<br>
