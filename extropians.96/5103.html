<i>&gt; Though AM was pretty impressive for its time, I think further </i><br>
<i>&gt; investigation by grad students trying to reproduce Lenat's results</i><br>
<i>&gt; showed that the "new" theorems it produced were actually latent</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the heuristics that Lenat seeded the system with. Something like</i><br>
<i>&gt; "look for patterns when you divide integers by each other", then</i><br>
<i>&gt; presto, AM "discovers" prime numbers. </i><br>
<p>
I've heard that a lot, and judging by AM's source code, that's not the<br>
case.  The example you gave above, for example, is *impossible*, since<br>
AM didn't start out with the concept of "numbers", just set theory. <br>
"Numbers", to AM, are "bags-of-ones".  AM had heuristics like<br>
"investigate extreme cases".  Having built numbers from bags,<br>
multiplication from addition, and factoring from division, AM looked for<br>
extreme cases:  Numbers with zero, one, two, or three divisors.  It<br>
discovered that no numbers had zero factors, only one (1) had one<br>
factor, and that a set of numbers (later called "prime", but to AM,<br>
"bags-of-ones-with-two-inverse-of-multiplications" or whatever) had<br>
two.  It also investigated numbers with three divisors (squares) and<br>
numbers with *lots* of divisors.<br>
<p>
It is true that AM ran out of steam after a while; Lenat concluded that<br>
this was because AM's heuristics were inadequate.  So, after years of<br>
work, he came up with a system that could improve its own heuristics. <br>
It's called EURISKO, and it beat the living daylights out of humans in<br>
that trillion-credit-squadron game.<br>
