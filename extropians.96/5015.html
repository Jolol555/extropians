                 <br>
<p>
The atoms and electrons that make up the body are not "ours", we just rent  <br>
then, they're constantly changing, and anyway I don't see how doing the same  <br>
thing over and over would be immortality, it would certainly not make me fear  <br>
death any less. It would be like saying if I rerun a 2 hour movie 10 times<br>
then the movie lasts 20 hours. If you're going to be immortal you're going to  <br>
need to be able to think an infinite number of thoughts, that way regardless  <br>
of how the universe ends up, for you at least time will never end.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The other way is through use of the many-worlds theory.  If                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;there are near infinite universes than there must be one                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;where you continue on unaware that death has occurred in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;another world </i><br>
                  <br>
That might work, except for one thing. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;near infinite worlds if you wish to be technical but I like                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to simplify.              </i><br>
   <br>
<p>
If, as many think, not only does matter, energy, momentum and electric charge <br>
come in quantum packages, but space and time does too, then there can not be <br>
an infinite number of worlds, a typical irreversible macroscopic event would <br>
only produce about 10^(10^20) branches. There is not enough paper on planet <br>
earth to write such a number in decimal notation, but it's nowhere near to <br>
being infinite. That's the trouble with infinity, there are only 2 choices, <br>
either you're there or you're not even close.<br>
