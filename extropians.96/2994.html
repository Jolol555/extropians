This is a thread which I have REALLY TRIED to get started for QUITE SOME<br>
TIME. There are new technologies being explored which may lead to the<br>
ability for us to manipulate the weather across the globe. The lesser of<br>
the two major climate manipulation technologies can be accomplished by<br>
injecting large amounts of silver nitrate into the I-wall of a hurricane<br>
to dissolve it. The greater of the two is called HAARP. To sum things up,<br>
HAARP is about a military technology being developed in Alaska called<br>
High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in which you could<br>
create artificial satellites that you could bounce signals off of by<br>
heating sections of the atmosphere with a highly focused radiowave beam.<br>
This HAARP technology is in it's infancy so its possible that with a few<br>
breakthroughs in amplifying the power of the highly-focused radio beam,<br>
that we could ultimately control global climate by heating sections of<br>
the atmosphere in patterns to move moisture around. Technology like this<br>
could be used for the benefit of mankind by dissolving hurricanes before<br>
they make contact with coastlines or moving rain clouds into drought<br>
areas but it can also be used as an incredible weapon which is surely the<br>
reason for the US defense department having a hand in the development.<br>
Imagine if during the Gulf War we had the power to turn Iraq into an<br>
inland sea by using a technology like HAARP to create major flooding and<br>
literally destroy the country? Can we forsee ourselves manipulating<br>
global climate in, lets say the next 20 years? Is the United States<br>
responsible enough to use this type of power for the good of the people?<br>
Saving millions of dollars and thousands of lives? What possible side<br>
effects could occur? Should we take the risk?<br>
