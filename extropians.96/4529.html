Easy solution.  Make the more sophisticated algorithm routine.  Make it<br>
modular, so RSA or IDEA can be easily replaced if needed, later.  I<br>

building in RC4 would.  If this would be inconvenient, well, maybe it's<br>
worth it.  Besides, predictable improvements should last long enough so<br>
that continuous encryption is fairly feasible; those same improvements<br>
won't help NSA or criminal crackers one bit.  Well, some bits, but not<br>
nearly enough.<br>

Actually I was told that RC4 _isn't_ totally white; that the cypherpunks<br>
et al. were gleeful when this was discovered "Ha!  This will show RSA<br>
Inc. to allow public criticism!" and were subsequently confounded when<br>
the skew in the output proved to be almost worthless in helping to break<br>
