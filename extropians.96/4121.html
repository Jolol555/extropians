On the theory that SSRIs haven't been done to death here before my <br>
time:<br>
As I'm sure Romana and others know, the "serotonin re-uptake" part of<br>
the SSRIs is most of what the SSRIs have in common. Many also tweak<br>
one or more other neurotransmitter levels, so can have widely varied<br>
effects.<br>
<p>
Besides Paxil and Prozac, there are also Effexor and Wellbutrin; I've heard <br>
of people who take one or the other of those and (in some cases) augment <br>
with occasional doses of a meso(cortico)limbic dopamine enhancement of <br>
one sort or another.<br>
<p>
I don't have a whole lot of info on Deprenyl, but it apparently has <br>
serotonin and dopamine effects. I am curious about this, but haven't <br>
pursued it much yet.<br>
<p>
Now, the donwsides certainly can include changes in thinking,<br>
affect flattening, changes in sleep patterns, libido, etc. Combine <br>
those with old (and _effective_) habits learned during the old <br>
chemical regime, and it's clear that hillclimbing the hedonic <br>
landscape is fraught with pitfalls. As one acquaintance put it, "Some <br>
people call it my manic phase... I like to call it 'getting things <br>
DONE!'". :)<br>
