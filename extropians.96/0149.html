Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil is a disordered substance, thus having no <br>
preferred direction in its detonation. Unless the geometry of the bomb is <br>
such that it channels the blast wave, wouldn't the applied force be pretty <br>
much isotropic?<br>

<p>
The analysis is correct for free standing columns, since the only bending <br>
moments are due to the difference in applied pressure along the beam. <br>
However in a building, the connection to the floors provides bending fulcrums <br>
which allow part of the concrete to be put in tension, causing the concrete to <br>
break since it has little tensile strength. The connections to outside concrete<br>
walls provide broad surfaces for the blast pressure to act over that couple <br>
fairly well to the columns. The reinforcing iron is started bending as well, <br>
and having lost the compression bearing structure of the concrete, then <br>
buckles under the weight of the upper floors. The explosive doesn't have to <br>
have the impulse to sever the beams, it undermines them and the weight of the <br>
upper floors does the rest. During the falling of a building, some of the <br>
re-bars will be placed under tremendous tension, and sheared along their width. <br>
That damage looks superficially similiar to the tearing produced by a nearby <br>
charge of high explosive along one side of the beam.<br>
<p>
I can't rule out what Partin is saying, but I'm offering a known<br>
damage mechanism that could reasonably produce a similiar effect<br>
without needing to invoke conspiracies.<br>
