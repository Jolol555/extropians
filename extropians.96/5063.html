<i>&gt; discussion of these issues.</i><br>
<p>
I think that mutual transparency is worth exploring and is slowly<br>
becoming more present in the world. I base my personal relationships on<br>
this principle and the more transparent we are to one another, the more<br>
mutual trust. In my POV, trust is essential to happiness and comfort, as<br>
well as having things work well together.<br>
<p>
There are fascinating possibilities here. For example, politics. Suppose<br>
that any holder of public office is *required* to be completely<br>
transparent, ie, allow total 24 hour surveillance of their lives, with<br>
this information available to all who request it. In such an environment<br>
it might dawn on the pols that candor and honesty work better than<br>
deceit. Note that we already have the means to do this, albeit for a<br>
limited number of people. Let's start with the president and all of the<br>
congresscritters....<br>
