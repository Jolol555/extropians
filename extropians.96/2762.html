Michael Lorrey wrote to me, "You erroneously assume that every human has as <br>
much trouble<br>
communicating their thoughts as you do."<br>
<p>
All my life, I have seen people having a great deal of trouble communicating <br>
with each other.  I saw it in school, when my fellow students would ask the <br>
teachers questions, and a great deal of the time, the teacher wouldn't <br>
understand what they were asking or else think they were asking something <br>
else, and so they would answer very inadequately, leaving the student baffled. <br>
 I understood exactly what my fellow students were asking, and I understood <br>
how the teachers misinterpreted them.  I have seen miscommunication like this <br>
all my life.  I often act as a mediator between people who are talking to each <br>
other but can't understand each other, even though they are both fluent <br>
speakers of English.  One person says something, and the other is baffled, and <br>
I restate it for them in better terms, and the person they are talking to <br>
understands.  I'm often saying, "What he's trying to say is..."<br>
<p>
I am actually a far better communicator than most humans.  Most humans have <br>
much more trouble expressing things than I do.  My assumption is not in error. <br>
 Humans DO have a difficult time communicating with each other, except about <br>
certain, limited topics.<br>
