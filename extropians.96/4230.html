<i>&gt; In fact, I would assume that</i><br>

<i>&gt; persuasive meme or they wouldn't be working. Of course, it is true that such a</i><br>

<i>&gt; qualities of individuals. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I have given this matter some consideration, and I think the reason that<br>
a "chain letter resistant" meme has started to spread is because the<br>
basic nature of a chain letter is to attach a meme of any type to a<br>
Parasitic Class meme. The "copy me" meme is a fairly benign and easily<br>
resisted parasite by itself but when the usual superstitions are added<br>
in ("Break the chain and bad luck follows.") it becomes more persuasive.<br>
<p>
The natural reaction of a meme construct (a mind) to defend itself<br>
against parasites comes into play when a parasitic meme is detected by<br>
its self aware processes. When a catchy tune or advertising jingle is<br>
making its way through the population you will sometimes find people<br>
saying "Don't humm that around me, it gets stuck in my head!" The same<br>
process is at work here. People read one chain letter, and find<br>
themselves thinking "What if the bad luck part is true? Its so easy to<br>
copy it and send it to friends..." Then, sometimes, a self aware<br>
processes kick in before they act, and says "You idiot, it's a parasite!<br>
Don't read anymore of these chain letters, and tell your friends not to<br>
send them!" From then on, the content is ignored when such blatant<br>
parasitic replication is recognized, and the sender gets scolded.<br>
<p>
I would love to see a world where every mind recognizes that all ideas<br>
are replicaters and simply analyzes them for symbiotic content before<br>
hosting them. Such minds would recognize parasitic memes for what they<br>
are, but could also disentangle symbiotic information from a parasitic<br>
carrier. I grant that most memes carried by such a parasite are<br>
themselves parasitic, because good symbiotes don't usually need to<br>
evolve such vehicles. Still I think people should be aware of the nature<br>
of their basic ideological imuno-reactions, and be able to suppress them<br>
when it is beneficial.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Just thought about the possibilities and came up with the following idea.</i><br>
<i>&gt; How about *using* the chain letter approach to reward people for propagating an</i><br>
<i>&gt; important idea or other piece of information which we find highly valuable to</i><br>
<i>&gt; spread (say, my Prometheus Project information). It would work this way. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; start the letter which contains the information which I which to propagate and</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the bottom states, that if you cross off the first name on the list, add</i><br>
<i>&gt; your own to the bottom, and send me the name that was at the top of the list. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; will pay that person (say between $0.50 and $1.00) for each time that I receive</i><br>
<i>&gt; his name. Apart from the fact that most people (especially the ones that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would want to attract) are *so* against chain letters that they would not even</i><br>
<i>&gt; begin to read it (unless they don't realize until the end that it is a chain</i><br>
<i>&gt; letter), what do readers think of this idea?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
To avoid the imuno-reaction, you might want to disguise the chain letter<br>
aspect of it more. I have simply offered clients 5% of my profits on any<br>
new clients they bring to me with some degree of success. As long as you<br>
don't specifically say "Send this to 10 friends!", you may not trigger<br>
the wrong reaction.<br>
