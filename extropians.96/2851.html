<p>
I approve. In every day activities, I think in French, but, when I work<br>
with computers, I use English as a language of thoughts. I can't do it <br>
the other way around.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What worries (and inspires) me </i><br>
<i>&gt;the most about language is that it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;basic nature hasn't changed in thousands</i><br>
<i>&gt;of years, we still link idea </i><br>
<i>&gt;packages (words) to each other in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;linear fashion.</i><br>
<p>
Languages, like French, English, etc., haven't changed subtantialy<br>
in the last century althought our vision of the world changed very <br>
much. Those languages don't correspond anymore to our contempory <br>
paradigms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;After all language is our </i><br>
<i>&gt;primary popular method for </i><br>
<i>&gt;abstracting reality (ignoring </i><br>
<i>&gt;for a moment specialist </i><br>
<i>&gt;languages like maths).  </i><br>
<p>
[Abstract: remove from, separate]<br>
<p>
The primary abstration of reality is made when we perceive the outside<br>
world. We see, smell, hear, feel, etc. only a sample of what is out there.<br>
Then we arrange the perceived world in a collection of objects, give <br>
meaning and relationship to those objects. And, only then, we translate <br>
it to a language.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Another huge leap in improving </i><br>
<i>&gt;communication will happen when </i><br>
<i>&gt;we start using VR technology as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;comm. tool by writing in 3D.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not so sure of that. A researcher at Palo Alto's research center <br>
told to Wired Magazine:<br>
<p>
   "In its ultimate environment, VR causes the<br>
   computer to become effectively invisible by taking over the human<br>
   sensory and affector systems. VR is extremely useful in scientific<br>
   visualization and entertainment, and will be very significant for<br>
   those niches. But as a tool for productively changing everyone's<br>
   relationship to computation, it has two crucial flaws. First, at the<br>
   present time [1992], and probably for decades, it cannot produce a<br>
   simulation of significant verisimilitude at reasonable cost. That<br>
   means that users will not be fooled and the computer will not be out<br>
   of the way. Second, and most importantly, it has the goal of fooling<br>
   the user - of leaving the everyday physical world behind. This is at<br>
   odds with the goal of better integrating the computer into human<br>
   activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world."<br>
<p>
                         [WIRED 2.02: "PARC Is Back!" by Howard Rheingold]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As more of our communication moves </i><br>
<i>&gt;to the electronic platform, </i><br>
<i>&gt;written speech will become less </i><br>
<i>&gt;important, less productive and more </i><br>
<i>&gt;of a subset of communication </i><br>
<i>&gt;than it's very backbone.  </i><br>
<p>
When telephone was invented, many predicted that mail would disapear.<br>
It didn't.<br>
<p>
When radio was invented, many predicted that newspapers and books would <br>
disapear. It didn't.<br>
<p>
Now that numerical communication appears, you predict that written <br>
communication will fade away. I'm septic.<br>
<p>
I never wrote so much since I use a computer!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Parallel-non linear languages </i><br>
<i>&gt;will free                                       </i><br>
<i>&gt;our minds from a thousands year old </i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking paradigm, making </i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking and communicating</i><br>
<i>&gt;a much more liquid experience</i><br>
<p>
It seems to me that communication tend to be more a serial process than<br>
thinking (or thinking more parallel than communicating). Ideally, we should have<br>
specific languages for communicating and different ones for thinking.<br>
