This statement is not self-evident.  Defend it.<br>

<p>
The current economy is *not* driven by raw physical production economy<br>
efficiencies.  There are also costs to retool for new products, to<br>
invent products, to market them, etc.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;With MNT, all I need to produce an item is the design for the item,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and matter, and energy. This means that any individual who so desires</i><br>
<i>&gt;can drop out of the global economy and revert to a "subsistence</i><br>
<i>&gt;lifestyle" with material self-sufficiency. </i><br>
<p>
If the population explodes (such as with uploads) there may not be<br>
enough land and sunlight for everyone to do this.  Or drop outs may<br>
not have their property rights respected if their military technology <br>
is far below par.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That lifestyle will be very lavish by today's standards.</i><br>
<p>
But it may be very poor compared to not dropping out.  <br>
You and I could now go try to live as mountain men, after all.<br>
Which isn't a bad life by historical standards (now that even mountain<br>
men can afford guns, flashlights, etc.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suppose that an economy in these three inputs (design info, matter,</i><br>
<i>&gt;energy) could in principle emerge, but not in time to avoid a complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;meltdown of the existing economy. </i><br>
<p>
This all depends on the speed of change.  Why would it be that fast?<br>
