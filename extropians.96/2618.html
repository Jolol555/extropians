This delay is not a minor engineering consideration, it is built into the <br>
very fabric of the universe. If information could not work in a physical  <br>
context it would be a useless concept. Information is not a useless concept.<br>

I've never heard of the "Information can not be moved only copied" Theorem <br>
and I am not totally ignorant in such matters, but if it really exists please  <br>
tell me exactly what it means. Why it is concrete and practical if as you say <br>
it has nothing to do with "the physical context"? How would our physical <br>
Universe be the slightest bit different if it were untrue? <br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;information agent.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I not sure I know what you mean by "synchronized", but it is true that Godel   <br>
proved in 1930 that any mathematical system with a finite number of axioms <br>
will be inconsistent or incomplete, some things are just undecideable. For a <br>
few years after Godel made his discovery it was hoped that we could at least  <br>
identify those undecideable things, that is, statements that were either <br>
false or true but had no proof. If we could do that then we would know we <br>
were  wasting our time looking for a proof and we could move on to other <br>
things, but in 1935 Turing proved that sometimes even that was impossible.<br>

Exactly, and in a fast upload my consciousness wouldn't even be interrupted, <br>
I wouldn't even know anything unusual was happening.<br>

I'm delighted you uses the term "mechanism", a mechanism works by physical  <br>
laws not magic, we can experiment on a mechanism, we can see how it works,  <br>
we can duplicate a mechanism.<br>

Huh?? This mechanism finds a difference between 2 blocks of information that  <br>
you admit have no differences! How on earth does it manage to do that? <br>
What does it even mean?<br>

If the 2 atoms look and act exactly the same then you could exchange them and <br>
it would make no difference. Atoms have no individuality, if they can't even  <br>
give themselves this property how can they give it to us? <br>
