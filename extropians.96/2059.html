        I really think age is irrelevant on this list.  For one, the list is<br>
a forum for extropian conversation; I have a feeling some peoples' views may<br>
be frowned upon by others if they know the poster's age.  If there was a 15<br>
year-old on this list, some members might think that that person had not<br>
experienced the world or had not been involved enough to know anything about<br>
extropianism.  On the other side of the spectrum, if there was a 75 year-old<br>
on this list, members might feel that he\she has no chance of uploading,<br>
therefore his\her views are inconsequential.  These are most certainly not<br>
*my* views in particular...I am neither of those ages...but past experience<br>
has shown me how judgmental people tend<br>
to be when faced with an age.  As long as their topics are extropian, I<br>
wouldn't care if there were 10 year-olds on the list.  Enough said!<br>
