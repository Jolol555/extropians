After reading my post on the unlikelyhood of "universal translators" and being <br>
able to communicate with aliens, and a brief explaination of the basis for <br>
human communication, Michael Lorrey commented: <br>
<p>
"Sorry Dave, that sounds like psychomystical claptrap to me. The fact is that <br>
using mathematics, and our knowledge of the physical laws, we already have a <br>
Rosetta Stone to relate with any technological society of aliens. If they were <br>
non technological, I'm not sure it would be so easy. The fact that we would be <br>
two intelligent races with scientists<br>
makes for a huge overlap of common ground from which to build greater <br>
communication."<br>
<p>
First of all, what aspects of my post make it sound like "psychomystical <br>
claptrap"?  I think the concept of resonance between systems (broadly meaning <br>
that they cause each other to behave similarly) is a farily scientific concept <br>
(tuning forks are the classic example).  The idea the humans mimic each other <br>
is a matter of observable fact.  I don't see anything in my post that I would <br>
imagine someone could see as "psychomystical claptrap".  <br>
<p>
I understand what you're saying about the Rosetta Stone and using our common <br>
base of scientific knowledge to develop forms of communication with aliens.  <br>
However, I can conceive of possible alien beings who are technologically <br>
advanced and who have a very good understanding of the regularities of the <br>
universe (the knowledge that we discover through science), but whose concepts <br>
and ways of thinking are still profoundly different than ours.  I am thinking <br>
that our way of doing science and finding out how the universe works is only <br>
one of many ways to approach understanding the universe.  It may be that our <br>
science is simply a way that is especially well suited to the human brain.  <br>
<p>
I imagine that alien beings would have developed their own, unique ways of <br>
developing accurate knowledge, which would likely be profoundly different from <br>
our own.  They may come to understand the various properties of the different <br>
elements and learn how to take advantage of those properties, but the way they <br>
organize their knowledge and represent it to each other may be quite <br>
profoundly different from our Periodic Table of the Elements.  It makes sense <br>
to us to arrange all the elements on a chart, grouped according to similar <br>
properties and in order of atomic weight, but it only makes sense because of <br>
the particular ways that we have developed to think about things.  Evolution <br>
on a different planet would likely yield intelligent beings with very <br>
different ways of thinking about things and approaching things.<br>
<p>
Humans seem to have a hard time imagining that intelligent beings might think <br>
in ways profoundly different than we do.  We tend to think that our way of <br>
intelligence is the only way.  It's difficult to imagine other ways of <br>
thinking; they are too alien to our minds.  Humans also tend to  imagine that <br>
intelligent aliens will be humanoid in shape, or something reasonably similar. <br>
 We have a hard time imagining intelligent beings in shapes *very* different <br>
than our own.<br>
<p>
Then there's the question of how the aliens would likely communicate with each <br>
other.  Would they vibrate the air, like we do?  Perhaps they would make <br>
intricate bodily movements and use some kind of sonar to observe each other <br>
move.  Perhaps they will have ways of communicating massive amounts of <br>
information in parallel, rather than in a stream, like we do.  Maybe they will <br>
have developed some sort of technology so that they stimulate each other's <br>
minds more directly, and their communications would be so subtle that we would <br>
consider it telepathy.  Their forms of communication may be so profoundly <br>
different than ours, and their ways of representing knowledge in their minds <br>
may be so profoundly different, that even if they understand the basic <br>
properties of the universe to the degree we do and have the same basic <br>
knowledge, we wouldn't be able to recognize how they've encoded that knowledge <br>
because we wouldn't understand how they even communicate knowledge to each <br>
other.  If their knowledge is being communicated between each of the aliens by <br>
subtle technological links between their minds, then it would be very <br>
difficult to understand the workings of their communication devices, which <br>
would most likely be almost seamlessly integrated with their cognitive organs.<br>
<p>
Yeah, if they had a periodic chart written down somewhere, then we could <br>
compare it with ours and understand a little of their language, but what if <br>
they don't write anything down?  What if all their communication is <br>
"telepathic"?  How do we crack into their communication systems to even have a <br>
start at understanding the information that they are passing back and forth?  <br>
And then how do we understand what they're "talking" about?  Maybe each of <br>
them has all the properties of physical matter memorized, so they no longer <br>
talk about it; they just refer to that set of knowledge with arbitrary <br>
symbols.  Then we would never see their scientific knowledge being <br>
communicated between them, only arbitrary symbols that are meaningful only to <br>
the aliens themselves.  <br>
<p>
To communicate with them, we have to understand the ways they link concepts <br>
together and what symbols they use to represent which concepts. This is likely <br>
to be as much of an evolved and tangled mess as human thinking and human <br>
language.  I don't think we would have much hope of untangling their mess of <br>
concepts and symbols if we ever met an alien species.<br>
<p>
Language is an evolved technological device, with symbols pointing to various <br>
concepts, which are linked to other concepts with varying degrees of fuzziness <br>
inside each individual's mind.  Language grows as we invent new symbols to <br>
point to our shared concepts and develop new fuzzy links between concepts.  <br>
Language grows and evolves very much like an organism.  Minor mutations are <br>
constantly being made to the symbolic structure.  It's also very much like a <br>
computer program that keeps getting added to and changed here and there until <br>
it is almost unrecognizable compared to what it was and is very complex and <br>
messy.<br>
<p>
<p>
Michael asks, "Who ever said that humans have a  "low" level of <br>
communication?"<br>
<p>
I did.  It was right in my post.  Did you not see it? :-)<br>
<p>
Humans DO have a low level of communication.  Most of the activities and <br>
thoughts occurring in our brains have no representation in our languages.  We <br>
can look at the sky, but can we communicate the color blue?  No; we can only <br>
refer the person we are talking to, to their experience of the color blue.  <br>
When we're communicating with each other, we're basically referring each other <br>
to common, similar memories and experiences.  We can only really communicate <br>
about common experiences and concepts.  <br>
<p>
Also, it is extremely difficult for us to communicate with each other about <br>
experiences we have in common but which haven't been talked about before, so <br>
no symbols have been developed yet to represent that common experience.  <br>
Various bodily sensations and nuances of emotion are common, mutual <br>
experiences for which we haven't yet developed symbols, and so we cannot <br>
really communicate with each other about these experiences, because we don't <br>
know what sounds or images to make to get the other person to remember the <br>
experience we are wanting to refer them to.<br>
<p>
Most of our thoughts have to do mainly with our own specific, individual <br>
memories and experiencs, and these thoughts cannot be shared through language <br>
because only the individual thinking them has the proper background (memories) <br>
to understand those thoughts. <br>
<p>
Do you understand what I am saying?  It's very difficult to communicate these <br>
ideas well.  Especially since I don't know how much background you have in <br>
these areas, and I don't know how much to explain and how much to assume you <br>
already know.  I also don't know how you think about things and link up <br>
concepts, so I don't know if I'm triggering off your concepts in the proper <br>
order so that you form the links that I am trying to get you to form with this <br>
communication.<br>
<p>
Effective communication is very difficult to achieve between humans.  It is an <br>
art that requires much training and practice.  <br>

P.S.  E. Shaun Russell, you wanted to start a thread on semantics.  This is it <br>
(in case you didn't notice).<br>
