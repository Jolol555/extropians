<i>&gt;&gt;I'm open to suggestions though.</i><br>
<p>
[I see that people who were on the list before it was open are concerned with<br>
keeping this forum's value, and, being new, I repsect that wish, also,being<br>
new, I wonder if I have in anyway contributed to the lack of quality...<br>
however I cannot know because the comments about "junk"  are generalized, no<br>
one has said who posts the "junk" or what catagorical "junk" is specifically,<br>
as opposed to quality.<br>
     The process which is being suggested is removed from anything I would be<br>
able to participate in ( being a new person, who joined after the list opened<br>
up). Please accept my comments in that observational, suggestive, uninvolved<br>
light. ]<br>
***<br>
         I have been thinking about the original post about a senior member<br>
group that juries our most recent posts and decides who can post  and<br>
suggestions of a second list for the inferior.<br>
I think that perhaps Max opening up the list ( which will certainly attract<br>
more and more new and diverse and unknown  people)  may  at *first* have the<br>
effect of disturbing the original quality earlier flow of ideas.  <br>
Perhaps one will find that as people stay or dont-or learn and become more<br>
articulate and knowledgeable -  we may find the list getting back to it's<br>
original quality without a committee... <br>
: )<br>
<p>
Self ownership.<br>
I am not sure that limiting *who* is on would be better than addressing the<br>
*content* of what is written , directly , specifically and at the time of<br>
posting.<br>
<p>
I will certainly do my best not to write "junk." I APOLOGIZE IF I HAVE, BUT<br>
NO ONE HAS TOLD ME, AND SO I WOULDNT BE PRONE TO CORRECT IT IF SO.<br>
<p>
I suggest that people who are aware of what "high quality " is might take<br>
responsibility to make it known to those who aren't pleasing you, telling<br>
them when and where this "junk" occurs, at the time, and instead of forming a<br>
censorship bureau. This could  could be done politely and internally, by<br>
posting a private email or by speaking up directly onto the list.<br>
<p>
It might take some time and effort, but not nearly as much as reading every<br>
single member's last five  posts and making the difficult group decision who<br>
can and can't participate in the forum.<br>
<p>
Spontaneous Order.<br>
 I would hate to see a ruling collective of the Extropian list....<br>
<p>
( For one thing, It s not exactly like there are millions and millions of<br>
Extropians( YET), and two simultaneuos ( one "those of good quality" , one<br>
for the "post challenged" ) lists seems a bit hard to imagine. And who would<br>
want to be on the inferior list? )<br>
This is just my HO, i am not into discussing how to control others.<br>
I am here to learn and grow and hope to contribute to an Extropian future. I<br>
have also dropped off the transhuman list, partly because of white noise,<br>
rudeness and squabbling, but mostly to reclaim the useful time required to<br>
read it.<br>
I have opted to stay on this one so far.<br>
<p>
Sigh.....of course the list will do whatever seems right, if it becomes<br>
subject to a committee, and/or  divides into two lists, I will voluntarily<br>
withdraw, because I cannot imagine myself wanting to participate in either<br>
list.<br>
Cheers. : )<br>
