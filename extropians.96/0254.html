Sarah: You raise a good point. However -- no, I am not defining S.O. on the<br>
basis of its desirability from an extropic point of view. Extropians tend to<br>
like the idea of S.O. because they are so valuable in social coordination.<br>
This does not mean that all S.O.'s are to be judged good from an extropic<br>
point of view. Their desirability is not part of their definition or<br>
conditions for being distinguished from centrally-realized orders.<br>
<p>
If you read my "Order Without Orderers" in Extropy #7 (I should add it to my<br>
Web site soon) you'll see that I do grant a major place for non-spontaneous<br>
orders. Both kinds have their place (corporate structures have major<br>
elements of planned order for example). S.O.s are especially valuable when<br>
it comes to economies and societies as a whole. S.O.'s can contain within<br>
themselves valuable planned orders. Precisely in which situations one kind<br>
of order is preferable to another -- or what mix of each on any level is<br>
desirable -- is a fascinating question.<br>
