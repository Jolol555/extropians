There is no "they," at least not yet.  I don't know of any Christians <br>
who think in such terms.  But now that the idea has been proposed, <br>
somebody will pick up on it, inevitably.  A new church will appear, <br>
with the explicit aim of making the Apocalypse happen.  They will <br>
declare themselves to be the only true church, and they will regard <br>
anti-scientific "Christians" like your parents as clueless and irrelevant.  <br>
<p>
One of the cliches that permeates modern culture is the idea that <br>
Christianity is inherently anti-scientific.  Nothing could be more <br>
absurd.  Out of all the cultures that have existed on this planet, only one <br>
created modern science.  Science appeared in Europe, at a time when <br>
virtually all Europeans were Christian.  Pascal, Newton, Leibniz, Euler, <br>
Cauchy, and Riemann were all Christians -- and not just nominal <br>
Christians.  They took it seriously.  Show me six atheists with <br>
comparable mathematical achievement.  Show me an atheistic culture <br>
that has produced any non-trivial scientific ideas.  Even Galileo, <br>
who was arrested by the Inquisition, remained a Christian all his life; <br>
his quarrel was with the ecclesiastical bureaucracy, not with the church  <br>
per se.  <br>
<p>
What we call the "singularity" (for lack of a better term) will not <br>
happen by accident.  It will be brought about by someone who intends <br>
to bring it about, and that person will be fully aware that the very idea <br>
of the "singularity" has its roots in the Bible.  <br>
