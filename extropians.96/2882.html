&lt;What do you mean, the Powers can't operate at our level except through us? <br>
 [snip] A genuine Power wouldn't be stopped by the Zones [snip] and would <br>

<p>
Zones are about boundaries, things like solar systems, galaxies, clusters, <br>
possibly black holes at the center of galaxies.  For *your* Powers to <br>
"rewrite the Zones", it sounds like even intelligent galaxies are mere ants <br>
to be crushed under Their feet!<br>
<p>
&lt;The most unrealistic part of A Fire Upon The Deep wasn't the Zones. [snip] <br>
The unrealistic part is Vinge claiming that there's something the Powers <br>
don't know about.  That's just ridiculous, wildly impossible...&gt;<br>
<p>
It appears that you want only Powers ascribed to Omega, anything less, any <br>
intermediate level (like Jupiter-size brains or gallactic minds) is "just <br>
ridiculous, wildly impossible"!!??<br>
<p>
&lt;The Powers, our future selves, will be smarter than we are.  They will be <br>
able to do anything we can and a hell of a lot more.  There is nothing they <br>
will forget that we know, no problem we can solve that they can't.  Don't <br>
forget that.&gt;<br>
<p>
Even with the unlimited memory you imply for your Powers (BTW, what would <br>
be the point of having more than one of these all-knowing beings?), even if <br>
they are able to immediately view anything they ever knew, why should they <br>
remember anything that we know now? WE were once embryos and (most) <br>
remember nothing from that time.  A galactic brain, for example, is no more <br>
going to 'remember' a single planet than we 'remember' a single cell in our <br>
bodies.<br>
<p>
You imply that Powers won't have to be grown, carrying and running up <br>
through the trellises of the universe (the Zones), that they won't evolve, <br>
they'll just 'magically appear' after the God-given Singularity of <br>
Transcension.<br>
<p>
&lt;Our sole responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are; any <br>
problems beyond that are not ours to solve.&gt;<br>
<p>
Rather Deathist I'd say - counting on the children to carry on for you.  It <br>
seems like you're saying that, since *you* can't possibly see *all* then <br>
there's no sense in trying to fathom anything.<br>
<p>
&lt;Also, I doubt the Zones are a metaphor for anything.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, you doubt.  I leave myself free to imagine: associative thinking, <br>
non-local reasoning, traversing the Web, scoping the boundaries of the <br>
unknown.  I call them Zones and they aren't a mere metaphor for me.<br>

&lt;even Vinge himself admits that the only reason he created the concept of <br>
the Zones was [snip] He needed a gimmick to prevent us from transcending <br>
 too soon.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, I *now* recall reading this somewhere, disagreeing, and that's why <br>
Twirlip's original reference to the Zones as a mere gimmick set me off. <br>
 I'm sorry, I prefer the Vernor Vinge who wrote _AFUTD_, not the one who <br>
speculates on the coming Singularity.  Too many people (I'm not implying <br>
Vinge) seem to see this as a magical, effortless, sudden transcension.<br>

P.S. This thread was originally on Zindell. My favorite quote of his from <br>
Anders' list is this:<br>
&lt;We should all know the code of our programs, otherwise we can never be <br>
free.&gt;<br>
I think this is a good corrolary of Tolkien's claim that "perilous to us <br>
all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves."<br>
