What about this one: humans = aryans, robots = jews ? <br>
<p>
or this one: a majority of humans and robots = aryans, a minority of<br>
different humans and different robots = jews ?<br>
<p>
and one for you personally to consider: humans = aryans, humans who want the<br>
freedom to take 'illegal' substances = jews.<br>
<p>
Allthough i'm aware that people who take these substances CHOOSE to do so,<br>
and therefore cannot be compared to an ethnical group, you could also say<br>
that humans do have that same choice to remain human, and not choose to<br>
become (partly) artificial organisms. Look at it this way: would it have<br>
been any less wrong for the nazis to have offered the jews the choice to<br>
either 'become' aryan (should the technology have existed then), or be<br>
persecuted and even exterminated ? (some people who just use the substances,<br>
and don't commit any 'other' crimes, do run a risk of being killed in this<br>
'war on drugs'...)<br>
<p>
<p>
Nothing either you or i wrote in the upper comparisons, includes sufficient<br>
proof that any such a situation will occur as a result of a spread of<br>
extropian or transhumanist memes. And nothing any of the people who<br>
responded wrote, proves that it won't. Anything humans create will posess<br>
both some of our qualities as well as some of our flaws.   <br>
