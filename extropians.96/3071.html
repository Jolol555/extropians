<p>
        Though I don't quite understand the reason why the new<br>
term is necessary (aren't we beyond emotional 'baggage'?) I'll <br>
constrain myself to using the term 'U-Prime' in this post.  <br>
<p>
        In my initial response to David's "God" post, I entertained<br>
the thought of having the universe itself as 'God' a.k.a.: U-Prime.<br>
Needless to say, there was no response to my post.  So I'll make<br>
the suggestion again...in a more detailed manner.<br>
<p>
        Let's assume for a moment that there is but one universe<br>
that extends forever...to the point where eternity and infinity<br>
are indistinguishable from one another.  Let's assume that there<br>
is always further out to go, i.e.: no physical limits.  Now let's<br>
look at the basic physiology of this universe.  For one, if this<br>
universe has no end, then ultimately everything tangible (I'm not<br>
including the possibility of 'anti-matter') is within this<br>
universe.  Ultimately, if every iota of intelligence is within<br>
this universe, the universe itself is omniscient, omnipresent<br>
and omnipotent.  I would consider those traits to denominate the<br>
universe as a (or the?) U-Prime.  The question will inevitably <br>
arise as to "Who created the universe?".  I hope this doesn't<br>
sound closed-minded, but the universe might as well have *always*<br>
been.  Hey, it's possible.<br>
<p>
        Everyone on this list knows me as an artist.  I make a<br>
living out of creating.  Everything I do, I do for making some<br>
sort of progress or creation.  I have a hard time believing that<br>
there is some U-Prime controlling my mind and, in effect, my<br>
creations and my life.  If the definition of a U-Prime is "a<br>
hypothetical creator of universes" as David says, then I would<br>
be forced to call ourselves potential U-Primes --if my previous<br>
paragraph is false.  If there *are* other universes, then I<br>
believe that eventually humans can and will have the ability to<br>
create them.  Why not?  This universe surely has enough resources<br>
to create another universe; all we need is the technology to do<br>
so.  If all of humanity is set on the goal of creating a new universe<br>
through many generations, I think it is attainable.  It may take a<br>
few thousand years, but I don't think it should be ruled out.<br>
But I hold to my thoughts that there is only one universe.<br>
<p>
        Now let's assume that there is one universe that has an<br>
end to it.  Imagine the day that humans have the technology to<br>
extrope to the outer limits of *the* universe.  Now imagine the<br>
feeling once the end was reached.  It would be like Christopher<br>
Columbus seeing that the world was flat and had a drastic end.<br>
Columbus would have been devastated; chances are, the chap would<br>
have killed himself.  Imagine the knowledge that *there is no<br>
further to go*.  I don't even want to think about it.  Instead,<br>
I'd rather see the universe as having *no* end.  I'll maintain<br>
that though until I'm PROVEN wrong.  <br>
<p>
        In a nutshell (pun intended), I think that the universe<br>
is eternal, infinite, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent.<br>
Probably enough in most people's books to classify the universe<br>
as 'God' or 'U-Prime'.  Ultimately, all that occurs is within<br>
the universe, so it could be seen that all is caused *by* the<br>
universe.  <br>
<p>
        Now here's the disclaimer of this post.  I'm a total<br>
atheist.  Not a single scrap of belief in a conventional or<br>
dictative 'God' or 'U-Prime' whatsoever.  I firmly believe that<br>
we, as humans, totally control what we do and how far we go in<br>
life.  To put it bluntly I think that we are 'God'; 'God' on a<br>
human progress basis.  However, if a giant meteor comes from <br>
virtually nowhere and knocks the earth into the sun, there will<br>
be nothing I can do to stop it.  I don't think anything can <br>
stop it.  It happens.  No 'conventional God' or 'U-Prime' <br>
caused it, the universe caused it because it happened within<br>
the universe.  *But* the universe is just a variable that human<br>
'Gods' will have to accept.  We cannot control the universe, but<br>
we are a part of it just the same.  We have the rationale to create<br>
and explore.  We can live our lives as we see fit, ignorant of<br>
the universe around us.  We can create as much as we want within<br>
the universe.  We can go farther and farther into the universe...<br>
as far as we want to go.  But we *are* the universe, or at least<br>
a part of it.<br>
<p>
        Thus, my inflated response\post is done.  I apologize<br>
that the limitations of language made many of my views unclear<br>
and hard to understand, but hey, c'est la vie!<br>
