<i>&gt;The better the compression, the more information looks like noise so this</i><br>
<i>&gt;means that possibly we will never see civilizations more advanced than we</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the only civilizations we will ever see will be less evolved because</i><br>
<i>&gt;equal or higher means we're less likely to recognize them. Damn. [...]</i><br>
<p>
Yes--if They don't *want* to talk to us.  But we might be interesting in<br>
some way.  Btw, crypto is actually more effective at making "noise" than<br>
compression, because what to compression is a tiny inefficiency is to crypto<br>
a chink in the armor--the crypto guys are more intent on the noiselikeness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Shit, you're right. If you wished to get really bizarre, you could say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the dirt under your house is actually an uploaded civilization in statis</i><br>
<i>&gt;with their molecular patterns stored in an organization of dirt molecules</i><br>
<p>
Right, except they aren't in stasis.  If you look<br>
at the amount of *raw* information processing that's going on in that dirt,<br>
and assume that processing is being *used*, it's more than the *useful*<br>
processing going on in our civilizations' brains and computers, I think.<br>
(I'm just not sure how many millimeters or miles you need to dig to make<br>
this true.)<br>
