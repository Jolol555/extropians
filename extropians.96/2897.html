Actually, this is not true. Organic compunds used to living at our<br>
pressure and temp are very sensitive, but only because of the elements<br>
their prtiens use to bind themselves together with. A protein molecule<br>
is like a messed up ball of yarn, with energy bonds wherever the strands<br>
cross. TO do its work as a protein, it must have a certain amount of<br>
springiness to it to stay in solution, and must be able to be broken<br>
apart with little energy input. Too much energy input, and the molecule<br>
will break apart and precipitate out of solution, which is how egg<br>
whites get white when you boil them. Using different elements at the<br>
energy bond points than is used for normal temp organisms allows for<br>
much higher temperature tolerance, as the bonds are much tighter, and<br>
require higher energy input to break them apart, however this makes for<br>
a very tightly bound molecule that only does its chemical work at a<br>
higher temperature. For example, a common protein in bacteria which uses<br>
iron in its makeup, has a corollary protein in hyperthermophilic<br>
bacteria (bacteria that can live above boiling) that uses tungsten<br>
instead.  <br>
<p>
These bacteria have been recovered from deep sea volcanic vents, deep<br>
oil wells, and deep geothermal systems, and have exhibitied preference<br>
for temperatures above 180 degrees F (about 90 C) up to as much as 275 F<br>
(about 130 C). As more varieties are recovered, the upper limit seems to<br>
creep higher, especially as specemins are recovered from deeper and<br>
deeper sites.<br>
