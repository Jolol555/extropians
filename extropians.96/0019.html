Lyle, thanks for your feedback. The definitions, principles, and<br>
explanations of Extropianism can always be improved.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Measure?  in what units?  Does this definition really say anything?</i><br>
<p>
Clearly it says a fair bit. It says, very basically, what extropy is and<br>
thus what it is not. As a brief definition it does not purport to explain<br>
the concept in depth. I have been torn between the virtues of brevity and<br>
informativeness in the definition. When I explain the idea verbally, I<br>
always expand on the definition, qualifying terms and ensuring the audience<br>
understands that it=92s not intended as a techical term (it=92s not meant to=<br>
 be<br>
exactly the opposite of entropy either in a thermodynamic or a information<br>
theoretic sense).<br>
<p>
Despite the resulting incomplete precision, the brevity and simplicity of<br>
the definition show their benefits in the typical reactions I've heard from<br>
it. These are generally positive, and most people seem to get a ready grasp<br>
of the basic idea right away.<br>
<p>
An earlier definition I used described extropy as "the process of<br>
increasing=85" rather than as a measure. Someone objected to that. I don=92t<br>
recall their grounds, though I presume it was that extropy should be the<br>
thing or collection of things being increased rather than the process=<br>
 itself.<br>
<p>
Perhaps "measure" is not the best term to use here. I am not attached to it<br>
and welcome better suggestions. The term "measure" might imply, contrary to<br>
what I want, that extropy is a techical term referring to exactly measurable<br>
physical quantities. While it does refer to a collection of forces and<br>
tendencies, *some* of which are (or in principle might be) exactly<br>
measurable, overall it is not a thing that can be measured scientifically.<br>
<p>
How about defining extropy as:<br>
<p>
   "The extent of a person=92s or a culture=92s intelligence, information,<br>
vitality, diversity,    opportunity, and personal growth."  [I=92ve recently<br>
shortened the list of items to these.]<br>
<p>
I removed "experience" because it=92s just too vague. As you rightly note,=<br>
 why<br>
should we seek to increase experience per se? Of course, that=92s not the<br>
suggestion; it=92s experience of extropic kinds, but that would make the<br>
definition partly circular. The idea behind "experience" was that gaining<br>
more experience (through experimentation and longevity) leads to wisdom,<br>
greater effectiveness, and so on. I dropped "energy" because it can be<br>
subsumed by "vitality". The latter includes longevity and personal energy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; EXTROPIANISM -- The philosophy that seeks to increase extropy.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Assume you can measure all these things; why are we supposed to want=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;to increase them?  I can understand increasing intelligence, vitality, and=</i><br>
=20<br>
<i>&gt;opportunity, but some of the others are problematic. =20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you really want to increase diversity?  Does this mean you=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;oppose the homogenization of cultures? =20</i><br>
<p>
Diversity is a component of extropy that applies to societies. Diversity of<br>
thinking, of approaches, does seem to be healthy for humans and transhumans.<br>
Do I oppose the homogenization of cultures? Depends what you mean. When most<br>
people say "homogenization of cultures" I take them to mean the way you can<br>
find all kinds of ideas, philosophies, religions, political beliefs, ways of<br>
doing things, etc. all within one geographical area, rather than each of<br>
these being tied to its own location. If that=92s what is meant, I don=92t=<br>
 have<br>
a problem with such homogenization. Differing approaches and ideas still<br>
continue, and their mutual criticism is actually likely to be enhanced by<br>
their mutual proximity.<br>
<p>
If you are asking if I oppose the flourishing of all cultures except one,<br>
then yes. It=92s not the kind of thing I can really actively oppose, but I<br>
would be disturbed to see this kind of cultural homogenization, unless,<br>
maybe (and unbelievably!) it was the result of the destruction of almost all<br>
cultures due to effective rational criticism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suppose "energy" refers to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;energy available for use in the economy, and "growth" refers to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic growth.  Do you want to increase these, no matter what? =20</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why is this axiomatic? =20</i><br>
<p>
No, it refers to personal energy primarily, though the increasing<br>
intelligence, information, and related production that extropians seek is<br>
likely to require ever more energy. (Try going to the stars on a small<br>
energy budget.) "Growth" also refers to personal growth. Since that may not<br>
have been clear, I=92ve lengthened the definition by adding the qualifier.<br>
It=92s still shorter than the old definition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Consider the expression "The philosophy that seeks to... " =20</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Does this mean that your metaphysics, your ontology, your logic, your=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy of mind, your ethics, and your aesthetics will be determined=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the need to increase the eight quantities that must be increased? =20</i><br>
<p>
No. Extropianism has never claimed or sought to be a complete philosophy.<br>
It=92s a set of attitudes and values that involve seeking the things listed=<br>
 in<br>
the definition. I believe that the best way to live according to those<br>
values is to recognize reality, rather than imposing our preconceptions on<br>
it. The philosophy of Extropianism seeks to explain the desirability of<br>
these values and to encourage more people to reject indefensible and exitial<br>
(destructive to life) beliefs in favor of extropic attitudes.<br>
