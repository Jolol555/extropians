Yes, I'm sure most hedonists would not consider themselves slaves.  But it<br>
is too easy to convince yourself you seek pleasure voluntarily.<br>
<p>

<p>
An expected response.  But imagine you are dying of cancer and are offered<br>
the opportunity to continue to exist solely as intellect.  Would you take<br>
it?<br>
<p>

<p>
A hedonist *and* an angel?  I'm impressed! &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's anybody's guess how I could keep my guardian angel interested</i><br>

<i>&gt;"loyalty" or "fondness" into it, and that might slow it down against</i><br>
<i>&gt;some faster-on-the-draw "pure intellect". If so, bummer.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not convinced that loyalty and fondness are irrational.  But upon<br>
further thought, I would concede that hedonism isn't necessarily limited to<br>
the pursuit of physical pleasure.  But in (common) practice, it is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You are free to doubt whatever you like; but GIGO. The notion that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"physical needs/desires" is all there is to hedonism is fundamentally</i><br>
<i>&gt;flawed when applied to this particular human. YMMV.</i><br>
<p>
OK, I'll modify my statement.  First, as an objectivist I would certainly<br>
not renounce physical reality.  Perhaps I should say I would prefer to<br>
exist as a combination intellect/physical unit free of mundane physical<br>
needs and desires.<br>
<p>
Perhaps transhumanists should program themselves to experience an intense<br>
orgasm (or something analogous) every time they acquire important<br>
knowledge, gain new insights, or create (or even procreate?) something of<br>
value.<br>
<p>
But I see no reason to preserve animal pleasures, anymore than I would<br>
preserve animal mortality.<br>
