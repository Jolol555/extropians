In a message dated 96-09-08 03:44:16 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Aack! Hell  no - I love my body! Uploading for the purpose of making<br>
flesh or<br>
<i> &gt; uber-flesh backups are the goal I would relish, not some virtual</i><br>
existential<br>
<i> &gt; hell or heaven.</i><br>
 <br>
Rich&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm, why is that?  I don't actually understand this sentiment.  No<br>
matter  how wonderful our current bodies may be, surely it is easy to<br>
conceive of<br>
 forms of existence that are not just superior but immensely more so?  As<br>
 for virtual vs. real, that's a continuous spectrum of incarnations, not<br>
 black or white.  Furthermore, anything that one may "relish" about one's<br>
 human body and one's human emotional machinery applies just as much and<br>
 more to whatever form one chooses to create artifically.  Why then this<br>
 bias towards the terribly limited bodies provided by nature?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
Good question, I think about it a lot.  Yes it is limiting, I am aware of<br>
that. If you want to understand this sentiment, I will try and<br>
explain....mostly it  is because I am still attached to it!  I am in love<br>
with my body. It is still a vaible  possiblity to live in, learn with, and<br>
have a lot of fun in! <br>
I am not eager to "leave this world" I like it! VR worlds sound great, but I<br>
like Real reality - as flawed as it is.<br>
And you say it is easy to *concieve* of thsese things, in some ways,<br>
offhandedly-  I agree, but when I actually *ponder*it &lt; i am not quite so<br>
seduced by VR/ uploaded reality worlds... we will see how I change about that<br>
if it actually becomes an option.<br>
 You know Rich - I love LIFE! I love my body too... I hope we can transcend<br>
it in a BETTER form, but yet cannot quite grapple with what it would be,<br>
realistically.<br>
And keeping it in great living order ( including backups or transplants or<br>
imoortal flesh) seems to me SO FAR the best thing I can do (Dying and then<br>
being frozen is like a lottery ticket to me - I am pretty skeptical about its<br>
probablity).<br>
But when a better thing I can see as  truly VIABLE comes along, I will<br>
certainly try to overcome my revulsion to the other types of "vehicles". Even<br>
uploading. <br>
If it is a chance at immortality - and if it really seems like "life".<br>
The bias you talk about is because my beautiful mortal coil gives me such<br>
great sensations and if possible I would like to keep those - enhance them -<br>
and I would also lke to still be able to see what is happening on the real<br>
earth - "in reality" - and maybe as a machine I can do that and maybe not<br>
Mostly it's a combination of  that and a special  "honoring:" of what I have<br>
now, enjoy it, love it, as an *attitude* -  an attitude to enhance my life<br>
NOW&gt; which keep me positive.<br>
But as Eugene Leitl said in his great response to the same post I replied to,<br>
virtual sweat would sting like the real stuff - so a VR body might be one<br>
option - if it was  "indistinguishable" from my own body * and* unlimited<br>
too, then I would probably opt for the VR version, maybe ... maybe not  - if<br>
I could live forever in reality! : - )<br>
...his post made me think a lot. Better have some GOOD artists making the<br>
sweat...<br>
I am still questioning these thingslike everyone else, but I certainly dont<br>
see the body as a handicap or something I want to get rid of !!<br>
