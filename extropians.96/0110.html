In response to my statement, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At some point (soon) we are going to take charge of our own evolution.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; It will be directed toward some goal.  It is true that different people will </i><br>
<i>&gt; have different purposes, at least for awhile.  I'm not sure this situation </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be stable, however.  The Darwinian competition is going to turn </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather vicious, and people with frivolous goals may not survive.  </i><br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This may be a matter of taste, and my tastes in this matter are </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather ferociously pluralistic. Are you arguing for the homogenization </i><br>
<i>&gt; of culture, or against it?  </i><br>
<p>
We seem to be talking about different things.  You are advocating <br>
pluralism.  I'm not advocating an ism, I'm just saying what I think will <br>
happen.  <br>
<p>
But to be honest, the hard truth is that I really don't know what's <br>
going to happen.  I have an increasing sense of unreality about all this.   <br>
I don't know why people with frivolous goals won't survive.     <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I oppose the homogenization of culture; in the *long* term I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; it would be a disaster. However, I also recognize that the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; long-term solution to this problem is offplanet diaspora. And in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; post-diaspora future I'm fairly confident that purposes/values </i><br>
<i>&gt; will not only be diverse, but will proliferate and ramify far beyond </i><br>
<i>&gt; the scale of value pluralism that we see around us in the world today.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.  If you can't establish a private space on earth, you won't be <br>
able to do it offplanet, either.  Offplanet colonies, like island colonies, <br>
submarine crews, colonies of scientists in Antarctica, or mining towns <br>
in Alaska, will carry human culture with them.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
