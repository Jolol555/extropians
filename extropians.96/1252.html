I hear Andrew Grove speak a lot lately: just yesterday<br>
I was at his lecture at MIT, and now it's NPR.<br>
He published a book, "only the paranoid survive" - mostly<br>
on handling organizational changes; there, he speaks<br>
of Strategic Inflection Points, etc.  It may not be<br>
a breakthrough in the management theory or philosophy<br>
of technology, but is definitely worth attention - at<br>
least as a chance to look into the internals of information<br>
processing architecture of one of the most influential brains<br>
in computer industry.<br>
<p>
One thing that upset/surprised me today listening to Grove's<br>
talk on NPR, is his answer to the question on perspectives of<br>
nanotechnology, and whether he thinks it may be used for<br>
manufacturing computer chips.<br>
<p>
He answered:<br>
<p>
"To tell the truth, I even do not know why we are not using<br>
this technique".<br>
<p>
I would think a man in his position would have a better<br>
knowledge of perspective technologies.<br>
On the other hand, he may have played dumb so that nobody would<br>
suspect Intel is putting most of its research money into Nano-86<br>
or something like that.  With strategic plans being such an<br>
important part of company's welfare, one would expect that CEOs<br>
would be very good at concealing their true opinions in the most<br>
sensitive areas, and making up something plausible with a straight<br>
face.  They would make excellent poker players, these industry<br>
leaders.<br>
<p>
I used to be in similar situations; I had some KGB folks ask me<br>
things about pacifist activities (considered criminal at the time);<br>
the best reply I could find was not to deny them, but to make believe<br>
I was so far away from it so I didn't quite understand the question.<br>
It definitely helped my strategic well-being. ;-)  I had a better<br>
excuse than Grove to hide the truth then - I had more to lose.<br>
<p>
  So what do you think: is he so far away from nanotech that he<br>
hasn't heard about it, or so close that he plays dumb?<br>
<p>
