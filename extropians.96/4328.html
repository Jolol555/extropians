Very few vanilla applications actually require floats, actually. Some new <br>
games do, but this is sloppy programming: fixed-point or scaled integers, <br>
especally xxl integers can substitute any float. Even scientific number <br>
crunching can be done without floats.<br>
<p>
FPUs make dies much larger, and hence more costly. Otoh, Intel price <br>
politics has very little with production costs... My next CPU (I am <br>
giving back my lent SNI (Ob)Scenic 120 MHz, since it sucks so <br>
insufferably ) will be the new AMD, because it has excellent integer <br>
performance and superior power management (if running a proper OS, that <br>
is). Moreover, it is _much_ cheaper than an equivalent Pentium, at slightly <br>
better overall performance (besides floats).<br>
<p>
Don't support monopolies, you always have to pay for that, either in cash <br>
or in an other form, sooner or later. Trouble is, you don't even notice <br>
ruined marketplaces/architectures, because you can't examine an <br>
alternative present, where this particular monopoly does not exist. It is <br>
extremely difficult to argument with customers using alternative courses <br>
of development "See, you could have XY for XZ $$'s just now, if only...".<br>

<i>&gt; instructions on a CPU.  But then again, Intel has been doing this since the</i><br>

<p>
Monopolies are not interested in serving their customers. Why should <br>
they, since there is virtually zero competition (by definition)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; architecture borrowed from IBMs Power 2 series, which also offered superb</i><br>
<i>&gt; floating point performance.</i><br>
<p>
Both PentiumPro and PowerPC, especially in cheap MSP machines are serious <br>
candidates to obsoletify workstations in number crunching applications. <br>
After mainframe has sunk below the surface of the tar pit, workstation's <br>
death knell is beginning to toll, already.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think the P6 is Intel's first x86 CPU with adequate (although modest)</i><br>
<i>&gt; floating point performance.  If I was going to do serious floating point</i><br>
<i>&gt; number crunching though, I would definitely go with PA-RISC, Alpha, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; PowerPC architectures.  I think as Intel's architectures get faster, they</i><br>
<p>
Are you sure you get the most bang for the $$? PA-RISC is horrendously <br>
expensive, as are the better Alphas. Don't know much about PowerPC, <br>
though, but then there are not many vendors shipping them (Apple is <br>
specializing in crippled architectures, as usual).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; are going to find it harder and harder to sell their chips if they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; seriously upgrade their floating point hardware.  Fabulous integer</i><br>
<i>&gt; performance isn't enough for most high-end, computation heavy software,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially in the realm of multimedia where you have a lot of realtime</i><br>
<i>&gt; signal processing and transforms.</i><br>
<p>
The more reason for doing it in 128 bit integers, and with a maspar <br>
pipeline (one CPU for each processing stage). <br>
