<i>&gt; There could be things our minds aren't big</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough to grasp, ideas we don't have the memory to hold the parts of;</i><br>
<i>&gt; there could be Powers capable of thinking faster than we do; but those</i><br>
<i>&gt; are the differences between a computer with 16 megs of RAM and 4K, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; between a Pentium and a 8086.  A qualitative difference would be that</i><br>
<i>&gt; between any computer and a wristwatch.  To believe that there is such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference above us is purely a matter of belief.  Act on it if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; wish; I find myself believing that no Power could do something which a</i><br>
<i>&gt; liberal-minded cosmopolitan could not understand, given time and data.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My very vague thesis: All undamaged human beings, and other sentiences,</i><br>
<i>&gt; share the same area of comprehensibility.</i><br>
<p>
I have a totally irrefutable answer to that which this reply is<br>
unfortunately too early to contain.<br>
<p>
I can still try refutable answers, though.<br>
<p>
Would a blind man - someone more than blind, with the visual cortex<br>
removed, who loses all ability to visualize two-dimensional spaces or<br>
even remember what it was like to see - be able to comprehend an Escher<br>
painting?  (The answer, incidentally, is "Yes, but only intellectually,<br>
as a problem in constrain propagation.")<br>
<p>
Perhaps in that "foil" sense, there will be some things the Powers can<br>
offhandedly invent which it would take billions of lifetimes for a human<br>
with unlimited memory to acheive a distant causal comprehension of, much<br>
as a human might trace the action of the visual cortex neuron-by-neuron.<br>
<p>
The totally incomprehensible things - it's too early.<br>
