You may be giving the industry credit for being too informed.<br>
<p>
I haven't yet seen a standard for including accounting/permissions<br>
agents *into* sample segments from digital media streams.  In the case<br>
of derivative art, the industry could profit tremendously conditionally<br>
releasing copyrighted works into "the derivative domain".  <br>
<p>
For creative new media artists, the freedom to reuse commercial material<br>
without going through permissions-bureaucracies will dramatically<br>
accelerate the content development process.  The obvious application is<br>
machine-mediated content delivery, initially of near-CD quality audio.<br>
<p>
Instead of sending someone "Virtual Flowers", you could send them a<br>
personalized playlist or remix.  The idea is not to avoid compensating<br>
the intellectual property owners.  The goal is reward them through<br>
automated transaction systems.<br>
<p>
I think you give them too much credit.  Maybe now is not the opportune<br>
time to present solutions, but it's a good time to plant some seeds. <br>
Maybe by next Christmas, the mechanisms can be standardized and<br>
operational.<br>
