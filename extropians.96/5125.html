<i>&gt;Subject: Re: Trans- vs. Non-human</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Extropy is the idea of actively pushing for a better future."  You said</i><br>
<i>&gt;it; presumably you wished to communicate something with it.  By itself,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it communicates very little, because 'better' means "higher up in some</i><br>
<i>&gt;scale of value". [...]</i><br>
<p>
...and that means very little?  What I'm saying is that simply having a<br>
scale of values--any values--is a *big* thing.  This doesn't seem to mean<br>
much to you because you don't see the opposite threat: the ways people<br>
manage to cancel out, bypass, look down on, obfuscate and be unaware of<br>
their own (and others') values.  The ways people go along with what they<br>
see as the trend rather than identifying what makes them individual.<br>
<p>
Just look at how popular the meme of "selflessness" is.  Or how people<br>
worship opinion cloaked in "objectivity."  Or the current political<br>
incorrectness of "prejudice," "intolerance" and "discrimination."<br>
There are ideas out there--and habits of thought and discussion--that work<br>
*against* having values.  And this discussion had one example that should<br>
have been glaring to everyone: One person expressed distaste at people<br>
trying to become "non-human," and another person treated this as an example<br>
of intolerance!<br>
<p>
And when I pointed out that this was overdoing tolerance--that one shouldn't<br>
just "tolerate" everything because that's abdicating one's own values--<br>
then I got a bunch of replies saying I should define my terms, etc.<br>
<p>
This is a bad habit of discussion: to demand a defining of terms whenever<br>
one is confused.  It gets in the way of discussions of value.  It makes it<br>
*harder* to process values because it's an excursion into areas of abstract<br>
logic and philosophy that are beside the point, a very simple point.<br>
<p>
If you haven't seen examples of non-humanness, if you don't get a chilling<br>
feeling of recognition when you hear that phrase "trying to become non-<br>
human," then you and I are in such different mental territories that my<br>
trying to explain would be a major job that I'm not ready for.  No hard<br>
feelings, just take my word for it that what I value about humanness is a<br>
big subject, and I'm a bit of a nerd myself when it comes to explaining it.<br>
<p>
If you do have a sense of what that phrase means, then we have a starting<br>
point for discussions along these lines, and I don't have to define my<br>
terms; you got the basic idea, and I'm not going to assume we agree in<br>
details I didn't express.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;} So the original point was whether it's okay (and clear) to use "non-human"</i><br>
<i>&gt;} as a derogatory term, without defining what one means exactly.  I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;} it is [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;*shrug*  It is okay for you.</i><br>
<p>
But clear?  I guess for some people it isn't.  I would have thought that<br>
we all had enough of a shared base of values that "non-human" had a some<br>
sort of negative connotation for everyone.  But instead of<br>
   "Now just a minute!  Are you calling me non-human!?"<br>
we got<br>
   "Now just a minute!  What's so bad about being non-human!?"<br>
!  Maybe we don't have that shared feeling, or maybe some people here are<br>
actively confusing themselves out of realizing that they do feel that way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Some people will consider shedding some</i><br>
<i>&gt;parts of humanity to _be_ an improvement.</i><br>
<p>
*Some parts*, sure, but humanity itself?  I have a hard time thinking of<br>
that as a value.  Would you call a compulsion to pull out one's hairs<br>
a "value?"  It's more a self-destructive tendency or malfunction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So by your own definition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;those non-human aspirants are as extropian as you.</i><br>
<p>
No.  This is my point!  They aren't extropian by my definition if they<br>
are doing what they are doing because they have short-circuited their<br>
own value systems, which is in fact what I think some people on this<br>
list are doing.  People who talk about getting rid of their emotions,<br>
for instance, are expressing self-canceling value systems.  Value systems<br>
that don't have enough sense of self protection to be given sharp knives.<br>
Ignorant self-immolation is not "extropian."  That's too much of a stretch.<br>
If we were talking about an informed theory of what emotions are and how<br>
someone would like them to be different, that would be a different story.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I guess I wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;have said what Y said above. ["Trans-human is necessarily non-human to</i><br>
<i>&gt;some extent, and you're being intolerant."]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have nothing against values, or expressing values.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]  But expressing a difference in</i><br>
<i>&gt;values doesn't have to be derogatory -- shouldn't be, unless you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;actively trying to control someone else's values.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't derogation simply mean expressing a negative value, implying<br>
that something is bad?  If it is a very bad thing you're talking about,<br>
why shouldn't you use a derogatory term?  Why this pussyfooting around<br>
such a clear issue?  I suspect that you are expressing a habit of<br>
softening your opinions and values--a habit that is just getting in the<br>
way in this case.  Who are we afraid of offending here?<br>
<p>
There are no "non-humans" here.  What I'm derogating is the (I think)<br>
unintended outcome of non-humanness.  It was banjo (who has left) who<br>
brought up the term.  Maybe he thought that some people here actually<br>
want to be non-human.  I don't believe that, but what I'm afraid of is<br>
that there are people here who don't realize the non-human implications of<br>
what they are saying, or who have forgotten the importance of humanness.<br>
