<i>&gt; I think the extropian meme has succeeded in establishing itself as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  commonly known term for a certain social type, like "biker" or "wigger" </i><br>
<i>&gt;  or "yuppie."  Or "Satanist."  Apparently the public has a rather sinister </i><br>
<i>&gt;  perception of extropians, taking Moravec as the prototype of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  overman who wants to become a cyborg and destroy the world.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  How wrong is this perception?  Is there anyone here who is not </i><br>
<i>&gt;  fascinated by such thoughts?   I was thinking along those lines in 1965, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  when I read "Profiles of the Future" by Arthur C. Clarke.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If Moravec is *not* a prototypical extropian, then the meme has a serious </i><br>
<i>&gt;  public relations problem.  Dery's book was a public relations disaster.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But then, memes are as selfish as genes, and will find their own way to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  survive.  Memes decide which other memes to mate with, and their </i><br>
<i>&gt;  parents can't always control their choices.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Beyond PR, there is the question of what to do about Moravec, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;  others who entertain fantasies -- not necessarily idle fantasies - about </i><br>
<i>&gt;  setting forces in motion that would kill billions of obsolete people.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The question is not what to say, but what, if anything, to do.  If you </i><br>
<i>&gt;  knew that someone intended to kill almost everybody on the planet, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  except for a remnant who would be protected -- what would you do?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Join him?  Assasinate him?  or do nothing?  </i><br>
<p>
This and Max's response about Moravec are interesting.  I confess to not<br>
having read Moravec's "Mind Children" -- I will, but feel I already had most<br>
of the ideas folks have talked about as being in that book 25 years ago.<br>
 (Also inspired by Clarke; although it was the chapter in "2001" entitled<br>
"Experiment" for me.)<br>
<p>
I've encountered a lot of thoughtless "fear and loathing" for concepts<br>
fundamental to the extropian philosphy and agenda in otherwise fairly<br>
intelligent and well-educated people -- both before and after I'd heard of<br>
the word "extropian".  I recall a very bright woman accusing me of being a<br>
"Nazi" because I advocated radical human genetic engineering and many who<br>
have called me "cold" because I want to upload.  Ironically, the ex-husband<br>
of the woman who called me a Nazi years later had some very unflattering<br>
things to say about Moravec in an e-mail exchange with me.  That same fellow<br>
characterizes extropians as "hyper-yuppies".  <br>
<p>
So some see us "techno-bikers" and others as "hyper-yuppies".  As Anais Nin<br>
said, "We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are."  (But an<br>
aside: In my time, I've been both a "biker" and a "yuppie" ... hmmmm .... )<br>
<p>
To a certain extent, the "problem" arises from a misunderstanding of the role<br>
of compassion in the extropian world-view.  As I've written on the &gt;H list,<br>
there is *nothing* in the extropian philosophy that is inconsistent with<br>
compassion.  My vision of my own self-transformation does not include<br>
"leaving compassion behind" by any means; far from it.  I would hope my<br>
capacity for pathos would be magnified along with every other capcity of the<br>
mind.<br>
<p>
The "inimical post-human superman" to which Lyle refers is a good moral<br>
problem here.  It was, in fact, the subject (sort of) of an exchange I had<br>
with Rich Artym on the &gt;H list regarding his "Unlimited Individual Freedom"<br>
(UIF) concept -- a set of ideas about which I have well-known reservations.<br>
 But I offer for consideration that the problem is only one of degree, not<br>
kind.  <br>
<p>
The means exist today for a capable individual or small group of individuals<br>
to destroy whole cities.  Moral monsters blow up airplanes full of innocent<br>
people now.  As things are now, we entrust our safety with regard to these<br>
things largely to the state.  In the stateless or "state-minimal" world to<br>
which we look forward here, how will we react to such threats, magnified in<br>
the quantity of the threat, but no less evil?<br>
<p>
Answering that cacooning one's self in high-tech defenses or gettin' the hell<br>
outta Dodge are fine for an individual, but take no account of compassion.  I<br>
shall leave my own thoughts on tsolutions to this hard problem for another<br>
day ...<br>
