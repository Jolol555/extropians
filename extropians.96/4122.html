<i>&gt;The definition of "extropy" has evolved over time. If there's to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussion of it, it would be good to begin with the most current version,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as printed in Extropy #17.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a good plan to me. I hope that the most current definition will<br>
soon be more widely published and make its way to the web sites that<br>
concern it, and that Max More and Tom Morrow are credited as its<br>
originators forevermore.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The current definition is" "Extropy -- the extent of a person's or a</i><br>
<i>&gt;culture's intelligence, information, vitality, diversity, opportunity, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;[personal] growth." "Personal" might be removed since it fits with person</i><br>
<i>&gt;but not very well with culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Besides, it is already implied in "the extent of a person's...", yes?<br>
<p>
I'm confused about the culture part. What does "cultural growth" mean?<br>
Is the definition of culture in this context something near to "the<br>
concepts, habits, skills, arts, instruments, etc. of a given people in a<br>
given period"?<br>
It means "more and more of lots of things we value", I guess. Okay then.<br>
<p>
Information - having lots of it is good - but perhaps knowledge or learning<br>
or understanding is even better. Why was experience removed from the list?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;While I'm all in favor of tuning up this definition, I caution against</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying for a pseudo-precision. It's not a scientific measure.</i><br>
<p>
Clearly not. Pseudoscience sucks.<br>
<p>
 Its a metaphor<br>
<i>&gt;the the kinds of things we value, and for the overcoming of human limits in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a perpetual process of improvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
"A metaphor for the kinds of things we value." I think that's a great place<br>
to begin. Our values define what "improvement" means to us, so "a perpetual<br>
process of improvement" points back to the beginning.<br>
<p>
Is "human" necessary in "for the overcoming of human limits"? Aren't we<br>
interested in overcoming limits - of all kinds?<br>
<p>
