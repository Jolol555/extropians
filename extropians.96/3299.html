<i>&gt;&gt; We need to go public more often to spread our memes ANY WAY</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; POSSIBLE!! I strongly point in the direction of having a booth at </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Trekkie conventions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why stop there?  My friend Jaga, the Hare Krishna devotee, told me </i><br>
<i>&gt;she used to collect more than a thousand dollars a day at the Denver </i><br>
<i>&gt;Airport; several thousand on a good day.  And that was more than 20 </i><br>
<i>&gt;years ago, when a thousand dollars was more money than it is now.</i><br>
<p>
Wow. Maybe it is a good method?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Chris, why don't you go to the L.A. airport, wearing an Extropy t-shirt </i><br>
<i>&gt;or some kind of Extropian costume (use your imagination), and ask for </i><br>
<i>&gt;donations?</i><br>
<p>
Funny, I was just there 2 days ago to pickup someone. We want to make the<br>
extropians look cool and stylish not nerdy so we can apply the memes to the<br>
mainstream masses. They might find costumes or Tshirts hokey. Let me think<br>
for awhile how we could do it in a stylish cool almost 'Wired<br>
Magazine'-like way.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Last </i><br>
<i>&gt;summer I spent a lot of time in Huntington Beach.  One afternoon I was </i><br>
<i>&gt;approached five different times by Christians who wanted me to come </i><br>
<i>&gt;to a revival meeting.  The fifth time, when the guy asked me if I was a </i><br>
<i>&gt;Christian, I said "No, I'm a Satanist," and a very interesting conversation </i><br>
<i>&gt;ensued.</i><br>
<p>
HAHAHAHA!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is no use being shy.  Go public!  Spread your memes ANY WAY </i><br>
<i>&gt;POSSIBLE!!  </i><br>
<p>
We need a happy medium we need to make the extropians appear 'cool' so<br>
people join in but we need to spread specific memes that don't interfere<br>
with their individual religious beliefs and slowly convert them to our<br>
optimistic philosophy. You can also twist information for any use such as<br>
religious or pollitical to make it sound like you're agreeing with their<br>
ideals such as telling bleeding heart liberals that nano will be the<br>
utility to accomplish their goal of world peace and unlimited wealth. (Even<br>
though there will still be capitalism, we just won't meantion that!)<br>
