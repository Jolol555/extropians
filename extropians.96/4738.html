Lyle Burkhead went back and re-read all my posts to this list over the past <br>
two months and noticed how consistent my writing style has been on this list <br>
over that time.  He announced this in response to me saying that I undergo <br>
profound belief system changes on a regular basis.<br>
<p>
First of all, "David Musick" is only an interface which was designed to <br>
communicate on the Extropians list.  It's a role that I am playing for the <br>
Extropians list.  There are certain styles of writing and thinking which <br>
"David Musick" is allowed to use in these posts.  The character, "David <br>
Musick" is not who I am, it is only one minor aspect of me.<br>
<p>
Creating a character which has certain thinking styles and communication <br>
styles and then consistently presenting that character to others is a powerful <br>
way of communicating certain ways of thinking.  When others get familiar with <br>
a certain character they like, they begin to incorporate those traits into <br>
their own mind.  "David Musick" is a style of thinking about things and <br>
explaining things which I use on this list.  The ideas that "David Musick" <br>
communicates are important, but the basic thinking style is what I'm most <br>
wanting to communicate.  So, people reading lots of the writings of "David <br>
Musick" will have the ability to ask themselves in various situations, "What <br>
would David Musick think about this?"<br>
<p>
In spite of my major belief system changes, most of my daily, learned <br>
functions remain relatively unchanged; for example:  I still remember how to <br>
walk and how to play the piano.  Acting as "David Musick" is a fairly easy and <br>
basic task for me, so my performance is mostly unaffected by my other changes.<br>
<p>
Lyle asks, "If you have been through a change as traumatic as the shift from <br>
theism to atheism in the last month, it doesn't show. Can you give an example <br>
of a major belief system that has changed in the last few weeks, or even the <br>
last few months?"<br>
<p>
This is a little difficult.  I know of no words to adequately describe the <br>
major changes that have been going on here.  Basically, the changes have had <br>
to do with my sense of identity and with my perception of my world.  Over the <br>
past week or so, I have been making a profound shift from seeing myself as a <br>
particular person with certain character traits and beliefs to a state of mind <br>
where there are only experiences flowing, thoughts arising and falling, where <br>
I identify more with my current, constantly changing perceptions than I do <br>
with my belief of my past and who I think I am.<br>
<p>
In many ways, what's happening now is an extension of what was being worked on <br>
before.  It's just that a certain threshold of learning had been passed and <br>
then a great change could happen, where the ideas went from the purely <br>
intellectual to the experiential.  When theism was dropped, it felt like a <br>
profound change at the time, but when the memories are traced back, it is <br>
obvious that the change was being prepared for, for several years.  It was <br>
simply a matter of going over the threshold of acceptance, the point of no <br>
return.  A matter of letting it sink in and accepting the change fully.<br>
<p>
Big changes happen here so quickly because lessons are applied and *lived* <br>
very quickly.  When new things are learned, they are incorporated very deeply <br>
by the intelligence rather than being thought about at a distance, in the <br>
abstract, for long periods of time, as the custom was here previously.<br>
<p>
Keep in mind that I have many personality groups, and I'm very good at acting <br>
out certain characters and playing different roles.  Most people I deal with <br>
have no idea what's going on inside me because they don't see me switch roles <br>
in front of them dramatically.  When they deal with me, they deal with a <br>
consistent personality group, which I select, depending on the type of person <br>
I observe them to be and what sort of a relationship I wish to form with them. <br>
 So as long as I present the personality group, "David Musick", you will see a <br>
fairly consistent personality on this list.  There is consideration here of <br>
presenting lots of different personalities and writing styles.  There is much <br>
debate and argument regarding the matter, and there are many factors to <br>
consider, as far as many here are concerned.  We shall see.<br>
