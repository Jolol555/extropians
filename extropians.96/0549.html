No, no one can reasonably make that claim, by any stretch of<br>
the imagination.  What I disagree with is Chris Hind's assumption<br>
that Max is a "central authority".  It's misleading language, and<br>
gives the distinct and incorrect impression that "where Max<br>
leads, we shall follow".  I personally agree with almost everything<br>
Max has to say, but only because I submit what he says first to<br>
the "central authority" between my ears, for my own evaluation.<br>
Max is one of the most consistently rational people I've ever<br>
had the pleasure to deal with.  I dislike seeing him misrepresented,<br>
whether by ignorance or guru worship.<br>
<p>
Another thing: alt.extropians is several years old.  If one is<br>
going to do something with it, call it "resurrection" or<br>
"resuscitation", rather than "ribbon cutting".<br>
