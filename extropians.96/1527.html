Nope.  The primary rationale for dues was to help pay for the cost of the<br>
private software (MailWeir), I think.  Now we use majordomo, and<br>
everything is open, and I'm not convinced it is an improvement.  The<br>
list is certainly more active, and arguably invigorated, but I think it<br>
is also noisier than it was.  In the past I had one person excluded on<br>
the extropians list and many people filtered out on the transhuman list;<br>
now the two have nearly identical killfiles.  (procmail, for the<br>
technically curious.)<br>
<p>
The old fee was between $8 and $14.  Sometimes I think charging one cent<br>
might be beneficial, just for the filter of physically mailing<br>
something.<br>
<p>
Then there are the very devoted and energetic people who will pay the<br>
due and still not have anything to say...<br>
