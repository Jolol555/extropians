<i>&gt; (information-) ontology. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The big problem in this debate is that we always confuse numerical </i><br>

<p>
<p>
Yes, but I think that most people here want to *experience* the <br>
upload, not generate a bunch of clones who *think* they were <br>
uploaded.  In a destructive upload, our stream of consciousness would <br>
cease to exist.  We would be dead and there would be a computer <br>
program running that would swear it was us, and would in fact be us, <br>
albeit running on a separate stream of consciousness.  I don't think <br>
too many people would terminate their own stream of consciousness to <br>
create new independant ones.  What would be the advantage?<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; physical matter. Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; information (as opposed to copying) is a fundamental limitation of all </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; information systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, if I encode a message in something (say a disk or a hydrogen</i><br>
<i>&gt; atom), I can move it around quite well without copying it. Information</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't seem to be able to exist on its own, it needs to be encoded in</i><br>
<i>&gt; something since it is a pattern. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You are only moving the substrate upon which the information is <br>
encoded.  Information itself cannot be moved because it has no <br>
physical properties.  When I say move, I mean move from one substrate <br>
to another.  The physical translation of information from one point in space <br>
to another is meaningless in an information context.<br>
<p>
The problem of saying that information can be moved is that it allows <br>
the spontaneous creation of information.  If this was the case, a cat <br>
could "spontaneously" derive and understand the Schroedinger <br>
wave equations without having the slightest concept of physics or <br>
math.<br>
 <br>
For information to exist it must be encoded.  This *requires* that <br>
information can only be copied or destroyed.  "New" information is <br>
only the reorganization of existing information into a format that is <br>
meaningful to us.  Even our imaginations are constrained by the limits of <br>
our experience.<br>
<p>
If I am not mistaken, the "Information can not be moved, only copied" <br>
theorem has been proven mathematically.  Unfortunately, this reflects <br>
the strong entropic property  of information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even if we would accept your argument, it wouldn't make uploading </i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible. It would just make some of us more reluctant to try it, while </i><br>
<i>&gt; others wouldn't care. </i><br>
<p>
I am not saying it is impossible to upload; it is impossible only in <br>
the sense of uploading a single, existing stream of consciousness as opposed to <br>
creating a new stream of consciousness.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The big question I have, is information == consciousness? Or consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; a property of information (processing)? Or something else?  Big question,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard to answer. </i><br>
<p>
This, of course, IS the big question.  If consciousness is based upon <br>
information and information processing, my above statements hold.  If <br>
not, then everything I said becomes irrelevant to the question.<br>
<p>
Personally, I believe that consciousness is a result of the <br>
architecture of our information storage and processing systems.  If <br>
this was not the case, we would be delving into the fuzzy world of <br>
metaphysics.<br>
