          Hal Finney summarised the Carter-Leslie Doomsday argument <br>
          (about a week ago). He mentioned two problems he had with <br>
          it:<br>
          <br>
          1) The reference class is not well-defined. -This objection <br>
          I think that John Leslie has successfully answered in The <br>
          End of the World. The idea is that you can choose any <br>
          reference class you like. If you are interested in Homo <br>
          Sapiens Sapiens, then you consider your relative position in <br>
          that species; if you are interested in any form of <br>
          intelligent life stemming from humans, then that is what you <br>
          should look at when you define the alternative scenarios. <br>
          (BTW, it is not correct to assume as I think Hal did that it <br>
          would follow from the Doomsday argument that we should <br>
          expect to live at a moment when there have been roughly as <br>
          many humans before us as will come after us: the expectation <br>
          value of f=time(population) need not be the anything like a <br>
          maximum.)<br>
          <br>
          2) One explanation for why we are where we are would be that <br>
          we are being simulated by posthumants who like to watch the <br>
          critical part of their history aagain and again. -I don't <br>
          think this is very plausible. First, I think it is naive to <br>
          suppose that these guys would be very interested in watching <br>
          the soap opera with you and me in the titel roles over and <br>
          over again, complete with all the details of how we trim our <br>
          finger nails or go to the toilet -for Godssake, what sort of <br>
          idea do you have of these posthumans! Second, even if they <br>
          did found some pleasure in this sick show, it would <br>
          presumably be economical for them to have many posthumans <br>
          watching the same simulation, wherefore they would still be <br>
          in majority over us, and we are back again to the fact that <br>
          needed explanation.<br>
          <br>
          I myself am busy trying to write a critique of the Doomsday <br>
          argument, which, when it is finished, I would gladly supply <br>
          to Hal and anyone else who might be interested.<br>
          <br>
