WOW, you took me ALL wrong. All I want to do is organize the extropians<br>
into groups of people across the country or world that actually do<br>
something that are more motivated than to sit on their asses discussing<br>
until the thread downward spirals into semantics. I'm not planning a<br>
dictatorship! But what I AM saying is that these groups of individuals<br>
would get together and consider who to aim for to spread the most media<br>
attention. Lets say you know someone who knows someone with alot of media<br>
focus such as a celebrity or other figurehead such as cybercelebrities like<br>
Andressen. You should attempt to explain the issues to them and see what<br>
they think. You may get some supporters with wide media focus. Television<br>
broadcast is one of the best ways to spread memes. This meme spreading<br>
technique has been time tested to work. We don't want to spread it like a<br>
religion just get people familiar with optimism primarily and future tech.<br>
