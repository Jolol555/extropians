<i>&gt; So, how do we get there? And is the limit due to the rest of our brains </i><br>
<i>&gt; (which cannot handle the load of more than 7+-2 things at once) or bad </i><br>
<i>&gt; design (there has so far not been any need for more than 7 things at </i><br>
<i>&gt; once). If the latter, then increased intelligence may be within reach. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Of course, this is just one aspect of intelligence. We might get </i><br>
<i>&gt; paralyzed by all the possibilities too if we are not careful). </i><br>
<p>
Speaking from personal experience: been there, done that. :\ :)<br>
Last time I did a Myers-Briggs (years ago), I evaluated as EN&lt;T+F&gt;P,<br>
what some would call a "visionary journalist"--talk about paralysis! &lt;big g&gt;<br>
<p>
Properly directed attention is a wondrous thing. The lack of an <br>
operating manual for the brain has been remarked on by many. <br>
Some people think that "mania", "depression", "dysthymia", <br>
"obsessive-compulsive disorder" and "autism" are in many cases just <br>
different-appearing quasi-stable states that all boil down to an <br>
inability to shift attention. And stuckness sure can look like <br>
stupidity. Of course, so can irrelevance (mania, schizophrenia)<br>
that may not look like "stuckness" to some people.<br>
<p>
My current view is that "chunking up" (which may be the same as <br>
subsumption, I'm not sure), delegating (using trust and Iterated <br>
Prisoner's Dilemma) properly, and "optimal" (low-overshoot) context <br>
switching are all ways to get a lot more out of the brain I've got <br>
right now.<br>
<p>
In my case, five years of introspection following a failed <br>
relationship, plus the Avatar course, plus some work with my <br>
neurochemistry seems to have put me in my personal bliss zone more of <br>
the time than I would have thought possible or comprehensible say ten <br>
years ago. Have you seen the "Hedonistic Imperative" Web page?<br>
<p>
I think the notion that seven plus or minus two was just good enough <br>
to get the genes through is probably a workable "least hypothesis".<br>
