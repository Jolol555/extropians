 But the first time -- ?   How do you <br>
start?  <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Acquiring or developing gear that can communicate trends in the state <br>
you wish to influence without being too disturbing is the first step.<br>
<p>
Then you sit down and relax with no interruptions for a hunk of time.<br>
Start with very few expectations and let your mind wander, or <br>
meditate--different people get results different ways. But keep part <br>
of your attention on the signal from the gear.<br>
<p>
Any other person present should be someone who won't contribute <br>
disturbance, but can cue you about external stuff--make an agreement <br>
about whether this should be done during or after the session.  <br>
This can be particularly useful, for instance, when trying to influence <br>
brainwave states--otherwise you may be training some scalp or eyelid <br>
muscle(s) instead of  affecting your EEG.<br>
<p>
I taught myself to raise and lower my hand temperature(s) independent <br>
of one another in something like 8-10 hours of 20-minute sessions.<br>
Pulse control took longer, and I still find it a lot easier when I'm <br>
off caffeine than when I'm on it. I assume it's blood chemistry related, but <br>
there may be a cognitive component as well.<br>
<p>
I never did much with EEG.  I'm interested in BP, which is rumored <br>
to be harder.<br>
<p>
The model I have for how it happens is that I treat the signal (let's <br>
say it's a continuous tone) as an itch I vaguely want to scratch, or <br>
a muscle I kind of want to stretch. If I don't get into a relatively <br>
"don't care" frame of mind, I can blast myself right out of the state <br>
due to excitement, not unlike dropping the balls in glee the first <br>
time one juggles, or popping out of lucid dreaming when you notice<br>
you're doing it.<br>
<p>
Yeah, I know it's vague, but remember you're trying to turn an <br>
"involuntary" aspect into a "voluntary" one. No surprise that the <br>
words aren't there... :)<br>
