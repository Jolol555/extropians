<p>
The main problem in the identity debate is that it might be that identity <br>
doesn't exist outside of our minds; it is a relatively arbitrary concept <br>
which works well in everyday life, but breaks down in its "classic" form <br>
as we nears the edges of life. <br>
<p>
The shared memory example is relevant; identity as it is commonly used <br>
seems to not be preserved in time reversal. All past selves that I can <br>
remember being are seen as me, but the potential future selves that I <br>
might be are not me - yet. So from a posthuman upload's view, it might be <br>
the same being who once was flesh and blood (or even the same beings who <br>
eventually merged into it). But this is just one way of seeing it. <br>

"I seem to be a verb" or as I recently wrote<br>
<p>
I am not an indivudual.<br>
An atom with a shining gnostic nucleus.<br>
I am a wind, a verb, a process<br>
That evolves and changes by my own rules.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I guess it comes down to my belief that the concept of identity will </i><br>

<i>&gt; spinning off replicants ("partials" in Greg Bear's lingo from Eon),</i><br>

<i>&gt; I doubt we can even think intelligently about what the results will be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (But please try! It's of intense interest to me! :)</i><br>
<p>
I think we will develop new terms to deal with it. The current identity <br>
concept is so riddled with assumptions that we should scrap it, like "to <br>
be" is scrapped in E-prime. Maybe we should use E-bis to mean English <br>
without "to be" and "I"? <br>
