One should remember that logic is one half of creativity; the other half<br>
is coming up with new ideas, the other is to test and apply them. Too many<br>
people lack one side, and either just churn out half-baked or useless<br>
ideas or criticize themselves so much they can never produce anything. <br>

[Warning, amateur psychologist mode on. Just one term of study, YMMV:]<br>
<p>
I think control is the crucial bit, not the depression (that was <br>
probably just some bad schemata you overcame). I did something <br>
similar when I was younger, and became my current insufferably happy and <br>
creative self. <br>
<p>
There is a risk you are overcontrolling yourself, not letting your<br>
creative impulses emerge out of fear your depression will return. This is<br>
unlikely, since you now know that you can overcome your negative <br>
thoughts. I think you should look a bit at cognitive psychology, <br>
especially its model for how depression works. Once you have understood <br>
it, I think you will feel much more secure in your optimism and doesn't <br>
have to control it so strictly. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps I need a round of bad luck or two?</i><br>
<p>
Look out for the "Tortured artist" meme, it is rather silly. You can be <br>
creative *and* happy, bad luck usually just makes you angry or depressed, <br>
and that is seldom good for creativity. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have been able to feel my creative side as though it</i><br>
<i>&gt; were tangible through certain types of music but can't quite grasp it. When</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was younger I used to be quite the horticulturist. Perhaps I need to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; back in touch with nature? Maybe I need to bring out my creative side</i><br>
<i>&gt; through mysticism such as wicca or other so-called new age religions?</i><br>
<p>
Why not? Or better, design your own system. The suggestion somebody had <br>
about making a self-sculpture and placing in a garden was IMHO a very <br>
good idea. You could try creating a depiction of yourself or your <br>
creativity, or perhaps something symbolic of each, and then combining it. <br>
Such symbolism works very well on the subconscious levels. <br>
<p>
And if you can, surround yourself with creative people! It is fun!<br>
