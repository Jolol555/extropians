&lt;&lt; This kind of top-down<br>
 structure reeks of a closed fascism, where the guy at the top gives the<br>
 orders and the men/women at the bottom have to take it or leave. here`s <br>
 no room for negotiation.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't see it as top down. I see it as:<br>
<p>
If you have something or do something that people are willing to pay for,<br>
negotiation works very well with salaries, working conditions, job duties,<br>
etc.  If you don't have something people are willing to pay for . . .  Then<br>
there is a problem in need of fixing via education, skills,  training, etc.<br>
<p>
I don't understand what "closed fascism" is.  To me fascism is when you are<br>
NOT free to choose what you want to do with private property or your self<br>
because they are under government regulation.  But, we ARE free to choose in<br>
this case, right?? like jobs?  We all chose our jobs one way or another.<br>
  The government did not tell me where to work.  The companies didn't tell me<br>
either.  In fact, I started my our company.   You can too.  It's your choice.<br>
 It's everyone's choice.  <br>

&lt;&lt;My point is that competition cannot help worker conditions, nor can it <br>
eliminate the authoritarian nature of business. The coop  may not be able <br>
to compete with the big corporation because they pay fair equal wages, <br>
while the big corporation may not. &lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
Wisconsin Dairies Co-Op does pay well.  If a worker thinks the pay isn't<br>
fair: "Work for someone else", e.g. WD Co-Op or start your own company.<br>
 Become an independent contractor.   There is always an option.  Learn to do<br>
something people want to pay for.  <br>
<p>
If the "big" company is so evil why isn't everybody paid minimum wage?<br>
 Because negotiation works with or without a Union.  Workers are as free to<br>
choose their employers just as a company is free to choose its workers.<br>
 Employers and workers are as free as negotiation lets them be.  Look for the<br>
Win-Win. <br>
<p>
But, if you start your own company, know this:  I pay 35% income tax plus 15%<br>
self employment tax. . . a total of 50% tax.  So, to compensate for the tax<br>
and business expenses I raised my fee from  $25 per hour before I had my own<br>
company to $75 now that I have my own company, to get the same standard of<br>
living.   If I was to incorporate I would get double taxed i.e. beyond the<br>
50% rate which would lower my standard of living.  <br>
