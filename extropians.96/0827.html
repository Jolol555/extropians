<i>&gt;Why does being living in a virtual world have to preclude living in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"real" world?  Why not create a virtual-real-world inside of the virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt;world.  The actions in the virtual-real-world would correspond to</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions made by a robot in the real world and as a result you could do</i><br>
<i>&gt;any real-world work that needed to be done while still staying in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;virtual world.  It seems to me a system like that would allow for</i><br>
<i>&gt;continued interaction in the real world while seamlessly continuing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;exist in a virtual world.</i><br>
I rather suggested biological humanoid drone bodies where there would be a<br>
box in the head which would be a computer and there would be a two way<br>
interface between the box and the wetware motor functions to control the<br>
body while sending info from the senses directly to the computer in the box.<br>
This would allow you to be uploaded to the box in the head or alternatively<br>
control it remotely and still let you contact the real world but the outside<br>
world you would rather manipulate quite easily with nanites so whats the<br>
point of going through all that stuff to create a humanoid drone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One thing I don't understand is why anyone could possibly want to live</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the physical real-world when they could have the chance to have their</i><br>
<i>&gt;wildest dreams come true in a virtual world.  In a virtual world there</i><br>
<i>&gt;are no laws of physics!  A person in a virtual world would be able to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything in any way in any form they wanted to be in.  There would be no</i><br>
<i>&gt;limits to the experiences which could be had or the accomplishments</i><br>
<i>&gt;which could be made!  Uploaded beings would think much faster than</i><br>
<i>&gt;fleshy beings and would therefore be able to accomplish anything that</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be accomplished in the real world in a tiny fraction of the time!</i><br>
<i>&gt;What would space exploration mean if people could be uploaded?  Couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;any of the current unmanned space probes that are currently in use be</i><br>
<i>&gt;used to ferry uploaded beings to the far reaches of the galaxy?  Isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;the major limiting factor on space travel today the problem of</i><br>
<i>&gt;sustaining the life of fleshy, oxygen-breathing, limited-life-span</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans?  If we get rid of the flesh we get rid of the barriers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;With all these things going for virtual worlds and uploading, I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;hard time comprehending how anyone would want to choose the limited,</i><br>
<i>&gt;constrained life of a fleshy, oxygen breathing, limited-life-span human.</i><br>
<p>
Thats funny, I think I've meantioned *ALL* this before but still some people<br>
don't get the idea. Oh well, maybe we should create an extropians<br>
mailinglist FAQ or do we have one? I'd love to create it if it hasn't<br>
already been done.<br>
