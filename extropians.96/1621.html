In the movie Virtuosity which featured transhumanist and extropian ideas<br>
such as nanotechnology also included a computer where the designs would<br>
evolve by biofeedback. The example they showed was of a woman who would<br>
become more and more attractive by evolving according to the person's<br>
biofeedback. How easily could this form of evolving art be accomplished and<br>
also is there a personal absolute asthetic point? Can something evolve and<br>
become more attractive forever or is their a hard limit on how attractive<br>
something can be? And if there is a hard limit what would be it's reaction<br>
on you? Incapacitating?<br>
