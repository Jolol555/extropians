<p>
I should have explained this point more -- I don't expect most people<br>
to start living with their parents, aunts, uncles, siblings,<br>
etc. Communes came close to the idea of a modern extended<br>
family. Their informalness made them fairly unworkable (I'm referring<br>
to my stereotypical image of a '60s hippie commune -- many of today's<br>
squatter "communities" have similar organizational problems).<br>
<p>
This brings me back to the idea of communities, which at one time (I<br>
believe) tended to be more supportive of individuals within those<br>
communities. This is in contrast to many suburban neighbourhoods where<br>
people may never meet their next-door neighbours. With the ever<br>
expanding communications technology available to us, the number of<br>
"real" communities a person is involved with, communities which can<br>
provide aid in times of need, increases from the one or two physical<br>
communities available to most people. I would call these (to continue<br>
overusing a word) "virtual" communities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; * community-level money systems which augment a more socialist (in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   true sense of the word) system. The exchange of goods for services,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   services for services, and goods for goods (i.e., barter) is very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Barter?  It may be efficient in the sense that the handling of money is </i><br>
<i>&gt; avoided, but this means that I would have to produce something which is </i><br>
<i>&gt; wanted or needed by everyone which I want or need anything from.  In many </i><br>
<i>&gt; fields, specialization is becoming more and more important because of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the complexity involved in many tasks.  It would difficult to imagine </i><br>
<i>&gt; how a brain surgeon would be able to trade his/her skills in order to </i><br>
<i>&gt; buy toothbrushes, lawn mowers, and kitchen appliences.  Would this brain </i><br>
<i>&gt; surgeon have to operate on the CEO of Sony in order to get a CD player?</i><br>
<p>
Well, beyond the fact that I wouldn't feel comfortable with a brain<br>
surgeon performing their art so they can buy a CD player, I never<br>
really suggested using barter to replace money, merely that money<br>
should play a less important role in people's lives than it does<br>
now. This relates directly towards the changing nature of work, and<br>
that we are moving into an economy where most work is dull and<br>
wasteful. Most products and services in the marketplace are an<br>
artifact of this.<br>
<p>
Money is a very useful abstraction. But that's all it is. Our society<br>
has made money it's centre, and this I see is the main problem. Most<br>
of my thinking on the subject is redesigning (or subverting) aspects<br>
of the economy in order to make play (instead of work) the centre. The<br>
most important thing I see is a need for a change of attitude.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's true that there are many people (including me) who consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; their career (or future career) to be a reward in and of itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's also true that many organizations are able to foster a feeling</i><br>
<i>&gt; of pride for the things that the organization produces and/or does.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, there's a rather large number of people out there who</i><br>
<i>&gt; perform their work simply for the "individual goal" of getting money</i><br>
<i>&gt; so that they can enhance other areas of their lives.  It seems that</i><br>
<i>&gt; these people wouldn't be working for a common goal.</i><br>
<p>
And as we move further into an economy where these people's jobs<br>
become automated or just disappear, where employment requirements are<br>
declining, where the buying power of the average person is declining,<br>
I have to wonder how long it is before they start realizing that life<br>
is for living. I'm also lucky in that the work I'm good at is one<br>
which I enjoy, and it gives me a decent standard of living. I'm also<br>
in one of the few sectors of the changing economy which is likely to<br>
stay around for awhile. But then I have other interests for which no<br>
one would pay me, that I can't spend as much time on as I'd like. This<br>
saddens me...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's important that everyone be able to provide goods and services</i><br>
<i>&gt; which can be traded for ANY other good or service.  Money is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; intermediary which currently allows us to do this.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If I have misinterpreted your plan for a socialist economy please</i><br>
<i>&gt; correct me.  I just don't see how the flexibility of money can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieved without some form of intermediary which has no intrinsic</i><br>
<i>&gt; value.</i><br>
<p>
I dislike the term "socialist economy", mostly because years of indoctrination have a pretty good stranglehold on some part of my brain. The flexibility of money is a good thing. I have a problem with the direction we (as a society) have let money take us<br>
. Finding alternatives is only possible if we have a clear picture of where we want to get to. It's those alternatives and discussion of them which interest me the most...<br>
