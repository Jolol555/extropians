Exactly.  Amazing, this is exactly the answer I was hoping to get.  <br>
This technique is also being developed on the macro level.  Research on <br>
sonic refrigeration is being done at the Naval Research Lab and in <br>
Japan.  Commercial refrigerators should be available soon if they aren't <br>
already.  I read about this about three or four years ago, and they said <br>
they were three years away from a commercial product.  <br>
<p>
Coming back to the cell.  A cruder form of this -- a sharpened rock  -- <br>
would be to design a protein that absorbs the vibrations of an adjacent <br>
protein in such a way as to calm it down, so to speak.  To damp out <br>
its vibrations.  To cancel its noise.  That would have the effect of <br>
cooling it.  <br>
<p>
This is basically a physics problem.  The fact that the vibrating <br>
structures are proteins doesn't really enter into it.  How does one design <br>
a vibrating structure that absorbs and damps out the vibrations of an <br>
adjacent structure?  <br>
