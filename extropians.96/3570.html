<i>&gt; The problem with your idea is in the implementation.  </i><br>
<p>
Certainly. Had it been easy i would have done it 12 years ago on my C64 :)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Developing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; tool/language as you have described it is in some ways the Holy Grail of</i><br>
<i>&gt; software development.   Almost by definition, having detailed control</i><br>
over<br>
<i>&gt; the operation and features of a piece of software will add complexity to</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; source code and development.</i><br>
<p>
Yes thats right. But in some obscure way the purpose of a high level<br>
language is not to make us able to do more. It is to make us able to do<br>
less, but do it more efficiently.<br>
<p>
Hardware - Binary code - Assembler language - c-code - multimedia tool<br>
<p>
As a software pro you certainly know about the different program levels.<br>
What i say is that it should be possible in some way to make a tool that<br>
will improve our tools for making tools. I could easily imagine languages<br>
like c++ or Java redone with a completely graphical interface that you<br>
could learn to use by using it. Done right it should speed up the software<br>
creation process. Perhaps it could even be so simple that artists and<br>
psychologist could use it to improve its own interface with. If this could<br>
be done recursively we could have a really strong tool in the end.<br>
Perhaps the tool could be so powerfull that it would be easy to make<br>
updates all the way back to the assmbly level.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At the same time, to have true freedom in application development, you</i><br>
must<br>
<i>&gt; be able to write the low-level code yourself and develop your own objects</i><br>
<i>&gt; from scratch.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes but it doesn't have to look like gibberish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Consider the mTropolis tool you described above Although, I have never</i><br>
used it, I <br>
<i>&gt; guarantee that it doesn't have all the features and options you would</i><br>
have if you coded &gt; the same application yourself using C++.  <br>
<p>
Thats right. and it isn't supposed to. It was just an example. But still<br>
it's a pretty amazing example of how good an interface for a programming<br>
language can be. if you have acces to a Mac try and download the trial<br>
version and you will se what i mean.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose you built a programming tool for building software at a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstracted level.  If you told it "Build me a wordprocessor", it would</i><br>
pop<br>
<i>&gt; out a wordprocessor</i><br>
<p>
No this wasn't what i meant. Tools/Languages like that has been around for<br>
a long time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The difficulty in software development isn't in the coding.  It is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; defining the features you want, the properties of these features, and how</i><br>
<i>&gt; the features interact with each other.  This engenders a level of</i><br>
complexity<br>
<i>&gt; that cannot be avoided.</i><br>
<p>
This is exactly what i mean. What i don't like about the traditional<br>
languages is that the interface between the tool and the user is so weak.<br>
The user has to know to much to use the tool. Its very nonintuitive.<br>
As far as i know no one has still to try to make a graphic programming tool<br>
that can be used for serious system development, and i don't mean something<br>
like Visual c++ or any of those kind of interfaces they are just a hack.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The limitation, therefore, isn't in the tools themselves, but in the</i><br>
ability<br>
<i>&gt; of humans to express exactly what they want the tools to do.</i><br>
<p>
I want the tools to help the humans express what they want. I want the tool<br>
to be something that you learn to use by using it.<br>
Everybody (almost) agrees that the GUI is a better way to comunicate with a<br>
computer than a command language. Everybody except system developers. Eh...<br>
things that makes you go hmmm...<br>
<p>
This way of thinking would move the problem of making powerfull software<br>
tools away from research and into engineering. That's two completely<br>
different things. Now maybe it wont work. It's so easy to go up the wrong<br>
path. But i still think it should be worth an effort.<br>
