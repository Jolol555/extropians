&lt;&lt;  Some people are victims of geography, some people are born handicapped. <br>
 Does that mean they should be ground up by the wheels of the capitalist <br>

<p>
Capitalism lets people free themselves from geography by creating means to<br>
move and choose where you want to go.  I don't know of any capitalistic<br>
society that forbids travel or even travel out of the capitalistic society.<br>
 I do however know that socialistic governments place travel restrictions<br>
even within their own borders.  In this way a capitalistic society is closer<br>
to libertarianism than a socialistic government.<br>
<p>
People born handicapped were killed in the (very socialistic) USSR and Nazi a<br>
Germany.  I don't know of any capitalistic government that has ever done<br>
that.  I fact there are many non-government groups in capitalistic countries<br>
that help the poor, handicapped, jobless, homeless.  I see no reason to go<br>
back to a socialistic government where those private groups are outlawed and<br>
only the government rules.  I don't see charities decreasing in capitalistic<br>
countries and see no reason why they would decrease in a<br>
libertarian-capitalist society.<br>
<p>
I have seen people "ground" into submission by governments but they always<br>
seem to be the socialist governments.  Socialist governments want all people<br>
to be equal, equally poor, starving, no rich at all.  The only exception I've<br>
seen is the Swiss were everyone is equally rich. They don't let anyone enter<br>
their country and become a citizen that is poor.<br>
<p>
Centralized government or centralized business is a great problem.  When<br>
either gets too much power the people can not negotiate a free and prosperous<br>
life.  Perhaps you are talking about "centralized (business monopoly)<br>
capitalism".  If so, we agree on that one point, at least.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Libertarianism would work if everybody could compete on fair <br>
 terms, &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Decentralization helps because it lets people negotiate their choices with<br>
many different other people.  The central authority does not control.  If you<br>
don't like the people you are dealing with, go to the next one.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;but they can't, so some are going to lose all the time. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
"Some people will lose all the time" to me is a meaningless statement.  Some<br>
people we call "just plain losers".  Some people are lazy, stupid or<br>
uneducated.  And, some people will not help themselves no matter what you do<br>
for them. <br>
<p>
Some people will not choose to help themselves no matter what you give them<br>
to make things equal.  Equality is not a stable state if people choose to<br>
work harder than other people.  Soon they gain the fruits of their labor and<br>
everything is unequal again (poorer vs. richer).  If one person learns more<br>
than the next. . . you no longer have intellectual equality (educated vs.<br>
uneducated).   China tried this and the educated scientists cleaned toilets.<br>
  Did the uneducated make a new scientific discoveries?  You should not force<br>
equality anymore than you force people to do anything else.  China had a<br>
disaster when they tried. They chose to stop the "inequality" of intellect.<br>
 Ironically they got an _Atlas Shrugged_Ayn Rand disaster of their own<br>
making.      <br>
<p>
Equality is not the answer.  It's too unstable.  The minute everything is<br>
equal, things change and the society spontaneously drifts out of that<br>
unstable state.  <br>
