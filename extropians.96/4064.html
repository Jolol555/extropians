If you say so, but I have no knowledge of that one way or the other.<br>

Excellent! Privacy laws do more harm than good. You should be free to find <br>
out everything you can about me, limited only by your abilities as an  <br>
investigator. If there is something that I don't want you to know about me  <br>
then it's my responsibility to put that information in a place where you  <br>
can't find it. If you're smarter than me and discover it despite my best  <br>
efforts then so be it, you beat me fair and square. <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Ah, but to your enemies, what YOU call privacy seems a lot                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;like concealing from them what they need to know about your                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;nefarious schemes and nasty conspiracies.   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I would certainly agree with that. I conclude that if I want privacy I  <br>
shouldn't count on third parties, especially government, to dole it out to  <br>
me as a favor, I've got to grab it.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;your "privacy" might be someone elses "unaccountability" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, it's possible.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;my freedom is enhanced by increasing your freedom.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not always, your "freedom" might be my "persecution", again there is no <br>
reason  to expect third parties to hand out freedom  if we are good little <br>
boys, like we might give a biscuit to a dog. If you want freedom the best one <br>
to give it to you is you.<br>

<i>                &gt;Of the five dangerous power centers in the world today,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;government, aristo-oligarchies, criminals, religions and the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;techno elite, you ONLY talk about government!  </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
In general I have absolutely no objection to power centers, they had to <br>
happen and some I am very fond of them, civilization would certainly be dead <br>
without them.  Aristo-oliga... I'm sorry that's too much of a tongue twister <br>
for me, Business drives the economy, Techno Elite drives Science and the only <br>
criminals I fear are the unorganized ones, the ones who will put a bullet in<br>
my brain because they don't like the way I part my hair. The power centers I <br>
dislike are the ones that force you to join, government and religion. In the <br>
western world only government, mostly. <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;there is all the world's difference between "privacy" and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;"freedom", even under your definition.                  </i><br>
<p>
I don't see how you could have one but not the other.           <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>               &gt;if I have freedom, under your definition, I can say what I                </i><br>
<i>               &gt;wish, argue among my fellow citizens, live my life </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And if I have privacy I can do all that and more, and it makes not the  <br>
slightest difference if my self proclaimed masters say I can or can not. <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;if I have privacy but no freedom, I have nothing.  I am a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;slave.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Big Brother can pass all the oppressive, genocidal, laws he wants to, if he  <br>
has no way of enforcing them, no way of knowing if I've broken the law or  <br>
not, then they can't cramp my style in the slightest. With the increasing  <br>
importance of the Black Market, the one true free market, governments will not <br>
be overthrown, they'll just become as irrelevant as The Flat Earth Society. <br>

<i>                &gt;idiotically  believe to be a tyranny.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
A straw man and very insulting. Nobody is defending Ted Kazinskis, certainly  <br>
nobody on the Extropian list, if he hadn't been caught some of us could have  <br>
been his victims.<br>
                   <br>

<i>                &gt;down and kill us all and our families. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And destroy all the worlds PC computers and shut down the Internet? Not <br>
impossible I suppose but pretty damn unlikely.<br>
                   <br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
You bet it will!! Government leaders will enthusiastically support your  <br>
proposal, well half of it anyway, the part about keeping their subjects under  <br>
constant surveillance. As for the other half:<br>
<p>
 " My fellow Americans, I am sure that very soon, real real soon, there will  <br>
 be a camera right here in my oval office so you can watch me conduct the   <br>
 business of this wonderful country, just as I can now watch each and every <br>
 one of you 24 hours a day 365 days a year. The day that you good, dear <br>
 wonderful people can scrutinize my every move will be the happiest day of my <br>
 life, and I mean that sincerely. Unfortunately there are evil men out there, <br>
 leaders of godless nations, who refuse to let me spy on them as is my right. If<br>
 they knew everything I was doing but I knew nothing about them it would give <br>
 them an unfair advantage. Please understand, I don't want to keep secretes <br>
 for you my dear wonderful friends, but only from bad men in foreign lands, <br>
 but to my everlasting sorrow I can't do one without the other. I am <br>
 heartsick.<br>
 There is another reason to preserve the privacy of the president, a reason <br>
 that would instantly convince my strongest critics. I do SO want to tell  <br>
 you what it is, but for National Security reasons I can't. Just trust me,  <br>
 it's a wonderful reason that would make you proud of this wonderful country <br>
 and its wonderful people. I'm sure this unfortunate situation is only <br>
 temporary and I can very soon tell you everything, in the meantime I want to <br>
 assure you that I will never lie to you, I am not a crook, I feel your <br>
 pain..."<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;You are making a grand prescription for how to cure a sick                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;society. Well, then show us examples that the prescription                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;has worked in even one patient before this.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
In the first place it's not a prescription it's a prediction, it matters not <br>
a bit if you or I or The President or The Pope thinks it's a good idea or not. <br>
In the second place I'm unable to find a precedent for the current situation <br>
because never before in human history has it been possible to instantly<br>
communicate with anybody on earth, even somebody on the other side of the <br>
planet, and be impossible for any other living being to know what you were <br>
sating. Never before did we know about DC nets and Steganography so you can't <br>
even tell who I'm talking to, much less what I'm saying. Never before has it <br>
been so easy to engage in regulatory arbitrage and put money in any place on<br>
Earth you have decided is most friendly to it, never before have we known how <br>
to make totally anonymous digital cash that is far more secure than paper <br>
money and can be sent out of the country over a wire.<br>
<p>
It is for these reasons that the central pillar of your argument, that privacy <br>
must invariably decay, is fatally flawed. You're the one trying pedal a <br>
prescription, personally I have grave doubts your snake oil would work, but it <br>
wouldn't matter even if it did because the medicine is impossible to obtain.<br>
