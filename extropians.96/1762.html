<i>&gt;Perhaps one could have a small extension of the browser that allows you </i><br>
<i>&gt;to add a page to your "reference bookmark file" that contains useful </i><br>
<i>&gt;pages. People could merge their bookmark files, creating a distributed, </i><br>
<i>&gt;growing, user-defined search-space for information that a personal search </i><br>
<i>&gt;engine could deal with. </i><br>
<p>
Speaking of web HTML code enhancements. I was pondering the idea of a tag<br>
that you would put in a referring page if that particular page has moved<br>
that would signal search tools to auto update their database to this new<br>
location as opposed to the link going dead. This way the neural pathways of<br>
the web-brain could 'learn' and alter the structure of the links themselves<br>
instead of merely discarding a link. This could be one step toward global<br>
internet AI. I remember I read a highly interesting essay from Principia<br>
Cybernetica dealing with this called "From Internet to Web Superbrain". Just<br>
imagine when we get more intelligent routers for the backbones and start<br>
bringing bio and eventually quantum processors on board? To add to this<br>
analogy, notice how the webbrain strengthens it's neuron pathways by, if a<br>
particular website is busy we upgrade the server speed to enable more people<br>
to access it or even more likely, upgrade the connection to the neuron (the<br>
network link). This is just more evidence that the internet is moving<br>
towards being a conscious entity. Right now, you could consider it in a<br>
non-self aware stage. I'm looking forward to it becoming a conscious SI entity!<br>
