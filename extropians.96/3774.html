That's an excellent point.  Although it's been said (probably not here)<br>
that 'Money is the root of all kinds of evil,' it's not as evil as many <br>
other 'Stabilizing Systems' in our society.  Granted, money's use of<br>
mismodelling or misrepresentation gives us diminishing returns, its <br>
returns aren't as diminishing as in our Litigation Industry, or <br>
our Let's-Repay-Evil-for-Evil Law Enforcement.<br>
<p>
One of the most stabilizing forces in Life is the system of Ownership.<br>
Life depends on certain resources, and if those resources are private, <br>
then our efforts in obtaining them aren't invalidated by those who would<br>
steal our rewards without the work.  Later, more abstract ideas have<br>
come to our benefit, like the ideas of Private and Public.<br>
<p>
I think that exploring the possibility of a Zer0-Cost-of-Living would<br>
be a noble, extropian pursuit.  We are truly free when we can live<br>
without being taxed for living.  Requirements imposed needlessly<br>
are not productive, so we ought to make sure that these costs are<br>
indeed necessary to treat the Sources of perishing, and not just the<br>
symptoms. (i.e. scarcity of resources)<br>
