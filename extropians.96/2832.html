<i>&gt; I think that the reason Lyle said what he did, is that he either lives</i><br>
<i>&gt; in one of those fairy land type countries, or he lives in an area where</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone is equally rude, so the rudeness of gov't employees seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather normal. </i><br>
<p>
Maybe it's just that I'm so truculent that other people seem nice by <br>
comparison.  ;-) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (BTW Lyle, do you live in New York?)  </i><br>
<p>
No, I live (most of the time) in California, that fairy-land country <br>
by the sea.  I've spent some time in New York.  It has its own kind of <br>
rudeness.  But I've been treated worse in Austin, Boulder, and Reno.  <br>
<p>
I think we are dealing in cliches and stereotypes here.  I'm trying to <br>
get away from that.  Texas has its own kind of rudeness, so does the <br>
northwest, so does California.  And many New Yorkers are surprisingly <br>
nice.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I read an article in the paper recently on how northerners here in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; US, typically from MA, NY, NJ, Chicago, and such, have an </i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely hard time adjusting to the politeness and freindliness </i><br>
<i>&gt; that many southerners naturally effuse. They think that if they are not </i><br>
<i>&gt; being treated like shit that someone is trying to get something from </i><br>
<i>&gt; them, or that they are wierd somehow.  </i><br>
<p>
There is probably some truth to this.  My relatives live in Arkansas and <br>
Louisiana, so that area is my second home.  Southerners are friendly, <br>
no doubt about it.  But I have been to Chicago a couple of times in the <br>
last few years, and found that the people there (the white people, at <br>
least) were also very friendly.  In fact I was a bit uncomfortable, being <br>
among friendly midwesterners with my standoffish west-coast habits.  <br>
(I also felt like I was going from a third-world city to a first-world city, <br>
but that's another story.)  <br>
<p>
Coming back to the original point:  You were saying that there is a <br>
causal relationship between (a) the fact that government agencies don't <br>
need to create happy customers, and (b) the level of rudeness in those <br>
agencies.  If people were rational, this causal relationship would exist, <br>
but in fact (in my experience at least) it doesn't exist.  I have found <br>
just as much rudeness, if not more, in department stores, drug stores, <br>
restaurants, and other businesses, even though they can't afford to lose <br>
customers.  It is a mistake to assume that people are more rational than <br>
they are.  <br>
