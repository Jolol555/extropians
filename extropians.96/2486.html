<i>&gt;Try to imagine that you, yourself, do die every night, and awaken each</i><br>
<i>&gt;morning as a new person, with only memories to link you to the person you</i><br>
<i>&gt;were before?  Is this possible?  How will it be different when someone with</i><br>
<i>&gt;your memories awakens as an upload?</i><br>
<p>
Damn I hate this thread due to the fact that this is scary shit! Especially<br>
the part about children afraid of falling asleep because they're stream of<br>
consciousness would end. I'm going to have a tough time going to sleep<br>
tonite.  If sleep=death then death wasn't all it was cracked up to be so<br>
perhaps there's no need to fear it.<br>
