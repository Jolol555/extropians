extropianism like a religion across the globe. Could work!"<br>
<p>
I think it will benefit of each of us to spread the Extropian memes to all <br>
people on Earth.  Not necessarily to have everyone identify themselves as <br>
"Extropian," but to have everyone working dilligently on increasing the amount <br>
of intelligence, creativity, happiness, etc. in their lives; all of the <br>
Extropian Values.  To infect someone with a meme, the meme must have qualities <br>
which help it to flourish in the individual's current memetic system.  There <br>
are no "one meme fits all" in memetic competition.  To really be effective at <br>
spreading our memes, we need to gain a deep understanding of people's belief <br>
systems, so that we can design memes that work WITH their belief systems, to <br>
transform them into something more Extropian.  It would be helpful for many of <br>
us to infiltrate various major world religions, gain an understanding of the <br>
people's psychology, their belief systems and so forth.  Then it would be good <br>
to write a few books, aimed at the people in the particular religion, written <br>
as though they are by an "insider" of the religion, but with the Extropian <br>
Values seamlessly mixed in with the traditional religious memes.  One way to <br>
do this is to highly emphasize the memes of the religion which are the most <br>
Extropian (such as, "God helps those who help themselves.") and ignore or <br>
downplay those which aren't.  The books need to be very compelling to the <br>
people in these religions so that they become widely read by the members of <br>
the religion and deeply embedded.<br>
	The point is not to convert everyone into born-again Extropians, but to help <br>
adjust people's belief systems so that they are *MORE* Extropian than they are <br>
now.  Infiltration and Subversion are winning tactics in memetic "warfare".  <br>
	Also, books which show the deep similarities between various religions are <br>
good to popularize among the members of the various religions, because it <br>
helps to lessen their attachment to the particular religion they're associated <br>
with and gets them to think more about common ideals and values than their <br>
superficial differences.  Just focusing people's minds more on the value level <br>
is good for Extropianism, because I think most, if not all, people value <br>
increasing their intelligence and happiness and so forth, and the clearer they <br>
are with themselves about their values, the more they will act according to <br>
those values and seek out information which will help them achieve their <br>
ideals.  If the more Extropian information tends to be more effective in <br>
helping people achieve their goals, then they will more consistently seek out <br>
Extropian information.<br>
