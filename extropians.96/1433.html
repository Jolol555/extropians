Sarah's wondering if she had an experience in virtual reality that was <br>
indistinguishable from an experience in "reality", would it lessen the effect?<br>
<p>
First off, all we have are experiences.  We have our sensory experiences, our <br>
thought experiences and our emotional experiences, and so forth.  Virtual <br>
reality (in its very advanced form) would be able to provide us with <br>
incredibly detailed sensory experience, with so much detail and realism that <br>
we would have no way to distinguish the experience from reality, since our <br>
realities are made entirely of our experiences (now, I'm not saying there's no <br>
objective world, I'm simply saying that each of our personal realities, that <br>
which we realize, is entirely made of experiences).  Now, the virtual reality <br>
that people usually talk about only provides sensory experience, so if you <br>
were thinking, "this isn't real; it's only virtual reality," THAT THINKING <br>
might lessen the experience for you, but if you jumped right in, which you <br>
probably would, since we're so accustomed to just accepting our sensory <br>
experiences as the real world anyway, it would seem entirely real.  But you <br>
COULD lessen the impact it had on you by constantly reminding yourself that it <br>
was "only" virtual reality.  So, for example, you could have a sexual <br>
experience with someone in very advanced virtual reality, and if you didn't <br>
keep reminding yourself that it was virtual reality it would seem just as real <br>
and wonderful as it would in real life.  In fact, you wouldn't be able to tell <br>
the difference.<br>
<p>
But perhaps one day, we will be able to provide ourselves with much more than <br>
sensory information.  Perhaps we will be able to provide ourselves with <br>
memories and belief systems and emotional responses, so that we could <br>
experience ourselves as being some other person, like a historical figure, or <br>
we could see what it's like to live in a certain time period and a certain <br>
lifestyle.  We could be totally immersed in that reality, and we would have no <br>
awareness that we were not who we believed ourselves to be.  In fact, most of <br>
the time, our simulated belief systems wouldn't even think to question that <br>
they are not really who they think they are, we'd just go on living in the <br>
simulation and having our experiences.<br>
<p>
Some people may even want to experience what its like to be an Extropian in <br>
1996.  They would see this very message on their computer screen as they were <br>
reading the Extropian e-mail, like they do every day.  They would totally <br>
believe that they were really living in 1996, thinking about these Extropian <br>
ideas, working on creating a better future.  Seeing this particular message <br>
might make them wonder if, just perhaps, all they're experiencing, including <br>
all their belief systems and their ways of thinking, their memories, <br>
everything, is only a simulation.  And perhaps this message was inserted into <br>
their reality by the system manager to help remind them that it's time to wake <br>
up now, that it's time to come out of the simulation.  But of course, they'll <br>
dismiss the idea as being interesting, yes, but most likely not true, just <br>
like you're doing right now.  In fact, their belief system would probably be <br>
very similar to yours; they might even think they really are you.  And no <br>
matter how much anyone tried to convice them that their entire reality was <br>
simulated, they would think the entire notion just as ridiculous as you would <br>
right now if I told you that your reality is a computer simulation.  They <br>
would think, yeah right, David Musick's just trying to fuck with my mind.  But <br>
they would have no way to be sure.  All their memories and belief structures <br>
and experiences are provided to them by the computer.  Everything you have <br>
available to use as a tool to explore your reality further, to see whether it <br>
really is a computer simulation or not, is provided to you by the computer.<br>
<p>
If virtual reality can provide you with a total experience that seems as real <br>
to you in every way that your present reality does, then I think you can <br>
imagine its power.  Perhaps you are experiencing it already.  Perhaps you are <br>
really a transhuman space colonist, studying history, by experiencing what <br>
it's like to live as various people.  And perhaps now you are experiencing <br>
what it's like to be the person who is reading this message right now.<br>
