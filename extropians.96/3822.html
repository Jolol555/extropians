If I may add my 2 cents worth, I feel a rant coming on...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;decay as the rich, mighty, and a techno-elite gain powers I can never hope</i><br>
<i>&gt;to match.  Faced with the inevitable futility of wearing armor plate, I ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be armed with a light saber, for my own freedom and safety's sake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Every tyranny in history based its power first and foremost on denying</i><br>
<i>&gt;outsiders the ability to see the in-group's machinations.  We all</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctively fear this, and so each political wedge in society strives to</i><br>
<i>&gt;deny secrecy to its foes, whom they perceive as scheming conspirators.</i><br>
<p>
The only "in-group" I'm afraid of is the one that claims<br>
to have the right to control my life by forcing me to pay taxes,<br>
by telling me what I can or cannot do with my own body, my<br>
property, my business, what I can't or cannot say...corporations<br>
create things and then sells them to me.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Finney certainly feels this way about government agencies, for instance,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and supports all the secrecy-denying tools we have imposed on bureaucrats,</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the Freedom of Info act to open meetings laws, etc.  He does not see</i><br>
<i>&gt;this as denying them 'privacy', naturally.  They are his enemies and don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;deserve any!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Likewise, a person of the moderate left, who worries about conspiratorial</i><br>
<i>&gt;oligarchs, might want similar windows into the secretive inner world of</i><br>
<i>&gt;corporate management, where cheating and capricious abuses of power are</i><br>
<i>&gt;rampant.  Am I right in positing that Finney would defend to the </i><br>
<p>
You mean like in major churches, large charitable organizations,<br>
special interest groups and political parties both right and left? The<br>
"moderate left" are just as selectively naive as you accuse Finney of being<br>
when it comes to the power wielded by large organizations;  the problem is<br>
one of subsuming the rights<br>
of the individual to the rights of a collective body due to political fiat;<br>
the solution is de-politicizing all sectors of society, not to blindly wail<br>
away against one example of abuse based on century-old teleological<br>
Marxist rhetoric...<br>
<p>
death the<br>
<i>&gt;right of these lords of capital to evade scrutiny, even though</i><br>
<i>&gt;conspiratorial aristocrats destroyed more freedom in history than</i><br>
<i>&gt;bureaucrats ever have?  Too bad, Ben. The recent Texaco Tapes scandal shows</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the electronic light is starting to shine into boardrooms, as video</i><br>
<i>&gt;cameras shine on cops, etc.</i><br>
<p>
"Lords of Capital" - oh save me, they might spend money<br>
or heaven forbid - create jobs!<br>
Someone who violates my rights in committing a criminal<br>
act is a criminal.  I don't care if its you, a corporation,<br>
or government.  Governments proper role is watching for<br>
criminal activities at all levels.  Corporate abuse stems<br>
from the fact that corporations are granted more power than<br>
the individuals that comprise them through government-granted<br>
charters and politically won favors.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(In other words, the Transparent Society MAY happen without us having to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything at all.  It may be inevitable.  But I tend to be suspicious of</i><br>
<i>&gt;teleology, so let's continue.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oddly enough, the only power center to be COOPERATIVE about increased</i><br>
<i>&gt;openness has been the federal government, which yearly opens more of its</i><br>
<i>&gt;deliberations and processes to public view, an irony the cypherpunks seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;incapable of perceiving.</i><br>
<p>
Is that why its illegal to export PGP? In Canada it has been until very<br>
recently illegal to own a miniature satellite dish. There was a moratorium<br>
of private fibre optic line installation. The CRTC attempted several times<br>
to ban the use of<br>
modems on private telephone lines. I've heard from  severeal sources of 120<br>
channels of satellite TV just "disappearing" (Jamming isn't such a lost<br>
art).  I'm not kidding<br>
here folks, its damn scary, the threat is there and it isn't coming from your<br>
neighborhood McDonalds or Walmart...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Their inability to see the hypocritical dilemma of privacy fetishism (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I get to look at my enemies but don't you DARE look at me!) is augmented by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the silliness of their claim to be brave, lonely rebels... when in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy fetishism is THE mass lemming political movement of the decade,</i><br>
<i>&gt;with nearly every self-righteous voice of left, right, up, down and silly</i><br>
<i>&gt;chanting the same rote mantra.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, they cannot cite a single example from human history in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom was enhanced by selling masks and chadors to the poor.  But you</i><br>
<i>&gt;point to ANY occasion when freedom increased in the world, and I'll show</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it happened in direct correlation with increased ability by the masses</i><br>
<i>&gt;to see what the mighty were doing.   Zero percent versus 100 percent is</i><br>
<i>&gt;pretty damn devastating.  As a protection of freedom, secrecy is no match</i><br>
<i>&gt;for transparency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robin, I do not insist that these are the only choices.  I maintain only</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the mighty have a window of opportunity in which they MAY be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;set up barriers against light.  Barriers that you and I cannot hope to</i><br>
<i>&gt;match, no matter how many PGP programs the cypherpunks tout.  WE </i><br>
will live<br>
<i>&gt;in glass houses, like it or not.  All I am asking is whether we should act</i><br>
<p>
Why would a major corporation, (assumes trends towards<br>
decentralization suddenly grind to a halt), spend thousands<br>
of dollars spying on me and you?  How would it look to<br>
the shareholders?  How is it improving there profit margin?<br>
What is stopping them from being caught? How could they<br>
use that information harm you in a serious (legal) way? <br>
A year or so ago McDonalds was sued for over a million<br>
dollars because someone spilt some coffee purchased there all over herself.<br>
I'm sure that same judge would look kindly on<br>
legions of corporate spies breaking into peoples private<br>
lives...<br>
Yes, I can just imagine those MEGA-MULTINATIONAL-ZAIBATSU<br>
corporations spending millions on cracking my firewalls,<br>
my PGP-encoded e-mail, bugging my phonelines, and setting up surveillance<br>
cameras to eke out my spending habits (uh-oh - that might give them the<br>
knowledge they need to better tailor there products to my needs!!!, or I<br>
guess if your cynical it would<br>
only change there "marketing strategy"...) On the other hand, any IRS<br>
bureaucrat would have nightmares about millions of people using untracable<br>
e-cash.  Further,<br>
they possess the power not just of having access to better means of privacy,<br>
but have the right to take it away from whomever they please, and have come<br>
close<br>
to having that power several times but were denied it by the supreme court<br>
(Clipper, Exxon Bill).  Libertarians like myself don't want to keep on<br>
governments back because<br>
were afraid they're doing something naughty, we want to watch them because<br>
of the countless ways they might do what they have always done and<br>
overstepped there <br>
bounds...<br>
<p>
I've heard it all before when cars were invented, it was "only the rich"<br>
that would<br>
have them.  When the TV was invented, it was "only the rich" that would have<br>
them. When computers came out, it was only the biggest corporations that<br>
would own them.  All these<br>
statements proved more or less true, but with one strange caveat - they were<br>
only true for the most socialist states, and were spectacularily misproven<br>
in the western (relatively) market economies. The same is true of new<br>
privacy techniques.  Yes, corporations might get these things before most of<br>
us, they might get better<br>
versions before us, but if you look at the type of privacy you had, before<br>
and after the computer revolutions we're seeing today (despite how the<br>
government tries to stop us),<br>
you can only conclude we're all better off for it. (If you don't find the<br>
very notion of individuals having strong privacy repulsive from the<br>
outset...If so, I suggest you move to communist China, and I'm sorry you<br>
couldn't have enjoyed life under Hitler) <br>
Also interesting is that there are many examples of teenage hackers breaking<br>
into huge corporations and banks;  there's an entire subculture centered<br>
around it. Yet I have<br>
yet to see any consistent evidence for the the reverse...probably something<br>
to do with corporations being too busy making money...<br>
