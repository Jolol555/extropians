&lt;&lt; Look at United Fruit. They get cheap labour and produce from central <br>
 america, and they have a rich market here. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm sorry but labor has always been cheaper outside the U.S.   Perhaps I<br>
should hire MORE _expensive_ labor and go out of business faster.  Where<br>
would you have me go to get fruit?  All I have to do is get fruit to in<br>
winter?  <br>
<p>
I worked for Dole and I quit.  But, the non-American employees were not<br>
treated any differently.  We all liked working for Dole until something<br>
better came along.  Then we quit.   At Dolefil and Dolethai we were the<br>
"richest" people around because we were employees of Dole.  We negotiated a<br>
better deal with Dole than anything else we could do at the time.   Now we<br>
can negotiate even better deals because we worked at Dole in the past.<br>
 What's wrong with that?  I want to support myself.  Dole wins, I win and<br>
Dole's customer's win.  Everybody wins.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Buy low, sell high, a maxim of capitalism. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Prices are negotiated not mandated (unless by socialist governments).  The<br>
buyer and seller have to be satisfied or there is NO deal.  The maxim "buy<br>
low, sell high" is a nice fantasy.  Probability of this is very low because<br>
it is a lose-win (see Game Theory: Prisoner's Dilemma contests).   Win-win<br>
deals survive better overtime.   <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Doesn't (m)atter how many people they suppress <br>
 down there, as long as we get our cheap fruit.<br>
<p>
Suppress them???  You mean give jobs, education, housing, meals and money to<br>
them?  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  How many children don't  get an education &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
How many children didn't get an education before?  How many _American_ farm<br>
children didn't get an education UNTIL there were large corporations and<br>
other alternatives to farming?  ZERO.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;because they have to work in sweatshops in order to  support themselves. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
You call them "sweatshops". . .  I call them jobs.  Jobs they are free to<br>
take or not.  They take the jobs because the "sweat" is worst in ALL the<br>
alternatives.<br>
<p>
"Support themselves"?   What's wrong with "supporting yourself"?  What where<br>
they doing before?  Not supporting themselves?  Parasites? No they were<br>
farmers and worked very hard too.  Doesn't a farmer "SWEAT"?<br>
<p>
They must think working for the corporation is better than before.  Better<br>
than farming for themselves. Or, they would quit.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;India is a good example of capitalism running amuck.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
What!?  Why?  About 2000 farmers apply for every one (1) job opening in the<br>
Union Carbide Corporation even after the disaster.   Those 2000 farmers had<br>
it so good as farmers they _wanted_ to be punished?  They _wanted_ to have<br>
capitalism run amuck on them?  I don't think so. <br>
 <br>
Without capitalism they would have a better education system than they have<br>
now?  I don't think so.  <br>
