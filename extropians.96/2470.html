If something thinks it is me, has my memories, is thinking my thoughts and  <br>

If my consciousness is a "stream" it is a stream undergoing extreme <br>
turbulence, it bounces from one thing to another, doesn't seem to hurt me <br>
though, I'm the same man I was yesterday, I think.<br>

                  <br>
<p>
It seems to me you could make exactly the same argument if you said  <br>
information always moves and can never be brought to a halt, which leads me <br>
to think this is not a fruitful avenue to pursue. <br>

                   <br>
<p>
I think it's very meaningful. After Turing machine A produces an output <br>
there will be a delay before Turing machine B can use it, this delay is <br>
proportional to the distance between A and B.<br>
                   <br>

                   <br>
<p>
I very much doubt such a murky idea can even be expressed mathematically,  <br>
much less be proved or disproved.<br>

                   <br>
<p>
Every time the telephone rings my stream of consciousness is interrupted, <br>
when you read this post your consciousness is different than it would be if <br>
you were reading another post. I don't see why that is such a big deal that <br>
it makes us different people.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;If consciousness is based upon information and information                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;processing, my above statements  hold.                  </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Unless the religious people are right, consciousness must be based on  <br>
information processing, that's why I don't understand your theory. You're  <br>
saying, I think, that information exists outside our physical universe, <br>
if so  then the information in my head and the information in my upload a <br>
thousand  miles away must be the same, after all you also say " a physical<br>
translation  in space of the substrate is irrelevant".  Also, I don't see why <br>
you keep distinguishing between "originals" and "copies", if your theory is <br>
right then everything in the physical universe is a "copy".   <br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;There can be many instances of a single brain, each with its                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;own consciousness.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Yes, I believe it would be possible in theory for a brain to generate more  <br>
than one consciousness, and I think it's possible for one consciousness to <br>
run  on several brains.                <br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Information is only encoded on objects that exist in the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;physical universe.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't understand why you say "only encoded" like it's not important, <br>
because you also say "For information to exist, it must be encoded on a <br>
substrate".      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;If every piece of substrate containing a specific piece of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;information is destroyed, the information is destroyed                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;permanently. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not necessarily. It would be difficult to destroy the information that  <br>
2 + 2 = 4 because nobody knows where or how it's encoded. Even Shakespeare's <br>
plays could be rediscovered by a monkey banging on a typewriter,  it would <br>
take a long time, but not an infinitely long time. <br>
<p>
To my mind this does indeed give some support to the idea that information  <br>
can exist external to the physical universe, but certainly not to the idea  <br>
that there is a fundamental difference between a copy and an original or that  <br>
exactly the same information can't be encoded in 2 very different ways.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;although our intelligence could be extended fairly easily,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;our consciousness is irremovably tied to the overall                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;structure of our brain.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think that intelligent behavior and consciousness must be inextricably <br>
linked, otherwise I don't see why we would be aware at all. However important <br>
subjective feelings may be to us, Evolution is only interested in behavior <br>
because only behavior enhances survival. Evolution would never have given us<br>
consciousness unless it was needed for intelligence, that's one reason I <br>
think the Turing Test works.<br>
