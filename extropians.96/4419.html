&lt;I, and I think many others here, think that there isn't much we can <br>
do to prevent both encryption *and* webcams becomeing widespread. Much <br>
greater privacy in cyberspace, and much less privacy in the physical <br>
world.  The interesting question is then: what does this imply about <br>
life in such a world?&gt;<br>
<p>
Here's something tangentially relevant to this that I quoted before <br>
from the October (Nov?) Mondo 2000, from an interview with Mark Pesce, <br>
co-inventor of VRML, where he talks about "cyber ecology" and VR on <br>
the Web:<br>
&lt;The idea is to take the original database - which is the planet - and <br>
establish a superstructure for people to recreate the planet <br>
collaboratively on the Web ... We're opening ourselves up to <br>
mediations that can mutate ... they can start leading us around ... to <br>
create harmony between what's in and what's out, and it appears <br>
they're somewhat reflective ... Perhaps the Internet will serve as a <br>
reality condom [so that we can] spend our time in the real world as <br>
sacred time.&gt;<br>
<p>
Like Brin, Pesce has the idea that the physical and socio/economic <br>
world is in sorry shape. I'm also not sure if he's implying some kind <br>
of schizoid 'sacred time' in one medium (physical world) but 'some <br>
other kind of time' in the other (cyberspace).<br>
<p>

P.S. There's probably discussion on this issue on the www.minds.com <br>
(Electric Minds forum, which I haven't checked in a while) where Pesce <br>
and others, like Howard Rheingold, are contributors/directors.<br>
