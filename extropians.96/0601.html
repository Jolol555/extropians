<i>&gt;I simply take issue with those whose</i><br>
<i>&gt;first impulse in such situations is to call on someone else to do the</i><br>
<i>&gt;work of representation for them.  This was directed at Chris, not Max.</i><br>
<p>
I was not calling on someone else! I wanted him to be welcomed to the<br>
mailinglist and newsgroup by the what could be called press representative<br>
and founder of the extropians and in this way flatter him while welcoming<br>
him to the group. But you have to turn this little deal into a whole big<br>
mess don't you?<br>
