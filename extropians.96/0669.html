Exactly. And this will no doubt cause some interesting social effects. In<br>
a sf story I read a *long* time ago, there was a mention of the period<br>
just before immortality became practical - the entire world knew it was<br>
coming in a matter of months, and people lived very carefully, almost in a<br>
state of hopeful meditation (except for some, who celebrated it by risking<br>
their lives "for the sake of all who died before us"). <br>
<p>
In an immortal population, the ability to handle change will determine <br>
age-stratification. People who cannot adapt will remain in their own <br>
generation-culture, forming an ever growing set of relatively static <br>
cultures, while more flexible people will form their own system. The <br>
differences will become noticeable after a certain time.<br>
