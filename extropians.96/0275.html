I've been finding interest in extropian principles among people hanging<br>
around on IRC especially people who are knowledgable in computers, science,<br>
and technology. Maybe this should be a clue to creating an #extropians<br>
channel on undernet or possibly efnet due to less channel takeovers. The<br>
strategy of exposing these memes to the public rather than keeping them<br>
isolated within a mailinglist works quite well although we will have to deal<br>
with idiots occasionally. Educating people about ideas using this method has<br>
worked with the great religions of the world for quite sometime in the form<br>
of 'witnessing' as they call it.<br>
