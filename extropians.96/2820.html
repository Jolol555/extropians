Well, now that we all know that there is interest in this idea, perhaps we<br>
need a linguist to help us in constructing one and I know there MUST be a<br>
linguist on the list here. Also with enhanced reality it we may be able to<br>
communicate more effectively by merely playing back a video clip of an<br>
event in your life to the other person so they can see for themselves. In a<br>
visual based language we should assign multiple meanings for each human<br>
sense to a specific 3D model. This allows us more flexibility with less<br>
characters but more information being communicated. To universalize these<br>
characters we could link to them with urls so that the same image is<br>
retrieved from a central source so that we can universalize the characters<br>
and so that multiple dialects don't arise. In a line I read from snow<br>
crash, languages seem to break apart into multiple dialects rather than<br>
unify, so it's best to centralize the language but allow for unlimited<br>
character combinations and voting on new character types so allow evolution<br>
and flexibility of the language.<br>
