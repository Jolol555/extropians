<p>
        In Louisville, Kentucky, two men, Fadel Salem and <br>
        Mohammad Khalid, were recently released after serv-<br>
        ing two days in jail for what police believed was <br>
        cocaine but turned out not to be [1].<br>
<p>
        The men were held in prison until the lab tests <br>
        confirmed that the "fist-sized white chunks pack-<br>
        aged in plastic" were not cocaine, whereupon the <br>
        judge ordered that the suspects be released. <br>
<p>
        The two men spent their two days behind bars <br>
        trying to convince the police that the assumed <br>
        contraband was powdered yogurt, which is apparent-<br>
        ly often sold in this fashion in Middle Eastern <br>
        stores. The police dog is also reported to have<br>
        indicated a "hit" on the packages.  More likely <br>
        this "hit" was simply the dogs way of saying, <br>
        "Mmmm, that smells good, I want some."<br>
<p>
        These men, caught in the middle of the insane<br>
        war on powdered substances and dried flowers<br>
        should sue the police department for wrongful<br>
        arrest and imprisonment. How should it be that<br>
        a dog's taste for yogurt should ever result in<br>
        people being locked in a cage? Insanity defined.<br>
