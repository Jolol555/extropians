As a veteran of Microsoft since 1981, it was interesting for me to watch<br>
the spread of pro- and anti-Microsoft memes through the general public<br>
during the last 15 years. Howard Bloom, in his excellent book "The<br>
Lucifer Principle," demonstrates that people seem to have an innate<br>
"us-vs.-them" instinct that induces group identification and inter-group<br>
hatred.<br>
<p>
At first, no one had heard of us. Then, when the IBM-PC came out, people<br>
were delighted that a little software company in Seattle was doing the<br>
software for it instead of having to totally rely on Big Blue.<br>
<p>
But when Microsoft started getting bigger and bigger, people started<br>
getting worried. Now they said it should have been Digital Research to<br>
do DOS. There was a great letter to the editor in the Seattle Times<br>
suggesting that poor Tim Paterson, original author of DOS, was paid a<br>
pittance for it and is probably somewhere on the streets of Seattle with<br>
a tin cup. Tim wrote a nice letter back, assuring people that he was<br>
happily employed by Microsoft and was treated quite well. To this day,<br>
though, a tin cup hangs from his office door.<br>
<p>
(If any of you wants to write a similar letter accusing Microsoft of<br>
evilly growing Word into a billion-dollar business while leaving me, the<br>
original author, to rot in my tiny penthouse apartment overlooking<br>
Elliott Bay, feel free...)<br>
<p>
Bloom goes on to say that when a sign of weakness is shown in a dominant<br>
group, the next group in line moves in for the kill, often brutally.<br>
There was an attempt (in the public opinion only, really) to do this<br>
when rumors of bugs in Windows 95 came out. I've never heard so much<br>
anti-Microsoft posturing and vituperation!<br>
<p>
One ironic note in the Apple-vs.-Microsoft struggle is that many people<br>
don't realize that Microsoft is and always has been the No.1 vendor of<br>
Mac software! We put IBM software on hold in the mid-'80s to do Mac<br>
first.<br>
<p>
It continues to boggle my mind that people have the impression that<br>
Microsoft is (a) stupid, (b) not innovative, or (c) undeserving of<br>
success. It IS quite a harsh place to work, but it's certainly not any<br>
of those others.<br>
<p>

Yup - see the pointer below. Also, if you're interested in The Lucifer<br>
Principle, I have a brief review along with other memetics-related books<br>
at The Amazon.Com Memetics Bookstore which I maintain:<br>
