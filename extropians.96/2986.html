If you are still growing, they might work. Otherwise there is a risk that<br>
you become somewhat acromegalous, which isn't aesthetic or healthy. <br>

You could try eating better (if you don't), good nutrition (especially <br>
protein) increases height. But it might be hard to do much change right <br>
now, such things take time.<br>
<p>
I have heard about methods of lengthening bones by inserting screws into <br>
them linked by pressuring beams, but it doesn't sound like anything I <br>
would like to try. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I think it is hard to drastically increase height at your <br>
age, but it is definitely possible to lay the groundwork for greater <br>
adult muscle mass by training in this period; if you can't get much <br>
height, why not try breadth? <br>
