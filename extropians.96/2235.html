<i>&gt;You see, Chris, I am someone who has a great interest in creating things in </i><br>
<i>&gt;many areas of art, icluding mechanical engineering, graphic arts, computer </i><br>
<i>&gt;science, music, philosophy, drama,  mathematics, writing and physics.  So I </i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't fit anywhere in your classification scheme of 'artists' vs. </i><br>
<i>&gt;'engineers'.  I am both.  I want to express my personal values and desires </i><br>
<i>&gt;through many different media and through many different modes of thinking.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Sometimes I like to express my values through music, sometimes through </i><br>
<i>&gt;writing, sometimes through sculpture, sometimes through mathematics, sometimes </i><br>
<i>&gt;through philosophy, and there are many other forms of expression that I enjoy </i><br>
<i>&gt;engaging in.  Many dichotomies that people make are inappropriate to make </i><br>
<i>&gt;because they don't respect the real state of things, and I think the </i><br>
<i>&gt;left-brain vs. right-brain dichotomy is inappropriate.</i><br>
<p>
Than perhaps you're flat out dead middle-brain? Which is of course the best<br>
of both. Are you sure people use both but don't some people use one side<br>
more frequently than the other or process more data on a specific side? This<br>
explains why many math teachers can't draw worth #@%# and have horrible<br>
spelling whereas many english teachers are horrible at math and science.<br>
This also explains why left siders can be more introverts (tesla?) and right<br>
siders more extroverts.<br>
