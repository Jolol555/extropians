  This "altruism" often puts "interests" of God, "potential life forms"<br>
and other questionable entities over the interests of people.  Similarly,<br>
I would not consider the idea of feeding people to worms altruistic, even<br>
if it is shared by a human.  Actually, I do not care who carries the idea,<br>
and whether the carrier benefits from it.  If *I* lose from it, I do not<br>
like it.  If at the same time nobody I care about would gain from an idea,<br>
I would definitely oppose it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How do you like being part of the "stupid masses"?</i><br>
<p>
I'd be delighted.  I surrender my opinions to those of more competent<br>
people many times a day - and let people produce things and services<br>
for me.  As the result, I get much better food, appliances or software<br>
that I would be able to make on my own.  I just want to make sure that<br>
I like the results.  I would volunteer my advice to the cook, the plumber,<br>
the artist, the actor, or whoever ONLY if I think this advice could<br>
be valuable - and this is not often at all.  I would gladly surrender<br>
my rights in organizing PPLs to David Friedman and Tom Morrow (well, maybe,<br>
with a little input ;-) , hand over my voting rights on digicash security<br>
issues to cypherpunks, etc. - and would take responsibility for this<br>
delegation of control.  I would entirely surrender my rights to control<br>
the issues that do not touch me and that I do not understand -  because<br>
I have too little interest in them to justify the responsibility that<br>
may follow out of wrong decisions I may make.<br>
  Many people may be - and are - inclined to surrender the rights to<br>
control the manufacturing of social structures - as they surrender the<br>
rights to control the manufacturing of goods - as long as they can pick<br>
among the results for their personal consumption.  They may also get a<br>
better advice on how to lead their personal lives. And they can refuse it.<br>
And then be accountable - to themselves - for the consequences.<br>
