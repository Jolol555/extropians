          That would seem to be the only sensible thing to do, but <br>
          would it really help? If there is a solution that we can <br>
          figure out, and convince people of, it would seem unlikely <br>
          that not any of the millions of similar civilasations would <br>
          also have thought of it and implemented it. Is there any <br>
          reason to suppose that we could outwit doom when everybody <br>
          else failed? Perhaps, if we became convinced that the great <br>
          filter is in our immediate future, we should rather take a <br>
          chance and try to do something utterly absurd, something <br>
          that nobody else would have thought of? Like chopping off <br>
          the right arm of every newborn infant... (How would we <br>
          persuade the masses of the logic of this argument?)<br>
