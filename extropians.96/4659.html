I'm not so sure it would be bad, if you could decide for yourself what <br>
kind of borganism you would become. I think most of us regard the classic <br>
"resistance is futile, you will be assimilated" as bad, but there are <br>
nice possibilities for borganisms too:<br>
<p>
I have always wanted to do a lot of things: to learn to write calligraphy<br>
*well*, to develop huge artificial life simulations/entire universes,<br>
explore the Earth and the universe, teach and interact with children,<br>
compose grand symphonies, invent better ways to think and perceive the<br>
world, cook and eat delicious food, gather information into useful<br>
patterns, dedicate myself to studies in the occult, medicine, theoretical<br>
physics and... <br>
<p>
Obviously I can't do all this; even as a tremendously augmented <br>
transhuman I have just a single channel of consciousness, and many of <br>
these activities takes enormous amount of time and training. The only way <br>
I could ever get close to my wish would be to split into a lot of <br>
clones/copies/xoxes, and then each of them would face the same problem <br>
again: my calligraphy copy would soon want to *experience* the wonders <br>
the mystic copy did, who in turn would like to be able to cook the great <br>
food my cook copy created. <br>
<p>
The solution seems to be borganisation. If I could create/become a<br>
copy-clan where each dividual was an individual derived from me, and at<br>
the same time was linked into a kind of collective consciousness where<br>
skills, experiences and ideas could flow freely, then I could do<br>
everything (well, almost everything; I would have to wait for the Far Side<br>
Party to learn what my space selves had done). <br>
<p>
This multi-Anders would be a metaorganism, presumably with its own <br>
personality and goals derived from the interaction and multiplication of <br>
my current goals. Probably it would be intensely curious, sending out <br>
dividuals to study everything new and unusual, and very fond of <br>
interacting with other kinds of beings (on all orders, from the ants to <br>
other metaorganisms).<br>
<p>
So, to me being a borganism sounds like a great idea. As long as you can <br>
choose what kind of borganism it is and who it contains. <br>
