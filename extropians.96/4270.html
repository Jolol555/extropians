Hmmm...  Has there been many studies on psycho-temporal perceptions and<br>
phenomena?  Our perceptions are pretty easily twisted and modified once one<br>
understands the underlying mechanisms of our perceptions.<br>
<p>
Its been done for a long time with other perceptive mechanisms.  Think of<br>
graphic arts.  It took many years before human artists learned how to add<br>
spatial perception cues to their paintings.  If you look out really old<br>
paintings ( &lt;1000A.D. ), there is almost no spatial perspective.  Everything<br>
is very 2D.  The materials that people use to paint have not changed.  We<br>
still apply paint to 2D surfaces, but now we can add the perception of space<br>
to a painting via many mechanisms for triggering spatial perception cues.<br>
<p>
Much more recently in history, the study of psycho-acoustics has allowed us<br>
to generate acoustic cues that can modify the way we hear sound.  All the<br>
"3D" sound algorithms currently found in computer soundcards take advantage<br>
of some of the basic audio cues to fool you into thinking that you are<br>
hearing a sound from a source other than the originator.  Really good<br>
psycho-acoustic hardware can make you think you are hearing sounds anywhere<br>
in 3D space, all generated from 2 speakers using a complex barrage of clever<br>
perception cues.<br>
<p>
As for VR, experiments indicate that your body can fool itself into<br>
perceiving non-existant tactile and motion cues as well.  There have been<br>
many recorded instances of people "feeling" the impact of a moving object in<br>
an immersive VR environment.  The environment cues them to feel the object<br>
even though the object has no physical component.<br>
<p>
As for temporal perceptions, I don't think we know enough yet about temporal<br>
perceptions to develop environments that can significantly modify the<br>
temporal perceptions of a person intentionally.  However, the fact that<br>
certain conditions do appear to speed up or slow down actual time seems to<br>
indicate that such cues exist.<br>
<p>
An interesting question:  If there is a change in the _apparent_ flow of<br>
time, do our thought processes actually speed up or slow down?  When time is<br>
moving fast, do we actually think less?  I notice that time moves faster<br>
when we are significantly occupied mentally.  Is our temporal perception<br>
based on our level of CPU (brain) usage?  I imagine video games, which tend<br>
to accelerate time, are very intensive computationally for several parts of<br>
the brain, as well as requiring coordinated, parallel, real-time processing.<br>
It might be possible to speed up temporal perceptions by somehow inducing<br>
the subconscious to engage in a thought heavy activity.<br>
