<i>&gt; &gt;Computer power doubles every two years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Computer power doubles every two *subjective* years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Computer power goes to infinity four years after computer researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reach human equivalence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Mathematically, I believe it's called a "singularity".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You don't need enhanced smartness to outrun *any* task no matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*how* it scales up, all you need is recursive Moore's Law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Computer power does not equal smartness.</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't have to.  One of the necessary starting conditions for the <br>
above scenario is that computers be advanced enough to have <br>
intelligence roughly equivalent to human intelligence.  Beyond that, <br>
advances in speed alone will be enough to bring about the singularity <br>
even if no other fundamental improvement in intelligence is made.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. You'll need a bit more detailed argument to show that computer power</i><br>
<i>&gt;    doubles every two subjective years.</i><br>
<p>
I can see where the "doubles every two subjective years"  assumption <br>
might originate, but I also see that it has a significant flaw.  Right now, <br>
computers are being developed by human beings.  The intelligence of <br>
the human designers isn't based on the technology, and thus isn't <br>
increasing along with the increasing computing power.  Assuming that <br>
this is correct, it would stand to reason that if the intelligence <br>
(or just speed) of the designers were increasing right along with the <br>
technological advances, then the improvement that now occurs in two <br>
real years would accelerate in real time, staying constant in <br>
subjective time.<br>
<p>
The flaw in this is the assumption that the technology is not already <br>
contributing to its own advancement.  In reality, it is.  Although <br>
the machines aren't actually designing their successors, they are <br>
providing powerful tools that improve the human designers' speed<br>
and _effective_ intelligence by performing more and more of the <br>
routine tasks and by helping the designers manage the large quantities <br>
of information that they must deal with.  Hardware description <br>
languages &amp; compilers, sophisticated CAD/CAE tools with <br>
autorouters and design rule checkers, digital and analog simulators, <br>
thermal analysis tools -- All of these things contribute to the <br>
development of more sophisticated computers.  And all of these <br>
things then benefit from that advancement and it goes around the <br>
circle again.  Even mechanical CAD tools and "office" applications like <br>
spread sheets and database software contribute to it.  And on the <br>
software front, the same thing is happening with languages, compilers, <br>
code generators, etc.  It should also be noted that the number of <br>
designers working on the technology has also increased considerably <br>
over the last few decades, thus demonstrating yet another way in <br>
which the total intelligence developing computer technology has not <br>
been constant.<br>
<p>
The bottom line is that the "two subjective years" assumption is <br>
probably not correct.  My own inclination is that having intelligent <br>
machines involved in their own development will yield a curve similar <br>
to what we see now, possibly with a shorter, but still constant, time <br>
between each 2x increase in computing power.  And just as it is now, <br>
it will not be a very consistent curve.  It will have the usual lulls <br>
and occasional bursts when breakthroughs occur.  There does not <br>
appear to be any natural law behind the 2X in 2 years (or whatever it <br>
is) progress rate.  So even that is too much to assume, let alone <br>
assuming that it will be proportional to subjective years.<br>
<p>
The rate of improvement is likely to be very dramatic, but I don't <br>
think that a "singularity" is a valid assumption.  I can't say that it won't <br>
happen, but I don't think there is adequate cause to assume that it will.<br>
<p>
Still, no need to feel disappointed.  We're in for one heck of a ride <br>
into the very near future.  Like the old BTO song says: "B-b-b-baby <br>
you just ain't seen n-n-nuthin' yet<br>
