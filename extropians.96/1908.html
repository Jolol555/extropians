<i>&gt;colonized.  Life evolves to become efficiently-encoded information,</i><br>

<i>&gt;natural developments to expect.  The default scenario.  I would expect</i><br>
<i>&gt;a colonized universe to look exactly like a barren one.  So what was</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Fermi "paradox" again?</i><br>
<p>
If one looked at the inards of a very advanced computer, then if one<br>
intercepted a "long" communications channel, where the cost to<br>
transmit was large compared to computation costs at either end, then<br>
yes it should look like random noise relative to a high entropy state<br>
of that channel.  But this observation is a long way from showing that<br>
the innards of this computer should look like the stars and dirt we<br>
see.  As you point out, all that sunlight streaming away seems<br>
inefficient. <br>
<p>
I'd expect an advanced computer to notice if some external force<br>
started to much around with its innards, and to do something about it.<br>
So if the world around us is an advanced computer, it knows about us<br>
and chooses for some reason to allow our activities to continue.<br>
Either we are part of this computation, or it works around us.  <br>
<p>
How much physics do you know Steve?  I'm not sure you realize how very<br>
much we do know about all that information streaming around us.  We<br>
know which systems are exchanging bits with each other, and how fast,<br>
and where this arrangement changes, etc.  We also know a lot about<br>
designing computers, carefully arranging the routes and speeds of bit<br>
exchanges.  And these two really look nothing alike!  We can see<br>
nature's circuit diagram, even if we don't know what the bits<br>
"encode".  In particular, we can see the "short" communications<br>
channels, where we have no strong reason to expect noise-like bits.<br>
<p>
To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an<br>
optimum design for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.<br>
