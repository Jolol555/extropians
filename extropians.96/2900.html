John Clark said "Anarchy means no government," and Suresh Naidu responded, <br>
"Anarchy means no authority."<br>
<p>
John is very close, but Suresh is way off.  Anarchy means no coercion.  In a <br>
condition of anarchy, people would be voluntarily doing whatever they do; no <br>
one would be forced to do anything they did not want to by any one else.  The <br>
economic model in an anarchy could be socialistic, capitalistic, communistic, <br>
or whatever, but what makes it an anarchy is the fact that everyone <br>
participates voluntarily; no one is forced to participate.<br>
<p>
An anarchist is one who does not believe in, advocate or engage in forcing <br>
others to do anything against their will.<br>
<p>
There are different degrees of anarchists, from hard-core pacifists to <br>
totalitarian dictators and psychopathic annihilatists.  There are the <br>
pacifists, who won't use coercion even in self-defense.  There are the types <br>
of anarchists who will defend themselves with force, but not anyone else. Then <br>
there are libertarians, who let people do whatever they want to do as long as <br>
they aren't hurting anyone else.  Then there are people, who are fairly <br>
typical, who pretty much let people do what they want, as long as they pay <br>
taxes and obey the right laws and so forth. Then there are totalitarians, who <br>
let people do whatever they want as long as it's exactly what the totalitarian <br>
dictator wants them to do. ("You can do whatever you want, as long as it's <br>
what I want you to do")  Then there are the people who don't think we should <br>
exist at all, and thus have no choice about anything.<br>
<p>
I'm the kind of anarchist who will defend myself from attack, with deadly <br>
force, if necessary.  I am also inclined to defend people I love, if it <br>
doesn't endanger me too much and to defend strangers from attack, if it <br>
doesn't endanger or inconvenience me too much.<br>
<p>
I am dedicated to increasing extropy in myself and in the world.  I have a <br>
strong belief that people will be the most productive and achieve the swiftest <br>
progress when they think and act for themselves, of their own free will.  I <br>
seek to teach others how to think for themselves and to create for themselves <br>
the lives they want to live.  I believe that nearly all people will benefit <br>
greatly from allowing others a high degree of freedom, and I am working to <br>
spread that belief.<br>
<p>
I believe that coercion is entropic and that it slows down progress.  That is <br>
why I am against it.  My main commitment is to progress, and I view anything <br>
which interferes with progress as something to be overcome. (I define progress <br>
as an increase in extropy)<br>
