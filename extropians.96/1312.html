Yes, I've heard about all sorts of cover-ups.  What I have not heard are <br>
good reasons to believe that many of them have *are* cover-ups.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is everyone but Ian Goddard asleep on this list?  Or reading nothing but</i><br>

<p>
I'm proud to say that I'm reading nothing but science books.  Because of <br>
my interest in science, I have a lot of trouble with the sort of 'evidence' <br>
generally cited in support of conspiracy theories.  I think that makes <br>
me more awake, not 'asleep'.<br>

<i>&gt; Statist society.</i><br>
<p>
There's not much point in owning myself if I'm not worth much.  Most of my <br>
feelings of self-worth are based on an awareness that I try to think clearly, <br>
rationally, and skeptically.  I see no point at all in fantasizing 'enemies' <br>
just to make the prospect of self-ownership seem more precious.<br>
