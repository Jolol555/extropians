Regarding David Musick's "MOMM" idea, i.e. a private general social service<br>
intermediary agency: I've had a very similar idea before, when considering<br>
the great information filtering and assessment problems facing individuals in<br>
a stateless anarcho-capitalist society.  But what of the "transitional"<br>
question in a territory where individuals are still considered citizens of an<br>
existing state: Why should I pay a subscription fee (whether financed or not)<br>
to a "MOMM" _and_ pay taxes at the same time?  How can a "MOMM" provide<br>
enough benefit to offset the extra cost?<br>
