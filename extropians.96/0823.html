<p>
Highly unlikely, since cities are not built merely to facilitate <br>
meetings. High-quality infrastructure is expensive -- the more the <br>
structure deviates from a sphere, the larger is the average path length.<br>
Suburbia is an infraststructure cost (installation/repair) nightmare.<br>
 <br>
Though some teleworkers will relish the new freedom by moving into rural <br>
areas, further compaction of cities into virtually one huge building, a <br>
hierarchical assembly from pretty autark cells is desirable. Particulary, <br>
small diameters (reduced absolute travel distances, just a few km!) and <br>
introduction of crossing-free autorouting matrix traffic systems will <br>
make car city traffic obsolete.<br>
<p>
Ideally, one should use a two-component separable traffic system: a human <br>
container/cabin, owned by customer, spending its time mostly docked to <br>
the living area, and an automatically attachable/detachable carrier, which <br>
is owned by the service provider.<br>
<p>
Within the city, the carrier does not need but the (electrical) <br>
propulsion unit, utilizing energy grid infrastructure of the city.<br>
<p>
Different carrier structures for overland, air, etc. traffic are <br>
possible, changes occur transparently to the user. (The need for carrying <br>
one's environment has mostly psychological reasons).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      we present a model where individuals make contacts and choose</i><br>
<i>&gt;      whether to use electronic or face-to-face meetings in their</i><br>
<i>&gt;      interactions. Cities are modeled as a means of reducing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      fixed travel costs involved in face-to-face interactions.</i><br>
<p>
Signals, solids, gases and fluids and electricity have to travel as well. <br>
Shared infrastructure allows use of larger grains, which has a positive <br>
impact on price/performance ratio.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      When telecommunications technology improves, there are two</i><br>
<i>&gt;      opposing effects on cities and face-to-face interactions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;      some relationships that used to be face-to-face will be done</i><br>
<i>&gt;      electronically (an intuitive substitution effect), and some</i><br>
<i>&gt;      individuals will choose to make more contacts, many of which</i><br>
<i>&gt;      result in face-to-face interactions. Our empirical work</i><br>
<i>&gt;      suggests that telecommunications may be a complement or at</i><br>
<i>&gt;      least not a strong substitute for cities and face-to-face</i><br>
<i>&gt;      interactions. We also present simple models of learning in</i><br>

The human component cannot be left out from the equation: any <br>
infrastructure is useless if it lacks acceptance.<br>
