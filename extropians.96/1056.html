Yes, and such experimentation is often limited by ethical concerns.  In a<br>
wave-particle duality experiment, there are no moral issues hanging over<br>
whether you block slit "A" or slit "B".  In social experiments, one is<br>
necessarily restrained from trying all of the options.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...I'm not sure what you mean by "objective and repeatable" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;"limit the number of variables", so I can't yet compare them to your</i><br>
<i>&gt;criteria.  It is easy to limit the number of things you vary within</i><br>
<i>&gt;your experiment.  Bad experiments often vary too few things.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiments are commonly repeated to see if the same phenomena is observed.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not a research scientist, and I'm sure there are others on this list<br>
who can articulate this better than I.  By "objective," I mean that most<br>
reasonable people would agree the experiment is fair from the outset.  By<br>
"repeatable," I mean any disinterested party could recreate the experiment<br>
and come up with the same results.<br>
<p>
I'm not trying to suggest social scientists *always* have political<br>
agendas.  I'm saying it is extremely difficult, and often impossible, to<br>
design and implement social experiments that are as airtight as the best<br>
experiments in the physical sciences.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'll also note that many "sciences" such as astronomy and geology rely</i><br>
<i>&gt;almost entirely on observation.  Others, such as evolutionary biology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;find it very difficult to eliminate variance within the samples they</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment on.</i><br>
<p>
Nope, there is plenty of experimentation in astronomy and geology.  Didn't<br>
astronomers prove that gravity can bend light waves through an experiment?<br>
And there are many experiments one can do in geology, like mechanical<br>
simulations, drilling through the earth's crust, etc.<br>
<p>
But your point does make me realize that "observation" isn't the real issue<br>
here.  "Variables" is.<br>
<p>
In the physical sciences, you can usually test one variable at a time.  I<br>
don't dispute your claim that often you need to vary more than one thing at<br>
a time.  The point is you shouldn't start doing that until after you have a<br>
firm understanding (verified through experimentation) of what happens when<br>
you vary each thing alone.<br>
<p>
The problem with the social sciences is that there are external forces<br>
varying many things *all* of the time.  It's virtually impossible to<br>
isolate any single factor.  For example, how do you design a rigorous<br>
experiment to determine whether giving welfare to unwed, teenage mothers<br>
will reduce, increase, or have no impact on criminal activity among their<br>
children when they grow up?<br>
<p>
Perhaps my example is an extreme case.  Please tell me a little about your<br>
research.  I read your "Idea Futures" article and thought it was excellent;<br>
I'm even thinking about how your ideas might be applied to the cellular<br>
telephone technology wars I am participating in.<br>
