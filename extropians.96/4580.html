<i>&gt; Ever since I became a devout atheist ridding myself of the meme of</i><br>

<p>
Control (or Logic) and Creativity are often two different parts of the<br>
brain that should be taught to work in concert.  Science teaches us to <br>
require an unbroken chain of evidence. (Just try and PROVE the sky is <br>
blue.)  Religion tends to deal with the fuzzier logic of belief, sometimes<br>
accepting the most unrelated of associations. ("I saw Jesus' face in that<br>
marble pillar!")  Creativity is often more Religion than Science, or<br>
what is often called Right-Brain thinking, as opposed to Logical <br>
Left-Brain thinking.<br>
<p>
When you work only from proven logical sequences, you are in a <br>
creativity rut.  When you associate patterns more randomly, your <br>
creativity soars, but your credibility often goes out of check.<br>
When your creativity is checked by your logic, your dreams can <br>
find purpose in reality.  Likewise, your instinctive, fuzzy-logic, <br>
pattern matching association can unshackle your logical rut.<br>
The more that two work in concert, the more proficiently one invents.<br>
<p>
When I lost religion about a year-and-a-half ago, my creativity shot up,<br>
but my sense of security plummetted.  (An assured immortality makes <br>
for nice complacency, and when primal fear is introduced then creativity<br>
is called upon for survival.)  Perhaps this is different than a <br>
Creativity-Depression link you seek, but perhaps not.  Another link that<br>
fuels my creative fires is anger... Too many bossy people INVALIDATE what<br>
you've done or said, so it's time to SHOW THEM how USEFUL your skills<br>
and insights truly are.  This has driven me to some of my best inventions<br>
and creations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have been able to feel my creative side as though it were tangible </i><br>
<i>&gt; through certain types of music but can't quite grasp it. When</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was younger I used to be quite the horticulturist. Perhaps I need </i><br>
<i>&gt; to get back in touch with nature? Maybe I need to bring out my </i><br>
<i>&gt; creative side through mysticism such as wicca or other so-called </i><br>
<i>&gt; new age religions?</i><br>
<p>
I think those might have impact, but not so much because of their doctrine<br>
as their practical or sensational appeal.  When the show HERCULES first <br>
aired, there were many complaints that it wasn't 'accurate' to the<br>
historical, carved-in-stone Hercules seen in mythology.  In actuallity,<br>
much of its success is due to its shared dramatic and sensational appeal<br>
with its ancient namesake.  After all, what is mythology FOR?<br>
<p>
It seems the important part is to discern the rhetorical parts of religion <br>
from the useful bits.  I have no "Faith" in terms of blind belief, but that<br>
was never even called for to begin with.  I have Commitment to supporting<br>
the society of which I'm part, and that's the "Faith" which was called for.<br>
I still concider myself to be a Disciple of Jesus, although it is my belief<br>
that he was mortal, this despite his apparent resuscitated from near-death.<br>
(Funny, too, that a common pulpit illustration is the anecdote <br>
that Dead Men Don't Bleed.)  I feel you've got to admire a guy<br>
who teaches a bunch of fellow Jews to be more tollerant and accepting <br>
of one another, and to produce only good instead of repaying evil for<br>
evil.  I still wonder how much of this he may have learned directly from<br>
Socrates teachings.  And if his real focus was on the theraputic healing, <br>
humor, humanity, and heart-felt compassion instead of doctrinal issues,<br>
then why does the church go on building synagogs instead of theraputic<br>
baptismal bathhouses?!? (Asside from the Europeans fear that bathwater<br>
caused disease...)  I mean, don't they ever get it?<br>
But enough religion - I've REALLY digressed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Christianity was a tool that allowed a channel into my creative side. </i><br>
<i>&gt; With my increasing belief that things are ever more structuralized </i><br>
<i>&gt; and logical I seem to be losing creativity first and following that, </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotion. Maybe I need to surround myself with creative people and </i><br>
<i>&gt; artists and bring it back.  What do you suggest? Please help!</i><br>
<p>
 o  Creative friends do help... as do other sources of Inspiration.<br>
    (Plato records a good dialogue of Socrates called "Ion," in which <br>
     he concludes that we do not lead by some office or title, but<br>
     rather because we are "maddened by the divine inspiration of Muses.")<br>
<p>
 o  Don't create in a vacuum... Enrich your pool of experiences and <br>
    thoughts, so that your pattern-matching instincts can springboard <br>
    from a variety of stimulii.<br>
<p>
 o  Enjoy playing with Cause and Effect... it's the stuff from which we get <br>
    most of our learning and understanding.  Humor and Irony are also <br>
    helpful... they teach us to discern things that appear opposite on <br>
    the surface.<br>
<p>
 o  A "wicked good" book on creativy is Doug Hall's "JUMP START YOUR BRAIN."<br>
