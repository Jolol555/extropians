John Clark raised the ancient question why there's something rather than<br>
nothing, and offered several useful logic responses to it.  Here's my $2's<br>
worth (allowing for inflation):<br>
<p>
`Why is there any being at all and not rather nothing?' Heidegger asked<br>
(recalling Leibnez), unsatisfied with Kant's perfectly good answer that<br>
being is not a predicate but a precondition to questioning.  We can imagine<br>
a chair, or the colour red, or love, or the dimension of depth not existing.<br>
But I do not think we can imagine the annihilation of some abstract category<br>
`being' or even `Being'.  The closest we can come, I suspect, is the physics<br>
of the Big Bang, in which the fundamental symmetries of our spacetime frame<br>
are supposed (on some models) to have emerged from nothing as a kind of<br>
massively charged vacuum, which instantly started to break apart into a<br>
cascade of energy, fields and the laws determining their interaction.  Is<br>
that pregnant nothingness the same as Heidegger's Nothingness (Nichts)<br>
against which Being is meant to stand as an epiphany?  Significantly, recent<br>
attempts by Stephen Hawking and his colleagues to model a `wave function of<br>
the universe' propose to do away even with that time-before-time,<br>
postulating a quantally-smeared initial state, a curved spacetime boundary<br>
that literally prohibits any escape from the substrates of this universe<br>
(even if it produces an infinity of `baby universes' that extrude into their<br>
own separate reality via black holes).30  If such a mathematical program<br>
succeeds, it will help clarify the Kantian claim that `being', `is-ness',<br>
the existential copula, is finally no more than a convenience of language.<br>
<p>
But can either theoretical or empirical advances address ancient problems of<br>
metaphysics?  Quantum theory, asserts mathematician and theist Martin<br>
Gardner, `has shed no light on this question [the origin of `being'].  There<br>
is speculation that the universe started with a random quantum fluctuation<br>
in the false vacuum, but this vacuum has nothing to do with metaphysical<br>
"nothing".  The fluctuation presupposes quantum fields and laws, and laws of<br>
probability.  So the question is simple pushed down to a deeper level, but<br>
the problem of why there is something rather than nothing is as opaque as<br>
ever' (Gardner, 1992, p. 186).  This is unarguable for so long as we grant<br>
that universal `nothing' - an utterly timeless, spaceless, lawless void - is<br>
genuinely conceivable.  I do not think it is; I assert that any sentence<br>
proposing it either confuses universal nullity with an absence (perhaps<br>
intensely poignant) of some more limited state or structure, or rests on a<br>
verbal trick along the lines of the pseudo-question `what sort of person<br>
would I have been had my parents never met and so had produced quite<br>
different children?'  Such imagined offspring would have possessed, as<br>
Wittgenstein might have said, a `family resemblance' to my mother and hence<br>
to me, and to her imagined husband and hence to his children, but it doesn't<br>
help to speak about my actual being or imagined nothingness in musing on<br>
such conditionals.<br>
<p>
In short: when we say `It is raining', this sentence no more reveals a<br>
portentous `is' than an `it' doing the raining.  We could just as validly<br>
and completely state: `Rain now falls' or `Rain-fallingness 1.45 am in<br>
Brunswick'.<br>
