<i>&gt; Ever since I became a devout atheist ridding myself of the meme of</i><br>
<i>&gt; christianity I've funneled my creativity into logic while stifling it.</i><br>
<p>
It is a very common, dangerous, and insidious meme that somehow logic,<br>
science, and reason are incompatible with creativity, art, passion.<br>
I think you are suffering from that meme, and not allowing yourself<br>
to be creative because you mistaken believe art and science to be a<br>
dichotomy.  Religions might encourage that meme, because they can<br>
then steer people away from reason by telling them that it is "dry"<br>
or "unfulfilling" or some other slander, thus keeping them in their<br>
seats, looking at the pretty windows and putting their money in the<br>
collection plates.<br>
<p>
True reason /increases/ one's appreciation of beauty.  Are the stars<br>
on a clear night less magnificent because I happen to understand fusion?<br>
Is a rose less fragrant to a competent horticulturist, who knows that<br>
it got that way by grafting a fragrant scion to good wild root stock,<br>
then supplying it with a high-Phosphorus fertilizer?  Is life any less<br>
miraculous since Watson and Crick discovered DNA?<br>
<p>
Great art and great scientific genius often go together: Leonardo Da<br>
Vinci and Richard Feynmann may be remembered for different things, but<br>
they were both great scientists and great artists.  If you find that<br>
you are less creative, perhaps it is just that your "logic is not<br>
beautiful" meme is getting in the way.  Fight it, allow yourself to be<br>
as creative as you are, let nature--true, complete, understood nature;<br>
not just the vague abstract nature of the luddites--inspire you.  Don't<br>
sacrifice your mind or your art to the prejudices that were instilled<br>
in you by the enemies of reason.<br>
