        Perhaps I am being unknowingly ignorant by saying this, but even<br>
before I had any sort of 'individualism' morals or any knowledge of extropy<br>
and other things I know (and *don't* know) I have never been discriminatory<br>
toward any race or sex.  That is, of course, just speaking for myself.  I<br>
don't have any prejudice toward any large group until I find out what the<br>
group is about.  I like to treat people as individuals.  I didn't realize<br>
that there was any semblence of 'constructed gender differences' on this<br>
list; if such is true, then I truly don't understand what these differences<br>
are.  Perhaps that is your point.  As for overcoming such possible<br>
differences, I think a dose of *reality* would do the trick.<br>
