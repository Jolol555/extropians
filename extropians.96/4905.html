Does this gain you much? I was under the impression that the microkernel<br>
only gave you very limited non-portable facilities so that you could<br>
rapidly port most of your OS by rewriting the microkernel. I can't believe<br>
that all your device drivers fit in 12k. How often is the message-passing<br>
code called? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;, having an address in address space (cache</i><br>

<p>
Some chips let supervisor-mode software lock lines in the cache so that<br>
they always map to one specific address, effectively allowing you to use<br>
it as on-chip RAM. I'm fairly sure that the T9000 transputer can do this<br>
(I read the manual a few years ago), but I'm not sure about more common<br>
chips. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Taking this yet another step further:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Over the last fifteen years all major CPU makers have migrated from</i><br>

<p>
Are you sure of this? I thought the point of RISC was that with a<br>
simplified instruction set you eliminated the microcode and could increase<br>
the speed of your chips because the decoding overhead was reduced.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why in the world doesn't Motorola</i><br>
<i>&gt; or MIPS or whoever implement both x86 and 68000/PowerPC/MIPS instruction</i><br>
<i>&gt; set in a single chip!? </i><br>
<p>
Wasn't there a rumor of a combined PowerPC/486 chip from IBM a year or two<br>
ago? If Intel don't use microcode then you can probably forget any such<br>
combination, because it would be a huge chip. Even if it did then the cost<br>
of developing a Pentium clone would probably be prohibitive. I can't see<br>
Intel supporting the PowerPC chip by giving Motorola rights to the Pentium<br>
architecture, though they might be able to license the Cyrix or AMD<br>
clones. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Switch between the two with a protected</i><br>
<i>&gt; instruction. Run DOS on an SGI machine as a native OS, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; applications' sake. </i><br>
<p>
Even with a chip that can run Intel instructions you would still need to<br>
write a huge amount of code to emulate the rest of the PC hardware, or<br>
license Windows and DOS so that you could rewrite them in native code. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Bury the</i><br>
<i>&gt; inferior Intel architecture. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what's so inferior about it, except perhaps for floating<br>
point performance. As a programmer I much prefer the PowerPC architecture,<br>
but the Intel chips are fast and cheap in comparison. The theoretical<br>
advantages don't seem to matter so much in practice. <br>
