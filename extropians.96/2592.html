Here is a quick little thought experiment for everyone on this<br>
uploading/consciousness thread:<br>
<p>
Assume uploading actually moved your currently operating stream of<br>
consciousness to a computer.<br>
Suppose the upload apparatus was connected to a multiplexing device so that<br>
the upload data could be sent on two separate channels at the same time.<br>
Now suppose you have two different computers connected up to the two<br>
different channels.  Both computers reconstruct your stream of consciousness<br>
as though each was the only computer connected to the upload apparatus.<br>
<p>
If the apparatus is actually uploading *your* stream of consciousness, is it<br>
possible for it to exist in two places at the same time?<br>
<p>
Isn't having a single stream of consciousness and having two simultaneous<br>
instances of a single stream mutually exclusive?<br>
<p>
Which instance is really *your* stream of consciousness?<br>
<p>
