The real question is: where do we get our premises?  You are clearly better<br>
off if your premises come from understanding, not emotion.  The same goes<br>
for values.<br>

<p>
*BZZT*. Thank you for playing. <br>
<p>
Here's a trace of my parser at work:<br>
<p>
"You" -- pressumably you mean "any thinking being", correct?<br>
<p>
"are clearly"-- I take this to mean "would be undeniably"; fair?<br>
<p>
"better off" -- hmm, I have a hard time with this one. Leave it as an <br>
unassigned variable for the time being, push it on the stack and move <br>
on...<br>
<p>
"if your premises" -- in my reformulation, subjunctive: "were your <br>
premises".. but wait a minute here--what exactly is a premise, and <br>
how do I tell a premise from a preconception from a prejudice from a<br>
Kantian _a priori_? Hmm, stack time again.<br>
<p>
"come from understanding, not emotion" -- Whoa, red flag: parser error.<br>
What does this mean? <br>
<p>
Premises, aka axioms, aren't officially _from_ anywhere.<br>
<p>
The presupposition that there is no such thing as emotional <br>
understanding is totally unsupported. Further, the implicit notion that <br>
"premises" are _anything other than_ axioms, explanations or excuses leaves <br>
me utterly confused as to whether your utterance has any utility _or_ <br>
meaning.<br>
<p>
In other words, "say WHAT?" :) :)<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;<br>
Poor Bertrand Russell.  It is too late for him to disown such a foolish<br>
statement. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 But Ira, that means there's still time for you to disown _yours_! :) <br>

MMB, at but not for, etc.<br>
