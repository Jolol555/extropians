David Musick writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been contemplating the possibility that highly advanced beings </i><br>
<i>&gt; will eventually regard humans as useless and entropic and destroy the </i><br>
<i>&gt; humans. Eric Watt Forste has suggested that I consider the idea that </i><br>
<i>&gt; advanced beings may use humans as processors of certain types of </i><br>
<i>&gt; information, sort of like we use calculators now.</i><br>
<p>
Or like corporations use their employees; or like armies use soldiers.  <br>
It is instructive to substitute "corporation" for "being" in David's post, <br>
and see what the result looks like:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An advanced corporation who is wanting to design a very complex </i><br>
<i>&gt; system may subdivide the task into many parts and use human </i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers to complete various tasks...   There are many tasks which </i><br>
<i>&gt; humans are good at, and I can imagine very powerful corporations </i><br>
<i>&gt; hiring humans to complete various tasks as long as there wasn't a </i><br>
<i>&gt; more efficient device to carry out the task.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It seems to me that the most advanced and powerful corporations </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be those who are extremely adept at cooperating with as many </i><br>
<i>&gt; others as possible and assisting as many others as possible to advance </i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves as well so they are able to assist each other more </i><br>
<i>&gt; effectively and intelligently.  It seems to me that the most advanced </i><br>
<i>&gt; and powerful corporations will not be those who dominate and </i><br>
<i>&gt; control others, but those who are able to develop strong, mutually </i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficial relationships with as many others as possible.  I believe </i><br>
<i>&gt; that the most powerful and advanced corporations will be constantly </i><br>
<i>&gt; searching for ways to develop symbiotic (mutually beneficial) </i><br>
<i>&gt; relationships with as many other systems as possible.  I believe that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the most powerful corporations will eventually be those who are of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the greatest value to the largest number of systems.  Because they </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be of value to the most systems, they will have the greatest </i><br>
<i>&gt; number of systems working to help them accomplish their goals, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; because the ability to effectively achieve one's goals is what power </i><br>
<i>&gt; truly is, these corporations will be the most powerful corporations.</i><br>
<p>
An "advanced being" will necessarily use humans for various tasks.  <br>
An advanced being will amount to the same thing as a corporation (or <br>
possibly an army or state or church).  It is an illusion to think that <br>
there is such a thing as an "advanced being" which does not incorporate <br>
humans within it.  <br>
