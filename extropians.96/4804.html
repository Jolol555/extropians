<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;What if I see the behaviour I do not *agree* with?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;For example, the populace that votes for somebody who promised them no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;taxes and lots of free booze.  This may look like a good idea to every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;particular person, but politically it may be disastrous. ...</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;political decision-making process.  No wonder political structures</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in this country stink more than toilets.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The voting process oversimplifies the issues to create an illusion</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that everybody can understand international politics and economic and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;military strategies ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a direct example of my claim.  You see people vote for</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians you don't like, and you conclude it must be because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been fooled, that they are under an "illusion".  Maybe, to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; contrary, most voters are well aware of these various negative aspects</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our political systems.  Maybe the reason they don't all demand a</i><br>
<i>&gt; change is that they don't know of a better political system.</i><br>
<p>
WHich, if change were needed would be obvious evidence of stupidity. If<br>
they had any intelligence they would be demanding change with all sorts<br>
of bright ideas. People get the government they vote for. If its a<br>
screwed up government that cant pull its head out of its ass, that is<br>
representative of the same situation existing in the people who voted<br>
for that government. Of course, if nothing is being done, it is possible<br>
that the people are satisfied with how things are and don't want<br>
anything to be changed, which from a libertarian sense is almost as good<br>
as having no government at all.<br>
