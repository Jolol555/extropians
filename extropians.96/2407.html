<i>&gt;                    &gt;your thread of consciousness still remains in your brain. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To say that consciousness is in our brain is like saying speed is in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; particular racing car and if we just look close enough we'll find it lurking </i><br>
<i>&gt; someplace in the machinery, thus another car moving at the exact same </i><br>
<i>&gt; velocity  must nevertheless have a different speed because the same speed </i><br>
<i>&gt; can't be in two places at once. Obviously this doesn't work, I realize speed </i><br>
<i>&gt; is just a scalar and mind has a huge number of variables, but if it doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; work in the  simple case making it more complex won't help.  </i><br>
<p>
Speed is a property of a race car.  There can be many instances of a <br>
race car, each with its own speed.  <br>
Same thing applies to the brain.  Consciousness is a property of the <br>
brain.   There can be many instances of a single brain, each with its <br>
own consciousness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;All you are doing by uploading is spawning a second thread </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;of consciousness that thinks it is you.                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I don't really survive I just think I do? </i><br>
<p>
You wouldn't think at all.  If the upload was destructive, you would be <br>
dead.  Only the uploaded clone would think it was you.  You would <br>
cease to exist and all we would have is a computer that contains a <br>
specific instance of you.  *Your* instance would have been terminated <br>
by the upload.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The uploaded brain would have every reason to think it was                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;you because every memory tells it that it is you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, the upload would certainly believe that he was you, and I can find no  </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to think he would be wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  The upload is you, but it is a different instance of you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                       </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Your human brain (and consciousness) would walk away and                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;continue to evolve on its own thread. Your uploaded brain                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;would also continue to evolve, but on a separate thread of                </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                       </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, very soon the two would start to diverge because of random factors and </i><br>
<i>&gt; the fact that they would receive different input data from the environment, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but that doesn't change the fact that at the instant the second original was </i><br>
<i>&gt; made the two were identical. I should add that every day things happen to you </i><br>
<i>&gt; that make your consciousness evolve in a completely different direction than </i><br>
<i>&gt; it otherwise would, and this has nothing to do with copies.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by this. Information can be copied and information </i><br>
<i>&gt; can (probably) be destroyed by sending it through a non reversible computer </i><br>
<i>&gt; or dropping a floppy disk into a Black Hole. If information no longer exists </i><br>
<i>&gt; at point A but now exists at point B it sure sounds to me like it moved.    </i><br>
<p>
A lot of people seem to be tripping up on this.  This is an extremely <br>
common misperception.  It wasn't until I was studying information <br>
theory that I figured this thing out.  It's application to uploading <br>
didn't occur to me until a couple days ago.<br>
<p>
Information does not exist in the physical universe.  Information is <br>
only encoded on objects that exist in the physical universe.  For <br>
information to exist, it must be encoded on a substrate.  If every <br>
piece of substrate containing a specific piece of information is <br>
destroyed, the information is destroyed permanently. <br>
<p>
Because information does not exist physically, a physical translation <br>
in space of the substrate is irrelevant.  Moving information is to <br>
copy the encoded information from one substrate to another.  Physical <br>
proximity does not matter.<br>
<p>
What most people *really* mean when they say information has been <br>
moved is:<br>
1)  The substrate containing the information has been physically <br>
moved, or<br>
<p>
2)  a copy of the information was made on a different substrate, and <br>
the information on the originating substrate was destroyed after the <br>
copy was made.<br>
<p>
You can't move the information from Floppy Disk A to Floppy Disk B <br>
without making a copy.  It isn't possible.  <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;The problem with the human brain is that we are more or less                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;locked into the architecture that biology gave us. Even if                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;we replaced every neuron with optical switches, we would                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;still be limited by the architecture. It would be like                </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;running a '286 computer at 500MHz. Fast, but very limited. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The easiest way to do an upload is the paint by numbers approach, replace  </i><br>
<i>&gt; each neuron with something much smaller and faster. To do this you'd need to </i><br>
<i>&gt; have a good understanding about neurons operate but you wouldn't need to know </i><br>
<i>&gt; how the brain as a whole operates. As you point out this is very limiting, </i><br>
<i>&gt; a billion fold increase in speed and immortality is about all we could expect </i><br>
<i>&gt; from it. To design something better we'd need to understand how intelligence </i><br>
<i>&gt; operates, and that could be enormously difficult. It could take uploads  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 100,000 years of vigorous research to figure it out, that's about an hour </i><br>
<i>&gt; in our time. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Even if we were able to understand how <br>
intelligence operates,  is it possible to "reorganize" or extend the <br>
architechture of the brain without causing changes in consciousness?  <br>
It may be my own limitations, but I can't help but think that <br>
although our intelligence could be extended fairly easily, our <br>
consciousness is irremovably tied to the overall structure of our <br>
brain.<br>
