I've seen a remark that prokaryotes don't seem to have changed much in<br>
the past gigayear.  I don't know what backed up the comment, but it<br>

The nature of life is certainly to spread itself.  Whether that's the<br>
nature of intelligence depends on how you view the Great Silence.<br>
Arguably the capstone for this century's work -- Godel's Theorem,<br>
Turing's Halting Problem, possibly something else -- would be the<br>
discovery that intelligence ends up destroying itself[1].<br>

Okay, who here reads comp.risks or the RISKS mailing list?  Should<br>
probably be mandatory reading for extropians, just to see the other side<br>
of spontaneous systems, at least in technology.  Robust, hah.  Our<br>
personal robustness probably comes as much from having trillions of<br>
cells as from being self-repairing; it takes a long time for enough<br>
cells to croak to bring down the system.<br>

<p>
Predation isn't a threat to life either.  Just a threat to somebody's<br>
life.  Oddly enough, somebody tends to complain.  This would support<br>
your self-transformation argument, though.<br>
