          David Musick: <br>
          I have always liked the uncompromisingly objective way of <br>
          thinking and speaking: the more counterintuitive and <br>
          repugnant a formulation, the more it appeals to me given <br>
          that it is logically correct. Take for example the following <br>
          sentence:<br>
          <br>
                Blacks are more stupid than whites.<br>
          <br>
          I like that sentence and think it is true. But recently I <br>
          have begun to believe that I won't have much success with <br>
          most people if I speak like that. They would think that I <br>
          were a "racist": that I _disliked_ black people and thought <br>
          that it is fair if blacks are treated badly. I don't. It's <br>
          just that based on what I have read, I think it is probable <br>
          that black people have a lower average IQ than mankind in <br>
          general, and I think that IQ is highly correlated with what <br>
          we normally mean by "smart" and stupid". I may be wrong <br>
          about the facts, but that is what the sentence means for me. <br>
          For most people, however, the sentence seems to be <br>
          synonymous with:<br>
          <br>
                I hate those bloody niggers!!!!<br>
          <br>
          My point is that while speaking with the provocativness of <br>
          unabashed objectivity would be appreciated by me and many <br>
          other persons on this list, it may be a less effective <br>
          strategy in communicating with some of the people "out <br>
          there". I think it is laudable if you accustom people to the <br>
          offensiveness of truth, but be prepared that you may suffer <br>
          some personal damage.<br>
          <br>
