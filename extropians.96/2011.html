<p>
<p>
That's true, and hard work is also needed to generate wealth, but if I can't<br>
benefit from my labor there is no point in me working harder than the average<br>
man, I'd much rather just sit under a tree and read a book. Also, there is <br>
no point in me figuring out a way to do things any better than average, <br>
it's a waste of time to make an invention, because whatever the invention<br>
is it can have no practical benefit to me. As far as getting ahead in the<br>
world I might as well study Turkish love poems of the 14'th century for all<br>
the good it'll do me. You don't have to take my word for this, look at History,<br>
time after time we find dictators preaching, screaming, at his subjects,<br>
telling them to work hard, forget about themselves and do everything for the<br>
state. It never, ever, works.<br>
                   <br>

<i>                &gt;There is plenty in the pie for all. The problem in the world </i><br>
<i>                &gt;is not lack of wealth  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can't find the smallest particle of evidence to support that assumption.<br>
There is not one person in a thousand I would trade places with in the former<br>
Soviet Union, the same with India, the same for South America, much less than<br>
that for Africa. Since China started to embrace capitalism a little they've<br>
improved their standard of living dramatically, but even so, very few are as<br>
well off as the average American. Spread all that money around however you<br>
like, the average person on Earth will be dirt poor. We desperately need a<br>
bigger pie, and socialism sure as hell won't give it to us.<br>
<p>
Besides, when you talk about spreading wealth around, it only makes sense<br>
to speak of disposable wealth. Our new rulers could convert the large house of<br>
the owner of a steel mill into an apartment house for his friends, but that's<br>
just a tiny part of this rich man's wealth, the house is just a wealth<br>
absorber. By far, the major part of his wealth in the mill itself, and this<br>
is a wealth generator not an absorber, it makes steel and jobs. What are you<br>
going to do with this factory, tear it down and give everybody a piece of the<br>
rubble?<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;All the  resources that go into making a sonic toothbrush </i><br>
<i>                &gt;that is only cared for by people with money to burn </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Funny you should mention that, I've been thinking of buying a sonic <br>
toothbrush. Feel free to disapprove of me, I intent to do what I want anyway.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;We also have severe food waste problems here, like McDonalds </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Now just hold on a minute, that's going too far, some things are sacred! I'll<br>
pray to Saint Ronald and ask Him to forgive you.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                        &gt;some people have choices that suck more than others.   </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Yes, life is full of choices, some of them unpleasant. I hope I never have to <br>
make the choice between sending my 7 year old child to work in a factory or<br>
letting her starve to death, but if it ever came down to it, the decision <br>
would be easy, if sad.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Same thing in the soviet union. Created plenty of wealth, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;but wasted it in a system that was very bureaucractic and </i><br>
<i>                &gt;elitist.     </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
The Soviet Union built many of huge dams. They built them in the wrong place.<br>
The Soviet Union built the largest steel mills in the world. They built them<br>
at a time when the world did not need more steel. Both projects, and many,<br>
many, more turned into wealth absorbers not wealth generators, but that's<br>
what happens when politicians think they're smarter than the market. How<br>
could it be otherwise?<br>
                   <br>
 <br>
<i>                &gt;So you think Libertarism will minimize force? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There are no guarantees in life, but there is reason for optimism. It's easy <br>
to vote for some idiot politician who says he will stop your neighbor from <br>
sinning, it's much harder to shell out cold hard cash for it. For example, in <br>
this democracy many towns have laws against women wearing string bikinis on <br>
the beach, and it's simple to see why, there are plenty of prudes and it <br>
doesn't cost them anything to vote. Now let's consider this in a world of <br>
anarchy. The prude is considering 2 PPA's that are identical except for one <br>
thing, one has a decency patrol to harass women on the beach 20 miles from  <br>
his home, the other doesn't but uses the money  saved to send an extra  <br>
security patrol through his neighborhood at 3Am. The prude would have to be <br>
very prudish indeed to pick the first PPA. <br>
                                                                 <br>
                     <br>
<i>                &gt;If a person builds an energy efficient house without taking </i><br>
<i>                &gt;too much resources from everybody else, we'll be the first </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to applaud. We won't confiscate it </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
As time goes on your ideas are becoming less clear to me. If I'm a harder <br>
worker than you and a better architect than you,  then the house I build will<br>
be better than your house. If private property is not allowed then your claim<br>
to the great house I just built is every bit as strong as mine, if you have a<br>
bigger family than I do, then your claim is even stronger and you can take it<br>
from me, or at least you can try, but if you want me to abandon my new<br>
dwelling you're going to need some firepower. I don't think I'm unusual<br>
in that regard.<br>
<p>
The world you are describing is a fairy tale land, where everybody loves <br>
everybody, nobody is selfish, everybody works hard, everybody is equally<br>
talented, the correct decisions are always made, and most incredible of all,<br>
everybody is always in perfect agreement about what is fair and what is not.<br>
<p>
Ever notice that when somebody talks about what is fair, it always just<br>
happens to be to the personal advantage of the speaker. Quite a coincidence.<br>
I'll bet a baseball player has never in the history of the world complained<br>
to the umpire " You must be blind! It's not fair, I was clearly out at home<br>
base, yet you said I was safe and that we won the game, you're giving our team<br>
an unfair advantage. We should louse. Your call was grossly unfair you bum! ".<br>
<p>
                          <br>
<i>                &gt;if it's a great house, then we'll all pitch in and help </i><br>
<i>                &gt;everyone get a good house too. </i><br>
                          <br>
<p>
What's this "we" business. I  had to sweat blood building my house, and <br>
I'm not in the mood to build another one for you for free. Build your own <br>
damn house. <br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>            &gt;they'll get angry. Hell hath no fury like an anarcho-syndicalist </i><br>
<i>            &gt;commune  scorned.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That I believe. It's a pity the people of France didn't believe it after<br>
their revolution, or the people in the Soviet Union during The Terror in the<br>
1920's, or the people of Germany in the 1930's at the start of The Holocaust,<br>
or the people in China after the Cultural Revolution, or ...<br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;everybody, I guess, is a Thought Police, because when you </i><br>
<i>                &gt;screw us, we want to know.   </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Big Brother Is Watching You. War Is Peace. Freedom Is Slavery. Ignorance Is<br>
Strength.                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;It's just extended democracy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Democracy sucks. Extending it doesn't help.<br>
