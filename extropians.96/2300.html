I don't completely understand the distinction, unless it's in the idea<br>
that<br>
"somebody" must be an enemy. In the scenario I favor, the intent is to<br>
use<br>
the computing resources to augment the intelligence. The effect may be<br>
to<br>
deny the computing resources to others, or the SI may elect to stay<br>
covert by<br>
only using otherwise-unused resources.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This scenario occurs in Vinge's "True Names" as the result of a defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; against a perversion attack. One of my underlying assumptions is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the internet is vulnerable to such an attack, and that the first atacker</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will win. It isn't really a war at all. Further, the result may not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; negative.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, that depends on the possibility to self-augment using computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources. While computer security is full of holes everywhere, it isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; that bad - cracking into computers to get more computing power is</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-trivial and takes time, even for an SI. The idea that a sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; smart being could crack everything is a myth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
This depends strongly on how intelligent the SI becomes. Breaking into a<br>
system is reputed to require intelligence and persistence. Frequently, a<br>
clever idea can reduce the amount of brute-force computing needed to<br>
solve<br>
a security problem. If the "True Names" augmentation scenario is valid,<br>
then<br>
the SI will become progressively more capable of generating the<br>
appropriate<br>
clever ideas. Clearly the proper strategy is to start by acquiring the<br>
(nearly) undefended systems, then using them to augment the SI to let it<br>
acquire the slightly better-defended systems, and so forth. Many system<br>
are<br>
essentially undefended, because the perceived cost of a penetration is<br>
less than<br>
the system administrator's perceived cost of defending the system. As a<br>
quick reality check on this, when  did you last change your password? Is<br>
your<br>
new password a combination of your spouse's initials and digits from<br>
your<br>
telephone number? (A substantial percentage of passwords are.) Are your<br>
files read-protected against other users?  As you point out, computer<br>
security<br>
is full of holes (nearly) everywhere. As it happens, a fairly minor hole<br>
is all<br>
it takes to permit a major penetration to occur. I personally hope the<br>
SI is<br>
benign. I think that's the only hope for all other intelligences,<br>
including me.<br>
<p>
The only computers for which easy cracking is a myth are those with<br>
administrators<br>
who really care, or those that are not on the net. I believe that this<br>
comprises a<br>
small subset of the computers on the net.<br>
