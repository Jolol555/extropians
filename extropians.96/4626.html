Um, of course the "proof" floating around in Tipler's "The physics of <br>
immortality" is just an outline of a proof (because a formal derivation <br>
would go way beyond the scope of that book), but aren't the other ones <br>
supposed to be rigorous proofs? John, since your mathematical/physical <br>
capabilites are quite formidable, could you perhaps have a look at these <br>
proofs in the original literature, and tell us what you think?<br>
