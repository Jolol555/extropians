The first thing your VRML world needs is a programming language.<br>
What is it... and where can we find docs?<br>
(VRML?  That's the modeling language - will it do behaviors?)<br>
<p>
In the meantime, have you visited LambdaMOO?<br>
<a href="telnet://lambda.parc.xerox.com:8888">telnet://lambda.parc.xerox.com:8888</a><br>
There's a lot you can do in just text, although there's a large 'lag',<br>
primarily because the core DB and most of the commonly used 'parents' =<br>
classes were designed by inexperienced C programmers.<br>
<p>
My chief advice for anyone setting up a virtual world is to start off on<br>
the right foot; have someone experienced - say, me - do the basic<br>
architectures, the generic rooms and players and so on.  I wrote (for<br>
MOO) some very high-speed expandable basic room generics.  You might be<br>
able to adapt the architecture to VRML.  I also have an object-oriented<br>
non-procedural causal-chain high-speed expandable RPG architecture, but<br>
I'm not sure you'd need that.<br>
<p>
Again, the chief danger is being frozen into some slow hacked-up<br>
nonexpandable procedural system.  The LambdaMOO room system and player<br>
classes are bad; LambdaMOO RPG is beyond words.  Don't just write a<br>
minimal set of basic classes; do it right the first time and make SURE<br>
it's written by someone who lives and breathes object-oriented.<br>
