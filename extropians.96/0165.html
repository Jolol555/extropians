I'm already regretting having tossed in my two cents here, as I cannot afford<br>
the time to form anything like a professional opinion about the McVeigh case.<br>
 It will naturally be a matter of strong opinion and I respect that many here<br>
will have done more research into the matter than I.  Accordingly, please<br>
accept these closing comments from me *cum grano salis*.<br>

<p>
Legal structures addressing the handling and presentation of evidence are<br>
complex.  There's no way around this: Its a subject that *very* bright minds<br>
devote whole careers to.  *As a lawyer* I cannot hope to express an informed<br>
opinion about the evidence presented in a complex case in which I did not<br>
participate without *significant* research and analysis.  Thus, I'll keep my<br>
mouth shut.  Opinions from other perspectives certainly have value -- again,<br>
that's why we have public trials.<br>
<p>
But let me just offer one non-partisan "meta-value" that underlies much of<br>
the law of evidence.  Time and judicial resources are limited and disputes<br>
must be resolved within a *reasonable* amount of time.  Thus, there *have* to<br>
be at least some limits on the evidence that can be presented at a trial.<br>
 Believe me, if the parties to a case were allowed to say everything they<br>
could think of in support of their positions, nothing would ever get<br>
resolved.  Consider that "unrestricted access to all information" is<br>
problematic in this important respect, if for no other.<br>
