That would seem a most unlikely generalization, even if we didn't have<br>
evidence to the contrary.  As it happens, we *do* have evidence to the<br>
contrary, because on the &gt;H list we saw much support expressed for the<br>
notion that we were there, bouncing ideas off each other, as part of a<br>
personal search for understanding the world, and that through this<br>
wonderful exchange of ideas we were developing our personal worldviews<br>
or ideologies.  Perhaps a proportion of list members are content to go<br>
with an unmodified collective worldview, but in a &gt;H community of such<br>
strong individualists I rather doubt that it would be a high proportion.<br>
More likely we all accept the basic ideas of TH but tailor them to suit<br>
our very individual personal makeup.  That certainly expresses my own<br>
approach exactly.<br>
<p>
As for it all being *subjective*, you bet it is!!!<br>

Good for you!  Ever forward and onward!<br>

Yes indeed, hence the smiley.  All the best!<br>
