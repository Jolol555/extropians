 diametrally differing conclusions while investigating the same<br>
 set of facts. Bitrate's too low (he's somewhat loquacious),<br>
 furthermore there is imo some amount of muddled thinkin'.<br>

Abstract -- Our concepts of biology, evolution and complexity<br>
 are constrained by having observed only a single instance of<br>
 life, life on earth. A truly comparative biology is needed to<br>
 extend these concepts. Because we cannot observe life on other<br>
 planets, we are left with the alternative of creating Artificial<br>
 Life forms on earth. I will discuss the approach of inoculating<br>
 evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital<br>
 computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium; it is a<br>
 logical/informational medium. Thus, these new instances of<br>
 evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic<br>
 evolution (e.g. the laws of thermodynamics) and exist in what<br>
 amounts to another universe, governed by the "physical laws" of<br>
 the logic of the computer. This excercise gives us a broader<br>
 perspective on what evolution is and what it does.<br>
<p>
 An evolutionary approach to synthetic biology consists of<br>
 inoculating the process of evolution by natural selection into<br>
 an artificial medium. Evolution is then allowed to find the<br>
 natural forms of living organisms in the artificial medium.<br>
 These are not models of life, but independant instances of life.<br>
 This essay is intended to communicate a way of thinking about<br>
 synthetic biology that leads to a particular approach: to<br>
 understand and respect the natural form of the artificial<br>
 medium, to facilitate the process of evolution in generating<br>
 forms that are adapted to the medium, and to let evolution find<br>
 forms and processes that naturally exploit the possibilities<br>
 inherent to the medium. Examples are cited of synthetic biology<br>
 embedded in the computational medium, where in addition to being<br>
 an exercise in experimental comparative evolutionary biology, it<br>
 is also a possible means of harnessing the evolutionary process<br>
 for the production of complex computer software.<br>
<p>
1 Synthetic Biology<br>
<p>
Articial Life (AL) is the enterprise of understanding biology by<br>
constructing biological phenomena out of artificial components,<br>
rather than breaking natural life forms down into their<br>
component parts. It is the synthetic rather than the<br>
reductionist approach. I will describe an approach to the<br>
synthesis of artificial living forms that exhibit natural<br>
evolution.<br>
<p>
The umbrella of AI is broad and covers three principal<br>
approaches to synthesis: in hardware (e.g. robotics,<br>
nanotechnology), in software (e.g., replicating and evolving<br>
computer programs), and in wetware (e.g., replicating and<br>
evolving organic molecules, nucleic acids, or others). This<br>
essay will focus on software synthesis, although it is hoped<br>
that the issues discussed will be generalizable to any synthesis<br>
involving the process of evoluton.<br>
<p>
I would like to suggest that software syntheses in AL could be<br>
divided into two kinds: simulations and instantiations of life<br>
processes. AL simulations represent an advance in biological<br>
modeling, based on a bottom-up approach, which has been made<br>
possible by the increase of available computational power. In<br>
the older approaches to modeling of ecological or evolutionary<br>
phenomena, systems of differential equations were set up that<br>
expressed relationships between covarying quantities of entities<br>
(i.e., genes, alleles, individuals, or species) in the<br>
populations or communities.<br>
<p>
The new bottom-up approach creates a population of data<br>
structures, with each instance of the data structure<br>
corresponding to a single entity. These structures contain<br>
variables defining the state of an individual. Rules are defined<br>
as to how the individuals interact with one another and with the<br>
environment. As the simulation runs, populations of these data<br>
structures interact according to local rules, and the global<br>
behaviour of the system emerges from these interactions. Several<br>
very good examples of bottom-up ecological models have appeared<br>
in the AL literature [33,91]. However, ecologists have also<br>
developed this same approach independently of the AL movement<br>
and have called the approach "individual-based" models [19,39].<br>
<p>
The second approach to software synthesis is what I have called<br>
instantiation rather than simulation. In simulation, data<br>
structures are created that contain variables that represent the<br>
states of the entities being modeled. The important point is<br>
that in simulation, the data in the computer is treated as a<br>
representation of something else, such as a population of<br>
mosquitoes or trees. In instantiation, the data in the computer<br>
does not represent anything else. The data patterns in an<br>
instantiation are considered to be living forms in their own<br>
right and are not models of any natural life form. These can<br>
form the basis of a comparative biology [57].<br>
<p>
The object of an AL instantiation is to introduce the natural<br>
form and process of life into an artificial medium. This results<br>
in an AL form in some medium other than carbon chemistry and is<br>
not a model of organic life forms. The approach discussed in<br>
this essay involves introducing the process of evolution by<br>
natural selection into the computatonal medium. I consider<br>
evolution to be the fundamental process of life and the<br>
generator of living form.<br>
<p>
2 Recognizing Life<br>
<p>
Most approaches to defining life involve assembling a short set<br>
of properties of life and then testing candidates on the basis<br>
of whether or not they exhibit the properties on the list. The<br>
main problem with this approach is that there is disagreement as<br>
to what should be on the list. My private list contains only two<br>
items: self-replication and open-ended evolution. However, this<br>
reflects my biases as an evolutionary biologist.<br>
<p>
I prefer to avoid the semantic argument and take a different<br>
approach to the problem of recognizing life. I was led to this<br>
view by contemplating how I would regard a machine that<br>
exhibited conscious intelligence at such a level that it could<br>
participate as an equal in a debate like this. The machine would<br>
meet neither of my two main criteria as to what life is, yet I<br>
don't feel that I could deny that the process it contained was<br>
alive.<br>
<p>
This means that there are certain properties that I consider to<br>
be unique to life and whose presence in a system signify the<br>
existance of life in that system. This suggests an alternative<br>
approach to the problem. Rather than create a short list of<br>
minimal requirements and test whether a system exhibits all<br>
items on the list, one could create a long list of properties<br>
unique to life and test whether a system exhibits _any_ item on<br>
the list.<br>
<p>
To this softer, more pluralistic approach to recognizing life,<br>
the objective is not to determine if the system is alive or not<br>
but to determine if the system exhibits a "genuine" instance of<br>
some property that is a signature of living systems (e.g.,<br>
self-replication, evolution, flocking, consciousness).<br>
<p>
Whether we consider a system living because it exhibits some<br>
property that is unique to life amounts to a semantic issue.<br>
What is more important is that we recognize that it is possible<br>
to create disembodied but genuine instances of specific<br>
properties of life in artificial systems. This capability is a<br>
powerful research tool. By separating the property of life that<br>
we choose to study from the many other complexities of natural<br>
living systems, we make it easier to manipulate and observe the<br>
property of interest. The objective of the approach advocated in<br>
this paper is to capture genuine evolution in an artificial<br>
system.<br>
<p>
3 What Natural Evolution Does<br>
<p>
Evolution by natural selection is a process that enters into a<br>
physical medium. Through iterated replication with selection of<br>
large populations through many generations, it searches out the<br>
possibilities inherent in the "physics and chemistry" of the<br>
medium in which it is embedded. It exploits any inherent<br>
self-organizing properties of the medium in which it is<br>
embedded. It exploits any inherent self-organization of the<br>
medium and flows into natural attractors realizing and fleshing<br>
out their structure.<br>
<p>
Evolution never escapes from its ultimative imperative:<br>
self-replication.  However, the mechanisms that evolution<br>
discovers for achieving this ultimative goal gradually become so<br>
convoluted and complex that the underlying drive can seem to<br>
become superfluous. Some philosophers have argued that the<br>
evolutionary theory as expressed by the phrase "survival of the<br>
fittest" is tautological, in that the fittest are defined as<br>
those that survive to reproduce. In fact, fitness is achieved<br>
through innovation in engineering of the organism [81]. However,<br>
there remains something peculiarly self-referential about the<br>
whole enterprise. There is some sense in which life may be a<br>
natural tautology.<br>
<p>
Evolution is both a defining characteristic and the creative<br>
process of life itself. The living condition is a state that<br>
complex physical systems naturally flow into under certain<br>
conditions. It is a self-organizing, self-perpetuating state of<br>
autocatalytically increasing complexity. The living component of<br>
the physical system quickly becomes the most complex part of the<br>
system, such that it reshapes the medium in its own image. Life<br>
then evolves adaptations predominantly in relation to the living<br>
components of the system, rather than the nonliving components.<br>
Life evolves adaptations to itself.<br>
<p>
3.1 Evolution in Sequence Space<br>
<p>
Think of organisms as occupying a "genotype space" consisting of<br>
all possible lengths of the elements of genetic system (i.e.,<br>
nucleotids or machine instructions). When the first organism<br>
begins replicating, a single self-replicating creature, with a<br>
single sequence of certain length, occupies a single point in<br>
the genotype space. However, as the creature replicates in the<br>
environment, a population of creatures forms, and errors cause<br>
genetic variation, such that the population will form a cloud of<br>
points in the genotypes centered around the original point.<br>
<p>
Because the new prototypes that form the cloud are formed by<br>
random processes, most of them are completely inviable and die<br>
without reproducing. However, some of them are capable of<br>
reproduction. These new genotypes persist, and, because some of<br>
them are affected by mutation, the cloud of points spreads<br>
further. However, not all of the viable genomes are equally<br>
viable. Some of them discover tricks to replicate more<br>
efficiently. These genotypes increase in frequency, causing the<br>
population of the creatures at the corresponding points of the<br>
genotype space to increase.<br>
<p>
Points in the genotype space occupied by greater populations of<br>
individuals will spawn larger number of mutant offspring; thus<br>
the density of the cloud of points in the genotype space will<br>
shift gradually in the direction of the more fit genotypes. Over<br>
time, the cloud of points will percolate through the genotype<br>
space, either expanding outward as a result of random drift or<br>
by flowing along fitness gradients.<br>
<p>
Most of the volume of this space represents completely inviable<br>
sequences. These regions of the space may be momentarily and<br>
sparsely occupied by inviable mutants, but the cloud will never<br>
flow into the inviable regions. The cloud of genotypes may<br>
bifurcate as it flows into habitable regions in different<br>
directions, and it may split as large genetic changes spawn<br>
genotypes in distant but viable regions of the space. We may<br>
imagine that the evolving population of creatures will take the<br>
form of wispy clouds flowing through this space.<br>
<p>
Now imagine for a moment the situation that there was no<br>
selection. This implies that every sequence is replicated at an<br>
equal rate. Mutation will cause the cloud of points to expand<br>
outward, eventually filling the space uniformly. In this<br>
situation, the complexity of the structure of the cloud of<br>
points does not increase through time, only the volume that it<br>
occupies. Under selection by contrast, through time the cloud<br>
will take on an intrinsicate structure as it flows along fitness<br>
gradients and percolates by drift through narrow regions of<br>
viability in a largely uninhabitable space.<br>
<p>
Consider that the viable region of the genotype space is a very<br>
small subset of the total volume of the space, but that it<br>
probably exhibits a very complex shape, forming tendrils and<br>
sheets sparsely permeating an otherwise empty space. The complex<br>
structure of this cloud can be considered to be a product of<br>
evolution by natural selection. This thought experiment appears<br>
to imply that the intricate structure that the cloud of<br>
genotypes may assume through evolution is fully deterministic.<br>
Its shape is predefined by the physics and chemistry and the<br>
structure of the environment, in much the same way that the form<br>
of the Mandelbrot set is predetermined by its defining equation.<br>
The complex structure of this viable space is inherent in the<br>
medium and is an example of "order for free" [44].<br>
<p>
No living world will ever fill the entire viable subspace,<br>
either at a single moment of time, or even cumulatively over its<br>
entire history. The region actually filled will be strongly<br>
influenced by the original self-replicating sequence and by<br>
stochastic forces that will by chance push the cloud down a<br>
subset of possible habitable pathways. Furthermore, coevolution<br>
and ecological interactions imply that certain regions can only<br>
be occupied when certain other regions are also occupied. This<br>
concept of the flow of genotypes through the genotype space is<br>
essentially the same as that discussed by Eigen [22] in the<br>
context of "quasispecies". Eigen limited his discussion to<br>
species of viruses, where it is also easy to think of sequence<br>
spaces. Here, I am extending the concept beyond the bounds of<br>
the species to include entire phylogenies of species.<br>
<p>
3.2 Natural Evolution in an Artifical Medium<br>
<p>
Until recently, life has been known as a state of matter,<br>
particularly combinations of the elements carbon, hydrogen,<br>
oxygen, nitrogen, and smaller quantities of many others.<br>
However, recent work in the field of AL has shown that the<br>
natural evolutionary process can proceed with great efficacy in<br>
other media, such as the informational medium of the digital<br>
computer [1,3,5,15,16,20,24,42,43,50,52,53,67,68,70-73,76,77,<br>
80,88,90,96]. \footnote{In ref. I, Adami has used the<br>
input-output facilities of the new Tierra languages to feed data<br>
to creatures, and select for responses that result from single<br>
computations, not contained in the seed genome. In ref. 7,<br>
Brooks has created his own Tierra-like system, which he calls<br>
Sierra. In his implementation, each machine instruction consists<br>
of an opcode and an operand. Succesive instructions overlap such<br>
that the operand of one instruction is interpreted as the opcode<br>
of the next instruction. In ref. 88, "Tierra-like systems are<br>
being explored for their potential applications in solving the<br>
problem of predicting the dynamics of consumption of a single<br>
energy carrying resource."}<br>
<p>
These new natural evolutions in artificial media are beginning<br>
to explore the possibilities inherent in the "physics and<br>
chemistry" of those media. They are organizing themselves and<br>
constructing self-generating complex systems. While these new<br>
living systems are still so young that they remain in their<br>
primordial state, it appears that they have embarked on the same<br>
kind of journey taken by life on earth and presumably have the<br>
potential to evolve into levels of complexity that could lead to<br>
sentient and eventually intelligent beings.<br>
<p>
If natural evolution in artifical media leads to sentient or<br>
intelligent beings, they will likely be so alien that they will<br>
be difficult to recognize. The sentient properties of plants are<br>
so radically different from those of animals hat they are<br>
generally unrecognized or denied by humans, and plants are<br>
merely in another kingdom of the one great tree of organic life<br>
on earth [69,74,87]. Synthetic organisms evolving in other<br>
media, such as the digital computer, are not only not a part of<br>
the same philogeny, but they are not even of the same physics.<br>
Organic life is based on conventional materal physics, whereas<br>
digital life exists in a logical, not material, informational<br>
universe. Digital intelligence will likely be vastly different<br>
from human intelligence, forget the Turing test.<br>
