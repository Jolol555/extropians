I don't care for Microsoft's products, and in general I don't use them, but<br>
I don't feel that Microsoft's domination of the software market is at all<br>
to my detriment. Microsoft's domination simply means that all of<br>
Microsoft's competitors have to produce products that are better than<br>
Microsoft's if they expect to keep a piece of the market. This doesn't hurt<br>
me at all.<br>

I doubt that useful computer simulations of society will be available until<br>
sometime after we are able to produce useful computer simulations of human<br>
brains. Human brains are not only far more complex than anything we've ever<br>
been able to usefully simulate, but they also have a tremendous causal<br>
impact on the development of society.  ;)<br>
<p>
The question of the optimal social structure is explorable primarily by the<br>
study of history, a fact that futurist technophiles are often prone to<br>
overlook.<br>
<p>
As for your assertion about MONOPOLIES and OLIGOPOLIES, if you study the<br>
monopolies that one finds in history, they were generally either a result<br>
of government prohibition against their competitors or else were harmless<br>
and temporary, like the brief Alcoa monopoly on aluminum production earlier<br>
this century.<br>
