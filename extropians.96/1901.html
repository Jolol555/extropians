A good example of anarcho-capitalism, but one possible problem with the MOMM<br>
system is that the MOMM companies might attract the same kind of people that<br>
are currently attracted to government. What if the MOMMs decide that the<br>
people who currently don't want their services don't know what is good for<br>
themselves? The result would be the same thing we have now only with a<br>
different name. <br>
<p>
Even if the MOMMs degenerated like this, some good could result from<br>
implementing this system; the elimination of the 'we need government for<br>
such-and-such' meme might result in people questioning other forms of<br>
institutionalized coercion.<br>
