For the same reason I would be a bit perturbed at someone selling<br>
tickets to his mother's funeral. Tickets to his own funeral is another<br>
matter, especially if he is still around to enjoy it. I have since the<br>
movie came out learned that Spielberg put the profits to use in<br>
educational projects on the Holocaust, and am somewhat mollified. The<br>
fact that he did this indicates he shares my own revulsion from<br>
profiting on the dead.<br>
Seeing the article in today's paper on a study by a gentleman at<br>
Cambridge on Jews who served in the 3rd Reisch as high ranking officers<br>
while their families were being exterminated was a rather disturbing<br>
reflection on today's "don't ask, don't tell" policies towards gays in<br>
our own military. That Hitler and Goering were hypocrites enough to<br>
grant honorary "Aryan" status to Jews who were able to sufficiently deny<br>
their heritage and display physical Aryan traits (and were vital to the<br>
warfighting capability of the Duetchland), or even ignore the well known<br>
jewishness of some of their best officers in favor of tactical expertise<br>
makes their treatment of these individuals relatives that much more<br>
horrific.<br>
Since we as transhumans are seeking to attain the next level of human<br>
evolution, we run serious risks in having our ideas and programs branded<br>
by the popular media as neo-eugenics, racist, neo-nazi, etc., especially<br>
as it seems more and more likely that there will be serious disparities<br>
of opportunity for individuals to take advantage of the promise of<br>
upcoming technologies in attaining such breakthroughs in personal<br>
development. We must be militant in working toward making the technology<br>
available to as many individuals who are capable of comprehending it. TO<br>
say that it can't be helped is a lazy attitude to take, and<br>
representative of the type of intellectual laziness that led to a<br>
culmination of antisemitic policies such as the Final Solution. If the<br>
individuals who first attain "godhood" are so indifferent or even<br>
hostile toward their brothers and sisters who have not yet ascended, we<br>
would wind up as advocates not of the next step, but of the final<br>
mistake. It is this innate fear that many people have toward the future<br>
reality that manifests itself in the neo-luddism of today. Fearing that<br>
they will be left out or even become the repressed of tomorrow, they<br>
seek to prevent such events from transpiring or technologies from<br>
evolving.<br>
For this reason, we must be adamant about inclusivness, that the<br>
transhuman future is for all humans, not just for the elite that will<br>
develop the tools of attaining it. We must also as a group be decisively<br>
aware of this lesson from the past. Remember, the Nazi party was fouded<br>
by misfits, outcasts, and intellectuals, just the type to be subscribers<br>
to this list.<br>
