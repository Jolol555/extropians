<i>&gt; Why?  Do you have better alternatives?  Better than. . . Capitalism?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What's wrong with consumer choice and the voice of the people?</i><br>
<p>
That's not "the voice of the people". That translates into a dollar a <br>
vote. The people with the money get the ability to influence the lives of <br>
everybody else. So I guess it's the "voice of the people who count"<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; how does "maximal social outcomes" coincide with high poverty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  homelessness, a stuffed-to-overflowing penal system, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you talking about the USSR and China?  They are the lowest standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; living I can think of in industrialized countries.  They have high poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt; and overflowing prisons.  The "homeless" in the US have the highest standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; of living than in "homeless"any other county.  Even Jesus said the poor, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; will always be with us.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, great, and The Words of God(tm), are a good basis for dealing with <br>
society. Why should we accept poverty? If we are talkking about such <br>
grandiose things as uploading, Dyson Spheres and immortality, why can't <br>
we discuss utopias for all. It shouldn't be beyond humanity's grasp. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Dale Carnegie said a place where "...rich and poor are both free</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to sleep under bridges".&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dale Carnegie?  Mr. _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.  You are free</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be rich or poor, it is up to you.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &lt;&lt;some people don't win in a market economy&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not a meaningful statement.  Some people are lazy, stupid or</i><br>
<i>&gt; pessimistic too.    Tell me of a situation were most people win: Anytime you</i><br>
<p>
Some people are victims of geography, some people are born handicapped. <br>
Does that mean they should be ground up by the wheels of the capitalist <br>
machine? Libertarianism would work if everybody could compete on fair <br>
terms, but they can't, so some are going to lose all the time.<br>
 <br>
What is considered a fair advantage and what is considered unfair? <br>
<p>
When we get genetic engineering, will genetic flaws be considered an <br>
unfair advantage?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;Banjo&gt;&gt; i don't understand.  are you saying that someone who "suffers</i><br>
<i>&gt; material</i><br>
<i>&gt;  privation" (aka Poverty), deserves it.  Is the market equivalent of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  an outcaste or hermit ??&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If a business is not compelled to serve the consumer,  the consumer will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and should not) buy from that business again.  That business DOES deserve</i><br>
<i>&gt; not getting business again.  Call this an "outcaste" or "hermit" business.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But you don't have much of a business then do you.  You have killed your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; business.  This was not an initiation of harm except self-inflicted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Businesses can thrive quite well even if they don't serve the consumers. <br>
they can subsist solely on the desires of the wealthy. If you make <br>
something only the people who can afford it want, then that's all that <br>
matters. Anyone else isn't in the "market demographics"<br>
