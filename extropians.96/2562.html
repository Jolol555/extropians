<i>&gt; Suppose an exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, </i><br>
<i>&gt; were made a billion light years away. The duplicate world </i><br>
<i>&gt; would need some sort of feedback mechanism to keep the worlds </i><br>
<i>&gt; in synchronization, non linear effects would amplify tiny variations, </i><br>
<i>&gt; even quantum fluctuations, into big differences, but this is just a </i><br>
<i>&gt; thought experiment so who cares. In the first two cases below the results </i><br>
<i>&gt; would vary according to personalities, remember there's a lot of illogic </i><br>
<i>&gt; even in the best of us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads </i><br>
<i>&gt;    and we are both convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, </i><br>
<i>&gt;    making a hell of a mess, but the other gun for inexplicable reasons </i><br>
<i>&gt;    misfires. In this case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying </i><br>
<i>&gt;    experience I am completely unharmed.         </i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
Very interesting experiment.  After much consideration, I look at it <br>
this way:<br>
<p>
After one duplicate was killed, from your viewpoint, no one would <br>
have died.  <br>
<i>&gt;From the viewpoint of some observers, however,  you did die.</i><br>
I guess this would mean that the consciousness of the observers would <br>
no longer be synchronized between the two worlds, since you are dead <br>
and not dead at the same time to the observers, depending on who you <br>
ask.<br>
