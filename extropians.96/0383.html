Since I wear my cryonics bracelet with pride, and it's part of the way I<br>
live, it will tend to show up in photos and on TV. I doubt readers of Muscle<br>
and Fitness will have a clue that it's a cryonics bracelet. I sent then that<br>
picture because I thought it appropriate. The cryonics bracelet showing is a<br>
nice touch and a natural result of my being open about being a head-freezer,<br>
but I can't say I set out to deliberately create a photo with the bracelet<br>
showing for that purpose.<br>
<p>
I've noticed that some cryonicists hide their bracelets or necklaces, or<br>
cover them up in certain company. I find that understandable in certain<br>
situations, although I've never felt that need. In general it's good to let<br>
it all hang out, since it can spark questions that allow you to get people<br>
thinking. No one's ever punched me or screamed at me for explaining the<br>
bracelet, so I don't think it's too dangerous. :-)<br>
