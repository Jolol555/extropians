IAN: I'm not sure exactly how this ties in but, having fairly <br>
extensive lucid dream experience -- where, while asleep you <br>
"wake up" in your dream to realize, "Like woh, I'm dreaming, gee,<br>
this is cool" -- up to the point of willful lucid state induction, <br>
I've observed the amazing phenomenon that one can, in the sleeping <br>
dream state, have a set of memories that even upon careful review <br>
appear to be 100% accurate and true to your non asleep life, yet <br>
upon waking are seen to in fact have been 100% false.<br>
<p>
In short: the mind is able to instantly fabricate a rich and <br>
complex field of memories that are totally false, yet cannot<br>
be detected by the observer whose apparatus of detection is <br>
irrevocably tied to that fabricating brain. <br>
<p>
In one lucid dream, I was in a room and decided to inspect as <br>
much of the dream, its structure and nature, as possible. Looking <br>
out through the sliding glass door on to a sun drenched backyard <br>
with swing set, I recalled my childhood growing up there. I "saw" <br>
and "felt" in my memory years of existence there, irrevocably <br>
interwoven with "who I am." However, upon waking up, I saw that it <br>
was false, that it had no correlation with Ian's life or childhood. <br>
<p>
Never the less, while I was "awake" in the dream, giving it my <br>
best critical examination -- what is this object made of, look <br>
at that TV, let's inspect its physical caricaturists, I'll write <br>
something down on this dreamland pad of paper, hay, the letters <br>
I just wrote are changing before my eyes -- knowing what I was <br>
seeing was a dream, and thus was a false world, I was still 100% <br>
duped into falling for the reality of a false set of memories due <br>
to the fact that I had and  WAS a mind full of fabricated memories<br>
(in a way, an illusion cannot detect itself to be an illusion). The <br>
"truth" of the memories was as "true" as can be. I even thought at <br>
the time, "Clearly, while I'm in a dream, a false world, and some <br>
features, such as the changing letters I just wrote, prove <br>
it is a dream, the memories of my life are accurate." <br>
But they were not.<br>
<p>
Some might speculate that I was having a "past life memory." I can't<br>
disprove that claim. I can only say it seems equally plausible that,<br>
just as the mind can instantly fabricate a "physical universe" in the <br>
dream state, that appears amazing real, it can also fabricate a mind <br>
connected to that universe with false memories just as easily.<br>
<p>
Of course, logically, this must draw into question the <br>
reality of any mental phenomena, opennng the door to the <br>
ideation that everyting is a dream, or less to 100% true.<br>
