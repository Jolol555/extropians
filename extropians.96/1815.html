You are quite correct. Drexler mentions disassemblers in<br>
this regard as you cite:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/EOC_Chapter_1.html#section09of10">http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/EOC_Chapter_1.html#section09of10</a><br>
<p>
My impression, however, in reading this section is that this<br>
disassembly will be a later phase of the nanotech revolution,<br>
as seen by Drexler in the early 80's. I'm willing to concede<br>
the possibility of just about any technology not prohibited<br>
by the laws of physics, if we wait until after the singularity.<br>
In EoC, Drexler uses the "disassembler" to describe the<br>
scanner/analyzer function, and also to describe a simpler<br>
functions of reducing a solid object to feedstock.<br>
<p>
So, what I should have said is that my arguments in favor of a<br>
nanotech revolution do not depend on the concept of atom-by-atom<br>
scanning. I believe that it will be fairly straightforward to<br>
produce nano-buildable versions of existing designs for most<br>
goods that exist today. More specifically, I feel that the<br>
goods required for a "fairly lavish lifestyle" comprise a<br>
small subset of all goods produced today, and that these<br>
goods will ba nano-buildable. This includes houses, cars<br>
or equivalents, fuel, generators, and many food items.<br>
Nanotech could also build electronic goods from esisting<br>
designs, but probably will not. Digital electronics, at least,<br>
is generally designed initially at the logic level, and<br>
we can re-implement the logic using nanotech rod-logic or<br>
nanotech electronic logic.<br>
<p>
Nearly all macro-designed items (such as a house) can<br>
be improved upon using techniques available only with<br>
nanotech assembly, but such improvements are not necessary<br>
to provide a consumer with today's lavish lifestyle. I<br>
suspect that the improvements would be forthcoming in the<br>
form of designs created by consumers for their own amusement<br>
and distributed for the fun of it in the manner that<br>
recipes and hobby project plans are distributed today.<br>
