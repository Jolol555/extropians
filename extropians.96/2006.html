I am also of Native American heritage.  The sentence did NOT "stick in my<br>
craw".  <br>
<p>
My ancestors acted like "Native American" socialists, I guess.  They acted<br>
communally and hunted for the group, finally settling down and farming for<br>
the group.  Not exactly (;-) capitalists.  They took land by force all the<br>
time (right up to the middle 1970's).  Some of them now days are capitalists<br>
and some are still socialists.  I can give examples if you want:  The<br>
socialists "feel sorry" for me because I do not accept government<br>
entitlements.  It's a long story but I am not exactly (;-) attracting them as<br>
friends these days.  They want me to "fight" for more government money.<br>
<p>
The capitalists among us (who I am and others who I admire)  are starting<br>
businesses and supporting ourselves.  We don't like what they see as<br>
government "hand-outs".  <br>
