<i>&gt; I was also considering how robust life in general is on </i><br>
<i>&gt; this planet and how it would pretty much take the sun going nova to</i><br>
destroy it <br>
<i>&gt; all.  </i><br>
<p>
It's funny that when i read thru a lot of Sci-fi it seem that we<br>
desperately need to get out of the gravity well and into giant o'neill<br>
space station or the like.<br>
A planet is actually on of the greatest spacetation that i can imagine.<br>
It's extremely stable in  shape and size and the atmosphere doesn't fizz<br>
out when punctured by a meteorite.<br>
<p>
Well that said i would shure like to try out one of them O'neill dingies :)<br>
Just don't write of planets just yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is </i><br>
<i>&gt; there a level of advancement beyond which highly intelligent life is </i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible to destroy?  Right now, we are vulnerable.  Can we ever move</i><br>
beyond <br>
<i>&gt; that?  Is such a state of invincibility even possible?</i><br>
<p>
Well if i were a uploaded transhuman that had lived for Billion of years<br>
and seen it all and was starting to get bored with life. Then i would<br>
download my conciousnes into the structure of the universe. Well maybe i<br>
would settle for a galaxy. Then i would slow down my speed so i was no<br>
longer a strong nor a weak superhuman but a very slooow "supergalaxy". Then<br>
i would spend my last "day" watching the universe/me die in glorious time<br>
lapse.<br>
<p>
Wouldn't that be a cool way to go?<br>
<p>
Maybe other sentient beings in the universe have done that. and thats why<br>
we will never se extraterrestial life.<br>
