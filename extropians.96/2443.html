<p>
I agree, preserving my phenotype is not good enough because a few things have<br>
happened to me since the day I was born and I want all that to be preserved<br>
too.             <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;Oh dear oh dear.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In my opinion that part of Tipler's theory is self evidently true, the<br>
uncertain part for me is if the laws of Physics are such that they allow the<br>
universe to make an infinite, and not just an astronomically large, number of<br>
calculations in a finite amount of time. If the Universe can do that then<br>
everything else will follow naturally, or at least I think so, and to tell<br>
the truth it's a lot more than 100 billion years, resurrection according to<br>
Tipler will happen in 2 * 10^18 years, give or take a few hundred trillion.<br>
I don't see why the length of time is important however, if I'm dead it would <br>
all seem instantaneous to me anyway.<br>
<p>
Time will tell if Tipler is absurd or not, but I definitely don't think it's<br>
sophistry because he can in principle be proven false. He makes a bunch of<br>
predictions that we should be able to test for in the next 4 or 5 years.<br>
Tipler himself states that every one of these predictions must turn out to be<br>
correct or the entire theory is dead in the water.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that the universe is closed: I think most would say it's<br>
  probably open, Tipler say's they're wrong. We'll see.<br>
<p>
* Tipler wrote his book in early 1992 and predicted that the mass of the<br>
  Top Quark would be 185 + - 20 GeV: At the time there was a report that it<br>
  was at 135 GeV, Tipler said this must be in error and it turned out he was<br>
  right. In March 1995 Fermi Lab found the Top Quark at 180 + - 13 GeV.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that the Higgs boson must be at 220 + - 20 GeV: If he's<br>
  correct then when the CERN Large Hadron Collider goes on line in 1999 it<br>
  will find it almost immediately.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background<br>
  black body radiation must be less than 6 * 10^-5: This prediction looks<br>
  good, the observed value is around 5 * 10^-6.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that the Hubble constant must be less than or equal to 45:<br>
  30 years ago most thought it was about 200, a year ago most thought it was<br>
  85, today people are talking about 55.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that at maximum extent just before it starts to contract<br>
  the universe must be 70^3 times larger than it is now or larger: This<br>
  depends on the density of the universe so we'll have to clear up all the<br>
  confusion over "Dark Matter" before we can tell how well he's doing on this<br>
  one.<br>
<p>
Tipler makes some other predictions that he doesn't know how to test for, but<br>
there is no reason to think that it would be impossible for anyone to figure<br>
out a way.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that the contraction of the universe will not be symmetrical.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that the entire universe is a past light cone: This means<br>
  that if you send out a beam of light eventually it will circle the entire<br>
  universe and come back and hit you in the back of the head, the time it<br>
  takes to this depends on the size of the universe. Tipler says light will<br>
  be able to make an infinite number of such trips before the universe<br>
  collapses into a singularity.<br>
<p>
* Tipler predicts that both density and energy will diverge to infinity<br>
  during the big crunch, but the density must not diverge faster than the<br>
  cube of the energy.<br>
