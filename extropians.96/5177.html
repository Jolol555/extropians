           'Shell Game' Attempts to Continue Unconstitutional Rules<br>
          SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Laywers for Professor Dan<br>
Bernstein<br>
today asked the Government to delay enforcement of new encryption<br>
restrictions<br>
until they can be reviewed by a court for Constitutionality.  The new<br>
regulations contain the same features struck down earlier this month by Judge<br>
Marilyn Hall Patel.<br>
          "The government apparently decided to ignore Judge Patel's<br>
findings," said<br>
Cindy Cohn, lead attorney in the case.  "Instead of listening to Judge<br>
Patel's<br>
analysis and attempting to fix the regulations, they simply issued new ones<br>
with the same problems.  We are giving them a chance to fix this before we<br>
bring the issue up in court."<br>
          President Clinton ordered on November 15 that the regulations be<br>
moved<br>
from the State Department to the Commerce Department.  Judge Patel's decision<br>
of December 6 (released December 16th) struck down the State Department<br>
regulations as a "paradigm of standardless discretion" that required<br>
Americans<br>
to get licenses from the government to publish information and software about<br>
encryption.  Over Christmas, the Clinton Administration published its new<br>
Commerce Department regulations, containing all the same problems, and put<br>
them into immediate effect today.<br>
          The new regulations once again put Professor Bernstein at risk of<br>
prosecution for teaching a class on encryption and publishing his class<br>
materials on the Internet.  His class begins on January 13 at the University<br>
of Illinois at Chicago.<br>
          Professor Bernstein's letter of today proposes that the Government<br>
agree<br>
to delay enforcement of the new regulations while Judge Patel reviews them<br>
for<br>
Constitutionality.  Failing that, Professor Bernstein will ask the court for<br>
a<br>
temporary restraining order to block their enforcement.<br>
          "The government is forcing us to go back to Judge Patel again to<br>
have the<br>
new regulations declared facially unconstitutional," said Ms. Cohn.  "This<br>
time we believe that a nationwide injunction against their enforcement is<br>
merited."<br>
          "The new encryption rules are a pointless shell game," said John<br>
Gilmore,<br>
co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which backed the suit.<br>
"Industry and Congress had asked that the draconian State Department<br>
regulations be eliminated in favor of existing, reasonable, Commerce<br>
Department regulations.  Judge Patel invalidated the State Department<br>
regulations because they were draconian.  Rather than address the concerns of<br>
either, President Clinton moved the draconian regulations into the Commerce<br>
Department -- and made them tougher in the process.  Its his political<br>
decision whether to ignore and anger industry leaders, but he can't ignore a<br>
federal district court judge."<br>
          Civil libertarians have long argued that encryption should be<br>
widely<br>
deployed on the Internet and throughout society to protect privacy, prove the<br>
authenticity of transactions, and improve computer security.  Industry has<br>
argued that the restrictions hobble them in building secure products, both<br>
for<br>
U.S. and worldwide use, risking America's current dominant position in<br>
computer and communications technology.  Government officials in the FBI and<br>
NSA argue that the technology is too dangerous to permit citizens to use it,<br>
because it provides privacy to criminals as well as ordinary citizens.<br>
          Background on the case<br>
    The plaintiff in the case, Daniel J. Bernstein, Research Assistant<br>
Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, developed an "encryption<br>
algorithm" (a recipe or set of instructions) that he wanted to publish in<br>
printed journals as well as on the Internet.  Bernstein sued the government,<br>
claiming that the government's requirements that he register as an arms<br>
dealer<br>
and seek government permission before publication was a violation of his<br>
First<br>
Amendment right of free speech.  This was required by the Arms Export Control<br>
Act and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms<br>
Regulations.  The new regulations have the same effect, using the<br>
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Export Administration<br>
Regulations, and a "state of national emergency" that President Clinton<br>
declared in 1994 and has re-declared annually.<br>
          In the first phase of this litigation, the government argued that<br>
since<br>
Bernstein's ideas were expressed, in part, in computer language (source<br>
code),<br>
they were not protected by the First Amendment.  On April 15, 1996, Judge<br>
Patel rejected that argument and held for the first time that computer source<br>
code is protected speech for purposes of the First Amendment.<br>
          On December 6, Judge Patel ruled that the Arms Export Control Act<br>
is a<br>
prior restraint on speech, because it requires Bernstein to apply for and<br>
obtain from the government a license to publish his ideas.  Using the<br>
Pentagon<br>
Papers case as precedent, she ruled that the government's "interest of<br>
national security alone does not justify a prior restraint."<br>
          Judge Patel also held that the governments required licensing<br>
procedure<br>
fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.  When the Government acts<br>
legally to suppress protected speech, it must reduce the chance of illegal<br>
censorship by the bureaucrats involved -- in this case, the State<br>
Department's<br>
Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC).  Her decision states, "Because the<br>
ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide for a time limit on the licensing<br>
decision, for prompt judicial review and for a duty on the part of the ODTC<br>
to<br>
go to court and defend a denial of a license, the ITAR licensing scheme as<br>
applied to Category XIII(b) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in<br>
violation of the First Amendment."<br>
          She also ruled that the export controls restrict speech based on<br>
the<br>
content of the speech, not for any other reason.  "Category XIII(b) is<br>
directed very specifically at applied scientific research and speech on the<br>
topic of encryption."  The new regulations continue to insist that the<br>
Government is regulating the speech because of its function, not its content.<br>
          The judge also found that the ITAR is vague, because it does not<br>
adequately define how information that is available to the public "through<br>
fundamental research in science and engineering" is exempt from the export<br>
restrictions.  "This subsection,...does not give people...a reasonable<br>
opportunity to know what is prohibited."  Judge Patel also adopted a narrower<br>
definition of the term "defense article" in order to save it from<br>
unconstitutional vagueness.<br>
