I agree that they are facts; but ... (see last paragraph)<br>

I think the problem we're really having here is what Reilly Jones<br>
recently identified:<br>
"It is an exceedingly common error to mix up ontology with epistemology,<br>
with what is there, facts, with what we can know about them, our degrees<br>
of uncertainty, if you will.  Facts are facts, two things don't happen<br>
at the same moment, only one thing does.  We may see it dimly, or from<br>
different perspectives, but only one thing happens at any given instant<br>
of time."<br>
<p>
Aside from the fact that many things *do* happen at the same time (as<br>
Sarah Marr pointed out in her incisive response to Reilly), even from<br>
one observer's perspective, there are also cases where we can have a<br>
split perspective of the same individual thing.<br>
<p>
Here's an example that physicist David Bohm (of 'holographic universe'<br>
fame, or infamy to some) liked to use: Suppose there is a fish in a long<br>
rectangular tank with a camera at one end and another camera on the<br>
side.  Visitors to the aquarium only see two monitors, one of which<br>
shows a fish swimming straight toward them, the other showing a fish<br>
swimming laterally.  The observer could easily conclude that there are 2<br>
fish when, 'in fact', there is only one.  Now, what happens to the<br>
'fact' when we play a further trick by exchanging the fish for a<br>
computer simulation of a fish?<br>
<p>
I guess I can understand that there is a meaningful distinction between<br>
what exists (ontology) and what we can know about what exists<br>
(epistemology).  For example, I know that the Moon exists (unless it has<br>
somehow been destroyed since last night and I haven't heard about it<br>
yet) independently of my knowing it.  But, these are sort of macro or<br>
constant facts.  In more dynamic situations, I have trouble seeing what<br>
the use of ontology is - too many things we've never seen before have to<br>
pass through our perceptual filters, and our knowledge of them is so<br>
susceptible to distortion.  (Although, if I were blind and was hit by a<br>
car I couldn't see while crossing the street, the existence of that car<br>
would quickly become more important to me than my perception of it.)<br>
<p>
To make a long story short, I think I'm saying that, in most dynamic and<br>
novel situations, WE CANNOT 'SEE' THE FACTS DIRECTLY, only the portion<br>
of those facts that makes it through our sensors and pattern-matching<br>
routines.  While those portions may still be 'facts' in some ontological<br>
sense, from a practical perspective they may amount to an illusion in<br>
the limited context with which we interpret them.<br>
<p>
While I don't quite follow it, and it's probably easy to misuse, I think<br>
Ian Goddard's 'holistic logic' also makes this point that it's very<br>
difficult to identify a distinct fact apart from the environment in<br>
which it is embedded.  Yes, a tree that falls in the forest does make a<br>
sound even if we are not there to hear it; but, how can that be a fact<br>
*for us* (except perhaps through some vague, holistic  'butterfly<br>
effect')?<br>

the world has on you)."<br>
