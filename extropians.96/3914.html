As I have stated repeatedly, the underlying architecture won't place any<br>
real limits on the worlds people design.  But networks and computers are<br>
finite devices with precise organizations.  There is nothing "unlimited" or<br>
"uninhibited" about them.  This cannot be ignored.  The more robust the<br>
underlying architecture, the greater the level of freedom and options you'll<br>
actually have as a world designer.<br>
<p>
You have been giving me vague rhetorics which don't really deal with the<br>
actual issues and it is fairly apparent from your posts that you don't<br>
really understand the technology in the detail required to design a<br>
large-scale system of this type.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;As mentioned above, inter-client communication *requires* server-side</i><br>
<i>&gt;software.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Great, so let everyone be a server.</i><br>
<p>
Ummm... Few ISPs will let their users run server processes on their servers.<br>
So unless you plan to be online all day...<br>
