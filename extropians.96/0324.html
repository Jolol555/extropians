    Ye Squirrel formerly worked for MasPar Computer Corporation, which<br>
made guess what...  We had what the market seemed to consider a very<br>
good SIMD machine, with up to 16384 processors, each approximately<br>
equivalent to an 8086 in processing power, connected in rectangular<br>
array.  We had a couple of nice languages to program it in, too.<br>
Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be enough market to support an<br>
industry.  (When I say that the market seemed to consider our product<br>
very good, I refer to comparison surveys about reliability,<br>
programmability, and so on.)<br>
<p>
    I quit MasPar in late '94; within six months they had stopped<br>
producing hardware entirely, and are now -- renamed -- trying to<br>
recover anything they can from a variety of software developed while<br>
they were still producing hardware.<br>
