<i>                &gt;But the big question is if this prevents memory growth. [...] </i><br>

<i>                &gt;banks become prohibitive? </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that with reversible computing the  <br>
amount of energy needed to make a calculation can be made arbitrarily small  <br>
by slowing down the calculation a little. Even a small reduction in speed can  <br>
help a lot in energy saving, the power dissipation (per unit of time) falls <br>
as the SQUARE of the speed, and at the Omega point things will naturally speed  <br>
up because at the Big Crunch the parts of your computer will keep getting  <br>
closer together so it takes less time to send a message from one part to  <br>
another. More recently in the June 28 1996 issue of Science, Landauer shows  <br>
(in a interesting but non practical way) how you can also communicate and not  <br>
just compute information with an arbitrarily small amount of energy if you  <br>
are willing to slow things down. <br>
<p>
We'll never run out of energy to perform a calculation if the universe <br>
reverses it's expansion in a non symmetrical way and we have a big crunch.  <br>
We will have not a huge amount of usable lots of energy, we will have an <br>
infinite amount. Tipler's idea is to trade energy for subjective time, <br>
we have infinite energy  so we have infinite time.<br>
<p>
In an open universe you only have a finite amount of energy to work with, <br>
so you'll want to slow things way down, but other problems that Landauer did <br>
not  consider will force you to slow things even more, and use more energy <br>
too.  The components of your brain keep getting more distant so that's going <br>
to keep slowing things way down. Also, in order to establish reliable <br>
communication it's going to take more and more photons of light to send one  <br>
bit of information. It won't be easy for one part of a brain to hit it's  <br>
target a billion trillion light years away, not much chance if you only send  <br>
one photon. Also, each photon will be strongly and increasingly redshifted, <br>
to compensate the sender must keep shorting the wavelength of the photons he  <br>
uses, this takes more energy and you only have a finite amount of it. <br>

I don't see why that would be so.<br>
