<i>&gt;constant, on a week-to-month scale.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is certainly unprecendented.</i><br>
 <br>
Where do you folks think intelligence, the ability to solve mental<br>
problems, resides?  If we talk about speeding up brains, well those<br>
are just faster brains of the same intelligence.  If we talk about<br>
improving brains by giving them better software, i.e. better concepts<br>
and insights, well that is just brains of the same intelligence who<br>
know more.  Somewhere you think that there is some special central<br>
quality that remains fixed now, but will suddenly explode to higher and<br>
higher levels once agents can hack their hardware.<br>
<p>
Maybe, but maybe also what makes us smart is bascially what we know<br>
and how fast we can think - maybe there isn't much more that matters.<br>
If so, the ability to hack hardware will bring a big one-time jump in<br>
raw speed, which will slow down into diminishing returns as most of<br>
the easy speedups are found.  And maybe if there are some qualitative<br>
improvements possible in "basic intelligence", they won't be at all<br>
easy to find.<br>
