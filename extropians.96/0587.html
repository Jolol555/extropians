I'm a converted Extropian, or, at the least, a converted libertarian.<br>
I used to be quite the liberal but was always a little uncomfortable<br>
with that. Nonetheless, I still feel that deep within the extropian<br>
philosophy there are inherent contradictions that will remain subtle<br>
until forced to the foreground by what I see as a looming Singularity<br>
of possibility.<br>
<p>
I haven't read all that much on the nature of identity, and need to read<br>
Max's paper on this, but to me it seems an illusion. Let me illustrate<br>
with an example:<br>
<p>
Moravec writes (in _Mind Children_) about where the seat of identity<br>
is located. He points out that as long as your brain is intact, you can<br>
lose limbs and still feel you are the same person. I think this is an<br>
illusion caused by shared memory with the person you were previously.<br>
For example, if I lose a finger, I may still think I'm the same person,<br>
but I'm not, and will have to go thru a life with constant reminders<br>
that I'm missing a finger (I'm leaving out surgical/prosthetic options<br>
for this example). Let's expand on this with a scenario in which your <br>
spouse or loved one has a horrible accident:<br>
<p>
Option A is to save your spouse or loved one, except that he or she will<br>
be wheelchair-bound forever, with missing limbs and other (non-brain)<br>
damage. To the victim, he or she is still the same person, though they<br>
(and you) will have to adjust to a considerably different life.<br>
<p>
Option B is to replace this person with an exact clone, copying memories<br>
and so forth exactly. To you, this is the same person, although the<br>
person's original "I" is dead. However, everything you loved about the<br>
person, including memories, emotions, personaility, etc. is the same.<br>
<p>
I get the feeling that people would choose option A for themselves<br>
but option B for their loved ones. To make the choice even more difficult<br>
imagine that the loved one is also the primary provider for you and <br>
your family, and that option A means a lifetime of poverty and unending<br>
medical bills.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'm a different person after breakfast than before. I change<br>
all the time, as I suspect everyone else does too. Given advanced<br>
technology, I'd change myself even further. Maybe if you edit yourself<br>
only a little each day you can keep the illusion of continuous<br>
existence.<br>
<p>
I guess it comes down to my belief that the concept of identity will <br>
change considerably for transhumans and posthumans. Once you start<br>
spinning off replicants ("partials" in Greg Bear's lingo from Eon),<br>
re-integrating these later on, mixing memories with those of other<br>
people, editing your core beliefs, etc, things will get so hairy that<br>
I doubt we can even think intelligently about what the results will be.<br>
(But please try! It's of intense interest to me! :)<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
