I have been taking it for about 1.5 months and have put on four pounds of<br>
body mass.  I have noticed that my muscle growth is continuing, and<br>
apparently the four pounds is muscle - as I have not put on any fat.  (I'm<br>
cautious about this.)<br>

Dr. Ray Sahelian has information about creatine on his Web site:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.primenet.com/~sahelian">http://www.primenet.com/~sahelian</a><br>
<p>
"Creatine is a natural nutrient found in our bodies and the bodies of most<br>
animals. Approximately 95% of the body's creatine supply is found in the<br>
skeletal muscles. The remaining 5% is scattered throughout the rest of the<br>
body, with the highest concentrations in the heart, brain and testes. <br>
<p>
"Creatine has also been shown to enhance your body's ability to make<br>
proteins, especially the proteins within the muscle fibers. Two of these<br>
proteins, actin and myosin, are essential to all muscle contraction. So when<br>
you build up your supply of these contractile proteins, you actually<br>
increase your muscle's ability to perform physical work. And the more work<br>
you do (whether it's lifting weights or running 100-meter dashes), the<br>
stronger you become over time."<br>
<p>
I take one heaping teaspoon full 1/2 to 1 hour before heading to the gym.<br>
The psychological effect is positive in that I push more weight and focus my<br>
sets because I want to work in tandem with the creatine.<br>
<p>
The downside, for me as an example, is that I get a stomach ache after<br>
taking the creatine.  This could be because I usually take it on an empty<br>
stomach, and because I don't like the taste of it, I mix it with cranberry<br>
juice.<br>
