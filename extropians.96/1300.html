It is. A von-Neumann probe has a negligeable size, loss of its mass would <br>
not be felt on system scale. Idea space is infinite, as the amount of <br>
states a system has is also a function of the number of atoms is contains. <br>
<p>
Unless computation can be detached from the material carrier, both mass <br>
and energy are scarce resources. A need for expansion seems logical. <br>
Since such expansion is not observable, we must assume a sequence of <br>
filters, or the transcendence scenario. Personally, I like the <br>
transcension scenario a lot better.<br>

You are right, of course. But the intelligence of the atomic agents has <br>
remained a virtual constant. Only the degree of cooperation has <br>
increased. But we're talking about autofeedback loop upon both the number <br>
of agents _and_ grain size of their intelligence. With a very short time <br>
constant, on a week-to-month scale.<br>
<p>
This is certainly unprecendented.<br>

<p>
This is interesting. A year ago, that would be the old extropian list? <br>
Hal, can you possibly repost the text? It sounds highly intriguing.<br>
