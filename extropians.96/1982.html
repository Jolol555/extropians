I think we need something more than just your pronouncements to take this<br>
seriously.  How about a press release, or even a signed letter from the<br>
Chair of CMU Computer Science department?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ira, how can you confidently say "way above anything yet achieved</i><br>

<p>
<p>
Lyle, how could I possibly say, with confidence, anything more?  What is<br>
this new AI?  How is it an advance over previous AI?  Has it been subjected<br>
to any independent evaluations?  Again, all we have to go on are your<br>
personal pronouncements.<br>
<p>
I don't know you.  If you represent CMU's Comp. Sci. department, and this<br>
is an official announcement, please say so.<br>
<p>
BTW, my not-insignificant business experience is that most breakthroughs<br>
are achieved incrementally.  In rare instances, a "quantum leap" may be<br>
achieved when many individuals and organizations work in close<br>
collaboration for an extended time (e.g., the first moon landing).<br>
<p>
I'm sure AI will continue to improve.  But I'm skeptical that anyone<br>
working in relative isolation will suddenly discover a magic bullet.  Does<br>
anyone on this list know of a promising and significant AI technology<br>
within reach of a "group of students"?<br>
