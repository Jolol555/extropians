An idea I've been amusing myself with a bit, relating to the question<br>
of how hard it will be to generate AI using nanotech is this: suppose a<br>
genii gives you an infinitely fast computer.  This is a computer just<br>
like today's, programmable in C or Lisp or some other language, which<br>
had the property that it runs infinitely fast.  Any program you put on<br>
it completes instantly (unless it is of the type which never completes,<br>
in which case it runs forever until you halt it).  All computation is<br>
done in zero time.  We'll also throw in infinite memory while we're at<br>
it, although I'm not sure how big the C pointers have to be then :-).<br>
<p>
The question is, given such a miraculous device, how hard would it be<br>
for you, meaning the typical programmer reading this, to produce a program<br>
which could pass the Turing test, or better still one which is super-<br>
intelligent?  Where would you start?  How long would it take you to write<br>
the code?  What research would you have to do?  Could it even be done?<br>
<p>
Or, if it is too hard for one average person to do, what would be the<br>
team which could do it?  How long do you think it would take?  How big<br>
would the resulting program be?<br>
<p>
What I'm trying to get at in this thought experiment is just how hard<br>
it would be to get AI if we had computers which were not infinitely<br>
fast, but still very very fast (or more properly, parallel computers<br>
with extremely massive degrees of parallelism) as we might expect from<br>
nanotech.  So it would be most interesting if the solution works for<br>
computers which aren't quite infinitely fast.  But if there were some<br>
trick which worked especially well on infinitely fast computers that<br>
would be interesting to hear about, too.<br>
