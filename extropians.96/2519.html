Well, I know quite a bit about computer security myself, at least in one<br>
environment - the MOO.  Due to a number of basic security flaws and<br>
human fallibility, it is generally possible for a sufficiently creative<br>
and clever fellow - such as yours truly - to crack the security without<br>
stepping outside the environment of the MOO.  (Although, of course, I<br>
worked on the side of the angels, attempting to create uncrackable<br>
systems and fair RPG games.)<br>
<p>
As I understand it, most modern computer security centers around the<br>
password.  Crackers try to get it, and security folk try to defend it. <br>
This doesn't much resemble the perversion attacks pictured in<br>
cyberspace, and might not resemble the future.<br>
<p>
Cracking a MOO - again, without intercepting a wizard's password or<br>
faking a net packet on a wizardly connection - consists of finding<br>
numerous 'small' conceptual flaws in the system and linking them into a<br>
fatal chain.  Take LambdaMOO's RPG as an example.  One bug I found - and<br>
was made a GM for - involved an unsupervised call to the method<br>
:magic_effect on the room one was in.  In other words, it called the<br>
method and allowed it to alter the amount of magic present without<br>
checking to see who owned the method, whether said player was a GM,<br>
nada.  So of course, any player could hack a :magic_effect on the room<br>
one was in, and cast incredibly powerful spells.<br>
<p>
The point of this sad story - and it frankly isn't all that sad, I chose<br>
that bug because it was one of the few that were surface errors rather<br>
than fundamental flaws, and so was fixed and is no longer classified -<br>
is that it doesn't even take an SI to go through MOO security like<br>
tissue paper, just a year or so of experience.  While the computers of<br>
the future are likely to be more secure than MOOs, they are also likely<br>
to resemble the MOO in that they will contain huge masses of slightly<br>
flawed code, and will be cracked or perverted from the inside rather<br>
than the outside.  Forget passwords, forget forged packets; those are<br>
simple problems that will either be solved by encryption or rendered<br>
moot by Deutsch transistors or ansibles or God-knows-what.<br>
<p>
A superintelligence, even a new and inexperienced one, will go through<br>
the computer security of the future without even trying.<br>
