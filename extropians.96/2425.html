I don't think there are many doctors who believe that "it is superstitious, <br>
immoral, WRONG to take vitamins"; BUT, there are still a lot of doctors who <br>
believe that health management is too complex for the average person to <br>
handle without a doctor's guidance.  Therefore, they are opposed to people <br>
being able to take supplements and medication off the shelf.<br>
<p>
What can we do about it?  Well, the trend away from private practice toward <br>
managed care is already doing a lot about it.  Insurance companies are <br>
unlikely to pay for a visit to the doctor if all you want is some vitamins <br>
or other supplements.<br>
