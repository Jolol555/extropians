<i>&gt;On 9/25/96, Sarah Marr had some comments on my post of 9/24/96.  I didn't see</i><br>

<i>&gt;is impossible to criticize unresisting imbecility."</i><br>
<p>
Congratulations. I think you've won a prize for the most unpleasant and ad<br>
feminam comment I've ever read on this or the &gt;H list.<br>
<p>
Generally, however, I'd say you should be more keen to respond. My<br>
experience of this list is that people always speak out if the disagree with<br>
something, but don't if they simply agree. So I would have interpreted a<br>
lack of responses to my original mail as agreement by the list, not<br>
disagreement (and hence disagreement with you).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sarah Marr: &lt;If I'm right, then more than one thing can happen at any given</i><br>
<i>&gt;instant of time.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If two utterly contradictory events occur at the exact same time, and at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;exact same place, then you must explain how there can be such a concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth...</i><br>
<p>
&lt;big snip&gt;<br>
<p>
Where did I, or you, mention contradicatory events? Where did I, or you,<br>
mention the same place? What, in short, are you talking about? There's<br>
nothing to stop two events occuring at the same time. It's not surprising<br>
you can refute a claim by me, if you suddenly assert that I've added two<br>
extra clauses about place and contradiction. But feel free to counter _my_<br>
argument, which has no recourse to those latter two concepts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;RJ: &lt;Really, tolerance in practice is simply indifference.  To tolerate</i><br>
<i>&gt;something is to be indifferent to it, meaning it does not threaten your person</i><br>
<i>&gt;or your way of life (which is nearly inseparable from your person) and holds no</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest to you.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;A lot of tolerance involves 'putting up with' something which does</i><br>
<i>&gt;affect your way of life, and which you are not indifferent to.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I cannot understand this.  If something, really I should say someone, affects</i><br>
<i>&gt;your life, they either a) help you, or b) hinder you.</i><br>
<p>
Nope. They may help you in some ways, and hinder you in others. Then it's a<br>
balancing act. If you don't believe this, then just come up with a coherent<br>
rebuttable of each of the examples I gave in my last mail, and that'll be fine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...they are indifferent to them, which is also a form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;disapproval or patronization.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I always disapprove of things about which I'm indifferent. I mean, what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;...toleration is based on the balancing of feelings of the individual, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;hir own personal happiness. These are personal decisions based on personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;feelings, they do not require recourse to the concept of group-worth.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am not an adherent of emotivism.  If toleration is to be held up as a virtue,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as something of high worth...</i><br>
<p>
I don't remember doing that. I just tried to explain what toleration<br>
actually is: no judgement call.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What's</i><br>
<i>&gt;your definition of "justice," in such a "feeling" driven worldview?  Why is</i><br>
<i>&gt;"happiness" important?  Does "happiness" point to the Good also?  Or is</i><br>
<i>&gt;"happiness" the Good itself?  Why should we care about "feelings" or</i><br>
<i>&gt;"happiness"</i><br>
<i>&gt;at all?</i><br>
<p>
I base the answers to these questions on feelings, so you wouldn't accept<br>
them anyway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If tolerance of others is based on "feelings," then is intolerance of</i><br>
<i>&gt;others equally acceptable, as long as it is equally based on "feelings"?</i><br>
Why &gt;or why not?<br>
<p>
You're confusing the feelings which _are_ tolerance and intolerance with<br>
feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance.<br>
<p>
An individual's feelings include tolerance and intolerance, but that<br>
individual's feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance may differ, to the<br>
point of opposition, i.e. it is valid for an individual to feel that<br>
tolerance is a good thing whilst feeling that intolerance is a bad thing.<br>
Personally, however, I don't attach such value judgements to tolerance or<br>
intolerance: i.e. I would not make a blanket statement that tolerance is<br>
good. I choose to tolerate some things, and not tolerate others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM:  &lt;...none of us has to agree to anything, do we?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Only if we decide to opt completely out of social life.  Are we still human</i><br>
<i>&gt;then?  In what sense?  This sounds like an expression of vacant freedom to me,</i><br>
<i>&gt;devoid of content.</i><br>
<p>
Nope. All I'm saying is we don't 'have to' agree to anything. Personally, I<br>
think it would be stupid to always disagree, and generally I'm a fairly<br>
agreaable person, I think. But I could always take a call to be continually<br>
bloody-minded and accept the resulting isolation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;It's not a question of a threat to the person or to one's way of life,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that's too simplistic. It's to do with the nature of that threat, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;personal balancing of priorities and desires.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm a simple kinda guy.  Desires aren't balanced, they're indulged or denied.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remember, only one thing at a time happens.</i><br>
<p>
I love X. I hate Y. I want to have sex with Z. At the same time. Why not?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...if you tolerate your destroyers, there will soon be no way for you</i><br>
<i>&gt;to "honor diversity."</i><br>
<p>
Sure. But my balance would place diversity above being destroyed, so I<br>
wouldn't be in that situation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is no way to produce individuals who all aim for</i><br>
<i>&gt;reconcilable ideals, or harmonious worldviews, unless humanity's volitional</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom is engineered out.</i><br>
<p>
Sure. I've been talking about the individual, not the collective, consciousness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;RJ: &lt;I get the creeps any time I see the word "tolerance" any more.  The word</i><br>
<i>&gt;has been badly abused by the holier-than-thou politically correct brigades, who</i><br>
<i>&gt;virtually always mean "intolerance" when they use it.  Likewise, when they say</i><br>
<i>&gt;"inclusive," they mean "exclusive"; when they say</i><br>
<i>&gt;"multicultural," they mean "monocultural"; when they say "open-minded," they</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean "closed-minded"; and when they say "diversity," they mean "perversity."&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;I don't believe you. Please give some concrete examples to prove your</i><br>
<i>&gt;point.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;OK, personal experience is a feeble and lame source of proof...</i><br>
<p>
Proof-schmoof. I was using the word in it's everyday way, not with any deep<br>
conceptualized thinking behind it. I merely meant, please share your<br>
experiences, because I've never come across this, and would be interested.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...a worldview that says that all human ideals can be harmonized...</i><br>
<p>
There are certain things I believe in and of which I will seek to gain<br>
acceptance from others. But I will do that with cogent argument, and allow<br>
those others to make up their own minds. And if a majority agree maybe<br>
things will change. Everybody else should have the same chance to put their<br>
point of view. So it is those listening who change human ideals, not those<br>
talking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sarah again: &lt;I don't believe theories predict what will happen, they only</i><br>
<i>&gt;predict what might happen. Otherwise they wouldn't be theoretical.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Theories predict, not what "might" happen, which could be anything, but</i><br>
what &gt;the<br>
<i>&gt;experimenter *expects* to happen...</i><br>
<p>
OK. Let's dump 'will', dump 'might' and go with 'expects'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sarah again: &lt;To say observation needs a theory behind it is not true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Observation often leads to discovery: it is an error of causality to say</i><br>
<i>&gt;observation _must_ have some theory behind it; it is quite possible for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;theory to evolve from the observation.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You cannot observe anything at all without your brain performing some</i><br>
<i>&gt;perceptual categorization prior to pattern recognition.</i><br>
<p>
So what was the theory that Brown had when he observed Brownian motion for<br>
the first time? Remember you're trying to insist on theory _before_<br>
observation, not after the start of observation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When you observe</i><br>
<i>&gt;something in tandem with others, you must speak the same theory-laden language</i><br>
<i>&gt;and come to a consensus as to what you have observed.</i><br>
<p>
Nope. You speak after you've observed, or at least, after you've started to<br>
observe.<br>
