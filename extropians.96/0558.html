I very much like the thoughts you've posted and the new interpretations<br>
you've made of the notion of individual freedom, particularly your emphasis<br>
that one limits ones own freedom in a way compatible with ones own<br>
self-determination.<br>
<p>
One of the problems of emphasis that I've had with the notion of Unlimited<br>
Individual Freedom is that many of those who like this phrasing seem to see<br>
themselves as somehow completely independent of the world and the people in<br>
it. This way of looking at things seems self-impoverishing to me.<br>
<p>
Most of my own self-determination has been a matter of choice about who I<br>
choose to interact with and how I choose to interact with them. Most of my<br>
good ideas about how to improve myself and extend my own abilities have<br>
arisen from a study of what other people have accomplished and what other<br>
people have to offer. And my studies of market phenomena (including the<br>
market of ideas as well as the market of material goods and services) have<br>
shown me that my own power and abilities are maximized to the extent that I<br>
optimize my interaction with those who have good things to offer me. Other<br>
people have created so many of the good ideas that I have chosen to<br>
incorporate into myself!<br>
<p>
Choosing to limit my own freedom in certain ways (e. g. being polite,<br>
respecting the property rights of others, keeping promises that I make to<br>
others) enriches me, by enhancing the opportunities for other people to<br>
think of and create things that benefit me in the long run. And I can get<br>
the most out of other people by turning my mind to, among other things, how<br>
I can help them get what they want in turn. (And isn't that the only<br>
surefire method for making lots of money in a market system?)<br>
<p>
I've been studying a lot of philosophy for the last few years, and over and<br>
over again I've examined a proposed philosophical problem only ultimately<br>
to decide that the problem was created by a false dichotomy. (Genuine<br>
unsolved philosophical problems do exist, and I'm still quite interested in<br>
those.) But just as Dennett argues in _Elbow Room_ that the dichotomy<br>
between free will and determinism is a false one, that all persons are free<br>
to *some* degree and determined to *some* degree, I've recently decided<br>
that the debates in moral philosophy over egoism versus altruism are<br>
similarly resolved. I've become a compatibilist on this issue: I can best<br>
benefit myself in the long run by acquiring and using the skills that most<br>
benefit other people (and the market rewards us for this above all else),<br>
and I can best benefit others by making sure I keep myself comfortable,<br>
sane, skilled, and wealthy... or in other words, happy. And of course by<br>
recognizing that I, like anything as complex as a person, am unique, and<br>
making sure that I bring out the best in myself that I have to offer,<br>
because no one else in the world is going to be able to offer the world<br>
that, and I want to make sure the world doesn't lose out on that.<br>
<p>
The only difficulty left with this position in ethics is usefully<br>
explaining it to young children, who naturally like to see the world in<br>
black and white. But I'm not a parent (at least not yet), so I'll let that<br>
problem sit for a while.<br>
<p>
There are still lots of interesting problems left in moral philosophy<br>
though. The big question is: what to do? I'm still working on the answer to<br>
that one, and it keeps changing every day.<br>
