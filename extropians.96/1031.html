Sure.  But of course "careful" doesn't imply "agree".<br>

<p>
I and other folks around here have run lots of experiments with human<br>
subjects.  I'm not sure what you mean by "objective and repeatable" or<br>
"limit the number of variables", so I can't yet compare them to your<br>
criteria.  It is easy to limit the number of things you vary within<br>
your experiment.  Bad experiments often vary too few things.  And<br>
experiments are commonly repeated to see if the same phenomena is observed.<br>
<p>
I'll also note that many "sciences" such as astronomy and geology rely<br>
almost entirely on observation.  Others, such as evolutionary biology,<br>
find it very difficult to eliminate variance within the samples they<br>
experiment on.<br>
