I agree, it does blow the mind. Sorry to post a "me too" answer but I<br>
believe that these are the truest words I've heard in a longtime. If we hold<br>
faith (hate this word) in spontaneous orders and evolution because they've<br>
always had results eventually leading to what we call good aspects then I<br>
guess you could say that it doesn't matter what occurs, the good memes will<br>
survive.<br>
