<i>&gt;If gene therapy for humans started at least by 1990, then wouldn't it be </i><br>
<i>&gt;possible to use that technology for genetic re-creation. Example: If I </i><br>
<i>&gt;had the money and the right doctor, could I isolate the "novelty" gene, </i><br>
<i>&gt;whip up an elixir, shot it up (or perhaps inhale it in aerosol form), to </i><br>
<i>&gt;give myself a "high" that made me want to pursue "novel" (or perhaps </i><br>
<i>&gt;there's an extropian gene) ideas, ways and means?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I'm the person you wish to isolate the gene from because i _do_<br>
experience a euphoria or high thinking about the future or generating ideas<br>
and I hope I'm not alone in this matter but I don't know. I believe that<br>
this would be more environmental though you could probably manipulate genes<br>
to encourage intellectual behavior leading to this conclusion. You could<br>
write the encouragement data directly to the brain with a virus or nanites<br>
but i'd be tricky. My best bet to encourage these ideas are through a<br>
_really good_ positive movie to stir up funding and debate such as Jurassic<br>
Park accomplished. But a movie on what topic?<br>
