Steric means the space filling properties of a molecule. If all molecules had <br>
an exact shape and were perfectly rigid, things would be pretty <br>
straightforward, but of course they are not, a Nanotechnology engineer would <br>
ignore this at his peril. It's not always a disadvantage however, just as in <br>
our Macro world, if something doesn't quite fit you can often give it a good <br>
whack and make it fit. Chemists also have a term called "Steric Hindrance", <br>
it refers to the slowing of a chemical reaction because some part of a <br>
molecule mechanically gets in the way. This is very important in large <br>
biological molecules and depending on the circumstances it can be a help or a <br>
hindrance to the Nanotechnology engineer, but either way he must have a <br>
understanding of it. There is a lot more about it in Nanosystems.<br>
