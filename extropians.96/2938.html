<i>&gt; I can't argue with most of your last post.  Just one point:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Witnesses and the public statement of a DEMOCRAT who has long experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in White House and other high level government business. 157 eye</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;witnesses corroborating each other is a much bigger statistical lump to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;dismiss than just a few confused reports. If facts are not true, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;typically are widely varied in being described by witnesses. When they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;all agree, that typically means that is accceptable as a fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought the witnesses said they saw what looked like a missile -- not</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they specifically saw a missile fired by a US Navy vessel.</i><br>
<p>
If 157 people all said some form of: "I saw what looked like a missile,<br>
I saw a missile, I may have seen a missile, etc" chances are that there<br>
is some truth to their statements.  If there are on the other hand many<br>
wildly contradictory stories, then an investigator assigns probability<br>
values to various pieces of  each story based on the amount of<br>
corroboration. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I have never said the investigators should rule out the Navy as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible suspect.  Honest investigators will go through many suspects, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; hopefully they will only accuse the one who is actually guilty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But maybe I have missed something.  Please tell me what factual evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is that TWA Flight 800 was shot down by a Navy missile.  I still</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know who is the "AI" on this list, so maybe I also missed the Navy</i><br>
<i>&gt; missile evidence.</i><br>
<p>
Eyewitness accounts are considered factual evidence, are they not?<br>
The fact that much remains classified is a smoking gun in and of itself.<br>
<p>
Using your pet theory, that the French Intelligence servicess are<br>
somehow stirring things up, I can also see a possible scenario: that<br>
French Agents were escaping US jurisdiction on the plane with some<br>
extremely dangerous intelligence. Navy Captain, at the direction of the<br>
DIA or NSA, says, " Fish food, anyone?" This idea is only as implausble<br>
as your rationalization.<br>
<p>
