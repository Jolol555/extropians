<i>&gt;  &gt; standard means of dispersal is a burning type grenade. While in Korea </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I set up tear gas chambers for NBC defense training where the method </i><br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; cases I have stood in the resulting aerosol sans mask for extended periods</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; (once you're used to it, CS is not all that incapacitating even in pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; high levels). I daresay that if there were significant levels of cyanide</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; generated from heating of CS in a normal flame, I would have seen the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; gray skin, and malaise that comes with cyanide poisoning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: CS manufacturers such as Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wisconsin state in their official company literature on CS, that when </i><br>
<i>&gt; burned CS emits toxic fumes, such as hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen </i><br>
<i>&gt; chloride. The Aldrich company also states that if water is poured </i><br>
<i>&gt; on burning CS, a lethal cloud of hydrogen cyanide can be released.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even more, the toxic and flammable agent methyl chloride, used in </i><br>
<i>&gt; Waco to cause the CS dust to become suspended in the air, when burned</i><br>
<i>&gt; releases extremely toxic phosgene gas (Trial transcript: 5735, 5756, </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5916, 5921). (BTW, I'm told that the trial transcripts are now on </i><br>
<i>&gt; the web but I do not know the URL, a search should uncover them.) </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is even an aerial photo of the Mt. Carmel shortly after the fire </i><br>
<i>&gt; breaks out, in which the whole center is in a cloud of white smoke, it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; believed that this cloud is a phosgene-cyanide gas cloud. Both hydrogen</i><br>
<i>&gt; cyanide and phosgene gas were used in the Nazi's gas chambers before </i><br>
<i>&gt; zyklon-B was used.  Waco, TX: Auschwitz USA. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, a report by Amnesty International confirmed that CS and CN gas </i><br>
<i>&gt; had lead to the deaths of over 40 Palestinians, including 18 babies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who had all been exposed, like the Davidians, to tear-gas in enclosed </i><br>
<i>&gt; spaces. As a result of this report, American manufacturers halted </i><br>
<i>&gt; sales of tear-gas to the Israeli govt (The Davidan Massacre, p.294-5). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It must be that the CS you dispersed was simply carried up quickly by </i><br>
<i>&gt; the radiant heat of the flame rather than actually burning and thus </i><br>
<i>&gt; releasing toxic fumes. I would imagine that you may still have </i><br>
<i>&gt; had low-level cyanide exposure. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I too have had repeated, excessive exposure to CS gas.  Unlike, the above <br>
described NBC gas chamber,  many of my experiences were delivered via <br>
grenades producing clouds so thick I couldn't see my hands in front of <br>
my face.  I never suffered any ill effects (beyond those you would <br>
expect) and eventually built quite a tolerance to the stuff.  <br>
<p>
However, the burning dispersal system on military grenades is a <br>
fairly temperature controlled environment.  It heats it enough to <br>
vaporize and eject the CS, but not usually hot enough to cause <br>
decomposition of the material.  This may have been the difference <br>
with the Waco incident.  The internal temperatures of that complex <br>
would have easily exceeded the decomposition point for CS.<br>
<p>
Also, it is known to be technically possible to produce a fatality with CS.  The <br>
difference between military CS and the more civilian CN tear gas is <br>
that CS is a mixture of CN (non-lethal) and small quantities of <br>
another chemical weapon that is known to have lethal properties.  <br>
Excessive exposure to the second component could kill you.  I don't <br>
remember the name of the second component off the top of my head, but <br>
it dates back to WWII or so.<br>
<p>
The second component is added to give the normal teargas more kick.  <br>
CN causes burning and tearing and that's about it.  The second <br>
component causes severe nausea, cramps, etc. and generally makes you <br>
have a bad day.<br>
