I've been here long enough to lean towards the noisy loop theory here...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My question is, has the following been discussed on the list, or does</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone have any opinions about it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In ch.4 of his book _Elemental Mind_, Nick Herbert describes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; little-known Spacetime Reductive Materialism (SRM) theories of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness proposed by California PolyTechnic professor James</i><br>
<i>&gt; Culbertson (author of _The Minds Of Robot_, 1963, and _Consciousness:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Natural &amp; Artificial_, 1984, which, as Herbert notes, "has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; generally dismissed by mainstream scientists as quirky and</i><br>
<i>&gt; impractical"). SRM models are based on reflection points, influence</i><br>
<i>&gt; trees and outlook trees described by 3 attributes: intensity, quality &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; connectiveness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Not that I know of. Nick is an acquaintance of mine, and I've never <br>
heard him discuss this (but neither were the circumstances appropriate).<br>
Would you kindly provide a summary of this POV?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Superficially this sounds like it might be a useful model of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness, but then Herbert goes on to add, "Culbertson's answer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the evolutionary question [of why consciousness is advantageous] is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of their ability to store memories in spacetime. rather than in</i><br>
<i>&gt; space, conscious computers can perform the same job as unconscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers  and require fewer parts to do so ... a conscious computer ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; can access events that have happened long ago, events that lie 'outside'</i><br>
<i>&gt; the computer's present state ... [having the advantage of] a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; invisible spacetime 'hard disk' - that could give conscousness a</i><br>
<i>&gt; competitive edge in the Darwinian struggle for existence." (p134).</i><br>
<p>
This makes no sense to me... Rather than extending time as a dimension,<br>
resulting in a frozen spacetime succession of states, I go the other<br>
way,<br>
that time is a notion created by memory, and does not actually exist.<br>
What<br>
does exist are records indicating series of events which are<br>
interepreted<br>
as time...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All of this seems to imply that memories and experiences might somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt; be distributed in the environment through which we have passed</i><br>
<p>
Yes in lots of ways, but a fossil has no meaning except to a mind which<br>
itself<br>
is realised physically. Easy to fall into New Age stuff here...<br>
