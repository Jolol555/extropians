<i>&gt;                &gt;this would not be *your* consciousness that was uploaded.</i><br>
                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;What was uploaded was your memories, thoughts, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see where our fundamental disagreement is. You say we have memories, </i><br>
<i>&gt;thoughts and feelings; I say we ARE memories, thoughts and feelings. You say </i><br>
<i>&gt;we are an object, a noun. I say we are an adjective, we are the way matter </i><br>
<i>&gt;reacts when it is organized in certain ways. True, matter is needed for us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;exist, but that's not the important part because any matter will do, good </i><br>
<i>&gt;thing too, the matter in your body is quite different than it was a year</i><br>
ago. <br>
<i>&gt;The important thing is the way the matter is organized, the information.   </i><br>
<p>
Take a look at dreams! In a dream state, you can lower your access level to<br>
information in your brain such as the concept of being in a house in a<br>
dream and your brain 'knows' whats in the room you're about to enter but<br>
you yourself do not which provides evidence for memory and consciousness<br>
being two seporate functions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You can't move the information from Floppy Disk A to Floppy Disk B </i><br>
<i>&gt;without making a copy.  It isn't possible.</i><br>
<p>
But you can take the magnetic media on the inside of the floppy casing and<br>
move it physically to the inside of another floppy case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even if we were able to understand how </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence operates,  is it possible to "reorganize" or extend the </i><br>
<i>&gt;architechture of the brain without causing changes in consciousness?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;It may be my own limitations, but I can't help but think that </i><br>
<i>&gt;although our intelligence could be extended fairly easily, our </i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness is irremovably tied to the overall structure of our </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain.</i><br>
<p>
This is why incrememtal gradual uploading is required so that you 'grow'<br>
into your new brain by writing new data into it. You would be required to<br>
be functioning normally while the uploading is occurring so that you<br>
maintain your consciousness through the trip. Static uploads cause clones.<br>
After the upload is entirely complete you could shut down the manual<br>
sensory input and kick back in VR paradise.<br>
