Regarding the discussion of labor vs. management and labor vs. capital,<br>
here's a question I've toyed with over the years and to which I've been<br>
unable to come up with satisfactory answers:<br>
<p>
     Why isn't there more competition between "unions"?<br>
<p>
I can see price competition between unions driving wages down without great<br>
benefit to workers, especially toward the unskilled side of the spectrum.  On<br>
the other hand, I can see unions competing in two directions: To provide good<br>
labor-service at a competitive price on the one hand and to provide good<br>
social services to their members on the other.  In theory, simple price might<br>
not be the only index of competition on the "labor sales" side if unions that<br>
offered better social services (group health plans, education co-ops, etc.)<br>
attracted higher-quality workers.<br>
<p>
Any thoughts from the less economically-retarded than me?<br>
