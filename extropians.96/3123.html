The reason that the magnification of a light microscope is so limited is that <br>
the wavelength of light is large. The obvious solution is to use light of a <br>
shorter wavelength, because the resolution is equal to the wavelength of the <br>
light times the focal length of the lens divided by the aperture of the lens.<br>
The difficulty is that when you go beyond the near ultraviolet there didn't <br>
seem to be any way to make a lens. Aluminum is almost as transparent to hard <br>
(over 14 kev) X rays as glass is to light, but the index of refraction is so <br>
tiny that the focal length of a simple lens would be huge, far too long to be<br>
practical. Heavier elements like Gold have a higher index of refraction, but <br>
they strongly absorb X rays, your lens would be almost completely opaque.<br>
<p>
This is also a serious obstacle to using X rays in photolithography to make <br>
very tiny semiconductor devices. If you don't have any optical elements then <br>
you can't optically reduce the size of your image, your mask must be as small <br>
as the very microprocessor you're trying to make, and you must place it right <br>
on top of the silicon, as in a contact sheet in  photography. None of this <br>
seemed very workable to most people.<br>
<p>
In the November 7 1996 issue of Nature is an article called "A Compound  <br>
Refractive Lens For Focusing High Energy X Rays" by Snigirev, Kohn, Snigireva <br>
and Lengeler. They found a easy and cheap way to focus very Hard X  Rays, <br>
up to about 40 kev. Their lens is simply an Aluminum block with holes of <br>
radius .3 millimeter drilled into it, it looks like this:   <br>
                   <br>
<p>
                     _____________________<br>
    ---------------&gt; | o o o o o o o o o |<br>
    X Rays           | o o o o o o o o o |              .   &lt;---  Focal Point<br>
    ---------------&gt; | o o o o o o o o o |  <br>
    ---------------&gt; |-------------------|<br>
                   <br>
<p>
Each hole drilled into the Aluminum block is a lens, one lens may give you a <br>
ridiculously long focal length, but 2 will cut that distance in half, <br>
this first device has 30 lenses.  The focal length of their compound lens <br>
is R/ 2NI, R is the radius of the holes, N is the number of holes, and I is <br>
the index of refraction in the X ray region of the material. In this lens the <br>
holes are cylinders so the X rays are focused in only 2 dimensions, for 3 <br>
you'd need spheres not cylinders. The authors don't seem to think it would be <br>
very difficult to make a device with hundreds, perhaps thousands of such <br>
lenses. The authors also calculate that if they could make the holes in a <br>
parabolic shape they could  reduce the focal length by a further factor of 5. <br>
Although they haven't tried it yet they also think the same lens could also <br>
focus something else that was thought to be impossible, a beam of neutrons.<br>
<p>
Aluminum was used in this case because it's easy to machine, but boron, <br>
carbon, plastic and even water should work too. It occurs to me that it might <br>
not be too difficult to make an array of small spherical bubbles in water, <br>
they wouldn't stay in place for long but they wouldn't need to, the X rays <br>
from a laser would be in a VERY short burst.<br>
