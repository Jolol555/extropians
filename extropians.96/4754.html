I see the creation of Extropian holidays as a bad thing because there are<br>
better, far more successful ways of spreading our memes as well as it would<br>
destroy art. Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc aren't religious holidays,<br>
they're commercial ventures. Anyone supporting them is supporting<br>
capitalism and the free market. Ever heard of After-Christmas sales?<br>
Christians have attempted to religicize the Pagan winter solstice which was<br>
far more creative. Do we really want to copy what the christians did and<br>
are still trying to do now that there is a growing decline in the<br>
"christian" meaning of Christmas? The art is back and the religious meaning<br>
is declining. The Santa Claus meme is art that morphs and evolves as the<br>
years pass, by artists, writers, and companies like Coca cola. Santa has<br>
evolved over the years and will continue to evolve. The wreath, christmas<br>
tree, christmas lights on houses, mistletoe, santa claus, elves, reindeer,<br>
rudolph, etc are all highly intricate and intailed art. Lets not try to<br>
make the same mistake the Christians made.<br>

"Some people dream about worthy accomplishments while others stay<br>
 awake and do them."<br>
