&lt;No. that is not what I was referring to.&gt;<br>
<p>
Then are you referring to mechanisms like Vickery's auction and your own<br>
Idea Futures?  What would economists call the type of mechanisms (for<br>
trying to modulate chaotic systems, rather than eliminate them) that I<br>
was referring to?<br>
<p>
Robin also wrote:<br>
&lt;I think you have assumed that such a huge nanofog must be homogeneous.<br>
Instead, it could support far more diversity and creativity and<br>
exploration of new tech than could vastly smaller civilizations.<br>
And why need the actions of such a civilization be "pre-programmed"?&gt;<br>
<p>
True, such an expanding nanofog wouldn't be homogeneous *if* it allowed<br>
diversity and creativity.  But the discussion with Forrest Bishop gave<br>
me the impression that such a civilization would need an almost<br>
totalitarian control of its members in order to "hit and run" and avoid<br>
detection (low profile scenario), OR just to maintain its momentum and<br>
keep everyone committed to the 'pave it over', bigger-is-better strategy<br>
even if some might prefer to drop out and become independent agrarian<br>
planet huggers.  As you wrote (Friday, October 11, 1996):<br>
&lt;Within any system, keeping the quiet is a public good, so a strong<br>
central policing might be required to enforce it.&gt;<br>
<p>
By "pre-programmed" I was thinking that such a civilization would<br>
require a strict constitution and would use only approved designs in<br>
order to be 'optimal', rather than let market mechanisms, technology and<br>
cultural modes continue to evolve spontaneously.  Would such an<br>
optimized and designed civilization have any use for evolutionary<br>
algorithms (like random mutation and cross-over) or would these be<br>
considered too inefficient for the public good once optimized mechanisms<br>
have been established?<br>
