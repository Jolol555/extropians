<i>&gt; &gt;friendly to me.  I have also been treated in a friendly manner by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;staff in public parks, swimming pools, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suggest the following scale:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...... rude and deceitful</i><br>
<i>&gt; STATE GOVERNMENT........ lazy and slow to respond</i><br>
<i>&gt; LOCAL GOVERNMENT........ bureaucratic, polite, and mildly responsive if you</i><br>

This is rather accurate, though the slime has seemed to ooze downhill a<br>
lot since I was a kid. When I was little, the postman who walked the<br>
route was a freindly guy, so there is one exception.<br>
<p>
I think that the reason Lyle said what he did, is that he either lives<br>
in one of those fairy land type countries, or he lives in an area where<br>
everyone is equally rude, so the rudeness of gov't employees seems<br>
rather normal. (BTW Lyle, do you live in New York?)<br>
<p>
I read an article in the paper recently on how northerners here in the<br>
US, typically from MA, NY, NJ, Chicago, and such, have an extremely hard<br>
time adjusting to the politeness and freindliness that many southerners<br>
naturally effuse. They think that if they are not being treated like<br>
shit that someone is trying to get something from them, or that they are<br>
wierd somehow.<br>
