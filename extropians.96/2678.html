Suresh Naidu said, "The government was as short sighted as can be, as usual. <br>
But the businesses are still the ones who dumped the waste."<br>
<p>
I would correct this statement, to make it more accurate.  It was *PEOPLE in <br>
the businesses* who dumped the waste.  There were certain, specific <br>
individuals who dumped that waste, and the fact that they were business owners <br>
has as much relevance as their skin or eye color to the fact that they were so <br>
unethical that they would do such a horrible thing.  These polluters are <br>
highly unethical people who HAPPEN to be business owners as well.  Being <br>
business owners didn't *cause* them to be evil polluters.  Capitalism doesn't <br>
CAUSE people to be unethical.  Yes, there are unethical people who trade in <br>
the capitalist system who ALSO do very bad things, but to decry all of <br>
capitalism and business because of the acts of a few assholes who fuck people <br>
over is as stupid and irrational as being racist because one black guy attacks <br>
you and steals your clothes.<br>
<p>
Suresh, you're over-generalizing, BIG-TIME!  You're standing in the middle of <br>
a battlefield, blowing away friend and enemy alike.  "The enemies are humans; <br>
shoot the enemies.  All humans are enemies; shoot all humans"  is the same as <br>
"The bad people who pollute and fuck people over are business people; stop <br>
them from committing their evil acts.  All business people are evil; stop all <br>
businesses."  Both are examples of very bad logic.  Yet this is exactly the <br>
logic you are using.<br>
<p>
Check your thinking; you've got a bad meme in there somewhere, trying to take <br>
over your mind.<br>
<p>
Find out what the REAL enemy is.  It's not business.  It's not even <br>
government.  There's something much deeper.  And until you understand the real <br>
sources of the world's problems, all your grand plans for society will be <br>
misguided and ineffective.<br>
