Chris Hind asks:<br>
<p>
"Why can people blatently ignore the<br>
facts when they're sitting right in front of their face?"<br>
<p>
and,<br>
<p>
"Then how do you debunk christianity?"<br>
<p>
First of all, people will see what they want to see and hear what they want to <br>
hear.  There's so much information coming through our senses and being <br>
generated internally by the brain, that it is literally impossible to pay <br>
attention to more than a small fraction of it.  So we're very selective about <br>
what we consider important information to process.  What we pay attention to <br>
is very related to our current goals; we pay attention to what we think will <br>
help us accomplish our goals, and we tend to ignore everything else.  For <br>
example, when driving a car, we tend to pay attention mostly to things which <br>
relate to our driving; other cars, the street signs, stop lights, pedestrians <br>
crossing the street, things like that.  Other details of our experience are <br>
generally down-played or ignored.  Not everyone has the goal of understanding <br>
their world and maximizing their intelligence and creativity; most have goals <br>
of having other people express approval of them and of getting done with the <br>
drudgery which they find themselves engaged in.  <br>
	So, if someone doesn't have a compelling interest in making rational sense of <br>
their world, it is very easy for them to ignore the facts that are sitting <br>
right in front of their face.  Just like it is easy for me to ignore fashion <br>
polls and god-knows-what-else is in those glamour magazines.  It's simply <br>
outside of the area of my interest.  I don't value that information, so I <br>
ignore it.<br>
	Most Christians don't value truth or rational arguments, so they will simply <br>
ignore these things, much to the chagrin of those, like us, who do.  <br>
Presenting a Christian with a rational argument, especially one which <br>
contradicts their beliefs, is almost always futile.  First, they have to value <br>
rationality and intelligence, otherwise, everything you say is just <br>
meaningless garbage to them.<br>
	Probably the best way to communicate with Christians is to speak in their <br>
language, and that means speaking as though you accepted their basic <br>
metaphysical assumptions.  As ludicrous as you may find their assumptions, you <br>
will not be able to communicate with them unless it appears to them that you <br>
have accepted their basic assumptions.  Use their own myths and metaphors, but <br>
use the ones that most closely resemble your own values.<br>
	They literally speak a different language than you do, and to communicate <br>
with them, you must translate your ideas into their language.  Yes, much is <br>
lost in the translation, but you just have to make the best of it.  Ideally, <br>
you want to get them speaking your language, the language of the rationalists, <br>
but it's not so easy to teach them, especially when they have no motivation to <br>
learn it, and if they see it as hostile to their own cherished beliefs.<br>
	Some members of my family are into the particular variety of Christianity <br>
called Mormonism.  It's often very difficult to communicate my ideas to them, <br>
but since I was raised in that belief system, I understand it very well, and I <br>
can do a pretty good job of translating my ideas into their belief systems.  I <br>
just make a mapping of concepts.  For example, I think about the God concept <br>
and what it means to them, then I find something reasonably similar in my own <br>
mind, that has the same type of meaning to me, that fulfulls a similar purpose <br>
in my own mind, and I do this with all their other concepts, making a very <br>
coherent mapping of my thinking onto their own.  This way, I can speak and <br>
sound like a Mormon, but the deeper structure of what I say will reflect my <br>
own ways of thinking.  It's the deeper structure that conveys my real meaning, <br>
not the literal interpretation of the symbols I'm using, but the way that I <br>
link the symbols together.<br>
	Each belief system is literally a different language, a different way of <br>
linking up concepts.  To really influence someone's thinking, you must have a <br>
deep understanding of their conceptual map and speak to them as though you <br>
think very similarly to them, by speaking in their own language.  Then you <br>
will better understand what changes to make to their conceptual map to lead <br>
them in the direction you want them to go.<br>
	So, how do you debunk Christianity?  You don't.  You can't.  At least not to <br>
the believers; they have no interest in processing your arguments, and your <br>
arguments are literally in a different language than they know; they don't <br>
even know how to make sense of what you are saying; to them, it's nonsense.  <br>
But you can speak their language to them and help them re-prioritize their <br>
values, so that they value increasing their intelligence *more* than they do <br>
now, and you can help them to enjoy THINKING more than they do now.  You can <br>
discuss their belief system very intently with them, but don't criticize it, <br>
or they'll just shut down.  Discuss it as though you believe it and examine it <br>
very closely with them.  Talk about various points of doctrine with them.  <br>
Just get them thinking.  Once they develop good thinking skills they will do <br>
their own debunking.<br>
	But you must work with them, not against them.  Work from the inside, as a <br>
friend, not from the outside as an attacker.  Teach them critical thinking <br>
skills, by example.  Learn to state your reasoning out loud, in terms they can <br>
understand and agree with.  Don't just state your conclusions, but lead them <br>
through the process of reasoning, so that you can provide their mind with a <br>
template that they can use.  The reasoning skills are far more important than <br>
whether you think the metaphors you are using are really bullshit when <br>
understood literally.  It's the function that's important, not the variables.  <br>
Once they know how to reason well, they will start questioning their own <br>
assumptions, and you can help them through the debunking process, but not <br>
until they're ready, not until they start doing it on their own.<br>
	Unfortanately, it doesn't seem like you've fully recovered from Christianity <br>
yourself.  You want the Christians to just accept the facts that are sitting <br>
right in front of their face, and then they will be saved! :-)  This is a very <br>
Christian attitude, the stressing of instantaneous salvation, that if you <br>
accept certain beliefs then you are saved, if not you are damned.  Christians <br>
tend to overlook personal development and focus instead on whether you're in <br>
the club or out of the club. 	What really matters is personal development, not <br>
whether you accept certain facts or not.  I think the most important thing is <br>
that people work on increasing their own intelligence, creativity and <br>
happiness; their own Extropy, regardless of their religious preference.  If <br>
their religion is stifling them, then they will move beyond it, if their true <br>
commitment is to increasing Extropy.  <br>
	The memes we must spread are the ones which influence people to become <br>
committed to increasing Extropy.  And I think that the best strategy (somewhat <br>
contrary to what I wrote previously about offending people's minds, but then I <br>
don't try to be consistent; I'm still learning, after all), is to quietly <br>
infiltrate various belief systems and insert some well-designed memes that <br>
will promote increasing Extropy.  We must attach these memes to the religion <br>
itself somehow, so that it becomes a very important part of the religion, or <br>
at least of the belief systems of the members of the religion.  Most religions <br>
I know of already have a lot of Extropian components, so it will mainly be a <br>
matter of stressing those aspects more and slightly rearranging things so that <br>
the Extropian Values are seen as very important by the members of the <br>
religion.  We should bring as little foreign material into the religion as we <br>
can, but instead work with the religion itself to transform it into something <br>
more Extropian than it already is.<br>
