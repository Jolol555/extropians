I don't think that fuzzy logic has much place with respect to mathematical<br>
theory and proofs.  It is really a computational tool for generating<br>
concrete values in a probability-driven environment.  Yes, there are areas<br>
of mathematics (Bayes anyone?) that specifically deal with these types of<br>
situations and constructs, but they are not a replacement for fundamental<br>
logic constructs.  I don't think anyone is doing "fuzzy" proofs of any<br>
mathematical theory.  The usefulness of fuzzy logic is that it gives<br>
computational methods using non-deterministic logic and values (boolean<br>
sense) in a way that allows you to extrapolate a deterministic boolean<br>
outcome.  Or, if you prefer, a probability based solution.<br>
<p>
Of course, I am not exactly an expert on this, so feel free to tear this<br>
apart ;-)<br>
