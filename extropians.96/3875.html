<p>
And then Mr Crocker proceeds to give me (and us) a lecture on values,<br>
measuring, and individualism.<br>
<p>
I will forgive the insult, since Mr. Crocker can't know that I have lived and<br>
breathed anti-statism, pro-capitalism, hierarchy of values theory, and<br>
individualism for over 30 years. Of course, he also doesn't know that I won the<br>
1959 Canadian Association of Physicist's Prize as the top graduating physics<br>
student in Canada and subsequently was a professor of Mathematics at the<br>
University of Toronto for many years.<br>
<p>
Most of what Mr Crocker says is very fundamental, true, and, I would assume,<br>
did not need to be reiterated on this list. However, there are two major points<br>
where I differ from what Mr Crocker has stated and which make my argument above<br>
not at all "mystical nonsense".<br>
<p>
1. Being alive is the irreducible primary to all other values. Without it<br>
obtaining, all others are meaningless. Therefore, it must rationally have the<br>
highest of all possible values in ones hierarchy. This implies that its value<br>
(if comparable at all - see my next point) must rationally be extremely much<br>
higher than the value of, say, going out to dinner and a movie once a week.<br>
<p>
2. I am not prepare to agree that all human values are linearly comparable. I<br>
know *my* hierarchy of values contains incomparable trees. If all human values<br>
were comparable, this would imply that everything that one values is comparable<br>
to a certain amount of money. In essence, we would all be "value whores". This<br>
is certainly *not* true of me and I believe that it is not true of *most*<br>
people, certainly of most on this list.<br>
<p>
I made no suggestion that values shouldn't be relative to the individual, a<br>
product of his/her unique perspective of reality, and completely under the<br>
individual's control. What I am attempting to do is to compel (verbally) each<br>
individual to re-consider the unique position which the value of his/her life<br>
has in his/her overall hierarchy of values and, consequently, to perhaps wish<br>
to do something which will greatly enhance his/her chances of vastly extending<br>
that life.<br>
