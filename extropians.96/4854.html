<i>&gt;Interesting concept -- to create gods.  The presumption seems to be that </i><br>
<i>&gt;it is possible for gods to exist, but they don't exist yet -- it's up to us </i><br>

<p>
I can't speak for Anders, but I see no presumption in his post that<br>
gods don't exist yet. I see only a presumption that gods can be<br>
created, and a hint that all gods that do exist have been created.<br>
The miniscule slice of history I'm familiar with shows a lot of<br>
human beings creating gods (this is my interpretation) and many<br>
more human beings serving those gods that other human beings created,<br>
but I don't know of any gods of non-human origin. If you can point<br>
me to any, it might be interesting to study them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem is, there is a non-laughing god who claims that he </i><br>
<i>&gt;already exists, and that he is the King of the Hill; and who backs up </i><br>
<i>&gt;these claims by inspiring his followers to exert a real force in the world.  </i><br>

<p>
Yes, Lyle, we know. There is also a laughing god who claims that<br>
it already exists, and that it is the King of the Hill; and who<br>
backs up these claims by inspiring its followers to exert a real<br>
force in the world. It calls itself Rock and Roll. At this stage<br>
of the game, I think I'd lay my bets that Rock and Roll is going<br>
to kick YHWH's butt.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't even be surprised if a mere subset of Rock and Roll,<br>
Hip-Hop for instance, could kick YHWH's butt. There are many many<br>
other examples of vacuous abstractions that people make idols of,<br>
listen to messages from, and use for guidance. Most of them (sex,<br>
money, power) are very old, like YHWH. Rock and Roll is a bit more<br>
interesting to me because an argument can be made that it did not<br>
exist before the mid-1950s (although of course counterarguments<br>
can be made to this).<br>
<p>
The prophecy "Rock and Roll will never die" might turn out true.<br>
I can't say I have the same estimate of YHWH's longevity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The question is whether it is possible to "create" a new god, </i><br>
<i>&gt;a more Jovial god, who can laugh at anything and get away with it -- </i><br>
<i>&gt;and who can even stand being joked about.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The operational meaning of this is:   Can such a god </i><br>
<i>&gt;inspire his followers to exert a real force in the world?  </i><br>
<p>
To both of the above: it's been done. Dionysus comes to mind,<br>
although some claim that Dionysus no longer lives. But as you<br>
yourself said once:  may the best philosophy win. Let's subject<br>
our idols to the same winnowing. I'm sure we'll have several<br>
different good ones left after we jettison the old blowhards like<br>
YHWH.<br>
