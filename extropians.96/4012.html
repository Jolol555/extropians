This post concerns time management: density measured as activities per <br>
unit of time.<br>
<p>
Currently I am studying biology (u-grad) while working part time in a <br>
lab.  Aside from guitar playing on study breaks and a few hours of <br>
relaxation on a saturday night, all I do is study and work.  I enjoy the <br>
fact that the vast majority of my time is spent learning, both in my <br>
studies and in the lab.  However, there are countless other things worthy <br>
of my time that I simply do not have time for.  <br>
<p>
What I ask of you hyper-productive transhumans out there is for some <br>
insight as to how other people maximize their activity/time density.  <br>
<p>
There was a time when I was as motivated and productive as beer bottle <br>
growing mold on a backwash-cigarette ash substrate.  I've traveled light <br>
years in a couple years, but the frontier of improvement is vast.  In my <br>
present situation, more effective studying is an ongoing project, but all <br>
of my present activities are essential (I plan to eliminate eating and <br>
sleeping as soon as its feasible to do so.  Well,  maybe veggie pizza and <br>
a nap once a month just for fun!).<br>
<p>
So what kinds of diverse approaches do you folks when making time?  I <br>
know, this question is vague.  Maybe a general response will lead to more <br>
specific inquiry.  Any personal suggestions or references to liturature <br>
will be most appreciated.<br>
<p>
Maybe this will help get things rolling: Do you find it more productive <br>
to complete one (or two...) tasks at once before moving on to the next, <br>
or do you work on a number of things concurrently?.  I suspect the latter <br>
is more efficient.<br>
<p>
Time = Life: I want more!<br>
<p>
Exovivo!<br>
