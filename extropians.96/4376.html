<i>                &gt;The social pressure caused by the people hosting the</i><br>

<p>
<p>
There is NOT a symmetrical relationship between the transparency <br>
meme and the privacy meme. Consider the 2 extremes, Brin's world and<br>
Anti-Brim's world, both are equally unlikely but it's useful to examine polar<br>
opposites when discussing ESS.<br>
<p>
In Brin's world if it is discovered that I have a secret it is assumed I<br>
have something evil to hide and I am feared, hated, and shunned. This is<br>
certainly a disadvantage, but there are compensations, shunned though I may<br>
be, I still know all about your plans and you know nothing about mine,<br>
and that is an advantage.<br>
<p>
In Anti-Brin's world if it is discovered that I do NOT have a secret, it is<br>
assumed I that I am a fool and have no chance of being financially successful,<br>
I am ridiculed and held in contempt. This is certainly a disadvantage, but<br>
the situation is made even worse because you know all about my plans and I<br>
know nothing about yours, and this is a double disadvantage.<br>
                 <br>

                  <br>
Mind control is never 100% effective in a population.<br>

<p>
<i>                &gt;A mutant genius who does see the advantages [of privacy]</i><br>
<i>                &gt;will most likely be destroyed or rendered impotent.</i><br>
                  <br>
It just keeps sounding better and better.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Do you have some black magic by which you can make use of a</i><br>
<i>                &gt;secret without revealing its existence?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
As a mater of fact I do. There are ways of putting information in a form so<br>
that it is useful to me and nobody else, or if I prefer, I can make it useful<br>
to you and me and nobody else. There are ways I can prove that I have a<br>
certain piece of secret information without giving you the slightest clue as<br>
to what that information is. There are ways of using DC nets so that you not<br>
only don't know what I'm saying you don't even know who I'm talking to.<br>
There are ways of using Steganography so you not only don't know who I'm<br>
talking to, you don't even know I'm talking.<br>
<p>
What about cameras, if I can see what you're typing cryptography does no good.<br>
<p>
Well, Brin generously granted us privacy in the bedroom and bathroom (what a<br>
swell guy) and that's all I'd need.<br>
<p>
OK, just for that you can't have privacy even there.<br>
<p>
Then I'd find the camera in my bedroom, splice into the video line, and play<br>
back a recording of me reading the Bible, saluting the flag, and generally<br>
being a good little boy. Now I can do what I want.<br>
<p>
But cameras can be very small nowadays, how will you find it?<br>
<p>
I'll just march down to Big Brother's Ministry Of Truth and ask.<br>
<p>
They'll see you splice into the line.<br>
<p>
There are far too many cameras for somebody to be watching all of them all<br>
of the time, I'll do it when nobody is watching.<br>
<p>
How will you know when nobody is watching?<br>
<p>
I'll ask.<br>
<p>
What if they make recordings?<br>
<p>
Now that I have a little privacy I'll take my time, hack into the system and<br>
alter the recording. This only has to be done one time by one person because<br>
now I'm in a position to help my friends.<br>
<p>
How will you know how to get around network security?<br>
<p>
I'll ask.<br>
<p>
What if there is a secret camera you don't know about?<br>
<p>
Then I'm in trouble, but Big Brother is in worse trouble. Think of the<br>
scandal! Big Brother, the very apostle of transparency has a secret, what<br>
other secrets does he have? How can anybody ever trust him again?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;In the current ESS I can probably gain economic advantage</i><br>
<i>                &gt;through the use of slave labor, but no one will buy my</i><br>
<i>                &gt;products or services when they find out about my business</i><br>
<i>                &gt;practices.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
People all over the world buy billions of dollars worth of goods made by<br>
slave labor in China. People make angry speeches, there is a protester or<br>
two, but it doesn't hurt sales much. Perhaps it should but before you pass<br>
judgment on the evil nature of humanity tell me, when you're flying at<br>
600 mph at 40,000 feet are you more concerned with the engineering ability of<br>
the airplane designers or their politics?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The real question is not whether a transparent society is</i><br>
<i>                &gt;possible but whether it is "better or worse." [...] In fact,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;personally, I find the whole transparency meme pretty</i><br>
<i>                &gt;abhorrent.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure why were arguing. Whether Brin's world is possible or not is an<br>
objective question, whether it would be nice or not is subjective. It<br>
nauseates me but your mileage may vary, at any rate, I worry about it about<br>
as much as I worry that gravity will reverse direction.<br>
<p>
<p>
                 But then I too am a product of current societal pressures.<br>
<p>
Yes, but what is your point? If my childhood was different or my genes were<br>
different I might be saying that Brin was a genius too, but they aren't<br>
and I'm not. Not saying he's a genius that is, I'm not sure about the mutant<br>
part.<br>
