<p>
damn right, and it's not just "plain ol' loving", what about<br>
filial duties and conflicts, jealousy, hate, platonic friendships etc<br>

Sarah Marr muses:<br>
<i>&gt; (As an aside: The whole thing seems to me to be moving towards a description</i><br>
<i>&gt; of social relations as performance, rather than static forms and functions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This seems valid, especially when one integrates this line of thought with</i><br>
<i>&gt; current thoughts on sexuality and gender as performance.)</i><br>
<p>
i feel uncomfortable with theories that try to wrap up something as<br>
complex and self-referential as human relationships into a single <br>
ideology/word/concept/meme/theory.  I'm reminded of the Japanese <br>
saying "when all you have is a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail".<br>
<p>
i value an extensive mental toolkit, and access to the artists who<br>
can break molds and allow us fresh glimpses into what it means to<br>
be human.<br>
<p>
David Musick disagrees:<br>
<i>&gt; I see in this response the idea that commerce and economics are something cold</i><br>
<i>&gt; and impersonal and that to be engaged in these activities is equivalent to</i><br>
<i>&gt; alienating oneself from others.  This is a common view of economics.  But it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a very superficial view.  </i><br>
<p>
i do not share this view, i just believe it of Economists  ;)<br>
Although Marxists say that engaging in these activities *is* alienating,<br>
especially for wage earners.<br>
<p>
David Musick goes on:<br>
<i>&gt; All forms of economics and commerce are, at</i><br>
<i>&gt; heart, agreements between people.  Generally, "commerce" and "economics"</i><br>
<i>&gt; refers to agreements to trade things or services.  Economics and commerce are</i><br>
<i>&gt; one form of agreements which people make with each other.  I don't see how</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreeing with other people alienates one from those people.  Agreeing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; having common goals generally pulls people together into closer and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; intimate relationships, in my experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I make a different interpretation of the meme, "We are all self-employed".  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, that phrase is equivalent to, "We are all responsible for our own lives".</i><br>
<i>&gt; That is the implied ideology I see in the "Self-Employed" meme.  We all have</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain resources available to us, including time, materials, talents, skills,</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge, etc.  In running the business of our lives, we must choose how we</i><br>
<i>&gt; will use our resources to achieve the desired effects in our lives.  If our</i><br>
<i>&gt; desire is to spend a lot of time with particular people whom we love very</i><br>
<i>&gt; much, then we must organize our lives in such a way that we can accomplish</i><br>
<i>&gt; that goal.  And doing this is our own business, our own form of organization.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Business" in the general sense is simply a way of organizing resources to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplish certain objectives.  Business can be a cold, impersonal thing, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; it can be a warm, loving, dynamic relationship between people.  It all depends</i><br>
<i>&gt; on how it's organized.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Being self-employed doesn't mean that you can't work together with others.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The most successful people are generally the ones who are good at working with</i><br>
<i>&gt; others cooperatively, to the mutual benefit of everyone involved.  I don't see</i><br>
<i>&gt; how this alienates people.</i><br>
<p>
OK, several things...<br>
1) you seem to totally integrated the "Human Relations as Commerce" meme.<br>
   By your definition Romantic Love is Business.<br>
2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on trade ?<br>
3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful people..."<br>
<p>
4) Re:"We are all responsible for our own lives"<br>
   are we also responsible (to some extent) for the lives of our neighbours,<br>
   children, aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped ???<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste ponders:<br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps commerce is the natural metaphor for relationships with</i><br>
<i>&gt; human beings from outside one's immediate local culture. Considering</i><br>
<i>&gt; the unsavory nature of most of the metaphors that many people in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world still resort to for their exorelationships, perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; propagating the "commerce is natural" meme would be a big step</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward.</i><br>
<p>
i'm not denying that "commerce is natural", i'm only denying that<br>
"commerce is all"<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste continues:<br>
<i>&gt; Of course, if you only hang out with fully-enlightened people, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be (possibly) a step backward. But if you only hang out with</i><br>
<i>&gt; enlightened people, then you *are* alienated from the human race.</i><br>
<i>&gt; No one is born enlightened.</i><br>
<p>
eh? what's enlightened ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Pushing the idea that your natural relationship with all the billions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of people in the world that you do not and cannot know is commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; says nothing about your relationships with the people that you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; and do know. Obviously those can be much more flexible and deeper.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you honestly wish to relate to your closest friends and relatives</i><br>
<i>&gt; only on the same terms that you could relate to a stranger from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Uruguay, then I think you're robbing yourself of opportunities for</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfying relationships with other human beings.</i><br>
<p>
yup, although i don't think of the population of Uraguay in terms of<br>
how i can make a profit from them.<br>
