IAN: No contradiction:<br>
<p>
Its internal area (a) is red. Its external area (b) is not-red.<br>
<p>
Both areas (a) and (b) are inside the area that contains all <br>
those features necessary for its identity. Surely you agree.<br>
<p>
We might call this universal area, the "Super-red-box."<br>
Its "super identity" is its individual identity. As such,<br>
all things in its (b) area alter its individual identity<br>
as it alters the identity of all things in its (b) area.<br>
<p>
Its identity -- which is its actual inside area -- is not <br>
confined to a finite region of space as physical fact -- <br>
as ID alteration by external alteration -- clearly proves <br>
and which I believe we generally agree.<br>
<p>
<p>
So I am saying that, as facts dictate, its identity is<br>
derived from the superset, its identity -- its inside <br>
area -- is not other than the Superset. This does not <br>
negate that there is this thing we observe called <br>
"subset," but is in fact the necessary structure of <br>
its individual existence. Therein lies the paradox: <br>
the individual is derived from the whole, and thus <br>
is a part of the whole as the whole is a part of <br>
the individual. That's a logical identity/unity.<br>
<p>
That's holistic identity, and it does not deny <br>
individuality. The whole defines the individual<br>
as the individual defines the whole. A logical <br>
symmetry. In total, the whole with parts <br>
defines the whole.<br>
<p>
This is not something that supports collectivism,<br>
as it always is, it need not be enforced, in fact,<br>
it shows that central planners would be redundant.<br>
The "invisible hand" is the true "central planner."<br>
The desire of each individual defines the price<br>
of a given commodity, as the price defines the <br>
individuals desire for that commodity.<br>
<p>
Holistic identity -- whole defines part, part defines <br>
whole -- is the logical structure of everything.<br>
