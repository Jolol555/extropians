The latest is actually in the biozone, though it is a jovian type<br>
planet, which could easily have earth sized moons. The jovian planets<br>
are the easiest to spot as they are the biggest and empart the most<br>
influence on their suns gravity wize. This does not mean there would be<br>
no earthlike planets, actually it makes them more likely, once you<br>
understand the process of planet formation as a function of stellar<br>
bleeding of angular velocity. If a star has got one planet, it's likely<br>
to have more....<br>
<p>
We are detecting a few smaller planets, though still not as small as<br>
earth, more like between Neptune and Earth sized. They have even<br>
detected water in liquid form on the latest discovery, which may be<br>
water on one of its moons....<br>
<p>
A few people are working on a process to detect chlorophyll....<br>
