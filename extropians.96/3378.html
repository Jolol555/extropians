There is something called the free market which is every man is out for<br>
themselves. You're making it sound like a religion? You meantioned a soul<br>
and that you are a student of the singularity as if it were a superior<br>
being. Lets not get religious about the singularity. Please! You may<br>
consider me heartless and cruel but thats life for yah! The free market is<br>
heartless and cruel and nothing can stop that so live with it. You sound<br>
like a bleeding heart liberal attempting to ease all pain and suffering on<br>
the planet. Come on, try to save the planet.<br>
