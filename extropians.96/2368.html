In reply to James Daugherty's post, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     The pharmaceutical Corporations, were unable to control Congress</i><br>
<i>&gt; which recently responded to public pressure and allowed freedom in</i><br>
<i>&gt; food supplements.  However, they are not so easily defeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; in their quest to reap cartel style profits based on "reguations".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      So, they are going to the World Government institutions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumvent our rights...</i><br>

<p>
to which James responds:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   They get higher profits for a longer period when their products</i><br>
<i>&gt;    fall under regulations.  </i><br>
<p>
They might get higher profits per unit, but the volume of sales <br>
would be much less.  What if a product (such as anabolic steroids) <br>
is taken off the market altogether?  Would you say this is a plot by the <br>
pharmaceutical companies to increase their profits?    <br>
<p>
It's not even clear that the profit per unit would be higher if vitamins <br>
were prescription drugs.  Nobody has a patent on vitamins.   Most <br>
doctors would prescribe the cheapest generic vitamins they could find.  <br>
This is exactly the kind of situation pharmaceutical companies want to <br>
avoid.   They can make a lot more money selling vitamins over the <br>
counter than they would make selling them by prescription.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    According to economics, in the absence of government enforced</i><br>
<i>&gt; cartel regulations, profits tend to approach zero over time due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition.  </i><br>
<p>
This only applies to completely fungible products, and it assumes that <br>
there is no natural barrier to entry in the industry.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Clearly, all producers, unless morally restrained, look for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretext under which to have the govt cartelize their industry, limiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition, and thereby prolonging profits.  </i><br>
<p>
All producers?  I don't think so.  Some companies make a profit by <br>
differentiating their product from others, and creating a perception of <br>
uniqueness.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is so incredible about compromising high level pubpols </i><br>
<i>&gt; and finpols with child sex, drugs, etc?  </i><br>
<p>
This in itself is not incredible.  I don't doubt that such things happen.  <br>
However, I think you overstate your case, and hurt your credibility by <br>
doing so.  I also think you try to explain too much with one principle <br>
(conspiracy), instead of considering other explanations.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you familiar at all with the results of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; 70's Congressional probes into the CIA?  MKULTRA?  </i><br>
<p>
No.  And I think this is leading us pretty far afield.  <br>
<p>
I think we should be looking in another direction for an explanation.  <br>
I think it is a matter of belief systems, not profits.  There are still <br>
quite a few doctors who *believe* (to use Rich's favorite word) that <br>
it is superstitious, immoral, WRONG to take vitamins.  I want to know <br>
where that belief comes from, and what if anything we can do about it.  <br>
<p>
I wrote  <br>
:: We are trying to find a causal explanation of the fact that certain<br>
:: products are restricted and others are sold on the open market.  I think<br>
:: the UN, Nafta, and GATT are irrelevant to this particular point.<br>
<p>
to which James replied  <br>
<i>&gt;     Now this is really total ignorance.  The whole purpose of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; World Trade Organization is to make product regulations uniform </i><br>
<i>&gt; worldwide.  </i><br>
<p>
Excuse me, but this is a non sequitur.  The WTO could just as well <br>
make a uniform world-wide rule that vitamins shall be sold over the <br>
counter.  The fact that they are trying to make uniform rules is irrelevant <br>
to the question of why they come down on that side of the issue -- <br>
and also irrelevant to the question of why vitamins are an issue at all.<br>
<p>
Why do some people take it upon themselves to restrict our access to <br>
vitamins and other health-promoting substances?  It seems absurd, but <br>
there must be a cause.  <br>
<p>
Maybe that's a sacred cow -- I always assume that there is a cause <br>
for whatever happens.  More precisely, I assume that the best way<br>
to proceed in most situations is to look for causes.  This is something <br>
that I don't think I would be willing to question.  <br>
