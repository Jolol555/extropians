          The new version of Robin Hanson's paper is great improvement <br>
          over the earlier version I read about a week ago, which <br>
          itself was interesting enough. Now it is one of the most <br>
          stimulating transhumanist documents I've read.<br>
          <br>
          Here are some more comments.<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;That is, if the expected time for some step on any</i><br>
<i>          &gt;one planet is many trillions of years, they why would it </i><br>
<i>          &gt;happen on Earth in only a few</i><br>
<i>          &gt;hundred million years? After all, and the oldest known </i><br>
<i>          &gt;stars are now 15 billion years old, our</i><br>
<i>          &gt;sun would seem to have another five billion years of life </i><br>
<i>          &gt;left, and yet the longest known</i><br>
<i>          &gt;evolutionary step (from simple to complex cells) only took </i><br>
<i>          &gt;about 1.7 billion years.</i><br>
          <br>
          1.7 billions years does not seem a remarkably short time to <br>
          me, even is this context. But this speed argument, as you <br>
          recognise, is much stronger against a position that would <br>
          place the filter somewhere later in development, say between <br>
          primitive mammals and us. <br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;Another way to explain highly improbable quick change would </i><br>
<i>          &gt;be to assume some special</i><br>
<i>          &gt;temporal window of opportunity. If, for example, our Earth </i><br>
<i>          &gt;is destined to be fried soon by a</i><br>
<i>          &gt;runaway greenhouse effect</i><br>
          <br>
          But I don't think an explanation is needed here. If this <br>
          line of reasoning were correct, and if its assumptions are <br>
          granted, then it would imply that there probably is a <br>
          temporal window of opportunity and that by now we are <br>
          creeping close to the far part of its frame. While such a <br>
          conclusion might follow form other considerations in your <br>
          article, I do not think that the figure 1.7 years gives it <br>
          significant support. For the an impending deadline would <br>
          only reduce the potential extent of the window by a small <br>
          factor. The reason is that even if no special surprise  <br>
          effect like a runaway greenhouse effect in the near future <br>
          is forthcoming, the earth will become inhabitable within a <br>
          few billion years anyway due to increase in solar activity. <br>
          So if the "highly improbable quick change" is improbably <br>
          quick relative to a window of 4 billion years (runaway <br>
          greenhouse effect), it would be not much more improbably <br>
          quick relative to a window of, say, 7 billion years. But, as <br>
          you yourself note, 1.7 billion years is not improbably quick <br>
          given that the event should happen at all during our planets <br>
          life time.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;There are also three "save stellar appearances" </i><br>
<i>          &gt;astrophysics alternatives which could explain</i><br>
<i>          &gt;why an apparently dead universe is really alive, with our </i><br>
<i>          &gt;system an isolated "zoo". </i><br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;First, large-scale engineering such as Dyson spheres and </i><br>
<i>          &gt;stellar disassembling, might be</i><br>
<i>          &gt;effectively impossible, explaining why nearby stars look so </i><br>
<i>          &gt;natural</i><br>
          <br>
          That does not sound extremely unlikely. It must be combined <br>
          with either the assumption that we live zoo, or the <br>
          assumption that large scale space travel is also practically <br>
          impossible (which looks like a slightly stronger assumption <br>
          than that large-scale engineering can't be done).<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;I personally think that most of the Great Filter is most </i><br>
<i>          &gt;likely to be explained by the steps I</i><br>
<i>          &gt;think we understand the least about: the early steps in the </i><br>
<i>          &gt;evolution of life and tool-using</i><br>
<i>          &gt;intelligence. </i><br>
          <br>
          The early steps in evolution leave room for hope. But the <br>
          evolution of tool-using intelligence happened so quickly <br>
          that the speed argument applies and indicates that that step <br>
          is not very hard.<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;And even if a one-time event did</i><br>
<i>          &gt;select for low colonisation tendencies, we would expect </i><br>
<i>          &gt;stronger tendencies to eventually be</i><br>
<i>          &gt;selected back.</i><br>
          <br>
          One must be careful, though, not too neglect the possibility <br>
          that new technologies might make a social structure <br>
          incomparably more stable than any we have seen in history; <br>
          and in a certain societies colonisation tendencies would b e <br>
          systematically suppressed.<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;My personal</i><br>
<i>          &gt;opinion is that we should have the least confidence in our </i><br>
<i>          &gt;estimates of the first steps in</i><br>
<i>          &gt;evolving life, and so these are more likely to be large </i><br>
<i>          &gt;sources of the Great Filter than, for</i><br>
<i>          &gt;example, apparently unlikely social theories. Mars life or </i><br>
<i>          &gt;dark matter evidence could</i><br>
<i>          &gt;dramatically change this situation, however.</i><br>
          <br>
          I don't directly disagree with this, but it seems to me that <br>
          you might have slightly too much confidence in the ability <br>
          of the social sciences to tell us what would happen under <br>
          conditions radically different from anything that has <br>
          occurred so far. With &gt;AI and direct access to our <br>
          motivation centres, the psychological mechanisms behind <br>
          sociological phenomena would be totally novel; and we should <br>
          not simply assume that a social theory that appears unlikely <br>
          under present conditions could not be a plausible candidate <br>
          for describing a posthuman society (similar arguments have <br>
          been made by Wiik, Anders, David Pearce and others). Each <br>
          sociological principle that is to be transferred from now to <br>
          then requires special justification.<br>
