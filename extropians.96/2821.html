Mike's post reminds me of the distinction is between particular emotions<br>
and "emotion" in general.<br>
<p>
I think talking about emotions in general, the *facility* of emotion,<br>
the emotional aspect of mind, as vestigial, is wrong.  Sometimes people<br>
talk about emotions as if they were interfering outside influences, and<br>
that amounts to the same thing.  Not recognizing them as parts of<br>
oneself.<br>
<p>
To me it's like talk of "surgical" warfare.  I'm afraid that<br>
people who use clinical terms to talk about something violent...are on<br>
the wrong side of the war.  The jargon of "self-enhancement" can be<br>
used in this way, often unconsciously; but any talk of oneself as an<br>
object to be manipulated must be coming from some *part* of the self<br>
considering itself *above* the rest--such a part must be misspoken at<br>
best, misinformed, misguided, insensitive, inhumane, or even evil.<br>
<p>
*Particular* emotions can be considered "vestigial".  I have a whole<br>
flock of emotions that I consider nasty enemies, things to be<br>
controlled, managed, etc., although in some sense they may have things<br>
to tell me.  But also I realize that "me" is just one side in a war of<br>
some emotions against others, or even emotions turned against themselves<br>
in the dark.<br>
<p>
I don't begrudge anyone a metaphor that helps them to cope.  The danger<br>
is letting the old-fashioned false mind/body-dualistic way of talking<br>
trick you into an undeclared war on your own best self.<br>
