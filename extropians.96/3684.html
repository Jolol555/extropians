Hal,  the number of people in the room has nothing to do with the chances of <br>
the dice rolling double sixes any more than the number of atoms which are in <br>
one of my eyelashes.  The roll of the (fair) dice is entirely independent of <br>
the number of people in the room that the dice are rolled in.  At any time <br>
when the dice are rolled, the chances of them both coming up sixes is 1/36.<br>
<p>
In your scenario, where ten times as many people are brought into the room <br>
each time double sixes aren't rolled, there is a 1/36 (.0278) chance that 100% <br>
of the people will witness double sixes (if the first person is rolled double <br>
sixes), a 35/1296 (.0270) chance that 90.09% of the people will witness double <br>
sixes (if they are rolled for the second group), a 1225/46656 (.0263) that <br>
90.09% (it's slightly less than the last amount, but it's approaching 90% as <br>
the number of (increasingly unlikely) trials which take place increases) of <br>
the people will observe double sixes, and so forth.<br>
<p>
No matter when you're in the room to witness the roll of the dice, the chances <br>
of the particular even of the (fair) rolled dice both coming up sixes will <br>
always be 1/36.  You make a link in your mind to the significance of the dice <br>
coming up sixes and the rolling sessions ending, and you reason that since <br>
approximately 90% of the people will observe this "significant" event, the <br>
chances of the significant event occuring during any particular dice roll must <br>
be 90%.  Perhaps you will realize the flaw in your thinking if I point out <br>
that the dice themselves are blithely unaware of your organizational schemes <br>
and will roll just as randomly as always.<br>
<p>
This is very related to the "midpoint of history" flaw, which I can't believe <br>
any reasonable person would buy into.  Why couldn't we be at the beginning of <br>
things?  Someone had to be!  The dice rolling idea above and the "midpoint of <br>
history" idea remind me of someone rolling  1000 dice, which are lined up in a <br>
row and declaring that a miracle had occurred because the chances of the dice <br>
coming up with that *particular* sequence of numbers is 1/6^1000 (almost <br>
zero), yet it was rolled on the first try! <br>
<p>
Hal, you also said, "My personal opinion is that a random person in the room <br>
actually would see the dice roll as sixes, and that if I found myself in the <br>
room I would bet on the double sixes if someone offered me this option.  What <br>
do you think?"<br>
<p>
What do I think?  I think I'll take you up on that bet!  We'll run the <br>
experiment and if the dice come up double sixes when you are in the room, then <br>
you win, if it doesn't, then I win.  Since you believe you have a 90% chance <br>
of the dice coming up double sixes and I only have a 10% chance of winning, <br>
it's only fair that the bet is made according to those odds (for example:  if <br>
you win, I pay you ten dollars, but if I win, you pay me ninety dollars).  Is <br>
it a deal?<br>
