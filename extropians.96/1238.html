Ian, what _are_ you talking about? I'm not saying it's separate from its<br>
external area, merely that it's internal area is part of the superset. It's<br>
external area is _not_, as you claim, the entire superset. How can it be? If<br>
the area of the subset were not part of the superset it would not be a subset!<br>

<i>&gt;  &gt;all that the box is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IAN: Just as this thing &gt; * &lt; has no identity apart from its external </i><br>
<i>&gt;area, the red box has no identity apart from its external area. Therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt;its external area is * inside * the area that contains all those features</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary for its identity. I've just unified the red box to the universe </i><br>
<i>&gt;that you errantly assume you've removed it from.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Furthermore, the red box is "big," "small," "common," "rare," "bright,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;"dark," .... only relative to other items its external area.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While you've not identified a single feature of the red box that </i><br>
<i>&gt;is derived exclusively from its internal area. I've presented many </i><br>
<i>&gt;examples of externally derived features. Can you find even a single </i><br>
<i>&gt;feature of the red box that is derived free from external relation ? </i><br>
<i>&gt;If not, how do you sustain your claim to nonrelational identity ?</i><br>
&lt;and snipped stuff&gt;<br>
<p>
I _do_ wish you'd pay attention to what I'm saying, and not then start<br>
accusing me of disagreeing with the very thing I _do_ agree with. I agree<br>
with everything you've said above (although size brings up interesting<br>
questions).<br>
<p>
But the following sentence is a _complete_ nonsense:<br>
<p>
"But all that it is, is all that its not."<br>
<p>
OK: it's red. So apply that sentence:<br>
<p>
"It is red. It is not red."<br>
<p>
OK: it's small. So apply that sentence:<br>
<p>
"It is small. It is not small."<br>
<p>
And so on.<br>
<p>
Your theory is fine, and I hate to be so blunt, but it's just that you use<br>
mathematical and grammatical structures to try and desribe it which entirely<br>
fail to do so from any logical or semantic perspective.<br>
