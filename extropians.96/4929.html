John, thank you for the citations.<br>

I think it is HCN absorbate on silica. HCN itself would have been much <br>
too dangerous (18 deg C b.p.), its solution in water is instable.<br>

I have seen these holes in the ceiling in Dachau btw., though they didn't <br>
gass people there -- the installation was too new. And the average <br>
village Kraut _really_ didn't knew -- the first time they saw <br>
concentration campers was towards the end of the war, where advanced <br>
Allies fronts caused them to hurry up with the coverups -- marching <br>
columns in full daylight, shooting sick/exhausted people in the field.<br>

Right, but it is also the chiefest advantage of HCN: after a day treated <br>
terrain is passable. This doesn't happen with VX. Btw, anybody knows what <br>
this Russian VX successor is, the one one order of magnitude better than VX?<br>
<p>

<p>
Apart from the other nasties, the effects of HCN are briefly treated in <br>
"A Higher Form of Killing" by Robert Harris and Jeremy Paxman, 1982.<br>
