<i>&gt; Yes it's a hypothesis, from radar data. Illumination is only starlight,</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; linear induction accelerators for putting lunar resources into orbit,</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Yes! yes! Good, old linear motors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't see there being a need for a large population on the Moon. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't take many people to load dirt into accelerator buckets. There isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; much worth mining, and you'll need to import a lot of raw materials (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; water reserve isn't large, and you would still probably have to import</i><br>
<i>&gt; nitrogen).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In his L5 days, Eric Drexler wrote an essay in print that spoke to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; asteroid vs. moon development debate in the National Space Society (I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; it might have been in one of those Pournelle fiction/non-fiction space books</i><br>
<i>&gt; in paperback format). It convinced me that the Moon isn't good for much, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we should be planning for the near-earth asteroids instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've found it hard to get excited about the concept of moon colonies since</i><br>
<i>&gt; then. It/they will look like mine sites in Northern Canada, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; dozens/hundreds of people at most, but no long-term prospect for development.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been to northern minesites. No matter how well set-up they are, no one</i><br>
<i>&gt; who wants to live there. They have a heavy crew rotation schedule (in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case of the moon, to L5?).</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but with 1/6th G, you can build HUGE domes! Imagine multiple domes,<br>
each the size of Seattle. Just the retirement possibilities alone are<br>
stupendous. Since old folks tend to be a bit set in their ways,<br>
adjusting to lunar gravity would be a far bit easier than any asteroid,<br>
while still offering the ability to operate in earthlike ways.<br>
<p>
The big difference between lunar colonies and say northern Canadian<br>
mines is that it will still be more expensive to shuttle people around,<br>
and since the resources come from there, your management and support<br>
infrastructures will be permanently assigned, so they will start it, and<br>
as they have kids, the population will expand.<br>
<p>
In any case, if people get pissed at seeing the moon lit up like the<br>
Texaco Sign over Fenway Park, wait till we start projecting holograms<br>
into earths upper atmosphere! That will be for more targeted advertizing<br>
in local areas....<br>
