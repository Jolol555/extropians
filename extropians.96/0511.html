<i>&gt;.... However, there may be a period during which we're very</i><br>
<i>&gt;much in the same space. That's the period in which humans could be at risk</i><br>

<i>&gt;robotics. AI's in that case would not be roaming around much physically, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;they could exist in distributed form in the same computer networks that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;use for all kinds of functions crucial to us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If they need us for doing things physically, we would still have a strong</i><br>
<i>&gt;position. Nevertheless, powerful SI's in the computer networks, could exert</i><br>
<i>&gt;massive extortionary power, if they were so inclined. So I still think it</i><br>
<i>&gt;important that SI researchers pay attention to issues of what values and</i><br>
<i>&gt;motivations are built into SIs.</i><br>

I think you attribute too much to values and too little to social<br>
institutions.  The reason the U.S. is not usually at war with Mexico<br>
has little to do with how much we each personally value the lives of<br>
Mexicans.  Similarly the reason we tall folks have not slaughtered all<br>
you short folks has little to do with how much we like you.<br>
<p>
Rather, these phenomena are mostly due to social institutions and<br>
dependencies - the fact that nations deter via military strength, that<br>
laws deter crime within a nation, and that we all need each other in<br>
various ways.  <br>
<p>
I think we have little to fear from AIs who are not enslaved, and who<br>
are integrated into the rest of our social institutions.  I.e., owing<br>
property, being allied with different nations and corporations, etc.<br>
<p>
You of course do have something to fear from AIs who can do you job<br>
better than you, and are willing to do it for less.<br>
