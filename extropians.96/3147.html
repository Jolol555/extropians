&lt;&lt; Why, food and shelter, of course!  All evidence suggests (to my<br>
 overly rational self, at least) that all human goals are just<br>
 subgoals of our self-preserving and reproductive urges.  Even<br>
 the more cerebral ones like scientific inquiry fall under this<br>
 category---knowledge is power. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I guess you don't subscribe to Maslow's hierarchy of human needs where<br>
philosophical fulfillment is highest or Stephen Covey's human<br>
happiness/fulfillment requirements of Live, Love, Learn, Legacy.  <br>
<p>
Food and shelter (basic living) are needed first (even by a post-human?) but<br>
after that goal is reached, there has got to be more.  I think leaving a<br>
legacy where ever I go is more fulfilling than finding food and shelter.  <br>
<p>
I don't agree the goals:  "more cerebral ones like scientific inquiry", are<br>
linked to such reptilian desires as food and shelter.   Maslow started with<br>
five needs then added two more later, as he developed his understanding of<br>
human nature.  I don't think I can say what a post-human's needs for<br>
fulfillment will be, but it must be higher that what Maslow, Covey and I have<br>
already found.<br>
