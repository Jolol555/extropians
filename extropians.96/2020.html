Up until a disk crash last weekend that has caused the loss of my mail<br>
archive at least for the time being I would have been able to reconstruct the<br>
dialogue we had some months ago about "rights".  (I recall it was going on<br>
right before the list changed platforms ...)  I recall the dialogue had as<br>
focii the "rights" of sub- and super-human entities, Ian's discussion of<br>
rights and claims and others' commentary about the _recognition_ of claims by<br>
others.  Reference to the previous discussion is not made with intent to say<br>
this is completely covered ground for previous subscribers, but I wonder if<br>
anyone could unearth any of the posts from that earlier dialogue: Many of the<br>
core values that make up the commonality that is "extropiansim" implicate<br>
concepts of "rights".  Discussion of this concept will inevitably come up<br>
again and again.  Perhaps someday we should attempt a manifesto: "The Rights<br>
of Post-Man"?<br>
