But there's the rub, David. The difference between intellectual and<br>
emotional offense is often slight, and that difference is subjective.<br>
Furthermore:<br>
<p>
(1) The sort of people who recognize the difference, and treat your comments<br>
as an intellectual challenge are exactly the sort of people who don't need<br>
to be offended: they would recognize a sound intellectual argument anyway,<br>
consider its content and reinterpret their own position accordingly.<br>
<p>
(2) The remaining people will misinterpret your comments and react<br>
emotionally, defeating your purpose, and making further argument difficult,<br>
if not impossible.<br>
<p>
So what's the point of creating offense? In (1) it's unnecessary and in (2)<br>
it's counterproductive.<br>
<p>
Now, it may be that there's a (3): a small group who are intellectually<br>
offended by what you say. But I believe that to be a small group, all of<br>
whom could eventually be persuaded by clear, inoffensive argument.<br>
<p>
Even if (3) is true I still hold that the collateral damage produced would<br>
outway the worth of the few positively influenced.<br>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps 'intellectual enigma' might be a better approach: drive people's<br>
thought processes and interest by providing just enough information to get<br>
them interested, then reel them in with the answers to the questions they<br>
have already begun to ask themselves. Certainly it's worked for me in the past.<br>
