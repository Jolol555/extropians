<i>&gt;&gt;Ummm, nope. I'm only acting this way because I don't see anybody doing</i><br>
anything! Do something and I'll calm down.<br>
<p>
Some how I think you missed the point.<br>
Calming you down is not a priority of mine. Nor anyone else who objects to<br>
your idea of your "media attack".<br>
<i>&gt;From that comment it is even MORE obvious you still havent done that</i><br>
"homework" I suggested. <br>
FYI - There are definitely people "doing".<br>
You simply haven't bothered to find out what or who.<br>
I wasn't attacking you Chris. I merely state that you are new. This "lack"<br>
you percieve in others, without first looking into the reality of Extropians<br>
you barely know, exposes that you don't research and think before you speak.<br>
<p>
Now come on,  sit back, relax, close your mouth and listen. You might learn<br>
something.<br>
