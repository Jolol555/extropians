<i>&gt;There are many possibilities here.  First, we don't even know that Salinger</i><br>
<i>&gt;was telling the truth when he attributed the document to a "secret service</i><br>
<i>&gt;agent."  If we are going to question almost the entire U.S. government</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which is OK), we should also be able to question Pierre Salinger (even</i><br>
<i>&gt;more OK).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does anyone besides me see a possible motivation for Pierre Salinger?</i><br>
<i>&gt;There he is living in left-wing France -- an enlightened country just</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to keep foreign words from polluting their language.  A number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;French citizens were killed in the crash.  But so far, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;satisfactory explanation of what caused the crash.  People don't like</i><br>
<i>&gt;living with such uncertainty.  Pierre Salinger comes along and blames it on</i><br>
<i>&gt;those nasty, foreign imperialists.  Pierre Salinger becomes a national hero</i><br>
<i>&gt;in France.  Many paid speaking engagements result.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I wish I could prove it, but alas, I cannot. &lt;g&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This is not at all improbable.  The last few years the US has been involved<br>
in a full-scale intelligence war with France.  Contrary to what most people<br>
would think, France is considered to be the number one enemy of the US,<br>
intelligence-wise.  After a couple recent serious embarrassments the CIA has<br>
caused France (such as the GATT incident and the Brazil incident), it<br>
wouldn't surprise me if they took this opportunity to even the score.  When<br>
I was working for DoD, the US was purportedly deporting something like 300<br>
French spies per year.<br>
<p>
I would prefer to wait for the final autopsy of the wreckage.  <br>
