How close have we come to creating the "Meal in a Pill" portrayed in old<br>
scifi? This idea came to me tonight when I was discussing it with my father<br>
who thought perhaps a cereal company was blocking it from the marketplace.<br>
But he agreed, the meal in a pill idea would be adopted by many people, he<br>
and I included. I don't know about the rest of you, but I would definately<br>
enjoy popping a pill and saving all the time of eating a meal. To me it<br>
sounds like a step towards uploading where eating food would be exclusively<br>
for pleasure.<br>
