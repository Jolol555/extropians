You can't learn how to ride a bicycle by reading a book, but you certainly<br>
can learn about the habits of birds of prey from a book.  In fact, there<br>
would be little if any human progress if everything had to be learned<br>
through direct experience.<br>

Winston Churchill was a genius.  He was, in fact, living proof that a<br>
person could know more through reading and reasoned analysis than all those<br>
who relied on "direct experience."  Mr. Chamberlain relied on experiential<br>
learning and believed Hitler was a man of peace.  After all, Hitler told<br>
him so to his face.  Churchill was a student of written history and knew<br>
better.<br>
<p>
Isn't the net a great thing?  Anyone can diagnose Churchill's "weakness" in<br>
front of hundreds of people scattered around the world.  And others can<br>
reply just as fast...<br>
