        NEW YORK -- Nobody knows for certain what life will be like when  <br>
humans make outer space an integral part of their natural habitat. But <br>
informed speculation is a valuable tool as we move toward this <br>
evolutionary step, and it's hard to imagine a more vivid forum for <br>
such guesswork than IMAX 3-D, which fills a gigantic movie screen with <br>
images 10 times larger than those on conventional film. <br>
        The latest movie using this process, ``L5: First City in Space,'' <br>
 <br>
tells the story of Chieko, a likable youngster who has lived all of <br>
her seven years in an outer-space community populated by her parents <br>
and about 10,000 other adventurous people. Gravity comes from the <br>
rotation of the huge, wheel-shaped structure. Power comes from solar <br>
radiation and a fusion-based power plant. Hydroponic farming provides <br>
food, and raw materials are mined from an asteroid the community <br>
``captured'' for that purpose. <br>
        Focusing mainly on the quality of life in this well-designed  <br>
environment, ``L5'' doesn't have much of a story until Chieko's <br>
grandfather - the city's senior scientist - realizes that crucial <br>
life-support systems have been stretched as far as possible, and a <br>
crisis will occur unless a new water supply is found. <br>
        His solution is to lasso a nearby comet, diverting its orbit so  <br>
that L5 can extract needed materials as it passes by. The plan is <br>
almost ruined when a robotic probe misfires, but Chieko's father saves <br>
the day by rocketing to the comet and setting things straight. Chieko <br>
herself narrates the adventure, looking back on it from her adult <br>
perspective as L5's mayor. <br>
        ``L5'' is only 35 minutes long, about the maximum allowed by  <br>
current IMAX 3-D technology. Putting its emphasis on entertainment <br>
value, it offers more spectacle than substance, blending NASA imagery <br>
and computer-generated effects with studio scenes involving Chieko and <br>
her family. In keeping with today's political atmosphere, its social <br>
views are a mix of the conservative (individual gumption is all we <br>
need to solve common problems) and the liberal (our shared humanity <br>
should override national interests and racial divisions). <br>
        Supervised by Toni Myers with assistance from Allan Kroeker, who  <br>
directed the live-action material, ``L5'' is now opening in theaters <br>
equipped for the Imax 3-D system. For sheer sensory impact, it's as <br>
big and bold as anything on screen this season.<br>
