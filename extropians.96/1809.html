                  <br>
<p>
Why not develop intelligence the same way the earth did, after all, we know <br>
for sure it works. We can in principle simulate anything perfectly, in <br>
practice however, when we try to do this for anything except perhaps a <br>
Hydrogen atom, we are stopped by the computational complexity of Quantum <br>
Mechanics. Obviously this is no problem for an infinite computer, in fact, <br>
although some things would still be impossible, if a task was possible then <br>
it would be easy, nothing would be hard.   <br>
           <br>
Simulate an atom then a molecule then an ocean. We know approximately what <br>
the conditions were like on the early earth, but maybe a very specific  <br>
initial condition is needed for life to evolve. This is no obstacle for an  <br>
infinite computer, just simulate all possible conditions, it's is a VERY <br>
large number but no closer to being infinite than the number 1 is, it will<br>
take 0 seconds to do it. Maybe most paths do not lead life to intelligence, <br>
but we know of at least one that does, and our computer will find it with no <br>
trouble and probably many more. What if I'm not a very good programmer and <br>
only got a C in Quantum Mechanics? No problem, just keep changing things and<br>
diddling around, eventually ( correction, instantly!) you will get everything <br>
right and things will start to evolve.  0 seconds after that, your simulated <br>
life forms will make a major scientific discovery, they will find a way to <br>
make a computer that is infinitely fast, now their machine is as fast as <br>
yours, and then ...<br>
    <br>
Unfortunately I don't expect to see an infinitely fast computer this side of  <br>
The Omega Point, but you can do a lot even if it's just astronomically fast. <br>
Drexler calculated the amount of computer power needed to simulate ALL the <br>
brains that have ever existed before humanity, that is, all the brains since <br>
brains were invented in the Cambrian Explosion 570 million years ago. <br>
He concluded that about 10^38 machine instructions would do the trick.  <br>
A Nanotechnology computer the size of a large present day factory and using  <br>
no more power, could perform 10^38 machine instructions in about 2 years. <br>
