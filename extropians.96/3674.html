As is entropy, by the way.  But mainly: of course it's observer-dependent.<br>
The point is not to default to being a non-observer, a non-valuer.<br>

<p>
It isn't really necessary to what I was saying, which was a point about<br>
the term "non-human."  Most people, non-extropians included, would agree<br>
that a person could lose a lot of things and still be human.  But if<br>
someone uses the term "non-human," it means missing something essential--<br>
to the speaker at least.  I think the opinion poll could be reduced to<br>
two questions:<br>
   1) Do you think there's a core or essence to "humanity?"<br>
   2) Is it a bad thing for someone to lose their "humanity?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a danger in trying to press a heterogenous (an understatement)</i><br>
<i>&gt;bunch of people under the outward spiraling banner of Extropy.</i><br>
<p>
And I wouldn't want to.  What I meant was, if "extropy" means anything to<br>
me at all, it's the idea of actively pushing for a better future--which<br>
requires getting over apologizing for one's particular values--rather than<br>
passively accepting whatever happens, or trying to join the winning team<br>
by philosophizing in its favor.  People actually slip into a little<br>
gung-ho fatalism on this list sometimes: if the XX are coming and we can't<br>
beat 'em, then join em.  Well, not so fast, boys.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...]There is a tendency here to use labeling as threat</i><br>
<i>&gt;of exclusion:  "You are not Extropian. You do not belong to us. You have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;think thus &amp; thus to call yourself Extropian".</i><br>
<p>
No, my kind of exclusion is this: if I personally don't like the way<br>
someone thinks, if their idea of progress runs too much counter to what<br>
I consider progress, then I don't like their way of thinking.  It's<br>
"entropic" by my lights, whether other "extropians" agree or not.<br>
<p>

<p>
Thanks for the tip but maybe you can help me figure out how I expressed<br>
myself so poorly the previous try.<br>
<p>
(Also, thanks for Cc-ing to me--it'll be a week before I'm that caught up<br>
reading the list!)<br>
