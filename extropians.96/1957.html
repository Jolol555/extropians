I'm not sure that I can imagine a contract totally bereft of any reference to<br>
property, since the capacity to enter into contracts seems to presume a level<br>
of (self-)control sufficient to support (self-)ownership.  That is, unless<br>
the contracting parties can make good on their promises, they will of<br>
necessity breach their agreements.  Further, if the power to execute promises<br>
does not generally vest in (or through) the contracting parties, the notion<br>
of contract lacks sense.<br>
<p>
(My parenthetical hedges mean to reflect the possibility that contracting<br>
parties may in fact act only as agents for principals who, in fact, own and<br>
control the agents.  This seems like a rather absurd possibility with regard<br>
to basic self-ownership, but keep in mind that Locke vested in God at least a<br>
majority interest in the titles to humans.)<br>
