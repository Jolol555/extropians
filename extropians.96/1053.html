Here goes<br>
FUN! FOOD! HOT TUB! CONVERSATION! DANCING! BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE! MOVIES! AMAZING<br>
PERFECT HOST GEROME!!!<br>
<p>
The first thing I saw after climbing up the steep  stone stairway( in the<br>
darK) was natasha vita more dancing ( well, i could only see  a lot of hair<br>
and a very fit figure sort of thrashing wild yet graceful to the Techno-<br>
Ambient music- but I knew it was her anyway- . There was an enormous redwood<br>
 deck with Extropians of many shapes and sizes lounging around on  every<br>
imaginable form of suspended chair. There was a hot tub, with ( naked)<br>
Extropians in it and even and outdoor shower ( I was impressed ) - shielded<br>
from everything, studded with oaks and redwood trees and on a hill up above a<br>
ravine, the place called "freeland' was a large and very nicely outfitted two<br>
story  house.  I lurked, more or less, met some really interesting folks, and<br>
enjoyed the feeling of total freedom and relaxation  - and had a great time! <br>
      The conversations were laid back - and went on late late into the<br>
night, not too heavy just interesting and social...not a lot of hashing over<br>
stuff- just enjoying each other..... and in the morning there was a great,<br>
food oriented, coffee drenched, 'round the table ' discussion of everything<br>
and nothing ( sound familiar?) followed by a movie called Harrison Bergerac<br>
(spelling?) which was hysterically funny and sad as well... <br>
Rent it  if you havent seen it.   Cleaning up was the last thing we did<br>
before we drove back to LA - back to the busy lives.... <br>
<p>
<p>
(a side note) Some folks had driven as far as New Orleans, and No Carolina -<br>
i had the pleaseure of having Steve from No. carolina  visit us in L.A. for a<br>
few days..  Extropians exist even in the APPALACHIAN HILLS! ( go figure..<br>
 those memes spread far and wide, indeed!  SO there he is in that backwoods<br>
area, reading Drexler, Vinge, Churchland  and Moravec - he was so happy to<br>
have people to finally talk to, can you imagine??.)<br>
I didnt get there til nighttime - so someone else has a different more<br>
complete meta- take on it, i am sure- but it was a great, relaxed,  and<br>
flavorful evening, with great libertarian symbolic freedom and a lot of<br>
terrific people altogether.... <br>
And once again  that  Gerome was the perfect host, no kidding....<br>
