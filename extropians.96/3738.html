In this case of course, you are assuming all of humanity, having the same<br>
level of openmindedness and understanding towards other peoples<br>
thoughts/actions, which are now considered 'private', as you yourself may<br>
have. Not regarding some of them as 'deviant' or ethically judging them in<br>
any way. In sharing all of ones thoughts and memory of actions with people<br>
who are this open minded, i do see an increase in productivity and<br>
effectiveness of human interaction. The point is that someone open minded to<br>
(what is considered to be) ALL of humanities 'deviant' or 'morally dubious'<br>
behaviour, will be hard to come by. <br>
<p>
As a matter of fact, most humans will have at least some ethic, or morality,<br>
by which they 'judge' other people, instead of just themselves. Until this<br>
changes, i see your assumedly intended goal of making everyones thoughts<br>
available to everyone, as being more counterproductive than todays<br>
situation. People today  communicate their 'private' thoughts and actions,<br>
with individuals from who they expect will have that open mindedness on a<br>
specific level, and from who they expect communicating these to them, will<br>
bring benefit (in whatever form). IMO, a very rational and productive system. <br>
<p>
Another point is, that people in general show a tendency to 'react' to<br>
knowledge of another individuals thoughts, (considered private or not) when<br>
they either share those thoughts enthousiastically or disagree with that<br>
same level of 'enthousiasm'. Under the current situation, sharing your<br>
'private' thoughts and actions, would bring productivity increase by<br>
communication with that small percentage(or promilage, etc) of humanity,<br>
which agrees with you, some productivity increase by communicating with<br>
those that are able to constructively criticise, but counterproductivity, by<br>
those stuck in their dogmas, who will just condemn you for whatever they<br>
will disagree with. And ofcourse that 99.9999 etc % of humanity will just<br>
ignore you like they always have... <br>
<p>
Choosing which ideas to share with which individuals, requires insight in<br>
those other individuals. Whereas i basically agree that more 'open'<br>
communication can lead to an increase in productivity, i still believe that<br>
this insight will remain a strong factor in just how efficient that increase<br>
will be.             <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     In all my dealings with others, I try to be as open and revealing of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;inner most thoughts as possible. I reject totally the idea that "white lies"</i><br>
<i>&gt;are OK. Furthermore, I have stated many times that my desire to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communuicate with fidelity what I am is so great (and I seem not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish this by standard interpersonal methods), that I would very much</i><br>
<i>&gt;welcome a human augmentation which would allow us all to transmit and receive</i><br>
<i>&gt;each others thoughts. I have stated that if such an augmentation were possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally better</i><br>
<i>&gt;world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever they</i><br>
<i>&gt;liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<p>
Have you considered other consequenses of what you suggest ? Some<br>
individuals have a greater 'quality' of manipulating other individuals,<br>
privacy of thought, protects us from eachother in this. Children would get<br>
away with doing things, by being able to candidly read the minds of their<br>
parents and teachers , who may sympathise with the child, but need to 'lie',<br>
or try their best to be 'tough' on them in the childs best interests. The<br>
same could go to some extent, for those individuals in society who hold a<br>
higher responsability, and have acchieved higher levels of education,<br>
experience and insight, towards individuals who haven't. Like the child may<br>
not be able to see the parents 'reason', individuals may not see eachothers<br>
'reason' wether based on intellectual differences, or cultural differences.<br>
Or do you suggest we become a homogenous population of equal intellectual<br>
and cultural 'values' ?<br>
<p>
Every society creates a set of rules to live by. Private thoughts and<br>
actions also serve in those cases where the individual assumes his<br>
responsability in 'breaking' those rules in order to adapt them to his<br>
personal 'reason' (the politician, but also the criminal). A 'reason' other<br>
individuals may not understand.     <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;My basic point here is to question the rationality of anyone valuing privacy.</i><br>
<p>
IMO, privacy serves the individuality of people. Your idea is very noble,<br>
but the reality is that your 'altruism' may not be the same as someone elses<br>
altruism. Someone may think you are 'abusing' his candedness, where you are<br>
not thinking the same, and vice versa. <br>
<p>
Another way of looking at things: do you want to know all thoughts, and<br>
memory of actions of other individuals ? Being able to selectively choose,<br>
is also part of what makes us an individual...<br>
<p>
<p>
thanks for bringing up an interesting point.<br>
