    ATLANTA, Dec. 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamonds from pencil lead?  No problem<br>
if<br>
"molecular manufacturing" and "nanotechnology" become reality as Ralph Merkle<br>
expects.  He's an exploratory engineer bringing science and engineering<br>
together at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center.) Merkle's a nanotechnology<br>
pioneer and guest on "The Paula Gordon Show," Sunday, December 15, at<br>
9:04 a.m. on WQXI/790AM.<br>
          Merkle and others working at Xerox PARC specialize in finding<br>
practical<br>
applications for high-end science. (Computer "icons" people now take for<br>
granted were invented there.) Merkle takes a pragmatic approach to the<br>
possibility of nanotechnology -- since it appears molecular manufacturing can<br>
happen, it will happen.  Tools will be created to allow us to manufacture<br>
with<br>
nature's basic building blocks -- atoms and molecules.  That would<br>
dramatically reduce cost while radically increasing precision and<br>
flexibility.<br>
The possibilities for benefit or harm are enormous.  Merkle is an optimist.<br>
          "Nanotechnology overcomes the physical limits of current<br>
technology.  It<br>
could vastly enhance the human condition, lead to global abundance.  Imagine<br>
if we could eliminate world hunger by growing perfect food in precisely<br>
regulated green houses.  Or eliminate pollution.  Today's manufacturing<br>
technologies are crude -- it's as if we were trying to assemble Lego blocks<br>
while wearing boxing gloves.  If we could manipulate atoms and molecules,<br>
we'd<br>
finally be able to take the boxing gloves off."<br>
          There are profound implications to this proposed advance in human<br>
technology.  The Foresight Institute (www.foresight.org) is one organization<br>
watching the nanotechnology work of scientists and engineers around the<br>
world.<br>
          "Right now, all manufacturing is very crude at the molecular level.<br>
 With<br>
nanotechnology, we have the potential to put every atom in the right place.<br>
We will finally have the ability truly to manipulate our physical<br>
environment.<br>
It's a monumental shift.  The public needs to play an active part in it,"<br>
said<br>
Merkle.<br>
          In 1959, Nobel Laureate physicist Richard Feynman suggested<br>
molecular<br>
manufacturing was possible.  Now an entire discipline exists.  Is this<br>
physics<br>
or is this chemistry?  "Yes," grinned Merkle.<br>
          "Nanotechnology will allow us to make incredibly small things with<br>
great<br>
efficiency, cheaply.  We'll be able to create the materials necessary to take<br>
us to the stars," predicted Merkle.<br>
          "The Paula Gordon Show" originates in Atlanta.  Beginning January<br>
4, 1997,<br>
The Show moves to Saturday afternoons, 3 to 4 p.m. on 50,000 watt<br>
