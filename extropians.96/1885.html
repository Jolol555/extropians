<i>&gt;                 &gt;is a good example of capitalism running amuck. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                       </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their </i><br>
<i>&gt; children less than we do? The reason they send their young children to work </i><br>
<i>&gt; in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and death, you've </i><br>
<i>&gt; said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to </i><br>
<i>&gt; stop this child labor, the thing that let's them survive, and that doesn't  </i><br>
<i>&gt; seem like a very smart thing to do, and it CERTAINLY doesn't seem very  </i><br>
<i>&gt; humane.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Only about 6 or 7 percent of the people on this planet have what you or I  </i><br>
<i>&gt; would consider an acceptable standard of living, at most one in a thousand  </i><br>
<i>&gt; lives in a way we would envy, most people live in appalling poverty. </i><br>
<i>&gt; No matter how you divide up the pie, the average person is going to be living </i><br>
<i>&gt; in intolerable conditions until we get a bigger pie. The Free Market is very  </i><br>
<i>&gt; good at creating wealth, if History has taught us anything it is that  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Socialism is not. You have virtually admitted as much in your posts, that's </i><br>
<i>&gt; why you don't want to let me do my Capitalist thing, but I have no fear of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; you doing your  Socialist thing. We both know how such a contest will end up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
                      <br>
Capitalism is better at centralizing wealth. The thing is, capitalism <br>
doesn't CREATE wealth any better than any other system, that will always be done through <br>
ingenuity and innovation and better resource gathering methods. In our <br>
blessed capitalism, we have enormous waste on one side, while the other <br>
side isn't doing quite as well. There is plenty in the pie for all. The <br>
problem in the world is not lack of wealth, it's waste of wealth. All the <br>
resources that go into making a sonic toothbrush that is only cared for <br>
by people with money to burn are resources that could be better put to <br>
use. We also have severe food waste problems here, like McDonalds , while <br>
people are starving. We may have to adopt a more environmentally friendly <br>
lifestyle, but that's what technology helps us do, but we wouldn't have <br>
to scale down the standard of living. Everybody can have the same access <br>
to wealth. The people in the Third World have more of a power imbalance <br>
than a food shortage.  Why is the alternative worse? That's the question. <br>
Libertarians say that everybody can make choices, but doesn't take into <br>
account that some people have choices that suck more than others.   <br>
<p>
Same thing in the soviet union. Created plenty of wealth, but wasted it in a system that was very <br>
bureaucractic and elitist.     <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;I see something immoral in keeping a section of populace as                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;cheap reserve labour for our needs. Like those Pocahontas                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;shirts made in Haiti by  women paid seven cents an hour </i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would it be more moral to fire 99 workers and pay the remaining one 7$ an </i><br>
<i>&gt; hour, or fire 999 workers and pay the remaining one 70$ an hour? Yes I know, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I should pay 1000 workers 70$ an hour, but I simply wouldn't have the money to </i><br>
<i>&gt; do that because nobody would buy my shirts because nobody could afford them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                              </i><br>
<i>&gt; You seem to think you would be doing the Haitian people a great favor if you  </i><br>
<i>&gt; could get me to junk my entire Haitian operation and fire everybody. Stop </i><br>
<i>&gt; theorizing and ask the workers involved if they think you're their friend, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but do it over the phone not in person, I'm afraid they'd try to lynch you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<p>
No, because in the free market, that's the only way they can eke out a <br>
living. Like I said, everybody has choices, just some have choices which <br>
suck. Why can't they start a union? Because they'll all be fired. The <br>
alternative, starvation. Why? <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Putting up electric fences and hoarding resources with                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;superior firepower is not accepted by most people. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you are looking for a workable system in which force is never used, you  </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be looking in vain forever. The best we can hope for is to minimize it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
So you think Libertarism will minimize force? The foundation of the <br>
system is that people should be willing to use force to defend their <br>
property. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;I am looking into starting a software co-op  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think software is a good candidate to a co-op. While the difference  </i><br>
<i>&gt; between a good programmer and a poor one is no greater than in other fields, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the difference between a good programmer and a great one is huge. To these </i><br>
<i>&gt; prodigies your co-op will not look very attractive and you'll be stuck with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of mediocre people; but give it a try, I could be wrong, the more </i><br>
<i>&gt; experimentation the better I say.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I'm afraid of that. But there are so many brilliant programmers <br>
here at UW that just will not work for a company on a full time basis. <br>
They hang around the CSC and watch Anime, because they don't want to start <br>
a business, and everything else sucks. So they hack Linux kernals for <br>
fun...In my software job, I only get to write objects for other <br>
programs (this could be because I'm only frosh). Many programmers resent <br>
that, and like to write entire programs for themselves. By coordinating <br>
themselves, they have a lot more freedom. Top-notch programmers might <br>
like not being told what to do. I really have no <br>
idea. But I think we'll start by writing some good software for Xwindows.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Answering a question of who determines need: In small scale                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;operations [...] Co-ops don't work well on a large scale </i><br>
<i>&gt;                       </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then why are we talking about them? You're writing about changing the social </i><br>
<i>&gt; structure of the world, nothing "small scale" about that.</i><br>
<p>
When I mean scale, I mean size. A huge corporation is large scale, a <br>
small business is not. A coop is egalitarian, so it is hard to coordinate <br>
activities around the world, because everybody gets a say. Since <br>
descisions are made to be as close to consensus as possible, it is not as <br>
time-efficient, but that doesn't matter, because if everybody owns the <br>
business, they will do whatever it takes to make it better. However, the <br>
first priority is making sure eveyone has a say, not profits.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;it's quite easy to spot who's not carrying their fair share                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;or is hoarding too much </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again we have the "quite easy", perhaps it's easy on Planet Suresh but not  </i><br>
<i>&gt; on Planet Earth. "Hoarding" by its nature is a secretive activity, you can </i><br>
<i>&gt; only tell I'm doing it if you're smarter than I am, and you're certainly not </i><br>
<i>&gt; smarter than everyone. Perhaps I do work less than you, but that may be </i><br>
<i>&gt; because I'm smarter than you and work more efficiently. Do you really want to </i><br>
<i>&gt; discourage initiative and productivity? There is nothing "quite easy" about </i><br>
<i>&gt; all this, you'll need to have your thought police monitoring me every second.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
No, but everybody, I guess, is a Thought Police, because when you screw us, <br>
we want to know. It takes a lot to screw  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;and to have a chat with them. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chatting may not be enough. When you tell people that the house they have </i><br>
<i>&gt; built with their own two hands is too good for them and you have come to  </i><br>
<i>&gt; confiscate it, I fear they will tell you to do things that may not be </i><br>
<i>&gt; anatomically possible. To be obeyed you're going to need an army, and a  </i><br>
<i>&gt; big one.</i><br>
<p>
Why would you do that? If a person builds an energy efficient house without <br>
taking too much resources from everybody else, we'll be the first to <br>
applaud. We won't confiscate it, in fact, if it's a great house, <br>
then we'll all pitch in and help everyone get a good house too. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;                         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If you don't like it, leave the commune. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                     </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Excellent! Fine! You don't have to tell me twice! I am out of here!   </i><br>
<i>&gt;                        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;This is made easier because there is no tie to property.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe not in the commune but I'm out of that hell hole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If one commune screws up, the people can leave and go their                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;individual ways.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And my "individual way" is Capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
So your way involves fencing off territory that belongs to everybody. So <br>
you are a thief, and are thus infringing on our rights <br>
in the commune. Of course, if you don't hurt anybody, <br>
then squatters rights are respected. You can live on territory and be <br>
self-sufficient, but you can't overfish, poach, start forest fires, and <br>
enslave people. If the commune finds out your doing this, they'll get <br>
angry. Hell hath no fury like an anarcho-syndicalist commune scorned.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now you're going backward. I'm not bothering you, why not let me do my thing </i><br>
<i>&gt; and you do yours? Just order your subjects not to have any dealings with me,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps they'll obey freely, and if not you always have the Thought Police.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; As long as I'm not living in your commune what do you care what I do?  This </i><br>
<i>&gt; is exactly the asymmetry in our positions I was talking about.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, so you can enslave the people in your business, preach to them <br>
about the evils of "those commie scum" and keep them in such a state of <br>
fear that they'll work for whatever you feel nice enough to give <br>
(crumbs). You can do your thing, but so can everybody else. In order for <br>
that to happen, they'll have the same property rights as you. Unless you <br>
do something benevolent to make the "rabble" respect your property <br>
rights, they'll get pissed off and come tearing at your doors. Nobody has <br>
any control over anybody else, so even that rabble would be doing it <br>
because each member is pissed, not because some demagogue is whipping <br>
them up. It's just extended democracy.<br>
