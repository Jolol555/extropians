A quick search through my saved Extropian list collection doesn't find a<br>
mention of "Ghost in the Shell."<br>
<p>
"Ghost in the Shell" is a Japanese animated movie which has been making a<br>
run in American theaters recently.  If it comes to your town, SEE IT.<br>
<p>
It is very well made,<br>
it is real science fiction, although in an action movie format<br>
   (well, action with lots of intense dialog including some<br>
    philosophical and evolutionary pondering)<br>
it is a movie for people who can think,<br>
it is a Very Extropian Movie,<br>
it includes a really funny/apt visual pun/metaphor featuring the Tree of Life,<br>
it's kool.<br>
<p>
A "ghost" in this movie is, loosely, a person's consciousness or personality.<br>
The something-or-other that makes someone a person, whether it's still in<br>
their biological brain or is in a computer at the moment.  The<br>
available technologies aren't all explained, more taken for granted, but<br>
we know that some people have computers as well as brains in their heads.<br>
A clarifying example is someone whose memories have been maliciously<br>
hacked so badly that the person "no longer has a ghost."<br>
<p>
A "shell" is a body.<br>
<p>
If you're in the Boston area I've got a copy of the video.  But I<br>
definitely recommend seeing it in a movie theater.  On video you spend<br>
more time going "what's that?...oh," and miss things at the fast pace.<br>
The bandwidth was a definite plus for this movie.  It was nice to have<br>
a movie showing me things for once instead of me wanting to give<br>
the director a piece of *my* mind...er, so to speak.<br>
