Has anyone mentioned (or read) the novel _The Truth Machine_ by James L.<br>
Halpern?  It's quite a suspence thriller.<br>
<p>
"The year is 2006 and most Americans have lost faith in their jury system.<br>
The government is urging industry to create a machine that can always tell<br>
when a person is lying.  Few people realize that this Truth Machine is<br>
destined to become the most important invention in history. Soon its use<br>
will spread from courtroom to politics, to diplomacy, business, sicence,<br>
education and finally into every home - gradually reshaping the very nature<br>
of humanity."<br>
<p>
"This ground breaking thriller is like a jounry into tomorrow's world. . .<br>
spans six decades, and every astounding new technology it describes is<br>
scientifically possible."<br>
