Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What would economists call the type of mechanisms (for trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;modulate chaotic systems, rather than eliminate them) </i><br>
<p>
Economists don't focus much on systems described by differential<br>
equations in time.  So they don't have a snappy name for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I fail to follow the reasoning behind that whole Hanson-Bishop</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussion that aliens would likely have a "kill them and eat them"</i><br>
<i>&gt;attitude rather than a "study them and trade with them" approach.</i><br>
<p>
Some people try to explain why the universe looks dead by saying there<br>
are lots of folks out there, but they are all hiding for fear of being<br>
attacked by others.  The point of our discussion is to analyze if this<br>
is a plausible and self-consistent scenario.  We are not advocating it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the impression that such a civilization would need an almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;totalitarian control of its members in order to "hit and run" and avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt;detection (low profile scenario), OR just to maintain its momentum and</i><br>
<i>&gt;keep everyone committed to the 'pave it over', bigger-is-better strategy</i><br>
<i>&gt;even if some might prefer to drop out and become independent agrarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet huggers.  </i><br>
<p>
While central control might be needed to keep people quiet, little is<br>
lost by letting people drop out of the expansion quest at will.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By "pre-programmed" I was thinking that such a civilization would</i><br>
<i>&gt;require a strict constitution and would use only approved designs in</i><br>
<i>&gt;order to be 'optimal', rather than let market mechanisms, technology and</i><br>
<i>&gt;cultural modes continue to evolve spontaneously.  </i><br>
<p>
Central control seems far more likely to perpetuate worse designs, so<br>
allowing diversity seems a clear winning approach to expansion.<br>
