"We are not Markov chains because we have memory AND we can plan ahead.<br>
In other words, in addition to accidents and active seeking of<br>
alternatives, we also are able to apply past states (experience) to<br>
current situations. The teleology of being nostalgic and goal-directed<br>
violates the first-order Markovian property of finite-state systems."<br>
<p>
A deterministic computer can also have memory (it can retain information which <br>
are processed as being information which should be kept, just like we do (we <br>
don't remember everything, only those memories which are successful enough to <br>
maintain themselves in our brain environment; most memories are pieced <br>
together from very fragmentary information in a way that makes sense to us), <br>
and it can plan ahead by anticipating the probability of future events based <br>
on whatever type of algorithims it has been programmed with or has evolved.  <br>
Having these abilities doesn't somehow, magically transform the deterministic <br>
computer into a non-deterministic computer.  And us having these abilities <br>
doesn't magically transform us into non-Markov chains.  Markov chains can <br>
exibhit memory and planning.  These are simply types of algorithms; they are <br>
not magical processes.  They are poorly understood processes, but that is no <br>
reason to invoke miracles to explain them.  I see no reason to invoke any sort <br>
of "life force" or "soul" to explain ourselves; these are simply ways of <br>
avoiding further analysis.  If there is a "life force", what are its <br>
properties?  I say, the properties of self-copying, self-maintaining chemical <br>
reactions.  What are the qualities of our "souls"?  Only the qualities arising <br>
from the activities in the brain.  This false dichotomy, between the mind and <br>
matter is one of the things that really bothers me.  This stubborn desire for <br>
the magical.  <br>
<p>
We, our minds and everything about us are part of the natural world, the <br>
physical world.  There is no need to propose any sort of super-natural realm <br>
to explain anything.  And, in fact, proposing the super-natural is simply a <br>
way of *avoiding* explanation.  It may in fact be that the universe is not a <br>
Markov chain, and it may also be that we are not Markov chains, but I think <br>
that our ability to remember and to plan are silly reasons to suppose that we <br>
are not Markov chains, since Markov chains can have the same abilities.  <br>
Humans seem to have the irrational urge to think that somehow they escape the <br>
laws of nature which everything else follows.  So they propose the fantasies <br>
of God and soul and then complacently think that they are saved by some <br>
magical being instead of saving themselves through their own efforts, through <br>
technology.<br>
