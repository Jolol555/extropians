What if the key sequence of mutations developed in a prokaryote that gave<br>
rise to what is now the eukaryotic cell-plasm, but that various descendants<br>
of this "swallower" prokaryote then adopted a large number of different<br>
prokaryotes as proto-nuclei? Is it possible that multiple independent<br>
origins (perhaps thousands or millions, once the essential "swallowing"<br>
mutations had developed) could account for the observed variation in<br>
eukaryotic rRNAs?<br>
<p>
Note that amoebas seem to be capable of sustaining new digestion-resistant<br>
prokaryotic parasites within their cell-plasms even now, so multiple<br>
independent eukaryotic origins doesn't seem too implausible to me.<br>
<p>
If the idea of multiple independent origins is correct, then I think we'd<br>
*expect* to see as much variation among eukaryotes as we see among<br>
prokaryotes, even if the eukaryotes have only existed for a much shorter<br>
time, because eukaryotic genes would arise from a broad sampling of<br>
prokaryotic genes.<br>
<p>
This stuff is on the edge of my ability to think about intelligibly, so<br>
please pardon me if I made any really heinous mistakes.<br>
