<i>&gt;Or a Johnny Mnemonic type dolphin with cybernetic implants to enable them </i><br>
<i>&gt;to communicate with us more effectively. Then we could have dolphins on </i><br>
<i>&gt;the WWW, learning and growing far faster than we did at our early stages </i><br>
<i>&gt;of evolution. </i><br>
<p>
Whoa! Dolphins wired to the web. Cool. I wonder what special mental<br>
processes they could evolve to add to our pool of knowledge. We *ARE*<br>
Gaia's brain (to go along w/the analogy) and what you're suggesting is that<br>
we should wire all animal brain's to the global internet brain to speed up<br>
evolution of all the animals. A bit odd but cool. The shared global sum of<br>
Earth's knowledge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Do you understand what I am saying?  It's very difficult to communicate</i><br>
these<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ideas well.  Especially since I don't know how much background you have in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; these areas, and I don't know how much to explain and how much to assume</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; already know.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You erroneously assume that every human has as much trouble</i><br>
<i>&gt;communicating their thoughts as you do. This has more to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;education than evolution.</i><br>
<p>
No one can know the entire english vocabulary and there are emotions still<br>
undefined by english so no one can communicate in the least amount of words<br>
and time possible unless you're uploaded and have thousands of years to<br>
restructure your sentences.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Humans DO have a low level of communication.  Most of the activities and </i><br>
<i>&gt;thoughts occurring in our brains have no representation in our languages.</i><br>
We <br>
<i>&gt;can look at the sky, but can we communicate the color blue?  No; we can only </i><br>
<i>&gt;refer the person we are talking to, to their experience of the color blue.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;When we're communicating with each other, we're basically referring each</i><br>
other <br>
<i>&gt;to common, similar memories and experiences.  We can only really communicate </i><br>
<i>&gt;about common experiences and concepts.</i><br>
<p>
Our current language is like how computers across the internet talk to each<br>
other via TCP/IP when we use a completely different language to think. I<br>
think that we will migrate toward a more visual-based language such as<br>
highly detailed stories but created quickly with tools to relay alot of<br>
information to another individual.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, it is extremely difficult for us to communicate with each other about </i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences we have in common but which haven't been talked about before, so </i><br>
<i>&gt;no symbols have been developed yet to represent that common experience.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Various bodily sensations and nuances of emotion are common, mutual </i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences for which we haven't yet developed symbols, and so we cannot </i><br>
<i>&gt;really communicate with each other about these experiences, because we don't </i><br>
<i>&gt;know what sounds or images to make to get the other person to remember the </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience we are wanting to refer them to.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps we need to become a closer more open society with people openly<br>
sharing their ideas. This could be encouraged though dynamic optimism being<br>
taught in preschools.<br>
