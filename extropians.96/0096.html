Here's my latest trick for this one. It vaguely and metaphorically<br>
resembles a mathematical generalization over possible values.<br>
<p>
Aristotle distinguished between extrinsic values and intrinsic values. He<br>
thought intrinsic values were better because extrinsic values "partake of<br>
drudgery". What bothered me about this is all the "higher values" like<br>
truth and justice usually turn out to be generalizably extrinsic. Living<br>
according to the "higher values" turns out to be useful in getting all<br>
sorts of petty little personal preferences accomplished, and flouting the<br>
"higher values" tends to screw you over.<br>
<p>
And even though the quest for increasingly excellent scientific theories<br>
turns out to be extremely generalizably extrinsic, those who contribute to<br>
that quest hardly think of their activity as "drudgery". Usually it's<br>
something that they come to value intrinsically as well, especially the<br>
best of them.<br>
<p>
Anyway (sorry about the laborious background): let's say there's something<br>
you want, x, doesn't matter what it is. Now in general, for any possible<br>
goal x, a better understanding of your environment will help you attain it.<br>
Harmonious (and profitable!) interactions with your fellows will usually<br>
help you attain it. (Minsky discusses this kind of thing in the "Functional<br>
Autonomy" section of SOM.) There is a  small nonpermissible subset of<br>
possible goals x for which this is not true (e. g. a desire to go around<br>
randomly chopping off people's heads), and cooking up a demarcation of that<br>
nonpermissible subset is a matter for further research. (This is the<br>
problem of "natural law"... the marked-off subset of non-permissible goals<br>
include things like murder and plunder.)<br>
<p>
But there are many extrinsic subgoals that generalize very nicely across an<br>
extremely broad set of permissible end-goals (the intrinsic ones). So if I<br>
whimsically decide to constrain my goals to accord to natural law (I decide<br>
I'm not interested in killing and plundering), then no matter what my<br>
idiosyncratic goals are within the remaining goal-universe, I can serve<br>
those ends indirectly by working towards increasing my understanding of the<br>
world and increasing the harmony of my relationships with others (take<br>
harmony in a strictly market sense, *if* you like, with profit as its<br>
measure... there are other interpretations).<br>
<p>
So, given the "natural law" constraints, I don't even have to know much<br>
about  the particular identities of my idiosyncratic tastes and intrinsic<br>
goals to know how I can serve them in the long run, to know what I ought to<br>
do. (This is the theory, but see my remark at the end of this post.)<br>
<p>
Why does the "natural law" mark off the non-permissible goals? Because<br>
those goals are generalizably disextrinsic... they tend to work against the<br>
attainment of any of the much larger set of possible goals not forbidden by<br>
the "natural law". But the problem of making the demarcation precise is<br>
still a hard one, though some good work has been done recently (e. g.<br>
Gauthier).<br>
<p>
The demarcation problem is also, for me, closely related to the foundations<br>
of libertarian political theory. If there's going to be a government, it<br>
should only prohibit a minimal set of "bad" things, and mandate practically<br>
nothing. The demarcation of law (or what the law should ideally be) from<br>
morality, and of morality from taste, is very important to me for this<br>
reason. Law should be a lot less pluralistic than morality, and morality<br>
should be a lot less pluralistic than taste. But all of these things are<br>
values.<br>
<p>
Making all this precise? Well, maybe I'll expand this into a thesis<br>
someday, if I don't get sidetracked by some other interesting problem.<br>
<p>
And before anyone leaps in, I already know that in theorizing about human<br>
values, more than in any other theoretical domain, we must be very careful<br>
not to confuse the map with the territory. These are just theories, or<br>
rather analogies that point in a direction in which a theory might be<br>
developed. I'll be happy if I can someday improve on Kant and Gauthier.<br>
There will always be room for further refinements.<br>
