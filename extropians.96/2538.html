IAN: Political candidates do not necessarily get votes from <br>
the majority. But, that's not a case against democracy.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Do you think the majority of people want to pay for sonic toothbrushes?</i><br>
<i> &gt; Only the rich do. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: That's what they once said about regular toothbrushes. Because<br>
those people didn't stop laissez-faire capitalism then, now even the <br>
"poor" can afford toothbrushes. If we don't stop capitalism now, <br>
the same thing will happen again.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; You have more ballots than most people. If you become rich enough, it</i><br>
<i> &gt; doesn't matter what other people think, you can impose your will on them. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: If people share your fear, nobody will get that many votes.<br>
They can only "impose their will" once they start to buy up all the <br>
land.  Buying off and then growing the govt is the logical course <br>
to take, and the most effective pretext for growth is socialism.<br>
So the logical course is anti-socailism, or laissez faire.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; That's what I think will happen with unrestrained capitalism. You will</i><br>
<i> &gt; either get an [1] dictatorial oligarchy with more money than everybody</i><br>
<i> &gt; else, or you willget a traditional [2] Marxist revolution type thing. I   </i><br>
<i> &gt; don't like either ofthose things.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Your saying that capitalism will lead to either [1] socialism<br>
or [2] socialism so we would be better off with socialism.<br>
<p>
The fact is that both varieties of socialism you fear -- both <br>
rule by a central cabal -- are achieved only by means antithetical <br>
to capitalism, so there is a clear path: laissez faire.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Going back through the posts I think it was you who dropped off the</i><br>
<i> &gt; argument.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Your argument that no central planner is needed because people <br>
will "keep tabs on each other" was the last point I saw you make. <br>
It could work only in one small community where each person <br>
could visually inspect the wealth of their neighbors, and <br>
hold them to task for any evidence of more wealth than average. <br>
<p>
I explained several other reasons why this is untenable and<br>
am not aware of your counter to those points.  Since it <br>
seems you are, you could forward it to me if you like.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Why is an utopia illogical? </i><br>
<p>
IAN: If its goal -- equalization of wealth -- violate it's <br>
tenants -- liberty -- as in the case of "anarcho-socialism,"<br>
then it's illogical.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I'm advocating voluntary socialism, pretty much. No I can't</i><br>
<i> &gt; impose this by force, because that's just not right. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: So you disagree with Chomsky when we says we need the federal govt?<br>
