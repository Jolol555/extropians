<p>
Too me, the Singularity stuff is kind of an easy way out.  Its like an<br>
excuse not to do anything because "the Singularity will do it".  Whether<br>
Singularity happens or not, we should act as though Singularity will never<br>
happen, if only to get things done.  I personally am doubtful about<br>
Singularity anyway, so it doesn't really impact my predictions or decisions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for work, I am curious about how many subscribers to this list</i><br>
<i>&gt;are involved in any of the various free software projects such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;GNU, Linux, or the Debian distribution packaging project. Lately</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have come to a realization that the success of Unix over other</i><br>
<i>&gt;programming environments (and here I'm talking about success with</i><br>
<i>&gt;programmers, not success with users) is a consequence of the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it was designed to evolve in a way that constructivist-rationalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating systems such as Windows NT were not. I would not be at</i><br>
<i>&gt;all surprised if the future evolution of free Unixen is intricately</i><br>
<i>&gt;intertwined with other future technological developments, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;though I know all about the shortcomings of Unix (it's not all that</i><br>
<i>&gt;hot at realtime stuff, the main process forking mechanism is</i><br>
<i>&gt;inefficient, the security model puts too much demand on skilled</i><br>
<i>&gt;system administration, etc), but this is where my own interest has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been taking me lately. I am particularly interested in the various</i><br>
<i>&gt;attempts to transmogrify Unix into a distributed operating system</i><br>
<i>&gt;(such as Plan 9, its offspring, and Gnu's HURD).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What Debian is doing for the evolution of computer software seems to </i><br>
<i>&gt;me to be something roughly analogous to Cairns-Smith's hypothesized</i><br>
<i>&gt;cutover from clay crystals to DNA molecules. The Debian project is</i><br>
<i>&gt;coming up with a standardized system of interchange of "genetic"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(memetic, really) information between computer systems, so that</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating-system modules can be exchanged and improved fairly easily.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately, intellectual property restrictions impede this process,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but fortunately, intellectual property restrictions are strictly</i><br>
<i>&gt;optional.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Opinions? Comments?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I've been working on free Linux software off and on.  I think the free and<br>
open system encourages the rapid evolution of the software and OS.  And<br>
quite frankly, it runs rings around my Sparcstation, in both speed and<br>
flexibility.  In my case, I have been working on a free, large-scale<br>
relational database system for Linux.  Something equivalent in both power<br>
and flexibility to Oracle Workgroup Server 7.3, while being more closely<br>
integrated with Internet technologies than the Oracle servers.  I have<br>
looked at extending the Linux OS to something of a native distributed<br>
request broker architecture, mostly for my own amusement.<br>
<p>
I cannot wait for the day when free Unix goes head to head with The Big Guys.  <br>
<p>
But this is getting a little off-topic...<br>
