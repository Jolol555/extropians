Well, it has appeared in several variations on the list (and the <br>
transhuman list) over the years. It is probably one of the perennials. <br>
<p>
Have you read _The Time Ships_ by Baxter by any chance? He discusses this <br>
scenario in the book, in the final part of the book. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; QUESTION</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does the scenario hold and what is the reason then for us as biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings to go to space and live eternal lives? (Not counting the obvious</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to fight the robots for raw materials ;-) )</i><br>
<p>
First of all, it is unlikely that AI transcendence will occur overnight <br>
surprising humanity (I know some on this list disagree with me on this), <br>
so it is likely that some precautions will be taken (such as preventing <br>
the AIs from running off with replicators). This is the AI-slavery <br>
question, and might be sticky ethical ground.<br>
<p>
My view is that this scenario is possible, but not necessarily the only <br>
possibility. I often argue for what could be seen as the robot scenario <br>
with humans as hangers-on: by developing AI based on human-computer <br>
symbiosis, we ensure that we will remain important parts of any spreading <br>
AI civilization (just as mitochondria and brainstems are part of us; <br>
primitive but essential). This way we could both get our infinite lives, <br>
space and freedom for the robots, since they would be us. <br>
