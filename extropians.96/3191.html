On the Fortune magazine web site there is an article dated December 9, 1996<br>
and entitled "What It's Really Like to Be Marc Andreessen"<br>
by Rick Tetzeli and reporter associate Shaifali Puri<br>
<a href="http://pathfinder.com/@@rFqKFgYAmks5Cgzj/fortune/1996/961209/and.html">http://pathfinder.com/@@rFqKFgYAmks5Cgzj/fortune/1996/961209/and.html</a><br>
<p>
The article provides some insight into Marc Andreessen's viewpoint about<br>
nanotechnology. Note, Andreessen is now worth more than 100 million and<br>
potentially could fund research into nanotechnology. Specifically, the<br>
article claims:<br>
<p>
   Andreessen has sold at least 500,000 Netscape shares worth $28 million.<br>
   He still has 1.5 million shares, worth $82 million, in which he is 60%<br>
   vested.<br>
<p>
The last sentence of the article which is quoted below is interesting I<br>
think.<br>
<p>
Begin excerpt from Fortune article:<br>
<p>
But Andreessen is more focused on two other time frames: the here and now,<br>
and the way far out. What's next is an open question. <br>
<p>
As for the way far out, he has plenty to say about it. One of his favorite<br>
novels is The Diamond Age, by Neal Stephenson. Its plot is built around<br>
nanotechnology, the science of manipulating individual atoms to build<br>
devices and circuits. Although nanotechnology is being taken more and more<br>
seriously, its possibilities seem positively chimerical. At its extreme,<br>
nanotechnology would allow us to create stuff--anything from a chair to a<br>
blimp--out of practically nothing. "So many of the things people do are<br>
going to be unnecessary when matter can be rearranged arbitrarily," says<br>
Andreessen. "I mean, this gets into all kinds of bizarre stuff.<br>
Immortality. There's no fundamental reason why the breakdown of cell<br>
structures is inevitable." <br>
<p>
He pauses to sip some iced tea, waiting to see if I've heard correctly.<br>
"There's no reason..." I begin. <br>
<p>
"There's no reason death should happen," he rushes on. "There's no reason<br>
decay shouldn't be totally repairable. There's no reason you shouldn't be<br>
able to design exactly the body you want." <br>
<p>
"Well," I say, "there's no reason I should be unhappy." <br>
<p>
"That raises a very philosophical question," he says. He seems exhausted, or<br>
perhaps disappointed by my skepticism. He slows down for a second.  "Well,<br>
at the very least the concept of manufacturing goes away." <br>
<p>
It's one of those asides that make hanging out with Andreessen so<br>
interesting. But it also makes you wonder if this guy's too far out, too<br>
undisciplined, too young to keep Netscape in the big time. It makes you<br>
wonder if he can play in the same league as Gates. <br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
The article ends with the following two paragraphs.<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
As for Gates, well, Andreessen isn't sure the man in Seattle has a clear<br>
sense of the road ahead. "Microsoft is doing things that are not rational<br>
for a company in a leadership position," he says. "They define their culture<br>
as one where they deliberately try to destroy competitors as their primary<br>
way of doing business. The generally accepted strategy for a market leader<br>
is to grow the market, not to wipe out the remaining 10%. It may take years,<br>
but fundamentally their strategy is flawed." <br>
<p>
By then, Andreessen figures he may have other options. "You know," he says,<br>
"within 30 years someone's going to make a shitload of money in nanotech." <br>
