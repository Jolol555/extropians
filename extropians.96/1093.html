IAN: Based on the 100+ witness and radar reports, someone shot the <br>
plane down with a missile. They must have used a fairly large and <br>
powerful missile requiring a fairly large ocean vessel to launch it. <br>
How does the suggestion that the Navy may have fired this missile in <br>
any way seem equivalent to "anti-gravity experiments"? The suggestion <br>
that there is such an equivalence, seems to me to be the only thing<br>
resembling an "anti-gravity experiment."<br>
<p>
Adding to the missile reports the fact that early reports said the <br>
Navy was conducting maneuvers near the crash, on what factual or logical<br>
basis have you totally junked the Navy missile theory ?  I'd like to know, <br>
so that I too can discard this theory as you have. I've not seen any<br>
rational basis stated by the FBI regarding their dismissal of this.<br>
