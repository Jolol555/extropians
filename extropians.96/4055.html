<i>&gt; &gt;        But, do feelings and emotions not have a logical and reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;basis?  Are they not designed to direct us towards goals?  Procreation?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Self-preservation?  Attainment of wealth?  I maintain that emotions ARE</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;designed logically, just designed generally on an unconscious level hence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;we are sometimes unable to see the reasoning behind them.</i><br>
<p>
Something to help clear this up:<br>
Our minds run on a goal-based architecture.  That fact isn't as<br>
objective as quarks, but it is true.  Various goals are manufactured and<br>
maintained by evolution.  Others are transmitted culturally and<br>
ultimately ground in those same goals manufactured by evolution.  Our<br>
cognitive architectures give goals two values of "justification" and<br>
"value".  Query:  Given a cognitive architecture which operates through<br>
Power-perfect reasoning and does not give an a priori value to any goal,<br>
will it ever correctly produce a goal with a positive value?<br>
<p>
Answer:  It will produce at least one Interim goal of a positive value: <br>
Finding out what the Ultimate goal is.  Presupposing that there exists a<br>
goal of positive value, other goals may be viewed as subgoals to this<br>
unknown goal.  Finding out what the Ultimate goal is is one such<br>
subgoal.  Thus the system will produce an "Interim Meaning of Life" with<br>
positive value:  "Find out what the Meaning of Life is."<br>
<p>
A non-Interim Meaning of Life can be defined as a positive-value goal,<br>
produced by a clean system, which does not have any hypotheticals in the<br>
recursive "justification" network.  Because the cognitive architecture<br>
starts with a clean slate, the system as a whole is self-justifying;<br>
that is, the network produced by following the "justification" slots of<br>
the Meaning makes no outside references and yet produces a goal with<br>
positive value.<br>
<p>
Tada!  A complete definition of the Meaning of Life which<br>
relies on nothing more than a grasp of Doug Lenat's twenty-year-old<br>
Automated Mathematician's architecture.<br>
