<p>
Possibly. But there is a larger problem: we learn about methods to cure <br>
rarer and rarer conditions. These cures are expensive, and since the <br>
conditions are rare, their prices will not sink as fast as for cures <br>
against (say) acne. I'm not 100% sure if this leads to a total increase <br>
in cost, but it definitely seems so. Add to this other reasons for <br>
increasing medical costs, and we have a nasty problem. <br>
<p>
In _Tech Heaven_, Nagata mentions a move where some medical therapies are<br>
deemed too expensive to subsidy, and hence become unavailable to most<br>
people - in the name of giving at least everybody a chance to get *some*<br>
decent medical help. <br>
<p>
To get around this costs have to be lowered: either by drastic <br>
improvements of technology (unlikely to work on these short spans) or <br>
changes in the way medicine is financed. Interesting material for an <br>
independent thread. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Techniques for manufacturing new designs of computing hardware that can</i><br>
<i>&gt; instantiate neural and fuzzy computational processes are developing *much*</i><br>
<i>&gt; more rapidly than our understanding of the brain.</i><br>
<p>
Let's see now: Moore's Law: processor power doubles every 18 months. <br>
Medical knowledge doubles every 5 years. Yes, you seem to be right. <br>
(although knowledge about the brain grows faster than most areas, thanks <br>
to recent insights). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;1) I doubt it will be neural nets, more likely we will see coupling of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   brittle computer algebra packages (Mathematica, MatLab, etc.) first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   bioNN computational prowess is pretty awesome -- we'll need some time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   to approach this order of magnitude. Complementary skills.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I suspect we'll need an understanding of the computational processes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the brain before we can start hooking any *new* functionality into it, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; once we have that understanding, we'll probably use it to build some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; new functionality. Granted that this understanding is nowhere in sight at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the moment.</i><br>
<p>
If we can create some way to interface at all, we can start hook in <br>
functionality. The interface will just be very messy and non-intuitive, <br>
unless we can hook up signals to the normal I/O systems (sight, hearing, <br>
touch) to run our brittle packages (I *want* matlab in my head - I'm <br>
falling in love with this old, crusty and powerful package right now). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If this fine-grain incremental upload is infeasible, merely beckoning to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the surviving set of strange attractors constituting your personality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with virgin circuitry will depend on their evolution-shaped propensity to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cross over into new territory. Since this never happens in real life (though</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lesion tolerance &amp; recovery is based on semi-dormant, redundant circuitry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;taking over the part of vanquished one), it is not likely to work.</i><br>
<p>
There are some speculation that the attractors replicate as a part of <br>
mental functioning. In this case adding more "cortex" would give us a <br>
larger mental space. Let's hope its true! :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Alas, I have grown to distrust this Proteus guy (... you never know who he'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be next ;). Most neuroscientists I know are highly sceptical about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unbound malleability of cerebral circuitry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cognitive science is a highly interdisciplinary field, and most</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychologists I know who understand anything about computation are firmly</i><br>
<i>&gt; convinced of the plasticity of mind. I said nothing about "unbound". It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; important to distinguish between computational processes and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; instantiating hardware, even though this is devilishly difficult to do in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the case of the human brain, just as it is with the genetic apparatus.</i><br>
<p>
I think most of the brain is rather static in circuitry, but its meaning <br>
can be very quickly redefined (remember the experiments with glasses <br>
turning everything upside down - after a while vision worked as normal). <br>
My guess is that parts of the cortex are undefined from the beginning, <br>
and later used in various systems that emerge. <br>
