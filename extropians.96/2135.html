Sometime when your in a large lecture class, or where ever you find a <br>
large group of people being quite, cough in one short loud burst &amp;  <br>
note how many people follow suit.  I agree,  these things seem to be<br>
contagious(sp?), but I hesitate to call coughs and yawns memes.  These <br>
things don't replicate as much as they bounce off whatever <br>
trigger mechanism that controls these reflexive behaviors.  I would <br>
liken a cough spreading through a room to a neutron starting a chain <br>
reaction in a fission reactor.<br>
<p>
Pheromones (yes, your spelling is attrociou(sp?) :-)), and body language  <br>
could be involved in a process that is more like replication.  However, I <br>
think going any further will bring up a discussion about definitions, and <br>
I don't know enough pheromones or replicators to comfortably continue.<br>
<p>
By the way, I've been evolving for 26 years.<br>
