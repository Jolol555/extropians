<i>&gt; Slouches towards Cyberspace to be born?"</i><br>
<p>
Nietzsche scholars, correct me if I'm wrong;  but I think Nietzsche was <br>
referring to the Russians, not the Germans, when he coined the <br>
expression "Blonde Beast."  Does anyone recall the original context for <br>
this?  <br>
<p>
Anyway I don't think the Blonde Beast meme  (as it has developed   <br>
since Nietzsche's time)  is viable.  It doesn't create a stable community <br>
around itself.   <br>
<p>
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered the world, not <br>
because they were Blonde Beasts, but because they were *not* beasts.  <br>
They were civilized men.  They were, in fact, Christians.  In the <br>
20th century, we have lost the thread, and the civilization of Europe is <br>
only a memory;  and we have, at the same time, lost our strength.  <br>
Some people think we can get our strength back by being Blonde <br>
Beasts.  I doubt it.  That's exactly the wrong way to go.  <br>
<p>
Andray also writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Several people of my acquaintance seem bothered by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; neo-Nietzschean subtext in a lot of Extropian rhetoric,</i><br>
<p>
What rhetoric are you referring to?  I don't recall seeing any such <br>
rhetoric on the list.  I'm the only one here (as far as I can tell) who is <br>
seriously unhappy with the PC world we live in.  I have never been a <br>
spokesman for Extropianism, and in any case I'm not going to be here <br>
much longer.  <br>
<p>
By the way, "Andray" is pig-Latin for "Rand," isn't it?  <br>
