I just read a great book, with a lot of Extropian thought in it.  Society of <br>
the Mind, by Eric L. Harry.  It's a good introduction to a lot of Extropian <br>
ideas, because one of the characters is being introduced to the ideas very <br>
quickly -- virtual reality, human-level AI, genetic algorithims, memetics and <br>
so forth.  The quality of writing is excellent.<br>
<p>
I'm wondering if anyone's heard of Eric Harry before.  Is he a member of the <br>
Extropy Institute?<br>
<p>
It's kind of wierd... I was at the library, not even intending to borrow any <br>
fiction books, and as I rode up the escalator, I glanced at the large display <br>
of new fiction books, and I immediately saw the book (from about twenty meters <br>
away) and had a strong urge to check it out.  So after I was done getting the <br>
other stuff I wanted, I went over and took a look at it.  The description on <br>
the dust jacket made it sound kind of interesting, so I borrowed the book.  <br>
When I got home I started reading it, and after about twenty pages or so,  I <br>
was thinking "Oh, my God! This is the stuff I've been thinking about for the <br>
past while, and here it is, in a book."  It was just kind of wierd that I felt <br>
such an attraction to it and it matched my thoughts so well.  I have these <br>
types of experiences all the time, where I just feel strongly attracted to <br>
something, and it turns out to be exactly what I'm looking for; like I'm <br>
thinking about something, and it helps me clarify my thoughts and develop them <br>
further.  Generally, I'm attracted to books and things which were created by <br>
people who think similarly to myself, and I'm attracted even before I really <br>
know anything about the book.  I just see it, and  whammo!  I want it, and it <br>
turns out to be just what I need.  Do you guys have these type of experiences? <br>
 I don't even have the metaphysical framework to understand how these things <br>
happen.<br>
	Although I guess there's the idea that I'm living in a virtual reality world <br>
and the computer's kind of directing me to what I'm looking for.  But I don't <br>
really have any compelling evidence to support that idea, beyond the <br>
experiences I indicated.<br>
	Well, there's also the idea that people's minds are connected in subtle ways, <br>
like telepathy, and that we form some sort of collective thought space, and so <br>
of course I would recognize these books and be attracted to them, because I'm <br>
tuned in more to like-minded people, who've written the books and who've read <br>
the books, so I recognize them because like-minded people also recognize them. <br>
 I don't know.  What do you guys think?<br>
