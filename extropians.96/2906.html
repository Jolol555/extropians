<i>&gt; &gt;comm. tool by writing in 3D.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not so sure of that. A researcher at Palo Alto's research center </i><br>
<i>&gt; told to Wired Magazine:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    "In its ultimate environment, VR causes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    computer to become effectively invisible by taking over the human</i><br>
<i>&gt;    sensory and affector systems. VR is extremely useful in scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;    visualization and entertainment, and will be very significant for</i><br>
<i>&gt;    those niches. But as a tool for productively changing everyone's</i><br>
<i>&gt;    relationship to computation, it has two crucial flaws. First, at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    present time [1992], and probably for decades, it cannot produce a</i><br>
<i>&gt;    simulation of significant verisimilitude at reasonable cost. That</i><br>
<i>&gt;    means that users will not be fooled and the computer will not be out</i><br>
<i>&gt;    of the way. Second, and most importantly, it has the goal of fooling</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the user - of leaving the everyday physical world behind. This is at</i><br>
<i>&gt;    odds with the goal of better integrating the computer into human</i><br>
<i>&gt;    activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

To use VR as a comm. tool it doesn't need to be much more advanced <br>
than it is at the moment.  Having an extra dimension in 3D as opposed <br>
to 2D "writing" lets us use the extra dimension to represent more <br>
information, eg. closer to you might be earlier, while further away <br>
is later.  This allows us to arrange info in a more meaningful <br>
and intuitive way.<br>
The minimum requirements for this setup are:<br>
  a navigable 3D environment with moderate resolution (1024 X 768).<br>
  a way of hanging documents, movie clips and sound in this <br>
  environment.<br>
Current VRML specs are very close to achieving this.  <br>

<i>&gt; &gt;As more of our communication moves </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to the electronic platform, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;written speech will become less </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;important, less productive and more </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of a subset of communication </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than it's very backbone.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When telephone was invented, many predicted that mail would disapear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It didn't.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When radio was invented, many predicted that newspapers and books would </i><br>
<i>&gt; disapear. It didn't.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now that numerical communication appears, you predict that written </i><br>
<i>&gt; communication will fade away. I'm septic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I never wrote so much since I use a computer!</i><br>
<p>
Agreed, maybe I did not emphasize my last phrase enough.  I think <br>
that written speech will become a subset of our communication which <br>
incorporates sound, images and writing.  It will definetely not <br>
disappear (not soon anyway).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Parallel-non linear languages </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;will free                                       </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;our minds from a thousands year old </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinking paradigm, making </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinking and communicating</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a much more liquid experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that communication tend to be more a serial process than</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking (or thinking more parallel than communicating). Ideally, we should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific languages for communicating and different ones for thinking.</i><br>
<p>
If we think parrallely, it would be a great advantage to be able to <br>
communicate in this way as well.  Computer networks work best if the <br>
connections are digital, since computers think digitally.<br>
