I think you mean 10^7 to 10^8, making 65 million years a<br>
reasonable interval between such events.<br>

That's a very interesting point, and probably correct. The flux<br>
of comets reaching the inner solar system (and therefore the<br>
frequency of K-T events) is strongly affected by the rate at<br>
which other stars pass within ~100,000 AU of the Sun. That's<br>
expected to be in the 10^7 to 10^8 range for the solar system.<br>
This rate would certainly be much higher, perhaps a couple<br>
of orders of magnitude higher, closer to the galactic core.<br>
But I'm not sure how this would affect evolution. Mass extinctions<br>
every few million years, rather than every ~50 million years,<br>
might help intelligent life to evolve. A million years is<br>
long enough to allow intelligent life to evolve. Frequent<br>
mass extinctions might mean more frequent opportunities for<br>
a species to evolve in different ways. Also, frequent perturbations<br>
to cometary orbits might remove most of the existing comets<br>
around a star, over the course of billions of years. So, <br>
although the flux of comets would be high at first, for a<br>
star closer to the galactic core, there is no assurance<br>
that it would remain high.<br>
