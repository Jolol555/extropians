                <br>
<p>
Suppose I'm wrong, suppose the mind is not the product of digital information  <br>
but is caused by something else, call it Process X. Let's examen this  <br>
mysterious Process X with a flow chart.<br>
<p>
1) Is what the Process X  does complex ? If yes go to 2 if no explain how     <br>
   to reconcile that with experience, both objective and subjective.<br>
<p>
2) Is Process X  itself complex? If yes go to 3 if no then religious people       <br>
   are right, the soul exists, science can't explain it and we're wasting our       <br>
   time with logic and trying to learn how the brain operates.<br>
<p>
3) Is Process X made of parts? If yes go to 4 if no explain how something can       <br>
   be complex yet have no structure.<br>
<p>
4) Does the Process X  operate in an uncoordinated, incoherent manner?    <br>
   If no go to 5 if yes explain how to reconcile that with experience, both       <br>
   objective and  subjective.<br>
<p>
5) Do the parts communicate among themselves? If yes go to 6 if no explain       <br>
   how coordination is possible without communication.<br>
<p>
6) Is a part that changes in only one way ( a bit) the simplest part of the       <br>
   mind? If yes go to 7 if no then something that does not change at all is       <br>
   the essence of the mind and religious people are right, the soul exists,       <br>
   science can't explain it and were wasting our time with logic and trying      <br>
   to learn how the brain operates.<br>
<p>
7) Is Process X information processing ? If yes then I'm right, if no then    <br>
   explain what the difference is.                  <br>
                   <br>

<i>                &gt;the whole Halting Problem says nothing about my understanding                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;how my mental architecture works, just my predicting what it                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;will do.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I would maintain that there is a direct relationship between the degree you <br>
understand something and the degree you can predict what it will do, in fact, <br>
that's what "understand" means.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;I know how my computer works, but it still beats me at                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;arithmetic.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nobody understands how a computer works, if we did we wouldn't need them for <br>
arithmetic.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;the things  [Quantum Computers] are SO damned useful and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;there's no theoretical reason why it shouldn't work. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree that nobody has found a show stopper yet, but there's still a lot we <br>
don't know about Quantum decoherence, error correction and how to program in <br>
Quantum logic. At the current rate of progress I think in 5 years, maybe less, <br>
we'll know for sure if it's possible or not, after that it would just be a<br>
(very difficult) engineering project and the Universe will never be the same. <br>
It would make Drexler's Nanotechnology look like the stone age, but I would <br>
still say there is a 40% chance that such a machine is impossible. Ask me  <br>
again in 5 years.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;As I understand it, an STM should suffice for manufacturing                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the workhorse quantum dots.  We might have it by next year.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Quantum dots have already been made, but it's a long way from there to a  <br>
Quantum Computer. A Quantum Computer is FAR more than a computer that has <br>
parts that operate according to Quantum principles, throw away all your  <br>
programming books, the very logical architecture of the machine would operate <br>
according to Quantum principles. When I hear about Quantum computers my gut<br>
says that the Universe must not allow such a bizarre object to exist, and yet <br>
advances in the last year point strongly in the opposite direction.<br>

<i>                &gt;make it.</i><br>
                   <br>
I don't know what you mean, General Relativity says the space-time distance <br>
between 2 events is the same in any frame of reference.<br>
