Exactly -- the most likely result of widespread Java use is to make the<br>
underlying hardware and operating system irrelevant, as C and its<br>
standardised I/O libraries essentially did for character-based software. <br>
That could be good for Sun, Linux and Apple but bad for Microsoft and<br>
other O/S monsters, though M$ will probably sell more applications as a<br>
result. <br>
<p>
Personally I don't think that it will be as big as its supporters claim,<br>
for the same reason that most of us don't use P-code any more. It's just<br>
not fast enough for many operations, even when compiled locally. Also, the<br>
great thing about standard classes is that everyone can have one of their<br>
very own ;-). People will soon decide that the basic Java classes aren't<br>
enough and start writing their own OS-specific extensions, just as many<br>
Web pages now expect you to have fifteen different plug-ins for your Web<br>
browser; "New WhizzBang/Java requires the Microsoft Only-For-Windows(tm)<br>
class"... <br>

<p>
Reliable verification is, of course, impossible (remember the Halting<br>
Problem?). The best you can hope for is that version N+1 of the class will<br>
catch the trojan horses that hackers got past version N. The only real way<br>
to 'verify' code is by the reputation of the supplier. I trust Id Software<br>
enough to believe that Java-Doom won't erase my hard disk, but definitely<br>
don't feel the same way about foo@bar.com. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the security bugs in java that were neccessary to</i><br>

<p>
Not in my Web browser they won't, nor will they be in any Web browser used<br>
by any rational corporation. Luckily, most of the market for Java will<br>
probably be in standalone applications, which can be bought shrinkwrapped<br>
from reliable suppliers and if neccesary run with limited priviledges. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This should also be accompanied by an explosion in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the long awaited net trade.</i><br>
<p>
Just like controlled fusion, it always seems to be only a short time away<br>
;-). <br>
