As I see it, this thread is a fight between two mutually compatible and<br>
obviously true propositions:<br>
<p>
1)  The amount of freedom is directly proportional to the amount of<br>
information citizens have about government officials.<br>
2)  The amount of freedom is inversely proportional to the amount of<br>
information the government officials have about citizens.<br>
<p>
The fallacy is that somehow officials and citizens always need to have<br>
the same amount of privacy.  Any measures that are claimed to "reduce<br>
privacy" will reduce the privacy of citizens more than the privacy of<br>
officials.  Specifically anti-government measures such as FIA may reduce<br>
citizen-to-citizen privacy but will definitely, if they work, reduce<br>
government privacy.<br>
<p>
The goal:  Make citizen privacy complete and government privacy zero<br>
except for secret weapons and such.  Citizen-to-citizen privacy is<br>
always greater than citizen-to-government publicity, since the<br>
government can hire citizens.  Citizen-to-citizen privacy must therefore<br>
also be complete.<br>
<p>
The obvious solution is to invent a polyencephalographic veridicator and<br>
require all officials to wear one.  Better yet, require all officials to<br>
be computers and make the source code freely available.<br>
<p>
More practically, cryptography should be legal and all officials should<br>
submit to 24-hour video surveilance with all tapes freely available. <br>
Another advantage of both systems is that being an official will be much<br>
less attractive.<br>
