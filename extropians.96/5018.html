<i>&gt; Sorry, can't let you get away with that. Microsoft does *more* usability</i><br>
<i>&gt; testing than anyone. They may have often produced buggy first versions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; products (hardly unique), but they learn fast and end up with the best.</i><br>
<p>
IMHO usability testing is a blind alley when we are talking new technology.<br>
Any sufficiently good new technology will create it's own market.(Hey make<br>
that Max M's law number 1 :-) ) There was no market for Personal Computers<br>
when they were developed. Neither for the Mac. They created their own<br>
market.<br>
Off course usability testing is of some help in interface development but<br>
only for marginal improvements. The far most important thing to have a good<br>
idea from the beginning.<br>
<p>
Both Microsoft, Apple and most others out there have grinded to a<br>
standstill when it comes to GUI's. The most interresting stuff right now<br>
happens in games and Multimedia.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Anyone else using and loving MS FrontPage for creating and managing web</i><br>
sites.<br>
<p>
I use it. Love it? It's currently the best tool i think, but check out<br>
<a href="http://www.netobjects.com">http://www.netobjects.com</a> their software is far better. It has some serious<br>
troubles though with crossplatform sites with long texts. (A 12 point Times<br>
New Roman isn't the same size on Mac's and PC's)<br>
