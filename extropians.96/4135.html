I said:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;It's not to be taken seriously.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If you don't like it then simply delete it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;However (to paraphrase), "One can die as surely from a million pinpricks</i><br>
<i>&gt;as from a single sword thrust.".  I get plenty of junk mail from random</i><br>
<i>&gt;ad agencies -- et tu, Chris?  (Max, actually, in case he's still following</i><br>

<p>
Yup, I sure do.<br>

<i>&gt;The danger in the snowball and all chain letters is their exponential</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature.  The note isn't just sent to 100 people and back -- it's sent to</i><br>
<i>&gt;"everybody you know".  I personally could make it to over 1000 people</i><br>
<i>&gt;easily -- I wonder how many each of them can reach?  Follow that exponential</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth curve out a few steps and the traffic could become dizzying, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;well-connected people could end up getting dozens of copies without sending</i><br>
<i>&gt;out a single one -- no wonder chain letters have such a bad rep!  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt;net.gurus I know have been predicting the meltdown of the Internet backbones</i><br>
<i>&gt;for a while now (apparently it's already started) -- this sort of thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;certainly doesn't help matters.</i><br>
<p>
Bzzzt! The idea of the Death of the Internet has alot in common with<br>
society's entropic fixation with an imaginary overpopulation problem. I<br>
have great faith in human ingenuity because of it's proved-record of<br>
effectiveness throughout history. We can always stack more people higher or<br>
lower on the planet or even send them into space. Genengineering will allow<br>
us to accomplish incredible feats such as vegetable trees or fruit trees<br>
going through cycles having more fruit than leaves. I read in the LA Times<br>
a while back that they've discovered a hormone to turn any bud on a plant<br>
into a flower so that eventually we could turn any thorn, leaf, or stem bud<br>
into a flower to eventually grow into fruit. In China they're already<br>
breeding two kinds of rice together to create a "super rice" for the 21st<br>
century that could feed thousands more. And to cut down the evidence<br>
supporting the idea even further, the population increase in western<br>
countries has been steadily declining. As for the internet, the major<br>
telcos have invested huge sums of money in it and are nowhere near allowing<br>
it all to go down the tubes. Annual chain letters are a perfect way to test<br>
out the infrastucture and besides this specific chain letter only occurs in<br>
the month of December because it's a "snowball fight". This may prove to be<br>
an internet test-run that occurs at the close of each year due to the<br>
populatity of the meme. This meme could very well force the telcos to<br>
upgrade their systems and allow us many free resources when the "snowball<br>
fight" dies down. You may wish to quickly dub me naive, but the supporting<br>
facts are all there so all the wasted breath over overpopulation and the<br>
death of the net are just more disasterbation.<br>
