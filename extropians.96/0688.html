<i>&gt;&gt;As Nicholas said, its implausible that a very hard step, such as</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;unless some special very usual environment was involved (and its hard</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to see what that could be).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In that case, I suppose that evidence for language use among pongids and</i><br>
<i>&gt;cetaceans would strengthen the argument for identifying the bulk of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Filter with the development of linguistic ability, would it not?</i><br>
<p>
Do you mean that a potential for language ability developed long ago,<br>
and just flowered "recently" as brains got big?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One thing about birds is that they have wings, and so most of them have</i><br>
<i>&gt;strong selective pressure favoring flight, which selects against large</i><br>
<i>&gt;brains.  ... These two</i><br>
<i>&gt;factors might be enough to keep the birds "Filtered" out for at least a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;million more years even if their brains have the same neurostructural basis</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary for the ultimate development of language use.</i><br>
<p>
The question is: had there not been mammals around when the dinos were<br>
wiped out, could the birds have radiated to fill the gap, and followed<br>
a similar trajectory to our position within a hundred million years?<br>
If yes, this is not a hard step.<br>

<p>
If hands were so hard, why did they happen so soon after brains were<br>
near ready to use them?  Or ask the same question about bipedalism.<br>
And if you take a long view, graphing encephalization on a log plot<br>
over a hundred million years, growth really is roughly steady since<br>
the dinos were killed.<br>

<p>
Without big brains, the ability to sweat probably wouldn't have got us<br>
far.  So the hard thing to understand is, if sweating is so hard, why<br>
did it happen so fast after the big brains arrived?<br>
