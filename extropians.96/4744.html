<p>
Now *thats* a fun idea! I wonder what kind of normal basis spans it?<br>
<p>
As I see it, 'god' is an epithet we give to tremendously powerful beings, <br>
not some special attribute of a being. In the classic era it wasn't that <br>
unreasonable to pronounce the dead emperor a god, the dividing line <br>
between mortals and immortals was seen as rather hazy. In David Zindell's <br>
books the posthuman jupiter- or nebula-minds are called gods and <br>
sometimes worshipped.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You seem to be saying that deity space is now empty, but is not </i><br>
<i>&gt; *necessarily* empty.  Gods can exist, but they don't exist yet.  </i><br>
<p>
Exactly. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are postulating that deity space is like music space or </i><br>
<i>&gt; machine space -- gods are the sort of thing that can be created.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are also postulating that the entities that populate deity space  </i><br>
<i>&gt; may or may not laugh -- it is possible for gods to be either </i><br>
<i>&gt; laughing or non-laughing; Jove or YHWH.   </i><br>
<p>
:-) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure if you are also assuming that deity space is now empty, </i><br>
<i>&gt; like music space was before the first song was sung.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, as I see it each person has his or her own deity space in her world <br>
model, although there could be said to exist a cultural or global deity <br>
space too. People certainly believe in inhabitants, but I would argue <br>
that these beings are really just mental constructs themselves, <br>
personifications of memes, rather than external beings. And I wouldn't <br>
regard them as deities myself, they are not *that* powerful (just powerful).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem is, there is a non-laughing god who claims that he </i><br>
<i>&gt; already exists, and that he is the King of the Hill; and who backs up </i><br>
<i>&gt; these claims by inspiring his followers to exert a real force in the world.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; He calls himself YHWH, or "the Lord."  </i><br>
<p>
[It is worth noting that the judeo-christian idea of God seems to be that<br>
there exists a "special" element, God, in the deity space, perhaps the<br>
zero-element but more likely the "largest" or most "perfect" element. ]<br>
<p>
Yes, this is a problem. Of course, not all of his followers think that he <br>
is non-laughing. In fact, I think most "ordinary believers" would argue <br>
that he has humour too, simply because it makes him easier to trust <br>
(which is what they really want with him). It is the theologicians and <br>
preachers that believe in a non-laughing god, but unfortunately they are <br>
good at dragging the masses after them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is only one recorded instance, that I know of, where he laughed </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Psalm #2):  </i><br>
- - - <br>
<i>&gt; "The One enthroned in heaven laughs" --  this is not Jovial laughter, </i><br>
<i>&gt; this is the har har har of the victor stomping his opponent's head.  </i><br>
<p>
Or perhaps the mad scientist laughter: "Those FOOLS! I will deestroy them <br>
all! HAHAHAHAHA!!!" :-)<br>
<p>
I think it illustrates my point; people in general want a great bearded old <br>
man on a cloud, not something transcendent. And it is easier to believe <br>
even in a slightly psychotic patriarch that crushes people with his iron <br>
sceptre than an ineffable light that is beyond emotion. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The English word "Lord" has become such a cliche' that it has lost </i><br>
<i>&gt; most of its meaning.  If you consider the Latin equivalent, Dominus, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the meaning is clearer:  the Lord is somebody who dominates.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Boss.  Somebody you don't treat with disrespect, or even with </i><br>
<i>&gt; too much familiarity.  The peasants don't talk back to the Lord of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Manor, let alone laugh at him.  They approach him with fear and </i><br>
<i>&gt; trembling. </i><br>
<p>
If you really believe in the patriarch on the cloud and that he behaves <br>
as the Old Testament says, then it is a very reasonable approach. <br>
Obedience to someone who is much more powerful than oneself and quite <br>
willing to use this power is a survival strategy - but it doesn't have to <br>
be total obedience, just apparent obedience. The New Testament meme of <br>
loving God is more radical since it demands total obedience in exchange <br>
for happiness. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the presence of YHWH, one doesn't laugh.  One bends the knee.  </i><br>
<p>
This was what a seventh day adventist said to me. To which I responded <br>
"And a god who makes you kneel isn't worth loving". Strangely, many <br>
christians seem to forget which meme/testament they are following.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question is whether it is possible to "create" a new god, </i><br>
<i>&gt; a more Jovial god, who can laugh at anything and get away with it -- </i><br>
<i>&gt; and who can even stand being joked about.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The operational meaning of this is:   Can such a god </i><br>
<i>&gt; inspire his followers to exert a real force in the world?  </i><br>
<p>
I think so. As I have written above, many people have a personal<br>
relationship with their gods and doesn't want big bosses that force them<br>
to do things; even the total obedience of love doesn't preclude joking<br>
with the loved one (although I assume one reason some gods are<br>
non-laughing is that their omniscience always reveal the punchline too<br>
soon). <br>
<p>
Memetically, I think it might be possible to come up with a laughing deity<br>
that fits the present. There are plenty of people dissatisified with<br>
conventional religion, who might flock around a laughing deity especially<br>
since it undermines so much of the established "truths". A youth<br>
transhumanist religion? <br>
<p>
Any virians listening?<br>
<p>
Personally my favorite is Hermes, who certainly is the god of the Internet.<br>
