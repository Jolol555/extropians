I was reading the scifi book snow crash and I began to wonder if the idea of<br>
"The Raft" is a truely practical idea. How easy would it be to put one large<br>
ship in the middle of a forest of docking? You could subsidize the whole<br>
thing by people renting boat docks and gambling in international waters.<br>
Does anyone have any ideas or papers relating to this? And don't tell me<br>
oceania, that only discourages me due to the way they have the website layed<br>
out like its already in existance. I am beginning to think that it _is_<br>
possible to create a libertarian society living on the sea! Do I see traces<br>
of WaterWorld? of course the Atoll in that movie would've never survived in<br>
the open sea due to it being constructed so structurally unstable and<br>
unsuitable for large open sea swells meaning that it couldn't survive<br>
anything other than directly off the coast. I propose to give this, as yet<br>
non-existant country Aurora, Land of the Libertarians.<br>
