Hello again folks,<br>
<p>
I didn't mean to distract the conversation onto libertarianism versus<br>
collectivism -- I understand that y'all are mostly libertarian-oriented<br>
and probably don't want to argue politics with someone who fundamentally<br>
disagrees with you.<br>
<p>
What worries me really is the link between transhumanism and<br>
individualism -- a link which is reflected in Libertarian politics.<br>
<p>
Transhumanism, to me, means going beyond humanity -- but it is not<br>
necessarily an INDIVIDUAL quest, is it?  Can't we think in terms of the<br>
whole human race transcending itself?<br>
<p>
As I see it, none of us truly has an individual "self" -- the self<br>
is a social/cultural construct.  We are all, in the end, made up<br>
of EACH OTHER.  (This sounds flaky perhaps, but as I have shown in my<br>
book "Chaotic Logic" it can be put on a mathematical basis).  <br>
It is true that in becoming trans-human we may lose our "selves" as<br>
currently conceived and thus lose this fundamental sociality.  But<br>
it is also possible that sociality is inherent to intelligence.  IN<br>
fact it is my inclination to believe this is true (as I argued in<br>
a recent paper in Informatica called "Artificial Selfhood," also<br>
contained at my website <a href="http://godel.psy.uwa.edu.au/">http://godel.psy.uwa.edu.au/</a>)<br>
<p>
If sociality is a necessary part of mind, then we need to be thinking<br>
about transhumanism on a social rather than just individual level.<br>
This is not really a criticism of Extropianism as it stands, more a<br>
call for a different sort of emphasis.<br>
