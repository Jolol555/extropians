<i>&gt; The Gradient Theorem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it is a theorem in economics that if the genie machines are finite,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the MNT scenario is not stable.  Any approximation to it is unstable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, there is a gradient away from self-sufficiency, in the direction of</i><br>
<i>&gt; more trade.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By "finite" I mean:</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1. The genie machines use energy (they are not perpetual motion</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines).</i><br>
<i>&gt;       2. The genie machines perform their tasks at some measurable rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; (not instantaneously), and different tasks take different times.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       3.  The cost of retooling or reprogramming a machine is nonzero,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the cost varies depending on what kind of retooling is done.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       4. The genie machines have an interface that requires some</i><br>
<i>&gt; expertise and effort on the part of the user -- genie machines have to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmed, rather than merely commanded.  (Or if they can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; commanded, the commands have to be so detailed that it is a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble to give them properly, so "commanding" amounts to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing as "programming.")  Different tasks requite different degrees of</i><br>
<i>&gt; expertise and effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[SNIP of a reasonably convincing argument from the premises, ending<br>
with...]<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If it requires *any* more effort than that -- in other words, if there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; any significant difference between the effort required to produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; different items -- then the situation is unstable.  The inequality of effort</i><br>
<i>&gt; will create a gradient leading away from self-sufficiency, toward an</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy with trade and ever-increasing specialization.</i><br>

Your argument is intended to cover both goods and information, I think.<br>
With<br>
respect to goods, your argument make the assumption that the cost of<br>
transportation<br>
is negligable, or at least that the cost is less than the difference in<br>
cost<br>
between the buyer's manufacturing cost and the seller's manufacturing<br>
cost of the<br>
good the seller is attempting to sell.<br>
<p>
As your argument relates to information, you are correct. But I don't<br>
need<br>
much information to live lavishly, so you're not talking about the<br>
difference<br>
between life and death, as "making a living" means to most of the<br>
world's<br>
population. You are only talking about relatively marginal changes, in<br>
some<br>
sense. I believe that your economy reduces to only a trade in design and<br>
other knowledge. Many designer will in fact make their designbs freely<br>
available. This happens today, and is more likely to happen when the<br>
designer doesn't have to worry about making a living.<br>
