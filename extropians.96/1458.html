<i>&gt; I think I've been sloppy in my posts on this topic (especially the post that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Peter McCluskey responded to), so let me try to do better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yor posts are not usually sloppy, at least to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The three obvious contributors to the intelligence of the world economy are</i><br>
<i>&gt; population size, the raw speed of human brains, and knowledge (both tacit and</i><br>
<i>&gt; explicit).  While there are other constributors, such as some high level</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizational issues, I doubt they are that important, and expect progress</i><br>
<i>&gt; on improving them to be slow.</i><br>
<p>
I feel strongly that speed of access to information and speed of<br>
disemmination<br>
of new information are very important contributore to the equation.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Knowledge and population have been increasing for some time.  As the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy grows, the more we know, the better we get at learning more, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger population we can support.  And being richer, we've been able to spend</i><br>
<i>&gt; more on research, and on tools to aide research.  (Tools are really</i><br>
<i>&gt; artificats that embody knowledge, in my view.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Computers are just one of those tools, and haven't really aided research much</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than other important tools, like cars and air conditioning.  Progress in</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers is driven by the size of the market for computers - the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers folks buy, the more researchers are employed, and so the more ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; get tried out.</i><br>
<p>
Computers are a new phenomon. Their impact is only now being seriously<br>
felt.<br>
So far, the contribution to knowledge has been mostly in the<br>
infrastructure:<br>
Communications, word processing, publishing, etc. More recently,<br>
automated<br>
lab insturments have dramatically increased progress in some fields,<br>
notably<br>
genetic sequencing. E-mail and the web are now the communications media<br>
of<br>
choice in several disciplines, including branches of math, astronomy,<br>
and<br>
physics. but also in other areas. Comuputers are now essential elements<br>
in the<br>
development of new digital circuits, including new computers. Thus, I<br>
feel<br>
that the situatin you describe is changing very rapidly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus we have had a feedback process of growth of knowledge (and tools) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; population for some time.  The big change I see looming here is that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; decreases in the cost, and increases in speed, of individual brains with</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploads.  And especially the ability to make copies, which decreases the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of filling new brains with knowledge (the big limit on our growth rate now).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since this should drive down the cost of labor, research gets cheaper, and so</i><br>
<i>&gt; more should be done.</i><br>
<p>
I prefer not ot predict the exact nature of the way computers will<br>
augment<br>
intelligence, since IMO it's not central to our discussion. I feel that<br>
uploading is considerably harder than other approaches to human/computer<br>
collaborative entities.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As our technology of uploads improves, for the same price we can either make</i><br>
<i>&gt; faster brains or more brains.  It is not obvious which option will be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; preferred - the most important thing isn't brain speed but brain cost per</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed.  In particular, research may get done by a few very fast very</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive brains, but I'd guess lots of slower brains to be the usual case.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If uploads are similar to other types of algorithms, faster will be<br>
preferable<br>
to more, because multiple processors spend a lot of time on<br>
cummunication<br>
of intermediate results.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway, I basically agree that a change we can envision will increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth rate, but I think folks are confused about the root cause.  The basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue isn't brain speed, nor cost per speed.  Human brains are actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty cheap out there at the moment.  The big change is lowering the cost of</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating knowledge-filled brains, with upload copies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I feel that "knowledge-filled" will be superceeded by the ability to<br>
access<br>
the entire knowledge base at a very high data rate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If average brain speed goes up as the growth rate, the subjective effect to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the participants may not be that different from today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This is likely to be correct. The "Singularity' affects only the meat<br>
humans, not<br>
the digital ones, assuming that the extended interacting algorithms<br>
remain in the<br>
form of individual uploaded humans. my guess would be that this is not<br>
the most<br>
efficient or the most likely form of the algorithm, however.<br>
