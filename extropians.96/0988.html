Let's hope it is the former.  The term "social engineering" refers not to<br>
enlightened use of technology, but achieving political goals through the<br>
use of force or subterfuge.<br>
<p>
Likewise, most "social sciences" have little to do with science.  Their<br>
role is to provide the justification for social engineering (i.e., backing<br>
up pet  theories with mountains of statistics).  My favorite example is a<br>
book written in the 1960s by Ghana's dictator (Kwame Nkrumah?).  In it, he<br>
offered "scientific formulae" to determine when conditions were ripe for<br>
revolution, and how to make a revolution.  I hope I still have it -- it's a<br>
classic. &lt;g&gt;<br>
