First of all I want to say that Damien Broderick's well written post on Oct 8  <br>
was a joy to read and respond to. I don't think Damien is correct about his <br>
skepticism of Nanotechnology, but he certainly shows us how to argue  <br>
intelligently and forcefully and yet remain civilized. I think we should all  <br>
follow his example, including me.   <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Damien quoting Drexler: `If a car were assembled from                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;normal-sized robots from a thousand pieces, each piece having                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;been assembled by smaller robots from a thousand smaller             </i><br>
<i>                &gt;pieces [...] then only ten levels of assembly process would  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;separate cars from molecules.' (UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE, 1991,                </i><br>
<i>                &gt; p. 66)</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I re-read that passage in Drexler's popular book, it seems to me that he was <br>
trying to demonstrate to the general reader how small an atom was  and how <br>
many it would take to build a car, about 10^30. He was also  trying to <br>
demonstrate that even this huge number is not out of reach if you have <br>
command of exponential processes, and with Nanotechnology you would with self <br>
replication. In his example you can tackle that number in just 10 steps  <br>
(1000^10 = 10^30). I don't think Drexler was trying to suggest that the best <br>
way to build a car was to do it in stages, each using 1000 parts until you  <br>
get to atoms at stage 10.<br>
<p>
On page 60 of "Engines of Creation" he talks about building (growing?) a <br>
rocket engine in one step using general purpose assemblers. You place a <br>
"seed" nanocomputer that has the complete plans for the engine in the center <br>
of a tank. The tank is filled with a fluid full of assemblers. The seed <br>
nanocomputer has places on the outside of it for assemblers in the fluid to<br>
stick to it, the seed sends instructions to the assemblers connected to it, <br>
telling those machines  what their position is in relation to the seed, and <br>
telling them how many other assemblers they should snag, and what their <br>
position must be, and what instructions to send them.  The chain keeps <br>
growing and soon an assembler scaffolding for the entire rocket engine is in <br>
place, with each assembler knowing its position relative to the seed.  <br>
Now it's time to begin  manufacturing. Drain the tank of its fluid full of <br>
excess assemblers and pour in a new fluid that has chemical fuel (food) for <br>
the assemblers and raw materials, mostly carbon, for the construction. <br>
A few hours later your rocket engine is finished.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you needed a huge number of rocket engines very quickly <br>
you might not want to rely entirely on general purpose assemblers and make <br>
everything in one step. Some parts, like carbon fibers, would be used in <br>
almost all the things you would want to make, so it would be more efficient <br>
to make them with special purpose assemblers rather than use the more <br>
flexible but slower  general assemblers. Also, because you'd need to do it a <br>
lot It would also be helpful to have a specialized tool to stretch the sleeve <br>
of a bearing so you can fit it over a shaft. Drexler talks about mass <br>
producing modular building blocks that you use frequently, like identical <br>
CPU's and memory arrays. Most of these blocks would be less than 10 <br>
nanometers but a few could be as large as 1000  nanometers (10^-6 meters), <br>
still far too small to see.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Compare this with living replicators (the single existence                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;proof available). Genetic algorithms in planetary numbers </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
One existence proof is all that is needed, and huge numbers are no problem <br>
for Nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
                  <br>
<i>                &gt;lurch about for billions of years, replicating and mutating                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and being winnowed via their expressed phenotypic success </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
"Lurch" is a good word for it. The reason it took billions of years to  <br>
produce us is that evolution is so dumb. Even the crummiest designer is  <br>
brilliant compared to a random cosmic ray hitting a strand of DNA causing a  <br>
mutation.             <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;That [DNA] sketchy information gets unpacked via (1) a rich                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;information-dense  environment </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
But that's no different than Nanotechnology because software is always <br>
useless without a computer to run it on. Digital DNA information needs to be <br>
run on a mitochondria to be implemented and produce an output, a protein. <br>
In Nanotechnology digital information also needs to be implemented, in an  <br>
assembler in this case, to produce an output, a physical structure of any <br>
type not just a protein.<br>

<i>                &gt;the brain wires itself in such a stochastic fashion,                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;*without needing precise wiring diagrams* in the DNA recipe.                  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Even so, it takes 20 years to build and program a natural                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;human-level intelligence </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I don't understand the use of the phrase "even so" in this context. It takes  <br>
a long time exactly because you don't have a precise wiring diagram at birth,  <br>
it takes 20 years of research and development that we call education for the  <br>
body to find such a diagram. When a brain crashes catastrophically, and up <br>
to now every single one has, there is no backup and all that R and D is lost.  <br>
The next brain must re-invent the wheel, there has got to be a better way.<br>

                     <br>
<p>
In section 12.7 of Nanosystems Drexler shows how to store 10^25 bits per cubic <br>
meter in fast RAM, or 10^28 bits in a slower (but still fast by our standards) <br>
"tape" storage. It should also be noted that the arm on a Nanotechnology <br>
based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a human arm, and that <br>
means it could move back and forth 50 million times faster than a human arm. <br>
Also, just one pound of carbon would contain about a billion billion Nano <br>
Robots with such arms.<br>

                  <br>
<p>
Hofstadter is one of my heroes by the way, but as you point out, he was <br>
talking about epistemology not engineering. You don't need to understand why <br>
something  works in order to duplicate it. You can parrot a foreign language <br>
even if you don't know a word of it. A chip designer may have no idea how a <br>
program running on his chip operates. A typist may have no understanding about <br>
what he writes, some would say that if nothing else my post proves that point.                         <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I'm inclined to think we'll get interesting results faster                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;through massively parallel darwinian simulations in digital                 </i><br>

<i>                &gt;Deutsch quantum computations, or even via artfully-coded DNA   </i><br>
<i>                &gt;computations in a meaty broth (a process that's already been                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;used to bust fancy encryption schemes).  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
That would certainly produce interesting results, whether it will be faster <br>
than other approaches I'm not sure. Quantum Computers may not even be <br>
possible ( but probably are, I think) and are certainly much more exotic than <br>
Nanotechnology.<br>

<i>                &gt;nano fabrication, will very quickly escape our understanding</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
If by "our" you mean 3 pound brains made of meat then I agree, but again, you  <br>
don't need to understand why something works to manufacture it. Even now we <br>
can improve things without knowing a lot about it. No one man can have a  <br>
deep understanding about exactly why Windows NT does what it does on all <br>
occasions, yet version 4.0 is better than version 3.51. Besides, I don't <br>
think 3 pounds of meat will be the smartest thing around forever.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;if you mean to build a new, improved car from the atom up,                 </i><br>

<i>                &gt;that Lyle insists upon.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Mostly true, but I don't think it would be all that costly . As I said,  <br>
although not absolutely necessary (evolution), it's very helpful to know what  <br>
you're doing if you want to improve something. I think I made it clear in my  <br>
post that I was just referring to manufacturing.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;might have diverged again </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Perhaps, and that's why I don't think we'd ever use so many steps that we  <br>
could no longer be confident that the parts were absolutely identical, or <br>
have so many different types of parts that it got confusing. I'm not sure <br>
how many steps that would be, but I have a hunch it would be less than 10.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;chemo-gradient-guided self-assembly.  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Chemo-gradient would be a very crude method of informing an assembler of its <br>
position, it may be good enough for life but I doubt it would be used much in  <br>
Nanotechnology, except perhaps in the very earliest examples.<br>
                              <br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;leaving the digital domain, and I think most of us                         </i><br>

<p>
<i>                &gt;Again, if you can specify adequately at the digital level,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;well and good. How many bytes was that, did you say?  (But                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;this is certainly a point in favor of building from the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;lowest level up, if we can.)</i><br>
                              <br>
<p>
If you made up a list that contained the type and position of every atom in a <br>
car this list would contain a HUGE amount of redundancy. If you put  an iron <br>
atom in a particular spot then it's almost certain that the atom you will <br>
want to put next to it will also be an iron atom. We can get rid of this  <br>
massive redundancy and reduce the size of the list by an astronomical amount  <br>
by using the same sort of algorithms we use today for data compression in ZIP  <br>
and GIF files.<br>
