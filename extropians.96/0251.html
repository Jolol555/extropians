[This message was passed along the internet, author unknown, and  <br>
is of interest to the current debate about the possible origin  <br>
and evolution of life on Mars.  If we are infringing upon  <br>
someone's copyright, it is not our intention to do so, and we  <br>
apologize.] <br>
 <br>
ALH84001 is a martian meteorite, a coarse-grained orthopyroxene  <br>
containing relatively large amounts of carbonate, with a  <br>
crystallization age of 4.5 Gyr.  Carbonate globules within  <br>
fractures in the rock are dated at 3.6 Gyr.  Fractionation of  <br>
carbon has taken place to enhance C-13 consistent with  <br>
terrestrial biogenic process (but other processes not excluded).   <br>
PAHs also appear on interior fracture surfaces in excess of 1  <br>
ppm.  They present extensive tests and discussion to show that  <br>
they are confident that these are all indigenous to the meteorite  <br>
and do not represent contamination.  Mass spec studies show these  <br>
PAHs are complex not simple and suggest (to the authors) a  <br>
biogenic source.  They then discuss TEM studies of the Fe/S  <br>
fraction in the meteorite.  Nanometer sized magnetite and Fe- <br>
sulfide phases are associated with Mg-Fe-rich carbonate.  These  <br>
observed structures and concentrations can be explained by either  <br>
inorganic or biogenic processes.  However, they argue that the  <br>
range of conditions (pH) for inorganic precipitation is unlikely  <br>
to have occurred on Mars, whereas biogenic processes seem to  <br>
offer a more natural explanation for the detailed structures  <br>
observed, and they are apparently similar to terrestrial  <br>
magnetofossils (remains of bacterial magnetosomes).  SEM studies  <br>
of carbonate globules are then discussed (typically ovoid and 100  <br>
nm across).  Origin of the ovoids and other observed textures is  <br>
unclear, but they may be related to terrestrial microfossils, or  <br>
they may be erosional features due to partial dissolution of the  <br>
carbonate.  They do not believe these structures result from  <br>
contamination.  They suggest possible microbiological activity  <br>
for both the ovoid carbonate structures and the Fe-sulfides.  On  <br>
the basis of a number of circumstantial arguments, they  <br>
"interpret that the carbonate globules have a biogenic origin and  <br>
were likely formed at low temperatures".  (The temperature of  <br>
formation of the carbonates in this meteorite has been  <br>
controversial)..  "It is possible that all of the described  <br>
features can be explained by inorganic processes, but these  <br>
explanations appear to require restricted conditions." The  <br>
evidence consistent with life includes: (1) penetration of the  <br>
igneous rock by fluid leading to possible organic deposits of  <br>
minerals along veins (2) formation of the carbonate globules much  <br>
later than the formation of the rock itself, (3) SEM and TEM  <br>
images of the globules that resemble terrestrial biogenic  <br>
structures, (4) magnetite and iron sulfide particles that could  <br>
have been formed biogenically.  The authors feel that the  <br>
cumulative effect of these points is to provide "evidence for  <br>
primitive life on early Mars" <br>

 <br>
A NASA research team of scientists at the Johnson Space Center  <br>
and at Stanford University has found evidence that strongly  <br>
suggests primitive life may have existed on Mars more than 3.6  <br>
billion years ago.  The NASA-funded team found the first organic  <br>
molecules thought to be of Martian origin; several mineral  <br>
features characteristic of biological activity; and possible  <br>
microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms inside  <br>
of an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a meteorite.  <br>
This array of indirect evidence of past life will be reported in  <br>
the Aug. 16 issue of the journal Science, presenting the  <br>
investigation to the scientific community at large to reach a  <br>
future consensus that will either confirm or deny the team's  <br>
conclusion. <br>
 <br>
Below is the photographic evidence for this discovery. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
S96-12301 (JPG; TIF) - In the center of this electron microscope  <br>
image of a small chip from a meteorite are several tiny  <br>
structures that are possible microscopic fossils of primitive,  <br>
bacteria-like organisms that may have lived on Mars more than 3.6  <br>
billion years ago. A two-year investigation by a NASA research  <br>
team found organic molecules, mineral features characteristic of  <br>
biological activity and possible microscopic fossils such as  <br>
these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a  <br>
meteorite. The largest possible fossils are less than 1/100th the  <br>
diameter of a human hair in size while most are ten times  <br>
smaller. <br>
 <br>
S96-12299 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image is a close- <br>
up of the center part of photo number S96-12301. While the exact  <br>
nature of these tube-like structures is not known, one  <br>
interpretation is that they may be microscopic fossils of  <br>
primitive, bacteria-like organisms that may have lived on Mars  <br>
more than 3.6 billion years ago.  A two-year investigation by a  <br>
NASA research team found organic molecules, mineral features  <br>
characteristic of biological activity and possible microscopic  <br>
fossils such as these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell  <br>
to Earth as a meteorite. The largest possible fossils are less  <br>
than 1/100th the diameter of a human hair in size while most are  <br>
ten times smaller. <br>
 <br>
S96-12298 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image shows  <br>
extremely tiny tubular structures that are possible microscopic  <br>
fossils of bacteria-like organisms that may have lived on Mars  <br>
more than 3.6 billion years ago. A two-year investigation by a  <br>
NASA research team found organic molecules, mineral features  <br>
characteristic of biological activity and possible microscopic  <br>
fossils such as these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell  <br>
to Earth as a meteorite.  The largest possible fossils are less  <br>
than 1/100th the diameter of a human hair in size while most are  <br>
ten times smaller. The fossil-like structures were found in  <br>
carbonate minerals formed along pre-existing fractures in the  <br>
meteorite in a fashion similar to the way fossils occur in  <br>
limestone on Earth, although on a microscopic scale. <br>
 <br>
S96-12297 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image shows egg- <br>
shaped structures, some of which may be possible microscopic  <br>
fossils of Martian origin as discussed by NASA research published  <br>
in the Aug. 16, 1996, issue of the journal Science. A two-year  <br>
investigation found organic molecules, mineral features  <br>
characteristic of biological activity and possible microscopic  <br>
fossils such as these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell  <br>
to Earth as a meteorite.  The largest possible fossils are less  <br>
than 1/100th the diameter of a human hair in size while most are  <br>
ten times smaller. <br>
 <br>
S96-12300 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image shows  <br>
tubular structures of likely Martian origin. These structures are  <br>
very similar in size and shape to extremely tiny microfossils  <br>
found in some Earth rocks. This photograph is part of a report by  <br>
a NASA research team published in the Aug. 16, 1996, issue of the  <br>
journal Science. A two-year investigation by the team found  <br>
organic molecules, mineral features characteristic of biological  <br>
activity and possible microscopic fossils such as these inside of  <br>
an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a meteorite. The  <br>
largest possible fossils are less than 1/100th the diameter of a  <br>
human hair in size while most are ten times smaller. <br>
 <br>
S96-12609 (JPG; TIF) &amp; S96-12610 (JPG; TIF) - This <br>
high-resolution scanning electron microscope image shows an  <br>
unusual tube-like structural form that is less than 1/100th the  <br>
width of a human hair in size found in meteorite ALH84001, a  <br>
meteorite believed to be of Martian origin. Although this  <br>
structure is not part of the research published in the Aug. 16  <br>
issue of the journal Science, it is located in a similar  <br>
carbonate glob in the meteorite. This structure will be the  <br>
subject of future investigations that could confirm whether or  <br>
not it is fossil evidence of primitive life on Mars 3.6 billion  <br>
years ago. <br>
 <br>
S94-032549 (JPG; TIF) - This 4.5 billion-year-old rock, labeled  <br>
meteorite ALH84001, is believed to have once been a part of Mars  <br>
and to contain fossil evidence that primitive life may have  <br>
existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. The rock is a  <br>
portion of a meteorite that was dislodged from Mars by a huge  <br>
impact about 16 million years ago and that fell to Earth in  <br>
Antarctica 13,000 years ago. The meteorite was found in Allan  <br>
Hills ice field, Antarctica, by an annual expedition of the  <br>
National Science Foundation's Antarctic Meteorite Program in  <br>
1984. It is preserved for study at the Johnson Space Center's  <br>
Meteorite Processing Laboratory in Houston. <br>
 <br>
S95-00690 (JPG; TIF) - This photograph shows orange-colored  <br>
carbonate mineral globules found in a meteorite, called ALH84001,  <br>
believed to have once been a part of Mars. These carbonate  <br>
minerals in the meteorite are believed to have been formed on  <br>
Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. Their structure and  <br>
chemistry suggest that they may have been formed with the  <br>
assistance of primitive, bacteria-like living organisms. A two- <br>
year investigation by a NASA research team found organic  <br>
molecules, mineral features characteristic of biological activity  <br>
and possible microscopic fossils inside of carbonate minerals  <br>
such as these in the meteorite. <br>
