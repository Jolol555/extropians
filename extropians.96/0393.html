IAN: And they've already taken away the amino acid tryptophan just because <br>
one batch from one plant in Japan was contaminated. Just imagine if milk <br>
was forever banned because of one bad batch from one farm. When will <br>
the first batch of contaminated melatonin surface? I'll bet a few in <br>
pharmaceutical sleeping pill industry have their fingers crossed.<br>
<p>
They also banned the herb comfrey because one woman who was taking about<br>
a dozen prescription drugs and comfrey died of liver cancer. When will <br>
the next person taking green tea die of liver cancer?  Yet thousands<br>
die every year from FDA approved prescription drugs -- no big deal.<br>
<p>
So the precedent is set, with virtually no sign of protest, for <br>
the govt to take away items under the slightest pretext. <br>
