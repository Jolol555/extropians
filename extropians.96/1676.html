About an hour ago, I was having a fairly heated argument with some people I <br>
know, about gun control and whether it's best to respect people's freedom to <br>
defend themselves using deadly weapons or whether it's best to attempt to <br>
forcefully disarm everyone and allow no guns to exist.  I won't go into the <br>
details of the argument, because that's not what I want to talk about.  After <br>
the argument, I went into my room, sat down, closed my eyes and began <br>
reviewing everything, processing the event over and over, looking for the <br>
basic assumptions that people were making, which were revealed by what they <br>
brought up in the argument.  <br>
<p>
I realized (with some amazement that I'd never noticed it before) that people <br>
were assuming that the way to solve social problems is by making some kind of <br>
law.  That was such a basic assumption, that the issue was about what kind of <br>
laws we should make, rather than whether we could solve the problems better by <br>
trying solutions which didn't require government and laws at all.  We just <br>
assumed that the problem (of gun violence) should be handled by the <br>
government.  It was an automatic assumption, which nobody questioned.<br>
<p>
Now I realize how widespread this assumption is.  People automatically assume <br>
that the way to stop people from doing things which are wrong (criminal <br>
activity) is to outlaw the activity.  It's generally not even questioned; <br>
people just assume that we have to outlaw those activities which are wrong.  <br>
It's such a basic assumption; "of course those things should be against the <br>
law," and people think that not making criminal activity against the law is <br>
saying that it's okay to do.  But the real point is not whether we make <br>
criminal activity illegal by making laws against it, but whether we actually <br>
succeed in reducing or eliminating violent and other coercive activities, <br>
whether they're officially declared "against the law" or not.<br>
<p>
I don't see how having a group of legislators declare that murder and robbery <br>
are officially illegal will actually reduce these activities.  It's just a <br>
statement they're making.  Now if other people decide to enforce that <br>
statement, that may make a difference in the frequency of these activities.  <br>
But won't people defend themselves from criminals, even if the legislators <br>
hadn't declared that what the criminals were doing was officially "against the <br>
law"?  If it wasn't illegal for someone to murder or rob you, would you just <br>
sit back and let them do it?<br>
<p>
This is such a basic assumption, that we need laws, and I'm questioning it.  <br>
I'm not necessarily saying that we don't need laws -- I'm not denying the <br>
assumption; I simply questioning it.  I'm not convinced that we really need <br>
laws for people to work and live together peacefully.  I'm not convinced that <br>
we don't need laws either, but I'm questioning that very basic assumption <br>
which most people make without really thinking about it.<br>
<p>
So, let's imagine a world with no human laws at all, a world where people <br>
never consider making laws to solve their problems.  Imagine these people are <br>
very similar to us; they have the same social problems we do; they have <br>
violent people murdering, raping, robbing and doing all kinds of destructive <br>
things, just like we do, but they simply would never try to solve their <br>
problems by making laws.  What kind of strategies could they use to solve <br>
their problems, without resorting to making laws?<br>
<p>
The people don't WANT to be robbed or raped or murdered or abused in any way, <br>
any more than we do.  So, they're very eager to find some effective solutions <br>
to their problems.  How can they protect themselves?  Simply declaring that <br>
certain activities are forbidden seems pretty ineffective to these people, so <br>
they dismiss the idea very quickly.  They are each very aware of the <br>
particular activities that are intolerable to them personally, and they each <br>
wish to avoid encountering people who engage in these activities.  But the <br>
question is, how can they do this?  <br>
<p>
This question is facing us also.  For all of our history, we have had <br>
criminals and other social problems.  Humans have attempted various solutions <br>
to these problems, with varying degrees of success.  Often they created <br>
governments in an attempt to solve social problems, and often these very <br>
governments became corrupted and powerful and became much worse of a problem <br>
than anything they were created to solve.  Most people seem to unquestioningly <br>
assume that laws and government will solve our problems, but the evidence <br>
indicates strongly that that approach does not work.  The problems have not <br>
been solved at all.  <br>
<p>
It seems to be a basic feature of most humans that they will develop an <br>
irrational faith in something and keep sticking with it in spite of all <br>
evidence against it.  They have so much faith that governments will actually <br>
work, that they will actually solve our problems, even though they never have <br>
before, and they are not doing so now.  But people want to believe so badly <br>
that somehow it will work this time, and they keep trying and failing, over <br>
and over.<br>
<p>
I think it's time to step back and look at the situation again and re-evaluate <br>
our approaches.  What we've been doing, clearly isn't working.  It would be <br>
insane to keep trying the same failed approach.  <br>
<p>
As Extropians, we are interested in creating a better future.  We are <br>
interested in finding solutions to our problems.  Death is a problem for us, <br>
and we're working on solving it.  Having limited resources and abilities is a <br>
problem, in our opinions, and we are working on overcoming all of our <br>
limitations.  People committing violence upon each other is also a problem we <br>
are concerned with, and I think it is very important that we find some real, <br>
effective solutions to this problem.  Government, as we know it, isn't <br>
working.  The problems remain, seemingly undiminished.  We need to find <br>
solutions that work, for a change.  We need to seriously question the <br>
irrational faith in government solutions.<br>
<p>
I don't know exactly what solutions would be effective in eliminating violent <br>
and other coercive activities, but I do know that what people are doing now <br>
doesn't seem to be effective at all.  Violence and all other forms of coercion <br>
are highly Entropic activities, and eliminating these sorts of activities is a <br>
high priority for most, if not all, Extropians.<br>
<p>
I encourage more discussion in this forum about possible solutions to the <br>
problems of violence and other coercive activity.  How can we practically and <br>
effectively eliminate these types of activities?  This is a very difficult and <br>
complex problem; humans have been pondering it for millennia.  But we have <br>
many advantages our ancestors did not.  First of all, we have their mistakes <br>
to review.  We have more people with intelligent minds working on the problem. <br>
 We have much greater knowledge.  We can communicate our possible solutions to <br>
each other quickly and easily.  <br>
<p>
I am optimistic that we will eventually overcome the problems of violence and <br>
other coercive activities, just as I am optimistic that we will eventually <br>
overcome the problem of death.  But we must share our ideas with each other <br>
and build on each other's ideas.  We need to think seriously about these <br>
problems and discuss our thoughts with each other.<br>
