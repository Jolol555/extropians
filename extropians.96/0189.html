<i>&gt;Nietzsche scholars, correct me if I'm wrong;  but I think Nietzsche was</i><br>
<i>&gt;referring to the Russians, not the Germans, when he coined the</i><br>
<i>&gt;expression "Blonde Beast."  Does anyone recall the original context for</i><br>
<i>&gt;this?</i><br>
<p>
He was referring to European barbarians in general. (I think the citation<br>
would be THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, but I'm not sure.) Since one of<br>
Nietzsche's pet peeves was the destruction of classical civilization by the<br>
Christians and the ancient Germans, he probably had the ancient Germans in<br>
mind. But the phrase was also quite definitely intended to bring to mind<br>
the image of a lion, a connotation that has been mostly lost since the<br>
1940s. For those of you who have a copy of Zarathustra handy, the chapter<br>
"The Three Metamorphoses" may make clearer what sort of image and cultural<br>
role Nietzsche had in mind.<br>
<p>
He was very definitely using the word in a value-free sense, neither<br>
approving nor disapproving, but rather analyzing. The context is his<br>
contrast of master morality with slave morality, the blond beast being<br>
associated with the former. A very common mistake in Nietzsche<br>
interpretation is to think that Nietzsche preferred master morality to<br>
slave morality; in fact, he condemned both as narrow-minded. The mistake, I<br>
think, results from Nietzsche's hatred of Christianity, which led him to<br>
condemn slave morality at considerably greater length than master morality,<br>
which he already knew most of his audience would condemn on their own.<br>
(Would that he had taken greater care to prevent the misinterpretations of<br>
the proto-Nazi minority!)<br>
<p>
You go on to talk about what enabled Europe to "conquer the world" in the<br>
18th and 19th centuries. This is certainly very far from N's context.<br>
Nietzsche was a classics scholar, and what he was fretting about most of<br>
the time was not the ability of civilized 19th-century Europeans to<br>
dominate other cultures, but rather the much more worrisome ability of<br>
uncivilized German barbarians and superstitious Christian rabble to destroy<br>
classical civilization. (Me, I blame the Romans, but I've probably just<br>
been unduly influenced by Petr Beckmann.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Andray also writes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Several people of my acquaintance seem bothered by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; neo-Nietzschean subtext in a lot of Extropian rhetoric,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What rhetoric are you referring to?  I don't recall seeing any such</i><br>
<i>&gt;rhetoric on the list.  I'm the only one here (as far as I can tell) who is</i><br>
<i>&gt;seriously unhappy with the PC world we live in.  I have never been a</i><br>
<i>&gt;spokesman for Extropianism, and in any case I'm not going to be here</i><br>
<i>&gt;much longer.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't worry about it. Most serious philosophers nowadays (including<br>
such bastions of transatlantic socialism as Richard Rorty) are deeply<br>
indebted to Nietzsche, and few serious thinkers worry themselves overmuch<br>
about the Nazi caricature that springs to most people's minds when they<br>
think "Nietzsche". Kaufmann's books are widely available if anyone wishes<br>
to disabuse themselves of this caricature.<br>
<p>
If you're not going to be around here much longer, you'll be missed. There<br>
are too few strong challenges around here, and though you aren't always on<br>
the mark, you've come up with some good ones.<br>
