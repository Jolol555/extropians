It is very refreshing to hear other people saying these things. I have always<br>
believed that the effect of EOC (and now the singularity idea) on the eventual<br>
success of cryonics has been a mixed blessing, at best, and perhaps an overall<br>
negative. The reason that I decided to put all my efforts into promoting the<br>
success of cryonics instead of direct life-extension (which I avidly pursue<br>
personally) or nanotechnology (which would have been much more "fun", given my<br>
background in engineering, math and physics), is precisely because so little<br>
was being done and achieved in the area of cryonics (even in comparison to<br>
life-extension and nanotechnology which I grant are grossly underfunded and<br>
understaffed).<br>
<p>
IMO, I do not exaggerate what others have stated, when I say that it is<br>
*insane* for anyone who sincerely wants to *see* this wonderful future which<br>
everyone on this list is so keen to *talk* about, to sit back and do virtually<br>
nothing to promote cryonics and to see that less damaging cryopreservation<br>
methods are found. This is especially true *because* of the extreme lack of<br>
prior research on suspended animation. The science of this area is so little<br>
charted that it may even turn out to be quite easy to do cryogenic suspended<br>
animation. All we have to do is to find the right combination of chemicals to<br>
use for the cryoprotective agent. The vast majority of such even reasonable<br>
combinations haven't been assessed. And let me remind everyone for the<br>
millionth time (and even Merkle agrees) -- we have no proof (and therefore it<br>
may be false) that *anyone* cryopreserved by present techniques is coming back<br>
with *any* of their mental faculties intact. Furthermore, we shall *have* no<br>
such proof until something like the Prometheus Project is accomplished.<br>
<p>
Currently, I *am* signed up, and doing and promoting cryonics research. And I<br>
am pursuing a calorie restricted, mega-nutrient eating-style which my studies<br>
indicate is the best that I can currently do to forestall the aging of my body.<br>
<p>
BTW, if anyone is interested in calorie restriction (still the most "proven"<br>
method) as a method of increasing your lifespan, you might like to subscribe to<br>
