OK, so all this talk about checklists and stuff is converging with an<br>
intention I've had for a long time to get more organized.  I tried a<br>
day-timer a couple years ago, but the limitations of paper just got me<br>
frustrated.  So I'm looking for an electronic organizer, one that I<br>
can write into, and that will sync with my PowerMac at home and my NT<br>
PC at work.<br>
<p>
It looks like the two choices are the Newton (a friend loves his 130,<br>
and the upcoming 2000 (?) will kick it's ass), and the Pilot.  These<br>
two are very different creatures.  The Newton is big and heavy and can<br>
do everything (e.g., the new one will come with mail reader/web<br>
browser, and can use the Ricochet wireless Net modem).  Since I'm soon<br>
to be spending lots of time driving around the Bay Area, having the<br>
GPS card option with navigation software would be a big win.  The<br>
Pilot is tiny and limited but I could put it in my pocket and forget<br>
about it.<br>
<p>
The question is: if I buy the Newton, will I haul it around, and if I<br>
buy the Pilot, will it do everything I want?<br>
<p>
Anyone here have experiences with these two boxes?<br>
<p>
Maybe I need both. . .<br>
