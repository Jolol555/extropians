Ask not what your brand name can do for you, <br>

No, anarchy means no authority. We had industrial laissez faire before,<br>
and more damage was done to people and planet in that brief 100 years than<br>
any time period preceding. <br>

<p>
If you really want to get down to it, nobody has any rights. Your vaunted<br>
claim that ownerships is a right is just really just as "invalid" as my<br>
claim that people have the right to have a say in matters that affect<br>
them. Any social system is based on defining what rights which people<br>
have. You take the right of ownership and assign it to everybody, so you<br>
can take it away.  <br>
<p>
It has no institutionalized authority. Which I see has having no<br>
government.<br>
<p>

Not so. You can have hordes and hordes of them, all over. If you don't<br>
like one, leave, join another, or start your own. Of course, if you run a<br>
repressive one, then nobody will join you as there are egalitarian and<br>
free systems as alternatives.<br>

<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Yes. You can. What are they going to do about it? But you better figure<br>
out a better way to earn your food. It's completely voluntary. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Terrific! The consumers can vote for higher quality, lower prices and less </i><br>
<i>&gt; pollution. The workers can vote for higher wages, more time off, and better  </i><br>
<i>&gt; health care. It's paradise, everybody's happy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Please, do you really have that kind of disrespect for people. I'm sure<br>
people, when given the information, can make reasonable decisions based on<br>
circumstance. When people understand the problems, they will solve them.<br>
While government today hoards it's knowledge and says "we know what's<br>
best", a democratic system depends on everybody having access to the<br>
information. I don't think the consumers will vote for cheaper products if<br>
they realize that the workers can't afford to feed themselves as a<br>
result.  <br>
