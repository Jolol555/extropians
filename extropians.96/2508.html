I never said sex was holy - you said that.  <br>
I look forward to enhancing intimacy and cherish <br>
it for its own sake.  Here and now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Sex is an artefact of evolution, tailored to fulfill its range of tasks </i><br>
(mostly, autoreplication) it was designed to do. Period. <br>
<p>
<p>
Ok,  you have determined sex is purely for procreation.<br>
I see no supporting argument, but even with one:<br>
 So what? Do you have a problem with other people<br>
enjoying sex? Valuing it?  You dont value it, OK, <br>
don't have it, but is your criteria for advancement the "correct", hence only<br>
available one for me? For all?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
Once the entire background situation changes qualitatively, sex is obsolete.<br>
Trying to perpetuate sex, particularly to drag along sex in an upload <br>
mind ecology all the way up to Omega, is, sorry to say it, simply <br>
ludicrous.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Eugene, sex is a rather enjoyable part of being human.<br>
Your response is understood, and I must point out it<br>
has nothing to  do with my post. Dragging something <br>
into other people's uploads has never been my thing.<br>
The original response was addressing the type of <br>
addictive sex Rich mentioned, and his use of<br>
the word transcend. I suggested intergrating it to <br>
a more balanced process. <br>
I wasnt talking about posthumans, BTW, but while <br>
we are on the subject,  if one could manage to keep<br>
some kind of intimacy linked to a chemical response, <br>
it might enhance an upload's pleasure and real time communication. We may<br>
chose to include sensory " anachronisms" in ourselves to  keep some "human" <br>
in posthumanity ( those who desire it).. see it as an option.<br>
You can skip that software.<br>
: )  Anyway, I assume pleasure will be different for each individual. <br>
