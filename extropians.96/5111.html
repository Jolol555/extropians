The increase in gun shot wounds occured in the US during the same period =<br>
that gun laws became steadily more restrictive.  Hard to see any =<br>
correlation in variables here.  The variables that increased during this =<br>
period were the welfare state and the War on Drugs.  Destruction of the =<br>
African American family also occured during this period.  Now 70% of =<br>
African American children are born out of wedlock and the now the =<br>
"White" illegitimacy rate is skyrocketing also.  America had very low =<br>
gun shot wound rates until the about the 1960's.<br>
<p>
The American welfare state is especially adept at destroying families.  =<br>
I'll bet welfare is handled differently in European socialism.  Or maybe =<br>
the difference lies in greater social cohesion because of fewer minority =<br>
groups?  Or less intense pursuit of the War on Drugs?  Perhaps the =<br>
American tax system that encourage Suburban sprawl leaving the =<br>
underclass fighting among themselves in abandoned inner cities? =20<br>
