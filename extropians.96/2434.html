 It's not even clear that the profit per unit would be higher if vitamins <br>
 were prescription drugs.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The USP regulations for prescription drugs is a lot more expensive than the<br>
USP regulations for OTC nutritional supplements.  The profit might drop<br>
because of this if vitamins were under the Rx drug regulations.  Every year<br>
the OTC regulations seem to get more expensive.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Nobody has a patent on vitamins.   Most <br>
 doctors would prescribe the cheapest generic vitamins they could find.  <br>
 This is exactly the kind of situation pharmaceutical companies want to <br>
 avoid.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
My pharmaceutical clients could make and sell vitamins right now.  Yet, they<br>
do not make any vitamins.  Why?  They assume the FDA would place the same<br>
expensive regulations on their OTC vitamins as on their Rx drugs despite the<br>
USP.  And, they could not charge higher prices to offset the cost.  So, they<br>
choose not to make any OTC vitamins.    If all vitamins were Rx, that could<br>
change.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;   They can make a lot more money selling vitamins over the <br>
 counter than they would make selling them by prescription.    &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I am unclear if this is true or not.  Let's see:  Generic Rx makes a lot of<br>
profit but only if the drug is unusual or hard to make and therefore, there<br>
is less competition from other generics.  So, I guess if vitamins are easy to<br>
make even under Rx regulations there would probably still be more competition<br>
and less profit than selling them OTC.  You are probably right.  <br>
<p>
The innovators (patent holders) would be out of the picture, because there<br>
are none for vitamins.<br>
