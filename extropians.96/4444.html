<i>&gt;Ever played 'Doom'? I know it's not real, but I've still spent days in</i><br>
<i>&gt;that universe and had a lot of fun in the process. I can't prove that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe I'm in now is 'real', but I still have fun here.</i><br>
<p>
True you can still have fun but can you really use doom or quake as a<br>
source of inspiration? This makes me interested in what inspires the many<br>
artists on this list and what their 'creative needs' or environments would<br>
be in an uploaded universe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; It would be very nearly impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; contact someone with a higher speed than you which means that the poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would have a more difficult time climbing to the top and have to steal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; timeslices.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually it would be easier because the faster AIs could commuicate with </i><br>
<i>&gt;several slow AIs simultaneously.</i><br>
<p>
Yes but would they really want to? What would they have to offer that more<br>
advanced uploaded beings wouldn't have access to? Another thing, I refer to<br>
AIs as uploaded or digital beings because this helps present them as<br>
'people' rather than 'processes'.<br>
