<p>
The way I (and I would say Vinge) uses the word, it refers to a hostile <br>
or at least involuntary takeover. The reasons might be benign, as in "True <br>
Names", but it is still something that the owners of the resources <br>
haven't agreed on. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, that depends on the possibility to self-augment using computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resources. While computer security is full of holes everywhere, it isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that bad - cracking into computers to get more computing power is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-trivial and takes time, even for an SI. The idea that a sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; smart being could crack everything is a myth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This depends strongly on how intelligent the SI becomes. Breaking into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; system is reputed to require intelligence and persistence. Frequently, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; clever idea can reduce the amount of brute-force computing needed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; solve a security problem. If the "True Names" augmentation scenario is </i><br>
<i>&gt; valid, then the SI will become progressively more capable of generating the</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate clever ideas. </i><br>
<p>
Note that you base this on the word "frequently", which is a doubtful<br>
assumption (do we have any data on how computer intrusion "usually"<br>
happens?). Usually these clever ideas are creative and involve<br>
non-computer tools such as physical break in, phone calls to trick users<br>
into revealing information or the ability to look through discarded<br>
documentation. In a future information-dominated world, this would be<br>
simpler, but security would also be higher. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Clearly the proper strategy is to start by acquiring the</i><br>
<i>&gt; (nearly) undefended systems, then using them to augment the SI to let it</i><br>
<i>&gt; acquire the slightly better-defended systems, and so forth. </i><br>
<p>
The problem is that the SI cannot use the systems 100%, since that would <br>
be too obvious and they would be shut down. So it would have a lot of <br>
computers running very small processes of itself, with noticeable delays <br>
over the net - this would limit it considerably. And it would have a hard <br>
time keeping track of all the risks: one system administrator who <br>
discovers the SI infiltration could do it a lot of harm if he (for <br>
example) call other administrators and they agree on shutting down their <br>
systems or spread a "viruskiller". <br>
<p>
Actually, I have been thinking of making a computer or strategy game of <br>
this SI scenario; the players are SI's trying to take over the internet <br>
and transcend. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Many system are</i><br>
<i>&gt; essentially undefended, because the perceived cost of a penetration is</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than the system administrator's perceived cost of defending the </i><br>
<i>&gt; system. As a quick reality check on this, when  did you last change </i><br>
<i>&gt; your password? Is your new password a combination of your spouse's initials </i><br>
<i>&gt; and digits from your telephone number?</i><br>
<p>
:-) Fortunately, my password is not that simple. It is guessable, but you <br>
have to make some odd intuitive leaps and do some research to get it. But <br>
as you point out, there are big holes in many systems. But are they <br>
enough to provide a base for an useful SI in a reasonable time?<br>
