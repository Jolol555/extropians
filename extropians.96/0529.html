<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Max, I would be *ESPECIALLY* grateful if you spared a little time to post</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; one of your excellent messages to the newsgroup to help stir up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; conversation. Or perhaps you could convince Wade Cherrington to post!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;-- End of quoted excerpt from Chris Hind</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Why not write Wade Cherrington yourself and ask?  Max is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"central extropian authority".  If you can convince Wade with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the authority of your own argument, I'm sure he'll post.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why are you taking such offense? I'm asking politely. I only aimed my</i><br>
<i>&gt; message to Max because he is our public spokesperson/representative where</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mass media is concerned.</i><br>
<p>
No, he's not.  He's one of a number of people with opinions, often<br>
called upon to express them.  A number of us have done that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Every group MUST have a leader to inspire the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mindless lemmingish masses.</i><br>
<p>
I can't believe you really mean that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That is until people become more educated via</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.</i><br>
<p>
How?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the eyes of the public as yet, Max is the "central extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority".</i><br>
<p>
No, he isn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ok, Fine I'll ask Wade myself but mainly because I REALLY want</i><br>
<i>&gt; him to post and also because Max is SOOO busy which I later realized. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason I asked Max to tell him to post is because I believe Max could help</i><br>
<i>&gt; inspire him because he enjoys Wade's posts so much.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- End of quoted excerpt from Chris Hind</i><br>
<p>
A number of us enjoyed Wade's post.  Again, why not ask him yourself?<br>
