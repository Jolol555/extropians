<i>&gt; Lyle, please do not quit the list. </i><br>
<p>
Well, where do we go from here?  It's not just Eliezer that bothers me.  <br>
He is a much more reasonable correspondent than some other people  <br>
we have had on the list.  <br>
<p>
There are actually two problems.  One is that I find myself among <br>
believers who want to propagate their meme, and I have zero interest   <br>
in this.  I am not comfortable in such an environment.  The second <br>
problem is that the list is set up in such a way that there are built-in <br>
limits to what can be discussed.  Only so much can be done in a <br>
letter-to-the-editor format.  Trying to present a multi-step argument <br>
on the list is like trying to hold water in a sieve.  <br>
<p>
I think it is possible to prove that AI is an illusion, that molecular <br>
manufacturing is nonsense, and that whatever happens will emerge <br>
continuously from what is happening now -- i.e. there will be no <br>
Singularity.  In my posts since last March I have indicated why I think <br>
this is the case.  The next step is to construct a formal argument.  <br>
This is a non-trivial task, like proving Goedel's theorems or Turing's <br>
theorems, and I don't think this is the time or the place to do it.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If this was just for yacking, I would not waste another minute here, </i><br>
<i>&gt; as I have vastly more important things to do ... Things like, bringing </i><br>
<i>&gt; about a new type of propulsion technology for spacecraft.  </i><br>
<p>
What exactly do you expect to see on the list, if not more yakking?  <br>
It's going to go on for another five years, and then another five...  <br>
New people will join the list, who aren't aware of what has gone <br>
before, and they will go around the same circles again and again.  <br>
Along the way some really good ideas will come up, such as the remark <br>
by Twirlip of Greymist -- "All undamaged human beings, and other <br>
sentiences, share the same area of comprehensibility."   The fact <br>
that such gems occur is one reason why it's so hard to leave the list.  <br>
I know I'm going to miss a lot.  But even the good ideas are <br>
just yakking, in the sense that they are forgotten after a few weeks.  <br>
Everything on the list disappears into a void.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Secondly, this list is not just a caffe clatch for armchair philosophers, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but a forum for communication and coordination of our efforts to </i><br>
<i>&gt; actively help bring about the technologies ... needed to attain a </i><br>
<i>&gt; positive transhuman shift.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I wish!  But (1) there is very little discussion of how to bring <br>
about new technologies, (2) there is no way to filter out the other 50 to <br>
100 messages that appear on the list every day, and (3) the technologies <br>
that are discussed here are not the ones needed for the transhuman shift.  <br>
Biology is the key to &gt;H.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, it's hard to say much about new technologies without <br>
giving away secrets.  <br>
<p>
I propose a race:  I think I can construct a working nanobattery before <br>
you can construct a working Lorrey drive.  (And I think I have *plenty* <br>
of time to build my battery  ;-)  Then, when we are finished, we can <br>
talk about how we did it.  <br>
<p>
In the meantime, we should work, not yak. <br>
<p>
