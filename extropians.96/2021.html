Chris Hind:<br>
&lt;Why deny the fact that emotion is vestigial and only for mere<br>
entertainment now that we have logic?&gt;<br>
<p>
Michael Butler:<br>
&lt;Eliminate dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine from my<br>
system, take out all the endocrine substances that are not currently<br>
known to act as neurotransmitters -- I doubt that I'd feel like doing<br>
anything at all, even think.&gt;<br>
<p>
David D.:<br>
&lt;I wouldn't mind volunteering for that experiment. But without<br>
experiment we'll never know. Emotion might be to<br>
extropian/transhumanists as the genes that produce fetal hemoglobin are<br>
to adult humans. Worthy at one time, but now, so much garbage.&gt;<br>
<p>
As Anders likes to sometimes say, "It's a little more subtle than that<br>
..."<br>
<p>
Thalamus damage seems central to some comas.  The thalamus being a<br>
mid-brain structure and the central relay station in memory retrieval.<br>
Also, the brain stem, particularly the reticular activating system, is<br>
essential for attention.  The midbrain structures are primarily<br>
dopamine-driven while the brainstem structures are primarily<br>
serotonin-driven.<br>
<p>
It might be that these neurotransmitters and endocrine substances are<br>
_somewhat_ like the software elements of the brain, compared to the<br>
hardware of the neural circuitry. Which of these 'essential nutrients'<br>
would you chose to give up first in your quest to become a 'Vulcan'?<br>
<p>
On the other hand, coma cases, as well as the less extreme cases of<br>
autism, or even experiments with ones own brain chemistry (want to try<br>
some ketamine?), can perhaps tell us much about what we may expect to<br>
occur in the first uploaded human minds (where there is not yet a<br>
sophisticated artificial reality for them to live in) or minds that have<br>
primarily sealed themselves off their own virtual reality 'basement<br>
universes' or 'dungeons'.<br>
