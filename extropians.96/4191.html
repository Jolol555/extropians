I don't have access to whatever Brin wrote that started this off, <br>
so I may be missing the point, but here's my tuppence-ha'penny worth anyway.<br>
<p>
I don't see any conflict at all between privacy and transparency; <br>
it's purely up to the individual to decide whether or not his or her <br>
dealings with the world be open or private.  Of course if you're <br>
talking about what a government should do, that's a different, and <br>
more difficult question. Broadly, it isn't the government's place to <br>
'encourage' either mode particularly, and government itself (where any!) should be <br>
largely transparent, except (surely obviously) with regard to <br>
sensitive military matters.<br>
<p>
We normally observe the world and remember things we've observed.  <br>
You can't hide from people.<br>
Extropians should have no problem with enhancements that allow people <br>
to observe better and remember better.  This alone would mean more <br>
transparency generally, with something like Brin's policing grannies <br>
vision coming about as a matter of course.  Heinlein conceived <br>
something similar with his notion of the 'fair witness' too, did he <br>
not?<br>
<p>
I quite fancy that it will soon be possible to have a wearable, <br>
unobtrusive and powerful personal computer with miniature digital video camera and sound recording <br>
equipment attached, ongoingly recording say the past 15 minutes or so <br>
of one's experience (so that one could 'capture' it or 'sample' it to <br>
disk at the touch of a button).  This would be a really useful tool<br>
for people who wished to keep an eye on things.  Especially police <br>
shenanigans.<br>
<p>
Again, I stress that Extropians should have no problem with this, as<br>
it is simply an extension of the observer's own experience and<br>
memory.<br>
<p>
BTW, did anybody read the recent article in Wired on this very <br>
subject?  The writer thought that since Big Surveillance Technology was coming <br>
anyway, far better that we watch each other than that we have Big <br>
Brother watching us.<br>
<p>
As for encryption, the usual arguments apply: it is obviously very useful, and the <br>
arguments against it invoking the Three Horsemen of the Infocalypse <br>
(child pornographers, terrorists and I forget the other one) are <br>
irrelevant.  Hard cases make bad law.<br>
