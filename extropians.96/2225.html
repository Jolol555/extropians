<p>
Hrmmph!!!  Since when has the scientific method been able to say anything<br>
about "ownership"?  By all means let's discuss ownership, but please leave<br>
science out of it.  It's not within its scope.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Earth owns us all, the galaxy </i><br>
<i>&gt; owns the Earth, and the Universe the galaxy.</i><br>
<p>
No it doesn't.  The great power-being Polkadot The Meaningful owns<br>
everything.  So there!  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But at the smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; end of things, "I" own my body, or my body owns my body, because </i><br>
<i>&gt; my body controls itself. Or more clearly, my body owns itself</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the degree that it controls itself. By extension, my body</i><br>
<i>&gt; owns those things in its external area that it controls,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or manipulates. In this sense "ownership" is not "a </i><br>
<i>&gt; hilariously ridiculous notion" as you suggest.</i><br>
<p>
I'm afraid it is.  "Ownership" is meaningless except as an accommodation<br>
between people.  If you were my slave then I would "own" your body<br>
despite the control you have over it.  There really isn't any future in<br>
reasoned argument about intrinsic rights of ownership, because the whole<br>
area is founded on a figment without substance outside of human society.<br>
<p>
Yes, it's a useful concept in society today, like God was for thousands<br>
of years.  However, there is only partial intersection between the sets<br>
of what is useful and of what has substance in the universe.<br>
