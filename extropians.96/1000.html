If 2 electrons in a atom are in a very large orbit they must have a very small <br>
velocity. According to the uncertainty principle, the better you know the <br>
velocity of something the less you know its position. In this case we know a <br>
lot about the electron's velocity (very close to zero) so we know little about<br>
its position. The effective size of these electrons would be huge, they would <br>
overlap, when we measure the spin of an electron we can't be certain which <br>
electron we are measuring so the "message" would be random. <br>
                             <br>
It has been shown experimentally that it is possible to change things far <br>
away faster than light, instantly in fact, but that's not enough to sent a <br>
message.  To send a message I must not only change something but the receiver <br>
must be able to compare that change with something, otherwise the message <br>
will look random to him.<br>
         <br>
Some physical processes produce 2 photons that have the same polarization but <br>
move in opposite directions. A billion years before I was born somebody in <br>
the Virgo Cluster started making pairs of photons that have identical but  <br>
unknown polarization. He sent one stream of photons to the earth, a billion  <br>
light years away, he sent another stream of photons to the Coma cluster in  <br>
the opposite direction from the earth a billion and one light years away.  <br>
A billion years later  on Earth I spin my polarizer to a random direction,  <br>
record the position, observe if the photon made it through the detector or  <br>
not, then record that too. Now I spin the polarizer again and do the same  <br>
thing for the next photon and then for the next several thousand  photons.  <br>
I know that a year from now a friend of mine in the Coma Cluster will  <br>
perform the exact same experiment on his stream of photons and I decide to  <br>
visit him. I get in a space  ship with my records and blast off for the Coma  <br>
Cluster at 99% of the speed of light.<br>
<p>
After 2 billion years I arrive in the Coma Cluster and compare notes with my  <br>
friend. I notice that the direction I had my polarizer turned to and the   <br>
direction my friend had his turned to were different, not very surprising  <br>
since both were picked at random, but then I find something astounding.  <br>
The square of the cosign of the angle between the 2 detectors for each photon <br>
pair is proportional to the probability that a photon will make it through my  <br>
friend's detector.<br>
<p>
I have instantly changed something that is 2 billion light years away and was  <br>
made long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Pretty weird. Unfortunately this  <br>
effect can not be used for faster than light communication because before I  <br>
arrived with my records the results of my friend's experiment looked random  <br>
to him, it's only when he compared his results with my records, and that can <br>
only be done at the speed of light or less, did it become obvious that turning  <br>
my polarizer and observing the results instantly changed his photons far away.   <br>
Nevertheless this does have a practical benefit, you can use it to make a <br>
communication link that is absolutely secure, it's already been done, but I <br>
wrote about  Quantum Cryptography in another post.<br>
