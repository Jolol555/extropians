I wrote <br>
<i>&gt; There are many points where a decision has to be made</i><br>
<i>&gt; by somebody who has an understanding of the project as a whole, </i><br>
<p>
to which John Clark replied, <br>
<i>&gt; Then complex things would never get made by humans. </i><br>
<i>&gt; No one man, no ten men have a deep understanding of an airliner </i><br>
<i>&gt; or a microprocessor or the software that lets it do interesting things, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's too great for one mind to grasp, at least a mind as puny as a human. </i><br>
<p>
John, if you uploaded yourself into better hardware, you would just <br>
miss the point a hundred times faster.  <br>
<p>
The rest of my statement --  <br>
<i>&gt; ...and who understands the purpose of his activity.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such decisions require human judgment.  </i><br>
<p>
to which John replied: <br>
<i>&gt; The purpose of his activity is to make money, but that's </i><br>
<i>&gt; even more complex than manufacturing because not even a billion men </i><br>
<i>&gt; understands the economy in any depth.  </i><br>
<p>
This is very boring.  <br>
<p>
