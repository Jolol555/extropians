<i>&gt;        I really think age is irrelevant on this list.  For one, the list is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a forum for extropian conversation; I have a feeling some peoples' views may</i><br>
<i>&gt;be frowned upon by others if they know the poster's age.</i><br>
<p>
I was only curious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If there was a 15</i><br>
<i>&gt;year-old on this list, some members might think that that person had not</i><br>
<i>&gt;experienced the world or had not been involved enough to know anything about</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropianism.</i><br>
<p>
Most of what we discuss on this list is book learned anyways and life<br>
experience plays a small part due to it's subjective quality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  On the other side of the spectrum, if there was a 75 year-old</i><br>
<i>&gt;on this list, members might feel that he\she has no chance of uploading,</i><br>
<i>&gt;therefore his\her views are inconsequential.</i><br>
<p>
Of course they'd need to rule out the chance of uploading to look upon them<br>
as such.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but past experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;has shown me how judgmental people tend</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be when faced with an age.</i><br>
<p>
Then they're obviously not extropians or transhumans.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  As long as their topics are extropian, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't care if there were 10 year-olds on the list.  Enough said!</i><br>
<p>
I completely agree. More power to the person if they can convince older people!<br>
