"We've had this conversation before, so I'm fairly sure I won't convince you<br>

binary is/is-not pairing and then suddenly assert that each member of that<br>
pairing is the same, invalidating your own pair-dichotomy. Huh?"<br>
<p>
I'll shout for Sarah's corner (at least I think I am.  Please correct me, <br>
Sarah, if you disagree).<br>
<p>
This reminds me of the logical "paradox" that a certain bunch of people get <br>
off on.  They have several ways of stating it.  Here's one:<br>
<p>
(a) Sentence 'b' is true.<br>
(b) Sentence 'a' is false.<br>
<p>
Is sentence 'a' true or false?<br>
<p>
Now, they enjoy watching people squirm, trying to figure it out, because if <br>
it's true, then it's validating sentence 'b' which says it's false, and if <br>
it's false, then sentence 'b' is true and that's exactly what sentence 'a' is <br>
saying, so it can't be false.  But it can't be true either.<br>
<p>
This is analagous to presenting someone with a red box and asking, "Is this <br>
box black or white?"  Of course, it's neither black nor white, it's red, which <br>
is something else altogether.  <br>
<p>
And, likewise, sentence 'a' is neither true nor false; it is <br>
self-contradictory (via sentence 'b'), and that is something else altogether.  <br>
The mistake was in assuming that "true" or "false" are the only options for <br>
sentences to be.  Not every sentence is true or false; there are many other <br>
categories of sentences.  But narrow-minded logic only has two categories; <br>
true and false, and it is not adequate to deal with reality, which suggests <br>
many, many categories.<br>
