As I was riding home from my parents' house last night after celebrating <br>
another nice Christmas, I was struck by the bright, full moon shining in <br>
the clear night.  I guess my subconscious thoughts did some some strange <br>
wanderings, and somewhere along the way the idea popped into my head of <br>
using the Moon as a huge billboard.  This way, some intrepid group of <br>
entrepreneurs could sell advertising space and use the proceeds to fund <br>
the cost of establishing a lunar base.  I envision the billboard as a <br>
huge digital screen, composed of huge banks of displays which form the <br>
equivalent of pixels.  This way the ad could be changed as often as <br>
necessary to maximize the number of corporate sponsors.<br>
<p>
Of course the thought has its aesthetic drawbacks; after all, who wants <br>
to look up, as I did last night, and see a commercial that you can't get <br>
rid of?  On the other hand, with reports of the Japanese planning a lunar <br>
expedition and Chinese astronauts training with Russians, how long would <br>
it be until we look up and see a huge Sony logo or a picture of Chairman <br>
Mao?  I figure a bunch of capitalists may as well beat them to the punch. <br>
 After all, as anyone who's read "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" knows, <br>
whoever's sitting at the top of the gravity well can pretty much call the <br>
shots.<br>
<p>
I'd be interested in finding out if anyone else has already come up with <br>
plans for this.  Just for kicks, I'd also appreciate your evaluation of <br>
the feasibility of this venture.  For example, how big would the board <br>
need to be to be visible, could we use solar power to power it, etc.<br>
