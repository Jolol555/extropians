<p>
[As far as I can tell, this posting of last night never appeared on the<br>
list. So here it is again. MM]<br>
<p>
This evening, Extropy Institute was offered an opportunity to have its Web<br>
site filmed for a show with an expected audience of 5-10 million. The<br>
filming is to take place next Monday.<br>
<p>
This is a superb opportunity to introduce Extropian ideas to thousands of<br>
web surfers. The challenge here is that Eric and I have been so absorbed<br>
with other projects that we haven't developed the ExI web site yet. Still,<br>
I'm confident that by Monday a mini-Manhattan project can get one minute of<br>
filmable material online. The text is easy. We have some graphics, which is<br>
important for the filming to produce attractive results. But we really could<br>
do with some more suitable graphics.<br>
<p>
THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN HELP!<br>
<p>
We'd really like to show some simple but striking images to get viewers<br>
interested enough (combined with the 2.5 minutes of explaining the ideas) to<br>
check out the site. (The show won't air for several weeks, giving us a<br>
chance to build it up by the time people look at it in detail on the Web.)<br>
Graphics I'd especially like to have for the site:<br>
<p>
     * A 3-D version of the extropy 5-arrow spiral emblem.<br>
<p>
     * An animated gif of the spiral logo (whether 3D or not).<br>
<p>
Obviously we can use for graphics things like covers of Extropy, images from<br>
Natasha Vita More's site, illustrations from Extropy articles, and we can<br>
show links to other sites covering aspects of extropian ideas and technologies.<br>
<p>
If you have other ideas for graphics appropriate to the site, and the means<br>
to implement them, please contact me asap. The latest we could add graphical<br>
contributions to the site would be this Sunday. Earlier than that would make<br>
it easier to integrate them with whatever else we put together. Of course,<br>
you will be credited for graphical contributions.<br>
<p>
If you have graphics on your personal web site of any kind that might<br>
appropriate, we would be delighted to have use of them. This will benefit<br>
your site too, since if you have appropriate material, the ExI site will<br>
have links to your site by the time the TV viewers see the show.<br>
<p>
Time is tight. The opportunity to spread Extropian ideas wider is here.<br>
Please help if you can.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>
<p>
Max<br>
