True.  But the analogy of an immune system is misleading, it implies <br>
that logical thought is somehow above other memes and acts as a <br>
controlling system.  Logic itself is a meme, and it opperates on the <br>
same level as religious memes.  Different maps for different chaps, <br>
different semantic funnels for different reality tunnels. <br>
