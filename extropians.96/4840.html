<i>&gt; I think you're lying, Mike.  I think you are pretending to have evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you don't have.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
All I have is my memories, which remind me that the slides and films I<br>
saw were labeled: US ARMY ARCHIVES. As the government typically keeps<br>
EVERYTHING (just check out the Smithsonian as an example) it logically<br>
follows that such documentaiton would be in the archives still. It was<br>
only 16 years ago that I saw them. You did not state whether or not the<br>
soil samples taken actually showed evidence of toxins.<br>
<p>
here's another question: Since people in the camps who died of normal<br>
malnutrition and disease were buried whole, why would the SS need ovens<br>
to burn just "some" of their victims? Obviously it was to burn away<br>
traces of incriminating substances. According to the testimony of jews<br>
who were detailed to haul the bodies out of the gas chambers and put<br>
them in the ovens, the people were gassed, and the physical<br>
characteristics of their bodies were consistent with deadly exposure to<br>
toxic gasses such as sarin, etc.<br>
<p>
you wonder why there were no doors on the chambers when they were<br>
photographed by US ARMY photographers. That is simple. Since there were<br>
intervals between the time that the camps were abandoned by SS troops<br>
and liberated by US or Russian ARMY troops, typically at least several<br>
days, if not a week or more, there was obviously enough time for the<br>
prisoners to do a bit of revenge motivated vandalism against the symbols<br>
of their extinction: the gas chambers.<br>
<p>
One thing I do not understand Lyle, is why are you making such a big<br>
stink about this on this list? Are you expecting people on this list to<br>
make slips of the tongue that you can then go prancing about claiming we<br>
are all Nazis? Or are you simply trying to obfuscate this list with<br>
ongoing snide remarks intended to piss people off? If either case is<br>
true, I take back my previous remarks about wanting you to remain on the<br>
list.......<br>
