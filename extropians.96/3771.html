I had a long talk at SAB96 with one of the guys who did the GA component<br>
(Peter De Bourcier -- PhD from Sussex in GA)  I've forgotten the exact<br>
details of the chromosome structure (though they were fairly complicated,)<br>
but the beasts struck me as the kind of platform everyone talks about<br>
having -- they have three levels of adaptivity:<br>
<p>
	- genetics by sexual reproduction<br>
	- a 1000 neuron neural network<br>
	- 13 or so biochemical "drives" (including boredom, food, sleep, and<br>
          sex) which on their own provide a very diverse and interesting<br>
          set of behavior.<br>
<p>
You can interact with your beasts as a floating dismembered hand -- you<br>
can pat them on the head to reward them, or slap them to punish them.<br>
You can also teach them words -- they don't have much grammar (2 word<br>
noun verb sentences I think) but it's still pretty convenient.<br>
<p>
They can reenforce each other (positively and negatively) as well, and<br>
you get them teaching each other words, how to eat, etc.  So you can <br>
watch cultural evolution / Baldwin effects as well as genetic evolution.<br>
The things age and die as well as reproduce.<br>
<p>
The "game" part is mostly exploration -- you can only see the environment<br>
through their eyes, which actually I thought was a bit hokey since the<br>
fun part to me is watching the culture.  But then, they're after a broader<br>
market than that I suppose -- they spent 4 years developing the thing, and<br>
the environment is quite fun and pretty if you like that sort of thing.<br>
<p>
There are various toolboxes you can use to watch the stuff like drives<br>
and NN weights -- they are thinking of eventually allowing people to <br>
hack with more of the code, but Peter said he personally wanted to keep<br>
the game standardized for a couple years, because he personally thinks<br>
it's a phenomenally exciting platform and wants to see what evolves with<br>
thousands of people running hours of "experiments."  There's a possibility<br>
of international cross-fertilization between games over the web as well.<br>
<p>
They expect major problems getting the game released in the US because<br>
the little beasts are allowed to be homosexual as well as heterosexual,<br>
and some religous organizations have already informed them they're waiting<br>
outside the court houses to make certain its not released into the American<br>
market, esp. as an educational game.  (I suppose the evolution stuff would<br>
bother them even if the homosexuality didn't!)<br>
