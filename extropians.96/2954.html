I read an interview with a Russian cosmologist a while back in Wired <br>
magazine.  His theory of the universe involves smaller <br>
universes growing off each other randomly, sort of a bubble-fractal <br>
theory of the universe.  The interesting thing about communication <br>
between 'parent' and 'child' universe if that no energy or <br>
information can travel from the parent to the child.  The only way <br>
you can give the child universe any sort of message would be to imbed <br>
the message in the laws of the universe.<br>
