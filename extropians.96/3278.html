I need specifics on that NOW. Actually, I don't. I bet I know what they<br>
were studying, even if they didn't.<br>
<p>
They found that caffeine improves performance on tasks that require<br>
long, linear chains of causality to be worked out.<br>
<p>
But it impaired tasks that required causal analysis, or finding root<br>
causes.<br>
<p>
And it does this... Because caffeine increases your level of mental<br>
energy. It's a minor version of what I described under:<br>
<a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon.html#pearce">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon.html#pearce</a><br>
when I speculated about what the side effects of increased mental energy<br>
would be. I want specifics so I can claim this as a scientific<br>
prediction.<br>
<p>
I'll never drink anything with caffeine in it again. I feel like such a<br>
moron. I should have been able to figure that out from first principles.<br>
I guess I just didn't think about it.<br>
