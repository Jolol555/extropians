<i>&gt;Ace Of Base's 1. album cost 3000 dollars to record. It earned their</i><br>

It might have cost $3000 to record, but they had quite a bit of money to<br>
begin with.  The enormous number of synths (mostly analog) that guy (Olaf?)<br>
owned were probably worth $250,000 alone.  And I understand that he had<br>
something like 6 studios.  I used to be actively involved in the techno<br>
music scene myself and used to own half a 32-track recording studio, and he<br>
had more gear than most techno musicians' best wet dreams.  If I spent that<br>
much money on equipment I would make damn sure I did SOMETHING productive<br>
with it.<br>
