Regarding libertarianism, QueeneMUSE writes:<br>

<p>
This question has certainly been in my mind since I've been actively<br>
contemplating libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism in a more focused fashion<br>
these last couple of years.  Writers on this List and those referred to in<br>
the basic extropian bibliography do two things very well and, to my mind,<br>
convincingly: (1) They use the basic concepts of libertarian<br>
anarcho-capitalism to make cogent analysis and criticism of the current order<br>
and (2) they paint a detailed picture of how a truly anarcho-capitalist<br>
society would function, complete with PPAs/PPLs, reputation agencies and the<br>
like.  The thing that seems to get less attention and seems less well<br>
thought-out is the intermediate realm of getting from number 1 to number 2,<br>
i.e. starting from the world as it is, how an anarcho-capitalist social order<br>
would actually be implemented.<br>
<p>
The development of agoric anarcho-capitalist social orders in truly new<br>
territories isn't that problematic (although it will involve lots of hard<br>
thought and work) and the "getting there from here" issues aren't nearly so<br>
acute in such situations.  The anarchic spontaneous order of the Net seems to<br>
provide a wonderful example of this and I would thus add virtual worlds to<br>
the list of space and ocean "real" territories to which QueenMUSE refers<br>
where the "homesteading" basis of classical liberalism will work for an<br>
initial allocation of property and personal rights.  Establishing a Web<br>
domain is a fine example of this phenomenon in practice.  I make and announce<br>
my place in the Web, others either respect limitations on this space (they<br>
don't hack my pages) or, if they don't, I enforce my rights through<br>
reputation (complaining to the hacker's ISP) and/or increased vigilance and<br>
security measures on my own part (firewalls, counter-hacking retaliation,<br>
etc.).  By and large there is no state action in any of this and, at least so<br>
far, it seems to work just fine.  Whether this agoric order holds up to<br>
increased activity with growing bandwidth, commerce and social life on the<br>
Net will be a fine test of our anarcho-capitalist ideas.<br>
<p>
We all look forward to testing these ideas in the "real" environments to<br>
which QueenMUSE refers.  My current thinking leads me to believe that if and<br>
when groups such as ourselves have the physical ability to migrate to new<br>
"real" environments, we will decide to set out ahead of time basic<br>
contractual constitutions as grounds from which anarcho-capitalist regimes<br>
can spontaneously grow.  As I've written here before, I look to the<br>
"transhumanist diaspora" as a "laboratory of agorics", with different<br>
communities experimenting with different basic constitutions: Some will have<br>
none at all, some will have minimal constitutions, others will have fairly<br>
articulated sets of ground-rules.  Assuming a full-blown Drexlerian<br>
Singularity, the immediate post-Singularity period will thus be a golden age<br>
of constitutional thinking and practice.<br>
<p>
Which leaves the question of what happens to the "real world" that the<br>
"colonists" leave behind.  Do we concentrate on implementing our<br>
anarcho-capitalist ideas in new virtual and real territories and not concern<br>
ourselves with the Old World?  Or do we attempt to develop step-by-step plans<br>
of action to implement these ideas here?  Or is this even necessary? There<br>
appear to be two basic lines on this question.  One school of thought,<br>
discernible in the Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto, seems to contemplate a natural<br>
"withering away of the state" in the face of a free Net and strong<br>
encryption.  This idea assumes that the new order that will develop within<br>
the "Free Net" will naturally supplant the key social functions of the state<br>
and that, more or less violently, the current order will lose its grip over<br>
people.  The other line of thinking looks to the establishment of functional<br>
and territorial enclaves ("exclaves" in "Expseak"), islands of liberty, in<br>
which individuals develop anarcho-capitalist systems incrementally, slowly<br>
converting the legal governance of the activity of their lives from<br>
state-based to consent-based legal systems.  (Note the resonance of this<br>
dichotomy with two other similar such divisions: The "grace" vs. "works"<br>
division in christian theology and the socialist/marxist question of whether<br>
the proletarian revolution needs an active leadership.)<br>
<p>
If the "natural withering" school is right, we don't need to do anything: The<br>
growing power and functionality of the Free Net will simply eat the state for<br>
us.  The second idea presents significant challenges.  By definition,<br>
incremental libertarianism has to work without coercion.  At each step, the<br>
regime of liberty has to be superior to its alternative, because free<br>
individuals must choose to abide by the agoric, libertarian order, rather<br>
than look to the state as a source of legal and social authority.  Being good<br>
capitalists, we view this on-going choice of systems in economic terms: Which<br>
is better (i.e. more profitable) for me today, acquiescing in the statist<br>
legal and social order, or living and working under this newly-freer anarchic<br>
regime?  It is, perhaps, the problem often discussed here with regard to<br>
"design by evolution": Each step has to be better than the last and no<br>
individual change can cripple the organism (cause a reproductive<br>
disadvantage).<br>
<p>
There are real examples of "incrementalist" processes.  The growing use of<br>
private regimes of commercial dispute resolution (e.g. arbitration) is<br>
perhaps the best known and most impressive.  Those social activities<br>
currently governed by state-sponsored criminal and tort law present stronger<br>
barriers to incrementalism.  Commercial private law lends itself to<br>
bilateralism and transaction-specific implementation; criminal and tort<br>
"transactions" do not.  I have yet to see any convincing proposal for an<br>
incremental implementation of private criminal or tort laws.<br>
<p>
Which leads to a question (assuming anyone has read this far!)  Is anyone on<br>
the list aware of cogent plans or proposals for an incrementalist<br>
implementation of criminal or tort law?<br>
