Actually, it could take less than any of the others. it all depends on<br>
how many cars you want in the loop at one time. you could start with<br>
just one, and keep adding them. its essentially a huge juggling trick,<br>
so you can use that analogy to see how you could keep adding cars until<br>
you reach the capacity of the system to process them. What it will<br>
require is a vast amount of momentum put into the system, to keep things<br>
flowing. Once you get it going, the only energy you need to put in is<br>
that to match the momentum losses induced by new cargo put into the<br>
system. The cars would already have the momentum. Additionally, let me<br>
change the geosynch station, it would not need to be so big, unless it<br>
were handling a loop at full capacity.<br>
