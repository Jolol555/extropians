This is an important problem, and I think it is worth thinking of. How to <br>
manage our brains when we can potentially rewrite them? Accidentally <br>
reformatting our neural networks can be prevented by regular backups, but <br>
what about entering bizarre motivational states (which are subjective, <br>
and quite logical to the victim: "I *enjoy* chanting primes!")? Should we <br>
help them?<br>

I would very much like to see this experiment (or rather the data!). But I<br>
think it would be quite hard to do; movement is limited in a scanner (the<br>
head is fixed), but timing would be very hard;  we might have to use a<br>
rather long-lasting radioisotope, since I assume most participants would<br>
find getting an injection during sex a slight turn-off. And to image the<br>
activity during orgasm the scanner has to be started at the right moment -<br>
the logistics is staggering. And to get noise-free, clean images we must <br>
do this several times - where to get the volunteers? (OK, some are always <br>
kinky enough, but that might be a bias). <br>
<p>
As you can tell, I have pondered many kinds of unusual experiments with a<br>
PET scanner. I want one! Another fun idea would be to study the minds of<br>
very enlightened gurus, to see the physiology of mystic ecstasy (and are<br>
their pineal glands as sclerotic as in normal people of the same age?).<br>
And I want to see how dreams look - but imagine trying to sleep in a<br>
scanner with your head fixed, while a nurse injects radioactive sugar and<br>
your blood is slowly drained by a catheter to measure its radioactivity! <br>
