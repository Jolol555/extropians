<i>&gt; per "rock" (which I think is a single dose -- it may be more).</i><br>
<p>
It typically about $10 per rock, and that is a single dose, which lasts<br>
between 15 minutes and 2 hours, depending on your sensitivity. So its a<br>
little more than going to a movie...with no real experiences at the end<br>
of it...<br>
<p>
The biggest impact that crack has is the impurities are so toxic that<br>
they frequently short circuit the brain, causing losses in IQ. This sort<br>
of damage is in my my the real tragedy, where you have people destroying<br>
themsleves one dose at a time. If it were a commercially available<br>
product, powder coke would be $10 a gram, with fine quality and not<br>
dangerous impurities, as suffficient public standards would ensure<br>
product safety. People would avoid street crack like the plague....<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;People who use too much and go "raving paranoid" would be primarily a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;danger only to themselves and those who choose to associate with them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not so neat or so fair as that.  What about the unfortunate people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who happen to be on the bus, train, or street, or in the store or post</i><br>
<i>&gt; office or bank, or wherever such people show up and start shooting</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody in sight?  Also, you may underestimate the strength of bonds</i><br>
<i>&gt; of love (familial and romantic), of codependency, even of friendship.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "It's their own fault" is disturbingly easy to say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This is where the substance is being blamed for the shortcomings in the<br>
familial relationships. If they weren't screwed up to begin with,<br>
substance abuse would not be a problem.<br>
