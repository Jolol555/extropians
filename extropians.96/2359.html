The gamut of variations on this theme is being explored by the brilliant<br>
Australian sf writer Greg Egan in a series of stories and novels, especially<br>
PERMUTATION CITY and the forthcoming DIASPORA.  Many stories in his<br>
collection AXIOMATIC deal quite rigorously (or at least inventively) with<br>
versions of this topic.  <br>
<p>
My take: obviously a non-destructive copy of a functioning person is another<br>
person.  (There's a sense in which the passage of time creates a<br>
destructive, updated copy of each of us.)  If I were offered the chance of a<br>
lethal injection in exchange for the creation of a perfect (or even<br>
renovated) version of my phenotype, or ten or 100 copies for that matter, I<br>
would mutter a very rude word and go home.  Frank Tipler's most absurd<br>
sophistry in THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY is his claim that a perfect<br>
atom-for-atom emulation of you is continuous with you, hence *is* you, even<br>
if it's built 100 billion years in the future.  Oh dear oh dear.<br>
