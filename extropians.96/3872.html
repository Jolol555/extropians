I thought the scores were always divisible by ten ( like 720 and 790 maybe ).<br>

<p>
The SATs test the aptitude of high school and occasionally elementary school<br>
students at basic math, vocabulary, and comprehension skills.  The scores<br>
range from 200-800.  You receive one score for math (maximum of 800) and one<br>
score for language (maximum of 800) for a total possible maximum of 1600<br>
points.  Average composite scores hover somewhere between 900-1100,<br>
depending on the school district.<br>
<p>
It is primarily a benchmark of how well you were educated at the time you<br>
took the test, and has little relevance to intelligence.  Age can be an<br>
important factor since all age groups take the same test.  Most people take<br>
it in their junior or senior years of highschool, but some people take it as<br>
early as late elementary school.<br>
<p>
Personally, I think it is pretty lame to be posting SAT scores.  What do<br>
they prove?  So much feather ruffling...<br>
