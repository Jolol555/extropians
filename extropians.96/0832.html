<i>&gt;Most of us on this list don't have the time or energy to waste trying </i><br>
<i>&gt;to change the way people think, and that is certainly not what I am </i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to do here.  What I am saying is that there is a time and a </i><br>
<i>&gt;place for certain kinds of expression, and you have chosen to </i><br>
<i>&gt;participate in two of the most serious lists on the net.  If you want </i><br>
<i>&gt;to be heard, try to keep your expression within certain parameters, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and try not to insult groups of people on the lists.</i><br>
You're absolutely right. I was out of line. I apologize. I don't mean to<br>
offend anyone. Now that this is over, lets get on with other threads. I<br>
don't wish to tarnish my reputation on this mailinglist and I hope you can<br>
forgive me.<br>
