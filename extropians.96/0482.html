I've been thinking a lot lately about the evolution of things.  About <br>
technology.  Nanotech.  Artificial Life.  Artificial Intelligence.  And I was <br>
thinking that it's only a matter of time until some very highly advanced <br>
nanotech auto-replicators evolve from technology.  It's also only a matter of <br>
time until very advanced artificial intelligence develops, and develops <br>
capabilities far exceeding human capabilities.  <br>
<p>
I also see no reason to suppose that humans will have control over these <br>
developments, past a certain point.  Sure, we will try to make these things <br>
very friendly to life and to humans, and it may be in their best interests to <br>
be so.  But I can think of all kinds of reasons why none of these developments <br>
would really care about humans or other types of life.  I can think of <br>
situations where they would care about other life enough to not displace it <br>
too much, but I can't find any compelling reasons why this should necessarily <br>
happen.<br>
<p>
I think some very advanced life forms will eventually emerge through <br>
technology.  Life forms far more advanced than current Earth life, in terms of <br>
survivability and in their ability to evolve quickly and exploit energy <br>
resources efficiently.  I don't think that current forms of life will really <br>
have much of a chance against these advanced forms.<br>
<p>
This actually isn't very disturbing to me -- I sort of think it's a good <br>
thing.  Survival of the fittest.  We're all for it when we're the fittest.  <br>
But how long will that be?<br>
<p>
I love life.  Not just my life.  But Life.  The whole concept.  Things <br>
mutating and adapting and competing.  Weeding out the inferior.  The whole <br>
process.  I think it's great.  I just think that future life may look back on <br>
us the way we look back on pre-cellular life.  Interesting, yes.  But only the <br>
first step.  Just setting things up for the explosion.  Ancestral, but still <br>
very primative.<br>
<p>
It should be interesting to see how things develop -- for as long as I can <br>
keep up, that is.<br>
