<p>
<i>&gt; Rhetorical causality. The same kind of causality that was used to </i><br>
<i>&gt; establish the United States of America, for instance. </i><br>
<p>
That's not how the American Revolution happened.  There was no <br>
concept of memetic engineering.  No one thought, in the 1750s, "If we <br>
get that revolution meme (or idea) out there, a revolution will occur."  <br>
<p>
The idea of memetic engineering implies a self-conscious manipulation <br>
of public opinion by someone standing apart.  Jefferson, Adams, Paine, <br>
and the others advocated certain ideas and initiated certain actions.  <br>
They didn't stand off to the side and throw memes in front of the <br>
public.  They  *participated* in the events leading up to the revolution.  <br>
<p>
What puzzles me is the concept that if one "promotes extropian ideas,"  <br>
for example by producing a calendar with pictures of space colonies, <br>
that this will somehow cause something to happen that would not have <br>
happened otherwise.  This reminds me of those cartoons about "people <br>
who aren't clear on the concept."  <br>

On December 5, Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; there [are] no less than eight separate and distinct phenomena </i><br>
<i>&gt; that could arguably be called "causality", and philosophers still </i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't untangled the four types they know about - computational, </i><br>
<i>&gt; platonic, thermodynamic and cognitive causality.  </i><br>
<p>
Leaving aside the fact that philosophers have discussed many other <br>
kinds of causality, the question I want to raise is:  <br>
When someone tries to get the extropian meme in front of the public, <br>
and expects this to have an effect, upon which type of causality is this <br>
expectation based?  <br>
<p>
----------------------------<br>
Incidentally, Eliezer's statement <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I scored astronomically high on the SAT ... but have a </i><br>
<i>&gt; relatively normal IQ of 143, and I do causal analysis, </i><br>
<i>&gt; so the SAT apparently tests just that.  </i><br>
<p>
is a non sequitur.  <br>
<p>
(As long as we're bragging about SATs, my scores were 721 verbal, <br>
793 mathematical.  A few weeks ago people were posting their ages; <br>
it would be interesting to post SATs as well.)  <br>
<p>

Eric Watt Forste adds, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's funny watching the people who are wholly on one side or the </i><br>
<i>&gt; other of Snow's boundary running around acting snooty and superior </i><br>
<i>&gt; to the people on the other side. </i><br>
<p>
I never bought into the "two cultures" bullshit.  I majored in math <br>
and minored in classics.  But this has nothing to do with the point about <br>
causality.  I don't know why Eric has chosen to bring private business <br>
onto the list.  <br>
