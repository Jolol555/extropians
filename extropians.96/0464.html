<i>&gt;You are kidding, aren't you?  5 years?</i><br>
Ok so maybe I was a little over optimistic :)<br>
I guess I was a little euphoric over the success of the current Hotwired thread.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides which, seen from my own extropian perspective, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;unnecessarily bellicose to talk of annihilation of competing</i><br>
<i>&gt;memesets.  Better to speak of ours "outcompeting" theirs.</i><br>
Yeah but wouldn't outcompeting mean annihilation? We need to spread the meme<br>
as far and wide as possible to get it to the masses as quickly as possible<br>
so as to speed things up even more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I have also seen great</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interest in the IRC channels expecially among the technically-minded.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;-- End of quoted excerpt from Chris Hind</i><br>

<i>&gt;Even the "technically-minded" on the IRC channels have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;attention span of goldfish.  Sorry, this is just a reaction to</i><br>
<i>&gt;my experience on the HotWired Chat today, where I logged in</i><br>
<i>&gt;expecting high-quality interaction related to the More/Borsook</i><br>
<i>&gt;debate, and instead saw 'wannafuck?' messages aimed at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;few women in the room.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Grumble.</i><br>
<p>
All threads must die eventually. Now that the main debate between Max and<br>
Paulina is over, the thread will wither and die because there is no one to<br>
direct it and prevent it from becoming a general topic zone. Maybe you<br>
joined the thread a little too late. Sorry.<br>
