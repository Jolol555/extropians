<p>
Selling well doesn't qualify music as "quality".  I cringe when I think<br>
about some of the music that has sold well over the years.  I was defining<br>
"quality" in a technical sense.  I would submit that on a technical level<br>
(musically), that Ace of Base is a very average band in its genre with few<br>
outstanding features.  I recognize that some of the music *I* like is<br>
technically mediocre, and am fine with that.  But I won't ever claim that it<br>
is "quality" or "great" music simply because I like it.<br>
<p>
By technical quality, I guess I am referring to the level of musical talent<br>
required to produce the music.  The music Ace of Base puts out did not<br>
require a terribly large amount of musical talent, IMO.  This doesn't mean<br>
its not very likeable music, but that musically it is nothing special.<br>
Admittedly, Ace of Base is not my "cup of tea", but this has little to do<br>
with my evaluation.  There are many genres of music that I don't<br>
particularly like, but which contain bands who have great musical talent.  I<br>
like to think that musically I have an open mind and my collection of music<br>
does contain bands from almost every genre.<br>
<p>
I suppose that part of this is my upbringing.  I have a few family members<br>
and relatives who were professional musicians (orchestral), and I studied<br>
music from the ages of 4 thru 14.  I have a tendency to evaluate music on a<br>
technical level.  In fact, I often consider the lyrics to be secondary to<br>
the music.  The upshot of this is that my judgements often appear correct to<br>
music snobs, but incorrect to the more average person because my musical<br>
values were created by music snobs.<br>

<i>&gt;combining new sounds with 'retro eighties' (disco, electro, ebm, industrial)</i><br>

<i>&gt;and hype enough)</i><br>
<p>
I heard about this, but I haven't had the opportunity to listen to it yet.<br>

Well, this statement might be pushing the threshold a little bit.  Very few<br>
people are making "hits" with only an amiga.  Although those machines were<br>
way ahead of their time in terms of their audio capabilities, you can only<br>
weasel so much horsepower out of them.  Still I have great respect the<br>
people who try.  I think part of it is how much you expect out of the<br>
machine.  If you are willing to work within the limits of the machine,<br>
you're okay.  I wish more audio centric computers and software would become<br>
available (or maybe I should design one myself!) because I have yet to find<br>
a machine that can do all the things with sound that I want it to do.  Synth<br>
architectures seem to be stuck in a rut.<br>
