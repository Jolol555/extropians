I don't want to assume your case or the opposite.  What I want is for<br>
people who speculate on these things to acknowledge the uncertainties<br>
up front, rather than at the end of a long conversation.  I see way<br>
too many baldface claims of the form "with nanotech, X will happen".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The current economy is *not* driven by raw physical production economy</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This atatement is not self-evident. Defend it. :-)</i><br>
<p>
I'm not speculating.   Production, including labor to run it, only<br>
takes about 15% of US GDP (I think).  Standard econ statistic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For many items, "inventing" and "marketing" may end up being handled</i><br>
<i>&gt;informally, the way cooks trade recipes. </i><br>
<p>
I think you are mixing timescales.  Eventually, good public domain<br>
designs may become widespread.  But by then lots of other stuff may<br>
change too, including an upload population explosion.  And the private<br>
designs may be far superior, and so worth paying a premium for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Correct, of course. However, I feel that the relative inefficiency</i><br>
<i>&gt;of "drop-out" to "mainline" lifestyle will be much smaller with MNT.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll spend esswentially zero time on the mechanics of living as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;MNT drop-out. As a non-MNT mountain man, I'd spend a lot of time on</i><br>
<i>&gt;making a living, I think.</i><br>
<p>
You are talking about pretty advanced designs, and so not about early<br>
nanotech.  You need intelligent machines to make your life that easy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; This all depends on the speed of change.  Why would it be that fast?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Why not? What will limit the speed of adoption of MNT? what will limit</i><br>
<i>&gt;the rate of advance of MNT technology, given the obvious (to me, anyway)</i><br>
<i>&gt;feedback mechanisms by which MNT will beget better MNT?</i><br>
<p>
Of course there are feedback mechanisms.  But that doesn't imply fast <br>
change, only change at some speed.   Imagining, designing, testing,<br>
tuning, marketing, etc. of designs all takes time and intelligence.<br>
And make no mistake - nanotech design is HARD.  These are very complex<br>
machines that are imagined.<br>
