        The creativity well has been a little bit dry, so to speak, as I<br>
have been quite pressed for time.  This past weekend I had the opportunity<br>
to spread the extropian memes in what is (in my opinion) one of the best<br>
ways possible: through artistic means.  Here is something recent I have<br>
written...hope you enjoy. <br>
<p>
<p>
QUERY<br>
<p>
To the moors and the afts of twilight's glare<br>
I have nothing, oh nothing, nothing to bear;<br>
To the purplish violet, to the crimson rose,<br>
My pockets are empty, not a thing to disclose;<br>
As I walk through the streets of the city-beau,<br>
With its horrors and hungers I shall never know,<br>
I speak to myself, I wonder aloud<br>
'Bout the silence beyond the world's sheer shroud;<br>
"What lies up above?" I yell without fear<br>
At the top of my lungs for all men to hear,<br>
"How far can we go before there's an end<br>
 To the vast universe upon which we depend?<br>
 Or if there's no end how much will we see<br>
 Of the space, the cosmos, of eternity?<br>
 Will we find what we're after: the ultimate clue<br>
 To the meaning of life, the answer that's true?<br>
 Or will man never learn to surpass the bind<br>
 To ethereal pleasures within his small mind?"<br>
It was at this time I looked up at the moon,<br>
Shook my head and hoped for an answer quite soon;<br>
I carried on down my merry old way,<br>
And have not found an answer to this very day.<br>
