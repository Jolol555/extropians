<i>&gt; Our current language is like how computers across the internet talk to each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other via TCP/IP when we use a completely different language to think. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that we will migrate toward a more visual-based language such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly detailed stories but created quickly with tools to relay alot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; information to another individual.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting idea indeed.  People think, at least partly, in the<br>
language that they use to communicate.  But unfortunately, language<br>
is created primarily for communication between individuals, not for<br>
managing ideas within an individual's own mind.   I suspect that it<br>
is possible to improve intelligence by creating a language that<br>
better facilitates thinking.  Just as you've suggested, such a<br>
language could be oriented more towards visualization rather than<br>
the usual serial stream of sounds or written symbols.  The "grammar"<br>
of such a language could provide for language constructs of two or<br>
more dimensions.  It could also be used for communication, just like<br>
any other language, but would be conveyed as 2d graphics, or even 3d<br>
models.  It should probably have no spoken counterpart since that<br>
would difficult to reconcile with its non-linear nature, and would<br>
likely be detrimental to the mode of thinking that it is intended to<br>
facilitate. <br>
<p>
I think that the development and experimental use of such a language <br>
would be a fascinating endeavor.<br>
