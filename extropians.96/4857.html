In my previous post, I started examining Michael Shermer's method of <br>
argument, i.e. the "jumping together" phenomenon.  In this post, I want <br>
to examine another aspect of his epistemology, and contrast it with the <br>
epistemology and methodology of revisionism.    <br>
<p>
Introduction.  <br>
<p>
On page 54 of his article, Michael Shermer quotes one of David Cole's <br>
questions:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At Mauthausen, the gas chamber has no locks on the doors, </i><br>
<i>&gt; no holes or fittings where locks may once have been.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The doors can be opened from inside or outside.  How could you </i><br>
<i>&gt; kill people here?  Wouldn't they storm the door and push it open?  </i><br>
<p>
On the next page, Michael comments:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When one has overwhelming evidence from many different sources </i><br>
<i>&gt; about mass homicides at a death camp, one may not notice </i><br>
<i>&gt; what kind of door handle is on one gas chamber.  Unless, of course, </i><br>
<i>&gt; one goes there in search of problems in order to support a particular </i><br>
<i>&gt; thesis... </i><br>
<p>
I will return to this amazing statement later.  For the moment I just <br>
want to present it for the reader to ponder.  <br>
<p>
Michael Shermer tries to make it appear that David Cole is somehow  <br>
in the wrong just because he went there, looked at the evidence, and <br>
tried to draw a conclusion from it.  This is a repudiation of logic itself, <br>
the very principle that makes science (or jurisprudence) possible.  <br>
<p>
The Basic Methodology of Revisionism -- part 1.  <br>
<p>
In *ESP: A Scientific Evaluation*, C. E. M. Hansel undertook the task <br>
of refuting the evidence for ESP.  One immediately wonders how he <br>
could possibly do this.  ESP is not one thing, it is 10,000 things.  <br>
How is Hansel going to disprove the whole thing, in one finite book?  <br>
<p>
He proceeds as follows:  He looks at some of J. B. Rhine's <br>
"experiments," and keeps looking at them until they are in focus, <br>
at which point they fall apart.  When you zoom in on them, it becomes <br>
obvious that they are not really experiments, they are set-ups designed <br>
to produce a desired result.  The implication is, if you look at other <br>
experiments with the same scrutiny, they will also fall apart.  Thus he <br>
can discredit a whole class of evidence.  <br>
<p>
By going through several classes of evidence in this manner, he can <br>
discredit the whole field of psychic research.  <br>
<p>
Hansel tells a story about a judge in Singapore.  One night, after the <br>
judge was in bed, an acquaintance of his appeared in his room.  The <br>
next morning he heard that the man died that night, about the time the <br>
apparition appeared.  The man's wife confirmed what he said.  As you <br>
read this, you see no reason whatever to doubt what is being said -- <br>
except for the obvious implausibility of the idea itself.  <br>
<p>
But then, just as you have started to entertain the idea that this might <br>
really be true, Hansel pulls the rug out from under you:  it turns out that <br>
the story could not have taken place as described; the judge wasn't <br>
even married at the time, the man who died did so in the morning after <br>
a good night's sleep... it just could not have happened as described.  <br>
This whole thing is presented very skillfully, so when you finally come <br>
to the revelation that the story is false, it is a surprise, almost a shock.  <br>
<p>
Why did he tell this story?  He wanted to suggest that all such stories, <br>
no matter how plausible, must be regarded with suspicion.  You can <br>
have any number of ghost stories, but they do not "corroborate" each <br>
other and prove the existence of ghosts.  <br>
<p>
Of course, he has not proved that all ghost stories are false.  That <br>
would be impossible.  Strictly speaking, the fact that one story is false <br>
does not imply anything about other stories.  But he has *discredited* <br>
the whole class of stories.  He has raised a question in the reader's <br>
mind, and aroused suspicion that will carry over to all such stories.  <br>
<p>
Likewise, he has not proved that all ESP experiments are bogus.  But <br>
when he describes an experiment that seems to prove something, and <br>
then shows that the experiment was set up in such a way as to allow <br>
cheating, the reader will never again take any such experiment at face <br>
value.  Hansel has aroused suspicion that will carry over to all such <br>
experiments.  <br>
<p>
The problem of disproving the gas chambers is similar to the problem <br>
Hansel set himself.  Given a large number of eyewitness reports <br>
testifying that something happened, how can one prove it didn't <br>
happen?  The best way to proceed is to do what Hansel did.  Take an <br>
eyewitness report, show it to be absurd, and thus raise doubts in the <br>
reader's mind about all such reports.   <br>
<p>
Actually the revisionists have a much easier problem, because unlike <br>
ESP the gas chambers were a finite, localized phenomenon, and there <br>
are only a few witnesses.  A few, that is, compared with the number of <br>
witnesses who report having psychic experiences, or seeing ghosts or <br>
UFOs.  I don't know how many gas chamber witnesses there are <br>
altogether, but I keep seeing the same ones quoted over and over:  <br>
Nyiszli, Hoess, Gerstein, Broad, and Eichmann.  It always seems to be <br>
assumed that there are thousands of others, but one never sees <br>
references to them.  I get the impression that the total number of SS <br>
guards and sonderkommandos who described the gassing operation is <br>
less than fifty; maybe less than ten.  Therefore, unlike witnesses for <br>
ESP, it would be possible to go through the whole list and scrutinize <br>
each one.  <br>
<p>
Nevertheless, Hansel's procedure is the best way to start.  If the <br>
revisionist can show some plausible-sounding reports of gassing to be <br>
absurd, then all such stories will be regarded with extreme suspicion <br>
from then on.  The whole collection of such stories will no longer seem <br>
"overwhelming."  Then, when one demonstrates that the stories are in <br>
conflict with physical evidence, this demonstration will have much <br>
more force.  <br>
<p>
That's why I keep saying that anyone who wants to pursue this subject <br>
should read the Nyiszli book -- and read it with the same scrutiny and <br>
skepticism you would bring to bear on a book by J. B. Rhine.  <br>
<p>
<p>
The Basic Methodology of Revisionism -- part 2 <br>
<p>
Now, I want to consider another aspect of Hansel's book.  *How* did <br>
he demonstrate that Rhine's experiments were not really experiments?  <br>
<p>
First of all, Hansel approached Rhine's work with the assumption that <br>
there had to be a flaw somewhere, no matter how obscure, no matter <br>
how subtle.  Hansel started with the working hypothesis that ESP does <br>
not exist;  therefore, if you scrutinize one of Rhine's experiments <br>
carefully enough, there had to be a way to cheat.  <br>
<p>
This is how the revisionists look at the gas chamber story.  They <br>
assume that reports of gassing, no matter how plausible, will turn out to <br>
be false if you scrutinize them carefully enough.  When Hansel does <br>
this, it's a valid procedure.  When Philip Klass does the same thing <br>
with UFO stories, that's all right too.  But it's not all right for the <br>
revisionists to do the same thing.  They are (gasp!) defending their <br>
belief system!!   They must have an agenda!!!<br>
<p>
How, specifically, did Hansel argue his case?  He used logic.  He went <br>
to the room where the experiments were conducted, and looked for <br>
ways to cheat.  He noticed, for example, that there was a transom over <br>
the door of the room, so that someone could stand on a chair and look <br>
into the room, and see the cards.  <br>
<p>
?   When one has overwhelming evidence from many different sources <br>
?   about the existence of ESP, one may not notice what kind of door <br>
?   is on one experimental room.  Unless, of course, one goes there <br>
?   in search of problems in order to support a particular thesis... <br>
<p>
Yes, of course Hansel went there in search of problems to support his <br>
thesis.   That's how science works.  One formulates a thesis, and then <br>
one looks for evidence to support it.  <br>
<p>
Hansel's thesis was that Rhine's experiments were bogus.  He looked <br>
at the evidence and drew a logical conclusion:  since this door has a <br>
transom through which the experimenters could look at the cards, the <br>
"experiment" didn't prove anything about ESP.  <br>
<p>
But Michael Shermer objects to this procedure!!!  <br>
<p>
Let's look at this statement once again:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  When one has overwhelming evidence from many different sources </i><br>
<i>&gt;  about mass homicides at a death camp, one may not notice </i><br>
<i>&gt;  what kind of door handle is on one gas chamber.  Unless, of course, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  one goes there in search of problems in order to support a particular </i><br>
<i>&gt;  thesis... </i><br>
<p>
That's exactly the kind of thing Hansel would notice -- a door handle -- <br>
some little discrepancy that reveals what's really going on.  Exactly the   <br>
kind of thing Randi would notice when watching Uri Geller.  The same  <br>
thing Sherlock Holmes would call a clue -- one fact that can light up a  <br>
whole landscape.   <br>
<p>
That's how science works.  Without the ability to look at physical <br>
reality and draw logical conclusions, experimental science would be <br>
impossible.  <br>
<p>
----------------------------<br>
<p>
If you look at Extropy magazine, issue #16, page 22, you will find a <br>
full-page ad for Skeptic magazine.  In an issue of Exponent last year, <br>
Max More endorsed Skeptic magazine and said that Michael Shermer <br>
had come to Extro 2, as if that were something to be proud of.  <br>
<p>
So don't ask me about the relevance of this thread to Extropianism.  <br>
<p>
The question that needs to be addressed is:  What is the relevance of <br>
Skeptic magazine to Extropianism?   Max, are you willing to defend <br>
Michael Shermer's epistemology?  Or not?  <br>
