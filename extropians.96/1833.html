I've been following the list for quite a while without contributing any<br>
comment but I'd like to jump in somewhere, so hey . .<br>
<p>
	The possibility of powerful civilizations or entities cloaking<br>
themselves in more innocuous biology is also an SF classic, handled<br>
with  sophistication in Greg Bear's "Anvil of Stars". It's doubtful that<br>
a very small, very unobtrusive probe could do more than find the sort of<br>
showy activities that might be detected from some distance. <br>
	Life is of course a species of nanotech. Nanotech suggests the<br>
possibility of technological sophistication. How can 'natural'<br>
nanomachines be distinguished from 'artificial' with a high degree of<br>
certainty? It would be nice if as the scene from 'Blade Runner' the<br>
fakes came with serial numbers. Rather like the 'gray goo' problem it's<br>
not much of a problem if you're asking about 'accidents'. With no<br>
consideration of possible deception, the difference is significant.<br>
Deception, however, is a common aspect of all models of evolution. This<br>
thread implies a transcendentally sophisticated tangle of deception. So<br>
'how can you tell if life is natural?' is a messy question.<br>
	One direction that this line leads is an SF variant I don't recall<br>
seeing (but I haven't kept up with SF). A post-singularity civilization<br>
finds a planet with a complicated biosphere. They are very wary, to the<br>
point of paranoia, about exploring directly. How can they tell who or<br>
what might have made this place and with what purpose? The problem is an<br>
exercise in applied theology - specifically a rigorous variant of the<br>
argument from design. How can they evaluate the place while keeping<br>
'deniability'? Maybe conspiratorially manipulating lesser species?<br>
	Anyway, the problem with the low profile line of argument IMHO is that<br>
while it's fun it ends up in the same pattern of reasoning as conspiracy<br>
theories. Occam's razor is the better tool.<br>

Mark H. I'm just starting to do mail on netscape 3.0 and I haven't done<br>
a signature file yet. I'm very happy with it so far for news/mail/telnet<br>
the works.<br>
