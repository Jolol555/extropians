In a message dated 96-12-23 06:01:13 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I dunno about immortal souls but don't we have immortality already? If the<br>
 universe continually bangs, crunches, bangs, crunches, to infinity, then<br>
 our atoms and electrons have a finite chance of being at the exact same<br>
 location at the exact same time somewhere in the future. Am I correct? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This has been on my top two list of ways to achieve immortality for a few<br>
years now.  I was ever so depressed the first time I saw that someone else<br>
had come up with the idea.<br>
<p>
The other way is through use of the many-worlds theory.  If there are near<br>
infinite universes than there must be one where you continue on unaware that<br>
death has occurred in another world (near infinite worlds if you wish to be<br>
technical but I like to simplify).  There are many problems with this of<br>
course.  What if your brain dead or mentally impaired from some accident?<br>
 Does that count as death?  Personally, I'm looking for other ways.<br>
