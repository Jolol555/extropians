What do you mean, the Powers can't operate at our level except through<br>
us?  Vinge's A Fire Upon The Deep is *fiction*.  That's all.  Vinge can<br>
no more write a realistic Power than an amoeba can write a realistic<br>
human.  A genuine Power wouldn't be stopped by the Zones, wouldn't be<br>
taken unaware by the Blight, wouldn't fade out after ten years, would be<br>
able to deduce what Countermeasure was and where to find it without even<br>
trying, and would see as obvious enough physics to rewrite the Zones any<br>
time it wanted to.<br>
<p>
The most unrealistic part of A Fire Upon The Deep wasn't the Zones.  To<br>
paraphrase Douglas Adams, the Zones just presume there's something in<br>
the Universe we don't know about, and God knows there are enough of<br>
those.  The unrealistic part is Vinge claiming that there's something<br>
the Powers don't know about.  That's just ridiculous, wildly impossible,<br>
and the sole justification for it is that the novel required it.<br>
<p>
The Powers, our future selves, will be smarter than we are.  They will<br>
be able to do anything we can and a hell of a lot more.  There is<br>
nothing they will forget that we know, no problem we can solve that they<br>
can't.  Don't forget that.  Most of the discussion on this list is<br>
absolutely ridiculous because we're discussing problems that will be<br>
solved in instants by beings beyond our imagination.  Our sole<br>
responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are; any problems<br>
beyond that are not ours to solve.<br>
<p>
Also, I doubt the Zones are a metaphor for anything.<br>
