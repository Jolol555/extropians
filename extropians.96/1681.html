As a newbie lurker I'm hesitant to put forward my own extropian interests <br>
because of their potential redundancy. I've yet to browse the archives, <br>
or do more than bookmark Anders page. With a five day weekend coming up <br>
I'm hoping to be a little more prepared before posting again.<br>
<p>
However, there are two topics I'm currently researching that I don't see <br>
in discussion. (I imagine that they may have already been discussed to <br>
death on this list, but...). One is current and near future NGO space <br>
travel potential. The other is the implications of the Human Genome <br>
Project.<br>
<p>
So? Discussed to death or new avenues of exploration?<br>
<p>
