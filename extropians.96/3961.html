<i>&gt;I was also thinking about the idea of farming humans to eat.</i><br>
<p>
What was that movie called? Soilent Green? (sp?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Humans are </i><br>
<i>&gt;expensive to feed, and they take several years to mature, but if someone </i><br>
<i>&gt;really enjoyed human meat, is there anything wrong with farming them?</i><br>
<p>
Yum, Yum!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One </i><br>
<i>&gt;might say it's a waste of mental abilities and that the humans could be used </i><br>
<i>&gt;for better things than food,</i><br>
<p>
Sensual pleasures? Sounds like the stuff cheap sci-fi is made of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hell, we could even lobotomize the ones we farm so they </i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't so difficult to deal with.  They would be our property, after all,</i><br>
and <br>
<i>&gt;we would be raising them for the purpose of being eaten.</i><br>
<p>
Here is where I come in with my idea of a genengineered race of human<br>
biological drones which would be custom designed for whatever purpose we<br>
gave them and could possibly even put brain-computer interfaces in their<br>
skull (there wouldn't be much brain to take up the skull cavity anyways)<br>
and use these interfaces to operate these drones remotely. Of course there<br>
would be multiple checks to prevent the possibility of an intelligent drone<br>
slipping through the cracks and creating a revolution of some sort.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In a goal-attainment </i><br>
<i>&gt;sense, farming humans for food is not "wrong". But why does it feel wrong?  </i><br>
<p>
I wonder if this is how cannibal psychopaths feel? We use emotions to<br>
sympathize with other animals which is our sense of "others". Its probably<br>
closely linked to self-awareness. If you are absolute logic and zero<br>
emotion, cannibalism wouldn't be a problem which brings up the interesting<br>
question if emotion and consciousness are inseparable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, is there really anything "wrong" with enslaving women to bear children </i><br>
<i>&gt;to raise for various purposes? If they are lobotomized, they will probably</i><br>
go <br>
<i>&gt;along with it willingly enough.</i><br>
<p>
There are some that already are lobotomized by society or rather by peers.<br>
