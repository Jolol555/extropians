If there are small groups of trustworthy extropians who live near each<br>
other and can hand-around a paper ms, promising to get feedback to me<br>
quickly, I might send a copy to one or two such groups.  Do you live near<br>
some others who you can vouch for and who have knowledge about the topic?<br>

Then we are talking past each other.  The 500 white guys who routinely vote<br>
each other onto all the Boards of all the big American Corporations, along<br>
with 90$Million bonuses, would certainly like your point of view.  Any<br>
effort on our parts to hold them accountable for conspiring together would<br>
be seen by them as invasion of their privacy.  And ANY means you come up<br>
with, from laws to PGP, that helps YOU keep a secret will be 10 times as<br>
effective in their hands.  The same holds doubly for other power centers,<br>
especially criminal organizations, 3rd world kleptocracies and the techno<br>
elite.<br>

<i>&gt; I maintain that detecting conspiracies has not been a usefull means</i><br>

<i>&gt;policies is usually a waste of time.</i><br>
<p>
An utterly bizarre notion.  Forgive me for assuming that you have read<br>
virtually no history, nor traced the evolution of oppressive tyrannies in<br>
ages past.  When freedom thrived, it was always in the face of conspiracies<br>
that were thwarted by exposure.  Every time freedom collapsed, it was<br>
because of conspiracies that succeeded.<br>
