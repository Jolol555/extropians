Rich Artym: <br>
<i>&gt; I don't know how you reached this idea that </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanomachines need to be AIs,</i><br>
<p>
That's not what I said.  <br>
<p>
A nanomachine per se does not have to be an AI.  <br>
<p>
Any system, nano or macro, capable of creating a pipeline, will contain <br>
within it many human-level intelligences.  Any system, nano or macro, <br>
capable of producing the variety of goods produced by the American <br>
economy or the Japanese economy, will contain within it approximately <br>
a hundred million human-level intelligences.  <br>
<p>
In a complex construction project, such as creating a pipeline, there are <br>
many points at which a decision has to be made which requires human <br>
judgment.  In other words, whoever makes this decision has to <br>
understand the whole project, and the purpose of his present task within <br>
the project.  He has to understand what he is doing in terms of a causal <br>
model of the world, which is what I mean by human-level intelligence.  <br>
At present, such decisions are made by human beings.  In the future, <br>
they may be made by robots with AI.  But the same decisions that <br>
have to be made now will still have to be made in the future, and these <br>
decisions will still require a mind with a causal model of the world.  <br>
<p>
In last night's post, about how to calibrate the idea of Extropian <br>
Nanotech, I carefully avoided assuming anything about AI.  <br>
I assumed that all decisions requiring human judgment would be made <br>
by humans, either in the design stage, or in the production stage.  <br>
However, this does not affect the point made above:  the same decisions <br>
that are made now will still have to be made in an economy based on <br>
Extropian Nanotech, and those decisions will still require human <br>
judgment.  <br>
