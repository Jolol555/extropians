<i>&gt;But a real question is presented to cryonicists by this rhetorical question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If cryonicists are right and "reanimation" lies in their future, then life</i><br>
<i>&gt;insurance proceeds paid upon their "deanimation" might be at risk.  Will the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Acme Life Insurance Company be entitled to recover policy death benefits</i><br>
upon<br>
<i>&gt;reanimation, with interest?  Perhaps more chilling, might a life insurance</i><br>
<i>&gt;adjuster be entitled to question the fact of death at the time the claim is</i><br>
<i>&gt;made?</i><br>
<p>
When somebody is cryonically suspended you can never consider it a certainty<br>
that the person will be revived.  Currently we can't unfreeze, period.  Even<br>
when and if such problems are solved there remains the possibility that the<br>
cause of death can never be fixed.  So when somebody is frozen, you can't<br>
know whether they'll eventually end up alive or dead, and (this is the point)<br>
you *never* will know that they will remain dead forever.  So the only time<br>
you could reasonably pay out would be at the normal death/freezing.  If the<br>
life companies maintain they should never pay for somebody who (at the time<br>
of benefits) may well never live again they'll be laughed out of court.<br>
<p>
Since all the life insurance companies have planned and priced their policy<br>
without accounting for suspension/reanimation they will just maintain that<br>
policy.  It's no problem for them, and there really is no other logical way<br>
to handle it.<br>
