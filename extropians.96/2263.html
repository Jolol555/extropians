Was that what you meant? I had the impression you was talking about the <br>
Vinge use of the term (roughly "Sneaky take-over of vital systems, and <br>
then using them against somebody").<br>
<p>

<p>
Well, that depends on the possibility to self-augment using computing <br>
resources. While computer security is full of holes everywhere, it isn't <br>
that bad - cracking into computers to get more computing power is <br>
non-trivial and takes time, even for an SI. The idea that a sufficiently <br>
smart being could crack everything is a myth. <br>
