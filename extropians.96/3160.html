<i>&gt; I hate to be a doomsayer, and generally I am not, but I honestly believe </i><br>
<i>&gt; we have a serious problem coming in the future and we need to </i><br>
<i>&gt; deal with it intelligently.  I also believe that the only realistic way of </i><br>
<i>&gt; dealing with this problem is to radically transform ourselves into </i><br>
<i>&gt; incredibly powerful and intelligent beings, so we can keep up with </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the others who are doing the same thing.  And I am optimistic </i><br>
<i>&gt; that  we can keep up, if we are committed to and continue </i><br>
<i>&gt; advancing ourselves quickly.  </i><br>
<p>
It depends on who is included in "we."  Some will keep up and some <br>
won't.  <br>
<p>
I grew up in Midland, Texas, the headquarters of the west Texas <br>
oil industry.  This area was settled in the 1880s and 90s (i.e. taken over <br>
from the Indians).  There were lots of small farms and ranches.  <br>
By the 1950s, there were a few large ranches.  As one old-timer put it, <br>
"The big uns done ate the little uns plumb up."  <br>
<p>
And then the big ranchers got eaten up by something even bigger.  <br>
<p>
That's how it will be in the future.  In one form or another, the big uns <br>
always eat the little uns up.  But it can take very different forms.  <br>
The question is whether the  big uns will be independent, like the <br>
ranchers in west Texas, or corporations acting under the aegis of <br>
democratic governments.  <br>
<p>
The construction of energy collectors orbiting the sun, and other such <br>
projects, may be funded by DOD, and justified by the twin objectives <br>
of fighting racism and prosecuting the war on drugs.  The contractors <br>
who build the collectors may have to file environmental impact <br>
statements, in which they assess the effect of the collectors on <br>
endangered asteroids, not to mention endangered life forms on earth.  <br>
<p>
But of course this is not what most people have in mind when they <br>
think of "transhumans."  They think of ranchers in space who can <br>
build energy collectors if they want to, without answering to any <br>
bureaucracy.  <br>
<p>
Tying this together with some earlier threads -- QueeneMUSE quoted <br>
Michael Wiik as follows, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Doesn't most real estate property derive (at some point in the past) </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; from a coercive takeover of the land? If the King of France </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bequeaths to some nobleman some land (which the King obtained &amp; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; maintained by coercion), does the nobleman's descendents hundreds </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of years down the line have a real right to the property? </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I asked this a couple of years ago, but never got what I considered a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; satisfactory response.</i><br>
<p>
and then she said: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... and chances are that you won't. Unless it is of the type </i><br>
<i>&gt; Twirlip of Greymist gave, which states that is sucks and is </i><br>
<i>&gt; undesirable, but necessary.  Or the type that Sarash Naidu states, </i><br>
<i>&gt; that it sucks and must be abolished. </i><br>
<p>
This is what Twirlip actually said:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My 'solution' to the property question is that it does depend on force,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and yeah that kind of sucks in a way, but I don't see any alternative.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, violence does kind of suck in a way.  It has its good points, too.  <br>
Late 20th century white Americans are as ignorant about violence <br>
as the Victorians were ignorant about sex.  That will change. <br>
<p>
What really sucks is the situation we are in today, where we are <br>
held down by laws like Gulliver tied by the Lilliputians.<br>
<p>
As  &gt;H  becomes a reality, a new nobility will emerge, just as violent <br>
as the old nobility.  We will see the dawn of a new Imperialist era.  <br>
The Eagles will fly.  <br>
<p>
Lyle's test:  An entity is a  &gt;H  if it can ignore the law.  If it can escape <br>
from any cage you try to put it in, then it's transhuman.  <br>
<p>
