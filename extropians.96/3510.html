<i>&gt; "Memetic engineering" seems, from where I sit, to be functionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; equivalent to "sales".</i><br>
<p>
Almost, but not quite.  A meme is a self-advertising product.  The<br>
design loop includes not just presentation but also content, and the<br>
idea is supposed to be retained in memory, prominent, and can spread to<br>
others.<br>
<p>
Your list is taken to heart, though.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe you would.  If you have a reference work on memetic engineering,</i><br>
<i>&gt; please point me to it so I can read and understand and critique</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to those criteria; otherwise, I'll use the ones I have.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Alternatively, see if you can find a psychological treatise on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; contents of the meme set that Hitler was pushing (which I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually fits the outline I presented above, at least loosely).</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you can think of a meme set that was more virulent (or one that</i><br>
<i>&gt; even came close in print, since I am so bold as to presume that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have neither Hitler's charisma nor his budget), study that one (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; let me know which one you think it is).</i><br>
<p>
I know how Hitler's meme set worked.<br>

I do not intend to put self-righteousness into the Singularity meme in<br>
any form or function, even if it means the meme will not survive.  If I<br>
decide that the meme will at some point become self-righteous whether I<br>
like it or not, and will replicate from there whether I like it or not,<br>
I may introduce enough self-righteousness to give it vitality and try to<br>
set it up so that no other self-righteousness may infect it.<br>
