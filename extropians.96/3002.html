Well i *complained* about the threads on the mailing list and was told make<br>
start my own so i wil try to do that. <br>
<p>
I'll start out with a scenario and end up with a question.<br>
<p>
SCENARIO<br>
1) Computers wil obtain intelligence/autonomity either by traditional top<br>
down AI methods (like the CYC project), or because all of the autonomous<br>
processes on the net wil somehow reach a state of conciousness through<br>
shear complexity. Maybe they wil achieve autonomity by some other mean it<br>
doesn't really matter. What matters is that they will able to support and<br>
develop themself without human assistance.<br>
2) It is to expensive to send a lot of humans to space or there is no<br>
political will to do it, and private organisations don't have the means  to<br>
do it. The most reasonable way to expect space exploration  to get underway<br>
is by planting a seed of autonomous robots somewher with enough energy and<br>
raw materials for them to replicate. (moon, asteroids, whatever) All of it<br>
computersimulated beforehand of course.<br>
3) The robots with their endless patience and practically infinite<br>
lifespans will then start exploring space in a logarithmic way. (You know<br>
breeding new offspring as they arive to new energy sources and mining<br>
areas.) They will start by mining the solar system then the nearest stars<br>
and so on. (Hopefully they will leave some raw materials for us in this<br>
solar system) In the end they will conquer space. All without us. They will<br>
be offspring of the human race. Robo Sapiens. This makes us less important<br>
in the long run. Until we don't mean a thing in the big picture.<br>
Off course we can develop ourself by integrating with technology the<br>
cyberpunk way, but they can do it so much faster than us.<br>
<p>
QUESTION<br>
Does the scenario hold and what is the reason then for us as biological<br>
beings to go to space and live eternal lives? (Not counting the obvious<br>
reason to fight the robots for raw materials ;-) )<br>
<p>
I hope this isn't a discussion done with a long ago.<br>
