John K Clark says,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The true price of an object is determined by an enormous number of variables</i><br>
<i>&gt;and is much too complicated to be calculated from first principles, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;the market will tell you what the price should be, no trouble at all.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that government price-fixing is doomed to fail due to the complexity<br>
of the economy.<br>
<p>
But, think about how the market works.  It is like a system of nonlinear<br>
simultaneous equations -- it determines the "correct" price for item X,<br>
based on the prices for items Y, Z, etc.; and based on the culture of<br>
the society in questions (which determines the average, variance, etc.<br>
of the psychology of the individuals in the society).<br>
<p>
We all know that a system of nonlinear simultaneous equations can have<br>
MORE THAN ONE SOLUTION.  The market finds ONE OF THEM -- which is better<br>
than state price-fixing does.  But I do not believe that the price-level<br>
attractor found by a market is necessarily "good" just because it is a<br>
moderately wide-basined attractor of some dynamical system in price<br>
space.  <br>
<p>
Economic theory is just now emerging from a century or more of linear<br>
thinking.  If we accept that the economy is best modeled as a nonlinear<br>
system (a complex system) then we have to accept that there may be<br>
MANY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS to problems such as <br>
	-- pricing a given collection of goods in a given society<br>
	-- organizing a society to as to maximize productivity,<br>
		opportunity, standard of living [fill in your favorite<br>
		goals here]<br>
<p>
And we have to ask: are the solutions that happen to get converged to<br>
necessarily the BEST ones?  To assume that they are, which seems to be<br>
the line of John Clark and some others on this listserver, is just a<br>
variation on Pangloss with his "This is the best of all possible worlds."<br>
What you are saying is "In a complex system, whatever attractor we happen<br>
to sink into most often is the best one."  WHY?  WHY?  WHY?<br>
