Snip of a debate between Saresh and John (Leftilib vs. Anarcaprocy)<br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;How many children don't get an education because they have</i><br>
to work in sweatshops in order to support themselves. India is a good example<br>
of capitalism running amuck. <br>
                      <br>
( John)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their</i><br>
children less than we do? The reason they send their young children to work<br>
in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and death,  you've<br>
said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to<br>
stop this child labor, the thing that let's them survive, and that doesn't<br>
 seem like a very smart thing to do, and it CERTAINLY doesn't seem very<br>
humane.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Neither is child labor.  It was once a problem here as well,  we outlawed<br>
here in the US.  It rouses people's sensibilities and therefore is a typical<br>
( and in my opinion viable) argument against deregulation and anarchy.  It<br>
could be somewhat contraversial but it still does not address the real<br>
dilemna.<br>
 <br>
It seems as though the major ( and oft repeated) spiral I see here is simple:<br>
 either we should or shouldn't ( it could be argued as CAN or CAN'T) protect<br>
the "starving ( read uneducated) masses" from the (dishonest) greed of<br>
others. One crucial element , and one I keep harping on is how one envisions<br>
*changing* the moral systems that keep people doing what they are doing...<br>
     <br>
  Saresh, you seem to feel that these people are too dumb and/or helpless to<br>
take care of thier own needs or political choices and you and the govt. you<br>
subscribe to will make their choices for them.  John you seem to think that<br>
they are capable and  already fully aware of the choices that they make and<br>
have the critical faculties and/or ability to empower<br>
themselves and do that which is in their best interests.<br>
<p>
I say that with current memes (including, in India for example,  Hinduism and<br>
other religions that assert that suffering is a good thing, or one's proper<br>
place in the scheme of things) give us access to a vast "meme- deficiency"<br>
data base that needs to be addressed.  If we're going to survive and flourish<br>
in an anarcho-capitalist freedom, I propose that  most of the developed<br>
planet needs a big Codependant's Anonymous meeting, and the rest of the (3rd<br>
world?) planet needs to go to Catholics Anonymous(or substitue any mindless<br>
acceptance of suffering and subordination with the promise of a better<br>
afterlife) .<br>
