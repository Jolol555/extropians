<i>&gt; How about starting a memetic toolkit for Extropians/transhumans?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sort of a Q&amp;A page. A listing of the ususal objections people have against</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ideas and some arguments that have worked against them.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes!  Epistemology is important, and the constant barrage of<br>
ungrounded ideas, loose associations, and bad conclusions that pass<br>
for it in forums like this and Usenet calls for response.<br>
<p>
I happen to think that the best system found so far for controlled<br>
exercise of reason is the open adversarial system of trials in <br>
English common law (our own court system).  It fits especially well<br>
with pan-critical rationalist epistemology, because its central<br>
technique is not a justificationist argument, but a critical cross<br>
examination.  John Allen Paulos proposed something like a "science<br>
court" where advocates not only argued thier positions, but could<br>
also question each other and the others' witnesses.<br>
<p>
Such an exercise might make an interesting document.  Pick a small<br>
number of propositions; find pro and con advocates; let the advocates<br>
draft opening arguments, look at and criticize each others, redraft<br>
them, refine the proposition as necessary, question each other and<br>
the others' evidence, re-examine the answers and follow up, take<br>
questions from a panel of observers chosen adversarially, and let<br>
all of this happen at the level of "discovery"--i.e., not in "open"<br>
court, but in a private forum where the advocates can polish their<br>
final arguments for the show--where all the arguments are edited,<br>
all the questions known and prepared for, and which becomes the<br>
final publication (along with the refined proposition, a list of<br>
stipulations, etc.)<br>
<p>
The propositions need not be scientific; in fact, such propositions<br>
would probably be so one-sided that they would be settled early.<br>
Ethical propositions would be interesting, but they should be <br>
narrowly-focused, specific ones, not generalities.<br>
<p>
Any resources I can lend to such an effort (my Web site, my<br>
services as advocate or organizer) are hereby offered.<br>
