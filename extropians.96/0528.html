Excellent point.  In this case, the sum is greater than the whole of its<br>
parts.  Although we know that conciousness is 'merely' made up of many<br>
chemicals and substances, something must be said for every concious move we<br>
make.  The fact that I know that I am I and not a just a bunch of chemicals<br>
proves that in this case, the sum is greater.  1010010101101001010101?<br>
Frankly, I know that I am more than that.<br>
