<i> &gt;I've never been able to switch on the "creative" mode at will -- other than</i><br>
 <br>

<p>
  As a professional artist it is not an option whether or not one can switch<br>
it on or not, one must. Developing the discipline of making creative "moods"<br>
a non issue is as much a part of being an artist as learning to use the<br>
medium or software or oils and varnishes...<br>
<p>
Sleep is certainly detrimental to getting much art done, so I try to avoid it<br>
for my most productive hours ; - )<br>
<p>
You may look for ways in which dreamlike states can be induced, if that is<br>
what you mean by sleep... For example, I find a "flow" state can be reached<br>
by becoming very very good at a particular skill or task and then pushing my<br>
limit as hard as I can without getting into anxiety. I then sort of "bliss<br>
out" on the task at hand, and it becomes not only effortless, but a euphoric<br>
kind of high. <br>
 Also turning on rythmic music, burning sage, bodywork, exercise and dance<br>
often "loosen up" my ego enough that I can "get out of the way" of my own<br>
creativity.<br>
<p>
I find clamping down on myself in a critical way to be the biggest block to<br>
creativity, so I try to find ways to divert that kind of thinking.<br>
 .<br>
The other thing is to avoid people who make you crazy, and to be very selfish<br>
about your time and how you work - making it a safe and sane environment to<br>
relax so the "flow" state can be induced without interruptions or unwarranted<br>
criticisms which will interfere with the process. <br>
<p>
Also- and most importantly - I dont NOT so art just because I "feel" like I<br>
am not in a creative mood, I cant afford it, so often I will just work<br>
through this noncreative mode and into the creative flow. If I find myself "<br>
not in the mood" for art, I will work anyway.Doing less important things like<br>
priming canvas or enhancing image files , correcting colors, stuff like that,<br>
until my mind finally "switches " back to a creative mode.<br>
<p>
I dont know about offices, never worked in one,  but there are probably rules<br>
against body massage or loud music... but you might find some fun diversions<br>
to make you feel relaxed and flowful.... : )<br>
