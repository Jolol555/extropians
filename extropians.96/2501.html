My suggestion is that you start out with _Neverness_, the "zeroth" book of<br>
his current trilogy (_The Broken God_, _The Wild_, &lt;upcoming&gt;), it is IMHO<br>
the best of the books and explains the world much better than the rest. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; These days I seem to prefer hard SF or outright fantasy.  Both _Fire_</i><br>
<i>&gt; and _The Wild_ are books which find wonder and magic in extrapolating</i><br>
<i>&gt; known technology, but which are flawed from the 'hard' viewpoint.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; the flaws serve different purposes.  Zindell's mystical garnishes seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; intended to enhance the magical flavor of the book, but they end up</i><br>
<i>&gt; distracting and cheapening what derives from the harder nanotech/AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; developments.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I think Zindell has a more serious purpose in his magical style.<br>
He isn't trying to write about the real functioning of his universe (as<br>
hard sf tries to do), what interests him are deeper philosophical<br>
questions and the development of a transhumanist myth. The real plot of<br>
_The Wild_ is about Danlo's growth into a "true human" (whatever that is; <br>
I find him sometimes nauseatingly saintly), while _Neverness_ dealt with a<br>
human's growth into a god. These themes are perhaps possible to deal with<br>
in hard sf, but Zindell choose a looser style since it suited him (and it<br>
may make the myth stronger). <br>
