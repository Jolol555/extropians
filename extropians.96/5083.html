<p>
How many transhumans does it take to change a litebulb ?<br>
<p>
- 1. But first, he needs to figure out what the litebulb wants to change into.<br>
<p>
<p>
logic:<br>
<p>
Why did the transhuman cross the road ?<br>
<p>
- so he could cross the next road. <br>
<p>
<p>
technology:<br>
<p>
A robot, a posthuman, a transhuman and a member of the natural law party are<br>
in a small space station around proxima centauri 2. Suddenly the computer<br>
shows a defect to the thrusters and their orbit begins to decay. The<br>
estimated time for the computer to finish repairs, is slightly longer than<br>
the time it takes for the space station to burn up in the atmosphere. The<br>
robot rationally makes the suggestion that someone should jump out to slow<br>
the decaying process. The posthuman picks up the robot and throws it out,<br>
saying 'we have no need for that 'thing' anyway'. They make the computer<br>
recalculate, but it shows they are still too heavy. The transhuman kicks out<br>
the posthuman, and says to the natural law party member:'we have no need for<br>
that 'thing' anyway'. Again they feed in the new data but the computer shows<br>
that they are still about 50 pounds too heavy to complete repairs in time.<br>
The natural law party member picks up the computer and throws it out: 'we<br>
have no need for that 'thing' anyway'...<br>
