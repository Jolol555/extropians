<i>&gt; Do you really think anyone could keep hundreds of US sailors quiet after they</i><br>
<i>&gt; witnessed one of their own missiles shoot down a civilian plane?    Three</i><br>
<i>&gt; drinks along and the story would have been blurted out in any Norfolk bar.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This Salinger story is the Zimmerman Telegram of the 1990's and is a French</i><br>
<i>&gt; design to keep the US out of Africa and the Middle East.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is extremely naive.  Hundreds of US sailors of the USS Liberty,<br>
which had been attacked by Israel (with rockets, cannon, napalm and<br>
torpedoes) in 1967, were kept quiet for years under penalty of<br>
court-martial and long sentences in the brig.  They suffered 34 dead and<br>
171 wounded!  Americans never learned the truth until Jim Ennes' book<br>
came out in '79--12 years later.<br>
<p>
Did any sailor who took part in the shooting down of the Iranian Airbus<br>
ever say a word?  Or the ones on the USS Stark who were attacked by our<br>
ally, Iraq?  An inquiry was conducted by the navy but we never heard the<br>
results.<br>
<p>
What about the sailors on the destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin, which was<br>
supposedly attacked by N. Vietnam?  Did they ever say a word about it?<br>
This phony attack started the Vietnam War.<br>
<p>
What about all the attacks our wonderful boys conducted against the<br>
German and Japanese navies while we were "neutral" in 1940-41?  Did one<br>
of them ever say a word about it?<br>
<p>
What about the navy personnel who participated in the autopsy of JFK at<br>
Bethesda Naval Hospital?<br>
<p>
The writer has no idea of the fear which the military can create in its<br>
personnel, or how low it will stoop to create that fear.<br>
<p>
This is the same US Navy which framed a dead victim of its negligence in<br>
the explosion of the USS Iowa's gun turret.  Not only did they frame him<br>
but, for good measure, said he was a homosexual to boot.<br>
<p>
Anyway, how do we really know that there was only one US ship within 180<br>
miles of Long Island that evening?  All we know is what the navy tells<br>
us, and the navy tells us they didn't do it.  That doesn't mean they did,<br>
but it doesn't mean they didn't, either.<br>
