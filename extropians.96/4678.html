<i>&gt;&gt; Although a magnesium/manganese dioxide/potassium chlorate mixture doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; have any explosive properties, it is *very* exothermic.  Thermite+.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Definitely a lot of fun.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, it was seriously explosive. An enclosed spoonful or so (I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;know the exact amount since a friend with a death wish did the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;mixing) was enough to blow a coconut and a silly hat into oblivion, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;leave a one meter wide crater in packed soil. </i><br>
<p>
Hmmm... Something isn't consistent here.  If there was an explosion, it<br>
would have to be mostly due to the extremely exothermic nature of the<br>
mixture.  The only component capable of explosion is potassium chlorate,<br>
which tends to be a pretty poor explosive, *especially* without the presence<br>
of an organic fuel.  It was probably a mostly exothermic explosion (as<br>
opposed to deflagration or detonation).<br>
<p>
Which leads me to question the one meter wide crater.  Unless the charge was<br>
buried, this number is *way* too large.  Using military explosives, this<br>
would require a block of TNT, which has an order of magnitude more power<br>
than potassium chlorate under the best of circumstances.  The crater may<br>
have seemed large at the time, though.  Either that or there was *a lot*<br>
more than a couple spoonfuls of the chlorate mixture.  What kind of depth<br>
did you get?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I assume the potassium chlorate was to make ignition easier?  I certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; commend you on your choice of manganese dioxide.  Not the most commonly used</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; metal oxide, but definitely the best for this application.  Net thermal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; output is 25-35% higher than iron oxides.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, the idea was to use the catalytic reaction between the manganese </i><br>
<i>&gt;dioxide and the chlorate that releases oxygen; I guessed it would make </i><br>
<i>&gt;the otherwise strong magnesium-chlorate reaction stronger. In retrospect, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I doubt that was the real reaction, but the combination was definitely </i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful. And it made me nervous, I have never liked chlorates...</i><br>
<p>
Chlorates are very unstable.  Can't be mixed with ammonium salts or anything<br>
with sulfur unless you have a death wish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 1) Replace magnesium with aluminum.  A little harder to ignite, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; significantly boosts the thermal output.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One fun experiment we did (it was a young scientist association in </i><br>
<i>&gt;southern Stockholm) was to make thermite using copper oxides. It managed </i><br>
<i>&gt;to vaporize coke cans quite nicely.</i><br>
<p>
And I think it ignites easier too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ah, the reckless days of highschool. I still remember when one experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;blew up, set fire to a small field of grass and rained metal pieces over a</i><br>
<i>&gt;large area. The police arrived, only to find a group of youngsters in</i><br>
<i>&gt;white lab coats carrying electric gear and gas masks (another of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;less-than-safe inventions: yellow cadmium fog) arguing about how much zinc</i><br>
<i>&gt;there ought to have been in the mixture. They just looked pained when we</i><br>
<i>&gt;started to explain :-)</i><br>
<p>
Hehehe!<br>
<p>
I was fortunate in that I lived in a rural area during most of my<br>
experimentation.  No one cared what we did out there.<br>
<p>
One of my horror stories was I accidentally discovered (very<br>
unintentionally!) how to spontaneously and rapidly decompose nitric acid.<br>
The red, noxious cloud of nitrogen trioxide would have covered a city block,<br>
all from 250mL of nitric acid.  Thankfully, my parents weren't home at the<br>
time.  Interesting reaction.  Nothing happens for 10 or 15 minutes and then<br>
suddenly... (When synthesizing PETN, follow the temperature recommendations<br>
*precisely*!)<br>
