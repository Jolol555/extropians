You have a very general idea about how it works but not for specific examples, <br>
and God is in the details. A child would say, I know how a computer can do <br>
arithmetic, you plug it in, turn it on, type in the problem, and that causes <br>
the answer to appear on the screen. The child would be perfectly correct too, <br>
as far as it goes. You and I have a little deeper understanding about what<br>
is going on, but not deep enough.<br>
                    <br>

                   <br>
<p>
You're saying that if we don't understand what a machine does we couldn't <br>
design it. The same child could design a machine that will move an object in  <br>
water and create a turbulent flow. Do you understand turbulence?<br>

Well, sometimes it can do exactly that, but it all depends on how good a  <br>
student you are, how well you understand the subject of your study.<br>
                   <br>

Yes, I wrote several rather long posts on this very subject in the past year, <br>
if there is any interest I could re-send them.<br>
