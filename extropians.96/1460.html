        Thanks for that.  There was one thing I forgot to mention.  Having a<br>
transhuman\extropian art ML shouldn't bar art threads from the other lists.<br>
I think that art threads on the transhuman ML and the extropian ML are<br>
great. They most certainly would have a larger audience, as well as maintain<br>
an artistic 'left brain' side to both lists.  My suggestion for having TEAML<br>
(acronym), is for the ones who would enjoy topics centered on &gt;H and<br>
extropian art.  My intention for the list is having it more as a specific<br>
forum --kind of like having a cryonics or nanotechnology ML.  Most who would<br>
be on the TEAML would (and should) probably be on the &gt;H or extropian list<br>
as well.  I presume there would not be too many messages per day...enough to<br>
warrant a mailing list of this sort.<br>

        <br>
        I'm sure there's another art ML somewhere; probably quite a few art<br>
MLs, but nothing like a transhuman\extropian art ML.  The main reason I am<br>
subscribed to the transhuman and extropian lists is because I agree with the<br>
vast majority of the topics conveyed.  Brain candy.  However, a scientist I<br>
am not, an artist I am.  Why I would like to see TEAML get off the ground<br>
(pun definately intended :-)) is because I know that the ones subscribed<br>
will have very similar opinions as my own.  People who share the same<br>
philosophical meme as me will have more of an understanding of what I am<br>
trying to convey.  If I was to use the word 'automorph' (coined by our good<br>
friend Natasha V. More --extropian artist extraordinaire) in one of my poems<br>
and place it on another art ML, most -if not all- readers wouldn't be able<br>
to grok it.  As is, a few of my poems such as "Unanimous Consent", "Best Do<br>
It So", and "Casual Nobility" among others have brought forth comments of<br>
misunderstanding by the readers.  If there was a mailing list for transhuman<br>
and extropian artists, there would be a forum for knowledgable discussion of<br>
artwork --both from on and off the list.  In effect, I have just gotten back<br>
from a bit of a weekend 'sojourn' and I will continue my research on MLs and<br>
carry on with my FAQ.  Responses of any sort are always highly valued.<br>
