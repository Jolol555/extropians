Steve Witham:<br>
&lt;It's the sea of information that any intelligence that evolves to<br>
something like this point will want to colonize.  Not good old 3D space.<br>
 Not particularly *not* 3-space either, the point is just that it's the<br>
universe as information, not volume or mass per se, that matters ...<br>
Life evolves to become efficiently-encoded information, which looks like<br>
sunlight and dirt.&gt;<br>
<p>
Robin Hanson:<br>
&lt;I'd expect an advanced computer to notice if some external force<br>
started to much around with its innards, and to do something about it.<br>
So if the world around us is an advanced computer, it knows about us and<br>
chooses for some reason to allow our activities to continue. Either we<br>
are part of this computation, or it works around us.&gt;<br>
<p>
Can anything humans do really be considered the application of an<br>
external force? If the universe is some sort of giant irreducible<br>
computation, we are, of course, part of it.  Compared to any 'higher<br>
levels' of this system, we are perceived, perhaps, at the same level<br>
that we perceive our own intestinal fauna.<br>
<p>
Robin:<br>
&lt;How much physics do you know Steve?&gt;<br>
<p>
Most of the people writing about the universe as a 'computation' or "sea<br>
of information" are physicists; e.g., Paul Davies _The Mind of God_,<br>
Fred Alan Wolf _The Dreaming Universe_, Brian Josephson, David Bohm,<br>
Nick Herbert, and so on (though some of these do tend to get a little<br>
mystical).<br>
<p>
Robin:<br>
&lt;I'm not sure you realize how very much we do know about all that<br>
information streaming around us.  We know which systems are exchanging<br>
bits with each other, and how fast, and where this arrangement changes,<br>
etc.  We also know a lot about designing computers, carefully arranging<br>
the routes and speeds of bit exchanges.  And these two really look<br>
nothing alike!&gt;<br>
<p>
Our current computers are optimized for serial, not parallel<br>
computations, have inadequate associative memories, and are pitiful at<br>
communications.<br>
<p>
What we know is only a tiny fraction of what we have yet to learn. How<br>
much do we really know about the initial conditions of the many chaotic<br>
biological and economic systems that we're still just identifying?<br>
<p>
I just happened* to reread something that physicist John Cramer wrote<br>
(in his 3/92 Analog column): "Chaos can be removed, reduced, or steered<br>
by monitoring and feedback or by introducing periodic perturbations of a<br>
carefully chosen frequency."<br>
<p>
(* Thanks to Damien Broderick for the URL:<br>
www.npl.washington.edu/AV/av_index_sub.html)<br>
<p>
And then, Robin:<br>
&lt;Last year the Econ Nobel went for Game Theory, this year for Mechanism<br>
Design, both areas I've been specializing in.  Maybe next year they'll<br>
do signaling games.&gt;<br>
<p>
I read the Academy page and noted that they said: "Incomplete and<br>
asymmetrically distributed information has fundamental consequences,<br>
particularly in the sense that an informational advantage can often be<br>
exploited strategically."  I assume that by "Mechanism Design" and<br>
"signaling games" you're referring to approaches for controling these<br>
chaotic, natural systems.<br>
<p>
But, as Cramer noted in that same article:<br>
&lt;What's going to happen when traders realize that they can steer and<br>
control the fluctuations of the market by introducing periodic<br>
perturbation ... when the trick is learned and many operators are doing<br>
it, the effects will be cancel out and the Market, 'efficient' as<br>
always, will go its own way.&gt;<br>
<p>
Anyway, while studying "the routes and speeds of bit exchanges", might<br>
give us clues on how to control or optimize them, it doesn't tell us<br>
much about the application being performed or its relation to other<br>
applications.  I'm certaintly not going to be just looking at the<br>
circuitry and electron flows in my computer to find out what it's doing.<br>
<p>
Another example: when we look at a Penrose tiling (like the cover of the<br>
latest Science News), we can either notice the individual tiles<br>
themselves and the rules by which they can be connected, or we can see<br>
the overlapping and repeating patterns that they make on the larger<br>
scale.  Both views have utility.<br>
<p>
I think Lyle's point ('made-to-order cells', Monday, October 14, 1996<br>
4:43PM) is relevant here:<br>
&lt;Eric Drexler envisions little assembler arms picking atoms up and<br>
putting them in place, one by one.  In cells, atoms are guided into<br>
place by their three-dimensional environment ... It is possible to do<br>
the same thing with cellular machinery that Edison and others did with<br>
electrical machinery a hundred years ago.&gt;<br>
<p>
Nature uses a cellular automata with genetic algorithms approach.  The<br>
Drexlerian approach requires a pre-defined, step-by-step program.  While<br>
this might be the most efficient, it's certaintly not the most flexible.<br>
 I suspect we'll eventually combine both approaches where appropriate.<br>
<p>
Steve Witham:<br>
&lt;I would expect a colonized universe to look exactly like a barren one.&gt;<br>
<p>
Robin:<br>
&lt;To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an optimum design<br>
for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.&gt;<br>
<p>
What is "an optimum design"? Would it do away with redundancy? Would it<br>
be based on crystalline rather than fractal patterns?<br>
<p>
Robin:<br>
&lt;It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the<br>
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the<br>
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,<br>
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years. That<br>
huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new technology, so<br>
some of your descendants become as advanced as your advanced enemies.&gt;<br>
<p>
How is this different from Vernor Vinge's Blight? The image I get from<br>
this is a homogenous nanofog out to conquer the universe, leaving in its<br>
wake only a Black Goo, or less, converting everything to its<br>
pre-programmed optimal design.  How would such a system have any<br>
creativity and what "new technology" could it ever develop?<br>
<p>
I'd expect a colonized universe of this type to look very barren, more<br>
like a black hole or a 'premature' Omega Point.<br>
<p>
Mark Crosby<br>
<p>
"My purpose in writing _Mind Tools_ has been to see what follows if one<br>
believes that everything is information. I have reached the following<br>
(debatable) conclusions: 1) The world can be resolved into digital bits,<br>
with each bit made of smaller bits. 2) These bits form a fractal pattern<br>
in fact-space. 3) The pattern behaves like a cellular automaton. 4) The<br>
pattern is inconceivably large in size and in dimensions. 5) Although<br>
the world started very simply, its computation is irreducibly<br>
complex.... And where is this huge computation taking place? Everywhere;<br>
it's what we're made of."<br>
