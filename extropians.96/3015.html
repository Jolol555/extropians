<i>&gt; I don't wanna start a thread about something obvious </i><br>
<i>&gt; that you allready are *done* discussing.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, consider Ray Peck's comment last Wednesday:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW, I find David's posts probably the most interesting and </i><br>
<i>&gt; thought provoking currently on the list.  That may be because </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been on the list for over 5 years, so I've seen most everything else </i><br>
<i>&gt; rehashed 12 times already!  ;-)  But I don't think so.  Kudos.  </i><br>
<p>
I have some threads in the works that should generate some sparks <br>
(for example  - "The Fuzzy Logic of Race"), but I am disheartened <br>
at the prospect of going around the same predictable circles, yet again.  <br>
These discussions have no structure and arrive at no conclusion.  <br>
"Wildgrowing" is an apt description.  <br>
<p>
On the other hand, even wildgrowing threads bear fruit.  I certainly <br>
agree that the TWA flight has been beaten to death, but even here an <br>
interesting point emerged.  I was struck by Mike Lorrey's statement <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was the key witness in a case in which two female airmen </i><br>
<i>&gt; framed a male airman with such claims. If I had not overheard them </i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about it beforehand, his life would be over.  </i><br>
<p>
and truly taken aback by James Rogers's confirmation, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I saw this twice in my relatively short military career.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I too was witness in one incident that the charges were intentionally </i><br>
<i>&gt; fabricated.  </i><br>
<p>
Wow.  I would never have been aware that this was happening <br>
if I hadn't taken the trouble to follow this prolix thread.  I have <br>
given up on the list as a philosophical forum but it still has its uses.  <br>
As David Musick wrote tonight, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My quality writings are an excercise for my mind, to develop </i><br>
<i>&gt; high quality, very articulate thinking.  </i><br>
<p>
Yep.  The way to be a writer is to write, and this is as good a place <br>
as any to practice.  But there is no use doing this (or anything else) <br>
halfway.  Posts written without discipline are a waste of everybody's <br>
time, not least the writer's.  (But of course everybody will think <br>
this latter remark must apply to someone other than himself.)  <br>
<p>
Whatever Extropians think, there is such a thing as real art, and <br>
there are real standards of logical structure and cogency in prose.  <br>
In the absence of an editor to set and enforce such standards, <br>
Gresham's law will ultimately prevail.    <br>

<i>&gt; Anyone here read Matt Ridley's "The Origin of Virtue" yet?  </i><br>
<p>
I saw an excerpt from it in FT and have been eagerly awaiting <br>
its appearance in the bookstores.  From the little bit I read, this is <br>
definitely something that has not been rehashed 12 times.  <br>
