<i>&gt;Anders is responding to your post! :-)</i><br>
Thanks<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think it is hard to start a discussion of this based just on HAARP, you </i><br>
<i>&gt;have to broaden the subject a bit to include other forms of climate </i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering, like seeding the seas with iron to cause algae blooms, </i><br>
<i>&gt;modifying albedo, "butterfly control" and causing/inhibiting cloud </i><br>
<i>&gt;formation. If you do this, I think you will get more people involved and </i><br>
<i>&gt;a higher likeliehood of creating a "critical mass" for the thread. </i><br>
<p>
I suppose you could control any greenhouse effect with seeding the ocean<br>
with iron for algae bloom and also I've read about them using silver nitrate<br>
injected into the I-wall of hurricanes to dissolve them but Cuba got upset<br>
since this experiment occurred around the cuban missile crisis and Cuba<br>
thought the US was attempting to learn ways of redirecting the hurricanes<br>
toward them. Pretty stupid to stifle research for that.<br>
