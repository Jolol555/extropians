<i>&gt;power represented by the probe's mass to produce the information</i><br>
<i>&gt;locally long before the information can be returned fromn an</i><br>
<i>&gt;extra-system source. That is, I see that one side of the discount</i><br>
<i>&gt;ration is very large, and I don't see any equivalent large value on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other side of the ratio.</i><br>
<p>
Not all information can be computed, if one doesn't have the right<br>
inputs.  Furthermore, even for stuff that can be computed, it's not<br>
clear there is some maximum computational "depth" (compute cycles over<br>
output + input length) It would be very interesting if you could prove<br>
that a computer has some universal minimum discount rate.  That would<br>
be well worth publishing.  However, it seems you are a long way from<br>
showing this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why do you think an SI will understand itself any more than we</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand ourselves?  And even if it could, that doesn't mean such</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding will lead to much improvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Basically, I don't believe that we understand the basics of human</i><br>
<i>&gt;cognition.Therefore our attempts at self-augmentation have no firm</i><br>
<i>&gt;basis.  We do, however, understand the basics of machine computation:</i><br>
<i>&gt;we can design and build more powerful computer hardware and software.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since we understand this basis already, I believe that an SI can also</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand it.  I believe that an SI with a computer component will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to design and build ever more powerful hardware and software,</i><br>
<i>&gt;thus increasing its own capabilities. I think that this is likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;lead not just to an improvement, but to a rapid feedback process.</i><br>
<p>
Consider an analogy with the world economy.  We understand the basics<br>
of this, and we can change it for the better, but this doesn't imply<br>
an explosive improvement.  Good changes are hard to find, and each one<br>
usually makes only a minor improvement.  It seems that, in contrast,<br>
you imagine that there are a long series of relatively easy to find<br>
"big wins".    If it turns out that our minds are rather badly<br>
designed, you may be right.  But our minds may be better designed than<br>
you think.  <br>
