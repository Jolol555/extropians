<i>&gt; } &gt;those storage capacitors are always so bulky. Seriously, Eric, anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt;who refuses to go armed gets the repression they deserve. if you live in</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt;that kind of neighborhood, not doing so is simple suicide in my book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have the impression that in most areas, most urban ones at least,</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting caught carrying a concealed weapon without a permit is rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal.  Such as a box cutter.  And in many areas getting such a permit</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- or permission to have a gun at all -- is hard.  One could estimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; the chance of running into a mugger in a situation where being invisibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; armed was useful as being less than the chance of police finding one's</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun somehow and getting upset.  And one could carefully live in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually good neighborhood and still get caught by the rare mugger.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
While the unconstitutional 5 day waiting period a la the Brady Bill is<br>
currently before the Supreme Court, even with such waiting periods,<br>
getting a concealed weapons permit is rather easy, so long as you have<br>
no criminal convictions. Even a felon who has no violence/weapons<br>
convictions can get a concealed weapons permit by going before a special<br>
board, in most jurisdictions. I've got one, my brother has one, as does<br>
my father.<br>
<p>
Even getting a federal firearms license, with an automatic weapons<br>
permit, allowing you to own, build, and sell to other permitted<br>
individuals and law enforcement offices fully automatic weapons is<br>
relatively easy, though the fee is a stiff $600. A freind of mine, the<br>
president of my local fish and game association, is an automatic weapons<br>
dealer. I've been out to his place to shoot Uzis, M-60s, and other<br>
custom exotics.<br>
<p>
It definitely is easier than it was to get a replacement SOcial Security<br>
Card this year...... many states and municipalities are passing "Right<br>
to Carry" concealed firearms laws now, and report that in their<br>
jurisdictions, the murder rate drops after such laws are passed.<br>
Florida, for example, passed such a law in 1994. The murder rate in<br>
FLorida dropped by 22% in 1995 over 1994. Since criminals do not get<br>
their guns by legal means, having an armed citizenry makes them think<br>
twice about committing offenses, for fear of getting shot. Most crooks<br>
know that merely getting arrested is a cakewalk. Getting shot on the<br>
spot with no trial is another thing entirely.<br>
<p>
THe only demographic group that is experiencing higher death rates from<br>
firearms is teenage males in urban areas, and they should not have<br>
access to guns in the first place given preexisting laws.<br>
