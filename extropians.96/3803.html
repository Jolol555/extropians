Certainly.  Humans obviously have a wider complex of values than<br>
animals.  One might well expect entities 'beyond' humans to have even<br>
more complex values which we can't understand -- in fact, that is exactly<br>
part of the strong Singularity.<br>

On the other hand, I have seen no evidence that human geniuses have more<br>
complex values than other humans.  Since I maintain that Powers would be<br>
*in principle* on our level, they needn't be any more ethically complex.<br>
Anyway, having complex values doesn't imply being ethical.<br>
