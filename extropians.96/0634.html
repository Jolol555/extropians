<p>
Howard Julien has already picked up on the generational context implicit in<br>
the choice of the word "they", so I'll only add my $.02 on that briefly:<br>
Careful what you say, sonny, *some* of your elders may be around for a *very*<br>
long time!  (Although in a thousand years or so, the generational differences<br>
may have finally receded into insignificance ...)<br>
<p>
Kidding aside, this is a good question.  For years I've actually had a<br>
feeling that the "boomers" haven't had their last big impact on history; that<br>
the "revolutionary" cultural impact of the post-war generation was really<br>
just lying dormant during the "middle" years when they have been preoccupied<br>
with establishing themselves in careers, mating (as opposed to coupling) and<br>
raising children.  There is a vast reservoir of experience with rejecting<br>
paradigms and experimenting with new ways of living and being that was<br>
amassed by the boomers in the 1960s and 1970s. It is likely to express itself<br>
again in new ways -- in fact it already is, in my opinion.<br>
<p>
The Boom generation was the first to explicitly espouse a "youth culture"<br>
and, in the mass-culture interest in fitness and youth-retention sweeping the<br>
industrialized West now, I think we see just the sort of (selfish) desire to<br>
reject traditional paradigms that has marked the Boomers since we first<br>
learned to talk.  I see this every day at the gym.  The place is full of<br>
folks my age and a little older, fighting *hard* to defeat the biological<br>
programming of the individual "life cycle".  This is in sharp contrast to the<br>
generation that preceded us, whose members accepted without question that one<br>
settled comfortably into the obesity of "middle age" and then the decrepitude<br>
of "old age".<br>
<p>
Of course, the Boomers have never been a cultural monolith, and the same will<br>
be true as we move into this new stage.  But I think the odds are very good<br>
that a significant minority of my generation, at least, will become<br>
increasingly interested in the issues we discuss here.<br>
<p>
Now, what do you young folks have to say for yourselves? ....<br>
