I too have noticed the overabundance of impulsive, non-quality posting and <br>
idle chit-chat in this forum.  I do my best to try and post high-quality, <br>
interesting posts, and I avoid responding to things unless I can somehow work <br>
my ideas into a high-quality, interesting post.<br>
<p>
To me, Extropy is very realated to the concepts of quality and excellence, and <br>
as a practicing Extropian, I work to acheive quality and excellence in <br>
everything I do.  From the way I wash my hands to the way I write, I practice <br>
acheiving quality and excellence in all of the little and big areas of my <br>
life.<br>
<p>
If we are truly Extropians, and if this is really a forum for Extropian <br>
discussion, we should make all our exchanges with each other through this <br>
forum as extropic as possible.  There are plenty of other mailing lists and <br>
discussion groups where people can engage in idle chit-chat and send impulsive <br>
messages to each other, but I feel it is innappropriate in this particular <br>
forum.  We are Extropians.  Lets act like it.<br>
<p>
I do my best to seed this forum with high quality posts and well-thought-out <br>
ideas.  I wish there were more people contributing excellent posts to this <br>
forum.  I wish I could read the mail from the Exi list and have it overflowing <br>
with interesting and thought-provoking ideas, rather than a lot of idle <br>
banter.  If you don't have something to write that you think will truly be <br>
interesting to those who read in this forum, please don't write anything; just <br>
read for a while, and then when you have something interesting you want to <br>
share, write it up well and then post it.<br>
<p>
We can make this one of the best, most extropic mailing lists on the Internet, <br>
but we must learn *discipline*.  And we must be committed to posting only <br>
good, quality writings.  As more people join this forum, the need for this <br>
will become more appearent, especially if one receives a few hundred messages <br>
a day, full of idle chit-chat about some inane topic.<br>
<p>
I've noticed that as I strive to write quality writings, the quality of my <br>
typical thoughts also rises.  My quality writings are an excercise for my <br>
mind, to develop high quality, very articulate thinking.  I urge the <br>
contributers to this list to practice writing high-quality writings.  It's <br>
very good for developing one's mind.<br>
