FOR E. SHAUN: <br>
<p>
<p>
When I was young I wondered about Mars,<br>
And daydreamed nightly of the stars, <br>
O!  What the future held in store, <br>
and forged a path of more.. more... more....<br>
<p>
But others didnt understand, <br>
I never chose to join thier band...<br>
They tried to tell me i was daft, <br>
but I just smiled, and calmly laughed.<br>
 ( OK I am tired of rhyming now)<br>
<p>
They always told me keep your head, <br>
keep your head, <br>
Hmmm....keep my head, I ponder...<br>
keep my head....<br>
<p>
I wandered far and foraged, found<br>
Someone who's books i so admired<br>
They had such wondrous things inside<br>
as made daydreams look pale as clouds...<br>
That shrunk vast egos small then built<br>
new nebuli <br>
Output cranked up and amplified.<br>
<p>
And if I kept my head alive,<br>
A heart, a brain, a cell to subdivide<br>
Just take my samples, keep me cold<br>
here's my two, my four, my hundreds more....<br>
<p>
Slice me thin, and put my input here...<br>
And don't forget my mom and sister dear....<br>
<p>
A dying girl, sat on her bed<br>
her doctor's voice rang in her head<br>
<p>
And when she was dead,<br>
They kept her head.<br>
