I thought you were claiming that what we observe, lots of random<br>
looking noise, supports the theory that advanced folks are hiding<br>
around us.  Now I see that you are only claiming evidential<br>
neutrality, that both this theory and its converse would predict the<br>
same observation.   <br>
<p>
If so, I will place my objections against the internal consistency of<br>
this theory.  As I elaborated in previous posts, I don't see why some<br>
of these advanced folks would put obvious colonies out at a distance,<br>
so see what sort of reaction they induce.  <br>
