So what kinds of diverse approaches do you folks when making time?  I <br>
know, this question is vague.  Maybe a general response will lead to more <br>
specific inquiry.  Any personal suggestions or references to liturature <br>
will be most appreciated.<br>

I was going to write a long reply to this, when I realized I don't <br>
have time right now. :) <br>
<p>
Seriously, one excellent thing to try is to keep your to-dos in a <br>
prune-able list right next to your calendar (assuming you keep a <br>
schedule); then be brutal--periodically (weekly?) go down your list <br>
of to-dos and either schedule a slice of time to _do_ each one, or <br>
remove it from the list. That's a form of "making" time--committing <br>
it.<br>
<p>
It can also be productive to assemble a circle of like-minded folks and <br>
essentially bet each other about how many "A' priorities you'll get <br>
done each week. At $1 (or $5 if you're a high roller) per missed <br>
commitment, some people get motivated...<br>
<p>
I'm currently in remission from tightly booked time, but I appear to <br>
be turning into a manager, so I'll probably relapse shortly. :)<br>
