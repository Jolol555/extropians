<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The September issue of Wired carried an article by</i><br>
<i>&gt; famous-as-a-visionary John Perry Barlow, entitled</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The Powers That Were". </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  JPB calls US democracy "Government by Hallucinating Mob,</i><br>
<i>&gt; driven mad by television", explaining that much of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge about current social issues is available to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public via advertisement-sponsored TV (and other mass media)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that selects both content and presentation with the goal to</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep the audience near their TV sets, so that they can see</i><br>
<i>&gt; more ads and make more money for advertisers and media owners.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As the result, juicy/silly non-issues manufactured for</i><br>
<i>&gt; keeping the lowest common denominator bottom glued to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; couch, steal public attention from real serious problems -</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then the populace elects its representatives to "handle"</i><br>
<i>&gt; these TV-induced collective hallucinations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Completely, the tool of government/corporate control is far subtle than<br>
the gun. Until people get off their soma-filled butts and start taking an<br>
active hand in their society, we will always find coercive authority<br>
present. &gt;<br>
   JPB suggests some observations on how U.S. got into this<br>
<i>&gt; pitiful state, and ideas on how the Cyberspace can help</i><br>
<i>&gt; restructure social knowledge-delivery and decision-making</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanisms.   He does not mention ACF - though, in my opinion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ACF has the potential of playing a very significant role in</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent demassifying and fine-tuning of the architecture</i><br>
<i>&gt; of social conversation.</i><br>
I agree, although it is not going that way currently. Much like the<br>
Internet was hyped as a true "grassroots" media, with the individual<br>
engaged in true two-way conversation. I still hold this hope, although<br>
with the advent of the web and decline of usenet, I doubt it will happen.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Now, the question is, will the ACF developers</i><br>
steer their &gt; technology towards commercial goals, trying to develop<br>
<i>&gt; "personalized glues" to paste each individual bottom to its</i><br>
<i>&gt; couch, and deliver whatever-pleases-you-personally to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; you in front of the screen even longer and see more - and</i><br>
<i>&gt; better targeted - ads  than TV ever could - and make still</i><br>
<i>&gt; more money?  Or will ACF system development be based on an</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort to leverage the potential of the technology for</i><br>
<i>&gt; intentional social engineering?</i><br>
If you give the technology to the hands of the people, not the elites,<br>
then you will find true social change occuring. Unless the media as a<br>
whole becomes a<br>
forum for debate rather than advertising, any new media will be tdominated<br>
by conglomerates. The thing is, government is too incompetent to effect<br>
this, and corporations are too selfish. &gt; <br>
<i>&gt;   My expectation is that this will be business-as-usual:</i><br>
<i>&gt; efforts will be made to make money, but the resulting</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology will have some social-restructuring side-effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The cultural consequences should be somewhat beneficial - this</i><br>
<i>&gt; time.  We just seem to be lucky to live in the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; period when the irresponsible-as-usual development happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; to bring positive results. It started recently and may end</i><br>
<i>&gt; well within our lifetimes.  Maybe, by that time we'll learn</i><br>
<i>&gt; to rely more on vision than on luck.   Maybe, not.</i><br>
I certainly hope so<br>
