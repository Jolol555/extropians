I think this might be just the view of a few.  Certainly, by &gt;having a<br>
 Transhumanist Art list, anyone who does not have a strong background in<br>
art,or art hisory and art theory can join &gt;in and learn.  This would be<br>
really great and much needed. <br>
<p>
Perhaps when i return you and I can sit down and see about starting a forum<br>
for futurist art, you havent the time, and yet it is your concept in so many<br>
ways... I am skeptical about the embryonic stage of the sci/art connections,<br>
but yes, perhaps it is a way for people to ( if nothing else) lurk and learn<br>
til they are ready to contribute ( which is what I did for the &gt;H and<br>
Extropian lists).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Certainly, art has value and meaning.  How many</i><br>
would join?  Well, perhaps a lot of artists! <br>
<p>
   You are right! It may be a way to encourage artists to become interested<br>
in Extropy.... we can use the brain power.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Let anyone who isn't an artist read the list guidelines and FAQ list to</i><br>
learn terms first to learn a few references. I find that some of previous<br>
confusion was because words are<br>
used differently in different professions/disciplines and _also_ that, in<br>
general, people have different reference points from which to draw ideas and<br>
criticism.  If someone has never seen or read about a specific style of art,<br>
how on earth can he or she discuss it intelligently?  <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you, but is a bit beside the point - exept for those few ( and<br>
you know who you are) who speak *authoratively* on the subject when it is<br>
quite clear they arent experts. <br>
<p>
I hope the scientists, social scientists, techwriters, programmers, engineers<br>
and philosophers would also be freely encouraged to join in, on any level<br>
they want - knowledge or none - as long as they arent *attacking* the<br>
criteria.. <br>
After all, one will certainly find more engineers who know a little about art<br>
history than artists who know a little about neurobiology. <br>
Personally  I find it much more interesting to learn from the technogeeks and<br>
futurist philosophers, since I know a lot about art already!!<br>
