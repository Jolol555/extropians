<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;information (as opposed to copying) is a fundamental limitation of all </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;information systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; We can still live in a virtual world though with the laws of physics</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; altered at our whims and AI civilizations created and destroyed for your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; entertainment. (Oh no! Here comes the AI civil liberties organization!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; In this scenario we do have the choice of either being a brain in a jar</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with i/o streams feeding into a PC or we can augment our existing body</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; everyway we can think of and have a brain-PC interface builtin to our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; genome such as communication with a PC via bat radar signals or tendrils on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the back of the neck which are a direct link to our brain. If this is true,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it doesn't matter much to me because I'd be satisfied with the 'greek god'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; idea because I could still create entire universes in a virtual world as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; well as have access to the continuously growing pool of human intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; plus gain immortality. Can silicon actually support life? If this is true</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that we are required to 'move' data then Strong AI will never come about or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; live in a quasi-consciousness where it continually lives/dies/lives/dies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; John, I'm looking for a reply on this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Being able to "jack in" to cyberspace is only marginally useful if </i><br>
<i>&gt;you don't have the processing power to go with it.  Sure, you may </i><br>
<i>&gt;have access to vast quantities of information, but if you are still </i><br>
<i>&gt;processing it or thinking about it at tissue speeds then you aren't </i><br>
<i>&gt;much better off.</i><br>
<p>
Why not come up with a bio/silicon brain which contains bits of both so as<br>
to speed up the whole. Both bio and silicon both have their pros so why not<br>
add both together and make one dual medium (dm) brain.<br>
