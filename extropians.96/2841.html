Caveats: It depends, whether strong (Drexlerian) nanotech is workable, <br>
furthermore on continuing availability of biocompatible habitats, which <br>
is not certain, should inner planets of our system to become disassembled.<br>

Yes, drastically so.<br>

Absolutely.<br>

<p>
It depends on the cell damage. A dry, rigid system, which operates by <br>
mechanosynthesis has got some problems in a wet, squishy body. It can't <br>
achieve atomic resolution, because the stuff is so wobbly, but it will <br>
detect macroscopic defects, even misfolded proteins. It's pretty big, so <br>
it has to elbow away cells on its way. It will need infrastructure to be <br>
provided with fuel from an external source (orelse you'll need to eat <br>
_huge_ meals) as well as pipelines to access prefab stuff from caches, it <br>
will need means of communication with its kin (emergent behaviour of agent <br>
clusters).<br>

Right.<br>

It depends whether Singularity will zoom its blue-shifted streak across <br>
the sky and transcends quietly, or remains linked to matter, busily <br>
gnawing away at easily accesible resources first, disassembling even <br>
relatively inaccesible things at the bottow of gravity wells later. <br>
Whether the Powers will remember their origins, and treat bipedal <br>
primates kindly or merely as a light-element source, remains to be seen...<br>
