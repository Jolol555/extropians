On Mon, 23 Sep 1996 Euguene Leitl writes (and I discover to my dismay <br>
that I've broken radio silence on the extropian list):<br>

<i>&gt;Kathryn, my "less stringent" remark refers to this tolerance of grey </i><br>

 <br>
My dear Eugene, I do not equate tolerance of grey areas with mental <br>
laziness.  <br>
<p>
Bart Kosko expresses this in a way you could perhaps relate to:<br>
<p>
	"All facts were matters of degree.  The facts were always<br>
	fuzzy or vague or inexact to some degree. Only math was<br>
	black and white and it was just an artificial system of <br>
	rules and symbols.  Science treated the grey or fuzzy facts<br>
	as if they were the black/white facts of math.  Yet no one<br>
	had put forth a single fact about the world that was 100%<br>
	true or 100% false.  They just said they all were."<br>
