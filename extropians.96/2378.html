I see your argument, but it isn't based in information theory, rather <br>
(information-) ontology. <br>
<p>
The big problem in this debate is that we always confuse numerical <br>
identity with ontological identity and personal identity. They do not <br>
need to be equivalent. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were </i><br>

<i>&gt; Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move </i><br>

<p>
Actually, if I encode a message in something (say a disk or a hydrogen<br>
atom), I can move it around quite well without copying it. Information<br>
doesn't seem to be able to exist on its own, it needs to be encoded in<br>
something since it is a pattern. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt; best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.</i><br>
<p>
Even if we would accept your argument, it wouldn't make uploading <br>
impossible. It would just make some of us more reluctant to try it, while <br>
others wouldn't care. <br>
<p>
The big question I have, is information == consciousness? Or consciousness<br>
a property of information (processing)? Or something else?  Big question,<br>
hard to answer. <br>
