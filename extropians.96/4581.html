From: John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; By the way, I'm looking forward to reading  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hans Moravec's new book "MIND AGE", I think it's a scandal he's had so much  </i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble getting it published.</i><br>
<p>
I am looking forward to it, too, but I think I may know part of the<br>
problem.  Moravec has occasionally published excerpts from the book<br>
online, posting some to usenet and possibly even some here.  Although I<br>
enjoyed Mind Children very much, I found his writing in the new book to<br>
be almost impenetrable.  It was very dense and hard to follow.<br>
<p>
Granted these were just pieces of the book, and possibly when seen as<br>
part of a whole chain of development they would be easier to understand.<br>
But really I thought the writing style itself was getting in the way.<br>
It was almost as though he was having trouble clearly expressing ideas<br>
which he had developed in his own mind to an elaborate degree.  I wonder<br>
if anyone else has had the same reaction.<br>
<p>
