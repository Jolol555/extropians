<i>&gt;This happens with many such games, but it's a side effect.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;The games are designed to be entertaining; if your perception of time </i><br>
<i>&gt;changes, that's fine, but that wasn't the intention of the programmer.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But what if it were the intention of the programmer?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Suppose you had a game which was *designed* to change </i><br>
<i>&gt;the player's perception of time.  Or space.  Or...   </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any ideas about how this could be done?  </i><br>
<p>
How about a fast-paced game where the action gradually increased the more<br>
you played it so that the action never appeared to slow but your perception<br>
of time became faster and faster. Perhaps we could add transhuman<br>
principles into this game. Hmmm, I'm going to think about this one because<br>
designing 'creative interactive entertainment' aka computer/video games<br>
(hopefully VR, which is why I want to learn rendering) is what I'm<br>
intending on doing as a career.<br>
