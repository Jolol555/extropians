i asked:<br>
<i>&gt;&lt;Are you implying that a more biological/environmental approach to </i><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanism in general would be a path that ultimately leads to </i><br>
<i>&gt;stagnation ?&gt;</i><br>
<p>
mark wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;NO, not at all!</i><br>
<i>&gt;I definitely feel that "a more biological/environmental approach" MUST </i><br>
<i>&gt;be part of transhumanism in order to complement the mechanical and </i><br>
<i>&gt;directed-design approaches that are often emphasized.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As you say:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&lt;I can just as easily imagine a robot society just 'reproducing' </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;itself with the only goal of 'spreading' or replicating, than a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;combined biological/technological posthuman culture.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is exactly the point I wanted to bring out.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I just happened to recall Ryman's _Child Garden_ in the context of </i><br>
<i>&gt;human photosynthesis and, when I looked back through the book, thought </i><br>
<i>&gt;it was ironic that *even* a society based on the advanced organic </i><br>
<i>&gt;approaches described could end up somewhat stagnant.</i><br>
<p>
like Anders wrote: it's all about balancing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think you identify the reason why when you say:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;I don't think it has much to do with a technological path chosen, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;more with the cultural goals of such a society.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S. There was another hook in there which no one bit at.  I'm sort of </i><br>
<i>&gt;glad because then I'd have to take the time to struggle with that fish </i><br>
<i>&gt;(and it's a big one!)</i><br>
<p>
maybe you should have replied it to either the privacy discussion or the non<br>
human vs transhuman discussion as well, or are you refering to the fact that<br>
no one lived over 40 ? I'd be happy to bite into that hook, but i think i<br>
need a bigger worm! <br>
<p>
the way i see it there were many little hooks in there, if you'd like to be<br>
more specific ?<br>
