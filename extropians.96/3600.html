Well, actually that risks might exist. A small proportion of the populace <br>
immunoreact strongly to certain, innocuous to the rest of us, substances. <br>
In some cases this reaction might be even life-threatening. If you <br>
introduce novel genes, these are (usually) expressed into (potentially <br>
nasty) proteins.(If an enzyme is lacking, as e.g. in antimush-tomatoes, the <br>
probability of a immunoreaction is virtually nil). <br>
<p>
The possibility of this actually happening to you is infinitesimally <br>
small, of course. However, it is growing due to occurance of immunodeficiencies <br>
increasing dramatically, partly because of us dumping a staggering amount of <br>
novel, evolutionary unprecedented substances into the ecosphere. Lacking <br>
MYrs of Darwinian adaptation, considering the number of substances in <br>
widespread use (and their future introduction trend) and ability of signal <br>
biomolecule analoga to trigger noticeable effects in infinitesimally small <br>
concentrations I see a number of unavoidable problems in our immediate <br>
future.<br>
<p>
If an enzyme is lacking, as e.g. in antimush-tomatoes, the probability of <br>
a immunoreaction is virtually nil, of course.<br>

<i>&gt; engineering and I was unimpressed.  Seems more reactionary than anything.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but watch out for bioweapon research. But of _course_ nobody is <br>
doing biological weapon research nowadays...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I would think they would be in favor of it.  Fewer pesticides, more</i><br>
<p>
Actually, most crop modifications made by company Foo are made to make <br>
the crop resistant against total herbicide Bar, usually also produced by <br>
Foo. So you are forced to buy crop seeds and Bar from Foo, and one day <br>
you might wind up dumping ktons of Bar onto your fields, resulting in total <br>
herbicaust of non-crops, massive, and growing Bar and Bar residues <br>
contamination of your ground water, and, a very noticeable drain on your <br>
pocket. Additionally, you get a nice market oligopoly, with just Foo1, Foo2 <br>
and perhaps Foo3 as major players.<br>
<p>
Apart from killer bioapplications, these are the great benefits of <br>
recombinant DNA technology, if unleashed onto the wonderful free markets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; efficient usage of farmland, and a cleaner ecosystem all seem to me to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; Greenpeace type goals.</i><br>
<p>
While Greenpeace is nowadays doing PR mostly, and is barking upon a <br>
totally wrong tree, it is barking up a _tree_, at least.<br>
<p>
Recombinant DNA is like plutonium: you can use it to readically <br>
illuminate major cities, and you can use it for space probe ion drive <br>
propulsion.<br>
