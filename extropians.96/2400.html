Many people confuse READING a virus executable with EXECUTING a virus <br>
executable.  Every virus contains a trigger that *requires* the <br>
execution of the file.  Files don't normally execute by themselves.  <br>
In the case of email, it would require the recipient explicitly <br>
executing this file after it was saved to the hard drive.  The act of <br>
saving the file to the hard drive does not pose any immediate threat.  <br>
Only if the virus is activated does it become a problem.<br>
<p>
The exception:   <br>
<p>
Some applications contain macro languages that can cause damage if <br>
read from a file, instead of being executed.  Viruses designed this <br>
way usually have limited capability, and are not really viruses by <br>
definition.  Postscript documents are an example of read-only files <br>
that can contain destructive instructions to the application they run <br>
under.  There is also a somewhat famous one that runs under MS Word.<br>
<p>
Bottom line is don't execute an executable unless you know what it <br>
is.<br>
