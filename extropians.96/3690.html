From: Richard Brodie &lt;RBrodie@brodietech.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Wonderful! Do you see the error in your reasoning? Half the people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever lived are still alive. What are the chances that George Washington</i><br>
<i>&gt; is still alive? And how infinitesimal the probability that, out of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the eons of the existence of the universe, you and I lived now! But it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not unlikely, don't you see? The probability of anything having happened</i><br>
<i>&gt; after it has already happened is 100%. There are an infinity of equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely scenarios that didn't happen.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think you can usefully take the view that everything which has<br>
happened has simply happened, and we can draw no useful probability<br>
conclusions from the evidence we see.<br>
<p>
If I flip a coin 100 times and it comes up heads every time, I can't<br>
just say, oh, well, that's what happened and so the probability of that<br>
having happened is 100%.  Instead, I must entertain the possibility that<br>
I am dealing with a two headed coin.<br>
<p>
I say, if I had had a normal coin the chances of that series of coin<br>
flips would have been infinitesimal.  If I had had a two headed coin<br>
the chances would have been certain.  Now I factor in my a priori belief<br>
that I had a two headed coin (probably they are outnumbered by regular<br>
coins by a factor of a billion or so) and I conclude that there is a<br>
pretty good chance that I do in fact have a two headed coin.<br>
<p>
Similarly, if I see myself in circumstances which are highly improbable<br>
given that humanity will expand to engulf the galaxy, while they would<br>
be relatively probable if the human race is about to die out, then I<br>
must raise my estimate of the probability of the latter possibility.<br>
Saying that the probability of my existence is 100% because I exist does<br>
not provide any useful information, any more than doing that in the coin<br>
flipping example would have.<br>
<p>

P.S. Please let me know in private mail if you think I am posting too<br>
much on this topic.<br>
