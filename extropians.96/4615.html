&lt;&lt; Hey, I just thought of something! Maybe the<br>
 life I'm currently living is just a uploaded environment I've created and<br>
 have switched on my Programmed Ignorance switch to enjoy and experience it.<br>
 Perhaps when we die, we're just exiting the program. &gt;&gt;<br>

This sounds similar to a popular idea in mysticism.  That is: we are really<br>
immortal beings coming down to earth for the period of a life time to gain<br>
understanding of the universe.  <br>
The answer to both propositions is the same: with no possibility of assurance<br>
it matters not at all.<br>
