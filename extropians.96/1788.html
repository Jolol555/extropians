IAN: Robbery is a violation of property rights.  Pointing to the<br>
theft of property is not a logical way to argue for the abolition <br>
of property rights.<br>

<i> &gt; Yeah, there's the beef. But it doesn't take a lot of effort on the part </i><br>

<p>
IAN: Your free to work for only two hours a day right now. Many others<br>
want to work for more that two hours.  Hell, live and let work.<br>

<i> &gt; No, because in above system, supply meets need, rather than demand. </i><br>

<p>
IAN: Who decides how much I need? Me or you?  Under your system you decide <br>
what others need, so the idea that you support any anarco system is false.<br>
All collectivism that is not happy with the right people have now to go off<br>
and buy some cheap land and form a free collective is inherently statist.<br>

IAN: Can you show exactly where Keynes actually said this ?<br>
