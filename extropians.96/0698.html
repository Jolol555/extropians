<i>&gt;I think it will benefit of each of us to spread the Extropian memes to all </i><br>
<i>&gt;people on Earth.  Not necessarily to have everyone identify themselves as </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Extropian," but to have everyone working dilligently on increasing the amount </i><br>
<i>&gt;of intelligence, creativity, happiness, etc. in their lives; all of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian Values.  To infect someone with a meme, the meme must have qualities </i><br>
<i>&gt;which help it to flourish in the individual's current memetic system.  There </i><br>
<i>&gt;are no "one meme fits all" in memetic competition.  To really be effective at </i><br>
<i>&gt;spreading our memes, we need to gain a deep understanding of people's belief </i><br>
<i>&gt;systems, so that we can design memes that work WITH their belief systems, to </i><br>
<i>&gt;transform them into something more Extropian.  It would be helpful for many of </i><br>
<i>&gt;us to infiltrate various major world religions, gain an understanding of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;people's psychology, their belief systems and so forth.  Then it would be good </i><br>
<i>&gt;to write a few books, aimed at the people in the particular religion, written </i><br>
<i>&gt;as though they are by an "insider" of the religion, but with the Extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;Values seamlessly mixed in with the traditional religious memes.  One way to </i><br>
<i>&gt;do this is to highly emphasize the memes of the religion which are the most </i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian (such as, "God helps those who help themselves.") and ignore or </i><br>
<i>&gt;downplay those which aren't.  The books need to be very compelling to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;people in these religions so that they become widely read by the members of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the religion and deeply embedded.</i><br>
<p>
Even before you said it I WAS THINKING THE SAME EXACT THING! You hit it<br>
right on the money. The "extropian companion to christianity". I should<br>
myself write a book on this if I have time considering I was raised in a<br>
house where my mom taught a bible study/fellowship and is a church secretary<br>
and my whole family is heavily christian.<br>
But you cannot show christians blatantly obvious facts that slap down<br>
religion because they will then take the blind faith defense. I once used<br>
the tactic against my mother in that GOD couldn't have created the entire<br>
population from adam and eve because for about 2 generations after them<br>
there would be major genetic defects from brother-sister and cousin<br>
relationships leading to something nowhere near human due to the gene pool<br>
being so small. But my mother replied that I had to take it on faith that<br>
GOD prevented those birth defects. HOW BLATANTLY STUPID! So I replied, "What<br>
happens if you blind fold yourself and run through a forest? You'd slam into<br>
a tree! now thats blind faith for you!". Or heres another example try<br>
guessing on a math problem, guess what? I bet you'll likely get a wrong<br>
answer. Blind faith is an obvious sign of a memetic infection.<br>
