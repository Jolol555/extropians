<p>
Why do you think it would be idiotic to talk to SI's?  If we are all SI's, <br>
would what we have said be any less meaningful to you?   If you like what we <br>
say, then does it matter whether we are SI's or not?   If talking to us helps <br>
you accomplish your goals, then it doesn't really matter whether we are SI's <br>
or not, and there is no reason to feel idiotic about talking to a group of <br>
SI's.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Also, you give the implication that talking to oneself is something that only <br>
idiots do.  From my own personal experience, the more I talk to myself, the <br>
faster I learn, and the smarter I become.  Most of us talk to ourselves <br>
subvocally; we don't actually make the sounds, but we imagine what is being <br>
said.  Talking to oneself can help one develop a greater ability to express <br>
one's mind through words and thus be a more effective communicator.  Words are <br>
tools, and the more we play around with them and use them, the more skilled we <br>
can become in using them.  Talking to oneself is one form of thinking, and it <br>
is nothing to be embarrased of.<br>
