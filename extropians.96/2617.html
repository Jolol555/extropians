        These questions have come up multiple times on the list; I thought I<br>
had answered them, but obviously not well enough.  Michael Lorrey did a good<br>
job of explaning, but I'll still try to point out *my* thoughts.  Here goes<br>
(in the shortest, most precise words I can find):<br>
<p>
        Yes, it is possible for *your* consciousness to exist in two places<br>
at one time.  Each independent consciousness that acknowledges itself as<br>
*yours* will carry on as if it is *you*.  However, each consciousness that<br>
acknowledges itself as *yours* will have different experiences, ultimately<br>
leading to a renewed stream of consciousness.  As Michael said, it is<br>
potentially a 'budding' system where all consciousnesses are created as<br>
identical replicas of *you* but stray away to become different *yous* based<br>
on their individual experiences.  Okay, so the words weren't so short or<br>
precise...but it's the *thought* that counts --pun intended! :-)<br>
