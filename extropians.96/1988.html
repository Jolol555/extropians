For information about the current state of the art in Turing Test<br>
passing programs, see the Loebner Prize home page, at &lt;URL:<br>
<a href="http://acm.org/~loebner/loebner-prize.htmlx">http://acm.org/~loebner/loebner-prize.htmlx</a> &gt;.  There you will find<br>
links to recent winners, including the 1996 winner, a program from<br>
Australia.  There are actually two programs there, one called HeX and<br>
the other called (I am somewhat embarrassed to say) HAL.<br>
<p>
These programs are all smoke and mirrors, using conversational<br>
trickery to try to distract and misdirect the judge for long enough<br>
that he doesn't notice the utter lack of understanding which the<br>
program really possesses.  It's kind of like watching David Letterman<br>
fly.  You might not be able to distinguish him from someone really<br>
flying given the constraints of limited time and viewing angles, but<br>
that doesn't mean there's no difference.<br>
<p>
When you look at the larger body of transcripts you begin to see the<br>
repetitions, the errors, the flashy but canned statements, and you<br>
realize how little is actually there.<br>
<p>
The author readily admits this, and on his web page you can find his<br>
article called "How to Pass the Turing Test by Cheating."<br>
<p>
Lyle's game is amusing but as in many such cases the facts are ultimately<br>
more interesting.  The real question is whether the Turing test is valid,<br>
and in particular just how much interaction is necessary before we can<br>
know that the program is showing real understanding.<br>
