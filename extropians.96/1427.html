This is getting a little too personal for my liking, but I must say I found<br>
this particular post far more pleasant than the last one: thanks, Reilly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sarah Marrs wrote 9/28/96: &lt;Congratulations. I think you've won a prize for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;most unpleasant and ad feminam comment I've ever read on this or the &gt;H list.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I couldn't find "ad feminam" in my dictionary.  Is it a Latin derivative?</i><br>
<p>
Yep. A mere feminist conceit on my part. Shouldn't worry about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You</i><br>
<i>&gt;called yourself a "gal," am I supposed to not pick on you?  You want a</i><br>
break?  &gt;I don't take gender claims seriously on the Net.  Maybe if I meet<br>
you, I'll be<br>
<i>&gt;more chivalrous.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I call myself lots of things, and none of them are intended to make<br>
people stop picking on me (in fact, I suspect some of them encourage it). I<br>
do think this is an inappropriate forum for claims against the person,<br>
rather than against the views or arguments of that person, but if you wanna<br>
go for it, go for it!<br>
<p>
(Not a great fan of chivalry myself, although I have been known to hold<br>
doors open for attractive women, I suppose.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;My experience of this list is that people always speak out if the disagree</i><br>
<i>&gt;with something, but don't if they simply agree. So I would have interpreted a</i><br>
<i>&gt;lack of responses to my original mail as agreement by the list, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagreement (and hence disagreement with you).&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thank you for sharing your experience.  What a convenient and</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-congratulatory interpretation.</i><br>
<p>
I can see how it my come across as such. Oops, my mistake.<br>
<p>
However, in the light of Robin Hanson's corroborative post I must say it<br>
seems I was wrong. In some ways I think that's a shame: if people disagree<br>
with me I'd like to know. For instance, Robin and I had a short discussion<br>
some time ago which showed me flaws in my thinking and allowed me to revise<br>
my ideas on gender very productively. I'd hate to think I might have missed<br>
that chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I see that with a worldview of relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth and mythological history...</i><br>
<p>
Your formation of this opinion started from the premise that I thought<br>
contradictory things could happen in the same place at the same time. I don't.<br>
So that ain't my worldview. Promise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;Where did I, or you, mention contradicatory events? Where did I, or you,</i><br>
<i>&gt;mention the same place? What, in short, are you talking about?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You invoked quantum physics at the Planck scales in the context of events</i><br>
<i>&gt;occurring in space-time.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I did. And?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;I just tried to explain what toleration actually is: no judgement call.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nonsense, we judge all the time, some of us are more honest about it.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt;tolerate someone's intentions or actions means we've judged them to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;unimportant.  Beneath us.</i><br>
<p>
Similar thing to last time: you're confusing a judgement call _about_<br>
toleration with a judgement call which _is_ toleration.<br>
<p>
I disagree that toleration means judging a person's actions to be<br>
unimportant. For instance, suppose I had a partner who spent a lot of time<br>
away, which made me unhappy, but she was away because she was helping with<br>
human rights issues somewhere. I might tolerate her absence precisely<br>
_because_ I considered her actions so incredibly important, and _above_ me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;I base the answers to these questions on feelings, so you wouldn't accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;them anyway.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't "feel" that I would accept them, no.  Now if you wanted to find some</i><br>
<i>&gt;ground underneath the feelings, something connected to rational thought, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be interested.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't hold your breath in this case :-) I'm not about to try and<br>
rationalize my system of morality and ethics at this point, which is what<br>
such a discussion would amount to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;You're confusing the feelings which _are_ tolerance and intolerance with</i><br>
<i>&gt;feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Feelings are confusing.  That's why I prefer thinking, clarity and</i><br>
certainty &gt;are more adaptive than mush.<br>
<p>
I prefer to use both systems as appropriate. Doesn't alter the fact, you<br>
were confusing the feelings which _are_ tolerance and intolerance with<br>
feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;An individual's feelings include tolerance and intolerance...&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tolerance is not a "feeling," but a virtue.</i><br>
<p>
That's a very healthy attitude.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;Personally, however, I don't attach such value judgements to tolerance or</i><br>
<i>&gt;intolerance: i.e. I would not make a blanket statement that tolerance is</i><br>
<i>&gt;good. I choose to tolerate some things, and not tolerate others.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you throw dice to choose?  Spin arrows?  Consult the Ouija board?  Call the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Psychic Hot-Line?</i><br>
<p>
How did you guess? :-)<br>
<p>
Again, all I'm saying is that I don't place a value judgement on tolerance<br>
itself. I would not say 'tolerance' is good, and therefore tolerate all<br>
things. My value judgements decide what I tolerate and what I do not tolerate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;But my balance would place diversity above being destroyed, so I</i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't be in that situation.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You would rather be destroyed than dishonor diversity?  What a funny "feeling."</i><br>
<p>
No: I think my reply was badly worded. I'd rather not be destroyed _and_<br>
honour diversity. Mind you, sometimes that's a difficult fight!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;So it is those listening who change human ideals, not those talking.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Passivity is passivity, not change.</i><br>
<p>
But the actions precipitated in those who listen by those who talk are the<br>
real agents of societal change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SM: &lt;So what was the theory that Brown had when he observed Brownian motion for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first time?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How did Brown recognize what he was observing without theoretically</i><br>
<i>&gt;categorizing it?</i><br>
<p>
Robert Brown observed Brownian motion and couldn't explain it: but I'm sure<br>
he had his own pet theory. It took Einstein to come up with the answer (if<br>
my science books are correct, and I have no reason to doubt them).<br>
<p>
But your argument was that "Observation, meaning no predictions are<br>
involved, still must have some theory behind it, or else what is to be<br>
recorded as having been observed?" When Brown first observed pollen motion<br>
there was no theory at all behind it. Afterwards there may have been some<br>
incorrect theory behind it. But supposing Brown had just recorded his<br>
observations, without any supporting theory (which, for all I know, he may<br>
have done). That wouldn't have stopped Einstein coming up with the theory<br>
and, after verification, explanation for the phenomenon. You don't need a<br>
theory to observe, and you don't need a theory to record your observations.<br>
