<i>&gt;&gt; I agree with that. The others are just tag-along freeloaders! Yeah right,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; like they should have the honor of sharing our credit. We earned it while</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; most countries sat on their asses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;...starving.</i><br>
<p>
Oh come on! Please don't tell me that you are one of those people who would<br>
rather stay down here and help people before going out into space cause<br>
I've got news for you buddy! Going out into space will allow the creation<br>
of technologies to support more people and generate more food and solutions<br>
to population problems. We earned our status, lets not give it away like a<br>
bunch of socialists! We Are Libertarians! (Sorry, I just couldn't help it)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Chris, what do you mean, "*We* earned it."??!  You didn't do a damn thing to </i><br>
<i>&gt;help anyone get on the moon;  You weren't even born yet.  I think we can </i><br>
<i>&gt;safely put you in the tag-along freeloader category, for trying to take</i><br>
credit <br>
<i>&gt;for what certain people did, who happened to live on the region of land you </i><br>
<i>&gt;call your country.  What you just did in your comment is no different from</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;other countries taking credit for getting to the moon since people from</i><br>
their <br>
<i>&gt;planet got there, even though they weren't personally involved.</i><br>
<p>
Uhh, you're right but I'm feeling a bit patriotic at the moment. Besides, I<br>
should credit the entire generation of people who helped hype up the space<br>
race to allow the landing. Without hype, nothing usually ever gets<br>
accomplished. You NEED media hype to stir up action and motivate people. In<br>
blatant anarchy people always rise to power to lead the masses. There must<br>
always be a king of the mountain aka leader in the area of fresh new ideas<br>
not necessarily having power but often does acquire it.<br>

 to lose sight of the shore"<br>
