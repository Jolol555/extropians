              TERRORIZES  TOBACCO  WORKER<br>
<p>
By Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
The Associated Press ( The Washington Times, A10, 8/23/96 ) <br>
reports that Mark Deane, an employee of the Philip Morris tobacco <br>
company, has filed a $6 million lawsuit over threats made against <br>
his person by Food and Drug Administration investigators.<br>
<p>
After FDA investigators failed to arrive to a scheduled meeting <br>
on April 12, Mr. Deane left his home on an errand. His vehicle <br>
was then forced to stop by the car of the FDA investigators <br>
named in his suit: Gary Dean Light and an unnamed "John Doe."<br>
<p>
The AP article states that the "two men jumped out of the car, and <br>
Mr. Light shoved a blue-and-white badge into Mr. Deane's face and <br>
said he and Mr. Doe were special agents of he Justice Department <br>
working 'under the special jurisdiction of the grand jury.'"<br>
<p>
At that point Mr. Deane refused to speak without his attorney <br>
present. The suit states that Mr. light then stated in a <br>
threatening tone " We'll be seeing you."<br>
<p>
Then on April 17 the same two agents once again forced Mr. <br>
Deane's car to a stop. The suit states that this time they told <br>
Mr. Deane that if he did not cooperate with the investigator's <br>
demands he was " EXPENDABLE " and that they could "lock him <br>
up for 72 hours without anyone knowing anything about it." <br>
<p>
If true, no witness that the FDA brings in to a courtroom to speak <br>
before a jury can be believed because of the possibility that their <br>
testimony has been tainted by the threat of death. These threats <br>
appear to have been an attempt to coerce an individual to make <br>
legal statements he would not otherwise make.<br>
<p>
<p>
----  TERROR OVER TRUTH  ----<br>
<p>
Increasingly, terror is the tool of choice in governmental operations.<br>
This case of FDA intimidation is like the case of the intimidation <br>
by the FBI of Vince Foster death scene witness Patrick Knowlton just <br>
before he was to testify before the grand jury and after he refused <br>
to change his story as to what he saw at the Fort Marcy Park. Mr. <br>
Knowlton and his attorney John H. Clarke have compiled a report<br>
of witness tampering and intimidation -- an excerpt is at:<br>

                <br>
It appears that the govt has become so despotic that it is willing <br>
to resort to physical intimidation and death threats in order to change <br>
facts and create a false reality -- a truth by terror. The goal seems<br>
to be producing desired outcomes in legal investigations that will <br>
protect or expand to power of the federal government.<br>
<p>
In fact, stemming from the FDA's long battle to gain legal control <br>
over tobacco, President Clinton just singed an executive order -- <br>
a law by decree -- that grants the FDA sweeping new powers to <br>
crack down on tobacco. <br>
<p>
While these new FDA powers are supposedly an effort to keep tobacco <br>
away from children, the new legal definition of tobacco reportedly <br>
gives the FDA the legal right to prohibit tobacco altogether. <br>
<p>
If intimidation and terror reign over truth and justice, tyranny <br>
is sure to extinguish the light that is liberty, leaving the <br>
people at the mercy of malevolent masters.<br>
