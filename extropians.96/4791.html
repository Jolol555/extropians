<i>&gt; My guess is that beside the obvious uses for high-performance computing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; molecular modelling (there are many obvious nanotech applications for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this, and it might provide a strong impetus to develop nanotech just to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to build good quantum computers) and code cracking, I think the truly</i><br>
<i>&gt; awesome application might be AI. I haven't got the faintest idea of how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; implement AI in a quantum computer, but I think it could be tremendously</i><br>
<i>&gt; more efficient than on a conventional computer.  Hmm, I wonder what</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens if we move to quantum neural networks... </i><br>
<p>
Think genetic programming.  Current "populations" are in the 10^3-10^6<br>
range.  With a 64-qubit QC, you could have a population of sixteen<br>
billion billion.  Heck, with a 64-qubit QC, you could probably string<br>
instructions together completely at random and wind up with the most<br>
powerful solution immediately.  Who needs evolutionary computation?  As<br>
for quantum neural networks, it seems to me that the number of neurons<br>
simulated would simply equal 2^qubits or the amount of memory available<br>
- practically speaking, the amount of memory available.<br>
<p>
The real excitement comes when you consider the speed involved.  The<br>
human brain is composed of 10^11 neurons with 10^3 synapses each<br>
(approx.)  Assume one KB per synapse - you need 10^17 bytes of memory,<br>
or a hundred thousand terabytes.  The real kicker is that simulating a<br>
single pulse of a real synapse probably won't take more than a thousand<br>
operations.  Real neurons do maybe a thousand pulses per second - but a<br>
1-tHz computer could do a BILLION pulses a second, if it only had to<br>
simulate one synapse.  With a QC, each synapse is simulated in a<br>
different "branch", so a QC simulating a neural network, if it works at<br>
*all*, will work at a million times human speed.  Subjectively, that's 1<br>
year every 30 seconds.<br>
