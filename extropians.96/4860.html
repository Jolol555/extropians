<i>&gt; &gt; look at the amount of heat generated over abortions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Little light though.</i><br>
<p>
The point is that the abortion debate is as altruistic as it gets.  Few<br>
voters have anything to fear from abortions...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sure, people have better bodies and brains than flat worms.  Still, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them are MUCH better or worse than others in many [groups of] tasks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; from running to painting to math, based on both genetic factors and</i><br>
<i>&gt; upbringing.  This is a FACT of life.</i><br>
<p>
Heh.  And, as a countersphexist Algernon, I'm much better at causal<br>
analysis - including ethical blame-allocation - with a qualitative<br>
superiority totally beyond the mere individual variations to which you<br>
refer.  Clearly I have the right to direct your entire lifestyle.  No? <br>
Do you deny my superiority, or my right?  If my right, why shouldn't the<br>
"stupid masses" lead their own lives?  If my superiority, don't you<br>
think that my elaborate neurocognitive explanation of superior reasoning<br>
should carry more force than your looking down your nose at people who<br>
happened to wind up with a bad education?<br>
<p>
I don't necessarily believe that I'm a superior life-form, but I do want<br>
you to see it from the other side.  How do you like being part of the<br>
"stupid masses"?<br>
