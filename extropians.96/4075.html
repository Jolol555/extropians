<i>&gt; What I ask of you hyper-productive transhumans out there is for some </i><br>
<i>&gt; insight as to how other people maximize their activity/time density.  </i><br>
<p>
Several years ago, I ordered an audio-tape based course on time management.<br>
I followed some of the recommendations for a few years then, as I had a<br>
very stressful job as a project manager and I needed to say organized.<br>
Unfortunately, I left the tapes in my trunk at one point and they melted,<br>
so I don't have them any more.<br>
<p>
The author recommended using a Day-Timer, one of the brands of personal<br>
scheduling notebooks.  In this you would write down your goals for<br>
each day, as well as taking notes on things you do during the day.<br>
In addition, he suggested arranging your goals into categories, ranking<br>
them separately in terms of importance and urgency.  Some goals are<br>
important but relatively less urgent, like self-education, so we tend<br>
to let them drift.  Others are urgent but less important, like getting<br>
those reports xeroxed for the boss.  The system was designed so that<br>
you would not forget about the longer range goals and devote at least<br>
some time and effort to them every week if not every day.<br>
<p>
I wish I had not lost the tapes as I did find them beneficial, although<br>
after a few years I tended to drop my new good habits and fall back into<br>
my old relatively disorganized ways.  However the system really did work<br>
well for me and I was able to get a lot done during it.<br>
<p>
Maybe other people can recommend specific books or other resources on<br>
time management.<br>
