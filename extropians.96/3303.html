<i>&gt; You can also twist information for any use such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious or pollitical to make it sound like you're agreeing with their</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideals such as telling bleeding heart liberals that nano will be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; utility to accomplish their goal of world peace and unlimited wealth. (Even</i><br>
<i>&gt; though there will still be capitalism, we just won't meantion that!)</i><br>
<p>
Let's not, shall we?  It is true that nanotech - or my own vehicle, the<br>
Singularity - would be able to completely fulfill almost any ethical<br>
wish imaginable. BUT. If we go around preaching nano-paradise, we will<br>
be rightly regarded as loons.<br>
<p>
In the words of Drexler:<br>
<p>
      "I would emphasize that I have been invited to give talks<br>
      at places like the physical sciences colloquium series at<br>
      IBM's main research center, at Xerox PARC, and so forth,<br>
      so these ideas are being taken seriously by serious<br>
      technical people, but it is a mixed reaction. You want that<br>
      reaction to be as positive as possible, so I plead with<br>
      everyone to PLEASE KEEP THE LEVEL OF CULTISHNESS AND<br>
      BULLSHIT DOWN, and even to be rather restrained in<br>
      talking about wild consequences, which are in fact true<br>
      and technically defensible, because they don't sound that<br>
      way. People need to have their thinking grow into<br>
      longer-term consequences gradually; you don't begin<br>
      there." [Emphasis mine.]<br>
<p>
And my own reply:<br>
<p>
The problem with people expounding their Utopian visions of a nanotech<br>
world is that their consequences *aren't wild enough*. Looking at<br>
stories<br>
of instantly healing wounds, or any material object being instantly<br>
available, doesn't give you the sense of looking into the future. It<br>
gives<br>
you the sense that you're looking into an unimaginative person's<br>
childhood fantasy of omnipotence, and that predisposes you to treat<br>
nanotechnology in the same way. Worse, it attracts other people with<br>
unimaginative fantasies of omnipotence. There's no better way to turn<br>
into a bunch of parlor pinks, sipping coffee and planning the Revolution<br>
without actually doing anything.<br>
