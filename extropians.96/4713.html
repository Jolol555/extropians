<i>&gt; I belive that our individual thought processes are part of a </i><br>
<i>&gt; much larger thought process that is a result of the way </i><br>
<i>&gt; individual brains link up with each other.  Because we communicate </i><br>
<i>&gt; so intensely and assimilate each other's ideas so freely, </i><br>
<i>&gt; we are participating in the processes of a larger mind, </i><br>
<i>&gt; which acts as coherently and intelligently as any individual mind </i><br>
<i>&gt; composing it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Having multiple personalities makes it easier for me to see the </i><br>
<i>&gt; parallels between an individual mind and the mind of the collective, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Humanity.  But am I simply projecting my condition on Humanity </i><br>
<i>&gt; as a whole?  </i><br>
<p>
One of the basic themes of Plato's Republic is that the human mind is  <br>
a reflection of society; you can't understand one without understanding <br>
the other.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see the thousands of personalities in my own mind interacting </i><br>
<i>&gt; to form a coherent, intelligent entity, and I think that all humans </i><br>
<i>&gt; interact to form a similar type of coherent, intelligent entity.  </i><br>
<p>
But not with the same degree of coherence.  Your mind, fragmented <br>
though it is, is much more coherent than humanity as a whole.  <br>
If a larger mind is to be as coherent as an individual mind, it has to be <br>
smaller than humanity-as-a-whole, and it has to have a structure.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In my thinking, my thoughts provoke storms of association, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and they follow the same sort of winding path that people do </i><br>
<i>&gt; when they communicate with each other.  </i><br>
<p>
I wrote a post about this a couple of weeks ago --"intelligence increase <br>
(retracing associations)".  However, my thoughts don't usually provoke <br>
"storms" of association.  I go in and out of "storm" mode.  Most of the <br>
time I am in "path" mode.  There is a difference.  But then, I don't have <br>
thousands of distinct personalities, so it may be hard to compare our <br>
experiences.  <br>
<p>
The structure of your mind is not given.  It depends on your ontology.  <br>
The storms or chains of association that exist in our consciousness are <br>
just the raw material from which we construct our minds.  Theologies <br>
create minds.  <br>
<p>
Merry Christmas,  <br>
