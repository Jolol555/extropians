I wonder how soon small CCD cameras like the Connectix QuickCam )<br>
(see <a href="http://www.connectix.com/connect/fishcam.html">http://www.connectix.com/connect/fishcam.html</a>) will begin <br>
showing up sprinkled around cities for security, traffic monitoring, <br>
etc?  <br>
<p>
For anyone out there that is interested in pursuing this sort of <br>
application as a business, Quadrant International has just released a <br>
board called VideoWave (see <a href="http://www.quadrant.com/news/news.html">http://www.quadrant.com/news/news.html</a>) <br>
which is a Wavelet-based S-Video capture/playback for under $500.<br>
<p>
For those Extropians who are multimedia junkies, this is truly a <br>
quantum-leap in affordable HQ nonlinear video.<br>
<p>
It would seem that the days of the time-lapse VCR in banks, <br>
department stores, Seven-11's and liquor stores are numbered, now, as <br>
 the pc-based solution is finally cheaper.<br>
<p>
What I'd like to see is some sort of similarly integrated and <br>
mass-produced intelligent digital telemetry kit.  Sort of like a <br>
"generic" wireless data extension cord for the multimedia appliance.<br>
<p>
For example, something that is directional, and source independent.  <br>
Whatever digital source gets plugged-in to the transmitter, gets <br>
relayed and reproduced at the side of the receiver.<br>
<p>
Does anybody know if such a general telemetry device exists, or has <br>
been proposed?<br>
<p>
