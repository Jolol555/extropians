<i>&gt; </i><br>
Cars, Trains, and radio are not intelligence-augmemnting technologies<br>
in the same sense that computers are likely to be. This is the crux<br>
of my argument.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;If uploads are similar to other types of algorithms,</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;lot of time on cummunication of intermediate results.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sometines a few fast processors are best, sometimes lots of little</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones are best.  That's the way it is now, and should remain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
To the extent that I have any area of expertise, it's in the area of<br>
distributed processing, computer communicatins, and multiprocessor<br>
architectures. There is a very large body of research in this area.<br>
Your statement is correct in the abstract, but in practice you start<br>
with the fastest reasonable processor you can get. You don't use<br>
multiple processor unless a single processor is very expensive.<br>
For simple communications-intensive problems such as communications<br>
switching, the power of a multiprocessing system goes up with the<br>
log of the number of processors: for equal processors, a four-processor<br>
system is twice as fast as a single-processor system. Different<br>
problems have different characteristics, and the interconnection<br>
topology can be optimized for the problem, but the algorithms get<br>
complicated very quickly.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;I feel that "knowledge-filled" will be superceeded by the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;access the entire knowledge base at a very high data rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You lost me here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That was a bit cryptic, wasn't it? Your post mentioned knowledge and<br>
processing power as contributors to intelligence. I assumed from context<br>
that you were modelling an intelligent entity as containing a processor<br>
and<br>
a data store, along with other stuff. My point is that the data store<br>
can be distributed and shared via communications. If it is, the complete<br>
body of knowledge contributes to each intelligent entity. I propose<br>
that the size of this database is not the only factor in intelligence:<br>
the speed at which it can be accessed is also important.<br>
   Consider: the WWW currently contains about 2 terabytes of accessible<br>
information: so does a reasonable University library. However, I can<br>
access the whole web rapidly. Thus the web amplifies my intelligence<br>
more than all of the world's university libraries do.<br>
