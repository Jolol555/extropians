I'vd been reading a book, "The Conscious Mind" by David Chalmers,<br>
Oxfore University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-19-510553-2.<br>
<p>
Chalmers takes the notion that qualia, or our direct experience of<br>
phenomena as a indication that consciousness is irreducible and not<br>
explainable as part of other systems, such as materialism. About the<br>
first half of the book is devoted to arguments concerning this. (I had<br>
a hard time with this, for I basically disagree, in that I feel that<br>
memory is essential to the experience of consciousness.)<br>
<p>
Then we get to the interesting stuff. Chalmers suggests that the qualia<br>
in<br>
functionally isomorphic systems are identical. A model of my brain will<br>
have<br>
and be conscious in the same way that I am.<br>
<p>
He demolishes Penrose's contention regarding our ability to comprehend<br>
Godel sentences quite concisely:<br>
<p>
	The short answer to these arguments is that there is no reason<br>
	to believe that humans can see the truth of the relevant Godel<br>
	sentences, either. At best, we can see that if a system is<br>
	consistent, then its Godel sentence is true, but there is no<br>
	reason to believe that we can determine the consistence of <br>
	arbitrary formal systems. This holds particularly in the case<br>
	of complex formal systems, such as a system that simulates<br>
	the output of a human brain: the task of determining whether<br>
	such a system is consistent might well be beyond us. So it may <br>
	well be that each of us can be simulated by a complex formal<br>
	system F, such that we cannot determine whether F is consistent.<br>
	If so, we will not be able to see the truth of our own Godel<br>
	sentences. (Page 330)<br>
<p>
His discussion of quantum mechanics is also interesting, in particular<br>
his<br>
view toward Emmet's ideas which are often misstated as the "many worlds"<br>
interpretation of QM. <br>
