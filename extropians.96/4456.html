In reply to my statement, <br>
<p>
: In a sea of pseudorandom bits generated by a simple encryption <br>
: program, a "seriously" encrypted message would stand out.  Then <br>
: they would know:  here is somebody who has something to hide.  <br>
: The standard encryption isn't good enough for this guy -- so who is he?  <br>
: And then they would proceed to find out who he is.  <br>

<i>&gt; These arguments are not valid. Cryptography does not work this way.</i><br>
<p>
What I'm trying to say is that when they recognize that someone is <br>
using strong cryptography -- stronger than what most people <br>
generally use -- they will use *other* methods to investigate and <br>
find out what he's up to.  Cryptography can be supplemented by <br>
plain old detective work.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is quite impossible to tell random from pseudorandom, </i><br>
<p>
Why is it impossible?  If that's a theorem, I would like to see the proof.    <br>
Anyway the problem here is not to distinguish random from <br>
pseudorandom.  The problem is to distinguish among the many <br>
different kinds of pseudorandomness.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only way to tell them apart would try a serious cryptoattack, </i><br>
<i>&gt; which is a very costly business.  </i><br>
<p>
So it's costly.  When the government feels seriously threatened,   <br>
they will spend astonomical amounts of money to defend themselves.  <br>
Cryptography is now classified as munitions, and the NSA may emerge <br>
as a branch of the military, with the same standing as the Army, Navy, <br>
and Air Force, and with a comparable budget.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;: but the NSA could see the difference.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But not _casually_. That's the point.  </i><br>
<p>
Why is that the point?  There is nothing casual about this.  Recognizing <br>
the various kinds of pseudorandom sequences produced by various <br>
encryption schemes is not easy; neither is finding submarines in the <br>
ocean.  But neither problem is impossible.  Suppose NSA has a budget <br>
as big as the Navy's budget.  Then a lot of things become possible.  <br>
<p>
It is true that universal encryption would make the NSA's task more <br>
difficult.  Instead of using chips that make a simple distinction between <br>
low-entropy and high-entropy messages, they would have to <br>
continually upgrade their chips to make more and more fine-grained <br>
distinctions, and they would have to use other methods as well.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;: Let me rephrase my original statement:  using more encryption than </i><br>
<i>&gt;: other people commonly use is like painting your windows black when </i><br>
<i>&gt;: everybody else uses curtains.  It just attracts attention.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody using cryptography equals to anybody having windows. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is just some of them are bulletproof.  Really easy to tell, huh?  </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is easy to tell.  <br>
1.  Shoot a bullet at the window.  If it breaks, it's not bulletproof.  <br>
2.  Take pictures of all houses in the neighborhood with an <br>
      infra-red camera.  Regular glass and bulletproof glass will show up <br>
      differently in the pictures.  <br>
3.  Reflect a laser off all the windows in the neighborhood.  Different <br>
      kinds of glass have different properties, and are identifiable.  <br>
4.  Ask the contractors who build houses -- who uses bulletproof glass?  <br>
5.  Ask the company that makes bulletproof glass -- who buys it?  <br>
<p>
Anyway this analogy is not valid.  Everybody using cryptography <br>
equals to everybody *covering* their windows.  It's just that some use <br>
more opaque coverings than others.  If there is a standard covering <br>
that most people use, and somebody uses a different, more opaque <br>
covering, that person has called attention to himself.  <br>
