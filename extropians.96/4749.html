<p>
<i>&gt;This is a good idea and would probably require a "3 gender structure". </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was really thinking that the probes wouldn't gather that much </i><br>

<p>
The *knowledge* i was thinking of would also include improvements to the<br>
probes themselves, so they could deal more efficiently with problems they<br>
ran across...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, I was thinking that the probes wouldn't be very creative and </i><br>

<i>&gt;updates to the probes and whether this would even be desirable.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As you say:</i><br>

<i>&gt;can make new probes that include technology based on that new </i><br>
<i>&gt;knowlegde.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Whether this would even be desirable ? <br>
<p>
How do you estimate the chances for long term expansion and preservation of<br>
any species with a static society/technology ? I think this exchange of<br>
knowledge should be especially important in the case of a threathening<br>
catastrope. <br>

Yes, this is why i suggested the 3 gender system, the probe would drop the<br>
seeds of the 'species', but also 3rd type units, that immediately begin<br>
reproducing the probes, new technology based on the previous probes<br>
experiences added. The seeds for the species would just need to be dropped<br>
to increase the slim chances that the catastrophe might 'miss a spot', or<br>
that one of the colonies might develop the technology to escape or stop the<br>
catastrophe....<br>

<p>
In our original *brainstorming*, there was the time limit element, generated<br>
by a catastrophe following behind the probes.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
The same occurs in replying to postings. You find a posting that vaguely<br>
interests you, and then go back and read the earlier postings in the thread<br>
to create a sound and solid reply. ;-P <br>
