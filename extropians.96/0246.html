If you haven't read Linda Nagata's "The Bohr Maker" (Bantam Spectra, Apr'95, <br>
ISBN 0-553-56925-2), it's well worth reading even if you normally have <br>
little time for fiction. Her story (with well-developed characters &amp; drama <br>
for a first-time novel) involves a near-future solar system based on <br>
nanotechnology, 'attrium' implants for full immersion into VR and the <br>
transmission of mind copies between distributed attriums. Plus, there's a <br>
libertarian struggle against a 'Gaian' World government that exists for the <br>
primary purpose of avoiding a 'gray-goo booboo' AND proscribing transhuman <br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
If this story is old news, forgive my enthusiasm. The reason I make this <br>
posting is that I find Nagata's 'attrium' ideas to be intriguingly original <br>
and wonder if anything similar is published or posted on the Net somewhere. <br>
Here are some notes I recently took on 'Attriums' after rereading "The Bohr <br>
Maker":<br>
<p>
07/04/96. ATTRIUMS &amp; GHOSTS ENVISIONED. Linda Nagata's 1995 novel "The Bohr <br>
Maker" describes an artificial organ called an 'attrium' grown by nanotech <br>
'makers' in human brains to provide direct immersion in virtual realities, <br>
communications on the Net and remote sensing by linking to similarly <br>
augmented people, animals and mechanical sensors at distant locations.<br>
<p>
While it may be feasible that such a device itself could eventually be built <br>
and implanted, a few practical interim questions are (a) how would an <br>
'attrium' interact with the organic human brain and nervous system; and, (b) <br>
how could the necessary wide-bandwidth and far-ranging communications be <br>
implemented, especially given the current worries about the effects on <br>
organic functions of ELF and more high-powered electromagnetic energies? <br>
(When even cellular phones are suspected of having some impact on brain <br>
tumors in certain genetically susceptible individuals, it seems unlikely <br>
that a radio transponder could be implanted in human brains without serious <br>
biological side effects.)<br>
<p>
As a communication alternative, there is some speculation in the quantum <br>
physics community over the potential for non-local communication, i.e., once <br>
they have interacted, two quantum particles remain immediately correlated <br>
regardless of their distance from each other. Some progress in quantum <br>
computing based on these principles has been made. What about prospects for <br>
remote sensing and communications without the need for electromagnetic <br>
transmissions? At best, such a method of communication would be a one-shot <br>
deal because once the initial report from the remote sensor had been <br>
observed at the originating location, the quantum isolation that supported <br>
the non-local correlation would have been broken. Even if a large amount of <br>
information, from an extended period of observation, could be 'transmitted' <br>
before it is observed at the 'receiver', this would imply that such links <br>
could not be in real time - the receiver would have to wait for the end of <br>
the 'transmission' before observing it. Such a link would be completely <br>
passive and wouldn't allow two-way communication.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is for these reasons that Linda Nagata envisioned fully-immersive <br>
communication between attriums taking place only via the downloading of <br>
'ghosts', extracts of a person's sensibilities, memories &amp; mind, able to <br>
transmit to another's attrium, reside there 'off line' from the originator's <br>
mind, and able to return the experiences to the originator only by <br>
disengaging and uploading back to the 'home address'.<br>
<p>
07/20/96. ATTRIUM DESIGN LEVELS. While Nagata doesn't go into any of the <br>
following, I think there would likely be several stages in the development <br>
of such attriums:<br>
<p>
A level 1 Attrium would basically be a thought &amp; experience recorder: able <br>
to replay sensations and subvocalized thoughts; which also implies a <br>
capability to generate something like a 'hypnotic state' for controlled <br>
overriding of sensations from ones' immediate physical environment during <br>
playback.<br>
<p>
A level 2 Attrium introduces the ability to access &amp; experience sensations &amp; <br>
thoughts transmitted by others: at first this might have to be on a download <br>
basis, until some real-time communication mechanism could be established; <br>
but, in any case, implies the ability of the Attrium to generate an <br>
immersive VR able to integrate host proprioceptions along with guest entity <br>
interactions.<br>
<p>
A level 3 Attrium assumes real-time communication, being able to both send &amp; <br>
receive sensations &amp; thoughts between multiple Attriums; which implies <br>
central nervous system integration for fine motor control of Attrium <br>
simulations and an ability to switch fluidly between viewpoints, perhaps <br>
moving rapidly across an environment in one 'window' while being a <br>
stationary observer in another.<br>
<p>
A level 4 Attrium assumes the ability to generate 'ghosts', that is, to <br>
create extracts of ones' mind, personality &amp; proprioceptive sensibilities <br>
for transmission to another Attrium, as well as the ability to host such <br>
ghosts sent from other Attriums.<br>
<p>
07/21/96. RESEARCH AREAS FOR THE FIRST STEP. I don't think even Level 1 <br>
Attriums would be practical using current brain-scanning approaches <br>
(electrodes or MRI) and might depend on the creation of distributed clusters <br>
of molecular processing agents able to record brain activity from within for <br>
later analysis. It might be possible, for specific research subjects, to <br>
develop a code for certain activities that could then trigger signals that <br>
could be read by external devices. Key areas to be explored would include <br>
agents that could simultaneously monitor 'mood' from within the <br>
hormone-filled ventricles of the brain, along with intra-axial agents to map <br>
neural activity. For early studies, volunteers would probably need to keep <br>
detailed diaries of physical &amp; mental activities and moods (which is an <br>
entire discipline in itself!) Controled experiments should focus on finding <br>
reliable and translatable signal patterns associated with subvocalized <br>
thought streams. A practical goal would be a system for handicapped people <br>
that provides a simulated keyboard in their minds that could be used to <br>
capture mentally spelled-out sentences. This could eventually lead to other <br>
simulated displays that a person could be taught to interpret. With the <br>
addition of a memory &amp; search mechanism, such a system would provide the <br>
beginnings of an Attrium Notebook, a thought recorder.<br>
<p>
I know of a few old references to some of these things as well as some newer <br>
references (e.g., Max More's Extropy #16 survey of research at USC); but, <br>
I'm mostly interested in speculations on the software side rather than the <br>
wetware or hardware sides.<br>
