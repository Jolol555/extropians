<p>
Certainly we know, they and companies like them are the only thing that keeps <br>
the entire third world from starving to death, in spite of incredibly stupid <br>
socialist governments that keep pushing things in the direction of poverty.<br>

<p>
<p>
I'm certain that's not true, but if it was, tough.  A word of advice, you're <br>
not going to get much mileage singing the wonders of self sacrifice, at least <br>
not on this list. Altruism is not an Extropian virtue, but on the other hand, <br>
if you want to give me your place in the lifeboat I won't try to talk you out <br>
of it.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;A business is driven to make profits, not make the best                  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;product. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, a wonderful product is of no use if nobody can afford it.<br>
<p>
                         <br>
<i>                &gt;They will cut the corners and do everything in their power                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to keep production costs low as long as it doesn`t undermine                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;consumer interest. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing. They are making a  <br>
product that people like as cheaply as they possibly can. Consumers have <br>
something they like at a price they want to pay, employees have a job,  <br>
stockholders make money, everybody wins.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;You`ll notice that the public is only a small minority of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;people</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You lost me.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;While I don`t like union structures, they are necessary </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Fine, if you want to join a union then join a union, I'm a libertarian and <br>
wouldn't dream of stopping you.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Governments are villainous, I agree, but not as much as big                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;business. [...] if corporations are going to be this evil. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Evil compared to what? States?  Governments, those paragons of charity and  <br>
morality, those defenders of the weak and powerless, the source of all virtue, <br>
have butchered hundreds of millions of people this century alone, often their  <br>
own citizens. Corporations would have to work very hard to break that record.                                <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;the government _gets_ its money by forcefully taking it </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Correct. A corporations may charge more for a product than you want to pay,  <br>
but they don't put a gun to your head and make you buy their "services". <br>
A corporation may not be willing to pay you what you think your time is worth, <br>
but they don't enslave you as governments do when they need labor to serve on <br>
a jury or fight a war. If I tell the government that I'd rather not work for <br>
them, very soon men will knock on my door and make me an offer I can't refuse.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The fact that products like the electric toothbrush,                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;disposable diapers, are  demanded  by the public scares me.                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;[...] Assuming  consumers are enlightened enough to know                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;[what is best for them]. This is where that tool of               </i><br>
<i>                &gt;oppression known as mass media comes in. Advertisers can       </i><br>
<i>                &gt;direct the news by controlling what shows they sponsor. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
What scares me are arguments that the public doesn't know what's best for <br>
it but the speaker, of course, does, so what is needed is a regularity agency <br>
for the mass media that has the exact same values that you do and also has <br>
God's telephone number so it can always tell truth from falsehood and good <br>
from evil and will never be corrupted by its vast power.<br>
