"Sweat-shop 101" is one of the introductory courses in the University of <br>
Capitalism.  The students start out as starving, miserable people, and they<br>
learn the basics of hard work, with the resulting benefit of being able to <br>
live.<br>
<p>
OK. I agree.  In theory. In practise, it works out differently <br>
sometimes:<br>
<p>
Consider the recent scenario of Vietnamese women,<br>
imported with the promise of their first lesson in<br>
Capitalism 101, shipped in by outlaws, imprisoned in<br>
the "sweat shops",  held at gunpoint and forced to work  <br>
subhuman conditions  (BTW, before you all get<br>
your feathers in a ruffle, this was orchestrated<br>
by their own countrymen- not "white male<br>
imperialists"). Under our present government, this <br>
is not legal and it was a scandalous massive <br>
arrest (I do not know what became of the imprisoned<br>
women).  Obviously I think this is slavery<br>
and should not be allowed. It is use of force , but it is certainly<br>
enterprising. <br>
How does one draw the line in an Anar/Capitalist <br>
world?  If not government intervention, then what <br>
should be done about it?<br>
Who advocates for a victim like that, if they cannot <br>
advocate for themselves, if anyone? Or is it NoneofYour Busines/Laissez<br>
Faire.  <br>
