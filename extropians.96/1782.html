<p>
<p>
        But it wasn't the basis.  It was a signature line.  I think that<br>
both you and Greg (and everyone else) understand what Churchill meant by his<br>
quote: "When the eagles are quiet, the parrots begin to jabber."  Not too<br>
much to discuss, let alone base a discussion on.  Again, I intend no<br>
offense; I'm just trying to figure out the need for irrelevant posts.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;To be honest, in the short time that I've been on this list, I've </i><br>
<i>&gt;encountered many posts that have taken quite a nasty tone toward </i><br>
<i>&gt;newcomers to the list.</i><br>
<p>
     <br>
        I don't think it's necessarily newcomers per se, but anyone who has<br>
ill-supported posts or topics is bound to be argued with.  Rightly so.  This<br>
ML is supposed to be for "...well thought out, extropian discussion."  If<br>
it's not well thought out or extropian, don't post it.  If there has been<br>
any 'nastiness', I don't think it was intentional.<br>
