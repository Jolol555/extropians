	The thread thus far has been centered upon relating experiential<br>
data gathered by individuals in their private practice of inducing and/or<br>
harnessing creativity through manipulation and self control of mental<br>
states and awareness.  A few people have asked the question "What works<br>
for you" or "How can I achieve these affects".  The answers have been<br>
numerous but one common theme that I have noticed is that all of the<br>
replies have been purely based upon personal experience.  All of the<br>
advice given has been of a "Try this..." nature, relating what works for<br>
them in some instances.  Most of us have our own methods of inducing<br>
trance-like states or creative "moods of mind" (that's from Poe, by the<br>
way) that are generally very affective, but can we subject it all to a<br>
rigorous analyzation?  Let's turn this thread around and stop looking at<br>
the topic at hand from a "meta-physical" level and start discussing the<br>
biological and chemical reasons, as well as the psychological, that these<br>
events occur.  By understanding why, we can more efficiently help those<br>
that are asking for aid as well as possibly enhance our own practice and<br>
experience.<br>
	Do we know what neurotransmitters and hormones are excreted in<br>
highly creative situations?  I find that when I experience the "altered"<br>
state it is usually with a very small amount of light, what effect does<br>
this have?  It certainly plays a role, but just what exactly is happening?<br>
Too much light spoils it, and no light does as well.  Could it be a<br>
situation where because of the low light level the production of melatonin<br>
is increased making me more sleepy, hence slowing down the occilations of<br>
my beta-waves into a more alpha like pattern?  Is there anyway that we can<br>
produce this in a controlled situation?  As I have said, I can choose a<br>
rough time in which to experienc this "trancendental" state but it is<br>
overall left up to chance (or is it?).  This is just one example, but I<br>
believe that by analyzing all of our situations, particularly those that<br>
have the "experience" as opposed to the ones that have the "insight" (what<br>
I mean is the difference between those that are talking about having the<br>
moods, and those that are talking about having sudden realizations while<br>
doing unrelated activities, but of course they blend together), we can<br>
better understand how and why they occur, and help to reproduce them.<br>
	What affect does music have on the experience?  It has been used<br>
as a tool for such activities for thousands of years.  It's usually<br>
rythmic, repetitive.  It's affects on the delta/theta/alpha/beta system?<br>
Singing. Chanting.  Oxygen deprivation?  Aldous Huxley, in "Heaven and<br>
Hell", states the reason for singing in religion, all of the repetitive<br>
speach, is to deprive the individual of oxygen, inducing visions of god,<br>
which are nothing more than hallucinations.<br>
	Body temperature.  Pulse.  What can we learn from this?  Can we<br>
reason out a general method in which anyone can experience altered states<br>
through concious direction?  Lets help each other better understand<br>
ourselves.  I'm not willing to just accept the fact that I can experience<br>
this, nor even the fact that I can consciously induce it and have a fairly<br>
personal understanding of it.  I want to know why.  Relate your knowledge,<br>
let's pool it together to further ourselves.<br>
