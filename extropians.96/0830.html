&lt;&lt;    The scariest question of all is whether or not numbers can make a<br>
 substantial reality.  Is virtual reality truly real?  If so, what exactly is<br>
 the meaning of reality?  Can there be a bona fide existance within a<br>
 5-cubic-foot encasement?  Can there be life within what another man created?<br>
 *Should* there be life within what another man created?  Can it even be<br>
 classified as life?<br>
 <br>
         These are all very hypothetical, anthropological questions, but they<br>
 are also very valid.  I've never been one to fear progress, but here's<br>
 another question: is it progress?  Or is it regress?<br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 Hmm.... intersting - not only life/not life - progress/regress -  but how<br>
about  the question:<br>
  Is it some kind of heaven or hell? If we arent really "alive" but continue<br>
out of body this sounds like the traditional ethereal  -  also known as an<br>
"afterlife" <br>
Then I had this really scary scary thought - what if  uploading becomes<br>
percieved as a viable, obtainable ( by some?) kind of "TV heaven". This could<br>
be used or abused  by some kind of cult ( or government?)  and  wrong<br>
thinking control freaks dubiously offer it ( or the alternative - VR hell) as<br>
some kind of Nirvana or reward....<br>
((((shudder)))<br>
