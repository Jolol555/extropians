<i>&gt;&gt;Actually, there are a few cetaceans that have a higher brain mass to body</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

We can't communicate well enough to tell.  Their technological development<br>
has been limited by a lack of hands and fire.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;I used to work on DSP applications, mostly audio, but occasionally graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;oriented.  Visual processing applications almost always require an order of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;magnitude more processing power than audio ones.  I have heard the argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;before, but I have a difficult time believing that cetaceans use more of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;their brain for audio processing than we use for vision.  State-of-the-art</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;audio rendering software can run in realtime on a processor capable of less</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;than 200-mips.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does this have to do with blowing virtual air though a virtual model to</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce a sound? I saw on the telivision show "Beyond 2000" a technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;where they would stick a instrument into a person's throat and map out</i><br>
<i>&gt;their voice box with a laser and make a 3D model of it. With the 3D model</i><br>
<i>&gt;they were able to make the person actually sing using the model. When the</i><br>
<i>&gt;internet VR 'metaverse' comes around in say 5-10 yrs max we will be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create characteristic voices for our avatars. Does anyone know of a link to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ongoing research about this topic?</i><br>
<p>
This wasn't exactly what I was talking about, but it is related.<br>
This is a little off-topic, so I will send you more info via private email.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Also, our hearing is more capable than most people think.  I have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;experiments where blind people were able to echo-locate objects with a cross</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;section of 1 square inch in a room using their own voice, and could detect</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;changes in position of 3" at a distance of 15' of objects with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;cross-section of 1 square inch.  Non-blind people tend to only have a range</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of 3-7', but everyone possesses the capability.  I actually took one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;these tests.  My effective range was 5-6'.  Most people don't know they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;do it until they try.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What evolutionary advantage does this pose?</i><br>
<p>
I am not sure it is an advantage.  It is just a capability of human audio<br>
processing.  Limited, to be sure, but an interesting sidebar.  If it was<br>
really advantageous, more people would be using it.<br>
