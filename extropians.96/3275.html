<p>
if so, then you would be giving the lunch buyer the ego satisfaction of<br>
being magnanimous in exchange for the lunch.<br>
<p>
If they bought you lunch cause they like being with you, they are<br>
recieving services in kind, i.e. entertainment. When I lived in Seattle,<br>
I usually was taken to lunch or dinner by freinds 3 times more often<br>
than I was able to reciprocate, because I was 1) an entertaining guy, 2)<br>
the only person who would hang out with them, 3) people were interested<br>
in me or my company for business reasons. In each case, I wound up<br>
paying for it one way or another.<br>
<p>
ALL human relationships are based on free trade, which can be quantified<br>
economically, or qualified emotionally.<br>
<p>
I usually found that the biggest free lunches always had the biggest<br>
costs for me in the end.....<br>
<p>
Suffice it to say, I'm back in New Hampshire as much for the splendid<br>
isolation it provides, as for nearness to family.<br>
TANSTAAFL!!!<br>
