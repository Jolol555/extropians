<i>&gt;&gt; Why are you taking such offense? I'm asking politely. I only aimed my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; message to Max because he is our public spokesperson/representative where</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the mass media is concerned.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, he's not.  He's one of a number of people with opinions, often</i><br>
<i>&gt;called upon to express them.  A number of us have done that.</i><br>
I'd love to be involved with something like this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Every group MUST have a leader to inspire the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mindless lemmingish masses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can't believe you really mean that.</i><br>
<p>
Whats wrong with what I said? This is the reason there has never to my<br>
knowledge been a government without a leader to inspire the people. The<br>
problem is unfortunetly that low intellect people (usually poor) cannot<br>
relate to a process like a group and can only relate to a personality which<br>
explains why Clinton was elected. hehe :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; That is until people become more educated via</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How?</i><br>
What I am about to explain shows 'exactly' how the internet can educate the<br>
masses through trickery. When I was in high school my high school was one of<br>
the first to have net access. At first, very few kids cared to know about<br>
the internet even though it was announced *MANY* times in the school<br>
newspaper. Then kids started seeing websites advertized in their magazines<br>
and on TV and started coming to the net connected computers to look up these<br>
sites of their interest. Once they found the wealth of info available about<br>
their interests on these sites, they started bringing their friends. Then<br>
once they had become exhausted with those sites, they actually started<br>
looking up INTELLIGENT things!! AMAZING! And this wasn't a single case! It<br>
happened over and over and before I used to be one of the few people who<br>
used those computers but now there is a line to get to them and they have a<br>
secretary directing the traffic to them. See the internet CAN educate<br>
America's youth. By the way, this occurred at Redondo Union High School in<br>
Redondo Beach, CA so you can checkup on it if you wish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; In the eyes of the public as yet, Max is the "central extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; authority".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, he isn't.</i><br>
Then who is in the eyes of the mass media. Someone must be? Are do they see<br>
us as a group only without a leader.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A number of us enjoyed Wade's post.  Again, why not ask him yourself?</i><br>
Alright<br>
<p>
Another thing... Who is that FM-2030 guy? I saw him in a review in Skeptic<br>
and nowhere else is he mentioned. Who the hell is that guy?<br>
