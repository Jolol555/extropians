That's obvious. There are huge differences even between members of the <br>
same sex. What you're describing, is an excellent example of sloppy <br>
science. Little wonder, as I know from personal experiences how medical <br>
students are trained/how their "research" usually looks like (of course, <br>
admirable exceptions exist).<br>
<p>

<p>
Obviously, you misunderstood. I was referring to good science, while <br>
medicine does not qualify as science at all. I would be amazed if a <br>
particle physics experiment planned/implemented by a male/female would <br>
produce different results. If reproducible, that would mean the end of <br>
science as we know it.<br>
<p>
However, experimental signatures of males/females differ much more <br>
strongly as between experimentators of the same sex. In chemistry I have <br>
made the observation that women are usually much more meticulous/clean <br>
experimenters, and have much more stamina/are less prone to abandon a <br>
course of experiments due to accumulated frustration.<br>
