When we're uploaded, we'll be able to experience incredibly detailed worlds, <br>
even entire lifetimes.  We could even make the part of ourselves experiencing <br>
the lifetimes forget that they are really an upload, so that the life <br>
experience seems more real, so that we could fully immerse ourselves in the <br>
life experience.<br>
<p>
Considering this, I can't help wondering if this has already happened.  Am I <br>
an upload, living in a virtual world?  I can't think of any way to prove that <br>
I'm NOT living in a virtual world.  Although, there may be ways to prove that <br>
one IS living in a virtual world, although I don't have any strong evidence <br>
for the theory that I AM living in a virtual world.<br>
<p>
Now, I can see a lot of people on this list recoiling from the idea that we <br>
are already living in a virtual world because this would open up the <br>
possiblilty that a lot of the Mystical, New-Age, Religious "bullshit" is <br>
correct.  If we are living in a virtual world, then "miracles" would be very <br>
possible, like special effects in a movie.  It would also open up the <br>
possibility that we DO have some kind of "spirit" or "soul", in relation to <br>
the lifetime we are experiencing (that is, that we have the major part of <br>
ourselves living somewhere else besides this lifetime).<br>
<p>
However, I don't think that it is valid to reject the idea that we are already <br>
living in a virtual world, simply because it opens up the possibilities that <br>
the "irrationalists" are right about certain aspects of reality.  Maybe there <br>
is some truth to what they are saying.  But, then again, maybe not, but I'm <br>
not finding it easy to dismiss the idea that I *MAY* already be living in a <br>
virtual world.  How could I tell the difference?<br>
