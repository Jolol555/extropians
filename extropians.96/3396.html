To put this in perspective, consider this story from the New York Times, <br>
October 27, 1994, about children in an atheistic society:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Bucharest, Romania -- In a drab dormitory, small children old enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; to walk and talk grip the rails of their cribs in frustrated attempts at </i><br>
<i>&gt; locomotion, silently rocking back and forth.  A playroom filled with </i><br>
<i>&gt; toys, a paradise of imagination and exercise donated by foreigners, </i><br>
<i>&gt; remains locked because the children's caretakers consider it too much </i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble to supervise.  The caretakers, women in white uniforms, sit a </i><br>
<i>&gt; few yards away in the corridor, smoking and chatting.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In one crib, the oldest child, 6-year-old Gheorghe, his hair a tousle of </i><br>
<i>&gt; dark curls and his eyes wide and brown, lies on his back, </i><br>
<i>&gt; occasionally managing to pull himself up to peer out of his little prison.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Until a few months ago, when an American volunteer visited, </i><br>
<i>&gt; no one had bothered during Gheorghe's six years of institutional life </i><br>
<i>&gt; to encourage him to sit or stand.  Even the volunteer's interest has </i><br>
<i>&gt; not enabled him to overcome his stunted development.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; ... despite Western help from dozens of charities and some </i><br>
<i>&gt; governments, Romanian babies are still abandoned at alarming rates.  </i><br>
