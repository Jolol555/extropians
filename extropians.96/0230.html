 I can certainly see simple alternatives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But let me just offer one non-partisan "meta-value" that underlies much of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the law of evidence.  Time and judicial resources are limited and disputes</i><br>
<i>&gt;must be resolved within a *reasonable* amount of time.  Thus, there *have* to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be at least some limits on the evidence that can be presented at a trial.</i><br>
<p>
 I see little evidence that a significant fraction of the current rules are<br>
intended to speed up trials or are effective at doing so.<br>
 Complex rules are normally less just than simple rules, because those<br>
special interests who can afford to understand complex rules will be<br>
the only ones able to write the complex rules, whereas the average person<br>
can choose among simple rules. I don't think it is an accident that those<br>
who understand and influence the complex rules are also the ones to whom<br>
power is being shifted by the rules.<br>
 A simple rule that would be more effective at avoiding absurd delays<br>
would be to have the loser pay the costs of the winning side and of the<br>
court system. If that isn't enough, we could add a time limit that keeps<br>
the trial time from exceeding a specified fraction of the prison time at<br>
risk or the trial costs from exceeding a specified fraction of the money<br>
at stake.<br>
