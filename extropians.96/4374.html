Gracious thanks to all who responded to my query about productive habits, <br>
whether it was for my benefit or not.  In either case congrats on <br>
contributing to the overall extropy of the universe!<br>
<p>
I noted some common themes:<br>
	*write stuff down<br>
	*prioritize<br>
	*organize<br>
	*take it with you<br>
Points taken.<br>
<p>
John Satta mentioned the Franklin A, B, C, ranking system.  This sounds <br>
very similar to a system I devised some months ago, but never implimented <br>
b/c it was to cumbersome.  I've been inspired to revise it.<br>
<p>
Something of particular interest is David Musick's suggestion to practice <br>
switching tasks instantaneously.  I've already began working on this <br>
one.  Today I worked on chemical synthesis problems left over from my <br>
organic chem class in the darkroom.  The cytoskeleton lab I work in has a <br>
print processing machine in the darkroom that allows me about 90 seconds <br>
to work on synthesis after I expose the print.  The first triesys look <br>
promising.  I've even christened the skill 'Turbo Switch'!<br>
<p>
Mark Crosby mentioned trend tracking with his HP.  I don't have an HP, <br>
but I do have graph paper and three colors of pens (I need more).  For <br>
most of the semester that just ended (this idea didn't strike me until <br>
after my first round of exams), I tacked my study time for each of my <br>
classes, as well as jam time on my guitar.  I haven't yet crunched any <br>
numbers, but I hope to find some correlation between study time, jam <br>
time, and class performance.  I will, however, have to take it with a <br>
grain of salt, as it was not a scientific investigation.<br>
<p>
I've got almost a month before classes start again so there will be much <br>
time to extrope!<br>
<p>
Exovivo!<br>
