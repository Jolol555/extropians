Eliezer, in response to<br>
Chris Hind:<br>
<i>&gt; if christianity considers science satan than</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could revel in the fact that we're satan worshippers!</i><br>
<p>
(snip)  &gt;We'd - no, you'd - lose<br>
<i>&gt;all credibility, firmly establish your credentials as a &gt;teenage-class</i><br>
<i>&gt;rebellious challenger of the Establishment, and completely &gt;confuse the</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue so that you wind up being taken down with the &gt;apocalyptic loons.</i><br>
<p>
This was an interesting post and brought something to my attention. <br>
Satan is popular because of the religious right. <br>
Marilyn Manson, who has"come out" against the <br>
religious right -attracted gobs of teens.<br>
He is a huge Deathist Entropian, but a hell of a lot of fun.<br>
** But he sells a  LOT of records.<br>
Eli is right. You can't fight a stupid meme with an even stupider one,<br>
because people are too stupid to know the difference.<br>
I WOULD NOT HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS POST:<br>
<p>
However, on refelection, I began to wonder, is there an Extropian<br>
"generation" gap in the making here?<br>
My hypothesis is that most people turned on to Philosophy<br>
(YES, Extropy *is* a philosophy) are very young.<br>
If not teenage years then usually early college. <br>
I also think that people who are raised in the new wave<br>
and beyond will be more open to the memes. They will have grown up with<br>
silicon in the veins, so to speak.<br>
<p>
They will be looking to rebel against their New Age, Hippy/Liberal parents<br>
too, I bet ; - ).<br>
<p>
Max has now been in Wired, "Synthetic Pleasures" etc:<br>
Recently "we" may appear in Time mag.<br>
This can only bring in more people, some may indeed <br>
be (as u say) of "teen-age class".<br>
<p>
Even if teenagers of TODAY aren't charmed by the<br>
Singularity, they will be in years to come as Extropy <br>
grows in the public eye.<br>
Should they not be?<br>
<p>
At this point Extropians are: as the Cyberpunk handbook<br>
(R.U. Sirius) says: "... a tiny minority so we can taunt <br>
them at will.."<br>
<p>
But what may happen as new blood comes in that isn't over forty, over<br>
thirty,over twenty, not quite mature   intellectuals..<br>
Younger than Chris? A generation or two younger than Chris?<br>
<p>
Anyway....<br>
