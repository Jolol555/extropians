Snip of a debate between John and Saresh (Leftilib vs. Anarcaprocy)<br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;How many children don't get an education because they have</i><br>
                <br>
<i>                &gt;to work in sweatshops in order to support themselves. India</i><br>
                <br>
<i>                &gt;is a good example of capitalism running amuck. </i><br>
                      <br>
( john)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their </i><br>
<i>&gt;children less than we do? The reason they send their young children to work </i><br>
in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and &gt;death, you've <br>
said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;stop this child labor, the thing that let's them survive, and that doesn't  </i><br>
<i>&gt;seem like a very smart thing to do, and it CERTAINLY doesn't seem very</i><br>
 humane.<br>
 <br>
It seems as though the major difference I see here is in the simple<br>
assumption that one either CAN or CAN'T protect the "starving masses" from<br>
the greed of others. One crucial element , and one I keep harping (angelic)<br>
on is *changing*<br>
 the moral systems that keep people doing what they are doing...<br>
     <br>
  Saresh, you seem to feel that these people are too dumb and/or helpless to<br>
take care of thier own needs or political choices and you will make them for<br>
them.  John you seem to think that they are fully aware of the choices that<br>
they make and have the critical faculties and/or ability to empower<br>
themselves and do that which is in their best interests.<br>
I say that with current memes (including, In India for example,  Hinduism and<br>
other religions that assert that suffering is a good thing, or one's proper<br>
place in the scheme of things) give us access to a vast "meme- deficiency"<br>
data base that needs to be addressed. If we're going to achieve an<br>
anarcho-capitalist freedom, I propose that  most of the developed planet<br>
needs a big Codependant's Anonymous meeting, and the rest of the <br>
(3rd world?) planet needs to go to Catholics (or substitue any mindless<br>
acceptance of suffering and subordination with the promise of a better<br>
afterlife) Anonymous.<br>
