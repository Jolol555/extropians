 If we were frogs or bisons, we would still find the other sex<br>
attractive and desirable, wouldn't we?  We would just develop<br>
a different set of "beauty recognition" criteria.<br>
<p>
 In the circumstances where males due to greater strength and<br>
ability to mate with more partners than females, play a more<br>
active role in partner selection, it is natural that they will<br>
have stronger feeling of preference ( = "sense of beauty"), and<br>
female[ gene-set]s would concentrate on developing bodies<br>
corresponding to these preferences.  The evolved male-specific<br>
parts of the beauty-recognition system may have been shared with<br>
females after it was developed in males; I would expect that<br>
gender-specific genes would occasionally mix - just to test<br>
whether one sex's invention may be of use for the other.<br>
That's how you can find nipples on men or same-sex preferences.<br>
(That's all my speculation).<br>
<p>
Some recognition criteria may be too broad and exploited in<br>
"perversions" - I think sexy ("aerodynamic") curves played a<br>
significant role in my buying a Saturn, or our liking panthers,<br>
vases, or paintings. Same with voices, etc.<br>
As the population needs a diverse set of physical features,<br>
it needs a diverse set of aesthetic preferences; these sets<br>
coevolve, both driving and mirroring each other.<br>
<p>
On another note:<br>
<p>
 I used to feel somewhat embarrassed of having a preference for<br>
females in *friendly* conversations; I have a definite sexual<br>
preference here, but I didn't like thinking that I choose a<br>
woman for a friend only because I (subconsciously) find her<br>
promising as a sexual objects. Later I figured it out:  I like<br>
discussing personal issues with people who are sensitive and<br>
have expressive faces.  With that present, the gender doesn't<br>
matter [that much].  Unfortunately, males seem naturally less<br>
sensitive - and most regretfully, in the course of social<br>
"progress" they squashed much of their innate sensitivity<br>
with the outgrowth of macho behavior, where displaying<br>
emotions, wearing makeup, paying attention to little personal<br>
interactions, etc. are strongly discouraged.<br>
<p>
  So instead of using social and technological progress to<br>
overcome personal limitations here, people use them to aggravate<br>
the situation.   Not all people, of course...<br>
