<i>&gt;&gt; It is quite impossible to tell random from pseudorandom, </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why is it impossible?  If that's a theorem, I would like to see the proof.    </i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyway the problem here is not to distinguish random from </i><br>
<i>&gt;pseudorandom.  The problem is to distinguish among the many </i><br>
<i>&gt;different kinds of pseudorandomness.    </i><br>
<p>
A good pseudo-random number generator is indistinguishable from a true set<br>
of random numbers.  The RC4 stream cipher (= PRNG) is a case in point.  The<br>
output has a totally white spectrum.  The only thing that makes it<br>
"pseudorandom" is that it is generated deterministically.  The output is<br>
indistinguishable from non-deterministic random noise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The only way to tell them apart would try a serious cryptoattack, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which is a very costly business.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So it's costly.  When the government feels seriously threatened,   </i><br>
<i>&gt;they will spend astonomical amounts of money to defend themselves.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Cryptography is now classified as munitions, and the NSA may emerge </i><br>
<i>&gt;as a branch of the military, with the same standing as the Army, Navy, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and Air Force, and with a comparable budget.   </i><br>
<p>
You misunderstand the nature of modern cryptography.  The computational<br>
complexity is exponential.  *Many* common encryption algorithms today could<br>
not be broken even if the entire GNP of the country was applied towards<br>
computational capability.<br>
<p>
For example, no amount of budget would allow the NSA to crack an IDEA<br>
encrypted message.  There isn't enough computational capability available.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;: but the NSA could see the difference.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; But not _casually_. That's the point.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why is that the point?  There is nothing casual about this.  Recognizing </i><br>
<i>&gt;the various kinds of pseudorandom sequences produced by various </i><br>
<i>&gt;encryption schemes is not easy; neither is finding submarines in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;ocean.  But neither problem is impossible.  Suppose NSA has a budget </i><br>
<i>&gt;as big as the Navy's budget.  Then a lot of things become possible.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is true that universal encryption would make the NSA's task more </i><br>
<i>&gt;difficult.  Instead of using chips that make a simple distinction between </i><br>
<i>&gt;low-entropy and high-entropy messages, they would have to </i><br>
<i>&gt;continually upgrade their chips to make more and more fine-grained </i><br>
<i>&gt;distinctions, and they would have to use other methods as well.  </i><br>
<p>
Today people have a fairly broad choice of crypto algorithms that would<br>
produce output that essentially requires that the NSA know what algorithm<br>
was used.  The entropy of many encryption methods used today is so high as<br>
to be indistinguishable from noise.<br>
