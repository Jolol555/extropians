<p>
But laughing in my face isn't an argument, Ian, and you aren't presenting <br>
any arguments either. Why should the members of the conspiratorial elite <br>
prefer the illusory (for it is illusory) sense of control over other <br>
people's lives to drastically improved chances of personal immortality <br>
and vast expansion of access to natural resources (offplanet)?<br>
<p>
I agree with you that current governmental institutions need to be <br>
radically changed in a libertarian direction, but I think incompetence <br>
explains why things are bad right now far more effectively than malice <br>
explains it.<br>
<p>
As Twirlip of Greymist said, poverty seems to be the default. Likewise, <br>
authoritarianism has been the default for a very long time now, and it <br>
takes a while for everyone to wake up from that way of thinking. I think <br>
that conspiracy theories arise from unbridled impatience to wake everyone <br>
up. "They aren't all realizing that libertarianism is true? The only <br>
possible explanation: conspiracy!"  But intellectual laziness and inertia <br>
(plus the fact that things have been improving overall thanks to <br>
technology, despite the fact that the governments have been preventing <br>
them from improving as fast as they might have otherwise) are better <br>
explanations, I think. These are hard problems, and we have to solve them <br>
on their terms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Control itself is the goal for political types.</i><br>
<p>
And why do they limit themselves to only a single goal, even at the <br>
ultimate cost of their lives?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; In short, to hold up your argument, you need to show that it is in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; interests of the governing elite to enslave the population of the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: No -- to hold up the argument one need only show that they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; working overtime to reduce freedoms. They are... any questions ? </i><br>
<p>
Well, that's presuming that the conspiracy exists at all. The only <br>
evidence I've seen of a ruling-class conspiracy is the curious activities <br>
of H. Ross Perot, which seem to me utterly ineffective in the long term.<br>
<p>
I was trying to charitably suspend my disbelief in the conspiracy, but<br>
since you aren't interested in trying to understand and explain to me the<br>
*motivations* of the conspiracy you believe in, I'll return to my ordinary<br>
belief that the "conspiracy" is really just a bunch of deluded individuals<br>
doing what they each wrongly think is best. <br>
<p>
My very limited studies of the activities of the very worst, most violently <br>
immoral elements of government have led me to the conclusion that these <br>
elements are too incompetent to conspire to run a supermarket, much less <br>
conspire to run a planet.<br>
