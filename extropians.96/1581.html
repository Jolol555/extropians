<i>&gt;  &lt;&lt;"I hate and fear government as much as anyone, but I also fear corporate </i><br>
<i>&gt;  tyranny, and as long as private interests are this selfish and greedy, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; will </i><br>
<i>&gt;  pay my taxes to help out my fellow man." &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When you buy from a business, you directly help me, your fellow man, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; paying my salary.   Is that greedy or selfish of me and my big-business</i><br>
<i>&gt; employer?</i><br>
Yes, because you arent getting the direct amount you should from your<br>
labour. Instead, money is being soaked up by "management", where the<br>
coordinators are paid more than the workers. This kind of top-down<br>
structure reeks of a closed fascism, where the guy at the top gives the<br>
orders and the men/women at the bottom have to take it or leave. here`s <br>
no room for negotiation. <br>
Business assumes that the workers aren`t competent to run a business by <br>
themselves. I`m a big advocate of co-ops.    <br>
<i>&gt; There is nothing more selfish or greedy than a government who spends probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; 100%+ of my tax dollars on interest payments (I call it the "blackhole").  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Interest payments on debts taken out for (under Reagan) arms<br>
manufacturing, which gives businesses more lucrative contracts than they<br>
could possibly get from consumer items. More money goes towards corporate<br>
subsidies than  welfare. <br>
<i>&gt; That tax money goes to pay someone else's salary probably not even in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Western Hemisphere.  Because of this, the tax money doesn't really go for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; things you think it does.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I consider a person outside the western hemisphere my fellow man. <br>
<i>&gt; Besides, taxes increase business operating costs forcing my company to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; my salary or lay me off.  When you pay your taxes you do not help me.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Really, so this justifies the less than 5 percent tax business pays versus<br>
the much higher (15%) taxes us "commoners" have to pay. <br>
<i>&gt; However, I do not expect to be helped by you or others for "free".  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want government charity either.   I think you and I must _both_ make a</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfying exchange (e.g.monitary) or I perfer NO deal at all.  If you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; think my business is worth buying from, you should not buy from me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yes, this is because you are likely to have talents that get you ahead in<br>
the current economy. However, there are those that arent as fortunate. If<br>
we are in this kind of "must screw over" other people circumstances, some<br>
people are going to get screwed. some very Talented people cannot get<br>
ahead without<br>
being ruthlessly greedy.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Certainly we know, they and companies like them are the only thing that keeps </i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire third world from starving to death, in spite of incredibly stupid </i><br>
<i>&gt; socialist governments that keep pushing things in the direction of poverty.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The strongest bulwark of the capitalist system is the ignorance of its <br>
victims. -Adolf Fischer<br>
Echoes of Jeane Kirkpatrick here.<br>
Obviously you don't. Believe what the news tells you, it`s safe. Nigeria <br>
has a very very repressive dictatorship,<br>
capitalist to the extreme, but backed by  arms sales from shell, so<br>
Shell can move in and drill oil. Because Shell has the government in its<br>
pocket, and so no environmental regulations are imposed. The Ogoni people<br>
live on the land being drilled, and thanks top those very crop unfriendly<br>
oil residues that perpetually come from the extraction of the black fluid,<br>
they are starving. Anyone who opens their mouth in protest is imprisoned.<br>
Read about Ken Saro-Wiwa.   <br>
Also Nicaragua, Chile, El Salvador and every other country the U.S. <br>
secretly invaded was to preserve U.S. markets or secure resources for <br>
U.S. businesses. Socialist governments that have been tried have been <br>
attacked(I.e. Nicaragua) and often handicapped by the U.S. leaning on it <br>
until it croaks. The Soviets were even worse, but this was a fault of the <br>
bureaucracy and elite control rather than the concept of equality.<br>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;face it, folks, our freedom is built on other </i><br>
peoples                 &gt;                 &gt;oppression.                  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm certain that's not true, but if it was, tough.  A word of advice, you're </i><br>
<i>&gt; not going to get much mileage singing the wonders of self sacrifice, at least </i><br>
<i>&gt; not on this list. Altruism is not an Extropian virtue, but on the other hand, </i><br>
<i>&gt; if you want to give me your place in the lifeboat I won't try to talk you out </i><br>
<i>&gt; of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                        </i><br>
Because Altruism isn an extropian virtue we shouldn practice it? If<br>
humanity is truly going to ascend and take our place in the universe,<br>
a then we need to cultivate a sense of respect and a little bit of<br>
compassion for each other, else the future will be a class war on a<br>
nanogod level. <br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;A business is driven to make profits, not make the best                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;product. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, a wonderful product is of no use if nobody can afford it.</i><br>
The thing is, a wonderful product is of use to the few that can afford it.<br>
Like the 358 people that own 45% of the worlds wealth. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                          </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;They will cut the corners and do everything in their power                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;to keep production costs low as long as it doesn`t undermine                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;consumer interest. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing. They are making a  </i><br>
<i>&gt; product that people like as cheaply as they possibly can. Consumers have </i><br>
<i>&gt; something they like at a price they want to pay, employees have a job,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; stockholders make money, everybody wins.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;You`ll notice that the public is only a small minority of                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;people</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You lost me</i><br>
Which doesn`t seem too hard.<br>
 what I mean is that the markets that most <br>
companies aim to are the affluent. Not a whole lot of demand for electric <br>
toothbrushes  outside the Western World.                  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;While I don`t like union structures, they are necessary </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fine, if you want to join a union then join a union, I'm a libertarian and </i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't dream of stopping you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Governments are villainous, I agree, but not as much as big                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;business. [...] if corporations are going to be this evil. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evil compared to what? States?  Governments, those paragons of charity and  </i><br>
<i>&gt; morality, those defenders of the weak and powerless, the source of all virtue, </i><br>
<i>&gt; have butchered hundreds of millions of people this century alone, often their  </i><br>
<i>&gt; own citizens. Corporations would have to work very hard to break that record.                                </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
Governments acting in business interests. I hope government will actually<br>
live up to the philosophy behind it, but while the money<br>
flows from elite hands, I doubt it will. Most politician are looking for a<br>
nice cushy CEO job after their term, so of course theyll mess with policy<br>
until their future employers are happy. Look at Indonesia, the government<br>
there is good friends with Nike, Gap, Brie-X etc, and they keep that<br>
friendship by crushing any attempts at labour reform. Good government to<br>
these people means a well-armed riot battalion. It 's very different here,<br>
because the elites have the people in their pocket with misinformation and<br>
propaganda. Business and Government share the same interests:keeping the<br>
elite in power. While I'm not opposed to an elite, I am opposed to it<br>
being a stupid short sighted one. Any elite should look ack at the rest <br>
of the people and aim to educate and improve the rest with their gifts, <br>
not hoard information and power. <br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;the government _gets_ its money by forcefully taking it </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Correct. A corporations may charge more for a product than you want to pay,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; but they don't put a gun to your head and make you buy their "services". </i><br>
<i>&gt; A corporation may not be willing to pay you what you think your time is worth</i><br>
They take all of some peoples time and don`t give enough money to feed <br>
them. A farmer not having enough to eat because he is told by the <br>
landowners to grow coffee and tobacco bothers me. <br>
<i>&gt; but they don't enslave you as governments do when they need labor to serve on </i><br>
<i>&gt; a jury or fight a war. If I tell the government that I'd rather not work for </i><br>
<i>&gt; them, very soon men will knock on my door and make me an offer I can't refuse.                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The fact that products like the electric toothbrush,                </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;disposable diapers, are  demanded  by the public scares me.                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;[...] Assuming  consumers are enlightened enough to know                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;[what is best for them]. This is where that tool of               </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;oppression known as mass media comes in. Advertisers can       </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;direct the news by controlling what shows they sponsor. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What scares me are arguments that the public doesn't know what's best for </i><br>
<i>&gt; it but the speaker, of course, does, so what is needed is a regularity agency </i><br>
<i>&gt; for the mass media that has the exact same values that you do and also has </i><br>
<i>&gt; God's telephone number so it can always tell truth from falsehood and good </i><br>
<i>&gt; from evil and will never be corrupted by its vast power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Sorry, that came out sort of wrong. No censorship, ever. What I <br>
mean is that media is owned by the elite, so the channels of communication are geared to elite tastes, <br>
with enough electronic prozac to keep the masses from wanting to take the <br>
airwaves back. I think public communication should be open to <br>
the public. Sort of like Ralph Naders proposed Audience Network. If media <br>
continues regurgitating establishment lines, no alternative forums of <br>
thought can be heard, which is good only for the establishment. If we`re <br>
lucky, the internet will alleviate this, but from what I see, nope, <br>
simply because it costs a lot to get on. The same <br>
news is echoed back at us from every major network with the exact same <br>
spin. I have no access to truth(tm) from anywhere. <br>
<p>
Do you think the media has the interests of open <br>
discussion in mind? &gt; <br>
