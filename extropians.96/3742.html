<i>&gt;From: Paul Wakfer &lt;70023.3041@CompuServe.COM&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;I would like to see what others think of my idea. I do not think that</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy is "evil", but simply that it is counterproductive to communications</i><br>
<i>&gt;and to mutual understanding in human relations.</i><br>
<p>
I respectfully disagree, even tho' I suppose it's possible that an advanced<br>
transhuman might improve his brain to the point of never doing anything or<br>
having any thoughts he didn't mind sharing with everyone else.  However,<br>
regarding those &lt;TH (less than transhuman) . . . A few examples: Daydreaming<br>
or fantasizing about strange things (most creative types do this) that you<br>
wouldn't want certain other people to know about.  Mistaken thoughts that<br>
you later correct, but only after others learn of your mistakes.  (A big<br>
part of the creative thinking process is coming up with novel ideas,<br>
thinking them through, weeding out the bad ones, etc.)  There are plenty of<br>
things that others don't need -- and might not WANT -- to know, e.g., what I<br>
look like in the shower, sitting on the toilet, or having sex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a person who has high self esteemm, ie. is proud of all his/her thoughts and</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions should have no need for any privacy and, in fact, should be completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;happy to have these things all open to the public.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have stated many times that my desire to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communuicate with fidelity what I am is so great (and I seem not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish this by standard interpersonal methods), that I would very much</i><br>
<i>&gt;welcome a human augmentation which would allow us all to transmit and receive</i><br>
<i>&gt;each others thoughts. I have stated that if such an augmentation were possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally better</i><br>
<i>&gt;world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever they</i><br>
<i>&gt;liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<p>
I can't imagine this bringing anything but misery.  If everyone received<br>
everyone else's thoughts, there would be a helluva lot of noise.<br>
<p>
