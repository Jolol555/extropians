        Some might say that this poem is not really transhuman or extropian,<br>
but I would tend to disagree.  A lot of poetry (this one in particular)<br>
leaves a lot of the assumption up to the individual reader.  In this poem, I<br>
strayed away from close detail of the events which occur.  I find it is not<br>
neccessary in this.<br>
        It might help if you know the Greek myth of 'Narcissus' prior to<br>
reading this poem.<br>

<p>
THE OAK AND THE POOL<br>
<p>
<p>
I was on my way to ecstasy<br>
A sojourn to the unknown<br>
My life had made a mess of me<br>
I needed to atone<br>
Happiness was coming<br>
There was no need to be scared<br>
Though my fear was almost numbing<br>
I went forward with my teeth bared<br>
My eyes opened on solitude<br>
A thing I never had<br>
It totally changed my attitude<br>
The silence made me glad<br>
I was in a forest glen<br>
Near a reflective pool<br>
Far from any men<br>
Away from any rule<br>
I walked slowly to an oak tree<br>
It stood upon the pool's rim<br>
This was a place I wanted to be<br>
I decided to go for a swim<br>
But I saw my own reflection<br>
And I presumed it was bonafide<br>
I gazed hard with affection<br>
For the pool mirrored my inside<br>
I'd never thought much of vanity<br>
Or believed in total peace<br>
But when I saw that image of me<br>
I hoped it would never cease<br>
I stared for hours on end<br>
I couldn't look away<br>
And I soon began to depend<br>
On the pool and it's colours gay<br>
Then suddenly it hit me<br>
As I watched the water reflect<br>
That no matter what I could see<br>
There is no such thing as perfect<br>
There is always more to be found<br>
Always further to go<br>
More to be unbound<br>
Always more to know<br>
So I quickly broke my gaze<br>
<i>&gt;From the enchanting pool</i><br>
I would not spend all my days<br>
As a catatonic fool<br>
I got away as fast as I could<br>
<i>&gt;From the pool and oak</i><br>
Escaped the mystical wood<br>
And its perceptual joke<br>
I have a moment of reflection<br>
Every now and then<br>
I ponder on perfection<br>
And think about that glen<br>
It allowed me to perceive<br>
What I never would have guessed:<br>
It is what man does not achieve<br>
That makes him strive to be the best<br>
