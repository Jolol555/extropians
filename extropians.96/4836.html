<p>
The conventional ways to measure computational capability of the NSA are <br>
inadequate.  The NSA is using static memory driven logic to achieve <br>
higher orders of performance than any typically recognized high speed <br>
computer and that is of great interest to many and publicly disclosed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;: but the NSA could see the difference.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; But not _casually_. That's the point.  </i><br>
<p>
James Bamfords, 'The Puzzle Palace', has as one significant gist, SIGINT, <br>
that is the tool the NSA likes more than crackig codes.  Interpretation <br>
of who, sent what types of message to whom when adn the subsequent chains <br>
therein generated lead to far more answers than any encrypted mesage <br>
unscrolled with much easier objectivity in what the meaning in the end is!<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Today people have a fairly broad choice of crypto algorithms that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce output that essentially requires that the NSA know what algorithm</i><br>
<i>&gt; was used.  The entropy of many encryption methods used today is so high as</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be indistinguishable from noise. -James Rogers  jamesr@best.com</i><br>
<p>
The headers on most methods of encryption reveal adequate amounts of<br>
detail for SIGINT analysis to yield what was used.  The packet flows show<br>
source and destination along with intercept time, the when.  Extropians<br>
ought to develop SIGINT techniques to locate NODAL information flows<br>
(Idoru - by William Gibson thematically popularized the notion and<br>
importance) with a public domain or GNU style effort.  <br>
<p>
Of course the Puzzle Palace will be watching and probably learn something,<br>
but the point is, that we would have a super-powerful knowledge tool box<br>
heretofore locked behind mysterious doors.  IF GNU style is economically<br>
inadequate, Java based tools may make for a revenue generator for a new<br>
venture! <br>
<p>
FYI - The reason PGP raised the hackles of those suited and hatted <br>
mathematically trapped like Kirkegaards Cat in a box of black body <br>
radiation is that the SIGINT analysis falls apart a great deal when one <br>
system is ubiquituous with a large audience and anonymous remailers etc. <br>
skew the statistical analysis to the point of unuseability.  Therefore, <br>
popularity and anonymity defeat most of the intelligence through siginals <br>
handily and now you know one big giga-secret!<br>
<p>
Java Beans, PGP, Anonymity and new Anonymous Web Enabled and conveyance <br>
via proxy (cookie free of course) will lead to the next revolution in <br>
denial of signal intelligence service.  <br>
<p>
Keywords to look for include, SIGINT, Programmable Logic, High <br>
Performance, PGP, Java, Java Beans, Transposition Cipher, Spread <br>
Spectrum, Poly Mode Communication, Blended Communication, Nodal Point, <br>
