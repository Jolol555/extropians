<i>&gt;Wouldnt it have been better protocol to arrange a meeting with Max and</i><br>
<i>&gt;discuss it, or some other place, and then work with the Institute in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;positive way?</i><br>
<p>
"Extropy" is a word for an idea. Discussing a better form for its<br>
definition - in an open forum that concerns it - seems like a good,<br>
appropriate, interesting, and even obvious thing to do. Now if only<br>
somebody would think of something useful, and post back to this thread! ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I usually send people to the website (not here)  if they are curious to know</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I mean when I say I'm an Extropian. They usually come back with a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear idea of the principles.</i><br>
<p>
I would like to be able to begin a discussion of extropy without requiring<br>
my conversation partners to learn many new words or digest a lot of text.<br>
The meme market is tough. Attention is a precious resource. I would like to<br>
try not to befuddle those who would otherwise be immediately sympathetic to<br>
the cause if I did a better job.<br>
<p>
Since it's a question I get asked a lot, I am trying to make it more easily<br>
communicable for me. That's what I mean by better. I hope to benefit by it;<br>
others may also. Hair-splitting doesn't interest me - communicating<br>
powerfully does.<br>
