<i>&gt;     My absurd assertion was to get you and James to come up </i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the depth for a real discussion of Darwinian Evolution.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what depth I'm supposed to come up from.  Also, I'm not <br>
sure what James has to do with this;  my original statement was made to  <br>
Eric Watt Forste, and Tim Freeman replied.  I don't recall that James <br>
commented on this.  <br>
<p>
I was using the term "Darwinian" loosely.  I am not at all committed to <br>
the idea that Darwin's mechanism of natural selection is the whole <br>
story.  To get an argument on that point you should bait Dawkins, not <br>
me.  <br>
<p>
I certainly agree that this subject is important and worth discussing at <br>
length.  But is this the right forum in which to do it?  I am less and less <br>
convinced that unstructured e-mail arguments are a productive use of <br>
anybody's time.  <br>
<p>
I am going to open an on-line university.  The curriculum will be quite <br>
different from any existing university.  The concept of causality will be <br>
explored from many angles.  The origin of species will be one of our <br>
main concerns.  The discussion will be structured in such a way as to <br>
avoid pointless semantic arguments, flameouts, and other unpleasant <br>
phenomena of e-mail lists.  Stay tuned.  <br>
<p>
