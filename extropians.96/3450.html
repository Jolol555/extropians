<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;While not at all Extropian in</i><br>
<i>&gt;content, I'd recommend a reading of the unusual fantasy novel</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Always coming Home" by Ursula LeGuin. While set in a "primitive" human</i><br>
<i>&gt;future, it slowly becomes clear that there has been a split during the</i><br>
<i>&gt;singularity in which "The city of Mind" (computer enhanced intelligences)</i><br>
<i>&gt;has long since left Earth, but remains (just) in contact with "the city</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Man", who stick (by choice) with their purely human emotions and</i><br>
<i>&gt;motivations. They [the computers? -sw] regard the remaining bands</i><br>
<i>&gt;of humans as a small but vital part of the Earth ecosystem which they</i><br>
<i>&gt;[the computers? -sw] have rebuilt after a collapse. I'm pretty sure that</i><br>
<i>&gt;LeGuin meant the readers to identify with</i><br>
<i>&gt;occupants of the City of Man... My mileage certainly differed.</i><br>
<p>
I got a completely different reading, confirmed by a question-answer<br>
period at the end of a reading (of other stuff) by LeGuin herself.<br>
<p>
As I read it, at some point in the past, humans had "tamed" technology,<br>
"put it in its place," and that place was mostly to store archives and do<br>
science.  After taming technology, the humans had gone back to ways of<br>
life that respected the ecology, etc., and this is what restored the Earth.<br>
<p>
So in the story there were islands where there were computers and people<br>
who used them, and computers on space probes, and otherwise most people<br>
had little use for computers or any high tech stuff.<br>
<p>
I remember thinking that this dismissed the question of taming technology<br>
pretty lightly, so I asked LeGuin, was it just a literary device to get<br>
tech out of the way and focus on the main issues of the story, or...?<br>
<p>
At this point she got quite incensed (sp?).  She said no, it was the whole<br>
point of the book: technology should be put in its place.  If so, I don't<br>
remember the book giving much of a clue how.  Perhaps the story was meant<br>
to show *why* it would be better that way, but how?  With this and Bob<br>
Grahme's interpretation, I have two reasons to reread the book.<br>
<p>
Btw, I recommend it to people who have Taoist leanings, who yearn for<br>
simplicity.  Get the version with the audio cassette.  *As I recall*, the<br>
book is written from the point of view of an anthropologist from...?...and<br>
the cassette is excerpts from her field tapes.  They sound like real tapes<br>
of real people from a culture you've never heard of, and the sense that<br>
you're listening to voices and sounds from the future that's in<br>
this book is really cool.<br>
