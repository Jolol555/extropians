As far as scenarios (to make this more concrete), Tipler's scenario seems to<br>
offer true immortality, so at least one example of a possible means does exist.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is a bit curious to me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;since one of the main driving forces behind my leaving Xtianity (and </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ultimately bumping into transhumanism)that the idea of truly eternal </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;life ceased to automatically be appealing or even make any sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes immortality won't make sense from our viewpoint today because we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be so incredibly modified that we cannot understand it in our current</i><br>
<i>&gt; position. Hmmm. How would being a immortal uploaded digital being feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; like? There have been posts based entirely on this fact. In my opinion to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a true atheist and not take technological immortality on faith, you must</i><br>
<i>&gt; not make immortality your primary goal and point of focus. Extending life</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can make a primary goal but not immortality itself because then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; turns into faith.</i><br>
<p>
	<br>
The point was that understanding what is to be uploaded (or otherwise<br>
increased) and understanding what it is to be immortal are conceptually two <br>
different things.  The "gods" that we'd like to become are going to face the <br>
same difficulties with temporal eternity that an ordinary human would.<br>
	In particular, any immortal has to face up to the bizarre nature of an<br>
infinite "quantity."  The way one makes sense of an infinity is of course as a<br>
limit, a mathematical abstraction.  Consider the limit of f(x)=C/x as x goes <br>
to  infinity, where c is a constant.  To connect this to eternal life, C <br>
could be some arbitrarily large but finite span of time in your eternal life <br>
(say, a centillion years for dramatic effect), and x can be the overall amount <br>
of time in your life (this is how one has to make sense of temporal eternity).<br>
 The limit we are considering is of course zero time units.  What does that <br>
mean, precisely?  It means that for any real number delta, no matter how <br>
small, there is a real number R such that for all x&gt;R time units, f(x)&lt;delta. <br>
(since limits aren't usually done formally with dimensions, i might not have <br>
the definition quite right in that aspect.)<br>
	So say we've lived a centillion years out of our eternal life.  The <br>
above definition means that you can pick any arbitrarily small number(say <br>
10 to the minus 100th for the fun of it) and there will come a time when the<br>
proportion of your life to date that that centillion years makes up is less <br>
than the delta you have picked, which is next to nothing. But we could have <br>
picked any C, and any delta, with the same result. Any amount of time will <br>
fade to nothing in comparison to the whole.     <br>
	Certainly one of things most important to the nature of any being's <br>
"way of existence" is its relationship to time.  In achieving eternity, a <br>
being's relationship to time is #qualitatively#, not merely quantitatively, <br>
altered.  For one thing, phrases like "the consequences of one's actions" have<br>
fundamentally different meanings.  Why do tommorrow what you can do a zillion <br>
years from now? <br>
	This is all just as true for an upload as it is for a human.  One can <br>
easily reply that well, so the uploads will have to change the way they relate<br>
to time.  Fine, but how can we then claim that they're Us in any meaningful <br>
sense?<br>
