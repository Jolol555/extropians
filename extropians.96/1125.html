           Witnesses Confirm Missile Took Down TWA 800<br>
<p>
                        by J. Orlin Grabbe<br>
<p>
        An article from the *New York Post* (reproduced below) cites FBI<br>
interviews with 154 credible witnesses that a missile took down TWA Flight<br>
800.<br>
<p>
        In my original post on the subject, "The Downing of TWA Flight<br>
800," on July 23, I said the normal normal procedure for personnel who<br>
have received intelligence training (in this case Syria-trained terrorists)<br>
would have been to fire the missile from a small boat off shore.  In<br>
subsequent posts, "Bill Clinton's Choo-Choo" and "The Phosphorous-Headed<br>
Missile and TWA Flight 800", I clarified that the missile was targeted at<br>
the center, or belly, fuel tank.  A couple of months later, the *Post* now<br>
comes belatedly comes to the same conclusion:<br>
<p>
        "Law-enforcement sources said the hardest evidence<br>
        gathered so far overwhelmingly suggests a surface-to-air<br>
        missile -- with the sophisticated ability to lock on the<br>
        center of a target rather than its red-hot engines -- was<br>
        fired from a boat off the Long Island coast to bring down<br>
        the airliner July 17."<br>
<p>
        Only two details are lacking for the *Post* to have the entire<br>
story.  First, they need to disregard the FBI's falsified figure of<br>
13,700 for the altitude at which the plane was hit (the real number is<br>
about 7,600 feet).  Secondly, they need to figure out it was the forward<br>
end, or head, of the missile that was glowing.  As noted in a *New York<br>
Times* article about one of the missile photographs, "It is in a roughly<br>
horizontal position, although its left end is tilted downward.  Its right<br>
end seems to be brightly lighted." ("Is that a Missile? Snapshot on Night<br>
of Air Crash Turns Hot," New York Times, August 26, 1996).<br>
<p>
        And why was the elevated end, or head, of the missile glowing?<br>
As I previously reported, the ordinary head of the Stinger had been replaced<br>
with two small attachments--the first one containing a different guidance<br>
system that allowed the missile to lock-in on the center fuel tank, the<br>
second one being a phosphorous head that was designed to blow up fuel tanks<br>
in a violently effective manner.<br>
<p>

TWA Probers: Missile Witnesses "Credible"<br>
<p>
By MURRAY WEISS<br>
Criminal Justice Editor<br>
<p>
More than 150 "credible" witnesses -- including several scientists --<br>
have told the FBI and military experts they saw a missile destroy TWA<br>
Flight 800, The Post has learned.<br>
<p>
Sources provided startling new details from the frustrating two-month<br>
probe -- persuading agents to acknowledge that the witnesses' accounts<br>
point toward a missile:<br>
<p>
The FBI interviewed 154 "credible" witnesses -- including scientists,<br>
schoolteachers, Army personnel and business executives -- who<br>
described seeing a missile heading through the sky just before Flight<br>
TWA 800 exploded.<br>
<p>
"Some of these people are extremely, extremely credible," a top<br>
federal official said.<br>
<p>
Sources said the witnesses lived or were vacationing along Long<br>
Island's South Shore in Nassau and Suffolk counties when they saw the<br>
object heading toward the sky.<br>
<p>
"When we asked what they saw and where they saw it, the witnesses out<br>
east pointed to the west, and the people to the west pointed to the<br>
east ," one source said.<br>
<p>
FBI technicians mapped the various paths -- points in the sky where<br>
the witnesses said they saw the rising "flare-like" object -- and<br>
determined that the "triangulated" convergence point was virtually<br>
where the jumbo jet initially exploded.<br>
<p>
Struck by the number and confidence of the witnesses, the FBI sat down<br>
many of the witnesses with U.S. military experts, who debriefed them<br>
and independently confirmed for the FBI that their descriptions<br>
matched surface-to-air missile attacks.<br>
<p>
"The military experts told us that what the witnesses were describing<br>
was consistent with a missile," a federal official acknowledged. "They<br>
told us, "You know what they are describing is a missile.' "<br>
<p>
Law-enforcement sources said the hardest evidence gathered so far<br>
overwhelmingly suggests a surface-to-air missile -- with the<br>
sophisticated ability to lock on the center of a target rather than<br>
its red-hot engines -- was fired from a boat off the Long Island coast<br>
to bring down the airliner July 17.<br>
<p>
That theory would have the attackers launching their missile from a<br>
boat and fleeing north into Canada during the confusion immediately<br>
after the explosion. Investigators are reviewing an anonymous threat<br>
received after the Oct. 1, 1995, conviction of radical sheik Omar<br>
Abdel Rahman, a law-enforcement source said.<br>
<p>
The threat was that a New York area airport or jetliner would be<br>
attacked in retaliation for the prosecution of the sheik, convicted of<br>
plotting to blow up major New York City landmarks.<br>
<p>
Investigators have been unable to find definitive evidence proving any<br>
of their three key theories: missile, bomb planted in the plane or a<br>
mechanical malfunction.<br>
<p>
On Friday, the bomb theory took another tumble when the FBI revealed<br>
the plane had carried explosives within a year of the crash as part of<br>
a training exercise for drug-sniffing dogs.<br>
<p>
That revelation could explain how traces of explosives were found on<br>
wreckage of the downed Boeing 747.<br>
<p>
The overriding obstacle for investigators probing the missile theory<br>
has been the fact that Flight 800's engines show no signs of missile<br>
damage.<br>
<p>
But military experts told the FBI several modern heat-&lt;JU&gt;seeking<br>
missiles -- in the hands of terrorists in Africa and available to<br>
their Middle East counterparts -- target a plane's "central mass."<br>
<p>
These missiles -- launched from a shoulder harness or a small pad --<br>
different from the Stinger missiles that Afgani freedom fighters used<br>
against the Russians -- are equipped with a super-sophisticated heat-<br>
seeking device and are able to reach higher targets.<br>
<p>
TWA 800 exploded at 13,700 feet -- the upper limit for the newest of<br>
these portable-type missile systems.<br>
<p>
Military experts pointed the FBI to man-portable missiles such as the<br>
SA -14 Gremlin, SA-16 Gimlet and SA-18 Grouse -- equipped with<br>
"proportional convergence logic" systems that are "sensitive enough to<br>
home in on airframe radiation" once it nears its target, rather than<br>
isolated hot spots.<br>
