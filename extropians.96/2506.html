<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; i don't understand.  are you saying that someone who "suffers material</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -banjo</i><br>
 What he said is someone who CHOOSES material privations is not<br>
suffering harm, as it is a freely chosen activity.  Someone who chooses<br>
to remain an alcoholic, risks giving up his or her property, families,<br>
and means of earning wealth, so to be homeless individual in order to<br>
remain  substance abuser, in spite of the efforts of any other person<br>
who cares about them, means voluntarily accepting ones suffering. THe<br>
state of the economy has not a damn thing to do with it. I know, I was<br>
there once.<br>
<p>
SOmeone who freely choses not to make the effort to obtain the education<br>
to earn a good living voluntarily accepts the associated suffering of<br>
living in poverty. I know, I was there once.<br>
<p>
THe HIGH poverty is a function of the amount of government subsidy for<br>
reproduction among those who freely choose to remain in poverty.<br>
<p>
The stuffed to everflowing penal system is a function of government<br>
attempting to limit the individuals right to freely chose to use<br>
substances which may harm them. Put them in jail instead, where they can<br>
get drugs even easier, and catch AIDS as well.<br>
<p>
Your Dale Carngie had it right. We are all free to chose wealth or<br>
poverty, to choose to be with the families that love us or live alone<br>
under bridges.<br>
