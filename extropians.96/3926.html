Eliezer, I think you're a fine fellow and if you have interpreted anything I  <br>
said as a personal attack I apologize, I assure you I did not intend it that  <br>
way. I think some people are a bit put off by your arrogance, but not me, <br>
I like arrogant people, I'm an arrogant bastard myself and it's always nice <br>
to talk to a fellow member of the brotherhood. I look at it this way, <br>
if I have superior knowledge or intelligence then I've earned the right to be <br>
arrogant, and if I've demonstrated exceptional stupidity or uncommon <br>
ignorance then my arrogance performs an altruistic service by generating <br>
amusement and mirth in all I come in contact with.<br>
                                            <br>

                <br>
<p>
Good, I'm glad you cleared that up.<br>
                 <br>

                 <br>
<p>
There is nothing more relevant. If it were proved that we can not be run on a <br>
Turing Machine then I would abandon my interest in Science and Mathematics <br>
and become a Holly Roller. It would be the only logical thing to do.<br>
                 <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;aware of how one's own cognitive architecture affects one's                 </i><br>

                 <br>
<p>
Not possible. We have only a hazy understanding of our motives and almost no <br>
understanding of out individual cognitive architecture. There is reason to <br>
think that this ignorance about ourselves will not improve dramatically <br>
regardless of how intelligent we become. You may be able to obtain a deep<br>
understanding of my mind, and I could do the same with you, but we will never <br>
understand ourselves.<br>
                 <br>
In 1935 Turing solved The Halting Problem, he proved that there is no general <br>
way to determine what a program will do other than run it and see. A program <br>
does not know what it will do next and to me that means it has free will. <br>
If your brain hardware was faster than mine you could form a mental model of  <br>
me, run it, and predict everything I would do. However you could not do the<br>
same thing with yourself. For the mind to totally understand itself it must <br>
form a perfect internal model of itself. The model must not only describe the <br>
rest of the mind in every detail but it must also depict the model itself <br>
with a micro model. This micro model must represent the rest of the brain and<br>
the micro model itself with a micro micro model. This path leads to an <br>
impossible infinite regress. Both the brain and the model must be made up of <br>
a finite number of elements. If we are not to lose accuracy the components of <br>
the brain must have a one to one correspondence with the elements of the <br>
model. But this is impossible because the brain as a whole must have more <br>
members than the part that is just the model. <br>
                 <br>
This argument does not hold if the mind has an infinite number of components, <br>
it is possible to have a one to one correspondence with a proper subset of an <br>
infinite set. From this I conclude that we have free will but God does not.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
In a different post on a different subject you indicated that you were <br>
certain that a Quantum Computer will be built in the next 15 years. I don't <br>
see how you can be so certain, I think there is a 30% chance, and only a 60% <br>
chance that such a machine would not violate the laws of Physics, this area <br>
is at the very frontier of knowledge. The rapid progress made in just the <br>
past year is very encouraging, particularly the work in Quantum Error <br>
Correction, but I think it would be overstating it to say that they have a <br>
proof of concept. I still think there is a 40% chance we'll have to settle <br>
for old fashioned Drexler style Nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
You also said you were certain that faster than light travel and <br>
Picotechnology was possible. Care to elaborate?<br>
