Ah, that tired old left-right dimension again. Let's get away from this<br>
one-dimensional view of political views. If you haven't seen the Nolan<br>
Chart, which makes progress by mapping views into two dimensions, I<br>
recommend taking a look. I believe there's a link to it somewhere on Eric<br>
Watt Forste's Extropians web site in one of the sections dealing with politics.<br>
<p>
Left vs. right is quite unhelpful, and those of us who are libertarian, or<br>
otherwise strongly and consistently individualist, do ourselves a disservice<br>
trying to place ourselves on that axis. "Left" used to mean the<br>
revolutionaries who sat on the left of the assembly during the time of the<br>
French Revolution. The "right" were the monarchists. Individualists have a<br>
quite different set of values, although we at least have in common with the<br>
old left the desire to change the existing order. However, most of us would<br>
not choose to use the slogan "liberty, equality, fraternity" since this has<br>
meant, in practice, freedom from choice, compulsory and fake equality, and<br>
forced fraternity.<br>
<p>
Since then, the terms "left" and "right" have mutated in meaning so much<br>
that they are worthless. When I was a libertarian student activist in<br>
England, "right" could mean (a) an old Tory conservative, protective of the<br>
existing order, not wanting to change much at all; (b) a fascist; (c) a<br>
mildly progressive conservative who wanted to slightly roll back government<br>
only in the social sphere; (c) a libertarian who wanted to vastly increase<br>
liberty in both economic and social spheres. <br>
<p>
Sometime libertarians got described as the "new right". (Due to one of my<br>
teenage essays for the Libertarian Alliance, a newspaper once described me a<br>
"the precocious guru of the New Right" -- a title that still makes me<br>
chuckle. They also called me a "morally deformed exhibitionist". Hmmm, maybe<br>
Nick Nicholas was a newspaper writer in England in those days....) But "New<br>
Right" was also used to refer to the very opposite of libertarian -- those<br>
who wanted the government to control all aspects of individuals' lives for<br>
the sake of the nation.<br>
