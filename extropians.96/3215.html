<i>&gt;Is caffine or nicotine a better nootropic?</i><br>
<p>
Caffeine (look it up), in my book.  Both are alkaloids, but nicotine is<br>
much more toxic and much more addictive.  One develops tolerance to both,<br>
though since I haven't tried nicotine I don't know how fast that one comes<br>
on.<br>
<p>
BTW, I'm assuming you're contemplating something like a patch.  Smoking<br>
speeds nicotine out of the realm of "unwise", passes through "entropic"<br>
without slowing down, and comes to rest somewhere downstream of "damned<br>
stupid".  That inteligence and will are largely unrelated is the only<br>
explanation I can find for those of my (undeniably intelligent) friends<br>
who haven't been able to beat that monkey off their backs yet.<br>
<p>
Personally, I tend to avoid caffeine except in cases of emergency, too<br>
(I narrowly avoided a chocolate-covered espresso bean habit), just<br>
because of the tolerance effect.  I want it to work when I need it.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, you might get more interesting answers from "What's a<br>
[legal, nonaddictive, powerful, fast-acting, nonprescription, cheap,<br>
whatever your constraints are] nootropic?".<br>
