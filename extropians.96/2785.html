<i>&gt; All my life, I have seen people having a great deal of trouble communicating</i><br>

<i>&gt; understand what they were asking or else think they were asking something</i><br>
<i>&gt; else, and so they would answer very inadequately, leaving the student baffled.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I understood exactly what my fellow students were asking, and I understood</i><br>
<i>&gt; how the teachers misinterpreted them.  I have seen miscommunication like this</i><br>
<i>&gt; all my life.  I often act as a mediator between people who are talking to each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other but can't understand each other, even though they are both fluent</i><br>
<i>&gt; speakers of English.  One person says something, and the other is baffled, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I restate it for them in better terms, and the person they are talking to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understands.  I'm often saying, "What he's trying to say is..."</i><br>

I know exactly how you feel. But don't assume that teachers are<br>
excellent communicators.  I'll have you know that here in the US, the<br>
average SAT score of teachers is the very lowest of ANY profession<br>
requiring a bachelors degree. There are very few teachers I have known<br>
that were in my mind capable communicators.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am actually a far better communicator than most humans.  Most humans have</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more trouble expressing things than I do.  My assumption is not in error.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Humans DO have a difficult time communicating with each other, except about</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain, limited topics.</i><br>
<p>
But you are still assuming that ALL humans are bad  communicators. It is<br>
more a matter of laziness and ignorance than lack of brain matter.<br>
