<i>&gt;Browsing Science News over my morning coffee, I found an encouraging report:</i><br>
<i>&gt;The old idea that memory impairment in older people results from the loss of</i><br>
<i>&gt;neurons in the hippocampus has been challenged by a couple of recent studies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Instead of looking at a thin slice of rat hippocampus, researchers counted</i><br>
<i>&gt;neurons in 3D pieces. They found no evidence that the older rats with memory</i><br>
<i>&gt;impairment had fewer neurons. Though this study needs to be done on human</i><br>
<i>&gt;hippocampuses, this gives reason to think that memory impairment results</i><br>
<i>&gt;from changes in function of neurons (making different proteins, etc.) rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;than in neuronal loss. That's good, because it should make preservation and</i><br>
<i>&gt;restoration of function easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I read the same article and got a different hit.  If memory loss results from <br>
subtle changes in neuronal function, then perhaps invisible and irreparable <br>
damage is done during cryonic suspension.  Furthermore, it is often<br>
 more difficult to prevent and/or correct subtle damage to cells and tissues <br>
than it is to prevent and/or correct gross damage or death.  Brain cells that <br>
look normal anatomically may not function normally and important i<br>
nformation (memories) may be lost. Thus, the report in Science News is not <br>
necessarily good news for cryonics.<br>
