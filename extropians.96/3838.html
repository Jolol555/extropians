<i>&gt;Sorry to be opaque, let me elaborate.  Your basic argument appears to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be that it is inevitable that "they" will be able to watch "us", but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we may be able now to choose whether we watch them.  Given your</i><br>
<i>&gt;assumptions, your anti-privacy answer is obvious -- of course, let us</i><br>
<i>&gt;watch them.  But what if you are dead wrong about your assumptions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;If it were inevitable that we could not watch them, but open to choice</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether they could watch us, the obvious choice would be pro-privacy</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- let them not watch us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Given that your assumptions about what is and isn't likely to be up</i><br>
<i>&gt;for grabs matter this much, you need to give explicit arguments to</i><br>
<i>&gt;defend these assumptions.  I'm not saying you're wrong - just undefended.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Again, please do not call me anti-privacy.<br>
<p>
Robin, you have a good grasp of logic, but sometimes need to be forced to<br>
express it well.  As you did this second time.<br>
<p>
Yes, that is a basic assumption of my argument.  I believe it is supported<br>
by history.<br>
<p>
No mass government in all of history has known as much about its people as<br>
ours does.  And no mass citizenry has ever been as free.  The obvious fact<br>
is that there is zero correlation between limiting the governments access<br>
to information and our freedom.<br>
<p>
There is an almost direct correlation, on the other hand, between freedom<br>
and our ability to deny government officials secrecy.  And that is<br>
precisely why we have pulled off this miracle.  Because every time the govt<br>
asked us for more info about us, We in turn notched up our requirements<br>
about how open THEY had to be.  It is astonishing how closely these trends<br>
have marched in almost perfect lockstep.<br>
<p>
Proof is in the rare exceptions.  Almost every time the govt has succeeded<br>
in making something secret, it has proven to be a disaster.  In the USSR,<br>
where secrecy was habitual, disasters abounded to a degree they'll be<br>
paying for generations from now.<br>
<p>
In fact, Robin, in your second scenario... if it is inevitable that we<br>
cannot watch them... it will not matter an iota whether we are all armed<br>
with PGP.  Aristos and bureaucrats will conspire together with impunity,<br>
and eventually crush us.  PGP is defeated pretty easily by a battering ram<br>
and armed storm troopers.  In your 2nd scenario, this renaissance is over,<br>
and our best option is not to defend it, but to be the first successful<br>
conspirators.<br>
