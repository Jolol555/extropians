          Eric Watt Forste suggests that the great filter is in the <br>
          step to advanced tool use. What about the objection that <br>
          this step was completed relatively _shortly_ after the <br>
          humanoid monkeys came into existance?<br>
          <br>
This is a strong objection, I think.   I've been researching it.<br>
<p>
Mammal brains have been growing somewhat steadily since all the dinos<br>
were killed off 65 mya, and dolphins brains as big as ours 15-20 mya.<br>
One might suggest that the hard step was a combination of getting<br>
whatever allows mammals to have big brains, plus some event to get the<br>
dinos out of the way.<br>
<p>
The problem with this theory is that birds also have brains as big as<br>
mammals, and seem to have evolved from dinos, with the latest common<br>
ancestor between mammals and birds being soon after land-eggs were<br>
invented 310mya (before which animal land colonization was stymied).<br>
<p>
So maybe the last hard step was the land-egg, or maybe the hard step<br>
was some special organization of mammal brains relative to bird brains.<br>
Is there an important different of organization here?<br>
