 Perhaps I am too fond of detail.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't know. I certainly care about details when I'm creating <br>
something. I'd rather _be_ Kant than _read_ Kant (that's figurative; <br>
I don't really want to be Kant). Perhaps I value direct experience <br>
too highly. YMMD=?Your Myers-Briggs May Differ. <br>
<p>
For me, _Flow_ didn't, but I respect what I think M. C. was trying to <br>
do. And, to recast Max's comment, it can be hard to publish something <br>
much shorter than a book and get it distributed like a book.. "Bestseller <br>
essay" is not yet a publishing category, unfortunately. There's also <br>
the "weigh the thesis" effect.<br>
<p>
Toffler's _Future Shock_, to pick another book, seemed to have about <br>
two decent chapters in it.<br>
<p>
Lakeoff's _Women, Fire and Dangerous Things (What Categories Reveal <br>
About the Mind)_, on the other hand, only bogged down for me in the <br>
appendices, where he takes on the opposition at agonizing length.<br>
<p>
And I think very highly of Edward de Bono's work, but there is a <br>
*lot* of overlap book-to-book and I consequently would rather teach <br>
CoRT and related technologies than tell people to go out and buy all <br>
his books.<br>
<p>
Which raises the question of Extropian reading circles. I'd form one; <br>
I'd join one; I might learn to appreciate aspects of authors I'd <br>
otherwise miss. Anyone doing that in Si Valley?<br>
