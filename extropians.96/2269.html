There is a big gray area here.  I am a microbiologist doing _engineering_ of<br>
water systems.  Yet, I started out in college minoring in _music_ and have<br>
played the trumpet, piano, cello, oboe, violin and recorder.  My father is an<br>
artist, yet he taught earth science for 30 years.  I studied _art_ under my<br>
father and still produce some art today.  Four years ago I seriously<br>
considered selling, at least part time, my _art_ for income (and decreasing<br>
microbiology).  But, I now own my own microbiology company.  <br>
<p>
Am I right brain dominant or left brain dominant?  Perhaps I'm not dominant<br>
in either side or more likely:  I switch back and forth.  In the book by<br>
Better Edwards,_Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_, shows how she can<br>
get left brain dominant thinkers to switch over to the right side of the<br>
brain when they draw.  The same person will produce strikingly different<br>
drawings depending on which _mode_ they are in as if TWO different people are<br>
inside one body.<br>
<p>
Ansel Adams said the engineering of photography was more important than in<br>
painting and yet I would hardly say Ansel Adams was not a artist.   <br>
<p>
I think I have learned to change between one dominance and the another, but I<br>
have both available.  Is it just that some people don't know how to switch<br>
back and forth?  Because that could give the wrong impression of a right vs.<br>
left brain battle that really isn't there.<br>
