Bill of No Rights<br>
By Lewis W. Napper<br>
 <br>
                      Bill of No Rights<br>
 <br>
We, the sensible of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get<br>
along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more riots, keep our<br>
nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the blessings of<br>
debt-free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great grandchildren,<br>
hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense<br>
guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt-ridden delusional, and other<br>
liberal, commie, pinko bedwetters.<br>
 <br>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that a whole lot of people were<br>
confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of<br>
No Rights.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to a new car, big-screen color TV or any other<br>
form of wealth.<br>
 <br>
More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is<br>
guaranteeing anything.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on<br>
freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may<br>
leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but<br>
the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a<br>
screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool<br>
manufacturer to make you and all of your relatives independently wealthy.<br>
<p>
You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the<br>
most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, <br>
but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation <br>
of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation <br>
of another generation of professional couch potatoes.<br>
<p>
You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but<br>
from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public<br>
health care.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap,<br>
rape, intentionally maim or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest<br>
of us get together and kill you.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob,cheat,<br>
or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised<br>
if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you<br>
still won't have the right to a big-screen color TV or a life of leisure.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in<br>
foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive<br>
governments and won't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if<br>
you'd like.  However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do<br>
not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little<br>
tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have one,<br>
and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take<br>
advantage of the opportunities in education and vocational training laid<br>
before you to make yourself useful.<br>
 <br>
You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you<br>
have the right to pursue happiness -- which, by the way, is a lot easier<br>
if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by<br>
those around you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.<br>
