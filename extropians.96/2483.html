Many Extropians and Transhumanists dream of transferring their consciousness <br>
onto a different substrate than the biological one they currently are running <br>
on.  Many want to have their brain simulated, atom-for-atom, by incredibly <br>
powerful computers and provide themselves with whatever sensory reality they <br>
desire.  They believe that being run on a computer will give them much more <br>
freedom to alter themselves and improve themselves, and they look forward to <br>
being able to have their realities be whatever they desire them to be.  This <br>
idea, called "Uploading" is as appealing to many Transhumanists and Extropians <br>
as the idea of Heaven is to Christians and other religious people.<br>
<p>
I have been thinking about uploading lately and what fundamental differences <br>
there would be to living in a computer versus living in the world of molecules <br>
and cells.  Since many people who want to be uploaded want their lives to be <br>
similar to the way they are now, there would not be much difference at all for <br>
them.  But would they die?  That is an important question to consider, since <br>
many people view uploading as a way to avoid dying.  Is the upload environment <br>
really a safe one?  The biological world is not, since there are many ways a <br>
person can become disintegrated and disorganized (also known as dying).  Can <br>
an upload be disintegrated?  Are there any guaranteed ways to avoid computer <br>
viruses in the upload environment that basically cause a person's <br>
consciousness to disintegrate?  I don't think so.  In my opinion, the upload <br>
environment will be as dangerous as the biological world and will be far from <br>
the paradise that many dreamers imagine it will be.  I see no reason why the <br>
upload environment will be free from predators.<br>
<p>
I actually consider this world that I find myself in to be an upload <br>
environment.  Since it is truly impossible to determine whether this world is <br>
being run on a computer or not, I see no reason to assume that it is not, <br>
especially since we are proposing that worlds as richly detailed as our own <br>
will be run on computers someday.  <br>
<p>
I like to think that we are living in a world of software; that atoms and <br>
molecules and cells and so forth are software modules, with various <br>
properties, interacting with other software modules.  My body / consciousness <br>
is one kind of software in this computer environment.  Unfortunately, this <br>
software has several properties which I would like to alter.  For one thing, <br>
it is fairly easy to disturb the software module that I am and cause me to <br>
disintegrate; I am a fragile being.  Also, these bodies tend to self-terminate <br>
after a while.  I don't see my situation as all that different from an upload, <br>
facing the dangers and limitations they will face.  As far as I can tell, I AM <br>
an upload already.  The world of physics is the computer that I am being run <br>
on.<br>
<p>
So, for me, the question is:  What can I do with the resources I have in <br>
WHATEVER environment I find myself in?  Currently, I find myself to be a <br>
biological being in a very complex sensory environment.  I have certain <br>
thinking and acting faculties, which I am learning how to use, by playing <br>
around with them and seeing what they can do.  I can change the shape of my <br>
body by contracting various muscles, and I can use this feature to alter my <br>
sensory environment in various ways, sometimes called "moving things around".  <br>
I can also use certain muscles and a fractal-like bag of air, to cause certain <br>
flaps of tissue to vibrate in various ways, which alter the part of my sensory <br>
environment called "hearing".  By vibrating my throat in different patterns, I <br>
seem to have some amount of control over certain other parts of my sensory <br>
environment called "other people".  I have other faculties also that I am <br>
discovering how to use to alter my sensory environment in various, desirable <br>
ways.<br>
<p>
That is how I operate.  I asess my current situation to discover what <br>
resources I have, and I play around with those resources to gain an <br>
understanding of what I can do with them, and then I use my available <br>
resources to make my current situation more the way I want it to be.  I am <br>
learning to make the most out of what I have.<br>
<p>
I find myself to have a biological brain, but I don't moan about it's <br>
limitations, like many Extropians and Transhumanists do.  Yes, there is much <br>
that my brain CAN'T do, but I'm busy finding out what it CAN do and making the <br>
most of that.  I don't think any of us here are using our brains to anywhere <br>
even close to their full capacity.<br>
<p>
This is the challenge I have given to myself: to operate at my highest <br>
capacity; to make the most of what I have; to find out what I'm truly capable <br>
of.  It may be that I have some fundamental limitations, but I'm wanting to <br>
advance myself right up to those limitations, to push myself to my limits, and <br>
then hopefully find a way to surpass those limits.<br>
<p>
I am very optimistic about what my brain is capable of.  I think it's possible <br>
for me, and for nearly all humans, to surpass the brilliant genius of Mozart, <br>
of Einstein, of daVinci, of all past and current geniuses.  The geniuses show <br>
us some of what the biological brain is capable of, but I like to believe that <br>
even they weren't anywhere close to using their full capabilities.<br>
<p>
I ask myself:  What am I cabable of?  <br>
<p>
My life will be my answer.<br>
