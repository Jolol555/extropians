<i>&gt; &gt; of this seems to be a highly active imagination so when I had Tourette</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; panic attacks when I was a kid it was due alot of times to their telling me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of demons and satan and when I finally fought back the religious crap I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; realized a greater sense of reality as opposed to the more imaginary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; metaphysical religious world I viewed previously and had far fewer panic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; attacks. I also think it was due to puberty setting on that my Tourettes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; faded but I also think atheism played an integral part. Could it be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tramatic and damaging for some kids to be exposed to religion?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is rather unfortunate. I fortunately had some rather rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents, both technically degreed, who practiced partly from family</i><br>
<i>&gt; tradition, and a need for a solid moral upbringing for their kids. One</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing I would be adamant about defining two different types of religious</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior: The difference between religious theology or theosophy, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious mythology. The former in my opinion tends to have a bit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropic potential, while the latter is highly entropic. Seems like</i><br>
<i>&gt; you've been tortured by quite a bit of mythic superstition. I've seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; both types of behaviors by people in the church I was raised in, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idiocy of the mythic superstionists made me not wish to continue formal</i><br>
<i>&gt; practicing. Rather, I tend to live a proactive life under the guise of:</i><br>
<i>&gt; " "God" helps those who help themselves". I also, unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt; supertstitionists, have no idea of the location or nature of whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; caused our universe to come into existence, so rather than atheist, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to be agnostic. I have no convictions either way, and demand proof</i><br>
<i>&gt; of both sides, religious or atheist for their postion. My mother for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example considers herself a Catholic Agnostic, if you can believe it!</i><br>
