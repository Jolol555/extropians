<i>&gt;Chris, the visual language is already being used, and it's been around in</i><br>
many <br>
<i>&gt;forms for thousands of years.  It's not something that we have to invent and </i><br>
<i>&gt;standardize.  Look at a magazine advertisement.  Watch television.  Go to</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;movies.  Go to an art gallery.  These are forms of the visual language.  If </i><br>
<i>&gt;you wish to communicate with a visual language, develop your skills in</i><br>
graphic <br>
<i>&gt;arts.  Learn to create images.</i><br>
<p>
A pictures' worth a thousand words. Hmm good analogy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So many tools are being developed now that make it much easier for people to </i><br>
<i>&gt;create very high quality images and communicate them with others, that </i><br>
<i>&gt;creating images is likely to eventually become as popular as making sounds.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;People will then communicate much more through images than they do now.  But </i><br>
<i>&gt;we will still use sound, I'm sure.  We will use words still, I'm sure.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;However, tools are also being developed that allow people to generate very </i><br>
<i>&gt;high quality sounds.  New sorts of musical instruments are being created</i><br>
that <br>
<i>&gt;will be very powerful and versatile.  People will be able to play these </i><br>
<i>&gt;instruments with data gloves, worn on their hands and connected to small, </i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful computers.  Creating music is likely to become as popular as</i><br>
speaking <br>
<i>&gt;is today.  People will grow competent at expressing their own emotions</i><br>
through <br>
<i>&gt;the music they will be generating pretty much all the time.</i><br>
<p>
We'll be able to create all sorts of new instruments and sounds by 3D<br>
modeling them and simulating air or vibrations passing through them to<br>
create strange unique sounds.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I might create an image around us of an open meadow, and you might create </i><br>
<i>&gt;flowers and trees which blossom around us.  Someone else could join in, </i><br>
<i>&gt;creating a soft and beautiful melody, slowly rising and filling the air as </i><br>
<i>&gt;someone makes the sun rise and adds clouds to glow with glorious color.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Someone else will contribute, with a clam deep voice, saying softly, "We</i><br>
wake <br>
<i>&gt;to a new day, a day of promise, a day where we will create the fulfullment</i><br>
of <br>
<i>&gt;all our deepest desires."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our dialogue would be a shared art project, each of us playing with and</i><br>
adding <br>
<i>&gt;to the contributions of the others.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, this sound possible in a virtual environment and we'll probably see<br>
something like this no to long from now.<br>
