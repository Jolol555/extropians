<i>&gt;  power is being shifted by the rules.</i><br>
<p>
I don't disagree.  First, note that I wrote that legal "structures" regarding<br>
evidence are complex, not the rules themselves.  In fact, most evidence rules<br>
themselves can be stated in fairly simple terms.  By and large, it is the<br>
interaction of the rules with each other and with other elements of the legal<br>
"system" that creates complex evidence "structures."<br>
<p>
In fact, a pattern of "complexification" occurs over time in any common law<br>
(or legislative) structure.  A simple rule is annunciated to deal with a<br>
specific case.  Application of that rule conflicts with the application of<br>
some other rule in another case.  A "meta-rule" (usually made with reference<br>
to some third rule) is developed to resolve the conflict.  Contradictions in<br>
application of the meta-rule then spawn yet further "meta-rules" in<br>
subsequent cases.  Programmers and other system designers will recognize this<br>
pattern.  <br>
<p>
Eventually, once sufficient contradiction and "overcomplexification" occurs,<br>
someone develops a whole new analytical framework that throws out much of the<br>
previous rule-structure in favor of a new, simpler rule structure.  A good<br>
example is the way in which the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code threw<br>
out the absurd complexity that had developed in the contract law of "offer<br>
and acceptance" in favor of a completely new and simpler scheme (fresh on my<br>
mind from a case I'm currently working on).<br>
<p>
Of course, throwing out old legal structures in favor of new ones has a price<br>
in terms of lost precedential authority and a lack of predictive certainty<br>
with reference to the new rules.  Accordingly, good jurists don't take the<br>
"new paradigm" route of simplification often or apply it to large parts of a<br>
legal system at once.  Thus, at any one time some areas of the law will be<br>
relatively "simple" (having had the thick undergrowth of "meta-rules"<br>
recently cleared out) and others will be "complex" (requiring carefully<br>
picking one's way through the vines ...).<br>
<p>
And thus my comment about unavoidable complexity ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   A simple rule that would be more effective at avoiding absurd delays</i><br>
<i>&gt;  would be to have the loser pay the costs of the winning side and of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  court system. If that isn't enough, we could add a time limit that keeps</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the trial time from exceeding a specified fraction of the prison time at</i><br>
<i>&gt;  risk or the trial costs from exceeding a specified fraction of the money</i><br>
<i>&gt;  at stake.</i><br>
<p>
Both suggestions have merit.  FYI, your first suggestion is known in the U.S.<br>
as "the English Rule", for obvious reasons.  In fact, it does have the result<br>
of discouraging litigation in the UK.  Many folks in the UK are trying to<br>
change the rule because of perceived inequities for small claimants.  In the<br>
U.S., the idea tends to be favored by "big business", since they already<br>
often pay the winner's costs when they lose through contingency fees and the<br>
tendency of juries to make large awards against their interests<br>
"overcompensating" those who prevail against them, or so they say.<br>
<p>
I've never encountered your second suggestion before.  Obviously the<br>
correlation between trial or other "process" time and amount in controversy<br>
would have to be other than linear.  Beyond that observation, I think it is<br>
something well worth exploring.<br>
