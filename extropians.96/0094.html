Certainly history in and of itself doesn't do much to supply us with<br>
theoretical structures. Theory is a completely different issue. I'll take<br>
good theory from whereever I happen to find it.<br>
<p>
The thing that really sucks about history is that there's never a control<br>
group. But history is still an incredibly rich source of data about<br>
structures that are too large to study in a laboratory, and, because they<br>
involve human beings who sometimes messily and unpredictably invent new<br>
theories to guide their own actions, too complex to simulate. If laboratory<br>
data and simulation data conflict with historical data, my own cautious<br>
preferences lead me to side with the historical data. If a computer<br>
simulation or a laboratory experiment were to lead to a conclusion that<br>
Diocletian's policies would lead to a thriving and wealthy Roman empire, or<br>
that Stalin's policies would lead to a thriving and wealthy Soviet Union,<br>
I'd be *inclined* to discount the laboratory/simulation data on that basis<br>
alone. Before I read Hayek I was a lot more cavalier about these things.<br>
