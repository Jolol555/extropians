I dunno... I never claimed to be an extropian. Embryonic transhuman, yes, <br>
but not extropian. (I still don't know too exactly what extropian is <br>
supposed to be).<br>

But that's what physics and extrapolation says. You can't lick Malthus, <br>
nor exponential growth in a limited universe, not on the really long run.<br>

Within physical limits, yes.<br>

Uh, I don't think we can ignore physics. We certainly haven't got the <br>
whole picture, and we can certainly expect further knowledge breakthroughs.<br>
But we must play to the rules of the game, even if we do not know all the <br>
rules yet.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;From a scientific point of view (which happens to be my view), we have to </i><br>
work with what we know. The emergency exit route of spacetime engineering <br>
may well be forbidden, may be closed to us. What is left then is certainly <br>
breathtaking, but it is also certainly limited.<br>
