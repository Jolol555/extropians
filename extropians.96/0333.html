          What do you mean? If there are only finitely many states, <br>
          you would sooner or later either come back to an earlier <br>
          state or reach a stasis. So you mean that the bound is not <br>
          on the number of states?<br>
          <br>
          (Off topic: This has an associative connection to the claim <br>
          made by Anders a couple of weeks ago (Re:The Dividing <br>
          Neuron), and recently cited by Crosby_M, that there is no <br>
          correlation between intelligence and the number of neurons <br>
          in the brain. That is almost certainly false. I have seen <br>
          estimates ranging from .1 to .3 for the correlation between <br>
          human head size and IQ. Brain weight correlates even <br>
          stronger. It therefore seems reasonable to suppose that <br>
          #neurons also correlates significantly with IQ. My guess is <br>
          that if one would count the neurons in the different areas <br>
          of the brain and weigh these numbers with those areas' <br>
          contribution to general intelligence, one would come up with <br>
          a correlation coefficient of at least .3 or .4.)<br>
