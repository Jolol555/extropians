From: Lyle Burkhead[SMTP:LYBRHED@delphi.com]<br>
Wednesday, November 27, 1996 2:19 AM:<br>
&lt;So we arrive back at the Great Filter problem.  The dinosaurs lived on <br>
earth for millions of years, but never evolved into tool-using creatures. <br>
 Why?<br>
Terence McKenna has suggested that when our ancestors discovered <br>
psychedelic mushrooms, that stimulated them to start thinking, talking, and <br>
using tools.  That was when they broke through the filter and started <br>
making progress.  Without mushrooms, we could have been stuck in an <br>
evolutionary cul de sac for eons, like the dinosaurs.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't doubt that mushrooms and other natural nootropics helped; but, they <br>
were would have been freely available to other creatures at the time. <br>
However, I have heard that these mushrooms thrive in cow dung, and humans <br>
certainly learned how to herd cows so that they might have had a monopoly <br>
of the best mushroom supplies. Some species of insects, however, herd other <br>
insects, and also use fungi as foodstuffs, or make honey (and perhaps other <br>
psychotropic elixirs we are yet unaware of).  Why wouldn't having these <br>
similar 'self-owned' resources, and the cyberorganization that cultivating <br>
them brings, have raised their consciousness as well?  Anyway, I suspect <br>
that any _Great Filter_ would likely be a complex mix of factors, rather <br>
than having one 'magical' ingredient.  No matter how self-directed a <br>
creature becomes, it is still part of some larger system of resources and <br>
restraints, and must adapt to that as well.<br>
