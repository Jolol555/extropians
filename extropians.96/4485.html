<i>&gt;&gt; As would be his right until the moment he actually commits a crime that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; violates another's individual rights. Guns don't kill people, people</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; kill people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How come then that you in the states have twice the amount of gunshot</i><br>
<i>&gt;killings, then we do here in Denmark where privately owned guns are</i><br>
<i>&gt;illegal?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It's a more complicated issue than statistics.  Although, I agree that gun<br>
ownership does not generally have much help in a civilized country, I also<br>
believe that they don't hinder civilized development either.<br>
<p>
A major difference between the US and Denmark (for example) is that the<br>
ethnic and cultural dynamics (and diversity) of the US are considerably more<br>
pronounced than in Denmark.  An example local to where I live is the<br>
Vietnamese immigrant community.  Vietnamese are getting murdered here on a<br>
regular basis.  The thing is, they keep the killing completely within their<br>
community, and a lot of it comes over here from Vietnam, where presumably it<br>
is fairly common for people to be killed.  Most of my Vietnamese friends<br>
have seen other Vietnamese get murdered, it is so common.  Most murders in<br>
this country are generally committed within a persons own ethnic group.  And<br>
some select ethnic and cultural groups are more prone to killing than<br>
others, significantly skewing the murder rates.  When I lived in Nebraska,<br>
*no one* was ever murdered.  It just didn't happen.  But then again, you had<br>
an almost perfectly homogenous society in Nebraska (eastern European, mostly<br>
Czech), yet *everyone* owned guns.    <br>
<p>
<p>
I would suppose that the Danish culture just isn't as prone to having people<br>
kill each other, as some cultures in the US are.  But at the same time, I<br>
would submit that Europe in general has some problems that we don't have<br>
here in the US.  I knew a guy in college that worked for two years in an<br>
anti-terrorist unit in Germany.  In his short career, he was shot twice, and<br>
had shot and killed more militant political types than he could count.  Many<br>
of the times he shot people he was on duty as a bodyguard for various<br>
political figures.  He saw so much killing that he finally got sick of it<br>
and quit.  <br>
<p>
This type of thing is not common in the US.  Terrorism, although present, is<br>
not  particularly common in this country.  And assassination attempts are<br>
fairly rare.  In germany, he was instructed to shoot-to-kill, and he did.<br>
The way he described it, many of his anti-terrorist activities where<br>
state-sponsored executions of militant political dissidents.<br>
<p>
These statistics don't show up in murder rates, but the people he killed<br>
definitely had intent to commit murder (often with guns).  The difference<br>
is, the Germans were more willing to use lethal force to preempt the murder<br>
attempts and to squash militant political activity than in the US.<br>
<p>
I think that murder rates have less to due with gun ownership issues than<br>
with cultural, ethnic, and political issues.  *Accidental* deaths due to<br>
guns is a whole other story though...<br>
