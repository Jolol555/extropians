I am forwarding James Rogers' post to me, with his permission:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can give you more information than you probably want to know.  I will give</i><br>
<i>&gt;you a general breakdown of their products, market presence, management, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;future directions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) HARDWARE PRODUCTS:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pros:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The primary product of Sun Microsystems is the Sparc series workstations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;These workstations are *very* popular and make up the majority of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;workstation market.  Over 50% of hosts on the Internet are Sparc-based.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Solaris (the OS on Sparcstations) has very strong network capabilities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cons:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun Microsystems has had difficulty maintaining the performance of the Sparc</i><br>
<i>&gt;architecture.  Among the workstation vendors, the Sparc series processors</i><br>
<i>&gt;are by far the slowest and weakest.  This is a trend that they do not show</i><br>
<i>&gt;any signs of reversing.  In fact, Sparc is becoming one of the weakest</i><br>
<i>&gt;architectures in any processor market.  Example:  The top-of-the-line Sun</i><br>
<i>&gt;CPU is the Ultrasparc-1 running at 170MHz and has a system price starting at</i><br>
<i>&gt;$20k.  The top-of-the-line Intel CPU is the P6 running at 200MHz and has a</i><br>
<i>&gt;workstation price of $5k.  The performance of these two systems is virtually</i><br>
<i>&gt;identical.  There is an emerging trend where companies are moving from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional workstation hardware to the increasingly powerful Intel-based</i><br>
<i>&gt;and PowerPC-based workstations at a fraction of the cost.  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;significant evidence that "consumer" architectures such as Intel and PowerPC</i><br>
<i>&gt;will significantly surpass Sparc performance within two years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2) SOFTWARE PRODUCTS:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pros:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun Microsystems has several excellent software products, most notably </i><br>
<i>&gt;Solaris 2.5 and the Java related software.  Solaris will remain a popular</i><br>
<i>&gt;commercial OS as long as SparcStations are being produced, and is generally</i><br>
<i>&gt;considered to be a very good OS.  Sun's ownership of the Java environment is</i><br>
<i>&gt;an excellent position, strategically.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cons:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Although Solaris has been ported to other platforms, it is generally only</i><br>
<i>&gt;popular on the Sparc architecture.  As mentioned above, the decline of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sparc architecture will be followed by a parallel decline in the Solaris</i><br>
market.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3) PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Java hardware:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun is developing processors that will run Java bytecodes natively.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt;available, these processors will most likely be very popular for embedded</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems, smart terminals, and Internet appliances.  Properly managed, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;product could be extremely profitable for Sun Microsystems in the long term.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4) MARKET PRESENCE:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun Microsystems has enormous market presence.  This alone has driven the</i><br>
<i>&gt;high sales volume of their workstations.  This market presence is also what</i><br>
<i>&gt;allowed them to push Java on to the market.  Their two most valuable assets</i><br>
<i>&gt;right now is their market presence and Java.  Without these, they would not</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a long-term future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;5) MANAGEMENT:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun Microsystems has significant management problems.  They have</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficulties meeting release deadlines.  Workstation orders are routinely</i><br>
<i>&gt;delayed due to insufficient parts and a lack of parts suppliers.  They are</i><br>
<i>&gt;pretty famous for being late on their obligations.  They are also very</i><br>
<i>&gt;liberal with their spending.  They piss away money in enormous quantities</i><br>
<i>&gt;with little accountability.  A lot of people have made a lot of money off of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun Microsystems by charging them absurd amounts for parts and services.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They are to the Silicon Valley what the Department of Defense was to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;defense industry in the '80s;  an enormous source of free money.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;6) THE FUTURE OF SUN:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Currently, Sun has enormous growth and profitability, although more by</i><br>
<i>&gt;market forces than anything.  The entire future of Sun rests on the future</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Java.  Fortunately for Sun, they own the rights to a significant</i><br>
<i>&gt;percentage of Java-related technologies, and have many willing licensees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The development of Java-native hardware will also give Sun a dominant</i><br>
<i>&gt;position in the future of Java related technologies.  If they are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;successful in pushing their position in the Java market, their market value</i><br>
<i>&gt;will erode significantly over the next few years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bottom line:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Odds are better than even that Sun will remain profitable for the long-term,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that they will show strong growth for the short-term.  Their long-term</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth is questionable however, since the growing Java market may be offset</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the long-term by a declining workstation market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
