<i>&gt;&gt; Using</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Mars as an example, the latest word is that a Martian meteroite tested</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; by British scientists which is only 600,000 years old has the same life</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; traces as the 15 million year old rock publicized earlier. This second</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; rock is from a period of maritan history when the environment was pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; much the same as it is right now, leading to the high possibility that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there are still such organisms in volvanic vents and under the crust of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Mars.</i><br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be neat if we are able to extract any genetic information about<br>
these organisms to recreate them? I wonder what the consequences of them<br>
entering into the environment would be. Probably not much due to the fact<br>
that we have bigger badder organisms here ready to take them out. Disaster<br>
is even less probable if Earth life rode a rock from Mars to get here<br>
because then it would be more compatable to be killed off by earth life.<br>
