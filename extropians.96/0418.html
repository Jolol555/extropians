<i>&gt;  &gt; Sex is just one of those difficult issues: no matter what stance you </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; adopt toward it, you're sure to offend someone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In that case, we should be busy developing new memes rapidly as possible -</i><br>
<i>&gt; but honestly has anyone here ever gotten offended by discussing sex? I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine that is really true. Raise your hand if you find tallking about it</i><br>
<i>&gt; offensive.</i><br>
<p>
I think the only (and unintended at that) offense you might raise is that <br>
of keeping (potentially embryonic &gt;H) people from discussing more technical <br>
questions. Our mental resources ain't that plentiful to allow us <br>
squandering 'em. I am quite astonished as to the low percentile <br>
transhumanist technology discussion scores in the extropians mailing list. <br>
I know these things are highly nonlinear in time, yet it still unsettles me <br>
somewhat...<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; I observe that, like emotions, people will tend to view Sex as noncognitive,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or "not an issue" with brain developement ( strange because most primates I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know spend a high perecentage of their brain energy trying to find it or</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking about it) - A friend of mine returned from a week long conference on</i><br>
<p>
There is nothing strange about this obsession with sex: all organisms are <br>
evolutionary artefacted. No mate, no copulation, no offspring. The higher <br>
the organization stage, the longer the childhood, the longer the need for <br>
offspring protection. Hence a means to constructively bind two otherwise <br>
highly incooperative organisms to each other is required. (Admittedly, in <br>
some higher primates (bonobos?) sex has become a means of social <br>
organisation at clan scale, but this does not render the main argument <br>
meaningless).<br>
<p>
In fact, the hardwired "propagate, propagate, propagate" programme does <br>
often inhibit other functions, in humans mostly ratio. An (otherwise <br>
quite boring) physical act aquires a certain glorious aura, this also <br>
happens to the perception of mate/offspring. Remember the last endorphin <br>
high you rode when enamoured? Peek-a-boo -- ain't that one cute little <br>
dude?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; consciousness and cognition and I asked about the topic, what people said</i><br>
<i>&gt; about sex  and what the latest developements were in this arena - I laughed</i><br>
<i>&gt; as it dawned on us that there was not one lecture or booth or comment on it -</i><br>
<i>&gt; apparently this function of the brain is to "low brow" to explore! It was</i><br>
<p>
The function itself is certainly ancient. Bacteria fuck (E.coli S+/-), <br>
polypes copulate, insects do it, too. The only thing of interest sex has <br>
to it is the highly selective methods the evolutionary older brain <br>
regions utilizes to manipulate the younger reagions. Neat trick, that. <br>
This topics is interesting indeed, and should not be banned. Importance <br>
of supressed olfactory data (MHC fragments) to mate selection &amp; the <br>
influence of oral contraceptiva upon it. Heard about that one? Neato.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; deleted(or avoided) by the whole contingency. Same with most intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; forums  including this list- since i have been on board - til lately. I had</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen PLEASURE 101 on the mail list  and mistaken it for a thread on &gt;H memes</i><br>
<i>&gt; about sex.. but when i opened the files-  it was endless equations about A</i><br>
<i>&gt; not A! What a surprise! math equating &gt;H pleasure - now *that* is integrity</i><br>
<i>&gt; to higher functions of mind/brain.  haha !</i><br>
<p>
As Anders has once said: why not wiring the reward centre to some other, <br>
constructive tasks? I hope I am not preaching askesis here, but devoting <br>
an unnecessary amount of bandwidth + giving the subject much too much <br>
glamour (highest bandwidth communication? Only as mb/s transfer rate <br>
is involved. The same 4 mbases every time, with negligeable alterations. <br>
Boooring.)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;     Sarah had some really interesting ( but not too racey) views on &gt;H</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexuality but then we dropped the thread! But cheers to her for doing it! </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh well - guess it's one of those  "primate functions " of the body - and we</i><br>
<i>&gt; will evolve out of it anyway - </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm - I hope not! : (</i><br>
<p>
Replication in a limited environment (solid state mind ecosphere) is <br>
bound to be limited (orelse we have to contemplate upon admitting the <br>
Reaper in again, which imo is a Bad Idea), and, if not de novo would <br>
create a chimaeric structure from several contributors. You can wire your <br>
reward centre to it, but why bothering?<br>
