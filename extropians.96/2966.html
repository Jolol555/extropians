If the U.S. Navy routinely conducts missile tests in or sufficiently near<br>
the direct flight paths of commercial airliners, and the safety of the<br>
airlines depends solely on someone in the Navy picking up the phone and<br>
talking to someone at the FAA, then I would certainly admit this could have<br>
happened.<br>
<p>
However, I would like to see some credible evidence that this is how it is<br>
done.  While Navy documents are not generally made public, I believe FAA<br>
documents are.<br>
<p>
Finally, I would think there would be no one more anxious to exonerate TWA<br>
than TWA.  (The aircraft manufacturer -- was it Boeing? -- would be a close<br>
second.)  Has TWA commented on this theory?  Wouldn't they know whether<br>
Navy missile tests sometimes take place in this area?  Would they have a<br>
reason to cover-up a mistake made by the Navy -- a mistake that caused<br>
great harm to their business?<br>
<p>
Do you believe TWA is part of the conspiracy?  If not, I am willing to call<br>
their media relations department next week and see what they say.<br>
<p>
No hard feelings at this end, Ian.  I really don't think I have been<br>
attacking you; that has certainly never been my intent.<br>
<p>
Even if I do sometimes ridicule the idea that A = -A (which I do), remember<br>
I am ridiculing an *idea*.<br>
