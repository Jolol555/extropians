Just when I was getting comfortable being an atheist, the God Meme strikes <br>
again!  This time as a mutated, more robust infection.<br>
<p>
I can't remember exactly the strange and twisted path my mind was wandering, <br>
but somewhere along the way I was considering the universe as a whole and <br>
existence as such, and I was thinking about the Singularity and what types of <br>
activities those awesomely powerful beings would engage in.  It seems like <br>
creating universes and manipulating space-time itself may be child's play for <br>
such powerful beings.  Then came up the notion, which I've heard discussed <br>
before, that our universe may have been created by a physicist/hacker from <br>
some other universe.  So, the question was, and still is, was our universe <br>
created by a conscious being?  Is there some awesomely powerful being creating <br>
endless varieties of universes, tweaking with the parameters and seeing what <br>
happens?  Perhaps some of these universes develop in very interesting ways to <br>
this being, and they receive a great deal of attention.  Perhaps there are <br>
certain qualities that the being is looking for and hoping to take advantage <br>
of, such as intelligence and creativity.  Perhaps as life and intelligence <br>
begin developing in a universe, the being influences the universe, to <br>
encourage that development and help it flourish.<br>
<p>
Now I'm noticing the deep similarities to my wandering thoughts and many of <br>
the ideas in religions.  Perhaps there is a God who created this universe and <br>
helped encourage the development of life and continues to nourish the growth <br>
of greater intelligence in this universe.  When I look at this idea in light <br>
of the ideas I thought of earlier, it does not seem so silly.  I'm not <br>
thinking that a lot of the patently absurd ideas that the religions also teach <br>
may be accurate, but maybe the religions are right about a few things...  <br>
<p>
Perhaps it is possible for sufficiently intelligent beings in our universe <br>
(such as humans) to communicate with this highly advanced being, who created <br>
the universe, and receive some sort of assistance.  Perhaps this god has been <br>
busily forming methods of communicating with the intelligent creatures it <br>
helped develop in its experimental universe.  Perhaps certain states of mind <br>
facilitate communication with "God".<br>
<p>
These are all very big maybies, and I have no evidence for or against the God <br>
Theory or even any reason why it would be useful to explain any phenomenon, <br>
except possibly for the fact of our existence itself.  If there is a God, <br>
perhaps It will provide some useful and clear evidence.  Or perhaps we are <br>
incapable of understanding such things until post-Singularity?  Perhaps God's <br>
main goal right now is to help us advance to the post-Singularity state, so <br>
there can be some sort of meaningful dialogue between us and God.  God <br>
probably doesn't care whether we believe in God or not, just that we are <br>
making ourselves more intelligent and creative, so we will be more useful in <br>
God's enormous system which has entire universes as components.  And perhaps <br>
God is also in some other GOD's system of universes....  The Ultimate Fractal<br>
<p>
Just something to think about.<br>
