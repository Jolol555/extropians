          If you like you could say that counsciousness is caused by <br>
          the NRT and the reticular activation system in general as it <br>
          regulates the activity level in the other parts of the brain <br>
          (of course, there would be no counsciousness if those other <br>
          parts were absent).<br>

          I think the correlation between dreaming and having a <br>
          certain general activity level and EEG frequency in the <br>
          brain is strong but imperfect. Is your idea that the missing <br>
          part of the correlation could perhaps be found if we try to <br>
          correlate the activity level of specific brain structures <br>
          and sub-regions to reports of dreaming?<br>
