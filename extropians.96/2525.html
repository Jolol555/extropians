<i>&gt; I'd say that "commerce is the minimum level of civility with which</i><br>
<i>&gt; we can, or ought hope to, hold as a standard for dealing with strangers".</i><br>
<i>&gt; Courteous commerce, not commerce shoved down anyone's throat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And that's sometimes a blurry thing, unfortunately (see below).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But we're told the Phoenicians managed it, without even knowing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; languages of the people they traded with (in some cases, at least).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The source of that civility may be anything, including especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; compassion. For example, the Rotarians, corny as they may seem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What an utter stranger needs to know most, however, is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; "does this unknown person want me to have a wonderful life?" but rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; "will this person rip me off, or kill me, or enslave me?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or to quote Einstein (possibly apocryphally), "The most important</i><br>
<i>&gt; question a person can ask is: 'Is the universe a friendly place?'".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There's friendly-like-Mom-&amp;-Dad, and there's friendly-like-the-nice-</i><br>
<i>&gt; man-behind-the-candy-counter, and there's friendly-like-the-crack-</i><br>
<i>&gt; dealer-down-the-block. Are they interchangeable? Not really. (1) may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be better than (2), but (2) is better than (3). I think. And these</i><br>
<i>&gt; are all generalizations, anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ob Extropian comment, re: "what is enlightenment":</i><br>
<i>&gt; I see the H. accelerans speed-mismatch issue as being one that</i><br>
<i>&gt; could result in considerable trouble and potential mistrust.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Consider how irritated some people get when they're stuck in</i><br>
<i>&gt; traffic after just a couple coffees. Now scale that by two orders</i><br>
<i>&gt; of magnitude. How pissed-off can someone get in a subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; half-hour, waiting for the non-accelerated human in front to</i><br>
<i>&gt; notice the light has been green for 18 whole objective seconds?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And how tempted to do something impolite and self-serving?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps enlightenment is that set of qualities that will keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; accelerated humans from doing such, even when sorely tempted...?</i><br>

SOme very good points. I know I get ticked off enough at the idiots in<br>
this world, and I've only got a measly 160 IQ points, with a rather<br>
sedate metabolic rate. Imagine a &gt;H person at 1600 IQ and a speed of 500<br>
MHz, 500 or so teraflops, etc. putting up with your average moron. I<br>
suspect that there will have to be quite a bit of programming going on<br>
to develop temper moderation.  Although I suspect that the first option<br>
is total emotional emasculation, just to keep Omegaman from swatting the<br>
human fly in frustration.<br>
