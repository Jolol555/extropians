<i>&gt; So lets convince hotwired to put up one last post to notify users that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion is to be continued on alt.extropians. The public exploitation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropian principles should be used to spread the memes due to it being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; VERY SUCCESSFUL strategy which has been used quite successfully by the great</i><br>
<i>&gt; religions of the world as "Witnessing" but extropians aren't NEARLY as</i><br>
<i>&gt; annoying and allow people to come to them rather then them coming to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people. If we study memes and copy their replication patterns and methods,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the rationality and logic extropians profess, we may under 5 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; annihalate religion from the face of the planet!!</i><br>
<p>
You are kidding, aren't you?  5 years?<br>
<p>
Besides which, seen from my own extropian perspective, it's<br>
unnecessarily bellicose to talk of annihilation of competing<br>
memesets.  Better to speak of ours "outcompeting" theirs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have also seen great</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in the IRC channels expecially among the technically-minded.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- End of quoted excerpt from Chris Hind</i><br>
<p>
Even the "technically-minded" on the IRC channels have the<br>
attention span of goldfish.  Sorry, this is just a reaction to<br>
my experience on the HotWired Chat today, where I logged in<br>
expecting high-quality interaction related to the More/Borsook<br>
debate, and instead saw 'wannafuck?' messages aimed at the<br>
few women in the room.<br>

Grumble.<br>
