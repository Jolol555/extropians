Yep, you caught me.  I should have said 'the only *books* I've been <br>
reading lately are science books'.  I've also been reading this mailing <br>
list.  I guess I mistakenly assumed this was self-evident.  These <br>
'reasons for believeing that cover-ups exist' have been getting posted <br>
here quite regularly, and so of course I am now rather familiar with them.<br>
