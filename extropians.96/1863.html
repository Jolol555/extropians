As the one who first wrote "Greg Burch used this signature" (which<br>
Kathryn quoted), I'm sorry so much hostility was generated.  I think<br>
Shaun was probably wondering, as I was, how a thread about "The<br>
Conscious Mind" had turned into a thread about 'eagles &amp; parrots'.<br>
Though I was hoping for a different sort of discussion on that thread, I<br>
didn't really mind and found it amusing to see how it developed (until<br>
the hostility surfaced).<br>
<p>
On Saturday, October 12, 1996 9:24AM  Greg tried to clear the air with<br>
his META on Sense &amp; Sociability.  I agree with him that the list should<br>
be able to serve as "a social center for extropians".<br>
Maybe next time, though, we can all be more careful which threads we<br>
chose to do this on.<br>
