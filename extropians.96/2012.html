<i>&gt; Ever notice that when somebody talks about what is fair, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it always just happens to be to the personal advantage of the speaker. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Quite a coincidence.  I'll bet a baseball player has never </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the history of the world complained to the umpire </i><br>
<i>&gt; "You must be blind!  It's not fair, I was clearly out </i><br>
<i>&gt; at home base, yet you said I was safe and that we won </i><br>
<i>&gt; the game, you're giving our team an unfair advantage. </i><br>
<i>&gt; We should louse. Your call was grossly unfair you bum! ". </i><br>

In  1969  I saw a match between Fred Stolle and Pancho Gonzales.  <br>
Stolle hit a shot that was obviously wide.  The linesman called it in, <br>
and the umpire refused to overrule him.  Gonzales was furious.  <br>
On the next point, Stolle hit the ball into the net, and exchanged a look <br>
with Gonzales.  We all understood that he had given the point back.  <br>
When they changed sides, Stolle slowly walked over to the mark, <br>
which was three or four inches outside the line.  He pointed to it with <br>
his racquet, looked at the linesman, and said, in his wonderfully dry <br>
Australian accent, "Little bit out."  The linesman and the umpire both <br>
turned beet red, and everyone in the stands laughed and applauded.  <br>
