I think they do believe what they say.  But their willingness to <br>
believe it is coerced by their need for approval.  Most <br>
people feel good when they are not alone in a belief system (the <br>
author included).   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; seeker of truth is simply a fashionable thing to do; if a Christian claimed </i><br>

<i>&gt; to look good, not because they really mean it or even understand </i><br>
<i>&gt; what it </i><br>
<i>&gt; really means to seek the truth.</i><br>
<p>
I have a huge problem with what REALLY is the truth, mainly because <br>
REALLY is a subjective term.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Their blatant dogmatism is evidence that they </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't seek the truth,</i><br>
<p>
No.  It is evidence that they don`t seek your truth.  From what I`ve <br>
heard from many christians is that they have found, and are very <br>
happy with, "the" truth.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but it would be very bad for their image to admit that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Most people, Christians included, have no understanding of the intense </i><br>
<i>&gt; personal discipline required in seeking the truth,</i><br>
<p>
Your truth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and very few people are </i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to discipline themselves so severely.  To continually question and </i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt one's assumptions, to continually keep oneself open to seeing things </i><br>
<i>&gt; clearly, and to continually refine one's thinking skills are not easy </i><br>
<i>&gt; processes to maintain, and they require an extreme devotion to understanding </i><br>
<i>&gt; how things are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To accept some nice, cozy belief system is much easier, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; is also much less rewarding.</i><br>
<p>
It would be less rewarding for _you_ to accept such a cosy system, <br>
some people need the security.  <br>
<p>
You can`t ever escape a belief system, even if your belief is to shun <br>
beliefs...Aaaaahhhhh, I've spun a strange loop and can't get out.<br>
