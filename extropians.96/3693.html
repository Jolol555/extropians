Has anybody heard about the Creatures game?<br>
It was recently released in UK [and Australia ?],<br>
but hasn't made it into US yet.<br>
<p>
The game is said to be fun; the creatures,<br>
Norns, may be defined by users and can also evolve.<br>
<p>
(Isn't it interesting that humans always need<br>
some excitement to produce a new creature?<br>
Understanding of goals can never be as good an<br>
incentive as fun)<br>
<p>
Some information about the game can be found at<br>
<a href="http://www.cyberlife.co.uk">http://www.cyberlife.co.uk</a><br>
<p>
A review in German can be found at<br>

<p>
I haven't seen the game yet. (Just sent an info request)<br>

---------- From the site: "What is CyberLife?" ---------------<br>
<p>
CyberLife is our proprietary A-Life technology based on the<br>
application of biological metaphors to software-complexity<br>
problems. As software becomes increasingly complex we start<br>
to face problems of how to manage and understand the<br>
systems we build. However, the levels of complexity of these<br>
systems are trivial in comparison to those of even the most<br>
modest biological systems. Why then with all our genius,<br>
logic, and organizational abilities do we find it so difficult to<br>
build complex systems? After years of research it seems the<br>
reason and the problem all lie within the way we think of and<br>
approach complex systems. <br>
<p>
Traditionally, science was all about breaking down systems<br>
into their constituent parts. These parts would then be<br>
analyzed to reveal their structure and the functions they<br>
perform. This was the prominent endeavor of the 19th<br>
century, and was very useful as a method of gaining<br>
understanding about many things including simple biology,<br>
medicine and physics. During the 20th century, our endeavors<br>
focused on building systems, from the industrial revolution<br>
through to the digital revolution. However, somewhere along<br>
the way we had a paradigm shift and decided that the way to<br>
build or model complex systems was to consider the behavior<br>
required and try to capture this in high level constructs.<br>
Massive rule bases were developed in order to capture the<br>
intelligence and subtlety of human and animal behavior.<br>
Needless to say, these systems failed. <br>
<p>
The route of the problem seems to be that the abstracted<br>
knowledge has no grounding - there is no actual physical<br>
meaning to any of the concepts. Therefore, if the programmer<br>
of the system had not considered a possible situation, then the<br>
response of the system may turn out to be erratic, wrong or<br>
non-existent. Natural systems are rarely this brittle. All<br>
animals learn from experience and generalize. An animal will<br>
never be in the exact same situation twice, however it has the<br>
innate ability to reason about the similarities between its<br>
current situation and those it has experience in the past. The<br>
animal will then usually perform some action that was profitable<br>
to it in the similar situations of its past. If this is a<br>
bad thing for the animal to do, it will learn from its mistakes<br>
and try out some other behavior if faced with a similar<br>
situation in the future.<br>
<p>
Why then don't we base our artificial systems on biological<br>
systems? Well, that is exactly what we are doing with<br>
CyberLife. If we want a system that behaves like a small<br>
creature, then we build a small creature. We model large<br>
numbers of cells in the brain (neurons), and connect them up<br>
and send signals between them, in a way similar to natural<br>
cells. We model blood-streams and chemical reactions. We<br>
model a world for the creature to inhabit, and objects for the<br>
creature to interact with. Finally we model diseases, hunger,<br>
emotions, needs and the ability for the creature to grow,<br>
breed and evolve. Only then do you get a system that<br>
behaves like a creature.<br>
<p>
The first results form this philosophy can be seen in<br>
Creatures. Take a look, interact with them. Decide for<br>
yourself.<br>
