<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes! It works! I'm also highly skeptical about these things, and have never</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen results from other substances, such as chromium picolinate. However, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; decided to try creatine after Dr. Ray Sahelian, who is coming out with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; short book on the stuff (see the forthcoming Extropy for a review), did some</i><br>
<i>&gt; research and said it looked promising.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Interesting time for me to have brought this up, then!  And about<br>
chromium picolinate: I tried it for several months myself, and<br>
similarly found it inefficacious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; After two months using it, I gained about 10 lbs. Usually I gain much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; slowly, having been stable at around 183 lbs for months. I'm now 193 lbs. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think much, if any of it is fat. Possibly some may be extra fluid</i><br>
<i>&gt; retention, though I have no particular reason to think so. Certainly my</i><br>
<i>&gt; strength has increased considerably. E.g., I've gone from 580 lbs to 650 lbs</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the leg press, and from 80 lbs to 110 lbs (for 15 reps) on the barbell</i><br>
curl.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Your 580 lb on the leg press is close to what I'm doing on the<br>
same exercise, though I don't think I've reached my plateau for<br>
that on my present regimen.  I _am_ stuck at 198 lb of bodyweight,<br>
and am interested to see if creatine &amp; exercise would make a difference<br>
(present target: 205 lb bodyweight).  I'll need to read some more<br>
before I start it.  Also, before trying it in earnest, I plan a<br>
fitness evaluation to determine present states of weight, percentage<br>
bodyfat, cardiovascular fitness, and dimensions of major muscle<br>
groups.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm happy with the results!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Great!  I look forward to testing creatine for myself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I haven't tried it yet.  I'm told by a friend:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; ... Creatine Monohydrate is approximately 300 mg and costs $40.00;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the manufacturer is Sports Pharma, out of Concord.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can get a kilo for $80, or 450 g for about $45. Ray's book gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; guidelines for dosing. I got my from Lindberg/Nutrition Express:</i><br>
1-800-338-7979<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Will call and compare.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Get a bigger body to go along with that bigger brain!</i><br>

<p>
But of course!<br>
