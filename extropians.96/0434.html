Actually I'm not sure it's an extropian novel yet, since I've only read a<br>
quarter way through. But it certainly presents cryonics and uploading ideas<br>
very accurately and sympathetically. The author, Peter James, obviously did<br>
considerable research, consulting with the Alcor Foundation, and most of you<br>
will recognize several names among the acknowledgments, including - on this<br>
list - Marvin Minsky (if he's still reading the list) and Russell Whitaker.<br>
<p>
I can't help like a book with the following paragraph. The context: Our<br>
hero, uploading researcher, brilliant scientist Prof. Joe Messenger, has<br>
returned to his lab in England from Los Angeles, and is opening his<br>
accumulated mail:<br>
<p>
"He cheered a little as he came across one that bore the frank of one of his<br>
publishers, and might contain reviews of his most recent book, The Computer<br>
That Loved Ben-Hur. He slit open the envelope and was pleased to see a group<br>
of clippings: an interview he'd done with the Guardian; a review in New<br>
Scientist; a more lengthy review in The Sunday Times, which he scanned and<br>
was reasonably happy with, even though the reviewer appeared to have totally<br>
missed the fundamental point of the book. And there was what looked like a<br>
rave write-up in a small California magazine he much admired, called<br>
Extropy, which pleased him more than anything."<br>
