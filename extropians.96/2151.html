We know that apes are probably self-aware. G Gallup made an experiment <br>
where a chimp were anesthetized and a red spot was placed on its face. <br>
When the chimp awoke, it was handed a mirror. Seeing its face, it tried <br>
to rub off the spot, which implies that it knew the mirror image was <br>
itself. Thus we can expect that chimps have a self-model.<br>
<p>
See Gallup, G. G. Jr (1979) Self-awareness in primates. American <br>
Scientist 67 417-421 [I love when I actually got a bibliography nearby!]<br>
<p>
Gallup also did this with small children, and found that self-awareness <br>
appears during the second year of life (Gallup, G. G., Jr. &amp; Suarez, S. <br>
D. (1986) Self-awareness and the emergence of mind in humans and other <br>
primates. In J. Suks &amp; A. G. Greenwald (Eds.) Psychological perspectives <br>
on the self (Vol 3). Hillsdalem NJ: Erlbaum.).<br>
<p>
I think memes are more important in building up our minds than creating<br>
our consciousness, which seem to be a mental construct. One should also<br>
remember that consciousness is not the same thing as self-awareness: <br>
people with dissociative disorders may be conscious but lack clear<br>
self-awareness. <br>
