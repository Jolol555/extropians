Do you really think _everybody_ wants to be free and "correct"... Sounds like<br>
something from George Orwell _1984_ or Thought Police would say to me.  Don't<br>
you think criminals will be in the place?  Or will I be a "criminal" for not<br>
thinking like you?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;then why should someone be able to <br>
 force others to work for them, by offering them the "choice", between <br>
 starvation and slavery.<br>

Do you really think it's force? . . . a choice between starvation or slavery?<br>
  You can't (or won't) see _any_ other options in our vast and diversified<br>
world today?  You are very pessimistic if you can't see other alternatives.<br>
  I guess farming is too "low" for you to consider.  I don't know of any<br>
place on Earth a person can't be a farmer.   But, I'm sure you'll bend over<br>
backwards to (pessimistically) find a place where you can't farm.<br>
 Antarctica?  Ok, how about hunting then?  . . . Don't want animals to get<br>
hurt.  Gathering?  . . .Too messy.  The only think left is your benevolence.<br>
 Hail to the benevolent King.  Your plan doesn't empower people to help<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
People should not accept your addicting benevolence if they want to be self<br>
empowered.  Instead:<br>
I think: Everybody on Earth works for themselves.  WE ARE ALL SELF-EMPLOYED.<br>
 This means personal responsibility to the people your customers.  For a<br>
child the customer is the friends, father and mother . For an adult it is<br>
your co-workers, supervisor, buyer of your labor, husband, wife, friend,<br>
lover. <br>
