<p>
Yes! Opportunity is definetely there, if you  are<br>
willing to take the risk. It is an art. A WAY OF<br>
THINKING! " heh, a state of being..... zenlike, etc.<br>
<p>
I agreed with your post , some form of D.O is included  <br>
in well thought out philosophies (dragging in Carlos<br>
Casteneda confused me a bit because from what <br>
I have heard from Casteneda people, there is a <br>
mysticism and magic, something about hidden doors,<br>
reality not being real, and energy leaks throughout the<br>
body- ie: a whole lot of mumbo jumbo that I could<br>
hardly follow; - )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Most people miss those opportunities because they err on the side of</i><br>
skepticism.<br>
<p>
Here I agree with the premise... but...<br>
The thing I would change: is say, rather than skepticism, <br>
"err on the side of *pessimism* " OR err by<br>
"beating one's self up".<br>
<p>
Skepticism and optimism work REALLY well together. <br>
A good dose of both and one will avoid many pitfalls.<br>
<p>
The true skeptic is open minded. I know that cynics and<br>
skeptics look much the same, but it is a totally different<br>
mind set ; )<br>
<p>
Dynamic (ever changing) and Optimistic (looking at, <br>
expecting, the best) are best achieved by being<br>
*very good to one's self*, a lesson that  the most<br>
intelligent of us often overlook in the quest<br>
for being "right" or perfect.<br>
<p>
Max More has some great insights on this. Even, I<br>
I believe, a well developed curriculum on D.O.<br>
<p>
Maybe he could be inticed to post a minimized <br>
version of this most excellent course <br>
on the Extro page...<br>
