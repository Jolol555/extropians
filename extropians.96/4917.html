<i>&gt; But attitudes have dramatically skyrocketed for the worse </i><br>
<i>&gt; this holiday season. Is it due to bad family relations, being trapped </i><br>
<i>&gt; indoors due to bad weather, too much holiday candy creating </i><br>
<i>&gt; exorbitant sugar rushes? What?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (P.S. Sorry to use you as an example Lyle, it's just the final straw </i><br>
<i>&gt; for me.) "Can't we all just get along?" :)</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry if I upset you, Chris.  Mike Lorrey called me a liar and said <br>
I shouldn't be on the list; I'm not really trying to get along with him <br>
at this point.  And Kathryn's post was the last straw for me.  I had to <br>
say something.  But you're right, tempers have been flaring too much <br>
recently.  It wouldn't hurt if we all took a deep breath and relaxed.  <br>
<p>
Happy New Year to all, <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
