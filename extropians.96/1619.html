As a newbie to the extropian and transhuman lists, I have to say I regret<br>
the tone of rancor that seems to have crept into these public postings of<br>
late.  Perhaps it's a cyclical phenomenon.  I, for one, have enjoyed and<br>
learned from both John's and Lyle's posts, and have written privately to<br>
both of them to say so (and to seek permission from them to include their<br>
declared opinions in the book I'm now writing on the Singularity).  It<br>
strikes me that Lyle keeps raising quite salient questions about the<br>
*detailed architecture and practise* of certain canonical nano claims, but<br>
does so in a teasing and finally annoyingly flip manner.  John (among<br>
others) seems to respond as if Lyle's requests for detailed flow-charts are<br>
redundant and even slightly blasphemous acts of lese majeste.<br>
<p>
This is a shame, because we need the detail even more than the grand<br>
speculative strokes.<br>
<p>
To consider a recent exchange: I asked whether people in an early nano<br>
society might be obliged to accept draconian authoritarian controls to<br>
forestall self-obliterative use of an Unstoppable Salt Mill (you know, the<br>
fairytale device that explains why the sea is salt - it's down under the<br>
water even now, cranking out its ceaseless stream of salt).  The range of<br>
responses stretched from (a) it can't happen, because nano assemblers can<br>
only do X and even that only with great difficulty, (b) it can and probably<br>
will but that's okay because we (we?) will be off the planet by then (by<br>
2015?!) [and why won't the folks in the habitat or on Mars also bugger<br>
things up with their handy assemblers?], (c) it's cool, because we (we???)<br>
will have Transcended.  Do you see why Lyle (category a) might think he was<br>
dealing with the Santa Claus Fan club?<br>
<p>
On the other hand, this is not the kind of blithe response Drexler and his<br>
colleagues offered in UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE: `Any critic declaring this to<br>
be an optimistic book hereby stands charged with having failed to read and<br>
understand...' [p. 259]<br>
<p>
But Lyle's apparently odd assertion that molecular manufacturing devices<br>
would only be able to make limited diamondoid structures rather than, say,<br>
sarin gas, is absolutely inconsistent with everything I've read about the<br>
projected technology.  Instead of declaring the boosters' claims `very<br>
boring', I wish he'd given detailed analyses of why modularised,<br>
bottom-up-bootstrapping nanomech systems are impracticable.  I suspect he<br>
shares my hunch that orders of magnitude are being scamped when someone<br>
easily gestures toward replication via atom-by-atom scanning, or the AI<br>
sophistication required to do the same job top-down.  <br>
<p>
Of course it might be that he and John and the rest of you have been down<br>
these dialogical roads enough times already that it's only the newbie who<br>
feels at a loss, seeing the torn rags of old battles  brandished above the<br>
smoke...<br>
<p>
Best to all, Damien<br>
