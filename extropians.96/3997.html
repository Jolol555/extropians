<p>
	Not at all.  Perhaps I should have said that they have evolved, on<br>
the most part, for practicle purposes.  Emotions serve a variety of<br>
functions and are not the mystical entities that David Musick makes them<br>
out to be.  He states "How about feelings?  Logic is not the only thing<br>
that drives us.", giving the impression that he views feelings as<br>
something "beyond" logic and reason and not subject to the same rules.  If<br>
I misinterpreted you David, I apologize, but I'm not certain that I did.<br>
Emotions and "feeling" are based on goal oriented drives, they help to<br>
push us in the correct directions (of course the meaning of "correct" can<br>
be debated.  What we view as our goal may not be consistent with what<br>
goals our emotions evolved to drive us to.).  I believe that both physical<br>
sensation and mental emotion are design to do this.  Take for instance the<br>
simple feeling of pain one feels while being burned, I'm sure you can<br>
reason out why we feel this.  But more on the subject at hand, mainly our<br>
mental "feelings".  When one "loves" a person, what one may experience on<br>
the conscious level is simply the joyous sensation, but could it be that<br>
one is so strongly drawn to the person it "loves" because they can provide<br>
benefit to the individual?  Aid in bearing offspring?  Maybe the person<br>
being loved has an area of expertise that the lover does not possess, and<br>
is crucial to his/her survival.  My point is, emotions have REASONS, they<br>
are not mystical in any sense, they ARE reasonable, they work on the<br>
principles of logic (we won't discuss WHAT logic *grin*), you may just<br>
have to step out and analyze it from the outside to discover it's true<br>
purpose.<br>

<p>
	Much agreed, but you can not deny that evolution, whether it has<br>
failed in spots or not, has been goal oriented.  Everything happens for a<br>
reason.	 Keep in mind that I am not insisting that it is being directed in<br>
any sense, because I am not.  <br>
