<p>
 Just like a stream of consciousness ceases when I go to sleep<br>
and a separate stream of consciousness is created when my body<br>
wakes up? There will probably be something unique about the<br>
discontinuity involved in uploading, but I have heard no reason<br>
to expect that the mind which uploading produces lacks anything<br>
that the mind which will inhabit my body after a more familiar<br>
discontinuity has.<br>

<p>
 Greater wealth through the ability to work at faster clock speeds.<br>
More security through the ability to make distributed backups.<br>
