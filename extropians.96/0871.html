Last posting I mistook a response by Eugene Leitl at Univ. Muenchen <br>
(Ludwig Maximillian) for Max More.   It was not Max More.  Should you<br>
respond to either his original message, or my response, please be clear<br>
about this.  Eugene and I are in disagreement about the complexity (or<br>
lack thereof) of future hyperintelligence motivations.<br>
<p>
This gives me the opportunity to pose a question about such motivations. <br>
I, for one, am not convinces that a future AI civilization (or overlordship<br>
of a single such entity) will be inexorably driven to dismantle and convert<br>
all available resources in the system--including Earth.  Such a process is<br>
could just as likely be a distraction from it's purpose as in support of it. <br>
But usually, the motivation of &lt;consume and grow/reproduce&gt; is a<br>
function of the lower mind (or no mind at all), basic but controllable,<br>
especially for higher intellectual pursuits or complex cultural gratification.<br>
<p>
Also, anybody out there taking DHEA-Dehydroepiandrosterone? <br>
Anybody old enough to consider it?<br>
<p>
-Tim (always talking about motivations)<br>
