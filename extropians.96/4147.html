I fail to understand what you are getting at.  I have taken many courses in<br>
computer architecture.  I am familiar with evolution of very low level as<br>
well as higher level constructs.  I have even designed and fabricated simple<br>
integrated circuits from scratch.  I could design a basic ALU from the<br>
ground up if I had to.  I even understand how and why different types of<br>
transistors and transistor materials do what they do on a chemical level.<br>
What part don't I understand?<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're saying that if we don't understand what a machine does we couldn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;design it. The same child could design a machine that will move an object in  </i><br>
<i>&gt;water and create a turbulent flow. Do you understand turbulence?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, yes.  I *do* understand turbulence (as well as anyone does).  I<br>
spent quite a bit of time studying and modeling mass transport phenomena<br>
including boundary layer phenomena and laminar/turbulent flow transitions.<br>
Turbulence is actually a good example on your part, since it is a chaotic<br>
system that is described in engineering as a mostly empirical phenomenon.<br>
But our difficulty in adequately describing turbulence has to do with the<br>
complexity of the system, a level of complexity not found in the study of<br>
elementary arithmetic logic structures.<br>
<p>
I have formal education in chemical engineering, despite my career in the<br>
software industry.  Turbulence is a standard part of chemical engineering<br>
programs and I did significant research in the area of turbulent flows while<br>
at the university.  But you probably would not have known this.  :-)<br>
<p>
It sounds like you are saying that it is impossible for humans to truly<br>
understand anything.  I might possibly be able to grant this (tentatively)<br>
for some general physics-like knowledge because we don't know everything.<br>
But I find it difficult to subscribe to the thought that we don't "really"<br>
understand constructs that we conceived of and designed from the ground up,<br>
especially abstract constructs.  Computer computation is an abstract concept<br>
of which computers are only one expression.  You can duplicate the binary<br>
computational sequence by arranging and moving pebbles.  This to me, the<br>
ability to express the construct on any substrate, indicates a clear<br>
understanding of the phenomenon.<br>
