<i>&gt;Eugene Leitl proposes to make routine low-overhead encryption part of </i><br>
<i>&gt;TCP/IP.  I am only claiming that NSA can tell the difference between </i><br>
<i>&gt;an encrypted message generated by such a routine algorithm, and one </i><br>
<i>&gt;generated by a more sophisticated algorithm.  Not that they can read the </i><br>
<i>&gt;messages, just that they can tell which is which.  </i><br>
<p>
This is not necessarily true.  You have several fast encryption algorithms<br>
available today that are sufficiently strong as to be essentially<br>
indistinguishable from other "strong" algorithms.  It will would depend on<br>
exactly which algorithm is used.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; A good pseudo-random number generator is indistinguishable </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; from a true set of random numbers.  The RC4 stream cipher (= PRNG) </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is a case in point.  The output has a totally white spectrum.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The only thing that makes it "pseudorandom" is that it is generated </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; deterministically.  The output is indistinguishable from </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; non-deterministic random noise.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is that a theorem?  Are you saying that trying to distinguish between </i><br>
<i>&gt;these outputs is like trying to find a rational number whose square is 2?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If it's not a theorem -- and I don't think it is -- then I wouldn't be </i><br>
<i>&gt;too quick to assert that it is *impossible* to distinguish between </i><br>
<i>&gt;different kinds of pseudorandomness.  I could be wrong, but my </i><br>
<i>&gt;mathematical common sense tells me that each algorithm leaves </i><br>
<i>&gt;some kind of fingerprint, and distinguishing between them is </i><br>
<i>&gt;just a matter of cleverness and patience.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes and no.  For "weak" PRNGs, it is usually possible to ascertain<br>
distinguishing traits in the output stream that suggest the content of the<br>
input stream or seed.  The fact that the output produces a distinguishing<br>
pattern is what makes them weak and therefore unsuitable for cryptographic<br>
purposes.  For "strong" PRNGs there are (as yet) no known distinguishing<br>
cycles or patterns in the output that suggest the content of the input<br>
components.  To discover patterns and cycles in a PRNG usually means that it<br>
can be fairly easily cracked as cypher.  Identifying characteristics of PRNG<br>
output lets the code-breaker gain knowledge regarding the state of the PRNG<br>
at points in time.  This substantially limits the total search space for<br>
brute force attacks by eliminating huge chunks of keyspace.  In the case of<br>
RC4, the total number of possible states is 10^1700.  If no cycles or<br>
patterns are found, then cracking this cypher is much more formidable than<br>
the usual off-the-shelf symmetric cyphers like IDEA and DES.<br>
<p>
But like factoring, we cannot currently prove the complexity of the problem.<br>
In the specific case of RC4 however, the algorithm is extremely simple and<br>
therefore fairly easy to analyze for weaknesses.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;What I am doing -- not in this thread particularly, but in general -- is </i><br>
<i>&gt;the opposite of encryption.  I am trying to decrypt my thoughts.  I am </i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to create a vocabulary in which I can make myself understood.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;The most subversive thing I can do is to tell the truth in plain English.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;But first I have to establish a context within which my ideas will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligible.  This has been the purpose of all my posts from day one.  </i><br>
