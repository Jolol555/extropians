<p>
I'm currently catalogueing my 2500+ techno records, if you'd like i can send<br>
you a list of bands that deal with our memes (when i'm finished, that is...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now in the mid nineties it seems that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;techno scene has found a level, where a few bands are playing purely</i><br>
<i>&gt;electronic music, a lot are playing hybrid music a some simply play rock'n</i><br>
<i>&gt;roll. So there is a very wide spectre of genres. Most of them seem to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;a mix of "natural" and electronic sounds.</i><br>
<p>
I put it to you that over half of todays releases are purely electronic.<br>
However they are distributed by small independants. I estimate an average<br>
300 new techno releases a week alone. Mostly vinyl, in avarage editions of<br>
300-2000 copies. Furthermore this leads to over 50% of all musicians<br>
(probably far less on a professional level) making purely electronic music.<br>
At least 1/4th of those will still be around in the next decade, which could<br>
lead to an interesting speculation on what influence that will have on music<br>
in general.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It will probably be a good way to promote transhuman/extropian ideas, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the audience for that kind of art probably will be some of the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;receptive for the memes.</i><br>
<p>
And what about computer games ? The strategy (more specifically: world<br>
builder) genre holds a lot in common with our memes, (space colonization,<br>
new technology development etc) And let us not forget comics...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Global underground distribution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another thing that happened with techno was that no big labels were</i><br>
<i>&gt;interrested in distibuting it. So a huge network of small independent (punk</i><br>
<i>&gt;inspired) record labels made a huge "underground" distribution network</i><br>
<i>&gt;between themself. The techno scene is now very global and it's become that</i><br>
<i>&gt;way in a distributed, chaotic self-organising way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The same will probably happen with all of the underground</i><br>
<i>&gt;multimedia/desktopvideo etc.</i><br>
<p>
Although the number of musicians and new labels is still rising, this year<br>
will have seen it's first drop in the number of people being able to work in<br>
techno music on a 'professional' level. As more and more semi-professionals<br>
and amateurs overflow the slower expanding market with their 'home made'<br>
products. this has been a 'crisis' year for many small techno companies,<br>
throwing many back to the semi-professional level.  <br>
<p>
Youth culture in general is still dominated by the cyberpunk negative future<br>
image. But a change is taking place rapidly. Whereas kraftwerk and the black<br>
electro music of the first half of the eighties were still very anti<br>
computer/technolgy dominated, and the music was intended to show the<br>
contrast, Todays techno producers seem to promote the ideas of space<br>
colonization, the love for computers and machines, and science and<br>
technology are rapidly becoming a fascination for them. <br>
