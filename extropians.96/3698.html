Now Brin himself has come out seriously proposing that privacy is evil,<br>
and that we should restructure society to prevent it!  <br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
I take his major point to be that, much as "good pitching beats good <br>
hitting", good surveillance beats good privacy. Or to roughly quote <br>
him, what good does ironclad crypto do you if a gnat-sized camera can <br>
shoulder-surf you while you type?<br>
<p>
I haven't spoken with him personally about this, and he does tend to <br>
be rather firm in his opinions, but I took his commentary as being <br>
more intended to knock down false confidence in privacy that may not <br>
exist for very much longer. <br>
<p>
There are parallel issues relating to authentication of data (see <br>
_Rising Sun_, for example). But to keep to the matter at hand...<br>
<p>
In effect, if the choice is between one Big Brother _or_ a ton <br>
of Little Brothers, old-style privacy perforce goes away. He doesn't <br>
see a third option.  I'm not sure I do either.<br>
<p>
I don't see that as Luddite. I think asking the questions shows <br>
foresight.<br>
