I wrote about extropians as "Bottom Up Fast Futurists". &amp;<br>
arkuat@factory.net (Eric Watt Forste) replies:<br>

<i>&gt;I like this analysis, and I think it's correct as far as it goes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But you know, when most people ask for definitions, they want a genus and</i><br>
<i>&gt;differentiator. And the sad fact is that they usually want to be presented</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a genus that they already understand and a differentiator that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;already understand.</i><br>
<p>
I know!  How about "Personal Futurists?!"<br>
<p>
with connotations (&amp; I'm into ambivalence and irony):<br>
 o  Seeing oneself in the future,<br>
 o  seeing your personal future as worthy of an "ism,"<br>
    as in "Maxism" (love it!),<br>
 o  creating the future,<br>
 o  self-transformation,<br>
 o  bottom-up, accessible tech (as in personal computers, personal copiers,<br>
    personal fax machines, personal hygene, etc.), and how about<br>
 o  your own personal futurist!<br>
<p>
(Btw, I imagine "person" can apply to trans- or post-humans.  Also, "trans-<br>
personal," as in "trans-personal psychology," means between people.)<br>

 How many times have you fallen in love with a lyric that you thought went,<br>
    "Show me a day with Hilda Ogden and I'll despair,"<br>
 only to find out that it went,<br>
    "Show me a way to solve your problems and I'll be there."  --Seal<br>
