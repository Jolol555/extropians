<i>&gt;&gt; Thanks for a posting which mentions a much avoided topic re</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; transhumanism and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; uploads - BUGS! If my experience with my PC is any guide, I will be wary</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of uploading for quite some time...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, creating a stable environment for uploads is a nontrivial problem. </i><br>
<i>&gt;We need a large number of processes that interact in a robust, efficient </i><br>
<i>&gt;way (no, no upload can run as a single process - physics prevents that </i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful single processor systems, we have to go parallel) that can </i><br>
<i>&gt;withstand errors, breakdowns and crashes.</i><br>
<p>
Take it beyond this. Perhaps we will not be able to upload to silicon very<br>
well. Perhaps we'll need to create better and better combination<br>
bio/silicon brain structures and nano transplant your brain into the mass<br>
to grow into the new brain structure like bone grows into coral. We all<br>
know that bio doesn't crunch numbers well and silicon doesn't parallel<br>
process as well as bio does so we need a centrist view of the optimal brain<br>
habitat and structure. Merging the best of both.<br>
