Surely it depends on the kind of model being used. IMHO, diffusing<br>
chemical<br>
signals will have to be part of such models, and many of them might be<br>
easily<br>

More fascinating is that the possible variety of such simulated drug<br>
experiences<br>
would vastly exceed what can be done with physical molecules. Check out<br>
PIKHAL by<br>
Alesander Shulgin which is a fascinating account of what has been done<br>
with molecules...<br>
