	Mankind's past is a bloody mess.<br>
<p>
	The land in Europe was repeatedly stolen time after time though<br>
usually the people were of the same race and religion.  In the longer<br>
view, alien races and ethnicities repeatedly swept accross Europe looting,<br>
pillaging, and appropriating the land.<br>
<p>
	I dare say Native Americans stole land from each other as well.<br>
<p>
	While I do not want in the slightest to minimize the theft of land<br>
by Europeans which occured all over the globe during the Imperialist era,<br>
historical wrongs cannot be "brought to book" on collective racial or<br>
ethic basis.<br>
<p>
	What is necessary is to deny current holders of property of all<br>
kinds the special protections of government...government interventions and<br>
regulations that cartelize and limit competition should be eliminated.<br>
It is especially important that the Federal Reserve be eliminated as it<br>
allows the elite to constantly re-capitalize themselves by creating money<br>
out of nothing.<br>
<p>
	The sham Objectivist Alan Greenspan even admitted that his policy<br>
was designed to "build balance sheets" when he testified in front of<br>
Congress a few years ago.  He was asked why he was holding interest rates<br>
high while the economy slid into recession in the early '90s.<br>
<p>
	Of course, this policy was designed to "save the banking system<br>
(cartel)", not enrich or save the elite owners of the system!<br>
