I've greatly enjoyed the many discussions stemming from my suggestion of <br>
an Economy based on Peer Networking.  Unfortunately, I'm still <br>
formulating my theory as I present it, and judging from the many turns <br>
these conversations have taken, I've likely been too implicit in <br>
conveying my thoughts...<br>
<p>
While the Free Lunch is a rare thing today, we are living in an open <br>
system, and Free Lunches (before history) have been the exception and <br>
not the rule.  I am not suggesting we all go back to the Stone Age... <br>
clearly it is not feasible to live the hunter gatherer existance that <br>
Humanity used to know.   But our methods of production and gathering <br>
have changed with time, and sooner or later, so will money.<br>
<p>
In this Information Age, we have learned many lessons from the <br>
Industrial Era, both good and bad.  We have changed our sources of <br>
energy from natural sources to unreplenishable fossil fuels, and then <br>
back.  We have gone from conservation, to "bigger is always better," <br>
back to conservational downsizing.  It is entirely feasible for humanity <br>
to adopt a Free Lunch program, if there is significant interest.  <br>
(Perhaps it may never reach Earth by the time it is adopted on <br>
extraplanetary colonies.)  If there is enough interest, humanity will<br>
find a way to make it happen.<br>
<p>
The reason we do not currently have Free Lunches is that the Large <br>
population of humans on Earth does not preclude the limited supply of <br>
food from being unfairly consumed by 'unfairly' small numbers.  <br>
Food "just happens" on our world, but does not happen fast enough <br>
without the attention and technology of today's farms and producers.<br>
The current method for controlling this is to ration our consumption <br>
by means of the monetary "merit system."  Yet for good or bad, this is <br>
not the only solution, nor is it eternal.<br>
<p>
The idea of rationing treats the symptom, not the cause.  It controls <br>
only a person's excess of demand, not the shortage of supply.  As <br>
Extropians, I expect that we would be more interested in lifting limits <br>
on our ability to sustain ourselves.<br>
<p>
I foresee a change in money for a few reasons:<br>
 o Government Regulation tends to increase our need to serve money<br>
   by causing even land owners to own taxes on land.<br>
 o The past economy of depletible resources is being supplanted by<br>
   an economy of undepletible knowledge and information.<br>
   (It's not "spent" when shared.)<br>
 o With every new invention, we see that there is less work that we <br>
   'have to' do, as more of it it done by technology.  Yet likewise   <br>
there is less work we HAVE 'to do,' and jobs become fewer or less <br>
   rewarding.  Eventually, this could hit critical mass if the old <br>
   monetary "merit system" determines who controls the others' holdings.<br>
<p>
It is a characteristic of humans (at least here in America) to desire<br>
Freedom.  Yet we currently are enslaved to money, forsaking our personal <br>
interests in exchange for 'earning our keep.'  It was worse in the <br>
Industrial Era, where the few individuals who run the corporations were <br>
the ones whose personal interests the business best served.<br>
<p>
These days, we are seeing a shift.  A business holds together if there<br>
are enough players who are unified by a common goal or vision.  A boss's <br>
desires are rarely served by 'mindless masses' anymore... but there is <br>
still the power of numbers when a team is unified by purpose.  (And <br>
still the scarey existance of mass-produced mob mentalities.)  Yet these<br>
days humans are not interchangible parts... they have skills, knowledge,<br>
and interests that determine their value to a team.<br>
<p>
Commodities are valued differently by everyone.  It puzzles me how the<br>
stock market determines so much of value when this planet is actually<br>
covered by six billion walking talking economies of their own!  Some<br>
produce surplusses of their special commodity, but won't share it unless<br>
convinced that your use would serve their interests.  (Often from a<br>
marketting angle.)<br>
<p>
There are some good reads found at <a href="http://www.newciv.org">http://www.newciv.org</a> ,<br>
but I still think that the solution lies in a paradigm shift,<br>
from hierarchial client-server money-consumer notions, to <br>
a peer-to-peer sharing of interests and efforts.  If we make it worth <br>
while for people to direct their efforts together with our own, it could<br>
conceivably obsolete the monitary system.<br>
