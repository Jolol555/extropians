Brrr.  The student "Houses" at Caltech are combined social and living<br>
units, vaguely a cross between a dormitory and a fraternity.  We all<br>
know each other, live near each other, eat with each other, population<br>
50-100 people.  And I strongly challenge the claim that a community<br>
meeting cannot be as crazy as a bureaucracy.  For House matters we don't<br>
have much alternative, except just trusting the President and other<br>
officers (which is fine when I trust the officers :-) but I'd hate to<br>
live somewhere which had all economic decisions trusted to such a<br>
process.<br>

I was going to crusade to improve the conditions of the masses by force,<br>
I would much rather redistribute the wealth, the property, on a one-time<br>
basis.  As private property, to individuals; not to communes.<br>

How do you guarantee the right to leave?  What would stop some commune<br>
from keeping slaves?<br>

Noise, not argument.  You _have_ noticed that John Clark advocates<br>
anarchy?  Just a propertarian anarchy?<br>

... The Anarchists' [national] anthem is an international anthem that<br>
consists of 365 raspberries blown in very quick succession to the tune<br>
of "Camptown Races".  Nobody has to stand up for it, nobody has to<br>
listen to it, and, even better, nobody has to play it.<br>
