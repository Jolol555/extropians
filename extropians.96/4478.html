Because Java itself is a Language rather than an operating system, and<br>
is now an open standard, meaning anyone can do stuff with it, as well as<br>
the fact that the four individuals who developed Java at SUN have gone<br>
off to their own startups producing java products, I would say Sun's<br>
success as related to Java is more a matter of what it does with it for<br>
cross platform OS's or apps etc. Now that verification classes are<br>
coming out next year, the security bugs in java that were neccessary to<br>
make its most powerful tools work that were initially closed will now be<br>
opened and enhanced. This should also be accompanied by an explosion in<br>
the long awaited net trade.<br>
