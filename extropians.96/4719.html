Extropian movie dealing with desiring eternal youth:<br>
<p>
Cocoon -  "Old" folks at a retirement home regain their youth from the<br>
life-giving qualities found in a swimming in a pool filled with alien beings<br>
in large clam-like cocoons. <br>
<p>
What I love about this film is that the folks really want to be youthful and<br>
extreme longevity. Very upbeat, full of delightful parallels to extropic<br>
thinking. (****)<br>
<p>
Extropian movie dealing with self-transformation:<br>
<p>
Gound Hog Day - Man repeats same day until he gets it right.  <br>
<p>
This is one of my favorites because the lead character eventually becomes<br>
his optimal self.  It's not done an easy way - by pulling the wool over<br>
others' eyes and pretending - but through his learning new skills and<br>
actually changing his behavior and personality. (****)<br>
