Sorry, Chris, I knew I'd put my foot in it as soon as I hit the<br>
"send" button. I should have stuck with "student". The point remians<br>
the same, however: the list benefits greatly from your quest for<br>
breadth. IMO, it also benefits from the tighter focus of some of the<br>
other contributors.<br>
<p>
My focus is almost entirely on the Singularity. I've been interested in<br>
the future of humanity since I was in junior high school, which was<br>
a LONG time ago. However, since reading Vernor Vinge's "Marooned in<br>
Realtime", I've been unable to retain any real enthusiasm for<br>
speculations about post-singularity humanity, since I don't think<br>
humanity will be relevant. I also think the singularity will happen<br>
within ten years. Speculation about transhumans or other<br>
post-Singularity beings, if any, are IMO about as useful and productive<br>
as speculations about God. Just becaus I feel this way is no reason that<br>
you and others should feel the same. Please continue in your quest for<br>
breadth.<br>
