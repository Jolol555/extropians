<i>&gt;I'd argue that all "motivation", the kind that actually gets you out </i><br>
<i>&gt;of  bed in the morning, bent on doing something other than </i><br>
<i>&gt;elimination or(perhaps) eating,  is emotional/chemical at root. </i><br>
<p>
I suppose you're right. I would've never gotten into science &amp; tech if it<br>
wasn't for the euphoric feeling of creating new ideas. That particular<br>
feeling would be nonexistant under complete logic. But then maybe some<br>
emotions are vestigial such as sadness which only appears to be harmful in<br>
that it makes you nonproductive. Maybe we should all just think... Our<br>
friend has died. life goes on. but we don't we feel sadness. Why? What<br>
practical purpose does it serve?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Logic is *useful*--SOMETIMES.</i><br>
<p>
ALOT<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Emotions are *fun*--SOMETIMES.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are emotions ever useful? Is logic ever fun? Hmm--I'd say yes. Hmmmm.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose you're right. Perhaps they go hand in hand. Maybe we need subtler<br>
more complex emotions? Perhaps thats what we're evolving to.<br>
