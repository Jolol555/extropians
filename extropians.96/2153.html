Mostly in _Across Realtime_ (especially in _Marooned in Realtime_, the <br>
final story) and _A Fire Upon the Deep_, but there are mentions in other <br>
stories too (as others have pointed out). <br>

A perversion war would be *fast* on a planet (and the chilling thing is <br>
that many nations are gearing up for it - information warfare is HOT <br>
right now), and probably would be over quickly - leaving more normal <br>
kinds of conflict. If the enemies were 100 ly apart, then it would take <br>
too long to hack into somebody from afar, so agents have to be sent into <br>
the enemy system (which is a very uncertain prospect unless you are a SI).<br>
<p>
SLIGHT SPOILERS: An interesting take on this is the Meme Wars in Barnes'<br>
_Caleidoscope Century_: memes (Barnes' version) are AI systems able to<br>
transmit/translate themselves across operating systems, including into the<br>
human nervous system (shades of _Snow Crash_). These memes started out as<br>
weapons of religious warfare, but quickly began to mutate and take control<br>
over regions. Each meme fought the other memes and sought more hosts, both<br>
by infiltrating the media, contagion or direct coercion (the protagonist<br>
was part of a mercenary team working for a meme). Finally a meme invents a<br>
distributed model of itself and begins to turn humanity into a kind of<br>
borganism (individuals still exist, but they all run the same memes). <br>
