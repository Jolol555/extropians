<i>&gt; People with money do not neccessarily get it from the majority of people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think the majority of people want to pay for sonic toothbrushes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Only the rich do.</i><br>
<p>
now you're being ludicrous.  you obviously have no idea of where the<br>
rich people get their money from. The overwhelming majority of wealth in<br>
this country is in real estate. Something which EVERYONE needs. If<br>
someone makes an ugly house, on a toxic waste dump, its not gonna sell,<br>
and if it does, they won't be in business too long after.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I vote for those who most effectively service my needs. A cruel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; task master am I. My ballots are limited only by the degree to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which I do or do not service the needs of others. Democracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cannot possibly give all candidates an equal share of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; votes, such would be the logical abolition of the demo-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cratic process, and yet that's exactly what the soc-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ialist yearns for.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You have more ballots than most people. If you become rich enough, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't matter what other people think, you can impose your will on them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's what I think will happen with unrestrained capitalism. You will</i><br>
<i>&gt; either get an dictatorial oligarchy with more money than everybody else,</i><br>
<p>
if someone has more bucks, they are obviously doing something right, and<br>
would be more likely to know how to properly manage things than some<br>
bum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or you willget a traditional Marxist revolution type thing. I don't like</i><br>
<i>&gt; either ofthose things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If you stop listening to your customers, they will stop listening to<br>
you.  YOU have never been in business successfully have you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is an utopia illogical?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'm advocating voluntary socialism, pretty much. No I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; impose this by force, because that's just not right.</i><br>
<p>
no one will voluntarily become a slave. Socialism enslaves people to the<br>
will of the majority in power.<br>
<p>
Free market does not care what you look like, what you beleive, etc..<br>
What it cares about is 1)what can I do for you today? (when was the last<br>
time you saw a gov't bureaucrat say that with a smile?) 2) When do you<br>
need it? and 3) How much do you want to pay for it? If an equitable<br>
voluntary agreement is reached on those terms, then a sale is made, and<br>
a consumer is happy.  Free market breeds hapiness.  Ask any salesman,<br>
who is not just out to make a buck, but a real salesman, what they like<br>
the most about their jobs, and 9 times out of 10 they'll say they like<br>
making people happy.  Bet you can't get the same response from 10<br>
bureacrats.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I like democracy, but only when there's options for the minority as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the majority.</i><br>
<p>
Freemarket capitalism means there is a nich for everyone and the<br>
cumulative demands of individuals motivate producers to produce as much<br>
as is neccessary, unlike in an oligopoly or socialist state, where one<br>
size fits all, and if there isn't enough, too bad.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay, thought experiment:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We get rid of all coercive institutions, both government and corporations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we see what social structures turn up. You say the natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship between humans is trade. I say it's cooperation. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think our ability to cooperate was vital to our evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; success.</i><br>
<p>
Fortunately, we are working on just that. haven't you noticed that since<br>
government has deregulated businesses that 1) prices have gone down, and<br>
2) they've gotten a lot more sensitive to consumer pressure to do the<br>
right thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Only when a small minority obtain power through generally nasty means, can</i><br>
<i>&gt; they tell everybody else that these are the rules they must follow.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you equate the desire for a good life for all with central</i><br>
<i>&gt; planning. I hate and fear government just as much as you do. But I also</i><br>
<i>&gt; hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their</i><br>
<i>&gt; advertising and poison my water with their pollution. Uggh, there must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a better way than unrestrained capitalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Sorry, the USSR and East Block countries made much bigger messes of<br>
their environment than any western country ever did. You just don't hear<br>
abou them much because of the secrecy of those governments, and a media<br>
bias not wanting to make leftists look like bigger polluters than big<br>
bad capitalists.<br>
<p>
More environmental cleanups and preventions have happened in the west<br>
because business has become more responsive to consumer disgust with<br>
pollution. WHy? because business, more than ever, HAS to. The government<br>
approved monopolies like AT&amp;T, Cable, Elecrtic Utilities, etc. are no<br>
more, and industry must compete for public approval, or risk wholesale<br>
boycotts by consumers. This IS what a free market is about.<br>
<p>
Naturally, unrestrained capitalism is NOT the same as free market<br>
capitalism. Unrestrained capitalism is unresponsive to consumers (see<br>
what happened to IBM? Evolution in action).  Free Market capitalism is<br>
totally responsive to consumers. A free market also means there is room<br>
for private nonprofit type advocacy groups, like Greenpeace, etc.  THis<br>
has always been available in market economies, and not in socialist<br>
ones. You can go back to the early church, which provided services to<br>
the sick and poor when the feudal government would not.<br>
<p>
I highly recommend that rather than being a "sometime math student" that<br>
you make a full time study of economics before you come back here with<br>
your drivel.<br>
