<i>&gt;I think that another big problem with this surveilance technology is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it is so easy to forge video, and it's getting constantly easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt;With enough time and money you can make everybody do anything. How will</i><br>
<i>&gt;you ensure when something was taped, if it has been edited, morphed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;retouched or in any way altered. You only have to be avare of a camera</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make use of it in your own interrest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Will cameras cover every concievable angle? How many cameras would that</i><br>
<i>&gt;take? What would the storage reqirements be for that amont of video? How</i><br>
<i>&gt;do we verify the content?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we started to depend on video for justice/truce we would see so many</i><br>
<i>&gt;false examples that we wouldn't believe them anymore.</i><br>
<p>
I'd guess the usual reason for trusting such videos is that multiple<br>
independent sources verify the same results.  If you walk naked down a<br>
buzy city street, or assault someone there, enough independent videos<br>
may be taken of you to convince a jury you did it.  <br>
<p>
Also, there are likely to be some "official" video systems, where<br>
trust is generated by internal checks and balances within the<br>
organizations that run them.<br>
