<i>&gt;Well, if you lived on Cuba you would probably think it was reasonable. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Besides, I got the impression the results were rather inconclusive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My guess is that it is easier to influence systems with no strong </i><br>
<i>&gt;positive feedback loops, especially chaotic ones. Hurricanes seem to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;rather stable structures. Of course, if we can set up our own feedback </i><br>
<i>&gt;loops (as with algae blooms), then we can get interesting abilities.</i><br>
<p>
Are there any other methods we could use other than HAARP to heat portions<br>
of the atmosphere possibly less expensively? Also I heard long ago in<br>
california someone (I don't recall who) proposed installing huge fans in the<br>
mountains to blow smog out into the desert. Is that practical? Could it<br>
actually be accomplished? I'm not sure anyone in the desert would like it<br>
though.<br>
