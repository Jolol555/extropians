[Second try at sending -- using "lucifer.com" at David's suggestion ...]<br>
<p>
It so happens that my docket is dominated by life insurance marketing cases<br>
these days.  I was joking around with a couple of my partners last night<br>
about this subject (do we need to get a life, or what!?!).  We were<br>
commenting on the relative ease of life insurance _claims_ handling, compared<br>
with the challenges posed by claims on liability insurance: "Is the guy<br>
dead?" I asked, "Then pay the claim."  (Naturally, the issues _can_ be more<br>
complex than this.  See, e.g. "Double Indemnity".)<br>
<p>
But a real question is presented to cryonicists by this rhetorical question.<br>
 If cryonicists are right and "reanimation" lies in their future, then life<br>
insurance proceeds paid upon their "deanimation" might be at risk.  Will the<br>
Acme Life Insurance Company be entitled to recover policy death benefits upon<br>
reanimation, with interest?  Perhaps more chilling, might a life insurance<br>
adjuster be entitled to question the fact of death at the time the claim is<br>
made?<br>
<p>
In typical lawyerly fashion, I can see both sides of this question.  I could<br>
certainly argue with conviction for a rule of decision that would favor<br>
cryonics: "Death" means "death under the generally accepted medical standards<br>
at the time of ‘deanimation'".  But perhaps a word of caution is in order for<br>
those cryonicists who would avoid using the term "dead" to describe<br>
"cryonauts".<br>
<p>
Maybe there's a silver lining to the cloud imposed by this question: Perhaps<br>
life insurers could someday provide a source of funding for cryonics research<br>
if a _partial_ recovery of death benefits were agreed as part of the<br>
insurance contract for policyholders committed to suspension?<br>
