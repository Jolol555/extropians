Dr. Rich Artym writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Have a ponder about the Guy Fawkes scenario or about </i><br>
<i>&gt; total honeycombing of the Earth's crust with </i><br>
<i>&gt; communication, water and raw-material pipelines,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then try to deliver your message of "no major change".   </i><br>
<p>
Wait a minute.  This is equivocation.  No major change in what?  <br>
Our economic situation?  Of course honeycombing the earth <br>
would change our situation, just like the Erie Canal did, just like the <br>
construction of railroads did.  <br>
<p>
But honeycombing the earth would not change the economic system <br>
itself.  Any such project would take place *within* the economy.  <br>
Nor would it have any effect on the laws of economics.  <br>
Honeycombing the earth wouldn't change the laws of economics <br>
any more than it would change the laws of physics.  <br>
<p>
If you assert that Genies will exist, then that would imply a change <br>
in the economic system.  Genies amount to the same thing as slaves, <br>
and a slave-based economy does differ from a capitalist economy.  <br>
But even postulating Genies does not change the laws of economics.  <br>
A slave-based economy follows the same economic laws that apply <br>
in any other economy.   <br>
