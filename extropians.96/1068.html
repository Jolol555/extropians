Right.  All prices are relative.  Don't say "effectively zero price",<br>
say what price will be much smaller than what other price.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Molecular manufacturing will emerge within the same capitalist </i><br>
<i>&gt;economy that we live in now.  Factories will still be factories.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;They will require elaborate buildings and millions of dollars' worth of </i><br>
<i>&gt;specialized equipment.  They will employ biotechnologists with rare and </i><br>
<i>&gt;expensive skills.  Factories will still be owned by investors who want to </i><br>
<i>&gt;get their investment back.  They will produce products for the market, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and buy inputs from the market.  The managers will still understand the </i><br>
<i>&gt;concept of planned obsolescence.  </i><br>
<p>
This seems the simplest scenario to expect.  Things may go otherwise,<br>
but the burden is on those who think so to explain why we should<br>
agree.<br>
