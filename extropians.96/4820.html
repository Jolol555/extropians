<i>&gt; Here I totally agree with you. The schools in the US are far worse now than</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the majority of the people on this list went to them.</i><br>
<p>
I went to school in the 60's and 70's, and I have kids now in 6th and<br>
8th grade.  My wife was a high school teacher for about 4 years in the<br>
early 1980's.  So I have seen something of the school system in each of<br>
the last four decades.<br>
<p>
There are some changes for the worse, but some for the better as well.<br>
There seems to be more variation among individual teachers than among<br>
the school systems over the years.  My son had to do a report on Cuba<br>
in 6th grade; the assignment was to create an advertising brochure which<br>
would make people want to tour the island.  He did a nice job and got<br>
a strong A but it wasn't very hard.  On the other hand my daughter had<br>
to do a report on Greece last year, and had to go into a lot more detail<br>
about the culture, history, etc.  I recall doing a similar report on<br>
Ecuador when I was in 6th grade.  The difference is that my son's teacher<br>
did not ask as much from the students.  (It was his first year teaching,<br>
and he left after that one year.)<br>
<p>
Kids today have a lot more opportunities than when I was in school.<br>
We have high school kids taking courses at the local junior college<br>
during the day.  That was unheard of at my school.  More kids are taking<br>
AP classes, more are taking college entrance exams.  Things are more<br>
inclusive and more diverse.<br>
<p>
True, my kids are going to relatively good schools.  Things are of course<br>
a lot worse in the inner cities.  But schools have always been bad there.<br>
My wife student-taught at a school in a rough part of town in 1980.<br>
It was common for the students to set lockers on fire during the day;<br>
this happened several times each week.  Walking down the hall, past the<br>
shells of burned-out lockers, still black and (in some cases) smoking,<br>
you might have thought you were in a war zone.  Students would routinely<br>
skip class, parents didn't care, and it was generally not a place where<br>
much learning occured (the exception was the advanced classes, where<br>
the kids were highly motivated).<br>
<p>
Summing up, it is not really clear that schools are that much worse today<br>
than they were 10 or 20 years ago.  The problems may be more visible and<br>
our expectations higher.  While it is undoubtedly true that many of the<br>
underprivileged would benefit from better schools, my limited personal<br>
experience with their situation suggests that the poor home environment<br>
is a larger problem.<br>
