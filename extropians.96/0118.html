Some seem to think that The Prometheus Project is not needed and<br>
that  the conventional methods of freezing a brain we use now<br>
are all that is needed because Nanotechnology can always make<br>
any repairs that are required. I don't think  that is a valid<br>
reason for not supporting this project. We don't know how much <br>
damage the current methods of freezing cause to the brain,<br>
personally I think Nanotechnology probably has a good chance of<br>
repairing that damage, but I don't know that for a fact, and<br>
nobody knows how long it will take to develop Nanotechnology,<br>
and anyway "probably" is just not good enough. Think how<br>
embarrassing it will be if years from now we find that there was<br>
a simple way to preserve brains without damage and that method<br>
was within the means of late 20'th century technology, but we<br>
didn't find it because we didn't bother to look. A million<br>
dollars a year for 10 years may seem like a lot of money to us<br>
when we're begging for dollars, but it's peanuts compared to<br>
money spent on far less important health research projects. In<br>
spite of this it would be far, far, more money than was ever spent <br>
on brain preservation, the low hanging fruit has not been picked yet.<br>
<p>
Most people, myself included, thought that Nanotechnology or<br>
advanced genetic engineering would be needed to repair a spinal<br>
cord that had been severed, but now according to a recent report<br>
by Cheng, Olson, and Cao (July   26, 1996 Science) a simple<br>
surgical procedure may solve the problem, at least  it works in<br>
rats. In the same way, it's possible that Prometheus might find <br>
something much simpler than Nanotechnology that would get the<br>
job done, and  even if does not it will certainly find new<br>
knowledge for mankind that could  help us all. This is virgin<br>
intellectual territory, almost everything seen  will be new.<br>
