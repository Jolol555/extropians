It may be easier to use the intelligence to extract the resources<br>
from the system in the legitimate ways than to antagonize the<br>
whole world.  The system could rapidly develop superior alternatives<br>
to existing search engines, user agents, client programs, caching<br>
mechanisms; it could broker economic transactions on the online<br>
markets, etc.  It would gain much of the power of the on- and off-<br>
line world quite peacefully (isn't the technological system<br>
*already* metabolizing more energy, materials and information than<br>
naked humans?), avoid confrontation-related risks, have its power<br>
base expand, etc.   At some point, of course, humans would be too<br>
weak to offer much value or resistance, so hostile takeover of the<br>
rest of the world may make sense then.  But by that time, the<br>
"perversion" will own practically everything, and taking over the<br>
humans may be of little interest to it.<br>

Don't people already run the same cultures/opinions/languages ?<br>
<p>
How much of one's intelligence is really unique and personal?<br>
Ask people from the same culture about their individual differences;<br>
people from another culture will look at them as slight variations<br>
of the same memeset.<br>
Configurations of software on different personal computers may me<br>
more diverse than configurations of social skills, ontologies and<br>
belief systems of people with the same cultural background.<br>
<p>
It does look like a borg already. It's just not intelligent yet.<br>
Intelligence may come through increasing interconnectedness of the<br>
technological system and meme distribution channels, growth in<br>
reflective consciousness, from human-led research of large-scale<br>
structures to automatic data collection of data on them to<br>
adjustments of local actions based on global data.  All these things<br>
are already in place, and their intelligence as well as share of<br>
control over events keep growing.  Most people already have no clue<br>
about the most vital processes shaping the civilization - and that<br>
includes even those supposedly in the positions of great social<br>
power.  We just may wait a bit longer, and the peaceful transition<br>
of most real power to the "friendly perversion" will be complete...<br>
