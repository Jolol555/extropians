Chris Hind signals, "Ughh! I don't want to become a borganism."<br>
<p>
I don't think Chris has any problems with being a cyborg, so I am assuming he <br>
is expressing his distaste for becoming part of a collective.  Well, Chris, <br>
it's too late; you are already part of a collective (you are also the result <br>
of a collective; one which your cells are individual members).  <br>
<p>
Our minds are linked together, forming a larger mental system.  I don't mean <br>
this in a mystical way.  For example, when I talk to someone, my neural <br>
activity causes my throat to vibrate the air which alters the neural activity <br>
of the "other" person by vibrating their ear drums, which causes <br>
electrochemical stimulation in their brain, etc.  Our brains are not really <br>
separate from each other since they have developed many powerful links and can <br>
influence each other to a very high degree.  It's not much different than one <br>
cluster of neurons in one part of my brain influencing another cluster of <br>
neurons in another part of my brain.  Instead of the signals travelling <br>
through the axons and dendrites of my brain, they must pass through some other <br>
medium, such as sound waves or images or touching or something else, but we <br>
still have clusters of neurons sending signals to and highly influencing other <br>
clusters of neurons.  The fact that the different clusters are encased in <br>
different skulls is not very relevant; what matters, as far as the mind goes, <br>
is the *patterns of interaction*.  The different neural clusters can work <br>
together in a very coherent and intelligent way, such as in a group of people <br>
working on a project as small as washing dishes, or as large as a <br>
civilization.<br>
<p>
We are already part of a group mind, a collective, whether we're aware of it <br>
or not.  This thought is highy repugnant to many people, because they think <br>
that they must sacrifice their own identity, freedom, individuality, desires <br>
and so forth, for the benefit of the collective.  This response comes from <br>
people who automatically think in terms of zero-sum games; where one party <br>
must lose something for another to gain something.  In these terms, if <br>
something benefits the group, it must harm the members of the group.  However, <br>
in a positive-sum game, such as life, or the marketplace, several parties can <br>
all benefit together, with no loss to anyone.  The collective can grow <br>
stronger with no loss to the individuals -- in fact, for a truly stong and <br>
powerful collective, each individual member must *gain* from being part of the <br>
collective, otherwise it will be unstable.<br>
<p>
All our thoughts and exchanges of thoughts form the collective mind of <br>
humanity.  Examining the history of this mind, it seems to function most <br>
intelligently when each node (human) interacts voluntarily with other nodes, <br>
when there is a minimal amount of coercive activity among the nodes.  There <br>
are various reasons for this, which have been examined in more detail <br>
elsewhere.<br>
<p>
I believe that the most powerful collective will be one in which each member <br>
sacrifices nothing but gains tremendously by being in the collective, where <br>
the whole situation is 'win-win' for everyone, including the collective <br>
itself.<br>
