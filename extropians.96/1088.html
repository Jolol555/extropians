<p>
This may not be self-evident, but it's certainly the case that MNT<br>
"universal assemblers" can build most items with no input other than<br>
matter and energy. This is efficiently done by "re-tooling" as<br>
necessary, building tools to build tools to ultimately build the<br>
desired article. Clearly, building a one-off item will be a lot cheaper<br>
with MNT than without it. I believe the relative cost advantage of mass<br>
production over local custom production will almost disappear, even<br>
before transportation costs are considered.<br>
<p>
Transportation, on the other hand, requires an infrastructure that<br>
must be built and maintained at a cost in energy and matter. This<br>
overhead must be amortized over the cost of all goods to be transported.<br>
While it's true that MNT can revolutionize transportation, my gut<br>
feeling is that cost of transportation will exceed the differntial cost<br>
of local manufacture. Not very scientific, I admit, but I don't have<br>
time to do research to settle the question. You are free to assume the<br>
opposite, but without a working MNT example, all either of us have is<br>
an opinion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;That is, the differentials in production efficiencies that drive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the current economy will disappear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The current economy is *not* driven by raw physical production economy</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiencies.  There are also costs to retool for new products, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; invent products, to market them, etc.</i><br>
<p>
This atatement is not self-evident. Defend it. :-)<br>
<p>
Note also that "retooling" is almost intrinsic to MNT manufacturing.<br>
For many items, "inventing" and "marketing" may end up being handled<br>
informally, the way cooks trade recipes. This is tachnically an<br>
economic activity, but if that's all that's left, I still claim that<br>
the existing economy can be considered to have disappeared.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;With MNT, all I need to produce an item is the design for the item,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and matter, and energy. This means that any individual who so desires</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can drop out of the global economy and revert to a "subsistence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lifestyle" with material self-sufficiency.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the population explodes (such as with uploads) there may not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough land and sunlight for everyone to do this.  Or drop outs may</i><br>
<i>&gt; not have their property rights respected if their military technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; is far below par.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This looks more like politics than economics, but you are correct:<br>
MNT can permit a government or other group to impose any arbitrary<br>
condition on the populace. We may have to work hard to keep this<br>
from happening, perhaps by attempting to support the US constitution<br>
or by forming some other governmental system or association.What<br>
does this have to do with the effect of MNT on our current economy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;That lifestyle will be very lavish by today's standards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But it may be very poor compared to not dropping out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You and I could now go try to live as mountain men, after all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Which isn't a bad life by historical standards (now that even mountain</i><br>
<i>&gt; men can afford guns, flashlights, etc.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Correct, of course. However, I feel that the relative inefficiency<br>
of "drop-out" to "mainline" lifestyle will be much smaller with MNT.<br>
I'll spend esswentially zero time on the mechanics of living as a<br>
MNT drop-out. As a non-MNT mountain man, I'd spend a lot of time on<br>
making a living, I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I suppose that an economy in these three inputs (design info, matter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;energy) could in principle emerge, but not in time to avoid a complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;meltdown of the existing economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This all depends on the speed of change.  Why would it be that fast?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Why not? What will limit the speed of adoption of MNT? what will limit<br>
the rate of advance of MNT technology, given the obvious (to me, anyway)<br>
feedback mechanisms by which MNT will beget better MNT?<br>
<p>
The only limiting mechanism that I've been able to come up with is<br>
the economic disruption itself. Not pretty. It may result in the <br>
need to employ the aforementioned MNT subsistence scheme.<br>
