<i>&gt;      In all my dealings with others, I try to be as open and revealing of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; inner most thoughts as possible. I reject totally the idea that "white lies"</i><br>
<i>&gt; are OK. Furthermore, I have stated many times that my desire to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; communuicate with fidelity what I am is so great (and I seem not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplish this by standard interpersonal methods), that I would very much</i><br>
<i>&gt; welcome a human augmentation which would allow us all to transmit and receive</i><br>
<i>&gt; each others thoughts. I have stated that if such an augmentation were possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally better</i><br>
<i>&gt; world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever they</i><br>
<i>&gt; liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<p>
If I had a choice, right now, of having my memories broadcast over the<br>
entire planet or not, I would choose, without hesitation, to have them<br>
broadcast.<br>
If I had a choice, right now, of having my memory broadcast to a single<br>
human selected at random, I don't think I would take it.<br>
<p>
There are things in my mind that I would like everyone in the world to<br>
know, and things that I wish to keep to myself.  I would be willing to<br>
sacrifice my privacy - or, for that matter, my life - to let everyone on<br>
the planet know EVERYTHING I do in as much detail as I do.  I am not<br>
willing to sacrifice my privacy to give a single person that much; in<br>
fact, I would not give a randomly selected person ANY of the<br>
important/dangerous stuff, just Singularity-based ethics, evolutionary<br>
psychology and some of the cognitive science - not much more than I've<br>
already published/posted, although perhaps in much greater detail.<br>
<p>
Again, that disclaimer is there for a reason.<br>
<p>
It's a great question, though.  Would *you* want your memories broadcast<br>
all over the world?  To a million random people?  To a thousand?  To a<br>
single person?  To the readers of this list?  To the scientific<br>
population of the world?<br>
<p>
(Definitely yes, yes, no, definitely no, probably yes, and absolutely.)<br>
