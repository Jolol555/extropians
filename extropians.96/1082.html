<i>&gt;IAN: Of course the missile theory sounds like "anti-gravity"</i><br>

<p>
Nope, I didn't say missiles can't fly.  I was drawing a connection between<br>
two sensational but similarly unsubstantiated reports.<br>
<p>
For the record, I don't rule out the future possibility of an<br>
"anti-gravity" machine.  I just doubt it will suddenly appear out of<br>
nowhere.<br>

<i>&gt;It seems that over 100 crazy people had a spontaneous group</i><br>
<i>&gt;hallucination in New York on the night the plane went boom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Washington Times (07/24/96) reported about these crazies:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Several eyewitnesses, including an Air National</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Guard pilot flying in the area when the explosion</i><br>
<i>&gt;        occurred, have told the FBI they saw a bright,</i><br>
<i>&gt;        flare-like object streaking toward the jumbo jet</i><br>
<i>&gt;        seconds before it blew up. ABC News said yesterday</i><br>
<i>&gt;        that the investigators had more then  100  eyewitness</i><br>
<i>&gt;        accounts supporting the theory.       ^^^</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can you imagine that, 100 crazy conspiratorial people attacking</i><br>
<i>&gt;the truth-meme, which is that missiles can't fly or hit planes.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Untold thousands have reported hearing the voice of God or seeing the face<br>
of Jesus.  Truth-seekers must recognize situations in which wishful<br>
thinking plays a role.<br>
<p>
Besides, you can't believe everything you read in the newspapers or see on<br>
TV.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is more, there is a bad conspiratorial radar out there that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is also a dangerous threat to the truth-meme:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Associated Press 07/19/96</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         There were reports that radar detected a blip</i><br>
<i>&gt;         merging with the jet shortly before the explosion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         something that could indicate a missile hit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thank the truth-meme that some secret pentagon officials stopped the</i><br>
<i>&gt;testimony of that conspiratorial radar -- the AP story continues:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         But Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         anonymity, said government analysts have studied</i><br>
<i>&gt;         several radar reports of the area and the blip</i><br>
<i>&gt;         was found to be a spurious signal.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The same Associated Press cites a report there was a meaningful blip *and*<br>
an anonymous report that it was concluded to be a spurious signal.  Which<br>
should we believe?   The conclusion it was spurious was later included in a<br>
formal statement -- subjecting it to broader public scrutiny.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am glad we can rely on our secret govt agents to stand up for</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth when those bad "spurious" radars and witnesses get out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;hand and threaten the truth-meme.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, what you are really suggesting is a conspiracy between the entire<br>
government and the entire media to cover up the "truth."  However, neither<br>
of these institutions (in the U.S., at least) are as monolithic as you<br>
imagine.  Nor is the media (despite its many faults) merely a tool of the<br>
government.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;If true (I mean the missile story) it would be terrible news for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;extropians,  because it would suggest that the truth is a very weak meme.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IAN: Wow, this sort of says it all: If the missile theory is true,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then the truth-meme is weak. So it's preordained that there can only</i><br>
<i>&gt;be one variety of truth even if it's false, and that truth must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the a missile could never have hit TWA flight 800.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd say this line of reasoning is a threat to the truth. The only</i><br>
<i>&gt;"truth meme" is logical thinking. The only truth is what is.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We agree on the form of truth.  What we disagree over is your belief that<br>
only a handful of conspiracy theorists have access to its substance.<br>
