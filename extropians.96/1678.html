Alternatives to laws:<br>
<p>
I find it very inconvenient if I am physically attacked, murdered or <br>
if something of value to me is taken.  It would require a lot of <br>
personal effort to learn a martial art, secure my possesions or learn <br>
how to use a firearm.  What would suit me best is to hire somebody <br>
else to protect me (Private Protection Agencies).  This makes law and <br>
justice a commodity which can be traded in an open market place, <br>
thereby allowing it to evolve much faster.  <br>
<p>
Creating a commune of people who believe in the same laws and want <br>
the same sort of protection is also an alternative (just like <br>
countries now except a lot smaller, thereby satisfying _all_ the <br>
citizens, not just the majority).  How the interactions between these <br>
communes will be managed might still be a problem (trying to avoid <br>
the idea of a centrally controlling authority).  A mini UN might be a <br>
solution, although I intuitively don't like the concept. <br>
