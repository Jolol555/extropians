Here's a situation analogous to the shooting room where the probabilities are<br>
(I hope) more clear.  Suppose we have an atom with thirty six possible <br>
orientations, each with equal probability to be found (a made up quanton).  <br>
<i>&gt;From these atoms we're going to build inverted two-dimensional ziggurats.  </i><br>
Each layer will be contain a factor of ten times as many atoms as the one <br>
below it. (a factor of three in the figure below)<br>
<p>
<p>
    xxxxxxxxx	<br>
       xxx	<br>
	x<br>
<p>
We'll build layer by layer, and measure the orientation of the atom on the far<br>
right end of the layer after finishing a layer.  If we measure the 36th <br>
possible orientation for that atom, we'll stop building.  Suppose we have an<br>
infinite supply of these x atoms to build with.  Surely what orientation we<br>
measure has nothing to with how many atoms are left, or even the fact that <br>
we're building a funny looking object.<br>
