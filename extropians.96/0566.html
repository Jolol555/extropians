"Why is Asia Booming?" seems an oft-asked question, who various<br>
answers are taken as important clues about future trends and what it<br>
will take to prosper.  Here is a paper that suggests a very simple<br>
explanation.  <br>

     Ansley Coale and Edgar Hoover were right about Asia. Rising<br>
     fertility and declining infant mortality have had a profound<br>
     impact on Asian savings, investment and foreign capital<br>
     dependency since Coale and Hoover wrote in 1958. We argue<br>
     that much of the impressive rise in Asian savings rates<br>
     since the 1960s can be explained by the equally impressive<br>
     decline in youth dependency burdens; where Asia has kicked<br>
     the foreign capital dependence habit is where youth<br>
     dependency burdens have fallen most dramatically. Aging will<br>
     not diminish Japan's capacity to export capital in the next<br>
     century, but little of it will go to the rest of Asia since<br>
     the rest will become net capital exporters, at least if<br>
     demography is allowed to have its way. These conclusions<br>
     emerge from a model which rejects steady-state analysis in<br>
     favor of transition analysis and extends the conventional<br>
     focus of the dependency rate literature on savings to<br>
     investment and net capital flows.<br>
