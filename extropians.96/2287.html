Beware of that kind of invitation - now you might get a lot of people <br>
hunting your sacred cows. <br>
<p>
One obvious sacred cow you have seems to be that you don't have any; try <br>
imagining that you have views that you cannot question. <br>
<p>
As for extropian/transhuman sacred cows, there are of course the idea that<br>
things will get better in some sense in our future, and some see the<br>
Singularity or the utility of nanotech, uploading or AI as fundamental and<br>
unassailably true. Another dangerous sacred cow is the belief that we know<br>
what we are doing and are not a group of technophiles playing world<br>
saviours in our spare time. <br>

Sacred cows make the best hamburgers!<br>
