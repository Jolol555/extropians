In the recent cryptography thread somebody mentioned a single <br>
cryptoalgorithm, which was small/neat, even probably provably secure. <br>
I don't think that being small/neat are properties of good cryptoalgorithms. <br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
Assuming a symmetrical cryptosystem, the algorithm has to iteratively map <br>
a large seed, consisting of many binary/word sites. This is clearly a <br>
high-entropy Hamiltonian (rugged energy function), causing the system to <br>
execute a random walk in a (very) high-dimensional space. The larger the <br>
space, and the more dimensions there are, the lesser the probability of <br>
stepping on its own track (cycling) in the course of the random walk. <br>
Moreover, mapping should be extremely divergent, causing neighbour voxels,  <br>
wherever the sample is located, to diverge as soon as possible (not <br>
overdoing it, though).<br>
<p>
Clearly, a one-time pad would mean an explicit writeup of the Hamiltonian -- <br>
everything else would be just a short hand for it (it is obviously <br>
incollapsible). Here lies the crux: the code/data conglomerate is <br>
equivalent to an index, selecting one special from the multitude of all <br>
Hamiltonians. So I conjecture, a good algorithm, while containing very <br>
simple code, must contain any number of opaque, high-entropy tables to <br>
generate good random at all. Another conjecture: high-connectivity <br>
integer automata networks, defined by an high-entropy lookup-table (the <br>
larger, the better), especially those pseudorandomly changing <br>
connectivity of the network in course of the evolution should produce <br>
excellent, cryptosuitable pseudorandom -- even better, a whole family of <br>
good pseudorandom number generators.<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. I can't express myself properly, and one should prove several things <br>
about the above, but I feel strongly there is some truth to it.<br>
