Agreed. I was presupposing a supportive environment. <br>

The generic term would be 'willpower.' I think there's probably a better <br>
word and definition, but I'm not sure exactly what they'd be.<br>
<p>

<p>
Prudent, yes. But if the decision were either/or (and I strongly believe <br>
it would be both/and), I still might opt for the experiment.<br>
<p>
I'm going to go ahead and &lt;snip&gt; the rest of your posting, because I <br>
agree with most of it. I still haven't got the tone of my writings to <br>
match the tone of my voice. :-&gt; <br>
<p>
I don't want to say that I think striving toward a life of null-emotion <br>
would be a good thing, just that I wonder, sometimes, about the priority <br>
that it's given and why it's given that priority.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You seem to have already made up your mind about _that_. :) :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Welllllll, maybe. ;-&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This brings to mind a larger point, though. Considering the political and <br>
cultural difficulties transhumans now face (along with the peak of <br>
interest that occurs in adolescence), is there any chance of these ideas <br>
being supressed so totally they become a topic of history graduate <br>
students? If the Singapore model of capitalism takes over the world is <br>
there any way for 'post-primate' politics to gain a foothold?<br>
	<br>
My theory is that this won't happen on Earth. If anyone wants a <br>
transhuman life of null-emotion, in a protected and encouraging <br>
enviroment, they will have to be part of a complex diaspora of sister <br>
societies that might occur in mass extraterrestial colonization.<br>
