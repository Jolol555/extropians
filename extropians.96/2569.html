<i>&gt;To me, it makes more sense to have a dictator in power.  The method </i><br>
<i>&gt;of his ascension will not be voting, but rather becoming a leader </i><br>
<i>&gt;because of his success in the free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Leaders will autoevolve in a free market system, without the </i><br>
<i>&gt;artificial intervention of democracy.</i><br>
<p>
Dictators _do_ get alot accomplished and if you have a good dictator or<br>
king, the populous prospers. Interesting idea though about becoming a<br>
leader due to their success in the free market. Bill Gates for head of the<br>
country anyone? I would change this idea though to have the people vote on<br>
the leader who's the success in the free market because what if one of the<br>
possible leaders is an egotistical maniac or has strong racist feelings?<br>
Not everyone with $$ have brains. Some were just damn lucky. I do like this<br>
approach though. We just need to find some other title other than 'dictator'.<br>
