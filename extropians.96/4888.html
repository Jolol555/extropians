} &gt;those storage capacitors are always so bulky. Seriously, Eric, anyone<br>
} &gt;who refuses to go armed gets the repression they deserve. if you live in<br>
} &gt;that kind of neighborhood, not doing so is simple suicide in my book.<br>
<p>
I have the impression that in most areas, most urban ones at least,<br>
getting caught carrying a concealed weapon without a permit is rather<br>
illegal.  Such as a box cutter.  And in many areas getting such a permit<br>
-- or permission to have a gun at all -- is hard.  One could estimate<br>
the chance of running into a mugger in a situation where being invisibly<br>
armed was useful as being less than the chance of police finding one's<br>
gun somehow and getting upset.  And one could carefully live in a<br>
usually good neighborhood and still get caught by the rare mugger.<br>

"Perhaps you are thinking: "But a tank costs several million dollars,<br>
  not including floor mats. I don't have that kind of money."<br>
Don't be silly. You're a consumer, right? You have credit cards, right?<br>
Perhaps you are thinking: "Yes, but how am I going to pay the credit-card<br>
  company?"<br>
Don't be silly. You have a tank, right?" -- Dave Barry<br>
