<i>&gt;Okay, with logic and knowledge you can calculate outcomes.</i><br>

<p>
Nonsense.  It is a judgement based on knowledge, understanding, and logic.<br>
To say that our choices are just the result of some sort of innate reaction<br>
is to abdicate responsibility for them. What you call "value" (and link to<br>
emotion) I call general principle (and link to experience and reflection).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you encode values as well as knowledge into your premises, you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;effectively programming them into a computer.  If it works, then what</i><br>
<i>&gt;you've done is program emotions.  As I said, emotions are the logic of</i><br>
<i>&gt;values.</i><br>
<p>
A big -- and false -- leap.  Values =82 emotions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Values cannot come from understanding.  Only knowledge does</i><br>
<i>&gt;(except if you are talking about understanding values you already had).</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can't get values except from having them already, explicitly, implicitl=</i><br>
y,<br>
<i>&gt;tacitly, or built into your structure.  As they say, you can't derive</i><br>
<i>&gt;"ought" from "is."  But if you have values, and you're doing any thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;or information-processing in light of them, that's emotion.  That's all</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotion is.</i><br>
<p>
Gee, then how do people come to change their values?  My values today are<br>
very different from what they were twenty years ago.  And if you are<br>
correct, doesn't this mean that children (and even infants) have been<br>
imprinted with the values they will carry with them for their entire lives?<br>
I don't think so.<br>
<p>
In fact, while infants clearly have emotions, I'm not at all sure they have<br>
"values."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When people say that emotions are bad sources of information,</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I understand to be going on is this: one part of their value system</i><br>
<i>&gt;is telling me it doesn't like the urgings of other parts.  The person</i><br>
<i>&gt;is saying that they have conflicts within their value system.  The fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that some emotions claim not to be emotions is the result of a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;terrible ideas from our past.</i><br>
<p>
Above you said "You can't get values except from having them already."  Are<br>
you suggesting we are born with conflicting values?  If so, how do we<br>
resolve such conflicts?  When we choose between two conflicting (contrary?)<br>
values, what facility is it that we make use of?<br>
<p>
Emotions are indeed bad sources of information.  Perhaps we live in<br>
entirely different universes; when I look at people who rely on their<br>
emotions as sources of information, I see people whose lives are a mess --<br>
or worse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;An example of an emotion pretending not to be an emotion is when you said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "You are clearly better off if your premises come from understanding,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    ^^^^^^^^^^</i><br>
<i>&gt;    not emotion.  The same goes for values."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is "better off," if not a value, an emotion?  Without emotion you</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't care whether your premises lead to prosperity or ruin.  Without</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotion there is no "better."</i><br>
<p>
Again, this is nonsense.  Really, you are equating "emotion" with "truth."<br>
The fact that we recognize truth -- and do not need to trace its "premises"<br>
-- does not make it an emotion.  A =3D A is self-evident.  If you don't<br>
accept that, you will not be able to think or communicate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So I hope I've restored the peaceful smile on Bertrand Russell's face. :-)</i><br>
<p>
If you consider death a state of peaceful bliss, I guess so. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think what you are really saying is that, contrary to Bertrand Russell,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;emotions can be a good thing *if* they are tamed by reason and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;understanding.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;In that case, we agree.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would sort of agree.  Only in my view, reason is a *tool* that different</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotions *use* to work out ways of peacefully coexisting.  Same between</i><br>
<i>&gt;different people: reason is the negotiating method.  Saying that reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;"tames" emotion is like saying the internet "makes people friends".</i><br>
<p>
Reason is a tool.  But it is used by intellect, not emotions.<br>
<p>
And what about knowledge and understanding -- are those also just "tools"?<br>
<p>
Now the punchline: Think about how self-serving it would be if everything<br>
flowed from emotion.  Nothing would take precedence over self-indulgence.<br>
You would always be right.  If it feels good, do it.<br>
<p>
And why should two 40-something adults (I'm 43) debate anything.  We are<br>
each operating from values we "already" have.  We are both right, so we are<br>
never going to agree.<br>
<p>
I don't believe that, and I hope you don't either.<br>
