IAN: Talk about the "one size fits all" syndrome, how pathetic.<br>
Thanks for this example. I'm compiling info on DARE. Many studies<br>
have shown no effect to a negative effect, such that kids who take<br>
the DARE course are MORE inclined to use drugs. That's exactly what <br>
I predicted, the forbidden fruit syndrome. If you tell kids, "Don't<br>
go in that room...Don't go in that room..." where do you think <br>
they're going to go as soon as you leave them alone. "Gee what's<br>
all the fuss about, what's in that room, it must be something <br>
special. I've got to see..." I predicted that outcome and  <br>
wrote about a few years back on the internet -- I've <br>
got to try to dig that up. <br>
<p>
Now Clinton is talking about giving DARE more funding. You'd think <br>
they want people using more drugs, heck, the CIA's even running <br>
the drugs. Hmmmm... A mercantile govt drug running monopoly;<br>
economically and profitably, very logical indeed.<br>
