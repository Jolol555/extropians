I didn't know that there was an Extropian party line, Comrade Robbins. ;-)<br>

I agree. Though FTL travel  is disallowed in Relativity, it is possible that<br>
we might eventually find that Relativity applies only in certain situations;<br>
Relativity could take on a role similar to that of Newtonian mechanics today.<br>
