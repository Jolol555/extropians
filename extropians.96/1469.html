Much is being said, yet of little value. Sex appeared very early on the <br>
evolutionary theatre. Even the most primitive organisms have sex. I <br>
wouldn't count sex to traits that make us human, rather vice versa.<br>
<p>
That sex seems to mean so very much for us, is an artefact of evolution. <br>
Should replication, as it is to be expected, to become detached from  <br>
coitus, the act itself is going to become an atavism. <br>
<p>
A lovable atavism maybe, yet an atavism nontheless.<br>
