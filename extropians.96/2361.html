&lt;&lt;  Indeed it's true that the FDA and pharmaceutical<br>
 interests are seeking to restrict &amp; ban vitamins.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I work with (but not for) the FDA.  Both the FDA and pharmaceutical companies<br>
are (so far) inhibited from bans and certain types of restrictions on<br>
vitamins (nutritional supplements.)  Why?  Public pressure, political<br>
correctness.  <br>
<p>
The last time FDA was "talking" about more restrictions i.e. vitamins as<br>
having prescription drug status, they had their telephone lines clogged for<br>
weeks with irate citizens.  They backed down.<br>
<p>
Even restrictions on the new "cosmeceuticals" (the crossover of cosmetics and<br>
pharmaceuticals) was met with timidity by the FDA.  I went to 1996 Annual<br>
Scientific Seminar on Cosmeceutical Trends in LA .   Dr. John Bailey, Branch<br>
Chief Office of Cosmetics and Colors, FDA said no regulatory action will take<br>
place at this time.  They don't have a definition for this category (yet).<br>
<p>
The FDA usually reviews complaints first.  They have limited resources.  If<br>
they get complaints they will take action.  Sometimes on individual companies<br>
and sometimes on the whole industry.<br>
<p>
The "safety first" type on complaint gets their attention this usually<br>
involves adulteration and not complying with current good manufacturing<br>
practices (cGMP).  They want to make sure the consumer gets 3 mg (usually<br>
within a tolerance of 95-105%) when the package says 3 mg.  Also, the content<br>
uniformity and dissolution of solid tablets is tested.  There are many more<br>
things they can test for, but usually don't depending on the complaint.<br>
<p>
The FDA doesn't care to ban these products because of political pressure.<br>
 The pharmaceutical companies make money selling them but wished the<br>
non-pharm. companies would "play fair" and comply with cGMPs (just as the<br>
pharm. co. have to.)   So, I think false complaints are "generated" to get<br>
the FDA to investigate. <br>
<p>
Efficacy takes a back seat to the above testing especially after the new<br>
nutritional supplement and education act went into effect.  The United States<br>
Pharmacopeia (USP) 23 cGMP sections are  where the drug and nutritional<br>
supplement companies should look to keep FDA happy most of the time.  <br>
<p>
To me the FDA really doesn't care what is available to the public as long as<br>
they retain political correctness.   Remember when the law said all cosmetics<br>
must be tested in animals?  But the public balked at the idea of hurting<br>
rabbits.  The cosmetic companies I worked for said "We are going to<br>
discontinue animal testing"  and public pressure did not let the FDA enforce<br>
the law (so far).  BTW this does not mean the cosmetic companies do NO<br>
testing. . . they now test in humans instead  :-)<br>
