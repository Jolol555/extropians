<p>
A billion years seems too long.  Do you have a source re the actual<br>
temp vs. time curve?  And bacteria are lots hardier than Dinos.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The oldest undisputed fossils are a little over 3.5 billion years old ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Best estimate I've seen is that Eukaryotic cells evolved between 1.2 an 1.4  </i><br>
<i>&gt;billion years ago, well over 2 billion years after the first life. Well OK, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;remember reading a report somewhere about 1.6 billion, but I don't think </i><br>
<i>&gt;that's generally accepted.</i><br>
 <br>
My sources are pretty authoritive (see paper cites), and clearly say<br>
that Eukaryotic cells appeared about 1.8-2.0 bya (billion years ago),<br>
when the atmosphere became oxygen-dominated after all the ocean's iron<br>
was finally oxidized.  (Thus this was probably not a hard step.)  Such<br>
cells became lots more common though about 1.1 bya, apparently with<br>
the invention of sex (a good hard step candidate).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;For Great Filter issues, "hard" would be expected times of a trillion</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;years or more. An expected times 700my is far from hard enough to matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Obviously we have zero chance of finding anything a trillion years old, but I </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't think 700 million is a trivial percentage of life's 3.5 billion year </i><br>
<i>&gt;history.         </i><br>
<p>
I'm speaking of "trial and error" type steps, search across a flat<br>
fitness landscape.  If the expected time is a trillion years, the<br>
chance of it happening in a billion is one in a thousand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The really hard stages, I think, do not cluster near us in time.</i><br>
 <br>
Here I meant such trial and error steps, which can only go up.  Steps<br>
which can go up or down, such as mass descruction, can cluster in time. <br>
