} /Why is this "domination" (= great success in the market) to everyone's<br>
} /detriment. I don't agree. I think there's currently a good mix of very tough<br>
} <br>
} Well, I'm doing some development, and my employer agrees that the<br>
} Microsoft tools we're using are cruddy, but given the market demand we<br>
} can't just go off an write X programs under Unix which is what we'd all<br>
} rather do.<br>
} <br>
} The "best product" wins, but after reading Dawkins and "evolutionarily<br>
} stable strategies" I can put it this way: the best product is not<br>
} defined simply in absolute terms of price and performance.  In some<br>
} areas the best product is dependent on the other products in existence.<br>
} VHS vs. Betamax is the example usually offered at this stage.  A bad<br>
} standard can win because it is 'good' because it is standard.  We might<br>
} all (apart from Microsoft in this case) be better off with a different<br>
} standard, but we can't get there from here, even if we agreed on where<br>
} there was.<br>
} <br>
} /Do you really think the software market would function better if the<br>
} /government decided what products could be made, by whom, and how much they<br>
} <br>
} No.<br>
} <br>
} On the other hand, I am wondering (as of this moment) whether there<br>
} isn't a local extrema problem in the market as well as evolution.  THe<br>
} presence of intelligent components (us) alleviates things somewhat, but<br>
} in this case I'm picturing a big mass of people on a hill.  Individual<br>
} people can see a higher hill, but can't get there without the rest of<br>
} the people.  The whole mass of people acts as a blind idiot, and can't<br>
} get to another hill if it involves going down.  So the market stays on<br>
} MS hill.<br>
} <br>
} There might be a similar problem with libertarianism.  Most of us think<br>
} a pretty libertarian society would be better than the current society.<br>
} Even if this was true by the standards of most other people, it could be<br>
} that the stages between here and libertarian dominance are nasty.  And<br>
} as most people don't think of making huge jumps at once (rightly;<br>
} normally that is a bad idea) the Lib Party could be stuck even if more<br>
} people heard of and vaguely liked it.<br>
