<i>&gt;dropping self-transformation from the mnemonic set, but I'd hate to abandon</i><br>
<i>&gt;the idea entirely.</i><br>
<p>
I find four Principles to be a much less attractive number than five. I<br>
don't think you could do it in three, and that number might be TOO stable<br>
to be a symbol for ExI. A symbol like the current logo but with four arrows<br>
would be rigid-looking as well as swastika-like. Four bad. Five good.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I like "unlimited progress"... it's frank and to the point, &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Boundless enhancement" is okay, but I prefer the phrases</i><br>
<p>
I'm afraid I don't like these negated terms either. I didn't mention it<br>
before because no positive construction sprang to mind. This 'un' and<br>
'less' and 'in' stuff looks kind of childishly rebellious to me. I know<br>
it's harder to think of this stuff then to tear it down, but if you are<br>
going to redo the Principles so dramatically, I'm sure you're intending<br>
that they be better than they already are (I think they are good now, btw).<br>
