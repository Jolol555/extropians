Jeff Dee wrote 9/24/96: &lt;But what does 'tolerance of gray areas' mean?&gt;<br>
<p>
Good question.  I get the creeps any time I see the word "tolerance" any more.<br>
The word has been badly abused by the holier-than-thou politically correct<br>
brigades, who virtually always mean "intolerance" when they use it.  Likewise,<br>
when they say "inclusive," they mean "exclusive"; when they say "multicultural,"<br>
they mean "monocultural"; when they say "open-minded," they mean<br>
"closed-minded"; and when they say "diversity," they mean "perversity."  But I<br>
digress.  Really, tolerance in practice is simply indifference.  To tolerate<br>
something is to be indifferent to it, meaning it does not threaten your person<br>
or your way of life (which is nearly inseparable from your person) and holds no<br>
interest to you.  This indifference, when applied to other humans, can be<br>
miserable.  As Santayana pointed out: "[T]olerated people are never conciliated.<br>
They live on, but the aroma of their life is lost."  If something threatens your<br>
person or your way of life, no reasonable argument can be made that we should<br>
tolerate it, to roll over and let it have its way with you, without resorting to<br>
the fiction that the group is of higher worth than the individual.  Worth to<br>
who?<br>
<p>
Ira Brodsky wrote 9/23/96: &lt;Here in the People's Republic of Wilmette (Illinois)<br>
we constantly hear about the evils of "rigid facts" and "rote memorization" from<br>
public school teachers.  Meanwhile, our kids are not being taught to spell, they<br>
are not being taught basic math tables&gt;<br>
<p>
I commisserate.  Gray areas may be "tolerated" when they are of no consequence<br>
to you, but when they translate into the conceptually incoherent relativism<br>
being pumped into school children today, it would be irrational to "tolerate"<br>
them.<br>
<p>
Jeff again: &lt;Or does it simply mean 'acknowledging that there is a degree of<br>
uncertainty in all ideas, and dealing with that rationally'?&gt;<br>
<p>
It most certainly does not mean this, since many ideas are held with certainty,<br>
that is, not a shred of doubt to them.<br>
<p>
Jeff again: &lt;Certainty comes in all shades of grey from black to white.&gt;<br>
<p>
Oh no, not this error again!  This topic has been beaten to death on this list<br>
in the past, yet here it is again!  We must have reached St. Tipler's Omega<br>
Point already.  The distinction between certainty and uncertainty is digital.<br>
You are either certain or you are uncertain.  Look it up in the dictionary,<br>
certainty means indubitable, without doubt.  Now unless you propose that we all<br>
make up the meaning of words on the fly, to have dictionaries du jour, in which<br>
case we would be nearly unintelligible to each other, let's stick to the<br>
clarified meaning of certainty.  The instant you have a doubt about something,<br>
you are uncertain.  There are different degrees of doubt, therefore, there are<br>
different degrees of uncertainty, but there is only one degree of certainty.<br>
<p>
Sasha wrote 9/20/96: &lt;The more I think, the more I feel confused about<br>
everything.&gt;<br>
<p>
We've suspected this about you for some time now, Sasha... &lt;g&gt;  Your statement<br>
above is a good example of how "degrees of uncertainty" arise. One of Vico's<br>
axioms from his "New Science" (1744) was "...as men are naturally drawn to the<br>
pursuit of the true, their desire of it, when they cannot attain it, causes them<br>
to cling to the certain."  He wrote: "Men who do not know what is true of things<br>
take care to hold fast to what is certain, so that, if they cannot satisfy their<br>
intellects by knowledge ('scienza'), their wills at least may rest on<br>
consciousness ('coscienza')."  IOW, the more you think, the more uncertain you<br>
are, but the more you will, the more certain you are.  If you'd stop thinking so<br>
hard and start acting more, you'll be far less confused.<br>
<p>
Dejan Vucinic wrote 9/24/96: &lt;There are *no* fuzzy facts.  Instead, fuzziness<br>
itself may be a fact of measurement or observation.  Vagueness means lack of<br>
knowledge.  Inexactness means extensive knowledge about the scope of<br>
applicability of facts.  Truthfulness is yet another attribute, the most<br>
relevant of all mentioned to the word "fact."&gt;<br>
<p>
Ah, the voice of reason!  It is an exceedingly common error to mix up ontology<br>
with epistemology, with what is there, facts, with what we can know about them,<br>
our degrees of uncertainty, if you will.  Facts are facts, two things don't<br>
happen at the same moment, only one thing does.  We may see it dimly, or from<br>
different perspectives, but only one thing happens at any given instant of time.<br>
This applies to history, only one thing happened at each historical moment, not<br>
two or more.  Of course, I'm ignoring the solipsistic Many-Worlds nonsense.<br>
<p>
Dejan again: &lt;Is a rock more fundamental than number 1?&gt;<br>
<p>
Obviously.  Rocks preceded living entities capable of inventing the number 1,<br>
which only has existence inside the said entity's brainpan.  "There is no valid<br>
inference from mere possibility to matter of fact, or, in other words, from mere<br>
mathematics to concrete nature." - Alfred North Whitehead, co-author of<br>
"Principia Mathematica"<br>
<p>
Dejan again: &lt;So I must be out of this world since I'm spending months<br>
studying errors of measurement in order to publish a paper about some<br>
facts I measured in less than a week?&gt;<br>
<p>
On the face of it, yes.  Unless its part of some strange, esoteric initiation<br>
rite you have to pass in order to put food on your table.  &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
Robin Hanson wrote: &lt;If there is any sensible distinction between observation<br>
and experiment, it is in one's degree of control over a system.  Observers look,<br>
while experimenters change things (and look).&gt;<br>
<p>
I see there's been further discussion since this, on the nature of experiments,<br>
so I'll just add a tidbit about it.  I haven't seen the word "theory" come up<br>
yet, so let me say that an experiment can't be an experiment without a theory<br>
that not only predicts what will happen, but specifies what effects caused by<br>
the experiment will count as evidence, before the experiment is conducted.<br>
Observation, meaning no predictions are involved, still must have some theory<br>
behind it, or else what is to be recorded as having been observed?  This gets to<br>
the difficulty that the "soft" sciences have, as opposed to the "hard" sciences<br>
that do not deal with anything living, let alone conscious entities capable of<br>
theorizing themselves.  This difficulty is that theorizing about theorizing<br>
entities, characterized by their unique volitional freedom, enters a<br>
"meta-theorizing" regress, where what counts for evidence easily becomes fuzzy<br>
depending on the shifting purposes of the experimenters and their reviewers.<br>
Statistics are used because we are ignorant of the actual causes of the effects<br>
we are observing (again, epistemology versus ontology). Rules for statistical<br>
inference are set up strictly with utility in mind, which changes as the users<br>
of the experiment's evidence change their purposes.  Studies coming out of this<br>
domain, routinely are met with the question, "who funded this study?"<br>
<p>
Such mish-mashy characteristics of the "soft" sciences have given rise to the<br>
common and widespread charge that none of them are really "science," they are<br>
just political programs to varying degrees.  This charge must be taken<br>
seriously, because the "soft" sciences require funding, meaning they begin, and,<br>
of course, end, in the political processes of whatever society is conducting<br>
them.  Some political ends are better than others, e.g, the difference between<br>
using nonliving things as means to an end and using humans as means to an end.<br>
When statistics are applied to unique, individual humans, a mindset of viewing<br>
them as an aggregate object (as in the "hard" sciences), an undifferentiated<br>
mass, often develops; such a mindset is often passed on to corporate and<br>
political elites who then frequently use humans in a nonliving sense, as<br>
objects, as a means to their ends.  This is why the "soft" sciences have<br>
gathered both a good reputation, as in medicine, and a bad reputation, as in<br>
pschology.<br>
<p>
An interesting treatment of the problem of theorizing about theorizers, is in<br>
J.A. Scott Kelso's book "Dynamic Patterns" (1995) where he devoted a chapter to<br>
"intentional dynamics," trying to model a coupled human intentional-behavioral<br>
system, with mathematical predictions that, IMO, moved closer to the methods of<br>
the "hard" sciences, than many other "soft" science experiments I have come<br>
across, because the human subjects do not need to aggregated, they are<br>
self-contained experimental universes.<br>
