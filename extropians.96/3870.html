<i>&gt; &gt;You can't know that it's insane without knowing how soon I am likely to need</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cryopreservation and what alternative investments I can make with my time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not so! By being on this list and from your posts (also true for everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; here), is is clear that you greatly desire to continue to live to see and</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience the very exciting and mentally rewarding future that is strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggested by current developments and trends. Putting some significant amount</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ones income towards strengthening the "safety net" for ones life, is like</i><br>
<i>&gt; insuring against the ultimate catastrophy. A possibility whose consequence is</i><br>
<i>&gt; so important that it is virtually "imcomparable" with most other personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; desires. IMO, the decision to do all one can to save ones life (short of</i><br>
<i>&gt; harshly degrading it) is not open to relative weightings of how likely one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; to need the "safety net".</i><br>
<p>
What mystical nonsense.  This reminds me of the "if one life is saved,<br>
it will be worth it" arguments of the statists to justify encroachments<br>
into personal liberty without a proper cost/benefit analysis of the<br>
proposition in question.  "Values" exist, and can be compared, just as<br>
distance, time, and mass.  Arguments without specific measurement may<br>
have some rhetorical value, but to truly /understand/ and properly apply<br>
knowledge to one's actions, one must do the math.  It is useful to speak<br>
of 9.8 m/sec^2 as "the acceleration due to gravity", because the Earth<br>
is so much more massive than the everyday things we drop on it, and the<br>
heights from which we drop them so small, that it makes a convenient<br>
approximation.  But we can't land on the Moon if our only idea of the<br>
mass of the Earth is "so big it doesn't matter".  We need the numbers.<br>
<p>
Since "values" are a product of a volitional consciousness, they are<br>
necessarily personal.  I value good food, liberty, communication,<br>
money, and every other aspect of my life in amounts that I measure<br>
by how much I am willing to work for them.  If the price of Net<br>
access rises to a certain level, I will drop it; if the price of<br>
better access drops, I will upgrade.  Those /quantitative/ comparisons<br>
of values are no less valid for life itself than for any other value.<br>
I happen to value my own life very highly, and I rationally evaluate<br>
the odds of various techniques available to extend it or preserve it.<br>
I consider their cost, and make those personal decisions.  As it<br>
happens, I find that certain things like calorie restriction or use<br>
of "smart drugs" are irrational for me, because their cost/benefit<br>
fails under my values (the former because the cost in quality of life<br>
is too high, the latter because the benefit is too low).  But I do<br>
spend money on cryopreservation, because the value of a second life<br>
cycle weighed against the hours I must work for it, and the odds I<br>
calculate for its success pass the test.  The fact that I may not be<br>
able to put exact numbers on those values does not absolve me from<br>
characterizing them quantitatively and estimating the cost/benefit.<br>
<p>
But I do not concede that my values and their consequences must apply<br>
to everyone.  There are those for whom calorie restriction is no great<br>
sacrifice, and they should practice it to extend their lives.  There<br>
are also those who knowingly, willingly, evaluate the odds of dying<br>
in the next decade, and choose to take that risk for the benefit of<br>
saving the money they might otherwise spend on cryopreservation to<br>
spend later on it or something else.  I think that can be a perfectly<br>
rational evaluation.<br>
<p>
Anyone who thinks life is "beyond value" is abdicating reason no<br>
less than one who does not value it at all.<br>
