Yes, you guys are right, my post to the Thread in BrainTennis, was offensive <br>
in the way I said it.  However, I did that intentionally, and I _was_ <br>
expecting to get a lot of shit for it, which I did.  If that post was the last <br>
thing I was planning on writing there, then it would have been a bad move, but <br>
offending people, to a certain extent, has a way of engaging their minds and <br>
getting them to state their real concerns.  My intent was to offend, get <br>
people all excited, and then follow up with a few very nice posts, addressing <br>
their real concerns in a non-threatening way.  Basically saying the same <br>
things that I said before, but in a way that isn't so threatening.  <br>
<p>
I've had this approach done to me several times by my father, where I am <br>
offended and resistant to what he says, and then he follows up on what he said <br>
with more agreeable statements.  It is a very effective tactic.  Initially, it <br>
causes mental barriers to go up, and I am very resistent to what he says, but <br>
it also gets my mind highly engaged and thinking really hard about what he's <br>
saying, looking for flaws, looking for ways to argue, and I state these <br>
apparent flaws, often angrily at first, and he addresses my concerns in a very <br>
calm, reasonable, non-threatening way, and eventually, I see what he is <br>
saying, and it all makes so much sense!  Being offended has a very profound <br>
psycholoogical effect.  It has a way of making one CARE about the discussion, <br>
often passionately.  Of course, leaving other people offended is not a very <br>
good strategy, because then their mental barriers will just stay up.  There <br>
must be a period of "talking them down" from their offended stance, and if <br>
that is done successfully, the ideas will be embedded very deeply in their <br>
minds because they engaged so much of their minds by being offended in the <br>
first place.  It makes the discussion more interesting than a dry academic <br>
discussion because it engages their emotions.<br>
<p>
By, the way, this tactic can't be used to make people believe anything that <br>
they don't find rational; it just makes it so that when they do see the <br>
rationality in what you're saying, it will embed itself more deeply in their <br>
minds.  That's the point of the "talking them down" period; to show them that <br>
your ideas make sense.<br>
<p>
Although, one has to be careful not to offend too much, otherwise they won't <br>
listen to the rest of what you have to say.  But on-line forums are nice for <br>
that, because people don't feel nearly as threatened as they would if the same <br>
things were said in person.<br>
