I'm not a dualist, either inside the closet or out. However, there are one<br>
or two people I currently feel like challenging to a duel, so you might say<br>
I'm a duelist!<br>
<p>
My point was that each one of my ideas, values, and pieces of knowledge<br>
might continue on in many other people, but that would not mean that *I*<br>
would survive. I'm more than just the simple collection of bits of<br>
knowledge, or even knowledge + values + ideas. I'm an active, living person<br>
who contains all those pieces (plus dispositions, memories, abilities, and<br>
so on) interrelated in particular ways, in an integrated whole. If you<br>
separate those parts of me, and scatter them around a thousand people who<br>
then combine those parts in ways different from the way they were linked in<br>
my brain, then I have not survived. <br>
<p>
For me to survive, enough of the elements that make up my personality need<br>
to continue together, not just in isolated bits absorbed by entirely<br>
different individuals. (I say *enough* since I hold a notion of personal<br>
identity as a fuzzy thing, it's not binary, all or none.)<br>
