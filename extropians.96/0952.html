<i>                &gt;A DRAM cell needs 1 Transistor + 1 capacitor</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
In A CMOS transistor the voltage on the gate controls the current through              <br>
the device, the rod logic equivalent is the interlock, the movement of a<br>
rod is dependent on the position of a control rod. Drexler's interlocks <br>
are just two pyridazine rings, only 20 atoms for both. A CMOS logic gate  <br>
must have a large capacitor and that slows the signal down, it takes eons<br>
for the capacitor to charge up, A rod logic gate does not need anything like <br>
a capacitor so it has much less signal delay.  Drexler is designing for <br>
10^17 logic elements per cubic centimeter, I can't see why he can't make it.<br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;reasonable to think that if you multiplied 10 bits </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;by the number of synapses in the brain you could </i><br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;brain. It is no longer a reasonable assumption</i><br>
                        <br>
<i>                &gt;Why?</i><br>
<p>
                        <br>
Because after the January 28 1994 issue of Science by Madison and Schuman <br>
we know that the brain has a huge amount of redundancy, LTP spreads out. <br>
If you change the strength of one synapse you also change the strength of<br>
thousands of other ones, so they can't hold independent data. It's not<br>
like new values are being recalculated, the synapses are being crudely <br>
changed by the diffusion of nitric oxide produced by the original synapse.<br>
                                                       <br>

<i>                &gt;Can you expand a bit which energetic gains can be expected</i><br>
<i>                &gt;from them? [reversible logic circuits]</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Consider a computer with the smallest possible memory, just one bit. The<br>
computer could be in two states, zero and one. Now record something into the <br>
computers memory, for example one. You have reduced the states the machine<br>
can be in, from 2 to 1 in this case, and because the entropy of an object is <br>
the logarithm of the number of ways the parts of the object can be rearranged <br>
without changing its macroscopic attributes, that means you have reduced the <br>
Entropy of the machine too.<br>
      <br>
According to the second law of Thermodynamics you can locally reduce the <br>
Entropy of something but it takes energy to do it. The absolute minimum  <br>
energy it takes to erase one bit of information and record something different <br>
in its  place is  ln(2)kT , k is Boltzmann's  constant 1.381 X10^-23 J/K, and <br>
T is the temperature of the computer in degrees Kelvin. This is not a lot of<br>
energy by everyday standards, but it is free energy that must be dissipated<br>
as heat if you want to erase one bit of information. With reversible <br>
computing, that is where the output uniquely determines the input, nothing is <br>
erased in computation so you don't have this energy loss and a logical <br>
operation can be performed with an amount of energy that is arbitrarily close <br>
to zero.<br>
<p>
None of this is an important consideration to chip designers, today's  logic<br>
circuits are so huge, and they deal in such a tiny amount of information, <br>
that the effect is utterly trivial. Chip designers can safely ignore this, <br>
Nanotechnology engineers can not. In the early days there were some <br>
embarrassing incidences where people thought they were designing a nano <br>
computer, but when you looked closely at it and the amount of heat the thing <br>
would give off if operated at the design speed, you realized that what they <br>
were really designing was a first rate high explosive. They do a lot better<br>
now.                 <br>

<i>                           &gt;&gt;There is not the slightest doubt that quantum </i><br>
<i>                           &gt;&gt;cryptography works, and not just in the lab. </i><br>
<i>                           &gt;&gt;Recently two banks in Switzerland exchanged </i><br>
<i>                           &gt;&gt;financial </i><br>
                     <br>
<i>                &gt;Yes, but what does it offer, and which costs? Which advances </i><br>

<i>                &gt;with triggered (by stimulated emission) photon message </i><br>
<i>                &gt;spoofing, can it get detected in principle?</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
A message can be detected but NOT without you knowing it was detected, the <br>
idea is to use Quantum Cryptography to send a One Time Pad of numbers to the <br>
person you want to talk to. With a random One Time Pad you can generate a <br>
perfect encryption scheme, even if to everybody's surprise it turns out that <br>
P=NP, even if your opponent has a quantum computer, even if your opponent has <br>
a computer of infinite power, he can never read your message. Despite its <br>
perfect security it has severe practical limitations, how do you distribute <br>
the One Time Pad to the person you want to talk with? You can't send the pad <br>
electronically, if your electronic channel is not secure then an eavesdropper <br>
can tap your line and get a copy of the pad, if your channel is already <br>
secure then you don't need the pad. The only secure method is to  physically <br>
hand a disk with the pad on it to the person you want to talk to and then <br>
hand him another one when that one gets used up. That's not practical in most <br>
cases, certainly not for Crypto Anarchy in an economy based on anonymous <br>
electronic money.<br>
<p>
Public Key Cryptography solves the key distribution problem but at a (small) <br>
price, it is breakable in theory but probably not in practice. In a year or <br>
two it will be expensive but possible to break a 512 bit key, a 1024  bit key <br>
would be astronomically more difficult. Many users of PGP have a 2048 bit key, <br>
even with Nanotechnology there is not enough matter in the observable universe <br>
to make a machine that can break a key of that size before the heat death of <br>
the universe, or the Omega point whichever comes first. We can be absolutely <br>
certain that a 2048 key will never be broken.. unless..<br>
<p>
Unless somebody finds a way to improve existing factoring algorithms <br>
by a lot. An improvement of a measly few hundred trillion percent would by <br>
useless, I said a lot. This doesn't seem very likely, but it has not been  <br>
proven to be impossible. There is one other possibility.<br>
<p>
Unless Quantum Computers are possible and somebody actually manages to build <br>
one. (Such a machine would revolutionize the world so much that breaking your <br>
PGP key would probably be the last thing on your mind, but let's ignore that <br>
for now.) Would this mean the end of Crypto Anarchy? No, because we can use<br>
quantum mechanics on our side too, we can use Quantum Cryptography, and unlike <br>
Quantum Computers we know this will work because it's already been done. <br>
This is how:<br>
<p>
I send you a bunch of photons, each photon is polarized in one of 4 <br>
directions, horizontal, vertical, left-diagonal and right diagonal, - | \ / . <br>
In this example I send you 10 photons polarized as follows <br>
<i>| | / - - \ - | - / .</i><br>
<p>
You have a polarization detector, you can set your detector to measure the <br>
horizontal and vertical photons (+) OR you can set it to measure the <br>
left-diagonal and right diagonal photons (x). The laws of physics do not <br>
allow you to measure one photon both ways, because measuring one destroys all <br>
information about the other.<br>
<p>
You set your detector at random, let's say you set it to find rectilinear <br>
photons and let's say you have guessed correctly and it really is a <br>
rectilinear photon. If you can detect the photon after it passes through your <br>
polarized material, you will correctly deduce that it is a horizontal photon. <br>
If you can not detect a photon after it hits your polarizing material you <br>
will correctly deduce that the photon is vertical.<br>
<p>
What if you guessed incorrectly when you set your detector, what if you set <br>
it to detect a rectilinear photon but I send you a diagonal polarized photon? <br>
Then the photon will hit your polarizing material at a 45 degree angle so <br>
there is a 50% chance the photon will get through, a 50% chance it will not. <br>
In other words you get a random result.<br>
<p>
I send you 10 photons polarized as follows               | | / - - \ - | - /  <br>
At random you set your polarization detector as follows  x + + x x x + x + + <br>
So you might claim the photons were polarized as follows / | - \ / \ - / - |<br>
 <br>
Now you tell me over an insecure channel how you set your detector for each <br>
photon, Big Brother is free to listen in, it won't help him. I tell you over <br>
the same channel which settings on you polarization detector were correct, in <br>
this example settings number 2,6,7 and 9 were correct    * | * * * \ - * - *<br>
We only use those readings and junk the others, and we agree that horizontal <br>
and right diagonal photon means 1, and vertical and left diagonal means 0. <br>
So we have sent the number 0011 and we can be as certain as we want to be <br>
that there has been no eavesdropping.<br>
<p>
An eavesdropper can not know what type of photon is being sent, and just like <br>
you must guess what direction to set his polarization detector. He will be <br>
wrong 50% of the time and when he is he will change the polarization of the <br>
photon and give himself away.  We compare N bits in the string of numbers <br>
sent over an insecure channel, if there are no discrepancies then there is <br>
only one chance in 2^N that somebody is eavesdropping, so we can use the <br>
remaining bits as a one time pad. As I said this  has already been done and <br>
messages have been sent about 35 miles in this way.  I learned about this <br>
stuff mostly from Bruce Schneir's wonderful book  "Applied Cryptography".<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Your other post on QC has been very illuminating. Do you </i><br>
<i>                &gt;think these theoretical values are achievable in reality, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;without assuming unrealistically high demands on fabrication </i><br>
<i>                &gt;precision (structure geometry, alignment, etc?).</i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
I honestly don't know. A few years ago I would have laughed at the idea<br>
because it seemed that such a machine would need to operate with absolute<br>
precision and be completely isolated from the environment, and that is a <br>
ridiculous idea. When they started to find quantum error correcting codes I <br>
stopped laughing. Sometimes I think that at the last minute we'll find some <br>
law of Physics that will prevent a bizarrely counter intuitive object like a <br>
Quantum Computer from existing in the real world. On the other hand, the <br>
results from the last couple of years seem to point in the opposite direction.  <br>
We may know in a few years if this is really going to work or if we'll just <br>
have to settle for old fashioned Nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
Just how bizarre would this gadget be? If a Quantum Computer can produce <br>
meaningful output information from examining the quantum mechanical state of <br>
its memory, then there is no reason you couldn't run the machine in reverse, <br>
feed in information and change the quantum mechanical state of the memory in <br>
a meaningful way. In other words, a quantum mechanical matter manipulator that <br>
works at the atomic level or smaller. Yes I know its crazy but don't blame me, <br>
I didn't invent Quantum Mechanics.<br>
                         <br>
 <br>
<i>                              &gt;&gt;Just one cubic nanometer of diamond contains </i><br>
<i>                              &gt;&gt;exactly 176 carbon atoms.               </i><br>
                                        <br>
<i>                &gt;Yes, but how many operations/s can you gain from these atoms? </i><br>
<i>                &gt;How many bits can be stored in this volume? One bit? </i><br>
<i>                &gt;(probably much less).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nanotechnology by definition means the ability to control atoms at the atomic<br>
scale, if you can't store 176 bits in 176 atoms then you don't have<br>
Nanotechnology. I should add that there is no theoretical reason that you <br>
can't store more than one bit of information in one atom, a lot more, but <br>
Drexler is an old fashioned conservative sort and he makes no use of this <br>
fact in any of his designs.<br>
 <br>
How big would a rod logic nanocomputer need to be to equal the power of a <br>
modern mainframe? Drexler figures it would need to have about 150 billion <br>
atoms, a cube 1000 nanometers on a edge would do it, that's about as big as a <br>
mitochondrion. You could fit well over a thousand of such mainframes into a <br>
cell of average size.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Apropos picotech, see the post on femtotech I forwarded to</i><br>
<i>                &gt; the &gt;H list ;)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I remember hearing speculation about femtomachines that operated at a scale <br>
of 10^-15m . The idea was to build things with strangelet quark structures. <br>
Unfortunately I don't see how this could work, objects would not be rigid, <br>
and you can't build machines with a liquid. There is little more I can say on <br>
that subject because unlike nanotechnology, building things at this scale  <br>
would require a scientific breakthrough and they are inherently unpredictable.<br>
By the way, it's not very clear to anybody if a scientific breakthrough is<br>
needed to make  a Quantum  Computer or not.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Mechanosynthesis has not been shown to work.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We can do chemistry, and not just physics on atoms one at a time. In the <br>
June 16 1995 issue of Science it's shown that if electrons of the correct <br>
energy are shot at an atom from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope <br>
the atom will resonate and the resulting vibration will break the chemical <br>
bond. The procedure is somewhat faster than expected and does not require any <br>
exotic conditions such as very low temperature. J.W.Lyding, one of the authors <br>
of this report, is quoted as saying " We'd like to make small, electronic <br>
devices on the nanometer scale".  <br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;This is a problem. The defect threshold in the clone </i><br>
<i>                &gt;structure must not have _any_ negative impact on positioning </i><br>
<i>                &gt;tip accuracy. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Some error is acceptable because it would not be cumulative, such is the <br>
advantage of working in the digital domain, and Nanotechnology is certainly<br>
digital. You may need to build a rod 7 carbon atoms long, but you will never<br>
need to worry about a rod 7.01764513 carbon atoms long.<br>
                            <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The machine needs to build structures from the outside, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;not from within.</i><br>
                                                       <br>
Why? Neurons are machines and they can do it, but I like the idea of pre <br>
wiring lots of connections in 3 dimensions and then changing their weight. <br>
                            <br>
