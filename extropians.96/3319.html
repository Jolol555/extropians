<i>&gt;Let's not, shall we?  It is true that nanotech - or my own vehicle, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Singularity - would be able to completely fulfill almost any ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;wish imaginable. BUT. If we go around preaching nano-paradise, we will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be rightly regarded as loons.</i><br>
<p>
I was merely saying we should tell people what they 'want' to hear and work<br>
our memes in that way. People won't listen to someone not agreeing with<br>
them so make it sound as if you are agreeing with a bit of a twist. So far<br>
this is all on the drawing board so don't get the impression I'm going to<br>
instantly start walking around talking like an evangelist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the words of Drexler:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      "I would emphasize that I have been invited to give talks</i><br>
<i>&gt;      at places like the physical sciences colloquium series at</i><br>
<i>&gt;      IBM's main research center, at Xerox PARC, and so forth,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      so these ideas are being taken seriously by serious</i><br>
<i>&gt;      technical people, but it is a mixed reaction. You want that</i><br>
<i>&gt;      reaction to be as positive as possible, so I plead with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      everyone to PLEASE KEEP THE LEVEL OF CULTISHNESS AND</i><br>
<i>&gt;      BULLSHIT DOWN, and even to be rather restrained in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      talking about wild consequences, which are in fact true</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and technically defensible, because they don't sound that</i><br>
<i>&gt;      way. People need to have their thinking grow into</i><br>
<i>&gt;      longer-term consequences gradually; you don't begin</i><br>
<i>&gt;      there." [Emphasis mine.]</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps cultishness and bullshit is a natural part of any technology being<br>
implemented such as the complete bullshit the media says is virtual reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There's no better way to turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;into a bunch of parlor pinks, sipping coffee and planning the Revolution</i><br>
<i>&gt;without actually doing anything.</i><br>
<p>
I'm absolutely sure that the technology will continue with or without them.<br>
They can bullshit all they want but that isn't going to stop the technology<br>
just as the horrible examples the media calls virtual reality won't taint<br>
the image of good virtual reality when it debuts in a decent form for home use.<br>
