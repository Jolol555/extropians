Project:  I'm going to dig a tunnel and lay a pipeline  (or grow a tunnel <br>
with a pipeline in it)  from my back yard to the Saudi Arabian oil field, <br>
and pump the oil out.  This would seem to be beyond the capability of <br>
an individual.  <br>
<p>
But suppose I have at my command the Bechtel Corporation, IBM, <br>
Genentech, and Exxon.  I call the CEOs of these corporations into my <br>
office, and tell them:  "I am going to lay a pipeline to Saudi Arabia, <br>
as described in this spec."  At this point I pass out copies of the spec to <br>
each member of the group.  They read it attentively, then look back up <br>
at me.  I continue:  "Have a meeting among yourselves this afternoon <br>
to plan the work and assign specific tasks to each company.  Apply <br>
all your resources to this task, and have the pipeline completed by the <br>
end of next year."   They nod obediently.  <br>
<p>
The four CEOs have the meeting, as instructed, then go back to their <br>
respective companies, and start organizing themselves for their new <br>
task.  They may have to do a certain amount of retooling and retraining, <br>
since in the past they have worked on other things besides tunnels.  <br>
Bechtel and Exxon take the lead in this enterprise, since their line of <br>
work is the closest to laying pipe and pumping oil.  Even they have to <br>
do a certain amount of retooling and retraining.  The other companies <br>
have to completely reorient themselves.  IBM abandons all work on <br>
new system software, and reassigns their programmers to write software <br>
for the pipeline project.  They also relocate the company headquarters <br>
to Los Angeles.  Genentech contributes its expertise in biotechnology; <br>
it too has to abandon other projects to work on the pipeline.  <br>
<p>
All the companies throw themselves into this task a hundred percent, <br>
and they do in fact have the pipeline completed on schedule.  <br>
<p>
Do you see anything implausible in this scenario?  <br>
<p>
Now, suppose there are mite-sized humans (or mite-sized robots with <br>
human intelligence).  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the <br>
mite-people and the employees of the corporations discussed above.  <br>
They have the same capability, on their level, that IBM, Exxon, etc.  <br>
have on our level.  They have equivalent tools, the same ability to <br>
acquire or invent new tools, similar computers, the same access to <br>
outside consultants and subcontractors, the same corporate organization, <br>
everything.  They are clones of IBM, Exxon, Bechtel, and Genentech.    <br>
<p>
Let's go through the same scenario again, except this time I am not <br>
addressing CEOs of my own size, I am addressing mite-sized CEOs.  <br>
I give them the same instructions as above, in the same peremptory <br>
tone, with the same result.  (In this case Genentech and IBM may play a <br>
more prominent role than they did in scenario #1.)  <br>
<p>
Is scenario #2 more plausible than #1?   Why?  Why would a mite-sized <br>
Exxon take orders from me, when the actual Exxon wouldn't?  <br>
<p>
If they were even smaller than mite-size, would that make it any more <br>
plausible?  <br>
<p>
Let's define a  Genie as an entity with at-least-human intelligence and <br>
sensorimotor ability, who works for free.   (This is distinguished from a <br>
genie machine, which is defined as an entity that can make whatever <br>
it is told to make.  A Genie is not necessarily a genie machine, and vice <br>
versa.)  <br>
<p>
Nanotechnologists assume that Genies will exist.  That's what <br>
distinguishes Drexlerian Nanotechnology from ordinary technology.  <br>
Size isn't really the point here.  Drexler's "dizzying prospect" <br>
doesn't depend on moving atoms one by one -- that's a red herring.  <br>
What makes the prospect dizzying is the idea that entities with <br>
at-least-human intelligence will do our bidding.  <br>
<p>
Without Genies, the ability to move atoms individually is just an <br>
extension of present-day technology, not dizzying at all.  <br>
Molecular manufacturing without Genies is just agribusiness.  <br>
<p>
There are no Genies and never will be.  I'm not saying AI will never <br>
exist.  What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter:  any entity with <br>
at-least-human intelligence (artificial or not) won't work for free.  <br>
<p>
Therefore Strong Nanotechnology will not exist.  By Strong Nanotech, <br>
I mean for example the scenario described by Rich Artym:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just to bring it really home, if a person can program a nanosystem </i><br>
<i>&gt; to create (say) a saltwater pipeline which extends itself a short distance </i><br>
<i>&gt; into the rock under his property, he or she can in principle </i><br>
<i>&gt; create a pipeline extending into the nearest ocean, WITHOUT</i><br>
<i>&gt; requiring any extra capital or manpower or any other resources.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such power in the hands of everyman completely destroys </i><br>
<i>&gt; the basis of our current economy, which is founded on the maxim </i><br>
<i>&gt; that it is more or less impossible for any single person to do </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything major in a material sense by him/herself, needing to </i><br>
<i>&gt; *purchase* everything, which keeps the economy rolling and </i><br>
<i>&gt; allows governments to reel in taxes.</i><br>
<p>
Consider the expression "program a nanosystem."  This is equivalent to <br>
giving orders to the CEO of Bechtel, and having him jump at your <br>
command.  In other words, to "program a nanosystem" is to give orders <br>
to a Genie.   This is not going to happen.  I'm not saying that <br>
nanosystems will not exist, nor that they will not be able to create <br>
pipelines.   I'm saying that a nanosystem (or any system) capable of <br>
creating a pipeline will contain many human-level intelligences, <br>
and they will not be at your command.   Not unless you pay them.  <br>
