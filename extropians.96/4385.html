This e-mail is designed to be seductive.  It is designed to be <br>
manipulative.  It is designed to be subversive.  It is designed to be<br>
revolutionary.  It is designed to be handled with care.<br>
<p>
Here are some things to think about: copyright law in the digital age;<br>
encryption; communication decency; national security; global security;<br>
constructive positive debates; consensus building; technology<br>
transfer; global electronic commerce; and a world of problems with<br>
solutions that already exist.<br>
<p>
IT IS TIME that the potential threats to individual health and values<br>
be identified, respected, and contained for purposes of survival.<br>
<p>
THE SAFETY NET is a trap.  The Internet is the biggest risk human kind<br>
has ever taken.  The potential for abuse is tremendous, and very<br>
immediate.  There are simply too many secrets that are available to<br>
too many unqualified and irresponsible people.<br>
<p>
The process of the resolution of these complex conflicts is a <br>
function of the quality and efficiency of human communication.<br>
<p>
Generally, humans communicate most effectively when assembled as a<br>
team alligned against an obstacle.<br>
<p>
If you wish, let this be an example of an obstacle.<br>
