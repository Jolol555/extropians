Sarah Marrs wrote 9/28/96: &lt;Congratulations. I think you've won a prize for the<br>
most unpleasant and ad feminam comment I've ever read on this or the &gt;H list.&gt;<br>
<p>
I couldn't find "ad feminam" in my dictionary.  Is it a Latin derivative?  You<br>
called yourself a "gal," am I supposed to not pick on you?  You want a break?  I<br>
don't take gender claims seriously on the Net.  Maybe if I meet you, I'll be<br>
more chivalrous.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;My experience of this list is that people always speak out if the disagree<br>
with something, but don't if they simply agree. So I would have interpreted a<br>
lack of responses to my original mail as agreement by the list, not disagreement<br>
(and hence disagreement with you).&gt;<br>
<p>
Thank you for sharing your experience.  What a convenient and<br>
self-congratulatory interpretation.  I see that with a worldview of relative<br>
truth and mythological history, that truth must be decided by a popularity<br>
contest.  Just pick the right mailing list with like-minded individuals, and<br>
almost anything could be true.  In my experience with the list, oftentimes posts<br>
don't generate responses because nonsensical things are claimed in the post, and<br>
many individuals know the proverb about not arguing with fools, because others<br>
may not be able to tell the difference.  Hmm...<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;Where did I, or you, mention contradicatory events? Where did I, or you,<br>
mention the same place? What, in short, are you talking about?&gt;<br>
<p>
You invoked quantum physics at the Planck scales in the context of events<br>
occurring in space-time.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;I just tried to explain what toleration actually is: no judgement call.&gt;<br>
<p>
Nonsense, we judge all the time, some of us are more honest about it.  To<br>
tolerate someone's intentions or actions means we've judged them to be<br>
unimportant.  Beneath us.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;I base the answers to these questions on feelings, so you wouldn't accept<br>
them anyway.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't "feel" that I would accept them, no.  Now if you wanted to find some<br>
ground underneath the feelings, something connected to rational thought, I would<br>
be interested.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;You're confusing the feelings which _are_ tolerance and intolerance with<br>
feelings _about_ tolerance and intolerance.&gt;<br>
<p>
Feelings are confusing.  That's why I prefer thinking, clarity and certainty are<br>
more adaptive than mush.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;An individual's feelings include tolerance and intolerance...&gt;<br>
<p>
Tolerance is not a "feeling," but a virtue.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;Personally, however, I don't attach such value judgements to tolerance or<br>
intolerance: i.e. I would not make a blanket statement that tolerance is<br>
good. I choose to tolerate some things, and not tolerate others.&gt;<br>
<p>
Do you throw dice to choose?  Spin arrows?  Consult the Ouija board?  Call the<br>
Psychic Hot-Line?<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;But my balance would place diversity above being destroyed, so I<br>
wouldn't be in that situation.&gt;<br>
<p>
You would rather be destroyed than dishonor diversity?  What a funny "feeling."<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;So it is those listening who change human ideals, not those talking.&gt;<br>
<p>
Passivity is passivity, not change.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;So what was the theory that Brown had when he observed Brownian motion for<br>
the first time?&gt;<br>
<p>
How did Brown recognize what he was observing without theoretically categorizing<br>
it?<br>
