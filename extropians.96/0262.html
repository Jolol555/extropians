Well, there are some reasons for even a solid state-civilization to <br>
expand. Computing resources will always be limited, and judging from how <br>
we fill up disk space and reproduce I have no doubt that there will be a <br>
demand for more nanoprocessors and energy. And living on a single planet <br>
is dangerous - a large asteroid impact is just as deadly for an upload <br>
civilization as for our.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thus I think there's an good chance we'll become transcendent post-</i><br>

<i>&gt; activities within our solar system.</i><br>
<p>
This is possible, but very dangerous. It seems likely that transcendence <br>
will involve potentially devastating technologies and runaway processes - <br>
it is a good idea to spread the risks (frankly, I'm not going to stay <br>
around when God's Lightening get their hands on assemblers). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This leads to some interesting consequences: if only a portion of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mankind transcends, they might leave enough advanced artifacts</i><br>
<i>&gt; around for the remainder to do the major physical engineering projects</i><br>
<i>&gt; to explore and colonize space. Maybe all those UFO's are full of</i><br>
<i>&gt; alien idiots who couldn't transcend along with their fellows.</i><br>
<p>
:-) It might even occur several times, as the conservatives transcend in <br>
a second singularity, leaving the arch-conservatives, until we get a <br>
mixture of idiots, conservatives and religious fanatics. Maybe the UFO's <br>
are interstellar Jehova's Witnesses knocking on our door? :-)<br>
