<i>&gt;I agreed with your post , some form of D.O is included</i><br>
<i>&gt;in well thought out philosophies (dragging in Carlos</i><br>
<i>&gt;Casteneda confused me a bit because from what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have heard from Casteneda people, there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mysticism and magic, something about hidden doors,</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality not being real, and energy leaks throughout the</i><br>
<i>&gt;body- ie: a whole lot of mumbo jumbo that I could</i><br>
<i>&gt;hardly follow; - )</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm.  It's been nearly 20 years since I read Castaneda.  It seemed obvious<br>
to me at the time that stuff was not intended to be taken literally.  I<br>
guess I'm not that surprised other people took it literally, though.<br>
<p>
I think of Carlos Castaneda as industrial-strength est.  Unfortunately,<br>
that's what I needed at the time.  The message I got wasn't "reality isn't<br>
real" -- it was more like "your perceptions of reality aren't reality."<br>
Nothing mystical about that.<br>
<p>
As I recall, the first book was an entertaining but somewhat tedious<br>
description of drug-induced hallucinations.  The lesson I derived from that<br>
was very simple: chemicals can change your perceptions.  Therefore, don't<br>
always be so certain things are exactly as they appear to you.  Your body<br>
produces and regulates its own set of chemicals.<br>
<p>
The other thing I remember is the Mexican indian (Don Juan?) teaching<br>
Carlos to learn to control his dreams and even his waking thoughts.  With<br>
practice, I learned to see my own hand in my dreams.  I also learned to<br>
stop analyzing situations that just required *doing*.  The lesson I learned<br>
was that you can acquire what previously seemed like mystical powers, if<br>
only you abandon the belief that reality is exactly as you perceive it.<br>
Actually, I turned this around, and used it to get other people to perceive<br>
*me* differently.  Same principle; no mysticism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Most people miss those opportunities because they err on the side of</i><br>
<i>&gt;skepticism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here I agree with the premise... but...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The thing I would change: is say, rather than skepticism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"err on the side of *pessimism* " OR err by</i><br>
<i>&gt;"beating one's self up".</i><br>
<p>
Very good point.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Skepticism and optimism work REALLY well together.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A good dose of both and one will avoid many pitfalls.</i><br>
<p>
You have just taught an old dog a new trick...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The true skeptic is open minded. I know that cynics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;skeptics look much the same, but it is a totally different</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind set ; )</i><br>
<p>
But cynics often like to masquerade as skeptics.<br>
<p>
Oh well, back to real reality. &lt;g&gt;<br>
