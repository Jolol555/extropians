	However much we may dislike the tyrannical aspects of governments, they still <br>
are a form of Spontaneous Order.  Our rational thinking and our intentions are <br>
not supernaturally outside the realm of evolution and spontaneous order.  Our <br>
rationality comes from the spontaneous ordering of trillions of nerve cells in <br>
our bodies and from the incredibly complex interaction, competition, evolution <br>
and spontaneous ordering of memes which compose our minds.  Our societies and <br>
governments emerge from similar processes of evolution and spontaneous <br>
ordering.  NOTHING (as far as I know) lies outside this arena of evolution and <br>
spontaneous order.  The libertarian memes will hopefully outcompete the <br>
authoritarian memes, and the amount of coercive behavior would then decrease.  <br>
But we always have been, are, and always will, exist in a system of evolution <br>
and spontaneous order.  Just because we intentionally create something, <br>
doesn't mean it is not spontaneous order.  All our intentions are the results <br>
of incredible spontaneous order; we're not somehow magically outside the <br>
system.<br>
	Our rationality is not some pure and holy faculty, issued forth from God.  It <br>
is the result of intense genetic and memetic competition.  The memes which are <br>
the most durable and successful in the memetic competition and evolution are <br>
simply the ones that we label "rational".  Rationality is the most trustworthy <br>
of our faculties, simply because the memes which are "rational" are the ones <br>
which have out-competed all the competition....so far, anyway.  Rationality is <br>
not the pure thing that some people make it out to be.  It's a very haphazard <br>
and chaotic process.  But rationality is all the best and most competitive <br>
ideas we've come up with so far, so it deserves our praise.  It is not some <br>
dead and dry academic faculty either; it is at the forefront of evolution; it <br>
is that which has triumphed over all competitors so far.  Rationality is, I <br>
would say, the most vibrant, living and the most likely to *continue* living <br>
aspect of existence, simply because it is the best of the best at any given <br>
moment.  <br>
	The systems which survive the best are the ones which are the most responsive <br>
and adapted to their reality.  Thus, I would say that the systems which <br>
survive the best could be considered to be the most rational.<br>
	<br>
Our thoughts evolve, and "we" have no control over them.  "We" ARE the <br>
evolving thoughts.  If the thoughts are competitive enough, they'll survive; <br>
if not, they won't.  The system will play itself out.  No one is in control.  <br>
And no one ever can be.  That's just how things are.  It kinda blows the <br>
mind...<br>
