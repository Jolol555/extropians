<i>&gt;&gt; So, what can we do to prevent ourselves from being destroyed? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wait a minute -- destroyed?  Just because an entity is more powerful </i><br>
<i>&gt;and intelligent than humans doesn't mean it's going to set out to destroy </i><br>
<i>&gt;us.  Sun Microsystems is way more intelligent and powerful than I am, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but I don't consider it a threat to my existence.  </i><br>
<p>
To prevent being destroyed the dominant being must be much more intelligent<br>
than the other being so as to be out of the range of competition. An<br>
example of this would be say you have three brothers, two brothers are born<br>
1 year apart from the other while the third brother is five years apart<br>
from the second brother. There will be more cut-throat competition between<br>
the two brothers born 1 year apart than the brother born five years away<br>
from the other two. See my point?<br>
