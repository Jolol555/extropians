<i>&gt; &gt;  If you're willing to stop some innocent programs, complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; verification is easy.  And since no Java compiler that I know of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; produces secure but (currently) unverifiable code, there's no problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see -- so 'exec "rm -rf $HOME/*"' (or the whatever the Java equivalent</i><br>
<i>&gt; is) will produce verifiable code but delete all my files. How useful. </i><br>
<p>
The Java bytecode verifier ensures that no object references are forged,<br>
so that no area of computer memory can be accessed unless allocated, by<br>
the Java environment, as an object.  Java code is not assembly language<br>
that executes directly on the computer; it is a set of interpreted<br>
bytecodes, in which there are no pointers, only "object references"<br>
which cannot be forged by any set of bytecodes which passes the<br>
verifier, and which can be created only by the Java equivalent of an OS,<br>
which is prewritten for your computer and which is not loaded over the<br>
net.  Java *applications* *may* be allowed to access pre-written (not<br>
net-loaded) native methods for executing commands such as "rm -rf<br>
$HOME", but Java *applets*, which are loaded automatically, can't do<br>
that.<br>
<p>
Java is a virtual world.  The bytecode verifier ensures that the Java<br>
bytecodes stay within the virtual world.  There are no halting problems<br>
here.  The basic Java model is, mathematically speaking, completely<br>
secure.  In point of fact, if Java wasn't secure, *then* I could write a<br>
Turing machine capable of solving the halting problem.  There may be<br>
flaws in the implementation, but I think that your challenges here are<br>
based on a lack of knowledge.<br>
<p>
If you have more questions about Java, I suggest you consult a FAQ or<br>
Sun's Web site.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oops. You just rejected 'JavaDoom' -- three million people disabled their </i><br>
<i>&gt; verifiers immediately.</i><br>
"While you've been making better idiot-proof mechanisms, God is out<br>
there making better idiots."<br>
