To EVERYONE:<br>
<p>
Thanks again for all the input on my website.<br>
<p>
As for the problem with the link settings (that nasty neon blue on the<br>
wood background), they are all custom set to a red for unused and dark<br>
tan for used, which should be a little darker than the light tan text.<br>
If any of you are still getting that  blue color (which IS annoying, I<br>
just saw it this eve on my sister's machine), it is due to your browser<br>
imposing its own default settings on incoming links. You can fix this by<br>
going to the General Preferences section of the Options menu on your<br>
browser and changing the settings to allow incoming pages to choose<br>
their own colors.<br>
<p>
If anyone still gets that nasty blue color on my links, please let me<br>
know so I can investigate further.<br>
<p>
Thanks to Chris Hind and Natasha More for putting up links to my site<br>
in  reciprocation for my links to them. If anyone else would like<br>
similar mutual links please let me know.<br>
<p>
I now have music on all pages, courtesy LiveUpdate's Crescendo plug-in<br>
(shameless commercial plug), which I recommend anyone who would like<br>
music with their pages to get via the links on my front page. My music<br>
is currently only available to Netscape users with the plugin. Explorer<br>
users will be able to enjoy it next week or so, when I change the<br>
coding. <br>
<p>
I'll have the MONEA (My Own Nuclear Espionage Agency) area finished this<br>
week, with registration available to all would be agents.<br>
