<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; an agreeable trade, much like a free lance artist does.  It will become less</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; necessary to have a "steady job", where one trades with the same person day</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; after day, and it will become easier and more secure for someone to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; several clients that they work for and multiple streams of income, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; not dependent on any single source of income.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I myself have worked that way, and your theory has some flaws. Those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;makes the most money are usually close conncted to a single company.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Those i know who are not, spend to much time trying to sell their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;skills. (And most of them don't like that part of their job. They wish</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;they could have a sales force.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And that's where technical consulting/recruiting firms come in.  (And also</i><br>
<i>&gt; where some of the *real*  money is...).  It is becoming common for</i><br>
<i>&gt; independant freelancers to band together to form consulting</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies/groups/associations.  You get more exposure that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You are right that there will no longer be technical reasons why an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;individual shouldn't be able to compete with huge corporation. And it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;will also happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the software industry, this is already happening.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If one person with a high level of skills makes a difference, then many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;high skilled workers  cooperating will make more of a difference. At my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;current job (a media an marketing company) we are not cheap. Our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;costumers know that. They also know that we are a group of talented</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;individuals with a strong background in as diverse areas as marketing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;video produktion, distribution.... all the things a large corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;need to sell and comunicate their services and products. Still they use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;us because we can do something that an individual cannot. (we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;redundancy in our system for one thing, making us safer.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Instead of using us they could use individual subcontractors. But for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;every two or three subcontractors they would need somebody to keep an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;eye out on them. (Most people are note that talented and ned to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;supervised closely not to make bad desicions.) There will then be no net</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;profitt. just more FUD than if they chosed a *professional* solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; One could first hire a team</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of engineers to plan the project and organize it into sub-projects.  Then one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; could hire teams and individuals to complete the various sub-projects until</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the greenhouses are built and food is being grown in them.  Then one would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; receive requests for food and hire people to transport the food to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; appropriate places.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This would all take a lot of money. A person with a lot of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wouldn't he hire e secretary to do the boring bits? Already there we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on the way from the single man comapny.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As an individuals business presence grows, it is inevitable that they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; start to coalesce something resembling a company.  It is unavoidable if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to maintain economic growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Now it's becoming a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; lot easier for the average person to do, because computer networks are</i><br>
<i>&gt; helping</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; to lower the costs of organizing a business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Large scale projects can still only be done by large groups with a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It will always require a lot of money, but increasingly, it can be done with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cooperation of independant developers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I predict that it will become increasingly less common</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; for someone to have a "steady job".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Probably it will be more in the direction of people working at home for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2-3 days a week. While they are still in a steady job.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; it will seem foolish and dangerous to have only one major client</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; that one is dependent on for income.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But a lot easyer than looking for work all the time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; As a project manager, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; may find someone who consistently does excellent work, and you may hire them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; regularly to work on various projects, and this will probably be common.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; that same person will likely have many other clients that they work for as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Or they will find someone else because the other guy is occupied to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;often.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe that the widespread use of computer networks will create</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; even greater flexibility in people's lives and allow people many more options</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; for organizing their lives, including greater flexibility of who they work</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; for.  Technology is providing people the tools they need to take care of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; themselves better and manage their own lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I agree with a lot of things you are saying, but we must keep in mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that it is only true in some situations and for some jobs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Small companies working together on large projects would need to much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;coordination and thus be inefficient. We are still humans that need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;work and comunicate with other humans. Thats the most important thing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;remember.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The new way of working probably won't be a revolution but an evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;People have worked together for may years now, and only a limited number</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of ways seem to be efficient. Of course technology will change</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something, but i don't think it will be a very radical departure.</i><br>
