As Nicholas said, its implausible that a very hard step, such as<br>
language, happened so soon after its enabling large brains prior step,<br>
unless some special very usual environment was involved (and its hard<br>
to see what that could be).  <br>
<p>
The step could have happened long ago though, if it was something<br>
basic about mammal brains, that just needed time to flower into us.<br>
We don't need fossil evidence for this - looking at today's mammals<br>
and birds is good enough.  Is there anything lacking in bird brains so<br>
they couldn't have become like us, had they had hands and large social<br>
groups? <br>
