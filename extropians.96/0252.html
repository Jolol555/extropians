SIGNS OF PAST LIFE ON MARS?  ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND POSSIBLE  <br>
BIOLOGICAL FEATURES FOUND IN MARTIAN METEORITE <br>
(Featured in 16 August 1996 Science) <br>
American Association for the Advancement of Science News Release <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Ever since scientists learned that water once flowed on Mars,  <br>
they've wondered whether life might also have flourished on the  <br>
apparently now-dead planet.  In the 16 August issue of Science,  <br>
McKay et al report the first identification of organic compounds  <br>
in a Martian meteorite.  The authors further suggest that these  <br>
compounds, in conjunction with a number of other mineralogical  <br>
features observed in the rock, may be evidence of ancient Martian  <br>
microorganisms.  The paper's authors are David S. McKay and  <br>
Everett K. Gibson, Jr., of NASA's Johnson Space Center in  <br>
Houston, TX; Kathie L. Thomas-Keprta of Lockheed Martin in  <br>
Houston, TX; Hojatollah Vali of McGill University in Montreal,  <br>
Quebec; Christopher S. Romanek of the University of Georgia's  <br>
Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in Aiken, SC; and Simon J.  <br>
Clemett, Xavier D. F. Chllier, Claude R. Maechlin, and Richard N.  <br>
Zare of Stanford University in Stanford, CA. <br>
 <br>
Organic (complex, carbon-based) molecules are the requisite  <br>
building blocks of life on Earth.  The authors looked for signs  <br>
of such molecules and other mineralogical and textural  <br>
indications of past life within the pore space and fractures of  <br>
meteorite Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001), one of only 12 meteorites  <br>
identified as having come from Mars.  ALH84001 is the oldest of  <br>
the Martian dozen, having crystallized from molten rock about 4.5  <br>
billion years ago, early in the planet's evolution, and it is the  <br>
only Martian meteorite to contain significant carbonate minerals.   <br>
(The carbonates formed sometime after the rock, perhaps about 3.6  <br>
billion years ago.) <br>
 <br>
About 15 million years ago, a major asteroid impact on Mars threw  <br>
ALH84001 into space, where it eventually fell onto an ice field  <br>
in Antarctica about 13,000 years ago.  ALH84001, which shows  <br>
little evidence of terrestrial weathering, was discovered by  <br>
meteorite-hunting scientists in 1984 and only recently identified  <br>
at Martian.  ALH84001 is riven with tiny fractures resulting  <br>
primarily from impacts that occurred while the rock was on Mars.  <br>
The secondary carbonates formed along with some of these  <br>
fractures.  The Science authors prepared thin sample sections  <br>
that included these pre-existing fractures, and found on their  <br>
surfaces a clear and distinct distribution of polycyclic aromatic  <br>
hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic molecules containing multiple  <br>
connected rings of carbon atoms--the first organic molecules ever  <br>
seen in a Martian rock.  A variety of contamination checks and  <br>
control experiments indicated that the organic material was  <br>
indigenous to the rock and was not the result of terrestrial  <br>
contamination.  For example, the authors noted that the  <br>
concentration of PAHs increases inward, whereas terrestrial  <br>
contamination likely would have resulted in more PAHs on the  <br>
exterior of the rock. <br>
 <br>
The big question is:  where did the PAHs come from?  It is  <br>
thought that PAHs can form one of two ways:  non-biologically,  <br>
during early star formation; or biologically, through the  <br>
activity of bacteria or other living organisms, or their  <br>
degradation (fossilization).  On Earth, PAHs are abundant as  <br>
fossil molecules in ancient sedimentary rocks, coal and  <br>
petroleum, the result of chemical changes that occurred to the  <br>
remains of dead marine plankton and early plant life.  They also  <br>
occur during partial combustion, such as when a candle burns or  <br>
food is grilled. <br>
 <br>
To address the origin of these PAHs, the authors examined the  <br>
chemistry, mineralogy, and texture of carbonates associated with  <br>
PAHs in the Martian meteorite.  Under the transmission electron  <br>
microscope, the carbonate globules were seen to contain fine- <br>
grained magnetite and iron-sulfide particles.  From these and  <br>
other analyses, the authors developed a list of observations  <br>
about the carbonates and PAHs that, taken individually, could be  <br>
explained by non-biological means.  However, as they write in  <br>
their Science article, "when considered collectively ... we  <br>
conclude that [these phenomena] are evidence for primitive life  <br>
on early Mars."  Some of their observations are as follows: <br>
 <br>
* The higher concentrations of PAHs were found associated with  <br>
the carbonates. <br>
 <br>
* The carbonates formed within the rock fissures, about 3.6  <br>
billion years ago, and are younger than the rock itself. <br>
 <br>
* The magnetite and iron-sulfide particles inside the carbonate  <br>
globules are chemically, structurally and morphologically similar  <br>
to magnetosome particles produced by bacteria on Earth. <br>
 <br>
* High-resolution scanning electron microscopy revealed on the  <br>
surface of the carbonates small (100 nanometers) ovoids and  <br>
elongated features.  Similar textures have been found on the  <br>
surface of calcite concretions grown from Pleistocene groundwater  <br>
in southern Italy, which have been interpreted as representing  <br>
nanobacteria. <br>
 <br>
* Some earlier reports had suggested that the temperature at  <br>
which the ALH84001 carbonates formed was as high as 700 degrees  <br>
C--much too hot for any kind of life. However, the isotopic  <br>
composition of the carbonates, and the new data on the magnetite  <br>
and iron-sulfide particles, imply a temperature range of 0 to 80  <br>
degrees C, cool enough for life. <br>
 <br>
* The magnetite--a mineral that contains some ferric (Fe3+) iron,  <br>
perhaps indicating formation by oxidation (the addition of  <br>
oxygen)--and iron sulfide--a mineral that can be formed by  <br>
reduction (the loss of oxygen)--were found in close proximity in  <br>
the Martian meteorite.  On Earth, closely associated  <br>
mineralogical features involving both oxidation and reduction are  <br>
characteristic of biological activity. <br>

METEORITE YIELDS EVIDENCE OF PRIMITIVE LIFE ON EARLY MARS <br>
NASA release 96-160 <br>
 <br>
A NASA research team of scientists at the Johnson Space Center  <br>
(JSC), Houston, TX, and at Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA,  <br>
has found evidence that strongly suggests primitive life may have  <br>
existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.  The NASA-funded  <br>
team found the first organic molecules thought to be of Martian  <br>
origin; several mineral features characteristic of biological  <br>
activity; and possible microscopic fossils of primitive,  <br>
bacteria-like organisms inside of an ancient Martian rock that  <br>
fell to Earth as a meteorite.  This array of indirect evidence of  <br>
past life will be reported in the August 16 issue of the journal  <br>
Science, presenting the investigation to the scientific community  <br>
at large for further study.  The two-year investigation was co- <br>
led by JSC planetary scientists Dr. David McKay, Dr. Everett  <br>
Gibson and Kathie Thomas-Keprta of Lockheed-Martin, with the  <br>
major collaboration of a Stanford team headed by Professor of  <br>
Chemistry Dr. Richard Zare, as well as six other NASA and  <br>
university research partners. <br>
 <br>
"There is not any one finding that leads us to believe that this  <br>
is evidence of past life on Mars.  Rather, it is a combination of  <br>
many things that we have found," McKay said.  "They include  <br>
Stanford's detection of an apparently unique pattern of organic  <br>
molecules, carbon compounds that are the basis of life.  We also  <br>
found several unusual mineral phases that are known products of  <br>
primitive microscopic organisms on Earth.  Structures that could  <br>
be microscopic fossils seem to support all of this.  The  <br>
relationship of all of these things in terms of location--within  <br>
a few hundred thousandths of an inch of one another--is the most  <br>
compelling evidence." <br>
 <br>
"It is very difficult to prove life existed 3.6 billion years ago  <br>
on Earth, let alone on Mars," Zare said.  "The existing standard  <br>
of proof, which we think we have met, includes having an  <br>
accurately dated sample that contains native microfossils,  <br>
mineralogical features characteristic of life, and evidence of  <br>
complex organic chemistry." <br>
 <br>
"For two years, we have applied state-of-the-art technology to  <br>
perform these analyses, and we believe we have found quite  <br>
reasonable evidence of past life on Mars," Gibson added.  "We  <br>
don't claim that we have conclusively proven it.  We are putting  <br>
this evidence out to the scientific community for other  <br>
investigators to verify, enhance, attack--disprove if they can --  <br>
as part of the scientific process.  Then, within a year or two,  <br>
we hope to resolve the question one way or the other." <br>
 <br>
"What we have found to be the most reasonable interpretation is  <br>
of such radical nature that it will only be accepted or rejected  <br>
after other groups either confirm our findings or overturn them,"  <br>
McKay added. <br>
 <br>
The igneous rock in the 4.2-pound, potato-sized meteorite has  <br>
been age-dated to about 4.5 billion years, the period when the  <br>
planet Mars formed.  The rock is believed to have originated  <br>
underneath the Martian surface and to have been extensively  <br>
fractured by impacts as meteorites bombarded the planets in the  <br>
early inner solar system.  Between 3.6 billion and 4 billion  <br>
years ago, a time when it is generally thought that the planet  <br>
was warmer and wetter, water is believed to have penetrated  <br>
fractures in the subsurface rock, possibly forming an underground  <br>
water system. <br>
 <br>
Since the water was saturated with carbon dioxide from the  <br>
Martian atmosphere, carbonate minerals were deposited in the  <br>
fractures.  The team's findings indicate living organisms also  <br>
may have assisted in the formation of the carbonate, and some  <br>
remains of the microscopic organisms may have become fossilized,  <br>
in a fashion similar to the formation of fossils in limestone on  <br>
Earth.  Then, 16 million years ago, a huge comet or asteroid  <br>
struck Mars, ejecting a piece of the rock from its subsurface  <br>
location with enough force to escape the planet.  For millions of  <br>
years, the chunk of rock floated through space.  It encountered  <br>
Earth's atmosphere 13,000 years ago and fell in Antarctica as a  <br>
meteorite. <br>
 <br>
It is in the tiny globs of carbonate that the researchers found a  <br>
number of features that can be interpreted as suggesting past  <br>
life.  Stanford researchers found easily detectable amounts of  <br>
organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  <br>
concentrated in the vicinity of the carbonate.  Researchers at  <br>
JSC found mineral compounds commonly associated with microscopic  <br>
organisms and the possible microscopic fossil structures. <br>
 <br>
The largest of the possible fossils are less than 1/100 the  <br>
diameter of a human hair, and most are about 1/1000 the diameter  <br>
of a human hair--small enough that it would take about a thousand  <br>
laid end-to-end to span the dot at the end of this sentence.   <br>
Some are egg-shaped while others are tubular.  In appearance and  <br>
size, the structures are strikingly similar to microscopic  <br>
fossils of the tiniest bacteria found on Earth. <br>
 <br>
The meteorite, called ALH84001, was found in 1984 in Allan Hills  <br>
ice field, Antarctica, by an annual expedition of the National  <br>
Science Foundation's Antarctic Meteorite Program.  It was  <br>
preserved for study in JSC's Meteorite Processing Laboratory and  <br>
its possible Martian origin was not recognized until 1993.  It is  <br>
one of only 12 meteorites identified so far that match the unique  <br>
Martian chemistry measured by the Viking spacecraft that landed  <br>
on Mars in 1976.  ALH84001 is by far the oldest of the 12 Martian  <br>
meteorites, more than three times as old as any other. <br>
 <br>
Many of the team's findings were made possible only because of  <br>
very recent technological advances in high- resolution scanning  <br>
electron microscopy and laser mass spectrometry.  Only a few  <br>
years ago, many of the features that they report were  <br>
undetectable.  Although past studies of this meteorite and others  <br>
of Martian origin failed to detect evidence of past life, they  <br>
were generally performed using lower levels of magnification,  <br>
without the benefit of the technology used in this research.  The  <br>
recent discovery of extremely small bacteria on Earth, called  <br>
nanobacteria, prompted the team to perform this work at a much  <br>
finer scale than past efforts. <br>
 <br>
The nine authors of the Science report include McKay, Gibson and  <br>
Thomas-Keprta of JSC; Christopher Romanek, formerly a National  <br>
Research Council post-doctoral fellow at JSC who is now a staff  <br>
scientist at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the  <br>
University of Georgia; Hojatollah Vali, a National Research  <br>
Council post-doctoral fellow at JSC and a staff scientist at  <br>
McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and Zare, graduate  <br>
students Simon J. Clemett and Claude R. Maechling and post- <br>
doctoral student Xavier Chillier of the Stanford University  <br>
Department of Chemistry. <br>
 <br>
The team of researchers includes a wide variety of expertise,  <br>
including microbiology, mineralogy, analytical techniques,  <br>
geochemistry and organic chemistry, and the analysis crossed all  <br>
of these disciplines.  Further details on the findings presented  <br>
in the Science article include: <br>
 <br>
* Researchers at Stanford University used a dual laser mass  <br>
spectrometer--the most sensitive instrument of its type in the  <br>
world--to look for the presence of the common family of organic  <br>
molecules called PAHs.  When microorganisms die, the complex  <br>
organic molecules that they contain frequently degrade into PAHs.   <br>
PAHs are often associated with ancient sedimentary rocks, coals  <br>
and petroleum on Earth and can be common air pollutants.  Not  <br>
only did the scientists find PAHs in easily detectable amounts in  <br>
ALH84001, but they found that these molecules were concentrated  <br>
in the vicinity of the carbonate globules.  This finding appears  <br>
consistent with the proposition that they are a result of the  <br>
fossilization process.  In addition, the unique composition of  <br>
the meteorite's PAHs is consistent with what the scientists  <br>
expect from the fossilization of very primitive microorganisms.   <br>
On Earth, PAHs virtually always occur in thousands of forms, but,  <br>
in the meteorite, they are dominated by only about a half-dozen  <br>
different compounds.  The simplicity of this mixture, combined  <br>
with the lack of light-weight PAHs like naphthalene, also differs  <br>
substantially from that of PAHs previously measured in non- <br>
Martian meteorites. <br>
 <br>
* The team found unusual compounds--iron sulfides and magnetite-- <br>
that can be produced by anaerobic bacteria and other microscopic  <br>
organisms on Earth.  The compounds were found in locations  <br>
directly associated with the fossil-like structures and carbonate  <br>
globules in the meteorite.  Extreme conditions--conditions very  <br>
unlikely to have been encountered by the meteorite--would have  <br>
been required to produce these compounds in close proximity to  <br>
one another if life were not involved.  The carbonate also  <br>
contained tiny grains of magnetite that are almost identical to  <br>
magnetic fossil remnants often left by certain bacteria found on  <br>
Earth.  Other minerals commonly associated with biological  <br>
activity on Earth were found in the carbonate as well. <br>
 <br>
* The formation of the carbonate or fossils by living organisms  <br>
while the meteorite was in the Antarctic was deemed unlikely for  <br>
several reasons.  The carbonate was age dated using a parent- <br>
daughter isotope method and found to be 3.6 billion years old,  <br>
and the organic molecules were first detected well within the  <br>
ancient carbonate.  In addition, the team analyzed representative  <br>
samples of other meteorites from Antarctica and found no evidence  <br>
of fossil-like structures, organic molecules or possible  <br>
biologically produced compounds and minerals similar to those in  <br>
the ALH84001 meteorite.  The composition and location of PAHs  <br>
organic molecules found in the meteorite also appeared to confirm  <br>
that the possible evidence of life was extraterrestrial.  No PAHs  <br>
were found in the meteorite's exterior crust, but the  <br>
concentration of PAHs increased in the meteorite's interior to  <br>
levels higher than ever found in Antarctica.  Higher  <br>
concentrations of PAHs would have likely been found on the  <br>
exterior of the meteorite, decreasing toward the interior, if the  <br>
organic molecules are the result of contamination of the  <br>
meteorite on Earth. <br>
