1) It didn't occur to Eliezer that FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON is not a scientific<br>
report of an actual experiment and its sequelae but a crafted tragedy which<br>

<p>
2) It didn't occur to anaesthesiologists that if there were a technique to<br>
control pain, with no downside, it would long since have occured as a<br>
natural mutation.  Just as well it didn't occur to them.<br>
