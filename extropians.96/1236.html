<i>&gt;          Dan Clemmensen has suggested that corporations don't colonise </i><br>
<i>&gt;          the cosmos because of their high discount rate for future benefits. </i><br>
<i>&gt;          The discount rate would presumably be high because of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          rapidity of their subjective time and the slowness of </i><br>
<i>&gt;          cosmic travels. The idea is interesting since, if right, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;          help resolve the Fermi paradox.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;          One reason why corporations could have a high discount rate </i><br>
<i>&gt;          would be if they had a bias towards the near future, just as we</i><br>
<i>&gt;          humans have. We tend to care more about an imminent pleasure</i><br>
<i>&gt;          than about a similar one we would sure to get in a billion</i><br>
<i>&gt;          years. Perhaps all corporations would be "irrational" in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;          way?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;          Another reason why a corporation might discount the benefits of</i><br>
<i>&gt;          colonisation is because the benefits would only come about </i><br>
<i>&gt;          if it diverted some of its resources to the space mission,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          resources which could have been used for other purposes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Suppose that the objective of the corporation is to maximise the</i><br>
<i>&gt;          amount of valuable computations it will carry out during its</i><br>
<i>&gt;          life time.   At a certain time t it has a given capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;          (consisting perhaps of its mass or available energy). </i><br>
<i>&gt;          Part of this capital could be invested into a project that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;          yield returns at t'&gt;t, but meanwhile that capital could not</i><br>
<i>&gt;          be used to make valuable computations, i.e. there would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;          an opportunity cost which would have to be subtracted from</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the expected returns when considering whether the investment</i><br>
<i>&gt;          is worthwhile.   The question is what the function</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          f = valuablecomputationspower(capital) </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          looks like. For Clemmensen's argument to go through, </i><br>
<i>&gt;          it would not suffice that f had a jerk at some point, because </i><br>
<i>&gt;          different corporations would presumably start out with </i><br>
<i>&gt;          somewhat different amounts of capital. If all corporations </i><br>
<i>&gt;          had originally a capital less than the critical amount, </i><br>
<i>&gt;          then they would invest in space missions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          but the benefit of space missions seems to come in chunks</i><br>
<i>&gt;          (one chunk for every planet or solar system one arrived at),</i><br>
<i>&gt;          and so there would be some overshoot:  most corporations </i><br>
<i>&gt;          would obtain a capital greater than the critical value, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;          they would have little to lose from using the excess for </i><br>
<i>&gt;          new space missions.  f would rather have to have the shape of </i><br>
<i>&gt;          an inverted exponential, so that for each amount of capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;          (greater than some start-up value), a slight loss of capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;          would reduce the computation power greatly, whereas a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt;          increase would bring but a negligible increase.  Not only</i><br>
<i>&gt;          would the function have to be of an exponential character,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the constants would have to be rather great, considering</i><br>
<i>&gt;          that the gains would be obtained after perhaps a thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt;          years and be enjoyed for perhaps billions of years, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the required investment would presumably be very small</i><br>
<i>&gt;          compared to the corporation's total capital whereas the gains </i><br>
<i>&gt;          could be very substantial. For instance, if any considerable</i><br>
<i>&gt;          degree of parallelization of valuable computations were</i><br>
<i>&gt;          possible, then df/d(capital) would certainly not decrease</i><br>
<i>&gt;          rapidly enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;          If Robin's objection, that not all knowledge can be obtained</i><br>
<i>&gt;          simply by sitting back and thinking (making computations), </i><br>
<i>&gt;          is directed against Clemmensen's basic idea rather than </i><br>
<i>&gt;          against some other more specific claim Clemmensen has made, </i><br>
<i>&gt;          then I don't think it carries very much weight, because </i><br>
<i>&gt;          there is no obvious reason why corporations should be </i><br>
<i>&gt;          interested in the detailed structure of distant cosmic regions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;          We must not forget that a mere suggestion for where</i><br>
<i>&gt;          the Great Filter could be, even if it falls short of being a proof,</i><br>
<i>&gt;          would be very helpful;  in any case there seem to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;          much greater difficulties with Clemmensen's proposal </i><br>
<i>&gt;          than that it assumes that the curiosity of corporations is </i><br>
<i>&gt;          rather limited.</i><br>
 <br>
My apologies to Nicholas Bostrom and Dan Clemmensen... <br>
but I was curious to see what this post would look like if you substitute <br>
"corporation" for "SI" throughout.  Does it still make sense?    <br>
What exactly is the difference between a corporation and an SI? <br>
