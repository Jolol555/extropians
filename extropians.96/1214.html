          Dan Clemmensen has suggested that SIs don't colonise cosmos <br>
          because of their high discount rate for future benefits. The <br>
          discount rate would presumably be high because of the <br>
          rapidity of their subjective time and the slowness of cosmic <br>
          travels. The idea is interesting since, if right, it would <br>
          help resolve the Fermi paradox.<br>
          <br>
          One reason why SIs could have a high discount rate would be <br>
          if they had a bias towards the near future, just as we <br>
          humans have. We tend to care more about an imminent pleasure <br>
          than about a similar one we would sure to get in a billion <br>
          years. Perhaps all SIs would be "irrational" in the same <br>
          way?<br>
          <br>
          Another reason why an SI might discount the benefits of <br>
          colonisation is because they would only come about if it <br>
          diverted some of its resources to the space mission, <br>
          resources which could have been used for other purposes. <br>
          Suppose that the objective of the SI is to maximise the <br>
          amount of valuable computations it will carry out during its <br>
          life time. At a certain time t it has a given capital <br>
          (consisting perhaps of its mass or available energy). Part <br>
          of this capital could be invested into a project that would <br>
          yield returns at t'&gt;t, but meanwhile that capital could not <br>
          be used to make valuable computations, i.e. there would be <br>
          an opportunity cost which would have to be subtracted from <br>
          the expected returns when considering whether the investment <br>
          is worthwhile. The question is what the function <br>
          f=valuablecomputationspower(capital) looks like. For <br>
          Clemmensen's argument to go through, it would not suffice <br>
          that f had a jerk at some point, because different SIs would <br>
          presumably start out with somewhat different amounts of <br>
          capital. If all SI had originally a capital less that the <br>
          critical amount, then they would invest in space missions, <br>
          but the benefit of space missions seems to come in chunks <br>
          (one chunk for every planet or solar system one arrived at), <br>
          and so there would be some overshoot: most SIs would obtain <br>
          a capital greater than the critical value, and they would <br>
          have little to lose from using the excess for new space <br>
          missions. f would rather have to have the shape of an <br>
          inverted exponential, so that for each amount of capital <br>
          (greater than some start-up value), a slight loss of capital <br>
          would reduce the computation power greatly, whereas a slight <br>
          increase would bring but a negligible increase. Not only <br>
          would the function have to be of an exponential character, <br>
          the constants would have to be rather great, considering <br>
          that the gains would be obtained after perhaps a thousand <br>
          years and be enjoyed for perhaps billions of years, while <br>
          the required investment would presumably be very small <br>
          compared to the SI's total capital whereas the gains could <br>
          be very substantial. For instance, if any considerable <br>
          degree of parallelization of valuable computations were <br>
          possible, then df/d(capital) would certainly not decrease <br>
          rapidly enough.<br>
          <br>
          If Robin's objection, that not all knowledge can be obtained <br>
          simply by sitting back and think (making computations), is <br>
          directed against Clemmensen's basic idea rather than against <br>
          some other more specific claim Clemmensen has made, then I <br>
          don't think it carries very much weight, because there is no <br>
          obvious reason why SIs should be interested in the detailed <br>
          structure of distant cosmic regions. We must not forget that <br>
          a mere suggestion for where the Great Filter could be, even <br>
          if it falls short of being a proof, would be very helpful; <br>
          in any case there seem to be much greater difficulties with <br>
          Clemmensen's proposal than that it assumes that the <br>
          curiosity of SIs is rather limited.<br>
