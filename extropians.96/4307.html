<p>
<i>&gt; How about using curtains or Venetian blinds?  Or using envelopes for</i><br>
<i>&gt; letters?  "Encryption is an envelope for your e-mail" may sound trite,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but as far as I can tell is true.</i><br>
<p>
If encryption were as common as curtains and envelopes, then it <br>
wouldn't attract attention.  But it isn't that common.  <br>
<p>
Consider three subsets of the set of all people who send e-mail:  <br>
<p>
1.  People who don't use encryption. <br>
2.  People who use encryption, but do nothing else to attract attention to <br>
themselves.  <br>
3.  People who use encryption, and also post defiant messages about <br>
destroying the government by depriving it of its tax revenues.  <br>
<p>
The vast majority of people who send e-mail fall into subset #1.  <br>
Subset #2 is rather small.  It is small enough so that the NSA or FBI can <br>
keep a list of such people.  Subset #3 is very small indeed; probably <br>
less than a thousand, possibly less than 100.  The government can easily <br>
identify such people and watch them.  They are just asking for it.  <br>
<p>
If somebody puts up curtains and blinds in all his windows, and keeps <br>
them closed *all the time*, and drives a VW bus with Grateful Dead <br>
decals all over it, plus a bumper sticker that says "Just Say Grow!" -- <br>
that would be foolhardy, but not as foolhardy as what a certain person <br>
on this list is doing.  <br>
