Romana posits:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Extropy is the quality of creative order characteristic of living systems.</i><br>
<p>
While an interesting attempt, I think that this definition would muddy rather<br>
than clarify.  For one thing, it covers far more territory than "extropy"<br>
proper.  I daresay that the proposed definition sounds nearly coextensive<br>
with organic chem!  At any rate, it fails to focus on the things that really<br>
interest Extropians:  intelligence technologies, self-transformation,<br>
boundless expansion, etc.<br>
<p>
For another thing, the putative definition skirts circularity.  What is a<br>
"living system" if not a system that embodies the qualities emcompassed by<br>
"extropy"?  Of course, you might try to define "living" separately, but as a<br>
review of the literature on artificial life will quickly reveal, you will<br>
quickly find yourself in deep water.<br>
<p>
I do not mean to impugn the study of "the quality of creative order<br>
characteristic of living systems," (whatever that may be).  Such a study may<br>
prove useful and interesting.  It would not, however, say much about<br>
"extropy."  <br>
<p>
Unless I underestimate the difficulty of generating new words, it should not<br>
be hard to think up a new and more appropriate term.  This would not only<br>
enrich our vocabularies but avoid unnecessary confusion.<br>
