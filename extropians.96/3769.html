<i>&gt;&gt;  The only downside that I see to this is that such creation would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;require effort to the tune of tens of millions of dollars (and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a lot more still).  This could be done incrementally and after some</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Immersive, full-sensory 3D will of course be an expensive proposition, due</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the high bandwidth and level of detail required.</i><br>
<p>
It won't be expensive because we will create more and more of it as<br>
technology progresses. By the time we're ready for full-sensory 3D VR it<br>
will be becoming a standard on PCs. We want to use all of the most<br>
standardized tools so that we can evolve the environment and not get stuck<br>
in a deadend and need to backtrack if certain VRML commands are ditched for<br>
other better ones.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I had more in mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;right now would just be a world that looked something like an online</i><br>
<i>&gt;Transhumanist/Extropian version of the game "Myst" but where you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;interact with other users online and play with some interesting applets.  </i><br>
<p>
Ahhh. I too once had the idea to create a myst-like VRML world. I wanted to<br>
base it on Myst though and sent the company mail who didn't like the idea<br>
all that much. I just wonder why people didn't get motivated as such when I<br>
suggested we come up with ideas for what environments we will want to live<br>
in when we're uploaded. I guess it's just your magic touch, Wade. :)<br>
