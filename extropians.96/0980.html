neurons are just a tool<br>
spinal columns are just a tool<br>
lungs are just a tool<br>
hands are just a tool<br>
speech is just a tool<br>
democracy is just a tool<br>
money is just a tool<br>

all the parts of our bodies and minds, languages, customs, symbols and<br>
relationships are just tools.<br>
