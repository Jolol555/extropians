<i>&gt;I leave the truth of these visions for others to debate. In many ways, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;and how we will be extinguished is not the point. What is important about</i><br>
<i>&gt;them is that they reflect the fears of their times. They are encoded</i><br>
<i>&gt;markers of transition, movement and imbalance.</i><br>
<p>
If Vinge's predictions (which are of a *choice* between extinction and<br>
transformation) were clearly false, or about a remote future rather than<br>
an immediate one, then exploring the related fears and cultural resonances<br>
would make sense.<br>
<p>
If he were plausibly right, then of course people would be afraid, and of<br>
course people would have related concerns, but these subjective reactions<br>
would be only minor aspects of an urgent real situation.<br>
<p>
So when you say you leave the debate for others, I take it you mean you have<br>
made up your own mind, that Vinge's predictions are false?<br>
