As others have pointed out, it is unlikely you could cram enough nutrients<br>
into a single pill (and if you could, I assume its expansion when hydrated<br>
would be quite painful :-). It is probably possible to concoct an<br>
extremely high density nutrient diet; something like Felix's cup of olive<br>
oil with a few blocks of protein-carbohydrates laced with trace elements<br>
and other necessary chemicals (is it better to use whole proteins or free<br>
amino acids?). Maybe something like a bar or two of "chocolate". <br>
<p>
I do not buy the argument we do not know enough to make a 100% sustaining<br>
meal yet; some people have lived for decades on intravenous nutrient<br>
solutions with no ill effects. Presumably the contents of these solutions<br>
could be turned into a meal of some kind (taking care to take<br>
gastrointestinal tract inefficiencies and capabilities into account for<br>
the new concentrations). <br>
<p>
The main argument against the "meal in the pill" is simply that it will<br>
not be very fulfilling; our appetite is regulated much by taste, texture<br>
and enjoyment, and I guess a nutrient meal would tend to the boring (it<br>
could of course be spiced up, but then we would be going full circle back<br>
to the breakfast Chris wanted to avoid in the first place). <br>
<p>
Personally I would like to develop this area anyway, since I love great <br>
food, and if it could be healthy and nutritious *and* delicious, CR diets <br>
would suddenly become much easier. <br>
