I'm sorry that David Musick has apparently taken personal offense at my last<br>
post, I was not trying to insult him, in fact, I believe David has<br>
written some high quality, thought provoking posts lately, I even liked his<br>
"God" post. I don't agree with it, but I thought it was good. Posts I agree<br>
with completely are dull.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;It seems that John's dogmatism has interfered with his</i><br>
<i>                &gt;reading comprehension capibilities (Dogmatism will ruin your</i><br>
<i>                &gt;mind; Just Say No!).  If my post is read again, it will be</i><br>
<i>                &gt;clear that I said nothing about any *omnipotent* or</i><br>
<i>                &gt; *omniscient* God.</i><br>
                                      <br>
<p>
It's true, you never used the words "omnipotent" or "omniscient"  but I don't<br>
think you needed to because you used another word "God" and even said it<br>
might explain the ultimate fact of our existence. In modern times the dividing<br>
line between a conscious being who is called God and a conscious being<br>
who is not, is the concept of infinity. Yes, it's just a tradition, and<br>
as you say all tradition should be questioned, but I have come to the<br>
conclusion that this particular tradition is a good one if the word "God" is<br>
to be meaningful. If you keep making God weaker and more vague then obviously<br>
you would eventually reach a point where I would have to agree that God does<br>
exist, but this doesn't seem to be a useful exercise to me.<br>
<p>
When I tell people that I am an atheist I've had some respond contemptuously<br>
and say "Oh, so you don't think anything is greater than yourself". Sort of<br>
flattering really, what they're saying is that the only thing greater than me<br>
is God. Bertrand Russell said something relevant to this "Many people are <br>
willing to abandon the idea of God, but very few are willing to abandon the <br>
word "God".<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;When we are very advanced, it is likely that we will be able </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to create mini-universes (sometimes called "baby universes").  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, it's a possibility, but I see no reason why the beings in such a universe<br>
would have to be our intellectual inferiors.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Perhaps universes which exhibit life, intelligence and</i><br>
<i>                &gt;creativity will be especially useful to us, and we will</i><br>
<i>                &gt;seek to create living, intelligent universes, so that we can </i><br>
<i>                &gt;use their intelligence to help us solve problems, much like </i><br>
<i>                &gt;we use transistors in computer systems to help us solve </i><br>
<i>                &gt;problems now.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Another possibility, but it would be a very poor sort of god indeed if He<br>
needed us to help him figure things out. Colleague would be a better word than<br>
God.                             <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The universes we create would probably develop through </i><br>
<i>                &gt;evolution </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But why would we use Darwin's style of Evolution with its horrible random<br>
mutation and natural selection? Evolution by the inheritance of acquired<br>
characteristics was long ago found not to occur in nature. It's too bad, <br>
it would be a wonderful consolation to know that the muscular body you<br>
worked so hard to develop, would make your children strong too. How splendid<br>
it would be if your offspring were born knowing everything you struggled to<br>
learn during your life. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way in our world,<br>
Shakespeare's daughter had to start from square one and learn how to hold a<br>
pen and make sense from squiggles written on paper, Einstein's son had to<br>
reinvent the wheel and rediscover that 2 +2 = 4.<br>
                             <br>
Besides being less cruel, Lamarck's type of evolution would be much faster <br>
than Darwinian evolution, that's why social evolution is so much swifter than <br>
biological evolution.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;John, I don't know if your athiestic dogmatism allows you to</i><br>
<i>                &gt;think clearly, but why do you insist that we will be the</i><br>
<i>                &gt;first ones to create universes?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We may not be the first, but until the evidence suggests otherwise it's wise<br>
to assume the simplest theory as your working hypothesis.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Just to make it clear (for the dogmatically intoxicated and</i><br>
<i>                &gt;mentally impaired): I'm not saying this being is omnipotent;</i><br>
<i>                &gt;I'm just saying that it is a conscious being who is very</i><br>
<i>                &gt;powerful, powerful enough to create universes.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Then why call this being "God"? You must know that it is burdened with <br>
more baggage than any other word in the English language.<br>
                                        <br>
