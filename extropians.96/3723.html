Beyond The Beyond...<br>
---------------------<br>
<p>
   This is the deal.  I've recently been getting into three-dimensional,<br>
interactive virtual world building, and am currently teaching myself how to<br>
combine VRML 2.0 and Java to that end.  I was wondering if their are any<br>
transhumanist/extropian thinkers/visionaries/artists out their who  would<br>
like to help design a transhumanist virtual space, similar to the BeyondMOO<br>
at lucifer.com but in interactive, textured 3D (using VRML 2.0 with <br>
behaviours, Java scripting,etc).  I'm looking at this to be a fairly<br>
long-term process, but one I believe should be start as early as possible.<br>
Unfortunately, support for VRML, the scripting language used to develop<br>
3-dimensional worlds, is not quite where it could be.  Much of the problem<br>
lies in the hardware - you pretty much need at least a 28.8  connection and<br>
a pentium equivalent system to even get in the door. <br>
   However, I tryed Sony's new CP-browser on a T-1 line with a Pentium-90<br>
and it works beautifully. Animated, textured landscapes, objects you can<br>
manipulate, real-time music and sound, the primitive beginnings of AI<br>
agents, multi-user interaction with avatars - its all there. Once ISDN/Cable<br>
modems make the mainstream I think were going to see much  of what<br>
Stephenson, Sterling, Gibson and co. write about "cyberspace" become<br>
reality.  And one of the first of these cyber-worlds to make it on I want to<br>
make sure is a transhumanist one - vast, expansive, diverse, and growing (in<br>
other words, extropic).  So to this end, it would be nice to get some input<br>
from everyone and anyone interested in the idea.  Experience with<br>
Ray-tracing/3D modelling/Java<br>
would be great, but so to would anyone with ideas about what to actually<br>
put in this world - themes, ideas, concepts and how to present them in  an<br>
interesting and aethetically pleasing manner.  Server space isn't a huge<br>
concern; I'm getting 16 megs on a T-1 hub to begin with and can probably<br>
arrange for quite more as I need it. <br>
Here are some ideas for possible "areas" or "locales"- <br>
- General background setting - cryogenic vaults, parkland walks, office<br>
"buildings" of various companies - nano/AI/software startups, private space<br>
launch, cryonics, nootropics, biotech, etc.<br>
- Memetic Agora - Idea futures with interactive, 3D interface. <br>
- General meeting places - seaside/starside cafes, pavillions, forest clearings<br>
Transhumanist Art galleries - basically anywhere.  Also have utility for<br>
users to add there<br>
own "rooms", or personal areas.<br>
- Museum/Institute of Nanotechnology - animated nanobearings, <br>
molecular mechanics and nanosystem simulations, etc<br>
- Institute of complexity - Place to explore all sorts of Java applets<br>
dealing with fractals, a-life, cellular automata, genetic algorithms,<br>
evolutionary artwork, l-systems, neural networks, etc.<br>
- Other Institutes - Physics Demonstrations, Mathematics, cosmology,<br>
basically scientific visualization/multimedia.  A lot of this stuff is<br>
already out there, either offline or online -  it just needs to be brewed up<br>
with some Java and made pretty with VRML.<br>
- University/Academic - Libraries (links to hypertext, related resources all<br>
over the Web), lecture areas (real people "broadcasting" on a certain<br>
channel in a certain locale as in IRC's, but eventually with intelligent<br>
agents)    <br>
- Lyceums - Forums for scheduled debate, discussion - (Picture<br>
realtime brain-tennis with customized avatars)<br>
- "The Underground" - Places for people (like myself) that are<br>
into cryptoanarchy, temporary autonomous zones, agorist counter-economics,<br>
strong cryptography, untracable/untaxable digital e-cash, fall of states,<br>
CyberNexus, etc... <br>
- To liven things up, we could hold quests, where users would talk<br>
to people and interact with the world, scoring points or finding<br>
clues to some riddle.  <br>
<p>
Anyways, just a few ideas of varying practicality and worth - anyone of<br>
these could take years to develop in full, technicolor detail.  But if we<br>
start off with the seeds of each, and just<br>
have all sorts of people keep adding,adding, adding - it could all<br>
come together into something quite formidable (That is if the<br>
server doesn't crash long before - a good idea would be to eventually split<br>
up initial world into subworlds that reside on different servers).<br>
Yes, I realize a lot of this sounds ambitious, but basically the only areas<br>
that are holding us back are faster physical connections to Internet,<br>
fleshing out multi-user VRML, and development of autonomous agents. But with<br>
the rapid rate of development (Moore's Law), I expect to see 3D worlds<br>
become "cool places to be" as early as a year or two from now. <br>
<p>
Which leaves a lot of time to develop our worlds offline.<br>
(Basically it's a win/win - the longer it takes for<br>
the 3D Web revolution to happen, the longer it gives<br>
us to perfect our creations.  If it happens earlier,<br>
we can just add areas piecemeal.) <br>
So if any of this grabs your fancy, just e-mail me.  I'm hoping<br>
to have a sample world up when I put up my web-page in a month or so.  <br>
