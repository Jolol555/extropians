<i>&gt; I should have mentioned this earlier, but last month's</i><br>
<i>&gt; *Muscle &amp; Fitness* magazine published an article by Max More,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Zero In: Seven Keys For Pushing Beyond Your Limits", pp 82-84, 203.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's the most recent copy with Cory Everson on the cover.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I say "most recent" because Cory seems to be on the cover</i><br>
<i>&gt;  1/3 of most issues.)</i><br>
<p>
Max told me this article was coming out, and so I picked up an issue <br>
as soon as I saw it.  I was very impressed.  For one thing, there <br>
is a picture (!) of Max on the "Up Front" editorial page, and it's a <br>
great picture.  One thing in particular I noticed was that Max's pose <br>
clearly (conveniently? cleverly?) features a stainless steel wrist <br>
bracelet (his Alcor bracelet).<br>
<p>
I have been reading Muscle &amp; Fitness since Max turned me onto it a <br>
couple of years ago (it really is a good magazine), and so I was <br>
quite proud to see an article by him and a picture of him appear <br>
there.  But I was overjoyed to see the cryonics bracelet sneak into <br>
the *editorial* page of the magazine.  How about it Max?  Are you <br>
being as clever as I suspect here?  Secretly preparing the rest of <br>
the world for the future, even at the level of sneaking symbols of <br>
immortality into the subconsciouses of unsuspecting readers?<br>
 <br>
I know some will say that I'm making too big a deal out of this, and <br>
perhaps it's only important to me.  But I just thought it was one of <br>
the coolest things I'd seen in a long time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Good article, discussing the "inner game" of body sculpting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any other extropian bodybuilders out there, by the way?</i><br>
<p>
Well, my body ain't built yet, but I aspire to it, definitely.  The <br>
battle for me is against evolutionarily enhanced genes which scream <br>
SAVE UP FOR THE FAMINE!!  (Meaning, store all the fat possible.)  But <br>
I am optimistic, and lifting weights has definitely enhanced my life <br>
in many ways, even if not yet via total conquest and control of my <br>
body composition.<br>
