After reading my post regarding commerce being basically agreements between <br>
people to trade and business being a way of organizing resources to achieve <br>
one's goals, banjo replied:<br>
<p>
"OK, several things...<br>
1) you seem to totally integrated the "Human Relations as Commerce" meme.<br>
   By your definition Romantic Love is Business.<br>
2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on trade ?<br>
3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful <br>
people..."<br>
<p>
4) Re:"We are all responsible for our own lives"<br>
   are we also responsible (to some extent) for the lives of our neighbours,<br>
   children, aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped ???"<br>
<p>
Regarding #1:  I'm not saying that all human relations are commerce; I'm <br>
saying that commerce is an agreement to trade between two or more people.  I <br>
was saying this to counter the view that commerce alienates people from each <br>
other.  I think commerce and trading generally bring people together into <br>
common goals rather than alienating them.  <br>
<p>
I would say that Romantic Love has a LOT of similarities to trading, enough <br>
similarities that I would call it a form of trade.  It is basically an <br>
exchange between two people, a mutual sharing; and that's all a trade is: a <br>
mutual sharing.  When I call Romantic Love a form of trade, you probably think <br>
I am debasing Romantic Love and dragging it DOWN to the level of commerce.  <br>
But what I'm really doing is illustrating how wonderful commerce can be in <br>
some of it's finer forms.  What I'm trying to do is to get you to reconsider <br>
your negative view of commerce by showing you one form of commerce which you <br>
think is wonderful, namely, Romantic Love.  I suppose if you had an orgasm <br>
every time you bought or sold something, you'd have a very positive view of <br>
commerce already, just like you do of Romantic Love.<br>
<p>
Regarding #2:  No, I am not married or in any sort of romantic relationship <br>
currently, but if I was, I would view it as being based on the same principles <br>
that trade is based on: mutual sharing.  When we trade, we are both sharing <br>
what we have with each other.  Like I've said before, business and trading can <br>
be warm, dynamic relationships between humans in love, or they can be cold, <br>
impersonal transfers between people who don't care about each other.  You seem <br>
to have the view that commerce must remain limited to only the cold, <br>
impersonal kind.  I prefer to have my commerce be of a warm and loving nature.<br>
<p>
Regarding #3:  I define "success" as being able to effectively achieve one's <br>
desires.  Those who have what they want are successful, and the degree to <br>
which you are satisfied with your life is your degree of success in your life. <br>
 Because I desire close and intimate relationships with other humans, I view <br>
cooperation with other humans as being very important in becoming successful <br>
in my life.<br>
<p>
Regarding #4:  Are we responsible for the lives of those around us who are <br>
unable to take care of themselves?  First, I would say, we are "responsible" <br>
for whatever we choose to respond to.  I don't think I or anyone else is <br>
obligated to respond to the needs of those around us, but anyone can choose to <br>
respond to those needs, if they want to.  I, personally, have chosen to be <br>
responsible for the needs of the poor and helpless on this planet.  I did not <br>
HAVE to make this choice, but I made it because I truly care about other <br>
people.  <br>
<p>
The main cause of poverty, in my opinion, is the poor's lack of the <br>
appropriate knowledge and skills necessary to create wealth for themselves. <br>
(And I mean CREATING wealth, by adding value to one's resources through <br>
intelligence and ingenuity, not just taking it from other people)  To help <br>
them I am currently becoming highly educated myself and working on developing <br>
inexpensive and highly effective forms of education that can be easily <br>
implemented by anyone.  The most important thing, I believe, is to teach <br>
people how to be self-training and self-motivated, so that they use whatever <br>
resources available to them to educate themselves and increase the amount of <br>
resources available to them so they have more to learn from and work with.<br>
<p>
Oppression and tyranny also have a lot to do with poverty, but if the people <br>
were more educated and skillful, it would be much more difficult to maintain a <br>
tyranny over them and oppress them.<br>
