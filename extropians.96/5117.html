<i>&gt;If I sound like a lackey of the AMA, allow me to correct that.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;no love for them, or the FDA, or any other forced monopoly.  I simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;wish to debunk the "The establishment supresses cheap cures" meme that</i><br>
<i>&gt;charlatans employ to justify their snake oil.</i><br>
<p>
Please leave chiropractic out of this.  Yes, there are charlatans,<br>
even some chiropractors are probably charlatans, but chiropractic is<br>
not by nature a charlatan's art.  BTW, I take one thing I said back.<br>
For my own amusement, I tried looking up studies on chiropractic, and<br>
<a href="http://lifenet.life.edu/CRJ/korea1-3.html">http://lifenet.life.edu/CRJ/korea1-3.html</a> contains an article titled:<br>
"A Progress Report of Chiropractic Efficacy in the Treatment of Chronic Low<br>
Back Pain, Neck Pain, Headaches and Related Peripheral Conditions: a<br>
Double-blinded Time-series Study.".  There's apparently a study<br>
technique called "crossover" that allows a form of double-blinding even<br>
for treatments like chiropractic.  Intriguing study, though I think it has<br>
holes.<br>
<p>
In further support of its having been borne out over time, more and more<br>
(I'd say most by now) insurance companies cover chiropractic treatment.  I<br>
think some are starting to cover acupuncture.  Massage therapy is rarely<br>
covered.  I don't know of any that cover herbal/homeopathic treatments.<br>
Not conclusive, but insurance companies don't want to lose money, so they<br>
tend to cover only treatments shown to be "safe and effective" (especially<br>
cost-effective).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From <a href="http://www.outsourceint.com/art3.htm:">http://www.outsourceint.com/art3.htm:</a></i><br>
"The Magna Report -- commissioned by the Ontario Ministry of Health --<br>
which studied ways to reduce health care costs associated with lower back<br>
pain concluded that chiropractic care is the most cost-effective and safest<br>
way to treat lower back pain. This study in combination with the fact that<br>
the American Spine Society considers chiropractic care as the number one<br>
treatment for lower back pain and an article in the Journal of Occupational<br>
Medicine which stated that chiropractic treatment costs only 10% of the<br>
traditional treatment suggests that chiropractors may soon become the<br>
gatekeepers for back pain management in the near future."<br>

reviews a book that, while it admits chiropractic can be useful for low<br>
back pain, cautions against using it for other ailments.<br>

<p>
Virtually every other reference (of 200) to "chiropractic" near "effective"<br>
is from the chiropractic community, so I skipped them as biased even though<br>
some of them probably refer to neutral-party studies.  None of the 8<br>
references to "chiropractic" near "ineffective" actually is anti-chiropractic.<br>
I was actually surprised at how little anti-chiropractic material I could<br>
find.  You'd think the chiropractors were doing the suppressing.<br>
<p>
As with any treatment, "use only as directed".<br>
