I think you already know the items I'd offer for inclusion in Exponent, but<br>
to save you time, here's a draft of some language:<br>
<p>
LONDON GATHERING<br>
<p>
Sarah Marr, Martin Traynor, Nicholas Bostrom and Greg Burch gathered at a pub<br>
in London on November 3, 1996.  The group turned up a few beers and discussed<br>
the state of transhumanism and possible new initiatives for Extropy<br>
Institute.  Sarah in particular proposed some good ideas regarding<br>
organization of scientific and professional networking.  These ideas have<br>
been developed further since and have become key concepts for much of the new<br>
direction being taken by Extropy Institute discussed in this newsletter.<br>
<p>
EXpedition 97<br>
<p>
An extropian backpacking trip is being organized for the July 4th holiday in<br>
1997.  The current plan is for a trip from July 3 to 7 in the Pecos<br>
Wilderness Area near Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Greg Burch is coordinating plans<br>
for this trip.  Details can be found at the "official EXpedition 97 web<br>
page":<br>
<p>
     <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch2/exp97.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch2/exp97.html</a><br>
<p>
Greg will be updating interested extropians by e-mail, as well as with<br>
regular additions to the web page.  If you'd like to stay up to date on plans<br>
for the trip, send an e-mail to him at GBurch1@aol.com with the term "EXP97"<br>
at the begining of the subject line.<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>
<p>
Greg<br>
