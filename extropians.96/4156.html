I for one believe that there *are* subtle and distinct architectural<br>
differences between the male and female of the species.  I also believe that<br>
these architectural differences (be it structural or chemical differences)<br>
precipitate certain characteristics and tendencies.  Many of the social<br>
interactions that we can observe in our species, including gender<br>
differentiating ones, have evolved for one reason or another over millions<br>
of years.  Like a non-trivial percentage of our evolutionary baggage, some<br>
of our behaviors may not be particularly relevant in our current state of<br>
evolution, but persist nonetheless by force of nature.  Our technological<br>
development has been much quicker than our evolutionary development and it<br>
shows.  It may take more than one hundred years of technological and social<br>
development to reverse 10 million years of biological and evolutionary tuning.<br>
<p>
I personally evaluate every human (and transhuman) on an individual basis.<br>
However, it is equally prudent (and natural) that I notice patterns that<br>
correlate specific human characteristics and behaviors.  Whether or not<br>
these patterns were programmed by nature or society is irrelevant to<br>
recognizing that they exist.<br>
<p>
Many people are sensitive to this issue, so I have tried to keep the post as<br>
clinical as possible for the benefit of discussion.<br>
