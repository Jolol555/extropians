I was raised by a single female parent who held down a job as a college<br>
professor teaching mathematics and computer science, and I have always<br>
felt like I was totally untouched by the 'sexism' meme. Then one day I<br>
read something called 'A Person Paper on Purity in Language' by William<br>
Satire (alias Douglas R. Hofstadter.) It made me aware of just how<br>
sexually biased the very language I think in is (and it made me laugh at<br>
the same time!) I highly recommend it, but unfortunately don't have a<br>
URL to point you to. It's chapter eight in a collection of Hofstadter's<br>
essays called Metamagical Themas.<br>
