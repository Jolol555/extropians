<i>&gt;My statement of David Brin's views was based on my sincere attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand them in our correspondence a couple of years ago.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry Hal.  At the time I found willful and eager misinterpretation to be a<br>
better characterization of your attempt.  It's why (despite sincerely<br>
liking you, and respecting your obvious intelligence) I had to exit our<br>
useless exchange.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In discussing the pros and cons of privacy, Brin argues that there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a dichotomy between privacy and freedom, that if we have the one, we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;have the other.</i><br>
<p>
This proves my point. It is, indeed, a total misunderstanding.  I said no<br>
such thing.<br>
<p>
What I have said repeatedly is that privacy is a very nice thing. But it is<br>
a BENEFIT of freedom.  Even in a transparent society we will have some<br>
privacy, because as sovereign citizens we will be able to demand some.<br>
Under freedom, we can negotiate ways and means with each other.<br>
<p>
But accountability is not a benefit, it is the absolute basis of freedom.<br>
Its prime prerequisite.  Without accountability, freedom will die.  That is<br>
history.  That is human nature.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He says that our efforts to preserve</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy will actually cost us our freedom.</i><br>
<p>
Only if those efforts are not about privacy at all, but are about paranoic<br>
secrecy.  Inability to see the difference (and there is one) plagues the<br>
self righteous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In discussing the Clipper chip debate, a still-active policy dispute over</i><br>
<i>&gt;the government's efforts to ensure that it can get access to the plaintext</i><br>
<i>&gt;of encrypted communications, Brin offers a "Third Option": neither allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;the government a monopoly on eavesdropping, nor let individuals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;corporations have the ability to send meaningless scrambled messages and</i><br>
<i>&gt;static.  If the average person can't read the message, it should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;forbidden.  Encryption must be banned!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now he then follows this with some caveats related to the _practicality_</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the proposal, but not to the moral justification.</i><br>
<p>
I am, indeed, resigned to seeing us pass through a brief age of fog, in<br>
which people fill the corridors of honesty (the internet) with clouds of<br>
deceit.  But it won't matter much.  Those who rely on masks will be<br>
dismissed by mature people as irrelevant.<br>
<p>
Again, my role as curmugeonly contrarian is partly what drew me into this<br>
debate. The near universality of the secrecy-fetishism argument provoked me<br>
to offer a 3rd choice. So?  Not once have I heard a cypherpunk admit the<br>
existence of an entire class of solutions to the privacy dilemmas we face<br>
-- the mutual transparency class, which should be part of any mature<br>
discussion of these issues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Brin concludes the draft of his book by clarifying that he personally</i><br>
<i>&gt;has a vested interest in what he is advocating....</i><br>
<i>&gt;While I find it admirable that Brin is willing to make this forthright</i><br>
<i>&gt;admission, it still makes me question his arguments.</i><br>
<p>
Pah!  Again you pick and choose to support your point.  I _also state that<br>
in the long run, I'll wind up living off charity anyway, so it hardly<br>
matters!  I am arrogant enough to believe that people will pay me well all<br>
my life for the fecundity of my mind.  Copyright or no copyright.  Don't<br>
trawl for motives, Hal.  It's a discursive trick that's beneath you.<br>
<p>
 And now when he<br>
<i>&gt;says that his position is "diametrically opposed" to my characterization,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can only wonder at why he would have found it necessary to make this</i><br>
<i>&gt;admission if I was so wrong in my reading of his views.</i><br>
<p>
Say what?  Your sentences do not parse well and make no sense at all to me,<br>
Hal.  Hint: re-read email before sending.  I have no idea what the above<br>
means.<br>
<p>
I reiterate. You have never shown the slightest sign of paraphrasing me<br>
accurately. Dats a fack.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What bothers me is when he departs from prediction and gets into advocacy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as in the examples above.  If he wants to prevent me from using encryption</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the net, or he tries to convince people that they face a choice between</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy and freedom (with the implication that they must forbid privacy</i><br>
<i>&gt;in order to retain freedom), I see threats to my own freedom of choice</i><br>
<i>&gt;and action.  I am not trying to demonize Brin or exaggerate his views.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do, however, view his ideas as dangerous in their implications.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, Hal.  Like the cypherpunks NEVER advocated anything!  ;-)<br>
Can the sanctimony, eh?<br>
<p>
Get this, Hal.  Whether or not you admit it, you and I are very much the<br>
same... individualist eccentrics who know in our hearts that we would be<br>
squashed flat in any society that practiced traditional human<br>
authoritarianism, because with our big mouths we'd harrangue the priests<br>
and kings til they hung us!  Each of us feels a desperate need to defend<br>
freedom's ramparts.  You perceive the best defense as giving all the po'<br>
folks armor plate and masks to walk around in, saying this will keep the<br>
mighty from harming us'ns.<br>
<p>
I say, give the masses light sabers and make the kings and priests and rich<br>
men walk around in their skivvies like the rest of us.<br>
<p>
I leave it to readers to decide which sounds more plausible. *<br>
<p>
DB<br>
<p>
*Here's a clue.  Which method has contemporary America used?  Now tell me<br>
which ancient empire you'd rather have been born in.<br>
