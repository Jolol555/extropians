From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Your numbers are wrong. The cars would be going at their very slowest at</i><br>
<i>&gt; their highest altitude (read keplers law) and fastest at the ground. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am actually concerned that they wont be going fast enough at geosynch,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as they need to be going slow enough to fall back to earth, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; staying in geosynch, even though at apogee they will be tangential to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the geosynch orbit. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, sorry, you are right about my numbers.  I redid my calculations<br>
and got a lower differential, but I will wait and see what you get.<br>
I do understand that the cars in the transfer orbit are going slower<br>
than the geosynch orbit at apogee.  But I miscalculated the speed of the<br>
geosynch station.  I now get a value of about 2800 mps.  The differential<br>
clearly can't be greater than that.<br>
<p>
My new improved calculations suggest that orbital velocity at perigee<br>
is 10000 mps, and since apogee is about 6 times larger, by Kepler's law<br>
the speed must be about 1/6 as much or about 1700 mps.  This would lead<br>
to a differential of about 1100 mps, with the station going faster than<br>
the cars in its orbital direction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Opening my _Introduction to Space Dynamics_ by William Tyrrell Thomson,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I see that my deduction is right. Essentially, the cars will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; following a Hohmann transfer orbit, with lower orbit tangential point at</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth ground (perigee) and upper point at Geosynch station, where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; velocity of the cars would be less than the velocity of the station, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; the station would catch up to the cars as they reach their peaks, add a</i><br>
<i>&gt; little momentum to keep them, and then drop them off the back, regaining</i><br>
<i>&gt; the momentum when they are returning a car. If you drop off a car every</i><br>
<i>&gt; time you pick up a car, you lose or gain zero momentum at the station.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Give me a little time and I'll give you some accurate velocity</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculations. If your equations are right, I think that you just have</i><br>
<i>&gt; apogee and perigee mixed up.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I am not sure how the geometry will work in terms of the station<br>
"catching up" to the cars.  During the transfer, the station and the<br>
earth will have rotated to new positions.  That means that each launched<br>
car is in a different elliptical orbit (in the non-rotating frame).  You<br>
will need to launch the cars from a point counter-clockwise from the<br>
point opposite to the station, and receive them from a point clockwise from<br>
the opposition point.  How far these offsets are will depend on how long<br>
it takes to reach geosynch orbit, how much the earth rotates in that time.<br>
