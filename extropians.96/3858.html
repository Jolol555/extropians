Not so! By being on this list and from your posts (also true for everyone<br>
here), is is clear that you greatly desire to continue to live to see and<br>
experience the very exciting and mentally rewarding future that is strongly<br>
suggested by current developments and trends. Putting some significant amount<br>
of ones income towards strengthening the "safety net" for ones life, is like<br>
insuring against the ultimate catastrophy. A possibility whose consequence is<br>
so important that it is virtually "imcomparable" with most other personal<br>
desires. IMO, the decision to do all one can to save ones life (short of<br>
harshly degrading it) is not open to relative weightings of how likely one is<br>
to need the "safety net".<br>
<p>

<p>
Not if 5 years from now you are *dead* (ie. cryopreserved so poorly that your<br>
mental faculties are not recoverable) when the $1000 you and others could have<br>
invested might have been just enough to advance the science of cryopreservation<br>
so that you are recoverable instead.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I am healthy enough that I will probably survive until uploading</i><br>

<i>&gt;wait 5 years before deciding whether there is an uploading-related</i><br>
<i>&gt;investment that will help me more than a cryopreservation investment?</i><br>
<p>
Statistically, you are correct concerning your likelihood of needing<br>
cryopreservtion in the next 5 years. Individually, do you really want to take<br>
that chance with something as important as your *life*?<br>
<p>
That you will survive without cryopreservation until uploading is possible, is<br>
IMO highly unlikely. In addition, even after the developement of computer<br>
speed, size, complexity, and software able to handle uploading (many decades<br>
away at best, IMO) the most likely approach to complete mental readout is<br>
destructive scaning of your undamaged frozen brain.<br>
