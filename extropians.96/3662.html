I got a copy of the book, "The End of the World", which discusses the<br>
"doomsday argument" at length.  This is the idea that if the human race is<br>
actually going to expand through the galaxy and become much more populous<br>
in the future, the chances are remote that we should find ourselves so<br>
early in its history when such a small fraction of the race has lived.<br>
<p>
I do have an idea for a reasonably Extropian future which is consistent<br>
with this argument being valid.  What if almost everyone in the future<br>
is a "mental descendant" of someone alive today or in the near future?<br>
That is, they all have memories which extend back to the present day.<br>
This would imply that most population growth ultimately becomes a matter<br>
of mental duplication in some form, perhaps as uploads make copies<br>
of themselves.  There could be variations where people merge their thoughts<br>
or change them, but for the argument to work they must retain a basic sense<br>
of identity back to the present.<br>
<p>
Then the doomsday argument is less effective because almost everyone<br>
throughout human history will have been exposed to this argument at around<br>
the point it was created, within a few decades of the year 2000.  Hence<br>
the fact that we are living through this moment is unsurprising since<br>
virtually everyone in history will also have lived through this moment,<br>
and have the same memories of it that we do, or soon will.<br>
<p>
I am not 100% sure this argument works; maybe the doomsdayers would<br>
suggest that even assuming my projected history is true, we should<br>
find ourselves surprised to actually be conscious at this point in our<br>
timelines, rather than at the later points when we are more numerous.<br>
However I think this assumes a model of time which is not at all clearly<br>
valid.<br>
