<p>
The structure worked for the period of time I subscribed to it (and <br>
for all I know still functions) for the following reasons:  (i) <br>
membership was based in part upon peer respect for activities in the <br>
field, (ii) there was a defined, agreed-upon mission statement for the <br>
list, (iii) the persons participating in the list had specific types of <br>
information to exchange to aid others in taking on specific tasks, <br>
(iv) the agreed-upon range of topics was not based in ideology or <br>
opinion or worldview but was based on the realities of that particular <br>
human rights problem, (v) whenever discussion ranged too far off-topic <br>
or disputes flared, persons in the group were willing to step in as <br>
moderators to call the members' attention back to the paramount <br>
goals, (vi) persons on the list were accustomed to operating in <br>
concensus-based decisionmaking groups.<br>
