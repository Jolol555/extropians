<p>
I'd say these criteria are met by most of the experiments in the<br>
tradition I'm involved with (experimental economics). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nope, there is plenty of experimentation in astronomy and geology.  Didn't</i><br>

<p>
Um, no.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the physical sciences, you can usually test one variable at a time.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't dispute your claim that often you need to vary more than one thing at</i><br>
<i>&gt;a time.  The point is you shouldn't start doing that until after you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;firm understanding (verified through experimentation) of what happens when</i><br>
<i>&gt;you vary each thing alone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem with the social sciences is that there are external forces</i><br>
<i>&gt;varying many things *all* of the time.  It's virtually impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;isolate any single factor.  For example, how do you design a rigorous</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment to determine whether giving welfare to unwed, teenage mothers</i><br>
<i>&gt;will reduce, increase, or have no impact on criminal activity among their</i><br>
<i>&gt;children when they grow up?</i><br>
<p>
You can bring a small number of people into a lab and run an<br>
experiment on them, and then do it again tommorow and get similar<br>
results.  You can also vary just one aspect of your experiment.<br>
<p>
 Of course the new people are different, and even the same<br>
people would be in different moods, etc.  But you're going to say you<br>
can't do social science because of that, you'll have to dump medical<br>
science too.  Same people, same variance, just asking different questions.<br>
<p>
How do you run a rigorous experiment to say what any specific welfare<br>
bill would do in any specific state?  Maybe you can't.  But that<br>
doesn't mean you can't do other things.<br>
