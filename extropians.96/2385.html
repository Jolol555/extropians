The topic of getting a computer virus through one's e-mail was brought up and <br>
then discredited, and then Ian Goddard asked, "What about a file attached to <br>
an email ?  These files are loaded<br>
onto my hardrive like any file, and a virus, as I understand, is basicaly an <br>
exe file. As far as I can see, one of those attached files can be an exe virus <br>
file. How is this not so?"<br>
<p>
You are right, Ian, a virus could be in an attached executable (.exe) file.  <br>
But it is nothing more than data until your computer actually runs it AS an <br>
executable file.  A virus can't infect your computer without being run by your <br>
computer.  So, yes, you can receive a virus through your e-mail, but it will <br>
be completely dormant until it is run as an executable program.  You can <br>
examine the virus with various software programs and figure out its exact <br>
sequence of 1's and 0's, but until you actually RUN the thing, it is <br>
completely harmless.<br>
