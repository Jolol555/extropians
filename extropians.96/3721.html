<i>&gt;         Do you mean no humans will survive?  There are going to be a lot more</i><br>
<i>&gt; people than just the amish who have no desire to transcend.  Probably a </i><br>
<i>&gt; majority won't want to, especially if nano has already defeated the mean old</i><br>
<i>&gt; grim reaper.  Are the laggards to be squashed like bugs? </i><br>
<p>
The Gentle Seduction of Humanity:<br>
<p>
"How would you like a better memory?"<br>
<p>
"You're really missing a lot of obvious stuff, you know.  Wouldn't you<br>
like a few more neurons?"<br>
<p>
"Well, you just can't understand THAT unless you let us install this new<br>
cognitive module."<br>
<p>
Think of it as pushing crack in reverse.<br>
You don't necessarily have to Transcend or perish - in the short term.<br>
<p>
After a thousand years... or a billion years... or 10^100 years ...<br>
or 10^(10^100) years... or 3^^^3 years ... or 3^^^^3 years...<br>
(Arrow notation explained at<br>
<a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#big">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#big</a> -<br>
3^^^3 is equal to an exponential tower of threes 3^(3^(3...))) seven<br>
billion threes tall - or more precisely 3^27 threes tall.)<br>
<p>
After 3^^^3 years you've either Transcended or gone into an eternal<br>
loop.  After 3^^^^3 years it doesn't matter if you're only mortal<br>
because the background hum of your neurons will have Transcended.<br>
<p>
Immortality means just that, living FOREVER and EVER and EVER...<br>
If you don't do it as a Power, your soul would burn away after the first<br>
few billion years, maybe even sooner.  I don't even want to think about<br>
living for any *real* length of time - say Graham's number of years - as<br>
a mortal.  What a horrible thought.  Death might be preferable.<br>
<p>
In the long run...<br>
The *really* long run...<br>
Humanity just isn't an option.<br>
