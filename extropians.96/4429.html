<i>&gt; I think that another big problem with this surveilance technology is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it is so easy to forge video, and it's getting constantly easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; With enough time and money you can make everybody do anything. How will</i><br>
<i>&gt; you ensure when something was taped, if it has been edited, morphed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; retouched or in any way altered. You only have to be avare of a camera</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make use of it in your own interrest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Will cameras cover every concievable angle? How many cameras would that</i><br>
<i>&gt; take? What would the storage reqirements be for that amont of video? How</i><br>
<i>&gt; do we verify the content?</i><br>
<p>
Thats the easy part. Have a reverse PGP encoding on the time/date and<br>
sumcheck information. Reverse PGP being where the ability to encode the<br>
data is known only to the camera, while ANYBODY can read the output.<br>
Doctoring of the video file will result in a file size different from<br>
the encoded sumcheck data, which would indicate inadmissible evidence.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If we started to depend on video for justice/truce we would see so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; false examples that we wouldn't believe them anymore.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A bulletproof surveilance society is not technical possible!!!! It's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; downright stupid an uninformed idea. There will be more of it of course</i><br>
<i>&gt; as everybody buys cameras and point them out of their windows. But total</i><br>
<i>&gt; recall? Never!</i><br>
<p>
Using the above scheme (total survellance with reverse PGP video<br>
coding), we could have total openness of ones activities with total<br>
privacy of one's throughts with PGP. Thus individuals could think<br>
whatever they wished, but to act lays you bare.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Beside that, the democracy rest upon the protection of the individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt; How much is that protection worth if a minor group of persons cannot do</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that's not *approved* by the majority. (Courtrooms exists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; among other reasons, to prevent the majority from having complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; control. If not it would be easier to fix societys problems with guns.)</i><br>
<p>
What is important is a judiciary that understands that as  the foudner<br>
of Hustler magazine says, "freedom of expression is not to protect the<br>
words you love but the words you hate". As long as this rule is applied<br>
rigorously, a totally open and totally free society can exist. When it<br>
does not, freedom does not.<br>
