<p>
I assume you mean _Schindler's List_ the Spielberg movie based on Thomas<br>
Keneally's book. I read the book, skipped the movie. Neither work makes a<br>
joke of the Holocaust. In fact the book (and I assume the movie - based on<br>
numerous reviews) are moving discourses on a horrible chapter in history.<br>
Holocaust survivors and their descendants as well as anyone outraged by<br>
this tragedy have often expressed the sentiment "Never again!" To that end<br>
there are many efforts at widespread public education. The book &amp; movie do<br>
that in a very eloquent way and reach a vast audience. This is to be<br>
commended on Santayana's premise that those who fail to learn from history<br>
are doomed to repeat it.<br>
<p>
Now, what is wrong with making a profit on the endeavor? It could be argued<br>
that they should be entitled to additional profit for the educational<br>
service rendered in addition to the entertainment value.<br>
<p>
Every author/artist gets paid for producing a work, often in proportion to<br>
the number of people who access it. This is true for works of fiction and<br>
works of history, diversionary works as well as enlightening works.<br>
<p>
Are you saying they are not entitled to remuneration or are you objecting<br>
to excessive remuneration?<br>
<p>
Or do you think the profit should have been donated to some worthy cause?<br>
(I have no idea if Spielberg or Keneally have or haven't done so.)<br>
<p>
I understand this is a visceral response to a highly emotionally charged<br>
subject. I'm not trying to start an argument but I would like to know why<br>
you are upset at making a profit from this film. <br>
<p>
What about Mel Brooks? His films often make jokes about anti-semitism and<br>
nazism (remember "Spingtime for Hitler" the play at the heart of _The<br>
Producers_?) as well as other sacred cows.<br>
<p>
