<i>&gt; &gt;Being able to "jack in" to cyberspace is only marginally useful if </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you don't have the processing power to go with it.  Sure, you may </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have access to vast quantities of information, but if you are still </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;processing it or thinking about it at tissue speeds then you aren't </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;much better off.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why not come up with a bio/silicon brain which contains bits of both so as</i><br>
<i>&gt; to speed up the whole. Both bio and silicon both have their pros so why not</i><br>
<i>&gt; add both together and make one dual medium (dm) brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Possible, but you still have to consider Amdahl's law.  The actual <br>
speed increase will be far less than you expect as long as you still <br>
have tissue components.  Tissue, although massively parallel, has <br>
some severe latency problems.  It would represent a serious <br>
bottleneck for any sequential processing.<br>
