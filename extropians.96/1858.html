<p>
IAN: Yes, exactly . . .  [ but ]<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; ...the problem comes when they get too greedy </i><br>
<i>  &gt; and try to make more profit than they need, </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Therein arises a key question: <br>
<p>
        Who is to determine the proper level of " need " ?<br>
        ^^^<br>
Each person measures their own need. I cannot know everything <br>
about the specific needs of even those right around me, and <br>
even less about the needs of people in the next city, county, <br>
or country. However, for equitable distribution of wealth to <br>
ever be a reality someone MUST have such GLOBAL knowledge<br>
upon which to measure proper levels of "need."<br>
<p>
That "someone" will be a central cabal of economic planners. <br>
These planners will, by human nature, exploit the masses for <br>
personal gain through economic / social control and command. <br>
<p>
Private property claims can be enforced <br>
locally, requiring only LOCAL knowledge. <br>
<p>
  ERGO: Private property does NOT <br>
  require a central State.<br>
<p>
Collectivist social theory requires a central <br>
cabal with GLOBAL knowledge, that is to say, <br>
with knowledge derived from a broad section <br>
of socail indicators and incomes, from which<br>
"equitable" distributions are determined and <br>
based upon which legal decrees are issued.<br>
<p>
  ERGO: Collectivized property <br>
  require a central State by design.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Furthermore, the collectivists theory of the <br>
" socail contract, " that is defined as a <br>
personal debt to the socail welfare that <br>
abolishes any concept of private ownership, <br>
weaves a logical and factual LEGAL web of <br>
social debt that binds all people to one<br>
another and in turn binds them to the <br>
central cabal of planners that oversee <br>
the allocation of social debt, who are <br>
know as are "The People's" Party, <br>
or the slave masters.<br>
<p>
 On the other hand:<br>
<p>
The free market price system spontaneously transmits <br>
the necessary information for local planers -- owners --<br>
to adjust their activity toward to service of consumer, <br>
i.e., socail, need. The free market society is run <br>
by the invisible hand, the invisible hand is the<br>
invisible planner, is the mind of the masses.<br>
The free market is the spontaneous and<br>
decentrally directed collective.<br>
