<i>&gt; We need to go public more often to spread our memes ANY WAY</i><br>

<p>
Why stop there?  My friend Jaga, the Hare Krishna devotee, told me <br>
she used to collect more than a thousand dollars a day at the Denver <br>
Airport; several thousand on a good day.  And that was more than 20 <br>
years ago, when a thousand dollars was more money than it is now.  <br>
<p>
Chris, why don't you go to the L.A. airport, wearing an Extropy t-shirt <br>
or some kind of Extropian costume (use your imagination), and ask for <br>
donations?  <br>
<p>
You can also just go to public places and approach people.  In the <br>
1970s the Moonies developed this into a science.  They seem to have <br>
faded away, but Christian evangelists still approach people.  Last <br>
summer I spent a lot of time in Huntington Beach.  One afternoon I was <br>
approached five different times by Christians who wanted me to come <br>
to a revival meeting.  The fifth time, when the guy asked me if I was a <br>
Christian, I said "No, I'm a Satanist," and a very interesting conversation <br>
ensued.  <br>
<p>
There is no use being shy.  Go public!  Spread your memes ANY WAY <br>
POSSIBLE!!  <br>
