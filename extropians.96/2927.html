Sexy &amp; beautiful = ability of prey to attract the hunter? Somehow, I just<br>
know you're not involved in a meaningful relationship.<br>
<p>
Most men are not sexy? Duh! Some men are not sexy because their higher<br>
brain functions are inabled. The earth is full of poised, confident,<br>
ingenuous, beautiful men willing to learn, grow, and to take the risk of<br>
equal responsibility and caring. Life is not a hunting party. Like attracts<br>
like.<br>

<p>
First, nobody has THAT much money! The mating chances of the inabled are<br>
equal to 3-second voluntary copulation with similar prey - with dissimilar<br>
prey, by force. If mating means impregnating the prey, fine. If mating<br>
means a bonding partnership, the guy is a loser.<br>

I'm going to slap your mind buster! No, come to think of it, I'll need a<br>
12-gauge to hit that tiny target. Pray prey.<br>
