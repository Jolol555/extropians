<p>
Hah, and given its speed, RC4 could well be a standard algorithm.<br>
Actually, it is -- Netscape's SSLs.  So much for the usefulness of<br>
fingerprinting.<br>
<p>
As far as I can tell, this entire subthread arose from Eugene saying<br>
that it would still be useful to build weak encryption into TCP/IP; Lyle<br>
challenged this saying that those who then used strong encryption would<br>
be drawing attention to themselves.<br>
<p>
(1) Lyle's argument rests on method identification being much easier<br>
than method breaking.  Eugene denies this point above; I don't think John<br>
Clark's responses have been addressin this poine.<br>
<p>
(2) Lyle's argument also rests on there being a diverse population of<br>
messages; most guared with a standard weak algorithm, some bearing PGP<br>
headers.  But if the strong crypto was happening underneath the weak, as<br>
it would if some method was built into TCP/IP, then any fingerprinting<br>
should be obscured; wide-target eavesdroppers would have to decrypt<br>
everything routinely to find the strongly guarded messages.<br>
<p>
(3) Given the current Internet community, I think it likely that TCP/IP<br>
will either not change at all (whups) or have strong crypto built into<br>
it.  The paranoid could then wrap their messages themselves before<br>
putting them onto the Net.  Not pretty for eavesdroppers.<br>
<p>
Have I missed anything?<br>
