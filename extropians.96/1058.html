I agree that some kind of momentous, unprecedented event is imminent.  <br>
<p>
Calling this a "singularity" implies that we can't understand it.  I see no <br>
reason to start out with that assumption.  It may well turn out that we <br>
can't understand it.  I am willing to accept that outcome.  Maybe it will <br>
be like the peak of an acid trip.  Fine, I will enjoy the roller coaster ride <br>
to infinity.  But for the time being, I am going to make every effort to <br>
understand what's going on.  I am going to try to place it into the same <br>
causal nexus as everything else.   My working hypothesis is that <br>
everything fits into the same causal nexus, and can be understood with <br>
the same logic.  (Logic, however, is far from a finished subject.)  <br>
<p>
I sometimes think of what's coming as the "crystallization."   I agree <br>
that it will involve a proliferation of new life forms, like the Cambrian <br>
explosion.  -- Not just new organisms in the usual sense of the word, but <br>
entirely new forms of life.  Corporations, for example, are a new kind of <br>
living entity which didn't exist 300 years ago.  <br>

John Clark writes <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; None of our previous technological advances improved us, </i><br>
<i>&gt; they improved our tools, in the singularity we become our tools </i><br>
<i>&gt; and that is fundamentally new. That's why it's called a </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Singularity", there  is nothing else like it.</i><br>
<p>
What's the difference between improving us and improving our tools?  <br>
Aren't tools just extensions of ourselves?  All the tools I have access to <br>
could be thought of as my "body" in mechanical space.  They constitute <br>
my means of operating on the world, including my physical body.  This <br>
entire apparatus can be improved on many levels.  My tool-body already <br>
includes tools for improving my biological body -- exercise equipment, <br>
vitamins, drugs, chelation therapy.  My access to my cells is going to <br>
become more and more fine-grained in the coming decades, but I don't <br>
see why this is fundamentally new.  My toolkit also includes tools that <br>
can be used to improve my mind, as opposed to my brain -- universities, <br>
libraries, computers, the internet.  This apparatus will also (we hope) <br>
become more fine-grained, and I may be able to improve my thinking to <br>
unprecedented levels of clarity.  <br>
<p>
Why is any of this unique or incomprehensible?  Isn't all this just a <br>
continuation of what we are already doing?  <br>
<p>
Referring back to one of your earlier posts, on August 23 you said:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) could walk upright as well as </i><br>
<i>&gt; you or me, and like modern humans, she had short fingers and a </i><br>
<i>&gt; fully opposable thumb.  This was not very good for climbing trees but </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's great for precision gripping. From the neck down Lucy was </i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty modern, but her brain was only about as big as a modern day </i><br>
<i>&gt; chimp. After Lucy the brain increased in size at an enormous rate, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and I don't think that would have happened if Lucy didn't have </i><br>
<i>&gt; such a good hand, and nobody understands why Evolution gave her </i><br>
<i>&gt; that good hand.</i><br>
<p>
Hands and intelligence evolved together.  They will continue to <br>
evolve together.  So, let's make better and better tools of all kinds, <br>
and use them!  <br>

<i>                &gt;When somebody claims that goods produced by molecular          </i><br>
       <br>
<i>                &gt;manufacturing will be free, ask: why are things not free now?  </i><br>
  <br>
to which you replied <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A few things are free now, like water from a public water fountain. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course  the water is not really free, it's just too cheap to be worth </i><br>
<i>&gt; the bother of charging for it.    </i><br>
<p>
The fountain is a small part of a huge water system, including pipes, <br>
tanks, reservoirs, and in some places purification plants and aqueducts.  <br>
All of this does cost something.  In New York City, the official policy <br>
for a long time was that a civilized city provides water for its people.  <br>
There were no water meters.  In the 1960's, when the city's budget <br>
fell into disarray, they had second thoughts about free water, and <br>
investigated the possibility of charging for it.  They had to weigh the <br>
one-time cost of installing meters all over the city against the <br>
continuing cost of providing free water.  I don't know what they finally <br>
decided; I left the city before this issue was resolved.  <br>
<p>
My point is that everything costs something.  This is just a natural fact, <br>
like friction in physics.  It isn't going to change just because <br>
manufacturing gets more and more fine-grained.  Physical friction may <br>
be reduced almost to zero at some points in the manufacturing process, <br>
but the main cause of economic friction is human inertia and stupidity, <br>
which will always be with us.  People seem to assume that we can have <br>
artificial intelligence without also having artificial stupidity.  I doubt it.  <br>

<i>&gt; Silk is expensive because if the price was any lower then </i><br>
<i>&gt; the demand would outstrip the supply. </i><br>
<p>
In general, the price of any product is what it is because if it were any <br>
lower then the demand would outstrip the supply (and vice versa).   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reason diamonds are expensive is that they don't grow on trees,  </i><br>
<p>
What if they grew on trees that only grow half a mile underground in <br>
certain geological formations that only occur in a few places in the <br>
world?  <br>
<p>
A product is expensive when it is (a) difficult to obtain and (b) <br>
perceived as better than the alternatives.  Silk is difficult to obtain <br>
because, as you say, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The silk worm can not reproduce itself in just any simple environment, </i><br>
<i>&gt; only in a very specific,  very  complex one. </i><br>
  <br>
Exactly.   Just like orange trees.  Just like anything that grows.  <br>
Diamond trees, if they existed, would only grow in certain environments, <br>
and diamonds would still cost something.  <br>
<p>
Any organism grows in a certain optimal environment, which may or <br>
may not be easy to create.  Some organisms will always be easier to <br>
cultivate than others.  Some chemical processes will always be easier to <br>
set up than others.  This is a general fact that isn't going to change <br>
just because manufacturing becomes more fine-grained, or just because <br>
we learn how to create new organisms.  Some products will come from <br>
organisms or processes that push the envelope of what's possible, and <br>
these products will be expensive.  There will always be expensive <br>
products side by side with cheap products.   We will always have both <br>
designer silk shirts  that cost hundreds of dollars, and polyester shirts <br>
that are just as good for most purposes, selling for a few dollars.  <br>
<p>
Assume we have molecular manufacturing, in the sense that we can <br>
grow (some) products out of diamondoid materials.  Nanites assemble <br>
them according to our specifications, like termites building an ant hill <br>
according to the specifications that are wired into them.  These nanites <br>
are going to require programming and design, just like any other <br>
fine-grained apparatus.   Some programmers and designers will <br>
do their jobs supremely well, and produce masterpieces of <br>
whatever they are making;  other programmers and designers will <br>
give less attention to their tasks, and they will produce cheaper, generic <br>
diamondoid products.   <br>
<p>
The economy will continue to adjust itself so that typical <br>
working people can afford typical mass-market products, and <br>
wealthier people can afford carriage-trade products.  <br>
<p>
Molecular manufacturing will emerge within the same capitalist <br>
economy that we live in now.  Factories will still be factories.  <br>
They will require elaborate buildings and millions of dollars' worth of <br>
specialized equipment.  They will employ biotechnologists with rare and <br>
expensive skills.  Factories will still be owned by investors who want to <br>
get their investment back.  They will produce products for the market, <br>
and buy inputs from the market.  The managers will still understand the <br>
concept of planned obsolescence.  <br>
<p>
In other words the advent of molecular manufacturing will merely be <br>
an adjustment within the existing economy.  The economy itself won't <br>
cease to exist.  <br>
<p>
I wrote, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Now, could anything smaller than the entire economy make   </i><br>
<i>&gt;  *anything*?    </i><br>
<p>
To which you replied <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, much, much smaller.  </i><br>
<p>
A genie machine is equivalent to the economy of a large industrialized <br>
country.  <br>
<p>
It is true that a genie machine could be smaller than the world economy <br>
(if you are willing to fudge a little and allow imports of rare minerals).  <br>
The American economy is a genie machine, to a close approximation.  <br>
We can produce just about everything we want, and the few exceptions <br>
that we have to import (VCR's and so forth) could be made in America <br>
if we really wanted to.  A somewhat smaller country such as Japan <br>
could make practically anything.  But I think that's the lower limit.  <br>
I don't think a country as small as Taiwan or Norway could have <br>
an economy complex enough to make anything.  In a genie machine <br>
there are a hundred million jobs that need to be done.  <br>
<p>
So far I have been talking about the size of a genie machine, where <br>
size is measured by complexity -- the number of jobs.  What about size <br>
in the sense of spatial extent?  <br>
<p>
Suppose human beings can be miniaturized.  I don't believe this for a <br>
minute, but for the sake of argument let's assume it.  Suppose the entire <br>
population of Japan can fit into a volume the size of a beach ball, and <br>
all their tools, factories and infrastructure are also miniaturized to fit <br>
into that volume.  Assume further that they can import whatever <br>
materials and energy they need.  In that case, would the Japanese <br>
economy still be a genie machine?  <br>
<p>
In a certain sense, I guess it would.  They could still produce an <br>
enormous variety of goods for their own use.  They could make <br>
practically "anything", at least on their own scale.  Whether they could <br>
produce goods that would be of use to us is another matter.  <br>
<p>
Could the Japan that actually exists, the macroscopic Japan, produce <br>
something comparable in size to the Japanese islands themselves?   <br>
What would induce them to even attempt such a thing?   <br>
<p>
If the beach-ball Japan is going to be a genie machine from *our* <br>
point of view, not just from their own point of view, they would have to <br>
make objects comparable in size to their own beach ball -- or even <br>
many orders of magnitude larger, if they are literally going to make <br>
"anything."  A genie machine has to be able to make ships, airports,  <br>
cities -- anything.  Asking the beach-ball Japan to make a ship would be <br>
like asking the actual Japan to make something the size of the earth.  <br>
<p>
A beach-ball Japan would find some niche in the economy.  A hundred <br>
million tiny humans could certainly do things that couldn't be done any <br>
other way.  They could repair our cells.  They could (if they wanted to) <br>
make themselves useful in many ways.  But they wouldn't replace <br>
macroscopic industry.  They would be an extension of the economy <br>
as it presently exists, not a replacement of it.  They would be just <br>
another part of the genie machine, not the whole thing. <br>
