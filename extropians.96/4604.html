Sounds to me like the easiest way to create a supernova, 'Gene.<br>
<p>
As with the Sun and all the planets, Jupiter is a balance of forces,<br>
- the pull of gravity causing a contraction of all material in Jupiter<br>
and raising pressure and temperature to counter-balance gravity.<br>
Jupiter hasn't yet accreted enough mass to become a star; i.e. its <br>
mass (and gravity) is not enough to raise temperature &amp; pressure at its<br>
centre sufficiently to generate large scale nuclear fusion reactions.<br>
Another billion years maybe and it may have slowly accumulated enough <br>
extra mass to change that balance, with gradually higher temperatures <br>
able to start and sustain fusion and cause Jupiter to expand slowly,<br>
balancing the newly higher temperatures.  In other words, Jupiter <br>
becomes a star, and the solar system becomes (yet another) binary <br>
star system.  Note that this process is a gradual transition.<br>
<p>
But if you nuke Jupiter (deeply enough to get in contact with highly<br>
pressurized hydrogen), then you trigger a vast nuclear fusion reaction<br>
and SUDDENLY change the balance of forces holding the planet together.<br>
In short, a very big bang.  The remnant Jupiter less than half size.<br>
<p>
A hydrogen bomb on Earth terminates because it runs out of hydrogen,<br>
(even deep under the sea, which of course contains hydrogen).<br>
But with Jupiters' vast dense hydrogen supply, and gravity holding<br>
it in place ready for ignition/fusion, it's just one big big BOMB.<br>
Perhaps big enough to vaporize the other planets or at least their<br>
surface features.  Don't bother making a will.  :-{<br>
<p>
Interesting idea 'Gene.  You're not a pyromaniac by any chance??  ;-)<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Graham<br>
