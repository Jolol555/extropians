<i>&gt;&gt; Extropianism has never claimed or sought to be a complete philosophy.</i><br>

<i>&gt;Why not?  Why settle for anything less?</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps because it's not available yet, and will be a long time in the<br>
building. Perhaps because some of us view "philosophy" as just a short-hand<br>
name for "the set of all research programs we don't have a solid handle on<br>
yet", and because some of us expect that this set will never be reduced to<br>
the empty set.<br>

<i>&gt;One of my heroes, whose name I won't mention here, said</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  The aim of human evolution is to attain a mystical vision of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure "mystical" is the word I would use, but I agree that</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution does have a purpose, and his way of expressing it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the best I have seen.  I might amend it as follows:  The aim of</i><br>
<i>&gt;human evolution is to attain a complete vision of the universe, in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;all causal relations are manifest, down to the roots of causality.</i><br>
<p>
Human beings have diverse purposes, but I see no evidence that the cosmos<br>
has a purpose. To attribute a single purpose to cosmic evolution is IMHO an<br>
inaccurate anthropomorphism.<br>
<p>
I doubt that your "complete vision" is attainable, because such a complete<br>
vision would have to make manifest all causal relations *including* the<br>
causal chains that pass through the internals of the people "having" the<br>
complete vision. By the time we have a complete understanding of all causal<br>
relations in the physical world, in the human brain, and in the evolution<br>
of human cultures, I'm sure we'll have developed the ability to perceive<br>
and think about even more complex structures which we cannot even imagine<br>
at this point.<br>
<p>
In order to understand and explain things, we develop new conceptual<br>
resources. But those conceptual resources themselves are structures within<br>
brains which have causal effects on the world which in turn need to be<br>
explained. Even if physics has a bottom and a top (and I've seen no<br>
evidence of this yet), the exploration of cultural evolution has no end.<br>
Mathematics certainly has no end in sight. As we increasingly refine our<br>
ability to ferret out useful new historical data out of what once seemed<br>
nothing but noise, history keeps growing faster than the passage of time.<br>
The practice of engineering creates complex new structures with rules of<br>
their own that need to be understood on their own terms even if in theory<br>
they can be reduced to physical laws the same way the human beings can be,<br>
in theory.<br>
<p>
Once you introduce life and technology into a universe, then the complexity<br>
of that universe will necessarily grow faster than the capacity of the<br>
living beings in that universe to comprehend it, because their very efforts<br>
to comprehend the existing complexity will increase the complexity of that<br>
universe even faster. This is my personal formulation of the Law of<br>
Extropy. (Yes, that's tongue-in-cheek.)<br>
<p>
Some people hate this idea. They want to have everything locked up solid in<br>
their minds and safely stowed. I love this idea. For me, this idea means<br>
that I'll never have to worry about getting bored, not even if I become a<br>
Jupiter brain. For me, this idea is a source of deep joy.<br>
<p>
(Don't let this idea lead to "rapture of the future"... just because the<br>
complexity of the universe will grow faster than our ability to comprehend<br>
it all, doesn't mean that the complexity of the universe will grow<br>
inevitably. It just means that if the complexity of the universe shrinks,<br>
our ability to comprehend it will recede before that tide. So if we want<br>
the complexity of the universe to keep increasing, we have to keep working<br>
at it. Think thermonuclear war for an example of our ability to create new<br>
science/math/philosophy shrinking faster than the complexity of the stuff<br>
we want to understand is shrinking.)<br>
<p>
As for "measure", if any of you mathematicians out there have come up with<br>
a surefire measure of complexity (as distinguished from randomness), well,<br>
I'd be interested in hearing about it. And I guess what I'm really talking<br>
about here is "stable complexity" or "homeostatic complexity", but here my<br>
ideas get vague fast and all I have to say is that I really need to study<br>
some more maths.<br>
