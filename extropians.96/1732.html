	A sufficiently advanced intelligence (say human-level) might <br>
decide <br>
that refurbishing its stellar neighborhood is  simply not a good idea. <br>
No matter <br>
how smart it might get, it must still always wonder: is there something <br>
out there <br>
that is even smarter? Might that something  prefer to exterminate its <br>
space-time <br>
neighbors? Does it fret about _its_  possible neighbors, and their <br>
intentions?<br>
If this is the case, or even if it is _perceived_ to be the case by the <br>
posited <br>
extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), said ETI would take every <br>
precaution to <br>
maintain a very low profile, even at the expense of foregoing potential <br>
resource <br>
grabs.<br>
	The first few civilizations to arise after the Big Bang (which <br>
may <br>
include us) would have _no way_ of knowing (barring superluminal <br>
messaging) <br>
that they were indeed the first, and so would have to proceed under the <br>
prudent <br>
assumption that there are others out there who might not be friendly.<br>
	Any stellar-scale engineering project can attract unwelcome <br>
attention. <br>
Dyson Spheres make particularly easy targets- just nova the hearthfire. <br>
Perhaps <br>
use a relativistic black hole or brown dwarf, launched from a Great Void. Or <br>
perhaps a large, relativistic nanoprobe phalanx [Bishop 96]would <br>
suffice to <br>
initiate fusion in the structure of the Dyson Sphere itself, or at <br>
least give <br>
everything in the neighborhood a comprehensive radiation bath.<br>
	In October, 1991, a telescope called the Fly Eye [REF] (because <br>
of its <br>
appearance) picked up a most unusual signal. This event consisted of a <br>
single <br>
particle, probably a proton, smashing into Earth’s atmosphere with an <br>
energy as <br>
far greater than any conceivable natural process could produce as a <br>
{{supernova <br>
is to the meanderings of a bacterium}}. Although the energy of that <br>
particle was <br>
also vastly in excess of anything we can produce, it would be foolish <br>
to rule out <br>
the possibility of an artificial origin. A long enough (say, the <br>
diameter of the <br>
Solar System) linear particle accelerator may be able to produce this <br>
kind of <br>
energy (10^20+ EV). Interestingly enough, the proton could not have <br>
come <br>
from more than a hundred million light years away, due to virtual <br>
photon <br>
exchange with the cosmic background radiation [REF].<br>
Now why would someone in our neighborhood, as it were, go to the <br>
trouble of <br>
generating such a thing, in sufficient quantity that one actually ends <br>
up striking <br>
Earth (probably by accident). One particular reason does come to mind.<br>
<p>
The Loud Mouths<br>
<p>
	If Civilization A were to rig up a star as a Universe-wide radio <br>
transmitter [Hanson 96] (this is something we are technically almost <br>
able to do), <br>
then Civilization B might come along and nova that star, for a variety <br>
reasons <br>
(naturally, they would try to make it look like an accident).<br>
A gedanken: If you were the potentially immortal possessor of a Universe-wide <br>
transmitter, what would you broadcast (besides the inherent “here I am, come <br>
and get me”)? Mind you,  your technical prowess can be deduced from <br>
that <br>
same radio signal and its content, unless you are clever enough to <br>
disguise it,<br>
which requires you to be absolutely certain of the disguise (this would <br>
be done <br>
to lure your lessers to their doom). You had also better be quite sure <br>
that no <br>
entity within range, in this case the entire known  Universe, would be <br>
willing <br>
and able to destroy you. And how are you to find _that_ out?<br>
	To the question of what sort of entities might do such supremely <br>
horrific deeds, one hardly need look to the stars for an answer.<br>
<p>
Radio Shells<br>
<p>
	It may be that we decide not to allow artificial EMR to leave the <br>
solar <br>
system any more. The resulting expanding sphere becomes a spherical <br>
shell, say <br>
a light century or two thick, with a correspondingly lowered <br>
probability of <br>
intercept. <br>
	Space may be populated with these expanding “radio shells”, <br>
passing <br>
through one another like ghosts in the void. The emitters either decide <br>
to cease <br>
unilaterally, or something from the dark comes and does it for -and to- <br>
them.<br>
	The leading surface of these bubbles would be weak and sporadic, <br>
consisting of the odd radio experiment and early transmissions. As one <br>
passes <br>
by, the signals would become increasingly sophisticated and broaden in <br>
bandwidth. A listener would hear the alien versions of the “Fireside <br>
Chats”, then <br>
“I Love Lucy”, rising to a crescendo of “Die Hard With a Vengeance, <br>
Then Die <br>
Some More V1” reruns, and then only silence.<br>
	Our current SETI may be confined to a lucky intercept of one of these <br>
ETI radio shells, which would then tell us the past location and development of <br>
a tech civilization. We could then say, with near certainty, that that <br>
civilization <br>
was far (post-Singularity, or exterminated by another such) ahead of <br>
ours at the <br>
time of our intercept, and thus posed a real threat to our existence, <br>
or no longer <br>
exists. If we have intercepted their shell, they or their exterminators <br>
will <br>
certainly be intercepting ours. Both civilizations may launch what they <br>
hope will <br>
be quiet, preemptive strikes against the other. This is another <br>
justification<br>
for SETI that probably is already used, in the appropriate setting <br>
(spook <br>
houses).<br>
	Perhaps we might also scale back on the HAARPesque [HAARP] style <br>
experiments, messing around with unnaturally high RF energy densities, <br>
that <br>
sort of  thing, for the same reason. Nuclear explosives can also yield <br>
a signature <br>
X-ray and gamma-ray release. However, we’ve already demonstrated a <br>
willingness to risk it all; there were some project scientists that <br>
thought the first <br>
atomic bomb might initiate a runaway chain reaction in the Earth’s <br>
atmosphere <br>
(this was also disproved on theoretical grounds- after the fact!).<br>
	As for evidence of large engineering projects, perhaps we think <br>
too <br>
small. Perhaps the Great Walls and Voids themselves are the remnants of <br>
titanic <br>
exterminations of yestergigayear.<br>
<p>
Hey Ho, Let’s Go<br>
<p>
	If we do decide to colonize, with the above in mind, it may not <br>
be wise <br>
to expand into the galaxy in a spherical manner, with direct <br>
communication  <br>
back to the homeworld. That kind of expansion would indicate the direction of <br>
the homeworld, and the rough size of the colonized volume, at every point of <br>
the expansion.  Perhaps we will use an irregular, zigzag method, with some <br>
doubling back. Still, at every new star system there is the chance of <br>
an <br>
unfriendly reception.<br>
	Maybe we will stick with microgram-class starprobes, and wipe <br>
their <br>
origin from their memory. When they grow up and hyperevolve in their <br>
new star <br>
system,  at some point they will meet their cousins and ancestors. <br>
Either they <br>
merge, or one destroys as much of the other as it can find. So then <br>
everyone is <br>
the enemy- whether of human or alien ancestry.<br>
As there is still a possibility of alien intercept, our descendants <br>
might decide that <br>
interstellar travel is imperative for assured survival, on the above <br>
grounds (not <br>
simply because the sun will die).<br>
And now a dilemma: are the starprobes allowed to retain their ancestral <br>
<p>
memories, with the danger that poses to the Launchers and others, or do <br>
they <br>
wipe it- with the result above?<br>
And if they do not that retain that memory, can they even be considered <br>
kin?<br>
<p>
The Watchers<br>
<p>
Perhaps the Great Filter [Hanson 96] can be explained by the hypothesis <br>
that the <br>
Universe is just not a friendly place.<br>
A small alien nanotech probe may already have been in our Solar System <br>
for <br>
hundred of millions of years. To a self-repairing, nanotech machine an <br>
eon is but <br>
a twinkling. Its directives might be to:<br>
1) Hide from everything.<br>
2) Observe.<br>
3) If a potential threat to the probe’s Launcher arises, then and only then <br>
neutralize that threat, and again, try to do it quietly.<br>
If this is the case, we will find out shortly. We have already passed <br>
through the <br>
first checkpoint for this scenario, by developing radio. A <br>
microgram-class self-<br>
replicating probe has had a century to grow to any size it wished to, <br>
and to <br>
create and preposition its devices in the event we attempt serious <br>
space travel.<br>
<p>
And if one, why not several, from several different “folks”? They may <br>
be playing <br>
hide-and-seek with each other, as well. It will be very easy to <br>
disguise such a <br>
probe as an ordinary asteroid, immune to every kind of remote sensing, <br>
or by <br>
using a photon-addressable phased-array cloaking device [Wouk].<br>
<p>
And so “they” may indeed be around these parts, hiding, watching, <br>
waiting.<br>
