<i> &gt; Okay, thought experiment:</i><br>

<i> &gt; We get rid of all coercive institutions, both government and corporations.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Then we see what social structures turn up. You say the natural</i><br>

<i> &gt; think our ability to cooperate was vital to our evolutionary</i><br>
<i> &gt; success. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: The flaw in your experiment is the baseless assumption <br>
that cooperation is the antithesis of trade. The error is quite<br>
clear to see: "cooperation" implies consent. Consent implies <br>
the freedom to say no.  Therefore, I will "cooperate," or<br>
say "yes," when I find the terms to be suitable = trade.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Only when a small minority obtain power through generally nasty means, can</i><br>
<i> &gt; they tell everybody else that these are the rules they must follow.     </i><br>
<p>
IAN: And how else are they going to tell people to give up<br>
the wealth they have in excess of their neighbors if not by<br>
gaining such power to compel such surrender to the collective?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Why do you equate the desire for a good life for all with central</i><br>
<i> &gt; planning. I hate and fear government just as much as you do. But I also</i><br>
<i> &gt; hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their </i><br>
<i> &gt; advertising and poison my water with their pollution. Uggh, there must be</i><br>
<i> &gt; a better way than unrestrained capitalism. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: But why should they keep all the pollution to themselves? They're <br>
spreading it around.  It's a collectivist duty to take on your share. <br>
It's your petty bourgeois notions of private property that cause you <br>
to entertain such bourgeois notions as "pollution."<br>
