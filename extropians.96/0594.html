<i> &gt; PS</i><br>
<i> &gt; It may be none of my business, and I dont know if it was your intent, but</i><br>
in<br>
<i> &gt; light of all the unfair slander and abuse Max has taken lately ( in my</i><br>
<i> &gt; opinion from people who are jealous or massively uninformed) this could be</i><br>
<i> &gt; read as yet another,  not so nice, not very well veiled - jab.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
(russel) <br>
<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Nothing of the sort!  I'm neither jealous nor uninformed.  I'm informed </i><br>
 enough to continue as a board member of ExI, even. None of this is directed<br>
 at Max; I though that was clear.  I simply take issue with those whose<br>
 first impulse in such situations is to call on someone else to do the<br>
 work of representation for them.  This was directed at Chris, not Max.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
  <br>
    Of course, I did not mean that *you* were, but as is obvious -  there are<br>
(lately) those who have been less than rational or constructive - if not<br>
blatantly ill mannered...<br>
     As I said I didnt know if your intent was to dis, but wanted to point<br>
out that it could be read as such by those seeking  to  increase the level of<br>
 negative feedback. Thank you for the clarification.<br>
