Yes it is a ripe field for innovation.  Therefore it is not obvious to<br>
me that your solution of professional credentialors will win or is best.<br>
Until you can describe an attractive plausible design along your<br>
lines, I will think the game is still quite open.  <br>

<i>&gt;The peer review I have been involved with is not as good as this proposal</i><br>

<p>
Poor choice of reviewer is not intrinsic to the current process, and<br>
evolutionary selection of journals should prefer those with<br>
editors who pick reviewers who will pick articles their readers like.<br>
<p>
I have since learned that this online journal idea lets reviewers post<br>
numerical ratings, which are averaged into a paper rating.  But since<br>
anyone can review anything, I don't have great hopes for the average<br>
quality of high-rated articles.  But it is an empirical question.<br>
