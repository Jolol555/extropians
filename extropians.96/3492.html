<i>&gt;&gt; 1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The easiest argument to understand.  Attention-catcher.</i><br>
<p>
I think "subjective years" is a bad choice of terms.  It requires a<br>
human-accessible definition.  From what I can tell, in a "subjective<br>
year" a given computing entity can do the same amount of computation<br>
as a (an average? trained?) human could do in one calendar year.  Pick<br>
a term more based in that objective measure.  Psychotics can live<br>
subjective years in varying amounts of time, and besides, the term<br>
"subjective" has a lot of baggage that you probably don't want to<br>
waste time in your form letter shaking off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Another easy argument.  Both give the flavor of the Singularity.</i><br>
<p>
How can this be easy when<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 11. Intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Part and parcel of the Singularity, but hard to convey.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 12. Runaway positive feedback of IA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Ditto.</i><br>
<p>
these are hard?  I find 11 pretty easy -- starting with chips that<br>
connect to your brain and help you calculate or just give you more<br>
memory, etc.  For some accessible ideas on this, I suggest you read _The<br>
Gentle Seduction_, a collection of short stories on nanotech, etc.,<br>
by Marc Stiegler.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 3.  Defines "Singularity."</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Having a snappy name and a simple definition is a memetic advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 4.  Is this a good thing?  Names factions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        First thing that occurs to everyone:  Will it affect me?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 5.  Doomsday faction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Seems to be the instinctive reaction; could be true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Catches reader's attention through a possible threat.</i><br>
<p>
If you can describe three factions, make this the middle one, so it<br>
gets the memetic advantage neither of being first nor of being last.<br>
Utopia, Doomsday, and Realism might be a good breakdown.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 6.  Uploading faction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Defusing the instinct; making the Singularity attractive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        We don't want federal bans on nanotech.</i><br>
<p>
Nope, sorry.  I'm an extropian and immortalist already, and _I'm_ not<br>
convinced that uploading is all that attractive -- I _like_ having<br>
a body.  Nanotech on the other hand I like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 7.  Intro to nanotechnology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Nanotechnology may be the best way of conveying the upheavals brought</i><br>
<i>&gt;        about by the Singularity.  We can't simply say that the Singularity</i><br>
<i>&gt;will</i><br>
<i>&gt;        erase human society; we have to show it.</i><br>
<p>
The people you're talking to are humans.  Most of them won't like the sound<br>
of that one bit, not to mention that it will sound millenial/apocalylptic,<br>
or like just another woo-woo "Strange Universe" segment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 8.  Nearness of nanotechnology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Short-term threats/goals get more attention.</i><br>
<p>
This I like well enough.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 9.  Nanotechnology replaces economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        SHOW that the Singularity will replace human society...</i><br>
<p>
How about "transforms" -- to a different kind of economy; say, one based<br>
on abundance rather than on scarcity.  I am convinced that economies will<br>
always exist; the forms of them that we have now may simply become obsolete.<br>
<p>
BTW -- you can't _show_ a damn thing.  You can make a more or less<br>
convincing argument that it will happen, but "show" implies concrete<br>
examples, and the whole point of the Singularity is that we don't know<br>
what will be on the other side.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 10. Gray goo problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        It's not all roses.  The reader has a right to know, and again the</i><br>
<i>&gt;        threat of destroying the planet can grab the attention, although</i><br>
<i>&gt;        not quite so much after all the false alarms.</i><br>
<p>
I'd leave this out of an introductory letter.  Alarmism is for missionaries.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 13. Replacement of human society: End of History.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The Singularity is not one of your petty memes.</i><br>
<p>
Thrillsville.  The end of history; just what I wanted.  Foo.  Show me<br>
how it will be the beginning of a new, better history, and I might<br>
want some.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 14. Singularity provides Interim Meaning of Life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Ditto.  One of the ways to hook a meme in the mind is by</i><br>
<i>&gt;        making previously established memes dependent on it.</i><br>
<p>
According to your Web page, the interim meaning of life is to get to<br>
the Singularity as soon as possible.  From your description, I'm in<br>
no hurry.  Explain to people how their lives will be incredibly, even<br>
unimaginably enriched, or this will not sound tempting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; 15. Summary: History is about to end.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The meme as we want it to spread, once all symbolic groundwork</i><br>
<i>&gt;        is laid.</i><br>
<p>
Are you aware of how easily this will get lost in the noise of crackpots<br>
standing on streetcorners with "The End Is Near" signs as the Millenium<br>
approaches?  Maybe the problem is that your symbolic groundwork isn't<br>
as solid, or as inviting to walk on, as you think.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are not giving a complete explanation!  We are not debating!</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are creating and packaging a meme and our sole goal</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that it infect a majority of the human race ASAP!</i><br>
<p>
I DO NOT want a majority of the human race infected with a "History<br>
is about to end" meme!  Singularity and nanotech would be completely<br>
lost, and only the catch-phrase would remain, and it could be just<br>
the thing to cause some nut, or some group of nuts, to try to wipe<br>
out all humans ASAP.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, the Singularity page reads like a religious tract and a<br>
math thesis mixed freely.  If that's what you want, great, but realize<br>
that most people won't have the capacity, much less the attention span,<br>
to read and understand it.<br>
<p>
I suppose I could comment further, but I've spent too much time on this<br>
already, and will probably just be denigrated for my trouble.  Oh well.<br>
As a long-time Libertarian Party member, multiple-time candidate for<br>
office, technical writer, and budding student of social psychology,<br>
I've had to deal with presenting (sometimes unpopular) ideas in a<br>
palatable and clear way, and I draw on my experiences to try to save<br>
you some frustration and disappointment.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
