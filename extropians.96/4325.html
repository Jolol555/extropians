*Apart* from that?  What about your reputation?  But that aside, I don't<br>
think it will work.  Also, if I'm not mistaken, at about the word "pay" it<br>
stopped being merely obnoxious and started being illegal.  To miscellaneous<br>
government agencies, the US Postal Service among them, I think<br>
"chain letter" + "money" = "pyramid scheme" (lambast my specifics if you<br>
like, but _I_ wouldn't try it).  I certainly wasted time (not much<br>
money, fortunately) on such things in my young and foolish days, when<br>
I knew less about both statistics and social psych.<br>

Or, in short, "Bad idea!  No donut!"<br>
