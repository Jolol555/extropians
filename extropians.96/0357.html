<i> &gt;&gt;Does anyone know of any studies (preferably with good methodology) analyzing</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;possible psychological differences between persons born the traditional way</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;vs. those born by Caesarian section?</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;The NDE experience of travelling down a tunnel into the light suggests the</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;possibility of a replaying of the birth experience. One way to investigate</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;this would be to see if all people having such an NDE were born the typical</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;way. If so, we'd have a nice explanation of the basic near death experience.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: Resulting from meditational practices, I've had the white light <br>
experience on several occasions. I was also born C section. I never <br>
saw a tunnel. Keep in mind that people have "seen the light" long <br>
before C-births, which is not say there is no connection. <br>
<p>
The while light experience is profound beyond words. More meaningful <br>
and glorious and anything else. It is like absolute 100% ecstasy <br>
filling every inch of all space and time. It is often accompanied<br>
by heavy crying, but crying in ecstacy; very strange because crying <br>
is usually associated with pain.<br>
<p>
I carefully observe and try to explain the nature of all I experience. <br>
Recently I made what may be an important observation regarding the white<br>
light experience: you may observe that as you are falling asleep there <br>
are amorphous cloud-like patterns that swim around before your eyes, often<br>
following a repeating pattern. If you've ever had a lucid dream you'll <br>
notice that it is the "stuff" that these "clouds" are made of -- millions <br>
of very small luminous particles -- that will suddenly "crystallize" into <br>
the life-like structures that compose the objects that inhabit dreams. <br>
Seeing this happen is quite wondrous; truly the brain is amazing.<br>
<p>
Well, what I observed is that the "white light" is composed of these <br>
luminous dream particles; yet, unlike pre-dreaming and dreaming, they <br>
fill every portion of one's vision with maximum and uniform luminosity. <br>
I've observed this quite clearly, seeing the transition from none, to <br>
many of the particles to their filling all vision -- with eyes closed.<br>
<p>
Obviously this suggests a biological, as opposed to "spiritual" (whatever <br>
that is) basis of the experience. However, how do we say that biological <br>
is not also this called "spiritual" ? What is, is what is.<br>
<p>
I believe that these particles of light are directly associated with <br>
neurotransmitters and that the white light is a neurotransmitter overload,<br>
or 100% maximum neurotransmitter cascade. I also suspect that the white<br>
light may happen when/if the synaptic gap is closed. <br>
<p>
I share my observations because I think they might contain important <br>
facts about the brain, the white light experience, consciousness,<br>
and reality. <br>

IAN: The fact that the white light experience is derived from the brain <br>
does not mean knowledge derived from the experience is false. In fact, <br>
assuming such would mean that all knowledge, being a derivative of <br>
neurological activity, is false. Furthermore, it is possible that <br>
in a neurotransmitter cascade, IQ reachs its maximum.<br>
<p>
How can we know if the "wisdom of the light" is true? Simple: if it <br>
is consistent with physical evidence and logical inference. <br>
<p>
Physical phenomena and logic dictate that the knowledge gained during <br>
the white light experience -- that all things are unitary -- is valid.<br>
<p>
How so ?<br>
<p>
Every identity and every attribute of every identity is relative and<br>
complimentary. Thing A implies not-A, as not-A implies A. There could <br>
be no A free from not-A. A and not-A are conceptually and physically<br>
interdependent.<br>
<p>
	IF: X is a part of A, if X is necessary for the existence of A,<br>
	THEN not-A, being necessary for A, is a part of A.<br>
<p>
	IF not-A is a part of A,<br>
	IF A is a part of not-A,<br>
	THEN both A and not-A have the same parts.<br>
<p>
	IF x has the same parts as y,<br>
	THEN x = y<br>
	ERGO A = not-A.<br>
<p>
That is the "wisdom of the light." All things are unified absolutely.<br>
<p>
Also: the external space around a particle is a necessary feature of the<br>
identity / existence of that particle. Thus the space around a particle<br>
is a part of the particle. As this is true for every particle, it follows<br>
that every particle contains every other particle across all space-time.<br>
<p>
Unless one can describe or show an example of a nonrelationally dependent <br>
thing / concept / identity, there is no basis in logic or fact to suggest <br>
that the knowledge gained in the white light experience is false. The <br>
"wisdom of the light" passes the most rigid standard of scientific <br>
verification -- total consistency with physical fact and logical<br>
inference. <br>
