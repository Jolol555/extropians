<p>
It's hard to believe that ET is altering every photon of light that reaches <br>
the earth, despite the nonsense about "the prime directive" on Star Trek I  <br>
don't see why they would go to the bother to make such a massive lie. <br>

<i>                &gt;or the assumption that large scale space travel is also                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;practically impossible (which looks like a slightly stronger                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;assumption than that large-scale engineering can't be done).</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
The only way life could fail to eventually to make a substantial impact on <br>
the cosmos is if nanotechnology is impossible, and that hardly seems likely, <br>
life itself is a primitive form of Nanotechnology.     <br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;The early steps in evolution leave room for hope. But the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;evolution of  tool-using intelligence happened so quickly                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;that the speed argument applies and indicates that that step   </i><br>
<i>                &gt;is not very hard.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
But tool-using intelligence didn't happen quickly, it took at least  <br>
3.5 billion years. What history teaches us is that even if an animal has <br>
only a modest sized brain, if it has a good  organ for manipulating matter <br>
with precision, a hand in our case, then it will evolve a much larger brain <br>
very quickly, and will instantaneously (from a geological perspective) reach <br>
the point we are at today.          <br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;One must be careful, though, not too neglect the possibility                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;that new technologies might make a social structure                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;incomparably more stable than any we have seen in history  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Technology generally makes things happen faster not slower, and the wider <br>
distribution of information, technology has certainly done that, does not <br>
bode well for the feasibility of stagnation.<br>
