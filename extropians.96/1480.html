<i>&gt;&gt;Much is being said, yet of little value. Sex appeared very early on the </i><br>
evolutionary theatre. Even the most primitive organisms have sex. <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I would think the place  * of value* to study is not how like animals our<br>
sexual behaviour is, but how it departs and why. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I  wouldn't count sex to traits that make us human, rather vice versa.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 If one had a belief like that, I would explore why one has these beliefs<br>
*just* to make sure one wasn't infected with early Christian/religious memes<br>
that hint as sex being"base" or "animal", with nonsexuality being "elevated "<br>
or supreme".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
That sex seems to mean so very much for us, is an artefact of evolution. <br>
Should replication, as it is to be expected, to become detached from  coitus,<br>
the act itself is going to become an atavism. <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, Eugene, of course in a limited selection perspective what you are saying<br>
is true, however, by your logic in most people's lives ( expecpt for maybe<br>
Catholics) ...it already is.... <br>
;  )<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
A lovable atavism maybe, yet an atavism nontheless.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
And what makes it so lovebable...... on parallel communication and  the<br>
subject of love....sigh....<br>
