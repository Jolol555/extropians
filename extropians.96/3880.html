In these criticisms of belief in "the Singularity," I can't help be curious<br>
*which* idea of singularity is being criticized.  Anders, Max and Shaun,<br>
for instance, seem to be talking about some wildly optimistic, "let's<br>
sit back and wait for Santa" version.  Well, singularity isn't singular.<br>
Just which ideas under this umbrella do you all have problems with?<br>
<p>
I certainly have problems with a large fraction, but I try to infer<br>
which singularity someone is writing about and criticize particular<br>
ideas.<br>
<p>
Since my idea of Singularity is one of alarm, of "agonizing reappraisal,"<br>
as they said in The Shockwave Rider, I wonder whether, when people say<br>
the Singularity won't happen, they mean I should relax.<br>
