 <br>
Thanks for your praise John!  To everyone else, I apologize that I<br>
posted the URL a week ago to Extropians, and yet have continuously and<br>
dramatically changed it since then.  So if ten of you read it, you<br>
each probably read a substantially different version.  I guess I'll<br>
learn to hold stuff back longer before I announce it.<br>

<i>&gt;4. Multi-cell life </i><br>
<i>&gt;5. Animals with big brains </i><br>
<i>&gt;6. Where we are now  </i><br>
<i>&gt;7. Explosion </i><br>
<i>&gt;... </i><br>
<i>&gt;in spite of this I have a hunch the bottleneck is in the first 6 stages, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;sure hope so. I want to talk a little about stages 5 and 6. Arthur C Clarke </i><br>
<i>&gt;wrote a short story about a  race of noble horse like beings who had </i><br>
<i>&gt;developed a complex and beautiful philosophy, possessed profound mathematical </i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas, and were more intelligent than humans,  but they had no technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;because the had no hands. Dolphins and whales in our world have very large </i><br>
<i>&gt;brains, but not only are they lacking hands they have other handicaps they </i><br>
<i>&gt;must overcome. If you live underwater you can't know anything about fire, an </i><br>
<i>&gt;essential ingredient in technology.  Also, It's hard enough to deduce the </i><br>
<i>&gt;basic laws of Physics living in an atmosphere, most of the laws are only</i><br>
<i>&gt;really obvious in a vacuum,  surely a bizarre concept for any life form </i><br>
<i>&gt;living in a thick heavy medium like water. </i><br>
<p>
As I mentioned in the paper, a big problem with this theory is the<br>
cosmologically short time it took our ancestors to go through these<br>
stages.  If this step was so astronomically improbable, why did it<br>
happen so quickly after the previous step?  Can land-dwelling<br>
creatures really be that improbable (given multi-cell life)?<br>
