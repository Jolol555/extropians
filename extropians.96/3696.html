Hal is quite right, if everyone followed my advice to bet that the dice would <br>
not come up double sixes, 90% of the people following my advice would lose the <br>
bet.  But when you are one of the people in the room at the time of a dice <br>
roll, you and all the other people in the room have exactly 1/36 of a chance <br>
that the dice will come up double sixes.  This probability will not change no <br>
matter how many people will come in the room during later attempts; the dice <br>
are not aware of how many people there are in the room and they will not roll <br>
in your favor; they will roll just like they always do -- randomly.<br>
<p>
When you are in the room with all the other people, you don't know if you are <br>
among the 10% who won't see double sixes or among the 90% who will.  You have <br>
a 1/36 chance of being among the 90% of people who see the double sixes and a <br>
35/36 chance of being among the 10%.  This is because each time the dice don't <br>
come up double sixes, ten times as many people are brought in to watch the <br>
dice be rolled again.  This next, larger group of people also have a 1/36 <br>
chance of seeing the dice come up double sixes and 35/36 chance that they <br>
won't.  And so on, until eventually one group of people will witness double <br>
sixes being rolled, and this group of people has approximately nine times as <br>
many people as all the other groups combined, who didn't see the dice come up <br>
double sixes.  But they only have nine times as many people because you keep <br>
multiplying the number of people in the room by ten after each non-double <br>
sixes.  You are *guaranteeing* that there will be approximately nine times as <br>
many people in the room when the event (which itself has only 1/36 chance of <br>
happening) of rolling double sixes happens, as you had in the room when it <br>
didn't happen.  The event itself still has the same probability, you are just <br>
making sure that when it *does* eventually happen, there will be many more <br>
people witnessing the event than those who did not witness it.  This <br>
contrivance has no sort of magical influence over the dice; they will roll <br>
just like always -- randomly.<br>
<p>
Consider the situation this way:  Most of the *groups* of people who are in <br>
the rooms for each roll of the dice will not see it come up double sixes.  <br>
Each group has a 1/36 chance that the dice will come up double sixes while <br>
that group is in the room.  As a member of a group in the room, you have a <br>
1/36 chance that your group will be the ones to witness the rolling of double <br>
sixes.  Again: Look at all the people in the room at any given dice roll as <br>
one group.  Each group has a 1/36 chance of the dice coming up double sixes, <br>
regardless of the size of the group.  As a member of any of the groups <br>
witnessing the dice roll, you have the same chances of being in the room when <br>
they come up double sixes as your whole group does, 1/36.<br>
<p>
This concludes Mr. Hal Finney's math lesson for today.  The homework for today <br>
is to slap your hand against your forehead three times and say "Doh!" each <br>
time.  To avoid further embarassment, Mr. Finney is advised to direct whatever <br>
questions he has regarding my explanation to me, privately.<br>
