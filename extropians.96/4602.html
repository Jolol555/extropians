Chris Hind quotes someone and adds his own comments:<br>
<p>
"&gt;The UN Space Treaty declared the Moon to belong to all nations equally.<br>
<i>&gt;The US refuses to sign this treaty for this reason (as we are the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones who actually got there).</i><br>
<p>
I agree with that. The others are just tag-along freeloaders! Yeah right,<br>
like they should have the honor of sharing our credit. We earned it while<br>
most countries sat on their asses."<br>
<p>
Chris, what do you mean, "*We* earned it."??!  You didn't do a damn thing to <br>
help anyone get on the moon;  You weren't even born yet.  I think we can <br>
safely put you in the tag-along freeloader category, for trying to take credit <br>
for what certain people did, who happened to live on the region of land you <br>
call your country.  What you just did in your comment is no different from the <br>
other countries taking credit for getting to the moon since people from their <br>
planet got there, even though they weren't personally involved.<br>
