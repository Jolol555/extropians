This is a problem, since so far we have not developed a good inter-person<br>
ethics able to handle extreme differences in mental architecture,<br>
intelligence or existential state. We will need something in this area <br>
rather soon.<br>

Maybe the same reason you don't nuke untrustworthy people - too <br>
expensive, too drastic, too large risks of retribution, vestigial <br>
emotional impulses of compassion. :-) <br>

Wouldn't it just be simpler to slow down your update rate? But I think a <br>
switch would be useful anyway. <br>
