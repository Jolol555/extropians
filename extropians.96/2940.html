<i>&gt;Yes there are members who have not been properly "taken care of". Many</i><br>
<i>&gt;women still do not feel like they are treated as part of the military,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or only view it as a way to get free education, or try to use the system</i><br>
<i>&gt;for personal aggrandizement. I've witnessed flase harassment cases</i><br>
<i>&gt;personally. Not against myself, but against others. I was the key</i><br>
<i>&gt;witness in a case in which two female airmen framed a male airman with</i><br>
<i>&gt;such claims. If I had not overheard them talking about it beforehand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;his life would be over.</i><br>
<p>
I saw this twice in my relatively short military career.  I too was witness<br>
in one incident that the charges were intentionally fabricated.  The problem<br>
with women in the military is that too many of them *don't want* to be<br>
treated on an equal basis with the men.  They want a civilian life plus a<br>
uniform.  The much lower standards for women in the military only aggravates<br>
and encourages this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not saying the truth may not come out. If some agency with</i><br>
<i>&gt;equivalent power shows an interest in invesigating this in earnest, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can guarrantee that any witnesses will come out of the woodwork. Until</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a time, the operating rule among lower ranking people is: COVER</i><br>
<i>&gt;YOUR ASS, SQUEAKY WHEELS GET TOSSED OVERBOARD, and WHISTLE BLOWERS GET</i><br>
<i>&gt;IT JAMMED DOWN THEIR THROATS. I've been there, done that, I know what I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am talking about. Anyone with a tale to tell needs a lot of cover</i><br>
<i>&gt;overhead to make it home.</i><br>
<p>
This is very true.  The military takes care of its own, and generally runs<br>
on its own set of rules.  Political or judicial action rarely has any impact<br>
on the fundamental SOPs and culture of military life.  You're either in all<br>
the way or you won't last.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aren't that competent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;US military personnel are not your regular government employees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; That's true, but we are talking about the military *plus* other government</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; agencies.  I am hardly convinced that Bill Clinton loves, respects, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would protect the U.S. military.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But he loves himself and his own power far more than the Constitution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;experienced. What is left?</i><br>
<p>
A missile would leave significant residue traces if it impacted on the<br>
plane.  If the missile was proximity fused, it would leave a very<br>
identifiable signature on parts of the plane due to the nature of proximity<br>
detonations.  Since it has not been mentioned anywhere, I will assume that a<br>
proximity detonating missile did not bring down the plane.  <br>
<p>
The Navy's Standard missile (presumably the one used this scenario) most<br>
likely uses a large composite warhead of RDX and TNT, both of which leave<br>
significant chemical traces, especially TNT.  However, no significant traces<br>
have been found of any explosive.<br>
<p>
Essentially all military explosives are detectable both by explosive<br>
detection hardware (like TNC) and residue traces.  Therefore, assuming that<br>
the facts available are correct and true, then military explosives are not<br>
involved.  This would significantly lessen the possibility that the military<br>
was directly involved.<br>
<p>
HYPOTHESIS:  There are much lesser known classes of explosives which 1) are<br>
not detectable via normal explosive detection hardware, and 2) do not leave<br>
chemical traces normally associated with explosives.  This would force the<br>
general requirement that the explosive was loaded on to the plane, not<br>
delivered by missile.  This would also generally show significant intent,<br>
since these explosives would require custom manufacture by a knowledgeable<br>
explosive chemist.  In turn, this would imply a bit more intelligence and<br>
resourcefulness than your average terrorist.  If you suspect the government,<br>
Sandia NL could easily produce the required compounds.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; So it comes down to what we know and don't know.  We know 100+ people</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; believe they saw a missile.  We know eyewitnesses at night can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; unreliable.  However, even if we decide they really did see a missile --</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which I do not consider unreasonable -- I have heard no "facts" that prove</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it was fired by a US Navy ship.</i><br>
<p>
We must also consider the fact that more people might have thought they saw<br>
a missile after it was suggested that it might have been a missile.<br>
Suggestion can adversely influence what people believe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Captains log has not been released to the public, and has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;classfied. Until it is released, a suspect is still out there.</i><br>
<p>
Which captain's log?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; You can't argue *both* that the US Navy can keep anything quiet they want</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; *and* that you or others know it was the Navy -- unless there is objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; proof like photographs of the ship firing the missile, US Navy missile</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; debris washed ashore, or whatever.  Otherwise, how did you find out what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they are so good at concealing?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Witnesses and the public statement of a DEMOCRAT who has long experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;in White House and other high level government business. 157 eye</i><br>
<i>&gt;witnesses corroborating each other is a much bigger statistical lump to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dismiss than just a few confused reports. If facts are not true, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically are widely varied in being described by witnesses. When they</i><br>
<i>&gt;all agree, that typically means that is accceptable as a fact.</i><br>
<p>
Ummm..., yes and no.  It means that they all *perceived* roughly the same<br>
thing.  Don't want to split hairs, but there is a difference.  Witnesses are<br>
a poor substitute for physical evidence.<br>
