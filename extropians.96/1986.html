	What I meant to suggest with the 'Anvil of Stars' reference and<br>
comments on 'What's natural life?' is that having superhuman<br>
intelligences engaging in contests with active deception, means that<br>
there's nothing much from a merely human, still 20th century, point of<br>
view that could possibly falsify the core theory. Ditto for God TOE.<br>
What could possibly be acccepted as conclusive evidence against it?<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I have no bone to pick on that score.<br>
<p>
But people bat Willam of Ockham's rule of thumb for *THEOLOGICAL* <br>
arguments (check the source or a decent historical survey some time; <br>
the guy was a churchmouse as most academics had to be at the time)<br>
as if it were some sort of law of nature.<br>
<p>
It's not.  It's just a heuristic.  And, as with many heuristics, it <br>
has domains of applicability and domains of inapplicability.<br>
And when it doesn't work, if you're staring at the ruler instead of<br>
the thin being measured, you should be prepared for disappointment.<br>
<p>
I like falsifiability just fine. It is a concept that is 'way 'way <br>
newer than Occam's Razor.<br>
