I was considering this thought. The best way to be uploaded is to<br>
genetically engineer an organism that would grow into your brain and destroy<br>
a neuron and map the equivelant connections in a virtual world. This<br>
organism would serve as an interface between brain and machine. After<br>
destroying the neuron, the organism would fill the gap with itself and have<br>
all connections from other neurons be redirected through the interface to<br>
the virtual brain map inside a virtual world inside a computer. Long term<br>
memory would be deleted and recreated and redirected to the computer first<br>
which would make things slightly longer to retrieve while the organism<br>
slowly grew into and took over your brain. This would enable you to grow<br>
into the virtual world to where you could switch between both and then<br>
eventually disconnect all biological senses entirely and live inside this<br>
virtual world. Is this better than cloning yourself inside a machine and<br>
destroying the original biological copy and thus kill off 'you' your<br>
self-aware being for some clone knowing everything you know living inside a<br>
virtual world? Also how difficult would it be to engineer this organism?<br>
