David responded:<br>
"A deterministic computer can also have memory [snip] and it can plan<br>
ahead by anticipating the probability of future events based on whatever<br>
type of algorithims it has been programmed with or has evolved. Having<br>
these abilities doesn't somehow, magically transform the deterministic <br>
computer into a non-deterministic computer.  And us having these<br>
abilities doesn't magically transform us into non-Markov chains.  They<br>
are poorly understood processes, but that is no reason to invoke<br>
miracles to explain them.  I see no reason to invoke any sort of "life<br>
force" or "soul" to explain ourselves; these are simply ways of avoiding<br>
further analysis."<br>
<p>
Mark:<br>
JUST FOR THE RECORD, I IN NO WAY SPOKE OF MAGIC, LIFE-FORCE OR SOUL AND<br>
DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH!<br>
<p>
That said, I don't completely dismiss the possibility that there might<br>
be some rational semantic equivalent to some of the concepts normally<br>
associated with the terms 'life-force' and 'soul' (I'm thinking in<br>
particular of David Krieger's discussion with David Ross in the 1994 3rd<br>
quarter Extropy, "Souls, Cyberspace, Sins &amp; Singularities").  Still, I<br>
completely agree with David Musick that "our minds and everything about<br>
us are part of the natural world, the physical world.  There is no need<br>
to propose any sort of super-natural realm to explain anything."<br>
<p>
Perhaps my statement, "Maxwell's immortal demon, at last perhaps?" was<br>
misinterpreted as implying a belief in magic or perpetual motion.  It<br>
was supposed to be humorous.  I was trying to make the case that there<br>
might be EXTROPIC forces that complement or sometimes counteract<br>
ENTROPIC forces.<br>
<p>
In fact, check out the 9/21/96 Science News where there is an article<br>
describing how experiments with polystyrene spheres in water show that<br>
entropy of particles at one scale can actually induce organization of<br>
particles at another, larger scale.<br>
<p>
My problem with Markov chains as a model for real-world processes (aside<br>
from my naive undertanding of the mathematics involved, which was<br>
clearly stated in my original post) is that (I think, correct me if I'm<br>
wrong) they can only model discrete objects and don't allow for the<br>
possibility of interaction with other objects at the time of state<br>
transition.  While John K. Clark has nicely explained how random inputs<br>
can be incorporated into the state-transition probabilities using<br>
various stochastic distributions, I'm still not clear on whether these<br>
can account for the types of intentional changes that humans, among<br>
other living organisms can produce.<br>
