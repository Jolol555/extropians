I'm not saying Nanotechnology will only use one stage in manufacturing, just<br>
that the number of stages should not be so large as to lead to a bewildering<br>
number part types, because then the advantage you gain from specialized<br>
manufacturing techniques would be lost in the difficulties of organizing<br>
everything.         <br>

<p>
<p>
I don't see any reason to think that is true. There are no preferred time<br>
frames, things happen at all levels from Pico seconds to billions of years,<br>
and lots of things happen faster than organic reactions.<br>
                   <br>

<i>                &gt;a century ago in CHANCE AND NECESSITY.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
It's been a few years since I read Monad's book, but I think I know what<br>
you're driving at, and there is more than a little truth to it. If I gave a<br>
Martian nothing but the sequence of the amino acids in a protein, there is no<br>
way he could figure out what it's shape would be, he would need more<br>
information, like the fact that the protein will be in water, and at a narrow<br>
range of temperature, and at a specific acidity. All these things effect the<br>
way a protein folds up. Actually, if I just gave the Martian some DNA he<br>
couldn't even figure out the amino acid sequence of the protein the DNA<br>
symbolized, much less know what its shape would be, because he would need to<br>
know what The Genetic code would be, and that resides everywhere and nowhere.<br>
<p>
The genetic code that all life on earth uses is arbitrary. For example, <br>
the nucleotide triplet CAU in messenger RNA symbolizes the amino acid <br>
histidine but their are no special chemical  characteristics that relate one <br>
to the other. One type of transfer RNA has an anticodon that connects to the <br>
CAU triplet of messenger RNA like a key fitting into a lock. At another part <br>
of the transfer RNA molecule, an amino acid can be attached, in this case <br>
histidine. However transfer RNA can't tell one amino acid from another, <br>
the amino acid attachment part is IDENTICAL in all tRNA molecules, but in <br>
practice, only those that have the anticodon for CAU are attached to <br>
histidine. The reason for this is an enzyme ( aminocyl-tRNA synthetase). <br>
<p>
This enzyme can tell one amino acid from another, and it can tell one tRNA  <br>
molecule from another, and it can a attach a animo acid to it. However, this  <br>
enzyme does NOT look at the anticodon at all but at another part of the  <br>
transfer RNA, the DHU loop. In the lab the DHU loop from one type of tRNA has <br>
been grafted onto another type of tRNA and that changes the genetic code.  <br>
It's also interesting that this enzyme is a protein encoded by, what else,  <br>
the genetic code. I can't point to exactly where the genetic code is, because  <br>
it does not reside in any one of these stages, it resides in all of them.<br>
<p>
Having said this however I don't think the situation would be different for<br>
Nanotechnology. If I gave our Martian friend the digital instructions sent<br>
to a assembler he could not figure out what if anything it would make,<br>
unless he knew something about the nano computer's design and what sort of<br>
manipulator arm it had. He would also need to know some of the details the<br>
machine would be working in, like the fact that atoms are so numerous and<br>
move so fast that if you need a hydrogen atom you don't need to go searching<br>
for one, just sit tight and one will come to you. I think the Nanotech<br>
environment will be far more information rich than anything life knows about.<br>

                    <br>
<p>
Yes, it has its uses, and until stone tools came on the scene it was the only<br>
way complex objects could get made.<br>
                                                                              <br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;contain a HUGE amount of redundancy. [Just use] the </i><br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;compression in ZIP and GIF files.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Easily said. But does this work with something of the order </i><br>
<i>                &gt;of 10^30 atoms, *each scanned individually*?  </i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
The algorithms should work, the problem is the hardware, no computer today <br>
could come close to handling a file of that size.<br>
