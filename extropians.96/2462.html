The "We are All Self-Employed" meme was brought up here, and 'banjo' wrote:<br>
<p>
"The implied ideology behind a "WE ARE ALL SELF-EMPLOYED" meme, is that the <br>
natural metaphor for human relationships is commerce.<br>
<p>
Im not that alienated from the human race."<br>
<p>
I see in this response the idea that commerce and economics are something cold <br>
and impersonal and that to be engaged in these activities is equivalent to <br>
alienating oneself from others.  This is a common view of economics.  But it <br>
is a very superficial view.  All forms of economics and commerce are, at <br>
heart, agreements between people.  Generally, "commerce" and "economics" <br>
refers to agreements to trade things or services.  Economics and commerce are <br>
one form of agreements which people make with each other.  I don't see how <br>
agreeing with other people alienates one from those people.  Agreeing and <br>
having common goals generally pulls people together into closer and more <br>
intimate relationships, in my experience.<br>
<p>
I make a different interpretation of the meme, "We are all self-employed".  To <br>
me, that phrase is equivalent to, "We are all responsible for our own lives".  <br>
That is the implied ideology I see in the "Self-Employed" meme.  We all have <br>
certain resources available to us, including time, materials, talents, skills, <br>
knowledge, etc.  In running the business of our lives, we must choose how we <br>
will use our resources to achieve the desired effects in our lives.  If our <br>
desire is to spend a lot of time with particular people whom we love very <br>
much, then we must organize our lives in such a way that we can accomplish <br>
that goal.  And doing this is our own business, our own form of organization.<br>
<p>
"Business" in the general sense is simply a way of organizing resources to <br>
accomplish certain objectives.  Business can be a cold, impersonal thing, or <br>
it can be a warm, loving, dynamic relationship between people.  It all depends <br>
on how it's organized.<br>
<p>
Being self-employed doesn't mean that you can't work together with others.  <br>
The most successful people are generally the ones who are good at working with <br>
others cooperatively, to the mutual benefit of everyone involved.  I don't see <br>
how this alienates people.<br>
<p>
Taking responsibility for my own life by being self-employed encourages me to <br>
develop the resources necessary to achieve my goals, including the goals of <br>
developing deep and meaningful relationships with other people.  Being <br>
self-employed in no way causes me to be alienated from the human race.<br>
