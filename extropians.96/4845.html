Is it *obvious* to any intelligent person that specific known radical<br>
changes would make most everyone better off?  To the contrary, I think<br>
holding this opinion is a clear sign of over confidence.  I'd probably<br>
favor political experimentation in the same direction you would, but I<br>
have no illusions that we're sure of the consequences.  Political<br>
systems are *complicated*, damn it!  There is much we do not know.<br>
