<i>&gt;What really gets my goat is the total lack (as far as I could see),</i><br>
<i>&gt;of acknowledgement to Nikolai Tesla, who conceived much of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;idea. He was dismissed as a crackpot, then and now.</i><br>
<p>
It's Nikola, not Nikolai, he was a Serbian from Lika (the name Nikolai<br>
is seldom met in the Balkans), and he hasn't been dismissed as a<br>
crackpot any more than your average neighbourhood genius.  In fact,<br>
if there is any single person "responsible" for the existence of<br>
computers through butterfly effect, it would be him: his work on<br>
three-phase alternating current distribution made mass distribution of<br>
electricity to homes feasible at the time.  Unlike T.A. Edison's light<br>
bulb, a relatively miniscule fraction of the population knows anything<br>
about it, yet its economical and social impact was several orders of<br>
magnitude larger.  <br>
<p>
The "crackpot" part usually creeps into popular biographies, fueled<br>
mostly by Tesla's pitiable social skills.  A common compassion-inducer<br>
in texts about him is that he "died alone in a hotel room."  Millions<br>
of people do every year.  Not many can claim a hundredth of Tesla's<br>
contribution to human knowledge.  The unit strength of magnetic field<br>
in the SI system of units is called Tesla in his honor.<br>
He had a truly outstanding mind.  He was also sending signals to<br>
Martians. (Maybe he found out from a meteorite that landed in his back<br>
yard? ;)<br>
