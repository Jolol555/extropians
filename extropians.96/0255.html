Although I don't know of of any scientific studies on birth memories and near <br>
death experiences such as Max requested, I do have some personal experience with <br>
this.<br>
<p>
As a child in the 1950's, I was given ether as an anesthetic twice.  Once for a <br>
tonsillectomy and once for a minor ear surgery.  Each time as the anesthetic was <br>
started, I had the experience of being propelled down a tunnel.  <br>
<p>
For the next few years, I was puzzled by this bizarre experience but never <br>
attached any explanation to it (although I was raised in a rather traditional <br>
midwestern religious family).  After thinking about the experience several years <br>
later, I realized this was a birth memory and became curious why it was <br>
triggered under those conditions.<br>
<p>
Thinking it might be the ether, I asked my mother if she was given ether when I <br>
was born.  She told me that the nurse-anesthesiologist showed up late in the <br>
delivery room and she wasn't given any anesthetic or pain-killer at all. (I <br>
suspect that babies born to mothers who are sufficiently drugged would not have <br>
a birth memory.)<br>
<p>
I suspect that what triggered the memory was the combination of the operating <br>
room environment and the feeling of being suffocated.  Both ether and the first <br>
movements down the birth canal result in intense feelings of suffocation that <br>
induce strong feelings of panic.<br>
<p>
Descriptions of near death experiences that I have heard all are almost <br>
identical to my birth memory in every respect except their interpretation.  <br>
Those I have encountered who interpret the experience as something <br>
other-worldly, emphatically reject the idea of a birth memory.  Most people who <br>
interpreted the experience as a conventional Near Death Experience have a <br>
wistful longing for their own deaths.  On the other hand, by the time I was <br>
twenty, I had rejected my religious upbringing and become passionately <br>
interested in life extension.<br>
