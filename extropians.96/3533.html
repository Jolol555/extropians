<i>&gt;&gt; correctly, "Lorentz-invariant zero point fields") is a very real phenomenon</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and has significant implications both in propulsion and physics in general.</i><br>
<i>&gt;snip snip.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I mean, who *wouldn't* be interested in the ability to arbitrarily modify</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; inertial mass and gravitation?  The applications would be endless.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would definitely. The problem with energy that is at such an entropy</i><br>
<i>&gt;state is that its at the bottom of the potential barrel. Sure theres a</i><br>
<i>&gt;LOT of it down there, but its still down there rather than up here.</i><br>
<p>
The ZPF is not an energy source.  What ZPF does (in the propulsion sense) is<br>
that it generates resistance to acceleration.  Every time an object<br>
accelerates, it causes a distortion in the ZPF.  This distortion generates a<br>
counterforce opposite of and proportional to the force applied to the object<br>
to make it accelerate.  If there was a way to eliminate or attenuate this<br>
distortion, you could modify and possibly eliminate the inertial mass of an<br>
object.  Consider the possibilities:  You could travel a very long distance<br>
on almost no fuel, and you could take a 90 degree corner at 10,000 miles per<br>
hour and experience no significant gee forces.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, as you said, the biggest brains have no idea right now of how</i><br>
<i>&gt;to use it, while crackpots run around claiming breakthroughs galore that</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can never prove. The effect I am using in my device has been</i><br>
<p>
The mathematical complexity of the theory involved would generally discount<br>
most crackpots based on their education alone.  And the physicists involved<br>
have been making slow, but productive progress.  Like most scientific<br>
discoveries, it takes a lot of slow grinding away in the lab to get to the<br>
end point.  And assuming that your propulsion device works, there would<br>
still be limits on the acceleration due to the problem of inertia (and our<br>
capacities to handle inertia) when applied to space travel.  A ZPF solution<br>
would eliminate inertia as problem entirely (as well as providing a very<br>
efficient propulsion system with no moving parts).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;demonstrated to work by others. I also have an expanded description on</i><br>
<i>&gt;my <a href="http://www.tpk.net/~retroman/Lorreydr.htm">http://www.tpk.net/~retroman/Lorreydr.htm</a> of a vector analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt;showing how it achieves its performance. It is rather simplified for</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone to understand. WHat did you think of the multiphasic x-axis</i><br>
<i>&gt;output chart I put up here?</i><br>
<p>
I checked out the site, and the chart, but this leads me to a couple<br>
questions.  First of all, what is the spike in the output?  Just curious.<br>
Also, the output shouldn't be a simple sine wave based on the description of<br>
the operation.  It would look more like a sine wave with a Doppler shift,<br>
although the net results in a multiphase system may be the same.  Also,<br>
although it is possible to bleed and store energy from a system and return<br>
it to the system at any point without any type of mechanical linkage (for<br>
example via some type of electromagnetic induction/propulsion system), the<br>
net force on the entire system (including the non-mechanically linked<br>
electromagnetic devices and all involved components) is still zero, although<br>
it appears that mechanically-linked components have had energy bled or<br>
added.  No matter which way you slice it, Newtonian physics does require an<br>
equal and *opposite* reaction *anytime* there is an acceleration of any<br>
type.  Your design, from what I can see and extrapolate, appears to obey<br>
conservation of energy however.  The speed up and slow down on opposite<br>
sides of the cylinder would force some object, mechanically linked or<br>
otherwise, to have a net force in a direction opposite the cylinder apparatus.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, there is a type of pump which operates on a principle very<br>
similar  to your drive.  I don't remember the name, but as an engineer you<br>
might be familiar with it...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you can show my stuff to some people at Lockeed that are willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;check it out, I would really appreciate it....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I would, but I don't work there anymore.<br>
