I read a story once (again, can't recall exactly where/who), in which a<br>
particular experiment, if run successfully would have destroyed the<br>
universe. The only realized this after many trials -- power failures etc.<br>
kept getting in the way. They realized that they had to be in one of those<br>
universes in which life continued to exist.<br>
<p>
A less science-fiction version of this is the "Mediocre Universe", i.e., why<br>
we happen to live in the unlikely that we do (aka the Anthropic Principle).<br>
See <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/~sean/BT/9.html#mediocre">http://www.lucifer.com/~sean/BT/9.html#mediocre</a><br>

               "Some universes may spawn far more civilizations than<br>
               others -- one universe might be harsh and allow life merely<br>
               to squeak by, while another, more fecund universe might<br>
               be teeming with millions of inhabited solar systems. <br>
<p>
               "If so, Vilenkin reasoned, a small percentage of universes<br>
               would account for the lion's share of civilizations. Any<br>
               randomly chosen civilization -- say, for example, ours --<br>
               would be far more likely to come from one of these<br>
               high-civilization-producing universes than from a stingy<br>
               universe harboring only one or two civilizations. After all,<br>
               if you randomly picked a person from among the billions<br>
               of people on Earth, he or she would more likely hail from<br>
               populous China or India than from tiny Liechtenstein or<br>
               Luxembourg. This reasoning applies as well to civilizations<br>
               and universes.<br>
