<i>&gt;technical papers and looks for associations that would not normally have</i><br>

<i>&gt;slips down into slight unconsciousness, rides the border, releasing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;torrent of new and creative unforeseen ideas. </i><br>
<p>
Many of my best ideas have also when I was either tired, or "under the<br>
influence".  My "normal" sober self tends to be extremely rational and<br>
analytical, which while very helpful for much of the work I do, isn't<br>
particularly conducive to creativity.  I have been successfully working on<br>
achieving this creative state via consciously "switching" between modes.<br>
<p>
Minor Digression:<br>
<p>
What I find interesting, is that I have found out (over the last year or so)<br>
that I can exert a phenomenal amount of control over my body and mind by<br>
force of will alone.  I have been experimenting extensively with trying to<br>
control various parts of my biological functioning via conscious thought.<br>
It is easiest with realtime biofeedback, and my first experimental target<br>
was my heart rate.  Currently I can drop my heart rate by about 20 pulses<br>
per minute and raise it about 40 pulses per minute almost immediately simply<br>
by "making it so".  When I first tried doing this, I had a difficult time<br>
making my heart rate change at all, but with practice, I found that I could<br>
do it both quickly and fairly dramatically.  I have tried this with a lot of<br>
other biological functions such as body temperature, metabolism, and many<br>
other metrics and have had significant success.  Ideally, I would like to be<br>
able to control, absolutely, every significant functioning of my body via<br>
conscious thought. <br>
<p>
The key to doing this, for me, was the subtle differences between "hoping<br>
something will happen", "seeing if something will happen", and "making<br>
something happen".  The key is to simply "make it happen" under the<br>
assumption that you can already do it.  Its as if your body won't let your<br>
mind take control unless your mind actually knows that it can.  Its not as<br>
if you should be "requesting" these things, because you already own them but<br>
just aren't aware of it.  And with regular practice, it becomes easier to do.  <br>
<p>
I was prompted to look into this by something that I have been able to do<br>
for years, and that is operate without an alarm clock.  Before I go to<br>
sleep, I tell myself what time I want to wake up.  Almost without fail (it<br>
doesn't always work if I am really exhausted), I wake up within two minutes<br>
of the time I wanted to wake up.  When I first found out that I could do<br>
this I thought it was odd, but now I simply accept it as a normal aspect of<br>
my existence.  The most interesting part of this to me is:  How does the<br>
mind keep such an accurate sense of time while you are sleeping, when there<br>
is no external queues?<br>
<p>
My ultimate goal in all this is that I hope to eventual have the capability<br>
to consciously reprogram my own mind in an active, effective fashion.<br>
Historically, people have been aware that it is possible to have a great<br>
deal of control over mind and body simply by the mechanism of suggestion.  I<br>
am seeking a way of actively harnessing this elusive interface to my own<br>
advantage.  <br>
<p>
Who knows, maybe I will write about it someday.<br>
