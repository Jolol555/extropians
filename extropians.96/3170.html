I'm not sure that this is very significant - a New York Times article<br>
which mentions the Singularity, only to go off on a tangent about digital<br>
alienation - and maybe I ought to be passing on some real news, like<br>
the Yahoo/Reuters article "Aspirin Protects Brain Cells"<br>
(<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/961121/health/stories/aspirin_1.html;">http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/961121/health/stories/aspirin_1.html;</a><br>
their Health Headlines section carries something of interest most days),<br>
or just about anything from the AIP Physics News Update <br>
(<a href="http://newton.ex.ac.uk/aip/">http://newton.ex.ac.uk/aip/</a>).<br>
<p>
This came via the novelty@levity.com mailing list.<br>

<i>&gt;Subject: Verner Vinge's Singularity</i><br>
<p>
This article on Verner Vinge's ideas about singularity was published on the<br>
New York Times' web site today:<br>
<p>
November 20, 1996<br>
<p>
By ASHLEY DUNN<br>
<p>
In Vinge's 'Singularity,' An Oracle of Digital Doom<br>
<p>
In mathematics, singularity is a term used to describe a unique point of<br>
radical transition. It is typically explained with the simple function,<br>
y=1/x. As x grows smaller, y increases until at the point x=0, the function<br>
goes to infinity and ceases to have meaning.<br>
<p>
It was on this theme that Vernor Vinge, professor of mathematics at San<br>
Diego State University and Hugo Award-winning author of A Fire Upon the<br>
Deep, presented a paper in March 1993 on what he argued was an impending<br>
point of radical transition.<br>
<p>
At the VISION-21 Symposium, sponsored by the NASA Lewis Research Center and<br>
the Ohio Aerospace institute, Vinge proposed that humanity was approaching<br>
a technological singularity beyond which all previous human history would<br>
have no meaning.<br>
<p>
It was a point of transition that would be as shattering as the emergence<br>
of human consciousness -- the phenomena that separated mankind from animals<br>
so many millenia ago.<br>
<p>
The spark of the singularity was the increasing capabilities of computers,<br>
which, he argued, could soon eclipse the abilities of humans. Vinge<br>
proposed that if computers could achieve a level of intelligence equal to<br>
humans, it was certain they would also achieve level of super-intelligence<br>
and consciousness, possibly in a matter of hours. At that moment of<br>
awakening, human history would end. The entities of singularity would be to<br>
us, as we are to insects. He predicted that humanity would reach the<br>
singularity sometime between 2005 and 2030.<br>
<p>
Vinge's vision of doom is, of course, only one of countless visions that<br>
have appeared through the millennia -- the deluge, the purifying fire, the<br>
simple sputtering of the universe at some blank end point of space and<br>
time. Even within our lifetimes, there have been several compelling visions<br>
of the end that have gradually become embedded in our existence, most<br>
notably nuclear holocaust and ecological disaster.<br>
<p>
I leave the truth of these visions for others to debate. In many ways, when<br>
and how we will be extinguished is not the point. What is important about<br>
them is that they reflect the fears of their times. They are encoded<br>
markers of transition, movement and imbalance.<br>
<p>
The most obvious fear reflected in Vinge's singularity is over the<br>
acceleration of technological development. Even now in the pre-singularity<br>
era, whole industries have been wiped out by automation. Jobs that once<br>
took skill now require only endurance and drugs.<br>
<p>
But while the fear is justified, there is something else in Vinge's vision<br>
of the singularity that has made it a manifesto of future despair and, for<br>
some, transcendent salvation.<br>
<p>
To control the moment of the singularity, Vinge proposed the development of<br>
a field he called Intelligence Amplification - that is, the bonding of<br>
humans, devices and networks into an organic whole. The basic idea is: If<br>
you can't beat them, join them -- literally.<br>
<p>
Whether that can actually be accomplished is not the issue. There is<br>
something in this science fiction vision of the future that makes it<br>
resonate now.<br>
<p>
A group of futurists have embraced the idea of Intelligence Amplification<br>
because of its promise of greatly enhancing human abilities, which are weak<br>
in exactly the characteristics in which computers excel -- precision,<br>
persistence and speed.<br>
<p>
But Vinge recognized that the possibilities with Intelligence Amplification<br>
were at least as grim as they were hopeful.<br>
<p>
"The problem is not simply that the Singularity represents the passing of<br>
humankind from center stage but that it contradicts our most deeply held<br>
notions of being," Vinge wrote in his paper.<br>
<p>
"What happens when pieces of ego can be copied and merged, when the size of<br>
a self awareness can grow or shrink to fit the nature of the problems under<br>
consideration?"<br>
<p>
It is this issue of ego that makes the Borg vision of doom such a resonant<br>
image in the present. It reflects an anxiety over the dismemberment of<br>
identity now, whether or not we actually get implanted brain chips in the<br>
future. The most unsettling option of the singularity is not the end of<br>
existence per se. After all, who cares, if we are all dead? Instead, it is<br>
the end of identity that is disturbing. As with most visions of doom, there<br>
must be consciousness for punishment to make sense.<br>
<p>
Unless you live in a closet, it is not hard to sense the fragmentation and<br>
dissolution of our times. It is a world where individual emotion has been<br>
mixed and diluted into an ambiguous stew with televised emotions.<br>
Experience is what you see on the tube. Identity is what some credit<br>
database says you are.<br>
<p>
Marshall McLuhan was one of the first to ponder dysfunction in the<br>
electronicized age. He believed that the core of modern despair lay with<br>
the distention of senses brought about by technological advances. The<br>
invention of writing was the original source of pain, separating humans<br>
from the close-knit oral culture and thrusting them into a more distant and<br>
cool world of visual culture. McLuhan believed that global media, like<br>
television and radio, had the ability to heal this separation by creating a<br>
new collective culture. separation by creating a new collective culture.<br>
<p>
McLuhan was writing in an era when computers were owned by only the Defense<br>
Department and large corporations. I doubt he would be so optimistic if he<br>
were alive today.<br>
<p>
The computer, especially as a node on the global network, has opened a new<br>
realm of possibilities by granting the power of broadcast and reception to<br>
the everyone -- companies, individuals and governments. This has led to an<br>
even greater degree of detachment and illusion as people have rushed to<br>
create their virtual identities.<br>
<p>
The Internet is awash in people posing as others because it is so easy to<br>
do. But I would argue that creating these illusions of identity is not a<br>
matter of choice but rather a requirement of the device.<br>
<p>
Life is analog, and thousands of years of human evolution have bred a set<br>
of senses attuned to a finely shaded world of eye contact, whispers,<br>
touches, body language and shared experience. The computer, however,<br>
accepts only a shadowy rendition because of its requirement for precision,<br>
abstraction, categorization and quantification. We obey.<br>
<p>
In some areas, abstracted identity is already more powerful than real<br>
identity -- for example, credit and justice. Legislation like three-strikes<br>
laws is just another way of saying that analog life is not that important.<br>
In a digital world, it is simply easier dealing with digital people.<br>
<p>
The result of all of this is not an extension of our senses, as McLuhan had<br>
proposed, but a numbing of them. The richness of sight has been reduced to<br>
tube dimensions; the cloud of experience and wisdom, boiled down to<br>
hypertext links and CD-ROM encyclopedias. We may able to view and access<br>
more, but that is not the same as seeing and knowing.<br>
<p>
What is most haunting about this construction of abstracted life is that<br>
there is no turning back. It is a point of such fundamental change -- like<br>
consciousness, sight or language -- that once you have passed it, you can<br>
never retrace your steps.<br>
<p>
It may be that we have already passed the singularity and don't realize it<br>
because everything around us has changed as well. It is not the same<br>
singularity that Vinge envisioned, but it is just as radical and disruptive.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we are flying now beyond infinity. There are no clear markers here.<br>
We are blind and ignorant as we search for a new function, a new meaning<br>
for y to describe our path.<br>
