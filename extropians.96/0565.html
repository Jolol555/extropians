Cyc is an AI project, started in 1984 by Doug Lenat, whose objective<br>
was to create a common-sense knowledge base - to avoid the brittleness<br>
of specialist expert systems which "know" all about a limited technical<br>
domain, but can't detect the contradiction in the statement that <br>
"I'm 18 years old, and have held my current job for 20 years".<br>
By 1995 there was a Cycorp, Inc., whose web is at <a href="http://www.cyc.com">http://www.cyc.com</a>,<br>
and the knowledge base contained hundreds of thousands of propositions,<br>
written in the CycL language.<br>
<p>
The core of Cyc's "ontology" (implicit theory of reality, I suppose)<br>
has been released on the web this month; you should be able to reach it at<br>
<a href="http://www.cyc.com/cyc-2-1/intro.html">http://www.cyc.com/cyc-2-1/intro.html</a>. There are also plans to release<br>
a Cyc inference engine and an HTML browser for the knowledge base (for<br>
Unix, anyway), and the specifications of CycL. I gather that the plan is<br>
to allow people to create specialized knowledge bases in their webs,<br>
which will then become accessible for people using the inference engine.<br>
Cycorp is apparently planning to keep most of its accumulated knowledge<br>
base proprietary; it will be interesting to see how quickly a free<br>
public-domain one develops on the web.<br>
