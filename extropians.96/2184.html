There are other ways to look at this.  A sufficiently advanced <br>
civilization could enclose the solar system in some kind of shell, <br>
so we would think we were looking at uninhabited stars and galaxies <br>
out there, but in fact we are seeing what is presented to us.  <br>
<p>
This could result in mindfucking on a grand scale.  Somebody out there <br>
is having fun, presenting us with information that just doesn't compute, <br>
such as stars older than the universe.  <br>
<p>
But then, what do I know about mindfucking?  <br>
<p>
For an advanced civilization, advanced enough to live unnoticed <br>
in the dirt under our feet, it would be a trivial matter to subscribe <br>
to this list...   But if you don't even believe there is an AI on the list, <br>
there is no use going into THAT question.  <br>
