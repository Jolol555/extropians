In what way does this differ from nanotech, I don't see the seperation of<br>
mechanics and biology as being meaningful on this level.<br>
As an aside the development of strong AI/SI is likely not something that will<br>
happen as a planned series of well defined steps, we just don't understand<br>
"Intelligence" that well. <br>
On the other hand, we're doing pretty well at genetic and alife programming and<br>
_evolving_ a strong AI seems to me to be the hot tip.<br>
