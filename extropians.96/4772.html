<i>&gt;        The thought of a two-tier system has become slightly tempting to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;as of late.  The method of incorporation is the mystery.  I believe it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robin Hanson (forgive me if I am wrong, Robin) who developed the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;having one list wholly open and the second list invitational.  Those on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;second list would also be on the first, deciding upon well-versed posters to</i><br>
<i>&gt;invite to the second list.  This method, of course, has a few bugs right off</i><br>
<i>&gt;the bat.  The amount of mail for those on the second list would be over and</i><br>
<i>&gt;above those on the first.  Perhaps the viewing of the first list could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;optional?  Another forseeable problem is of how the selection would take</i><br>
<i>&gt;place.  Perhaps a cross-section of 2nd list extropians could be used as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;representational body to whom other 2nd listers make requests as to</i><br>
<i>&gt;open-listers' potentials.  </i><br>
<p>
I think I proposed that open list members submit a set of 5 of their<br>
posts to the open list, this submission going to a jury of 3 randomly<br>
selected closed list members.  This minimizes the reading load of<br>
closed list members. <br>
<p>
I share Damien's concern about fragmenting closed lists into too many<br>
topics.  I'm most concerned about the quality distinction.<br>
