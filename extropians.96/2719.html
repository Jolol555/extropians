<i>&gt; &gt;"What about the whales? we can't understand them and they have such big</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;brains they MUST be intelligent." Wrong. Their minds are almost totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;occupied with  the vast signal processing required by their sonar</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;system. Did you know that they can create a sonic image of the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pacific ocean? That takes major processing. That does not leave much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;room for abstract thought. Plus if you look at their brian mass to body</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mass ratio, they would still be far below humans, as are all othr earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;animals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, there are a few cetaceans that have a higher brain mass to body</i><br>
<i>&gt; mass ratio that humans.  The dolphin is one of them.  The dolphin also has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; more convoluted brain than humans.  They exhibit complex intelligent speech</i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree about the signal processing issue, though.  Cetaceans have</i><br>
<i>&gt; excellent audio capabilities, but mediocre, non-stereoscopic vision and</i><br>
<i>&gt; vision processing.  Humans have mediocre audio capabilities, but very good</i><br>
<i>&gt; visual processing capabilities.  Humans receive something like 90% of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensory input through their eyes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I used to work on DSP applications, mostly audio, but occasionally graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt; oriented.  Visual processing applications almost always require an order of</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnitude more processing power than audio ones.  I have heard the argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; before, but I have a difficult time believing that cetaceans use more of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their brain for audio processing than we use for vision.  State-of-the-art</i><br>
<i>&gt; audio rendering software can run in realtime on a processor capable of less</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 200-mips.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, our hearing is more capable than most people think.  I have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiments where blind people were able to echo-locate objects with a cross</i><br>
<i>&gt; section of 1 square inch in a room using their own voice, and could detect</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes in position of 3" at a distance of 15' of objects with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cross-section of 1 square inch.  Non-blind people tend to only have a range</i><br>
<i>&gt; of 3-7', but everyone possesses the capability.  I actually took one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these tests.  My effective range was 5-6'.  Most people don't know they can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do it until they try.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -James Rogers</i><br>
<i>&gt;  jamesr@best.com</i><br>
Comparing a humans ability to echolocate an object in a room to a whale<br>
creating a topographical image of the entire pacific ocean with one honk<br>
is quite a bit of a stretch.<br>
<p>
I would like to find out where you get the information that dolphins had<br>
a greater brain/body mass ratio. What I had heard previously was they<br>
had about 80% of our capacity at best.<br>
<p>
ANyways, this is WAY off topic, as neither whales or dolphins have<br>
anything like technology, so my argument still stands: We will have no<br>
real big probelms communicating with an intelligent technological<br>
civilization due to mathematics and science commonality.<br>
<p>
Just the fact that dolphins and whales have such comparable brain/body<br>
mass ratios, yet have not developed technology as we have proves my<br>
other point, that the most likely body scheme for an intelligent<br>
technological alien would be bipedals, with hands, as technology is the<br>
result of an omnivorous creature with hands and no real defense<br>
capabilities other than its hands and brain. Cetaceans have no need for<br>
hands, and thus technology, so are stuck in an evolutionary trap<br>
preventing them from becoming a technological civilization, unless we<br>
"uplift" them a la David Brin.<br>
