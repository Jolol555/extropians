Thanks, Chris. I really had a big debate with myself if I was even going<br>
to put a page up explaining it, for exactly the reason that occured. I<br>
finally decided that the computer simulations were enough to be<br>
reasonably sure that it did _something_, and given the one big hitch<br>
these guys so quickly came up with (that I have known about for a while)<br>
has been taken care of (I turn it 90 degrees and use some<br>
counter-rotation) I feel reasonably secure that things shoud in the end<br>
turn out ok. Outisde of maybe one paragraph, I really tried to keep from<br>
reciprocating the flamethrowing, and I appreciate ELiezer's decision to<br>
chill out until I get a real model finished that either works or doen't<br>
<p>
 Lets just get<br>
<i>&gt; out there and do the damn stuff! Lets consider some of the things we can do</i><br>
<i>&gt; with just a first glance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; - Invest in extropian-related companies (nanotech, genetics)</i><br>
<i>&gt; - Attend extropian meetings</i><br>
<i>&gt; - How about we pick a night for an IRC meeting where we can discuss topics</i><br>
<i>&gt; in near-realtime?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any others? Forget your criticisms for a moment! Lets work towards a better</i><br>
<i>&gt; future!</i><br>
<p>
We should try to really promote meetings on college campuses. i don't<br>
know if Max More is in the mood for a speaking tour, but I think that we<br>
should set up inaugural meetings on campuses of Extropy Chapters that<br>
Max or another extropian leader can help kick off membership with some<br>
rousing lectures, maybe if we have some multimedia to go in the<br>
presentation....<br>
<p>
This is just the sort of stuff that I tried to motivate people for on<br>
the &gt;H list and got a bunch of crap back from the rugged individualists<br>
who didn't want to have to actually contribute to a group or make an<br>
effort. Lets hope everyone starts getting motivated.<br>
<p>
BTW, thanks for all the constructive feed back on my site. Things are<br>
more fixed than before, and I'm working on the rest...Though, I have set<br>
the text on the front page as a light tan (to look like it was carved<br>
into the wood), so I can't see how it would turn up blue.... <br>
