<p>
And government is the master at media manipulation. THey don't promise<br>
they'll clean it up, they just want to LOOK like they are advocating<br>
regulation that have the apparent purpose of makeing someone else clean<br>
things up, when the reason things were dumped before was because<br>
government gave them tax breaks to invest in certain industries, then<br>
refused to build the waste disposal facilities that the businesses<br>
needed to get rid of the waste. Sotring it was an OSHA health hazard, so<br>
they had to get rid of it somewhere. Where they put is was not the<br>
governments responsibility, so long as they didn't dump any where IN MY<br>
BACKYARD.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Businesses are subsidized more than taxed. During Reagan's "regime", they</i><br>
<i>&gt; had a large tax cut for businesses, but the poor were still worse off than</i><br>
<i>&gt; before.</i><br>
<p>
Excuse me, but income taxes have gone down, and anyone in the US who<br>
makes less than 20,000 dollars a year pays no net taxes at all, on<br>
average. Business taxes have gone up, especially on small businesses,<br>
typically owned by a husband and wife, employing less than 50 people.<br>
Big monopolistic, non-laissez faire corporations get all the tax breaks.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; THe Ogoni in Nigeria. Yet, because they have our economic support, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; don't need anybody else's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IAN: Africa has followed socialism far far more than laissez</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; faire, yet you condemn laissez faire for the problems there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't thik of a single socialist government in Africa, especially not</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nigeria. Nigeria is a fine capitalism, regardless of the military regime.</i><br>
<p>
You are obviously blind. Try Ethiopia, Botswana, Angola just to name a<br>
few off the top of my head. Due to the long history of tribal tradition,<br>
paternalistic, socialist regiemes experience high popularity. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IAN: Your claim that decentralization leads to centralization</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (therefore we need centralization to prevent decentralization)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has no basis in fact. It is regulations and taxation that reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the number of business, not the opposite. Learn about Hong Kong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You cannot decentralize the government aspect of things without giving</i><br>
<i>&gt; free reign to the business side of things. If you're going to have a free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market, you're going to need a government to keep the private interests in</i><br>
<i>&gt; check. Unless you reduce both drastically, they are both neccessary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Giving one preference is invitation to totalitarianism. Power is</i><br>
<i>&gt; centralized both on the market side and on the government side. GIving one</i><br>
<i>&gt; control over the other doesn't help much.</i><br>
<p>
Thats exactly right. Giving one exclusive power in ANY case is bad. I<br>
would say that one of the very few things government might be good for<br>
is enforcing anti trust regulations. Read Vinge's "Conquest by Default"<br>
to understand my meaning. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IAN: Socialism = universal social debt = totalitarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's an excellent blanket statement, but not much logic behind it. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't see many socialist democracies having a much oppression.</i><br>
<p>
Officially, no. Instead, dissidents are branded as lunatics. If you<br>
conception of reality does not concord with the official majority<br>
concept of reality, them you must be insane (that is the accepted<br>
definition of insanity). So consequently, you get "socialized", or<br>
"helped", or "reeducated" or simply drugged and electroshocked "for your<br>
own good".  See our way is so fine and good that you must agree that we<br>
are helping you get along. You do want to get along don't you..... Here<br>
in the US, one is not "politically correct", or is a sexist, racist,<br>
homophobe, "capitalist" (as if thats a bad thing), or baby seal killer,<br>
even though one is not any of those things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Batista, Duvalier, Suharto, and Duarte all ran with capitalism, and yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; they were, (still are in the case of Suharto), completely totalitarian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; This is because the government was run for and by the private interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Which is what I think happens with laissez faire.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IAN: Laissez faire means "leave alone."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A totalitarian govt is by definition not laissez faire.</i><br>
<p>
Capitalism promoted and developed with government support and<br>
enforcement is not Laissez faire.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They left the economy alone, which I think means laissez-faire in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; traditional sense. In fact, most of these geographic areas that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered "good investing", have a history of human rights violations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A bank teller tried to convince me to put my money in Latin America or</i><br>
<i>&gt; South East Asia, two areas that haven't had the best track records for</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Funny, huh.</i><br>
<p>
yeah funny like: Cuba, Sandinista Nicaragua, Totalitarian El Salvador,<br>
Guatamala, and Chile. None of which are ( or were in the case of<br>
Nicaragua), laissez faire economies<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I live in Canada, which is a fairly good  liberal socialism. I agree with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Banjo that capitalism needs a bit of government in order to keep it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; running amuck. ... i think we need to get a strong populist government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IAN: Well at least you've dropped the anarchist pretense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
Canada has probably had the best opportunity to offer its citizens the<br>
promise of bread and circuses of any nation in history. Since the US<br>
basically paid for the majority of its defense for the last 50 years,<br>
and benefits from the same maquiladoro type border economy as Mexico's<br>
border states, they have been basically able to write a blank check so<br>
long as their trade balance with the US has been positive. However, now<br>
that trade protections are down, and the baby boom is starting to<br>
retire, it has had to enforce a bit of fiscal sanity in order to keep<br>
from bankrupting itself. I think this is good, in s pite of the short<br>
term suffering. Dont' get me wrong, a girlfriend of mine who lives in<br>
Ontario is not very happy with a Masters in Environmental Science and<br>
unable to get a job, so I'm not an insensitive slob, but over the long<br>
run, its a good thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're going to have capitalism, you're going to have government. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; still say we drop both of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
What then? How are people going to live? Is everyone going to have their<br>
own farm, their own factory that makes everything, and their own power<br>
plant?  Granted, if (and thats still a big IF) nanotechnology fufills<br>
its sci-fi promise, then we can each have all those things, and the only<br>
two bases for trade will be information and relationships/entertainment,<br>
but that still requires free trade )i.e. laissez faire capitalism to<br>
work for maximum benefit for all, but that is still at a very minimum<br>
20-50 years down the road. Don't hold your breath.<br>
