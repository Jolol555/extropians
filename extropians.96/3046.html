IAN: As hard as this is to believe, its actually not all that, <br>
shall we say, far out. The witness report of the Air National <br>
Guard pilot, Major Meyer, is consistent with a space hit. I'm <br>
far more inclined to believe in a star wars brilliant-pebble<br>
hit than a meteor hit. Here's what would tend to support the <br>
brilliant-pebble theory. Aviation Week 7/29/96 page 32, reads:<br>
<p>
   Major Fred Meyer, a Vietnam combat veteran flying<br>
   the HH-60, was likely the first gardsman to see<br>
   Flight 800 in it's final moments. He first noticed<br>
   "at the moment of sunset....a streak of light"<br>
   above his head and about 15-20 degrees to the left<br>
   of the helicopter's centerline. <br>
<p>
   "It was on the same trajectory as a shooting star, <br>
   across the sky in front of me, generally moving <br>
   from a higher to a lower altitude." Meyer said. <br>
   The differences were that the moving light was <br>
   orange-red instead of white "and you don't see <br>
   shooting stars in broad daylight."<br>
<p>
   As the pilot focused on the light, an explosion<br>
   occurred the size of a circle made by thumb and<br>
   forefinger at arm's length. <br>
<p>
   He dismissed the notion that a SAM was involved.<br>
   "I've seen missiles fired [in combat]," said<br>
   Meyer, who flew search and rescue missions from <br>
   a ship off the coast of North Vietnam during<br>
   1966-1969. "Nothing in my experience is saying<br>
   missile."<br>
<p>
Since some reports state that the missile seemed to come<br>
from a boat, and that it curved -- unlike a meteor but<br>
like a guided missile -- it must be considered that a <br>
military agent such as Major Meyer might be persuaded<br>
to give witness contrary to what he actually saw. There<br>
are even reports, such as from the NY Post, that he<br>
said at the time that it DID look like a missile, so<br>
Major Meye, which is it? A b-pebble might fit the bill,<br>
for it might both look and not look like a missile.  <br>
<p>
However, if a star wars test error, this would be a good<br>
reason for a cover up. Not only is star wars top secret,<br>
but it such an error would threaten to kill the project<br>
if the public found out. But now back to earth, get this:<br>
<p>
        FACT 3: The U.S. Coast Guard's "Notice to Mariners" <br>
        states that the Navy planned daily live-fire exercis-<br>
        es during the month of July '96 less than 200 miles <br>
        NW of the TWA 800 explosion ( USCG notice is here<br>
        ( <a href="http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/lnm/d1/LNM0127.TXT">http://www.navcen.uscg.mil/lnm/d1/LNM0127.TXT</a> ).<br>
<p>
                LOCAL NOTICE TO MARINERS - JULY 1996<br>
<p>
                MA - OFF/SHORE - The U.S. Navy <br>
                advises of daily firing exercises...<br>
<p>
        Considering that zones off the NY shore were also re-<br>
        served for military exercises, could it be that live-<br>
        fire exercises were extended to other reserved areas?, <br>
        as eyewitness reports would indicate. It is also re-<br>
        ported that the USCG issued a notice of NY coast fir- <br>
        ings that has now been removed from their web site.<br>
        That notice would be the smoking gun.<br>
