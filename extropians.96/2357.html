Hi.<br>
<p>
I have one serious reservation regarding uploading<br>
that appears to be a real issue.  As far as I can tell, information <br>
theory would prevent the possibility of uploading.  Someone please <br>
evaluate this and tell me if I am wrong.<br>
<p>
Suppose you hypothetically uploaded a perfect clone of your brain <br>
structure to an Acme Ultracomputer X-1000.  This uploaded version of <br>
your brain is a conscious, very fast version of yourself running in <br>
cyberspace. <br>
<p>
As I see it, this would not be *your* consciousness that was <br>
uploaded.  What was uploaded was your memories, thoughts, etc., but <br>
your thread of consciousness still remains in your brain.  All you <br>
are doing by uploading is spawning a second thread of consciousness <br>
that thinks it is you.  The uploaded brain would have every reason to <br>
think it was you because every memory tells it that it is you.<br>
<p>
Assume the upload process was non-destructive.  Your human brain (and <br>
consciousness) would walk away and continue to evolve on its own <br>
thread.  Your uploaded brain would also continue to evolve, but on a <br>
separate thread of consciousness.<br>
<p>
Think of it as a piece of software.  If you create two copies of the <br>
same piece of software running on a computer at the same time, they <br>
may be identical and be in the same state initially, but they are not the <br>
same.  They occupy different places and have the opportunity to <br>
evolve independantly.<br>
<p>
The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were <br>
physical matter. Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.<br>
Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move <br>
information (as opposed to copying) is a fundamental limitation of all <br>
information systems.<br>
<p>
<p>
It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The <br>
best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.<br>
<p>
