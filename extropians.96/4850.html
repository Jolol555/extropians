<i>&gt;Moon advertisment space for rent? Check out alt.chrome.the.moon (_not_</i><br>
<i>&gt;affiliated with alt.pave.the.earth). Seriously though, with von-Neumann</i><br>
<i>&gt;probes this should be easy to do, using synchronously movable mirrors</i><br>
<i>&gt;one might even do animation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I think this is a waste of time.  The moon makes a fine light, but it<br>
isn't big enough to print anything on that you could read.  All screwing<br>
with it would likely do is dim the light and piss people off.  I certainly<br>
know that if you dimmed the moon _I'd_ be pissed off.  I'm also not<br>
prepared to guarantee that there aren't species that depend on the moon<br>
being just the way it is for their survival -- and for me that would be<br>
the last straw.  How many species might not be able to mate if there were<br>
less light, or might all be eaten if there were more, or couldn't see their<br>
food if the light were a different color, or whatever?<br>
<p>
Go play your games with the moon over a manmade planet.<br>
