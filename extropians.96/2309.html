A good post from Chris Hind, but I do disagree with one thing.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The way I wish to be uploaded will be through gradual                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;incremental uploading so that "I" will be the uploaded,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;virtual, digital, being rather than a digital duplicate                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;running around as me. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
A gradual upload might be a good idea for practical reasons, you could catch <br>
any bugs in the procedure before they caused serious harm, but I don't see <br>
how it would make any difference from a philosophical viewpoint. Since all <br>
the atoms in our bodies are constantly changing and information is the thing <br>
that makes me be me and you be you, I don't think it's meaningful to <br>
differentiate between a "copy" and the "original" of a person. Are copies of <br>
Windows 95 inferior to the "original", whatever that means?<br>
<p>
If I have not convinced you it's because you only read a copy of this post, <br>
the original, as it appeared on my computer screen when I typed it, was much <br>
better.<br>
