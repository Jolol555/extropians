That's not a good analogy to Nanotechnology, but you can turn it into one if  <br>
you make 2 slight adjustments. (NOTE: I use the term "slight adjustments" in  <br>
the same spirit you did in a previous post.)<br>
<p>
1) Instead of having one Bechtel and one IBM etc, there are trillions of them. <br>
2) Each Bechtel or IBM is able to make an exact copy of itself, of the same   <br>
   size and the same quality, in a few days, perhaps a few hours.<br>
<p>
It's a straw man to keep talking about things being free, but In such a world  <br>
the supply of engineering services would be astronomically larger than it is <br>
now, and the last time I looked at an Economics text book the supply of  <br>
something is an important factor determining the cost of that thing.<br>
                      <br>

<i>                &gt;Drexler's "dizzying prospect" doesn't depend on moving atoms                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;one by one -- that's a red herring. What makes the prospect                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;dizzying is the idea that entities with at-least-human                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;intelligence will do our bidding.  </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
To design interesting structures intelligence is very handy to have, it  <br>
certainly makes things happen MUCH faster, but it isn't absolutely necessary,  <br>
just look at evolution. As for manufacturing, that doesn't need intelligence <br>
at all. Ribosomes would score a zero on a IQ test, yet they can make EXTREMELY<br>
complex proteins if they receive the correct digital information that tells <br>
them how from messenger RNA. Actually they can do even better than that, <br>
as long as they receive the correct digital information that tells the how to <br>
do it they can make even more complex objects, objects like you and me.<br>
                      <br>
This doesn't mean there won't be super human artificial intelligence, there  <br>
most certainly will be, I just want to point out that a lot can happen even <br>
without it.           <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;Why would a mite-sized Exxon take orders from me, when the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;actual Exxon wouldn't? </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
In other words, would you or me have any control over all this? I don't know. <br>
I never said we would be rich, or that we would even be around, I only said  <br>
that the price of things will drop to almost, but not quite, zero. I am not <br>
at all convinced that we will survive the turmoil of the singularity, <br>
but we might, at least it's a chance, and without it we are all doomed to old <br>
age and oblivion. That is reason for hope, and at the very least, things <br>
won't be dull.<br>
