Prolly true. It's just from what I've seen so far I get that impression and<br>
I DO hope I'm wrong. My problem is that how are we going to get over the<br>
problems such as creating robots flexible enough to manuver around objects<br>
with a non-uniform surface. I'm sure the answer is probably out there but I<br>
just don't see robotics as the way to go when combination bio/robotic would<br>
add the best of both worlds. I see both used together-- you see them<br>
seporately. I just haven't seen much breakthrough development in this area.<br>
If you know of some tell me. Because what is bio? Basically it's nature's<br>
robots and their parts are much smaller than robot parts which make them<br>
more efficent and flexible. All we need to do is engineer metalloids into<br>
the bio format somehow. I don't see robots (ie. Data from StarTrek) I see<br>
Cyborgs (man &amp; machine).<br>
