After three hundred years of effort Fermat's Last Theorem was proved the old <br>
fashioned way, with pencil and paper, but it's true that the equally famous <br>
4 color map problem was proved by a computer<br>

<p>
It's more likely that a computer will find a counterexample, that is, <br>
by trial and error find an even number that is not the sum of 2 primes. <br>
You can't prove  there is no such number by trial and error, there are too <br>
many even numbers for that. To prove there is no such number you need a proof.  <br>
Even if we are someday able to solve this problem, we know for sure there are<br>
other problems we can not solve, and to make things even worse, we have no <br>
way of knowing  what those problems are.<br>

<p>
In other words, in general there is no way to understand if a computer can  <br>
solve the problem we give it or not.<br>

<i>                &gt;wait for the computation to complete. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
But we might be waiting, not for a long time, but quite literally forever.  <br>
Unlike a something like factoring a number, where it's easy to find an upper <br>
bound on the amount of computer time needed to find a solution, with some  <br>
problems the only upper bound we can find is infinity. It could be that it's <br>
futile to keep waiting for an answer, but there is no way we can ever know  <br>
it's futile, so we end up running the program forever.<br>
