(This time I'll just pick up where the last post left off.  I apologize for<br>
the use of bandwidth.)<br>
<p>
...technology is neither placed on a pedestal nor staked through the heart .<br>
. . .<br>
<p>
[I take it that the reviewer means to say that Dery treats technology<br>
even-handedly -- not that those wacky Extropians do.  To wit:]<br>
<p>
He saves his strongest language for the "techno-transcendentalists"--those<br>
whose "visions of a cyber-rapture are a fatal seduction, distracting us from<br>
the devastation of nature, the unraveling of the social fabric, and the<br>
widening chasm between the technocratic elite and the minimum-wage masses."<br>
<p>
[I guess we've never discussed those topics in our various fora, eh?]<br>
<p>
    Belief in the cyber-Rapture constitutes, for Dery, evangelism of "a<br>
theology of the ejector seat."  For the believers in the techno-millennium,<br>
technological acceleration has proceeded to such a point that humanity is<br>
about to be launched into a great unknown. <br>
<p>
* * *<br>
<p>
    Poppycock.  Or as Dery more eloquently puts it: "The misguided hope that<br>
we will be born again as bionic angels,' to quote Mondo 2000, is a deadly<br>
misreading of the myth of learus.  It pins our future to wings of wax and<br>
feathers."<br>
<p>
* * *<br>
<p>
Dery reserves special scorn for the true believers in cyber-salvation: "Thus,<br>
we are drawn to the inescapable conclusion that much of what passes for<br>
post-humanism is in fact egoism leavened with a dash of technocratic elitism,<br>
whether it is Mondo 2000's dictatorship of the neurotariat--the shrapies,<br>
mutants and superbrights in whom we must place our 'faith' and 'power' or the<br>
Extropian triumph of the overman."<br>
<p>
    Nicely said, but Dery is perhaps too kind to the Mondoids and Extropians.<br>
 Are they worth the attention?  As with malfunctioning computer programs, one<br>
wonders if they even merit debugging.<br>
<p>
[Such vitriol!  The reviewer certainly does not address the substance of<br>
Extropianism's arguments.  Does Dery?]<br>
<p>
* * *<br>
<p>
The posthumanists are a weak straw person to counterpoint Dery's frequent<br>
allusions to the greater societal problems being submerged by the digital<br>
deluge.  Dery would have done better to load more fully into his sights the<br>
real target--Wired-style techno-positivity.  It isn't as sexy, and it long<br>
ago lost its subcultural cachet, but as far as social reality is concerned,<br>
Wired's aestheticizing of techno-politics is the real "Mechagodzilla."<br>
<p>
[I jibe,  "A spectre is haunting this book reviewer:  The spectre of dynamic<br>
optimism."  Seriously, though, if you find this hack's review dismaying you<br>
should keep in mind that the market place for ideas can work slowly.<br>
 Consider that the Communist Manifesto originally issued in 1848 -- long,<br>
long before its tenets had real impact.]<br>
