But it can only be tilt so much, a particle will always remain within its  <br>
light cone, if not then it would not only move faster than light it would  <br>
move back in time, and that has never been observed and is thought by most to <br>
be impossible.<br>
<p>
Well OK, Tipler found a solution in General Relativity that shows that an  <br>
infinitely long, extremely dense cylinder made of Neutronium (the stuff of  <br>
Neutron Stars) and spinning at almost the speed of light would be able to tip  <br>
a light cone enough to act as a time machine, but there are two very important <br>
problems.<br>
<p>
1) Nobody knows if a cylinder of finite length would work also, the math is <br>
   too difficult to figure out.<br>
<p>
2) The very rapid rotation would cause the cylinder to fly apart. This is <br>
   much more than just an Engineering difficulty, no known force in Physics <br>
   would be strong enough to hold the cylinder together, not even the strong <br>
   nuclear force. For this to work new Physics would need to be found, which <br>
   is just another way of saying that as far as we know now it's impossible.<br>
