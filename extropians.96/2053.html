On Sat, 19 Oct 1996 Suresh Naidu &lt;snaidu@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca&gt; Wrote:<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Dignity comes with freedom   </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Correct, and you want to take away the freedom of people in the third world <br>
to work how they want to work because you think you know what's best for them, <br>
better than the workers themselves.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;visit a sweatshop. Nobody likes working  there. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Not true! They like working there much better than not working there, that's <br>
why they're working there. I'm a little embarrassed at pointing out something <br>
so obvious but apparently it's necessary, and yes, I realize it's a tautology, <br>
but condemn them all you want, tautologies do have one great virtue, they're <br>
true.            <br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;A choice between wage-slavery and starving is not much of a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;choice. </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
And in the name of morality you will eliminate that unpleasant choice the poor <br>
must make by eliminating his wages. It would be more humane to shoot him in <br>
the head, starvation is not a pleasant way to die.<br>
<p>
                     <br>
<i>              &gt;If everybody was treated with mutual respect in libertarianism               </i><br>
<i>              &gt;then it would succeed, but that is the case with any form of               </i><br>
<i>              &gt;government or lack thereof. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Love is a wonderful thing, but it is very rare, even Nanotechnology can't <br>
supply that particular commodity in abundance. One reason Socialism always <br>
fails is that it demands a huge amount of love, far more than the Human Race, <br>
or even the Transhuman Race, could ever supply. Some people just don't like<br>
some people. Readers of this list will find it hard to believe but incredible <br>
as it sounds, some people don't even like me!<br>
         <br>
I don't want to rely on the kindness of strangers, because that kindness is <br>
not reliable. The farmer who grows food does not love me, the trucker who <br>
moves that food does not love me, the grocer who sells that food  does not <br>
love me, yet the market organizes all these people and many more in such a <br>
way that they put food on my table.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;with jobs rotated, everybody has the opportunity to clean                 </i><br>
                toilets  <br>
                  <br>
<p>
That's exactly what China did in the cultural revelation, they made hart <br>
surgeons, the lucky ones they didn't kill for the crime of being educated,  <br>
clean toilets. They forced Nobel Prize wining scientists at the point of a <br>
bayonet to plow rice fields. That was over 20 years ago and science in China  <br>
is only now starting to recover. Is this really a model you want to follow?<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>               &gt;scientific progress would increase through a better education                </i><br>
<i>               &gt;system that educates all, rather than those who can afford it.  </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Theories must always be based a the bedrock of fact, let's see if the <br>
experimental data supports your theory. In the poorest slums Socialism <br>
provides the schools, in those same slums Capitalism provides the cars.  <br>
There are FAR more good cars than good schools in those slums.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;everybody will respect your property rights.    </i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
You said that private property was the source of all evil, now you're talking <br>
about my property rights, I don't think you've thought this through.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;you'll have to ask permission to build your house. You can't                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;arbitrarily go out and use public resources without asking.    </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Wow, what a huge change that would be! Today I must get a building permit, <br>
but in your world I must get permission to build, two completely different <br>
things.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The advantage of the commune system is that one can leave                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and join another commune that works more appropriatly to                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;your beliefs. </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
In your world Capitalism is not allowed anywhere, what would be the point in <br>
leaving a commune if you compel me to join another one exactly like it?<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;you can leave, so nobody will get angry at you. Just pick up                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and go join someone else before people get pissed off at you.</i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
I don't want to "join someone else" I just want the Socialists leaches to <br>
leave me the hell alone, I am perfectly willing to leave them alone.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;it's going to be very hard to oppress somebody when they can                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;leave to a place where they actually have a say. So you'll                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;have a commune of capitalist owners with nobody to employ.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I would be quite happy to take that risk, but from what you've said before I <br>
don't think you're sincere about letting me do this. As soon as it becomes <br>
obvious that the Capitalist commune (a contradiction in terms if there ever <br>
was one) is prospering I fear the socialist army will put it out of business <br>
because Suresh Naidu  has decreed it to be "unfair". Please, tell me I'm<br>
wrong about that.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Ever notice how the most staunch defenders of capitalism are                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the ones who benefit from it the most. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
I think it's an object fact that capitalism can produce wealth faster than <br>
any other known system, I also think it's fair, but that's a subjective call <br>
and you're correct, I can't claim to be unbiased because I have benefited <br>
personally from capitalism, just like everybody else.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Victims of capitalism tend not to support it as rabidly as                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the businessmen.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I wouldn't know anything about that, I've never heard of victims of <br>
capitalism,  although I've certainly heard of poor people.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;you give the factory to those who work in it.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
And how will this mob make business decisions? How much steel should we make <br>
next year and what types? Should we make more pig iron or stainless steel? <br>
What sort of iron ore should we buy and from who? Who should we get to <br>
transport it? Where should we get our coal? Should we make our own coke or <br>
buy it from somebody else? Should we give ourselves a rase or use that money <br>
to purchase new  equipment so we can make Vanadium steel? Should we branch <br>
out and start making composite fiber material or is that too risky? <br>
If you can tell me with a straight face that having the workers vote on all <br>
this and much more would produce better decisions than the market, then you <br>
must be a very good poker player. <br>
                            <br>
<p>
<i>                          &gt;&gt;Democracy sucks. . </i><br>
                           <br>
<i>                &gt;Yeah! Lets have a dictatorship. Bill Gates and Lee Iaccoca                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;are our rulers! Damn anyone who can't afford to pay for                 </i><br>
                justice.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
Democracy doesn't work because elections are dumb, an idiotic way of <br>
communicating your wishes, there are  much better ways. Every day I send  <br>
hundreds of exquisitely precise messages to the Free Market telling it what  <br>
I want it to do. I also get to compare brands, I can't do that In a democracy <br>
because I'm not voting for goods or services or even policies, I just get to<br>
choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years, and democracy is the <br>
best form of government, the best of a bad lot.<br>
 <br>
When I vote in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it,  <br>
I always win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it.  <br>
At any rate, the chances that my vote will influence things is so small  <br>
that it's not worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is <br>
that the politician with the better hairdo gets to make the decisions.<br>
                <br>
