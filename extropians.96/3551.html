He may be eccentric, but his reputation in physics is very solid.  The real<br>
pioneer in this area was Sakharov, but I don't know what happened to him.<br>
Sakharov proposed much of what they are researching now in the 1970s, but no<br>
one really paid too much attention to him until Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff<br>
made some important leaps in the early '90s.<br>
