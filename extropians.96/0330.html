<i>&gt;Does anyone know of any studies (preferably with good methodology) analyzing</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible psychological differences between persons born the traditional way</i><br>
<i>&gt;vs. those born by Caesarian section?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Welcome to the field of perinatal psychology. I believe there is an association<br>
concerned with this topic; I recall a conference announcement many years<br>
ago. There<br>
is a book (Which I have not read), titled "Through a Different Doorway" (or<br>
similar)<br>
which is about the differences with Cesarian births.<br>
<p>
I have discussed this topic with Stanislav Grof. His informal impressions<br>
are that<br>
C section people are closer to what is called Transpersonal experiences, and<br>
less<br>
well grounded. Not exactly study material here, but an impression of being less<br>
"in the world" and more impractical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some psychoanalysts make claims about the traumatic effects of birth. I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;like to see some evidence.</i><br>
<p>
"LSD Psychotherapy" by Stanislav Grof is the primary work in this field.<br>
It is now available in paperback, and I highly recommend it.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm also curious as to whether, if there is anything in the claims that such</i><br>
<i>&gt;early experiences affect adult psychology, the birth experience could</i><br>
<i>&gt;explain the frequent reports of a tunnel in near death experiences.</i><br>
<p>
All of this stuff is tied together. Birth and Death are closely connected; <br>
Grof maintains that the birth process involves a close encounter with death.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The NDE</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience of travelling down a tunnel into the light suggests the</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility of a replaying of the birth experience. One way to investigate</i><br>
<i>&gt;this would be to see if all people having such an NDE were born the typical</i><br>
<i>&gt;way. If so, we'd have a nice explanation of the basic near death experience.</i><br>
<p>
I doubt this one. I once saw a note in Science News (3-6 years ago) reporting<br>
a study concerning medical life threatening emergencies and NDEs. There were<br>
four combinations:<br>
<p>
    Real Emergency, Patient aware of it    = NDE<br>
    Real Emergency, Patient unaware        = no NDE<br>
    Not Emergency, Patient thinks real     = NDE<br>
    Not Emergency, Patient thinks not real = no NDE<br>
<p>
I read in two different sources that Penfield in his brain stimulation<br>
experiments<br>
discovered in the Sylvan Fissure a location which induced NDEs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suspect that the actual explanation is more likely to be in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt;traumatic chemical events in the brain inducing experiences common to all</i><br>
<i>&gt;cultures due to shared brain features. There are certain common patterns</i><br>
<i>&gt;experienced by everyone on psychedelics regardless of their cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt;background. One of these is a tunnel-like effect. This might be the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect generated in NDE's.</i><br>
<p>
Ronald Siegel has a book on psychedelic patterens, including tunnel visions.<br>
<p>
I have a paper (under a pile somewhere) which discusses white light experiences<br>
as related to anoxia in the brain via the Circle of Willits. Anoxia also causes<br>
tunnel vision. Some Yogic breathing exercises induce anoxia.<br>
<p>
Ketamine at 1.5 mg/kg (about 2x the usual psychedelic dose, about 15% of the<br>
surgical dose) induces experiences very similiar to NDEs. Unfortunately there <br>
is a lot of ammnesia in these expereinces (unless done at the peak of LSD). My<br>
expereinces reminded me a lot of the bardo states described in the Tibetan Book<br>
of the Dead.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyone know of any studies in the area? The NDE is a common argument for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility of life after death. I'm interested in strengthening arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt;against the NDE claim for believing in an afterlife.</i><br>
<p>
My standard argument is that if there is a brain structure which promotes NDEs,<br>
this is evolutionarily plausible as NDEs will serve to knit tribal social<br>
structures<br>
together which is a strong survival plus. The NDE itself is just another meme,<br>
burdened with the overwhelming experince of its being the ultimate reality. Sort<br>
of like the volume set at 200% of like Totally Real. Those without experience<br>
of rational thinking will tend to accept this without quesion, and once this<br>
meme<br>
is imprinted, little can be done about it.<br>
