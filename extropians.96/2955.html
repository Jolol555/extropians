<p>
Well, it is not "breaking", it is a simple, sharp phase transition from <br>
the precisely defined point in state (=conformation space, form follows <br>
function (aka mapping (folding) of a linear polymer (string), a <br>
precisely defined, intricate 3-shape, which maps to the task space of <br>
that particular protein in a wet context)) to a wide variety (a very <br>
large region of energetically accessible state space) of denaturated <br>
structures. This phase transition is large-scale property, where lots of <br>
uniquely arranged amino acids in a protein chain "don't show their face". <br>
(A somewhat contraintuitive insight, since usually we're not expecting <br>
such simple behaviour from an archetypally complex system ;)<br>
<p>
It might be irreversible, it might not. Proteins are molecular machines, <br>
their folding pathways and kinetics have been careful optimized by the <br>
Darwinian evolution generator process. Even so, the stuff sometime <br>
misfolds, and has either be marked for destruction, or carefully massaged <br>
(annealed) by the chaperonine chaps, i.e. hsps.<br>
<p>
Predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its primary structure <br>
(sequence string) is _the_ Holy Grail of computational biology. Protein <br>
engineering, de novo design and thus soft nanotech are the next logical <br>
steps, then.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;whites get white when you boil them. Using different elements at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;energy bond points than is used for normal temp organisms allows for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;much higher temperature tolerance, as the bonds are much tighter, and</i><br>
<p>
I can assure you, extreme thermophiles bugs use exactly the same amino <br>
acids as the rest of us, just in a different sequence. A single point <br>
mutation can increase the stability of a protein dramatically.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;require higher energy input to break them apart, however this makes for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a very tightly bound molecule that only does its chemical work at a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;higher temperature. For example, a common protein in bacteria which uses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;iron in its makeup, has a corollary protein in hyperthermophilic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bacteria (bacteria that can live above boiling) that uses tungsten</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;instead.  </i><br>
<p>
Ok, so you're refering to the cofactors. But this is fringe adaptation, <br>
the rest of the beastie is still conventional. (You're not referring ;) <br>
to Cytochrome C, do you? Do they actually use tungsten instead of iron?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;These bacteria have been recovered from deep sea volcanic vents, deep</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;oil wells, and deep geothermal systems, and have exhibitied preference</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for temperatures above 180 degrees F (about 90 C) up to as much as 275 F</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(about 130 C). As more varieties are recovered, the upper limit seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;creep higher, especially as specimens are recovered from deeper and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;deeper sites.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, there are some organisms who can thrive in this environment, but their</i><br>
<i>&gt; makeup is significantly different than surface dwelling organisms.  The</i><br>
<p>
Molecular structure or plain morphology? They're archae, they're sure <br>
simple bugs. Can you specify what you mean by makeup?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; pressure where they live allows liquid water reactions to continue to occur.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even then, there is a soft limit somewhere around 150-170 C for most</i><br>
<i>&gt; organics.  The absolute hard limit on any planet is somewhere around 375 C</i><br>
<p>
Certainly for proteins, for aquathermal water is a fierce solute. There <br>
are lots of organic compounds which can survive hefty temperatures, <br>
however. NASA uses polymers capable of withstanding 1500 deg C for short <br>
periods, noticeably lower temps for indefinite time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; since this is where water goes supercritical, although very few organics</i><br>
<p>
Uh oh, this is a seriously bad customer. Whether sand or gold, it <br>
dissolves about anything. Many minerals are of geohydrothermal origin. <br>
Quartz crystals (which are used for computer and clock xtals) are grown <br>
in autoclaves by a hydrothermal process (specifically: a transport <br>
reaction in a temperature gradient).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; would survive even to this point (except maybe some halides and a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; proteins).  Cells require a pretty broad spectrum of organic compounds to</i><br>
<p>
I beg to differ, only the biopolymer stuff. I doubt steroids will notice <br>
much of it. Just remember the hopanes in microfossils.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; operate, and the number of options decreases rapidly as the temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; increases.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sub-zero lifeforms are not that unusual, although it is unusual for higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifeforms to exist in these environments.  In an environment that is</i><br>
<p>
Arctic fishes can exist in contiguous (slightly) subzero habitats. <br>
They've developed a paraphernalia of methods to cope with this harsh <br>
environments, particularly advanced cryprotectives, basically <br>
poisoning ice nucleation. They are also using lots of slime in sensitive <br>
(gill) areas to prevent ice microcrystals from crossing over into the <br>
bloodstream. <br>
<p>
For more, have a look at:<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; perpetually subzero, I would expect to find either very primitive nervous</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems, or nervous systems that operated in a different fashion than ours.</i><br>
<p>
Well, they don't use saltatory spike propagation, but everything else is <br>
canonical. Ok, their lipide bilayer composition is significantly more <br>
fluid, to prevent phase transitions to a 2d crystal, which is not <br>
exactly something desirable. Membrane fluidity is dynamically adjusted, <br>
by expression of the right genes at the right time in the right <br>
quantity. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The nervous systems found on this planet don't operate well in cold</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments, since they rely on ion/molecule transport.  This is why</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals found in cold climates on this planet require immense quantities of</i><br>
<i>&gt; insulation.</i><br>
<p>
It ain't only the CNS, the entire metabolism requires a precisely defined <br>
point in parameter space. Each reaction shows different response to <br>
change in parameters, so if you're too much off-key, you're dead. (A <br>
toast of deuterium oxide to that).<br>
