<p>
I found it at a Borders Bookstore but I think any urban bookstore with a<br>
large selection of periodicals should have it.  It's a hard magazine to<br>
classify so I'm not sure what section you look in.  The cover is deep<br>
blue, with MONDO in unusual lettering across the top and two futuristic<br>
female models with silverized hair.<br>

Charles Ostman, the Mondo science editor posted to this list re: Neural<br>
Connections on Tuesday, October 08, 1996 8:17PM and left some URLs. I<br>
tried the mondo2000 one but it was awfully slow (probably alot of<br>
graphics) and gave up:<br>

Some of the tech articles include:<br>
people-tracking with subdermal implants, biokinetics and real-object<br>
capture for VR, bidirectional tactile response interfaces, 'scent<br>
organs', and Ostman's "Head Cheese on Wry" column (which I haven't had a<br>
chance to read yet) that is precisely about the things discussed on this<br>
thread: whether thought patterns can be stored and retrieved, monitored,<br>
overriden and communicated to others.<br>

P.S. There's also a fascinating interview with Mark Pesce, co-inventor<br>
of VRML, where he talks about "cyber ecology" and VR on the World Wide<br>
Web:<br>
&lt;The idea is to take the original database - which is the planet - and<br>
establish a superstructure for people to recreate the planet<br>
collaboratively on the Web ... We're opening ourselves up to mediations<br>
that can mutate ... they can start leading us around ... to create<br>
harmony between what's in and what's out, and it appears they're<br>
somewhat reflective ... Perhaps the Internet will serve as a reality<br>
condom [so that we can] spend our time in the real world as sacred<br>
time.&gt;<br>
