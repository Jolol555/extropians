<i>&gt; Yes, but I think that most people here want to *experience* the</i><br>

<i>&gt; program running that would swear it was us, and would in fact be us,</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
Well.... I AM a cryonicist, which implies an interruption in the stream<br>
of consciousness. I can't prove I am not already in an uploaded state,<br>
simulating my mundane physical existence. Perhaps "god" loaded me from<br>
a backup this morning....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For information to exist it must be encoded.  This *requires* that</i><br>
<i>&gt; information can only be copied or destroyed.  "New" information is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only the reorganization of existing information into a format that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaningful to us.  Even our imaginations are constrained by the limits of</i><br>
<i>&gt; our experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Not quite. It's information AND the system which uses it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I am not mistaken, the "Information can not be moved, only copied"</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorem has been proven mathematically.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree. Information is readily sent via moving media, whether a disk<br>
in snail mail or a laser beam...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, this reflects</i><br>
<i>&gt; the strong entropic property  of information.</i><br>
<p>
Please explain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am not saying it is impossible to upload; it is impossible only in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sense of uploading a single, existing stream of consciousness as opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating a new stream of consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, this argument sounds like "soul" to me. If the SOC is based<br>
in<br>
information, it can be copied, uploaded, etc. If not, I see creeping<br>
vitalism<br>
here. IMHO, the SOC is actually information whose content is along the<br>
lines<br>
of "I exist" and consistency in the memories of same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This, of course, IS the big question.  If consciousness is based upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; information and information processing, my above statements hold.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; not, then everything I said becomes irrelevant to the question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Per the above, you have this backwards.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally, I believe that consciousness is a result of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; architecture of our information storage and processing systems.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; this was not the case, we would be delving into the fuzzy world of</i><br>
<i>&gt; metaphysics.</i><br>
<p>
Almost all discussions of consciousness are metaphysics.<br>
