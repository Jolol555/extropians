Subject: UCLA short course on "Evolutionary Computation"<br>
<p>
<p>
On February 19-21, 1997, UCLA Extension will present the short course,<br>
"Evolutionary Computation: Principles and Applications", on the UCLA<br>
campus in Los Angeles.<br>
<p>
The instructors are Melanie Mitchell, PhD, Research Professor, Santa Fe<br>
Institute; Richard Belew, PhD, Associate Professor, Computer Science,<br>
UC San Diego; Lawrence Davis, PhD, President, Tica Associates; and<br>
Una-May O'Reilly, PhD, Research Fellow, AI Laboratory, MIT.<br>
<p>
Each participant receives a copy of the book, " An Introduction to Genetic <br>
Algorithms", M. Mitchell (MIT Press 1996), and extensive course notes.<br>
<p>
This course introduces engineers, scientists, and other interested<br>
participants to the burgeoning field of evolutionary computation.<br>
Evolutionary computation--genetic algorithms, evolution strategies,<br>
evolutionary programming, and genetic programming--is a collection of <br>
computational techniques, inspired by biological evolution, to enhance<br>
optimization, design, and machine learning.  Such techniques are<br>
increasingly used to great advantage in applications as diverse as<br>
aeronautical design, factory scheduling, bioengineering, electronic circuit<br>
design, telecommunications network configuration, and robotic control.<br>
<p>
Four of the leading experts in this field present the fundamentals of<br>
evolutionary computation which should enable participants to write their<br>
own evolutionary computation applications.  The course includes detailed <br>
descriptions of many applications, as well as how to design genetic<br>
algorithms and other methods for problems of interest to the participants.  <br>
Comparisons of genetic algorithms with other search and learning methods<br>
are discussed in the context of the example applications.<br>
<p>
The last day focuses on identifying promising areas for genetic algorithm <br>
optimization, and creating a genetic algorithm that performs well on your<br>
optimization problems.<br>
<p>
Course participants who wish to present a problem on the last day are<br>
encouraged to contact Dr. Davis (davis@tica.com; phone [617] 864-2292)<br>
prior to the course to determine its usefulness as an example.  The<br>
instructors hope to use two examples to illustrate the points made on the<br>
final day.<br>
<p>
The course fee is $1395, which includes extensive course materials.<br>
These materials are for participants only, and are not for sale.<br>
<p>
