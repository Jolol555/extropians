I'm familiar with a case of someone similarly taking a 1/4 street dose of<br>
LSD-25 during a second attempt at the ACT (a test quite similar to the SAT).<br>
 The auto-experimental subject allegedly had done well the first time--in the<br>
90 percentiles--but got a 99 %-tile score the second time through.  So far as<br>
I can tell, moreover, the person in question remains bright and lucid.  <br>
<p>
This interesting anecdote hardly qualifies as a double-blind study, of<br>
course, but it does (if true) disprove over-broad claims about LSD-25's<br>
allegedly universal and harmful effects.<br>
