Chris, uploading means to bekome God. Not god, but God. It means you <br>
_define_ your own physics. The geometry of spacetime (or whatever you <br>
use for spacetime), the properties of the objects (if any) it contains, <br>
etc. etc.<br>
<p>
This is way beyond wildest magick.<br>
<p>
What is possible, is limited solely by your imagination, and the <br>
computation/minimal signal latency constraints achievable. (The latter <br>
only if you are concerned with efficiency reasons).<br>
<p>
Trying to predict, how artificial reality will look like, which Beings it <br>
will inhabit, and by which motivations these Beings will be driven <br>
(economies?!) is quite quite a loss of time. Because artificial Beings <br>
will be different.<br>
<p>
Count on it.<br>
