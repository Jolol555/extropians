Hofstadter in GOEDEL, ESCHER, BACH, liked to talk about Jumping Out Of The<br>
System so much that he made an acronym for it: jootsing. One of his ideas<br>
there seemed to be that the crux of intelligence is identifying orderly<br>
systems... and then jumping out of their limits. And one of the things he<br>
seemed to be hinting at in that book is that this is a necessarily endless<br>
process.<br>
