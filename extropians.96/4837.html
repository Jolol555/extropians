Interesting. I have been thinking of a way to avoid tracking of who sent<br>
what to who: the participants (who may or may not have anything in common<br>
other than participating in the group) use encrypted mailing software that<br>
sends each mail to all others. Only the intended recipient can decrypt it,<br>
the software of the others just disregards it once they have deduced it<br>
wasn't for them. By also sending padding messages with no decryptable<br>
content in a statistically determined way traffic analysis ought to become<br>
very hard, perhaps impossible. <br>
<p>
The drawback is the waste of bandwidth, but it is much simpler to use <br>
than the dining cryptographers. Writing the software seems to be <br>
relatively trivial script-writing; the problem is to make a good protocol <br>
and ensure that it is hard to break. <br>
