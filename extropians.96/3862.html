Posters here have effectively convinced me that, given the<br>
assumptions of Hal's shooting room problem, I should expect a 1/36<br>
chance of seeing double-sixes condition on being in the room. <br>
Thank you all for your clear thinking.  <br>
<p>
This problem is an explicit counter-example to the doomsday argument.<br>
That is, there are things one could know such that the doomsday<br>
argument shouldn't concern one.  Doomsday argument proponent John<br>
Leslie, however, explicitly acknowledges this fact, and counters with<br>
the claim that we are not in such a state of knowledge.<br>
<p>
Leslie is confused about why exactly this shooting room problem is a<br>
counter example - he thinks it has something to do with<br>
"non-determinism", which I think is just sloppy thinking.  (And since<br>
Leslie thinks this type of issue is not modelable with Bayesian<br>
reasoning, this is his excuse for not offering exact Bayesian<br>
calculations for his arguments.)  But Leslie is probably right in<br>
saying that his Doomsday argument may have punch, given our actual<br>
state of ignorance.<br>
<p>
Consider the case where we are a priori uncertain about the rule used<br>
to say if the room occupants win.  There is a 50/50 chance that they<br>
win on double sixes, and a 50/50 chance they win on any double.  You<br>
can't tell which rule is being used, even when you go into a room.<br>
Now what odds should you assign to winning?  <br>
<p>
The doomsday argument says it should be much nearer to 1/6 than to<br>
1/36.  Yet if you don't know how many people are in the room with you,<br>
I think it would have to be nearer to 1/36, the opposite bias!  I<br>
think you do get the bias Leslie expects, however, if you can see how<br>
many people are in the room with you.  (Anyone want to work through<br>
the details?)<br>
