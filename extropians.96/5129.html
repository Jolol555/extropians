since the cannibalism thread is still continuing, here's a little something<br>
that happened this christmas. Attention, if you have a weak stomach, or<br>
intend to eat something later this day, don't read on !!!<br>
<p>
Every now and then i visit my parents farm, but when it gets colder, mice<br>
come in the old farmhouse, and deprive me of my sleep. What i've always done<br>
is set mouse traps, and because i'm a light sleeper (i wake up from the<br>
sound the trap makes when it snaps), i can occasionally save the mouse's<br>
life, after which i put it in a bucket or something, and set it free in the<br>
morning, in the barn that is furthest from the house. <br>
<p>
This night i cought two mice. The first one got 'lucky' and just got his<br>
head cought it the trap, it had no visible wounds. I put the mouse in a<br>
transparent champagne cooler (don't ask me why, we use it to clean the<br>
aquarium) and put a large book on top of it. The second mouse wasn't so<br>
lucky, the metal of the trap must have hit him hard, beacuse the mouse was<br>
lying on his back a few inches from the trap, when i picked it up, it was<br>
still alive, showed no open wounds, but its fore legs we're paralyzed. I put<br>
it in the same champagne cooler... <br>
<p>
I woke up again a few times that night from the sounds the first mouse made<br>
trying to jump out, and saw that the second mouse had died. I also saw that<br>
he now had a big open wound on his hip. I went back sleep, but when i woke<br>
up the next morning i saw the second mouse had a second open wound in his<br>
neck. Later i saw the first mouse eating from it. <br>
<p>
In my youth on the farm, i saw similar events happen with chickens (they<br>
also loved dinner left overs, including cooked chicken meat !) and Pigs<br>
(who'll eat anything !)<br>
<p>
I wonder if cannibalism may be an additional explanation for how some types<br>
of homidids may have dissapeared ?<br>
