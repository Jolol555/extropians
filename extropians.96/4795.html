<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; Mao?  I figure a bunch of capitalists may as well beat them to the punch.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  After all, as anyone who's read "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" knows,</i><br>
<i>&gt; whoever's sitting at the top of the gravity well can pretty much call the</i><br>
<i>&gt; shots.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd be interested in finding out if anyone else has already come up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; plans for this.  Just for kicks, I'd also appreciate your evaluation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the feasibility of this venture.  For example, how big would the board</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to be to be visible, could we use solar power to power it, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

"The Man Who Sold the Moon" by Robert A. Heinlein. DD Harriman financed<br>
his moon rocket with the same blatant commercial streak as the Artemis<br>
Project is currently doing. One of the things Heinlein had Harriman do<br>
was approach one cola manufacturer about putting their logo on the moon,<br>
then going to the other to pay him twice as much to put no logo there.<br>
Doing something like this would be an interesting test to see if purists<br>
would be willing to pay for the right to keep the moon in its original<br>
state. Blackmail with advertising.<br>
<p>
ALl youd really need to to do to make it work would be a large laser<br>
collimator in the L1 lagrange point, in front of the moon, so to speak<br>
which would illuminate whatever messages you wish to make, using the<br>
moon as a projection screen. Youd probably get the best effect using the<br>
dark side of the moon (in the wane-new-waxing phases). THis way you<br>
could use the moon as a billborad during the day, and leave it "pure" or<br>
undisturbed at night, or what the hell screw the romantics. TO power the<br>
laser system, you'd need to project enough light to equal the 2 kW/m^2<br>
flux of the sun on the lunar surface, and approximately double this if<br>
you  wished to use the sun illuminated areas. With a 1500 mile diameter,<br>
thats 10.8 x 10^6 m^2, not counting the diffractive effects of<br>
tangential areas. You then would need to determine the resolution you<br>
wished to project, as well as the refresh rate of your pictures.<br>
<p>
Basically, the amount of the lunar surface you want to illuminate at any<br>
given time determines the amount of solar collectors you would need,<br>
minus the efficiency of solar cells in space, about 33%, so if you<br>
wanted to illuminate the whole face, you'd need collector area equal to<br>
3 times the 10.8 billion square meters of lunar surface you wished to<br>
illuminate. A daunting task. Of course, you could simply build a<br>
reflector system, or possibly a fresnel lense system of equal area which<br>
would orbit in retrograde around the moon in a period eaual to the lunar<br>
28 day cycle around the earth, so it would always be between the moon<br>
and the sun, and you could use the suns illumination of the moon to<br>
illuminate a "slide" of the graphic motif you wished to project onto its<br>
surface. By being of equal area as the lunar cross section, you would<br>
get a neat eclipse effect which would illuminate a circular frame around<br>
the edge of the moon, which would aid people in spotting this aetheral<br>
sign. Damn, I like the fresnel idea, I wonder if the the the counter<br>
periodic lunar orbit is possible?<br>
<p>
Lessee, a 1/6th gravity equates to a 1/6th orbital velocity, or<br>
approximately 3000 mph or less. Using a 28 day period, that equals an<br>
orbital circumference of 2,016,000 miles, which is an altitude of 800<br>
miles? My orbital velocity must be off, as the 17,800 mph for earth is<br>
assuming an earth diameter planet to avoid. HMMMMM Given lunar GM equals<br>
.0049, and a period of 2419200 seconds, to find the orbital velocity at<br>
a 28 day period, we need the cube root of 0.0307876 / 2419200. To<br>
calculate orbital radius from the moons center (remember its surface is<br>
at approximately 750 miles), you need the cube root of 726408010.2949 to<br>
get it in km x 10^2, which should be approximately 90,000 km out. <br>
Given this, the projector station would be able to project an image<br>
across the entire surface  with a 28 day period in a retrograde orbit<br>
about the moon. Of course, being almost 40% of the distance to the earth<br>
at periapsis would have some significant tidal effects on the structure,<br>
which could be countered with either solar wind, magsail, or ion thrust<br>
(or Lorrey Drive) augmentation. If you were not in a retrograde orbit,<br>
you would be in the Lagrange point between the Earth and Moon.<br>
<p>
Of course if you came up with a novel energy source, you could have a<br>
relativley small laser projeciton station that could pump to your hearts<br>
content. Lessee, a singularity would be a decent source of power for<br>
such an endeavor, which would also be usefull for generating antimatter<br>
for spacecraft fuel, and being at the L1 lagrange point would be the<br>
optimum place to have a fuel station anyhow. So lets key in a<br>
singularity as a key economic asset for any lunar economy. The L1 point<br>
would be the prime way point for any  trade in this solar system, given<br>
its advantageous position between the moon and earth.<br>
<p>
Here's a twist on that idea: Suppose you develop a good sized lunar<br>
colony system, and have a hundred million people on the moon, at least.<br>
You could use lasers to trigger aurora effects on earth to create neon<br>
signs visible to lunar inhabitants. how much do you think the nuts on<br>
earth would howl at that concept? Given this, L1 station will become the<br>
Madison Avenue of the 21st century. It will be come THE hot piece of<br>
commercial real estate. Unfortunately, with toroidal habitat structures,<br>
there would be no hope of getting a corner office! ;( AWWWWWW!<br>
