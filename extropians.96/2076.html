&lt;Snip of an excellent poem&gt;<br>

FOR NADIA (AND ALL ELSE, OF COURSE):<br>
<p>
<p>
When I opened my new eyes<br>
On that cool August day<br>
I had no idea<br>
What the doctors would say<br>
<p>
As my senses all came to<br>
I realized where I was<br>
And with my new mouth I began to smile<br>
For no reason except because...<br>
<p>
I was alive!<br>
And that was great!<br>
I had fulfilled<br>
My chosen fate!<br>
I would live<br>
A longer time<br>
'Cause of this<br>
Frozen paradigm<br>
I was preserved<br>
Cryonically<br>
Thanks to Alcor<br>
Industry<br>
And so I'll have<br>
Many more days<br>
To see the world<br>
And change its ways<br>
<p>
So now I get to live my life<br>
But I'll always wonder why<br>
If I can extend my life<br>
Why will so few others try?<br>
<p>
