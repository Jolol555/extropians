The following is a letter I wrote to Omni Magazine.  It was printed in <br>
the magazine (in garbled form) in 1979. <br>
<p>
-------<br>
<p>
In the January interview, I. J. Good proposes that we create a computer <br>
more intelligent than a man, which would then be programmed to <br>
design a still more intelligent computer, and so on.  <br>
<p>
A computer's intelligence is determined primarily by its software.  <br>
Producing a more intelligent computer means devising new languages <br>
and programs.  The nature of the hardware is not critical, although <br>
a computer with human intelligence would presumably need <br>
a memory capacity comparable to the human brain.    <br>
<p>
The hardware would not even have to be electronic.  The human brain <br>
itself could be used instead of a computer.  <br>
<p>
If we can produce software that would make a computer more <br>
intelligent than a man, we might as well produce better software <br>
for ourselves and thus create a _man_ more intelligent than any man is <br>
at present.  These first ultra-intelligent men (and women) could then <br>
carry on the work, just as the ultra-intelligent computer is supposed <br>
to do in Dr. Good's scenario.  <br>
<p>
Anyone who would like to participate in such a project is invited to <br>
write to The Bootstrap Society, [address long since defunct].  <br>
<p>
-------<br>
<p>
The editor changed "a memory capacity comparable to the human brain" <br>
to "a memory capacity incomparable with that of the human brain."  <br>
Why??  This nonsensical expression probably scared off the very people <br>
I hoped to reach.<br>
<p>
The replies I received were not interesting.  I didn't pursue the project <br>
at that time.  <br>
<p>
This will be my last post of the summer.  Vacation starts tomorrow.  <br>
Please don't send me e-mail about this (or anything) right now.  <br>
I don't know how long Delphi saves unread mail.  I will be back online <br>
in the fall.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
