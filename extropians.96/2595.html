<i>&gt;&gt; Some people will not choose to help themselves no matter what you give them</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to make things equal.  Equality is not a stable state if people choose to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; work harder than other people.  Soon they gain the fruits of their labor and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; everything is unequal again (poorer vs. richer).  If one person learns more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than the next. . . you no longer have intellectual equality (educated vs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; uneducated).   China tried this and the educated scientists cleaned toilets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Did the uneducated make a new scientific discoveries?  You should not force</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; equality anymore than you force people to do anything else.  China had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; disaster when they tried. They chose to stop the "inequality" of intellect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Ironically they got an _Atlas Shrugged_Ayn Rand disaster of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; making.      </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But everybody should have the same opportunity. I would like everybody to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have the same chances offered to them to be rich as anybody else. If they</i><br>
<i>&gt;refuse it, fine, but they should have the chance. Yes, having scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt;clean toilets exclusively is bad, but rotating the menial jobs about, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;the scientist has to clean a toilet a week, isn't.  </i><br>
<p>
Everybody already has the opportunity.  Admittedly, not everyone has the<br>
*same* opportunity as everyone else, but it is about time that you accept<br>
that LIFE IS NOT FAIR.  No amount of anything will ever make life fair for<br>
everyone.  Cream always has a way of rising to the top.  To say otherwise is<br>
to say that all people are absolutely identical.<br>
<p>
Why should scientists clean toilets?  They weren't born scientists.  They<br>
got there via a long and arduous path where they may have cleaned many<br>
toilets along the way.  Not having to clean toilets is their reward for all<br>
the work and suffering the endured in getting to be a scientist.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Equality is not the answer.  It's too unstable.  The minute everything is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; equal, things change and the society spontaneously drifts out of that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; unstable state.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, rigid equality is grotesque. I just picture Zamyatin's We. What I</i><br>
<i>&gt;want is equal opportunity. This isn't offered in capitalism because the</i><br>
<i>&gt;capital is held by others, who wouldn't  give it to you because they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;like you. Your idea may be profitable and great, but if you speak up</i><br>
<i>&gt;against those who finance these things, you'll go down. </i><br>
<p>
If your idea is really that great and profitable, you will find capitalist<br>
who will support it.  If not, then maybe the "greatness" and "profitability"<br>
is in your own mind.  <br>
<p>
Having capital does not equate to equal opportunity.  Many great businesses<br>
have started using a technique called "bootstrapping" which has very little<br>
capital requirements.  Sure, you have to work a little harder for your money<br>
initially, but in the long run, you are better off because you are in full<br>
control.  Getting capital from capitalists puts part of your idea and<br>
business under someone else's control.  It is not a case of something for<br>
nothing.<br>
<p>
As I said above, opportunity exists for anyone will to put forth the effort<br>
to take advantage of it.  My own life is a case in point.  I moved to the<br>
Silicon Valley five years ago with $7 dollars to my name and a high school<br>
diploma.  I am now college educated, run my own business, and am extremely<br>
successful financially.  I got there because I work 70-80 hours a week and<br>
am goal oriented.  I strongly believe that anyone who really wants to<br>
succeed can if they are willing to work hard enough.  <br>
<p>
Having capital is useless if you don't have the ambition to take advantage<br>
of it.  And if you have enough ambition and will, free capital is<br>
unnecessary.  I know many successful entrepreneurs and the common factor<br>
among them is they work very hard and they make things happen instead of<br>
waiting for things to happen to them.  Very rarely do people succeed simply<br>
because they have capital.<br>
