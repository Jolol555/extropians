&lt;&lt; I am amazed that some seemingly rational minds are even persuaded by <br>
 something as thoroughly disproven as colloidial silver. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Colloidal silver is bacteriostatic in relatively low concentration and is<br>
widely used for the treatment of disease of mucous membranes and eyes, ref.<br>
 _Nurses Drug Guide 1995_ by Wilson, Shannon and Strang.  Argyrol S.S.<br>
colloidal silver is an FDA NDA approved drug.   <br>
 <br>
I think what you may be objecting to is the claims that it can be efficacious<br>
for prophylaxis of upper respiratory diseases e.g., rhinoviruses such as the<br>
common cold virus.  What studies are you speaking of? . . .  disprove it for<br>
what?  Can you give an example?  What I would like to know is what is it<br>
disproven _for_?  i.e. What medical end point and in what clinical trial?   <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; If it really <br>
 worked--if one single responsible peer-reviewed study proved that it <br>
 did something useful--&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
That's not 100% true.  It _is_ used as a topical antiinfective and is active<br>
against gram negative and gram positive bacteria.  It is used for<br>
preoperative eye surgery and mild inflammatory conditions.  It is also use to<br>
cover burns to reduce the probability of infection.  This is well<br>
established.    <br>
 <br>
For instance, colloidal silver passes the FDA required USP 23 &lt;51&gt;<br>
antimicrobial efficacy test for _Staphylococcus_ aureus_,<br>
_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_, _Escherichia_coli_, _Candida_albicans_, and<br>
_Aspergillus_niger_.  <br>
 <br>
In general silver compounds are widely used as antiinfectives.  There are two<br>
types of silvers: soluble silver salts (highly ionized) and colloidal silvers<br>
(very low ionization).   <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;it would be all over every paper in the nation, <br>
 and any doctor would be crazy not to take advantage of it.  HMOs would <br>
 dump the expensive stuff from their formularies in a minute if it was <br>
 cheaper and as effective.&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
After the validation studies to get ANDA or NDA FDA approval, it may NOT be<br>
less expensive. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  But the plain facts are that it's a fraud.&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Be careful here.  A lot of things that _work_ may not be _proven_ because<br>
companies can't invest the money to get NDA FDA  approval.  Colloidal silver<br>
is probably not patentable as such, so the incentive is less for NDA approval<br>
at this point in time.  This may change because of an increase in antibiotic<br>
drug resistance.   <br>
 <br>
Still,  the colloidal silver (trade named): Argyrol S.S _is_ an NDA FDA<br>
approved drug.  The FDA does _not_ think Argyrol S.S. is a fraud. <br>
 <br>
It's an over statement to say colloidal silver is good for absolutely nothing<br>
or that it is a total fraud.   <br>
 <br>
Probably what you (and I) object to are the claims that "by mouth"<br>
_prophylactic_ use is efficacious.  _Topical_ prophylaxis has been NDA FDA<br>
approved. <br>
 <br>
BTW,  conventional doctors use colloidal silver instead of the more common<br>
silver nitrate (was used to kill gonococcus in eyes of babies<br>
prophylactically), silver lactate, silver picrate and silver sulfadiazine<br>
because colloidal silver is not as irritating to human tissues. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;Spare me the personal story, I'm not interested.  Show me proof. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Look up the NDA for Argyrol S.S.  Also, look in _The Pharmaceutical Basis for<br>
Therapeutics by Goodman and Gilman (send me your snail mail address and I<br>
will send the pages 956, the systemic effects of silver and pages 1039-1041<br>
the local medical uses of silver, to you).   <br>
 <br>
Colloidal silver _was_ USP official also, but since the advent of<br>
antibiotics, has fallen out of favor.   That's why so many of the references<br>
are old.  But, that doesn't invalidate them simply because they are old.  <br>
 <br>
With more and more antibiotic resistance organisms, I expect someone to pay<br>
the money and try to validate to FDA's NDA  satisfaction for some defined<br>
clinical end point, probably some disease of the eyes, ears, nose, throat,<br>
stomach or mucous membranes. <br>
 <br>
Prophylactic use may be more harmful than good and has not been proven to be<br>
effective for say, the common cold. Argyria is caused by the indescriminant<br>
use of silver.   <br>
