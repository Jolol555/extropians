Perhaps commerce is the natural metaphor for relationships with<br>
human beings from outside one's immediate local culture. Considering<br>
the unsavory nature of most of the metaphors that many people in<br>
the world still resort to for their exorelationships, perhaps<br>
propagating the "commerce is natural" meme would be a big step<br>
forward.<br>
<p>
Of course, if you only hang out with fully-enlightened people, it<br>
would be (possibly) a step backward. But if you only hang out with<br>
enlightened people, then you *are* alienated from the human race.<br>
No one is born enlightened.<br>
<p>
Pushing the idea that your natural relationship with all the billions<br>
of people in the world that you do not and cannot know is commercial<br>
says nothing about your relationships with the people that you can<br>
and do know. Obviously those can be much more flexible and deeper.<br>
If you honestly wish to relate to your closest friends and relatives<br>
only on the same terms that you could relate to a stranger from<br>
Uruguay, then I think you're robbing yourself of opportunities for<br>
satisfying relationships with other human beings.<br>
