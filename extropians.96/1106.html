<p>
Eugene, I appreciate your sentiments, but I really don't think this <br>
stance makes any more sense to me than the objectivists' stance. <br>
Maximizing happiness sounds like maximizing complexity to me; an effort <br>
to maximize something that we have *no* clue how to *measure* is just a <br>
metaphor, and exactly as misleading as some of the metaphors that the <br>
Objectivists have recourse to.<br>
<p>
(If anyone figures out how to measure these things, or how to measure <br>
life or extropy for that matter, please let me know.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is objective reality? How can I learn anything about it, but through </i><br>
<i>&gt; my senses, and augmentary senses (gadgets), which translate things </i><br>
<i>&gt; outside my sphere of experience into a language I can understand. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Plato's cave. Is there an outside? That we _feel_ there is something out </i><br>
<i>&gt; there is but the artefact of the process by which we are generated: the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Darwinian evolution. </i><br>
<p>
Now, this I also find curious because Darwinian evolution is in itself <br>
our best argument for believing in objective reality. Darwinian evolution <br>
is the explanation that each of us has recourse to when accounting for <br>
how our individual minds came into existence. Of course there is an <br>
outside; if there weren't, then our own existence as individuals would be <br>
a puzzling lacuna in the explanatory structure of our thought. If there <br>
weren't an outside, we'd be able to explain all our percepts in terms of <br>
our own activity, but we would lack any explanation for our own activity.<br>
<p>
The definition that I am currently experimenting with: objective <br>
reality is that part of reality which is the way it is independently of <br>
the influence of any individual person's mind. By a strong construction <br>
of this definition, only offplanet things are "objective reality" by now. <br>
Certainly most of the objects surrounding you, the monitor you are <br>
reading, etc, are not independent of the causal influence of mind and <br>
thought. One might say that technology is the admixture of subjective <br>
reality (thought and feeling) with objective reality (that which is <br>
independent of thought and feeling). Some people seem to think that what <br>
we are all trying to do here is to bring subjective reality into thorough <br>
admixture with the rest of the poor dead "objective reality" universe.<br>
<p>
However, I must insist that I still do not think the objective/subjective <br>
dichotomy is a very useful one philosophically. It's a good thing to get <br>
exhausted thinking about, if you need that kind of exercise, but it tells <br>
us practically nothing about what we ought to be doing, and isn't that <br>
the point?<br>
<p>
So I suppose I'm actually agreeing with Eugene. He seems to think that <br>
there is no point to elaborating the objective/subjective boundary, and <br>
I'm inclined to agree with him. But to deny the existence of this <br>
boundary, or to deny the existence of that objective reality that <br>
explains our individual existences just closes up the minds of most <br>
people who might otherwise have been listening to you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Knowledge: a bag of tricks. Ethics: cooperation emergence due to </i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution pressure. Deterministic as hell.</i><br>
<p>
Determinism/indeterminism is another one of these questions that I don't <br>
like to see my friends taking sides on. This is an open question! It may <br>
be decades, centuries, or thousands of years before we have an answer to <br>
this question (and I'd be willing to settle for a proof that an "answer" <br>
is impossible), but it is certainly an open question right now.<br>
<p>
How could a computer fully predict the future course of its own <br>
computation in a manner that we could usefully distinguish from its mere <br>
carrying out of that computation? It could not. If I could prove that it <br>
could not, then I would have proved that the determinism/indeterminism <br>
question is a permanently open one, at least to the satisfaction of those <br>
few people who think that human beings are a kind of computer. I suspect <br>
Eugene is one of them. Me, I like to keep an open mind, although it gets <br>
harder every year.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, I'll be looking into more Popper. He was obviously <br>
fascinated by this question, and I haven't read everything he had to say <br>
about it yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I dunno... Going for the right goals, but for wrong reasons? What's wrong </i><br>
<i>&gt; with that? These objectivists are certainly not utilitarists. But they </i><br>
<i>&gt; are certainly irrational.</i><br>
<p>
Utilitarianism is irrational too. Most of the people that "utilitarian<br>
libertarians" look to for guidance in difficult political questions (I<br>
have in mind David Friedman here) deny that they are utilitarians, and for<br>
damn good reason: David Friedman is *not* a utilitarian, and neither am I.<br>
Unless "utilitarian" suddenly means something utterly different from the<br>
very clear technical meaning that was established at the climax of<br>
utilitarian thought in late nineteenth-century Britain.  Frankly, of late<br>
I like Hayek's thinking best, and he's certainly no utilitarian either.<br>
Nor is he an objectivist, though I think Rand approved of him. If<br>
objectivists want to criticize libertarians, that's okay with me (though I<br>
really wonder about their motivation), but if they seek to criticize<br>
libertarians on the grounds that libertarians are utilitarians, then they<br>
are attacking straw men... a time-honored Objectivist recreation, I'm<br>
afraid. <br>
<p>
I suspect what makes them *really* nervous is that so many libertarians<br>
are vague Taoists or Discordians who, while continuing to keep their<br>
intellectual tools for thinking about philosophy sharp, have utterly<br>
abandoned any and all philosophical *commitments*. And who feel happier<br>
that way. And whose valuable political commitments aren't even slightly<br>
harmed by such lack of philosophical commitment. But most seriously<br>
committed Objectivists I've known don't even know how to begin arguing<br>
against this stance by any means other than the ad hominem. I would be<br>
very interested in seeing some clear, calm, rational arguments against<br>
this stance. <br>
<p>
(I'd also be interested in seeing a solid refutation of Hayek, too, but <br>
I'm not getting my hopes up or anything.)<br>
