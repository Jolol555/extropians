Chris said:<br>
All this points to EQ I suppose. Emotion is mere entertainment from my<br>
viewpoint. Emotion comes from the ancient reptilian brain deep within your<br>
cranium where logic is fresh and new and one of the higher forms of thought<br>
to help us rationalize and use tools. Why deny the fact that emotion is<br>
vistigial (sp?) and only for mere entertainment now that we have logic?<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
Do you always buy Release 1.0, too? :) It's new, it *must* be better!<br>
<p>
Emotion may be considered primitive; HOWEVER, I don't find it <br>
"vestigial" in the slightest.<br>
<p>
I'd argue that all "motivation", the kind that actually gets you out <br>
of  bed in the morning, bent on doing something other than <br>
elimination or(perhaps) eating,  is emotional/chemical at root. <br>
<p>
Gedanken time: Eliminate dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine and <br>
norepinephrine from my system, them take out all the endocrine <br>
substances that are not currently known to act as neurotransmitters<br>
--I doubt that I'd feel like doing anything at all, even think.<br>
<p>
Logic is *useful*--SOMETIMES.  Emotions are *fun*--SOMETIMES.<br>
Are emotions ever useful? Is logic ever fun? Hmm--I'd say yes. Hmmmm.<br>
<p>
To say that logic is a completely satisfactory substitute for emotion is <br>
akin to saying that molybdenum grease is a completely satisfactory <br>
substitute for ice cream. They have similar viscosity, right?<br>
