Uh Oh - I was afraid that I'd bitten off a little too much with that<br>
post!<br>
<p>
I warned that I had not studied Rosen. I believe his point is that<br>
mechanical models of physics do not allow systems to act in an<br>
anticipatory fashion, something that some believe to be the case in<br>
living organisms, while others might argue that it is simply a matter of<br>
mechanical natural selection.  As for what Rosen means by "much else<br>
besides" organic phenomena, I haven't a clue at this point.<br>
<p>
That's a poor response so I guess I'll have to get and read Rosen's<br>
latest book:"Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature,<br>
Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Here's one review of it:<br>
"Book News, Inc., 02/01/92: In a sophisticated (but clear and<br>
understandable) exposition, Rosen (physiology and biophysics, Dalhousie<br>
U.) rejects both the necessity and the sufficiency of the mechanistic<br>
model/metaphor for biological life, and proposes an alternative, drawn<br>
equally from experience in biology, physics, and mathematics. Annotation<br>

<i>&gt;And where does Tipler rely on modelling complex systems as Markov</i><br>
<i>&gt;processes? His main arguments about the Eternal Return and the Bekenstein</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bound applies to just about any system; even if the system does it best</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be unpredictable or organized it *has to* repeat itself in a finite</i><br>
<i>&gt;time if it is finite and non-growing. Markov processes are awfully general.</i><br>
<p>
You are probably correct that Tipler does not rely on Markov processes<br>
in his arguments.  The following is my *very* _naive_ interpretation of<br>
this from a fragment of some notes I took after reading "The Physics of<br>
Immortality".  I think I was using Markov processes as a proxy for the<br>
even more general idea of determinism.<br>
<p>
10/31/94. I submit that most real-world processes do not evolve as<br>
Markov chains because state Xi+1 is NOT dependent ONLY on the state the<br>
system is in at state Xi. Random inputs from the environment during the<br>
transition to state Xi+1 can cause the next state to be quite<br>
discontinuous from state Xi. For example, a machine normally wears down<br>
in a manner consistent with a Markov process; but, accidents can happen<br>
at any point and thus break the chain. Of course, in this case, the<br>
probability of an accident could be incorporated into the calculation of<br>
the transition probabilities. However, in the case of living systems<br>
that are also actively seeking new inputs as well as encountering them<br>
by chance, the assumption of stationary transition probabilities seems<br>
absurd.<br>
<p>
We are not Markov chains because we have memory AND we can plan ahead.<br>
In other words, in addition to accidents and active seeking of<br>
alternatives, we also are able to apply past states (experience) to<br>
current situations. The teleology of being nostalgic and goal-directed<br>
violates the first-order Markovian property of finite-state systems.<br>
What this means is that, yes, we may go along for a while, stuck in a<br>
rut so to speak, advancing step by step according to stationary<br>
transition probabilities; but, we are also able to suddenly recall a<br>
previous, perhaps long-ago state, that somehow seems relevant to our<br>
current situation, and we make a 'quantum leap', an attitude adjustment.<br>
In short, Tipler's basic assumption that humans are finite-state<br>
machines and, therefore, can be simulated, by brute force in the<br>
all-powerful future, is irrelevant.  Even if A SINGLE entity can be IN<br>
only a finite number of states, this does not mean that there are ONLY a<br>
finite number of TOTAL states that an entity can choose from.<br>
<p>
While acknowledging free will and the randomness of experience, Tipler<br>
seems to imply that, in the long run, none of these idiosyncracies<br>
matter because we will settle into a 'pattern'. It is the common<br>
patterns, not the individual peculiarities, which are 'immortal', which<br>
will be resurrected by the Omega Point.  All flaws will be removed in<br>
the 'heaven' of the Omega Point, except perhaps as isolated, static<br>
perversions available only for pious reflection and academic reference,<br>
but not allowed to exist in practice.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Some recent posts have claimed that the universe is compressible because</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it contains so much space, ignoring that this 'space' is far from empty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; being filled with sundry species of cosmic rays and 'vital' dust</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (archives of the universe?)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is the evidence that vacuum is not a state of near maximal entropy?</i><br>
<i>&gt;(One vacuum with virtual particles looks like any other vacuum -&gt; *very*</i><br>
<i>&gt;high entropy)</i><br>
<p>
Vacuum: 1. emptiness of space, 2. a space absolutely devoid of matter<br>
(or voided of matter to the highest degree possible).<br>
<p>
I think you are correct that vacuum is "in a state of near maximal<br>
entropy."  I am saying that space cannot be considered a mere vacuum, it<br>
must be seen as a communications medium, even a cyberspace, for<br>
electromagnetic energy (not to mention gravity).  As far as cosmic rays<br>
&amp; 'vital' dust being the 'archives of the universe', that was pretty<br>
much wild speculation on my part.  However, these cosmic rays and dust<br>
do contain reams of information about the past cosmos.  Perhaps space<br>
could be compressed, if that wouldn't impact its ability to transmit<br>
information or allow material processes to occur.  One of the things I<br>
criticized about the Strong Nanotech posts (as Dan Clemmensen wrote on<br>
9/22/96 : "With MNT, all I need to produce an item is the design for the<br>
item, and matter, and energy.") was that they assumed no need for<br>
'geospace' or other infrastructure.<br>
<p>
Also, Taoists and others are fond of telling us to study the spaces<br>
between things (the relationships) rather than just the things<br>
themselves.<br>
