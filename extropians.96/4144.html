<i>&gt;It seems, MMX multimedia instructions performance is distinctly inferior</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  I think MMX is an excuse to have mediocre floating point<br>
performance.  I have always had reservations about specialty, high-level<br>
instructions on a CPU.  But then again, Intel has been doing this since the<br>
i860 (which they are finally retiring).  PowerPC has a solid floating point<br>
architecture borrowed from IBMs Power 2 series, which also offered superb<br>
floating point performance.<br>
<p>
I think the P6 is Intel's first x86 CPU with adequate (although modest)<br>
floating point performance.  If I was going to do serious floating point<br>
number crunching though, I would definitely go with PA-RISC, Alpha, or<br>
PowerPC architectures.  I think as Intel's architectures get faster, they<br>
are going to find it harder and harder to sell their chips if they don't<br>
seriously upgrade their floating point hardware.  Fabulous integer<br>
performance isn't enough for most high-end, computation heavy software,<br>
especially in the realm of multimedia where you have a lot of realtime<br>
signal processing and transforms.<br>
