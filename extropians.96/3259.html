BIG SMILE AT LYLE<br>
<p>
I was not telling you ABOUT sexism, I was commenting on your yours, at that<br>
moment. If you must know I am not politically correct at all.  <br>
<p>
Who said I wanted to have sex with those pretty people? I was talking about<br>
eating food with them and enjoying looking at them...<br>
<p>
Asethetics are my cup of tea, FYI<br>
<p>
I certainly wouldnt require payment in sexual favors at the end of the<br>
night...  the meal then *wouldnt* be free, now would it?<br>
<p>
( Oh, and... BTW- What does being pretty have to do with sex? Ugly people are<br>
good at sex too... at least some are. They may even enjoy it, who knows? ; -<br>
) <br>
<p>
<p>
THis iS More BaBbLe, IMHO<br>
