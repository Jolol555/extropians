<i>&gt; I am sorry for such a basic question, but I am writing a short paper </i><br>

<i>&gt; Could someone point me in the right direction.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure how basic your question is.  Going back to the very <br>
beginning, there are two references you should read:  <br>
<p>
Conrad Schneiker, "Nanotechnology with Feynman Machines:  <br>
Scanning Tunneling Engineering and Artificial Life."  This appears in <br>
*Artificial Life*, edited by Christopher Langton, page 443.  This is the <br>
only article I know of that gives the full history of nanotechnology, <br>
from a non-Drexlerian viewpoint.  <br>
<p>
Eric Drexler, *Engines of Creation* -- the standard work that made <br>
nanotechnology famous.  <br>
<p>
Now, assuming you have read these references, you want someone to <br>
point you in the right direction.  I'm not sure how much I can say <br>
about this without writing the paper for you, but here are some points to <br>
consider:  <br>
<p>
1.  Make distinctions.  Instead of using a catch-all term like <br>
"nanotechnology," use more specific terms such as "molecular <br>
manufacturing" or "strong AI."  <br>
<p>
2.  Put everything into an economic context.  When somebody claims <br>
that goods produced by molecular manufacturing will be free, ask:  <br>
why are things not free now?  Many items are already produced by <br>
replicators that operate at the atomic level (plants and animals).  <br>
Oranges, for example, grow on trees:  why are oranges not free?  <br>
<p>
As Robin Hanson said in a recent post, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think folks are too stuck on the notion that changes must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomprehensible - you don't know what you can or can't understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; until you try.  And you haven't really tried until you've used the</i><br>
<i>&gt; best intellectual tools available.</i><br>
<p>
And you can start with very simple tools.  <br>
<p>
3.  Be skeptical.  Ask irreverent questions.  When Ralph Merkle says <br>
diamondoid material will be as cheap as potatoes, ask:  why potatoes?  <br>
Why not silk, ivory, mahogany wood, orchids, or caviar?  Products <br>
made atom by atom in a replicating system may be very expensive.     <br>
<p>
3.  Put nanotechnology into a historical context.  The economy has been <br>
getting more and more automated for a long time; we use more and <br>
more artificial materials; agriculture has given way to agribusiness; <br>
manufacturing is getting more and more fine-grained.  Will nanotech be <br>
a qualitative change, or just more of the same?  If someone claims that <br>
the change will be qualitative, what exactly does that claim depend on?  <br>
In other words, what assumptions are being made?  <br>
<p>
How does molecular manufacturing differ from agribusiness or <br>
forestry?  If it does become possible to make things out of diamondoid <br>
materials, will this change our situation in any essential way?   <br>
<p>
4.  Calibrate your ideas.  In other words, when somebody claims that <br>
something will happen, look at an analogous case.  For example, strong <br>
AI is going to be available by 2020, according to the nanotechnologists.  <br>
To calibrate this idea, consider how long it takes to write other kinds of <br>
software, such as an operating system.  Will version 8.0 of the Mac OS <br>
(Copland) be ready by 2020?  How can anyone say that the human mind <br>
will be ready to shrink-wrap in that time frame?  <br>
<p>
5. Consider carefully the idea of the "assembler breakthrough."  <br>
Eric Drexler describes it as follows (Engines of Creation, Chapter 5, <br>
pages 80-81)  --  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At some point, full-fledged automated engineering systems will </i><br>
<i>&gt; pull ahead on their own.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In parallel, molecular technology will develop and mature, aided by </i><br>
<i>&gt; advances in automated engineering... The rate of technological </i><br>
<i>&gt; advance will then quicken to a great upward leap:  in a brief time, </i><br>
<i>&gt; many areas of technology will advance to the limits set by natural </i><br>
<i>&gt; law...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This transformation is a dizzying prospect.  Beyond it, if we survive, </i><br>
<i>&gt; lies a world with replicating assemblers, able to make whatever they </i><br>
<i>&gt; are told to make, without need for human labor...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If given a charge of energy, materials, and assemblers, such a system </i><br>
<i>&gt; might aptly be called a 'genie machine.'  What you ask for, it will </i><br>
<i>&gt; produce.  </i><br>
<p>
This  dizzying prospect  is what gives the book its explosive quality.  <br>
But does it make sense?  What does he mean, "without need for <br>
human labor"?  What would a genie machine look like?  <br>
<p>
If a genie machine is defined as an entity that can make anything -- <br>
whatever it is told to make -- does a genie machine already exist?  <br>
I would say yes:  the economy as a whole is a genie machine.  Now, <br>
could anything smaller than the entire economy make *anything*?  <br>
<p>
This should be enough to point you in the right direction.  <br>
