I was just considering the several dangers facing highly intelligent life on <br>
this planet.  Collision with a large asteroid, organized terrorists setting <br>
off nuclear bombs all over the world,  a deadly and highly contagious strain <br>
of bacteria, etc.  I was also considering how robust life in general is on <br>
this planet and how it would pretty much take the sun going nova to destroy it <br>
all.  There are living organisms several kilometers deep in the earth's crust, <br>
and it would take something very catastrophic to destroy it all.  However, at <br>
one time, life wasn't so widespread and robust on earth, and it seems <br>
conceivable that it could have been destroyed much easier then, but at some <br>
point, life became so widespread and robust that only a highly catastrophic <br>
event could destroy all of it.  This point I am calling the "point of no <br>
return" for life itself.  What I am wondering about is if there is such a <br>
"point of no return" for advanced intelligent life, such as ourselves.  Is <br>
there a level of advancement beyond which highly intelligent life is <br>
impossible to destroy?  Right now, we are vulnerable.  Can we ever move beyond <br>
that?  Is such a state of invincibility even possible?<br>
<p>
Just something to think about...<br>
