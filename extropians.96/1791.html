Thanks to Forrest Bishop for putting some thought into what David Brin<br>
calls the "Berserker" question.<br>
 <br>
[[I though Berserkers were stray military machines, like the Borg, that<br>
simply destroyed because it was their programmming.]]<br>
<p>
 The possibility that there is lots of<br>
life all around, all trying to play dead to avoid retribution, is very<br>
popular among the very best hard science fiction authors, including<br>
Brin, Benford, and Bear.  <br>
[[Oh. Haven't been reading much SF in recent years. ]]<br>
<p>
It is well worth more attention than I gave<br>
it in my Great Filter paper.  (Btw, I extracted the bio part of that<br>
article, made it more formal, and just submitted it to Science.  See:<br>
<a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/hardsteps.ps">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/hardsteps.ps</a>)<br>
[[Congratulations! Think they're wired enough to print it?]]<br>
<p>
In fact, it would be great fun, and worth doing intellectually, to run<br>
a game-theoretic simulation of this problem. <br>
[[I agree. I do hope the "low profile"  scenario is incorrect. It<br>
would be conducive to hope about the future to provide a studied<br>
counter example. If the "low profile", or "Berserker" situation is true, one<br>
should realize that our descendents _are_ the Berserkers.<br>
<p>
 Could get an Icarus<br>
publication out of it.  Any worthy coauthors interested? :-)<br>
[[Interested, yes.]]<br>
<p>
Let me try to sketch out the strategic situation here.<br>
<p>
A new civilization like ours knows that a shell of our early radio<br>
signals is expanding out at the speed of light, and that this may<br>
trigger "berserker" probes flying in at near the speed of light to<br>
destroy our solar system.  So some folks may want to get the hell out<br>
of here and try to colonize elsewhere.<br>
<p>
[[Two cases here:<br>
1) We've intercepted their radio signals.<br>
2) We haven't, and are paranoid.<br>
<p>
Case 1): We either launch a preemptive strike, or send "welcome space brother" noises<br>
in their direction. We simultaneously beat feet in the opposite direction.<br>
<p>
Case 2): For the case of not knowing the direction of an imagined attack, one direction<br>
is as good as the next. We expand in a rough sphere, always preceeded by our past radio shell.<br>
<p>
Some complications:<br>
Interstellar media variations put speed limits on starships. We are currently in the <br>
interesting position of being between two interstellar gas clouds. Our Solar System<br>
will enter a gas cloud in about 50000 (?) years, at which time interstellar travel may<br>
have to slow down. One open question: do we use big fat starships or wee little <br>
nanoprobes?<br>
Our current radio signals may only be perceptible for a few thousand light years, before<br>
being lost in the background.]]<br>
<p>
  They'd want to go as fast as<br>
possible, to escape a possible detonation wave of unknown size and<br>
speed<br>
<p>
[[A putative speed of light spherical pulse of some kind is the nastiest <br>
possibility. It would eventualy catch any material object.]]<br>
<p>
 (could someone nova our star, or galactic center?), <br>
<p>
[[Yes. Consider a type of nova event, wherein a White Dwarf (a burned out<br>
 star with the mass of the Sun and diameter of the Earth) slowly accumulates<br>
 a hydrogen atmosphere on its surface. At some point, the temperature and <br>
density of this atmosphere becomes high enough to sustain fusion. The <br>
interesting part about this is that the fusioning is initiated at a _single region_<br>
near the surface of the White Dwarf, then spreads horizontally to encircle the<br>
globe, as well as vertically up through the hydrogen column as far as conditions<br>
will permit hydrgen burning.<br>
This is essentially a big hydrogen bomb, set off by a teensy trigger (a <br>
catastrophy event).<br>
Now consider an average, ho-hum star like the Sun. This system is in a delicate <br>
balance between gravitational collapse (implosion), and runaway fusion (explosion)<br>
(we've come to find out the Sun is not a perfectly stable system, BTW). The thermal<br>
and radiation pressure that keeps the Sun from collapsing is generated by continuous<br>
nuclear fusion at or near the core. This core is surrounded by a blanket of mostly <br>
hydrogen, in a very high temperature and density state, in fact, just short of fusion<br>
criticality. An anomalous increase in these parameters may be able to initiate a fusing<br>
blast wave that encircles the core, similar to the White Dwarf scenario. The resulting<br>
sudden energy release would then blow off the outer layers of the Sun, like a nova.<br>
One method of providing this trigger is to fire an object at the Sun, that is large enough<br>
and fast enough to penetrate the outer layers without burning up, and deposit its energy in<br>
the pre-critical region.<br>
 <br>
The case of a supernova chain reaction at the core of the Milky Way Galaxy has been studied<br>
in some detail, and may have already occured a number of times. There is apparently a big<br>
(4 million+ Solar mass) Black Hole at the galactic core that occasionaly gulps down a<br>
stray star or two. The resulting fireworks may have provided the energy input to nearby <br>
(~ light year) densely clustered stars to cause them to nova or supernova, in a sort of chain <br>
reaction. As a result, the Core, out to a radius of 10 or 20 thousand light years, is probably sterile.<br>
 It would behoove us to set up an Early Warning System within a few hundred light years of this<br>
circus.<br>

<p>
or a<br>
followup wave of berserkers.  And they'd also want to not send signals<br>
back to Earth that such enemies might intercept <br>
- signals would have<br>
to look like cosmic background to someone without the right key (and<br>
with the home base keeping your location info very localized, on a<br>
hair trigger to destroy it.) <br>
<p>
[[So you don’t buy the ‘wipe the memory idea’? The basis is that<br>
one cannot be certain of a memory immune from infiltration.]]<br>
<p>
 They'd also want turn a corner<br>
somewhere, so their path away from Earth (ionized regions) doesn't<br>
lead right to them. <br>
<p>
[[Dragging a cable behind the starship while passing near a star provides<br>
a free (no mass or energy expense) course change, via Lorentz Force <br>
interaction with the stellar magnetic field.<br>
<i>]]</i><br>
<p>
 And not knowning how far they might be followed,<br>
they'd want to go a good long way.<br>
<p>
[[Hmmm. An argument for intergalatic travel. One can travel much <br>
faster and with less wake noise between galaxies than through them. ]]<br>
<p>
New colonies might try to hide themselves better, but even then some<br>
of the locals may get itchy of being traced, or growing too big not to<br>
be seen, and try to escape.  Within any system, keeping the quiet is a<br>
public good, so a strong central policing might be required to enforce<br>
it. <br>
<p>
[[If the colony is a merged superinelligence, said policing would simply<br>
be a form of self-discipline.]]<br>
<p>
..Or considering the costs and<br>
risks of strong central policing, they might decide to just run for it<br>
from the very beginning.<br>
<p>
[[Running early is an excellent policy, but suffers the “hare and the <br>
tortoise” problem- that later, more technically advanced probes will<br>
overtake the pioneers. Of course, that presumes there are later probes.]]<br>
<p>
A civilization may also want to try to "test the waters", by sending<br>
one probe to a distant system to try this "running for it" strategy,<br>
and to then watch the results.  They might also try a "loud mouth"<br>
strategy in such a distant system, broadcasting as loud as they can to<br>
see who responds how.  Of course just how far away is "distant" is a<br>
tricky question.<br>
<p>
[[This reminds me of the strategy of some nesting birds. When threatened,<br>
the hen will <br>
move some distance from the nest and then call attention to herself.]]<br>
<p>
The strategic situation of a potential berserker is also <br>
complicated....<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the<br>
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the<br>
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,<br>
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years.<br>
That huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new<br>
technology, so some of your descendants become as advanced as your<br>
advanced enemies.<br>
To verify this intuition, an explicit simulation would be appropriate.<br>
<p>
[[Indeed it would!<br>
