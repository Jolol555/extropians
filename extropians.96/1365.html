<i>                   &gt;The "automated" factories that you speak of are only                </i><br>
<i>                   &gt;automated at one point in the manufacturing process.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
And Nanotechnology without AI would be automated in the manufacturing process <br>
too, that is it could duplicate any existing object. If you have a good <br>
description of an object then you could make another one, and if you don't  <br>
then Nanotechnology can examine the object and get a detailed description.  <br>
Again let me repeat there is no reason to suppose that AI will not come along  <br>
with Nanotechnology, but we can do a lot even without it. <br>
<p>
Engineers have a good description of automobiles, yet as you point out, to <br>
turn that description into a working car takes a lot of intelligent people <br>
that have learned a lot of difficult skills. Exactly what is it about <br>
Nanotechnology  that is so different from conventional manufacturing that it <br>
makes all that unnecessary?  I can think of 6 reasons:<br>
                  <br>
1) The parts a car factory uses are very expensive, the parts that <br>
   Nanotechnology  uses are very cheap.<br>
                  <br>
2) A car factory uses many thousands or millions of different types of parts   <br>
   and you must learn how to operate all of them. At the most, Nanotechnology   <br>
   uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real world almost <br>
   everything we know is made of less than 20, less than 10 parts for life.<br>
                  <br>
3) All the many different parts the factory uses are fragile, and fragile in   <br>
   different ways, you must learn the proper handling techniques for them all   <br>
   or you will destroy the parts before you can use them. There is no way you <br>
   can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.<br>
                  <br>
4) None of the parts the factory uses are absolutely identical. Despite our   <br>
   best efforts, individual variation still exists, and so we must treat them    <br>
   differently and compensate for the variation in the assembly process if we    <br>
   want the finished product to work properly, that often takes intelligence.    <br>
   On the other hand, according to the laws of Physics one hydrogen atom is    <br>
   absolutely identical to another hydrogen atom and can be treated in    <br>
   exactly the same way. Atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.<br>
                  <br>
5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital  <br>
   domain, and I think most of us know the advantage of that. You may have to     <br>
   deal with a rod 27 atoms long, or 28 atoms long, but you never have to     <br>
   worry about a rod  27.5601334 atoms long.<br>
                  <br>
6) Most of the parts a factory uses are very complex and the ways they    <br>
   interact with other parts are even more complex. Think of the windshield    <br>
   of a car, it interacts poorly with the engine block, and even with the  <br>
   windshield frame the interaction must be managed with great skill or you    <br>
   will have a disaster. Nanotechnology is like building with leggo blocks, <br>
   you can build structures of arbitrary complexity, yet there are only a few    <br>
   different types of blocks and they interact with other blocks in only a    <br>
   few different ways. It's easy to develop an algorithm to examine any leggo   <br>
   object and then build a duplicate, it's very far from easy to find an  <br>
   algorithm that would do the same with a car.    <br>
                           <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;There are many points where a decision has to be made by                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;somebody who has an understanding of the project as a whole                 </i><br>
                          <br>
<p>
Then complex things would never get made by humans. No one man, no ten men  <br>
have a deep understanding of an airliner or a microprocessor or the software <br>
that lets it do interesting things, it's too great for one mind to grasp, <br>
at least a mind as puny as a human.  <br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;and who understands the purpose of his activity.                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The purpose of his activity is to make money, but that's even more complex  <br>
than manufacturing because not even a billion men understands the economy  in <br>
any depth.  In spite of our lack of understanding we still manage to build <br>
things.                    <br>
<p>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;John:                        </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;We know for sure that it's possible to manufacture                      </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;extremely complex objects, like human beings</i><br>
                                   <br>
<i>                &gt;Lyle:                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;No.  To "manufacture" something means to make it to a                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;specification. Human beings are not manufactured to spec.   </i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
Depends on how tight the specification is, by some standards one person is <br>
much like another, but if that specification is not tight enough for your  <br>
taste try ants. Every worker ant or bee in a colony (the vast majority) is  <br>
identical to every other  one, and she is more complex than any machine a  <br>
human has ever made, so far. The queen can manufacture hundreds of workers a <br>
day if she receives enough food, and queen ants and bees are very dumb.  <br>
<p>
True, there might be some very tiny variation in workers development, even  <br>
though they have identical genes, but no manufacturing process is perfect and   <br>
2 workers would be far more similar than any 2 cars coming off the same  <br>
assembly line.<br>
