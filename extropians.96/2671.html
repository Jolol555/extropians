<i>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, this assumes that ANYONE should be "in power" Look at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the biggest organisms on the planet- coral reefs, Mangroves, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; underground</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; molds, and hyperthermophilic communities in the earth's crust. The HTP</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; biomass is estimated to exceed 90% of all the living mass on the planet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; None of these has anything like a central authority, yet they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; most successful organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Popular opinion (including mine) has it that _we_ are the most </i><br>
<i>&gt;successful organisms.</i><br>
<p>
Popular opinion, yes but it should be decided by which organism is the most<br>
complex and can manipulate their environment the most.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, you may be right, the way things are going.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I had a talk with my cereal this morning...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The cereal community is really concerened because</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is losing it's rich, diverse texture.. Too many cross breedings of cereals</i><br>
<i>&gt;and grains, combined with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;grinding and blending of different cereals together </i><br>
<i>&gt;are causing the cereals to lose their individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;identities. Their flavor, so to speak.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A new government program is being discussed which</i><br>
<i>&gt;protects the rights of various grains. As cross cereal</i><br>
<i>&gt;issues become more complex, I am sure we will have regulations which ensure</i><br>
<i>&gt;that all cereals are equal.</i><br>
<p>
It really amazes me how it's possible to create such complexity about such<br>
a simple topic. :-)<br>
