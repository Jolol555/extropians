I think you overestimate the need for cold to get machine-phase systems <br>
to work, most likely they will work *better* at low temperatures, but <br>
they would work even at 300 K. The main problem I see is avoiding having <br>
water molecules jamming the devices, Drexler want's a vacuum around his <br>
systems. <br>

<p>
Interesting, and IMHO correct, point. This is the reason I think biotech <br>
will be essential for the development of nanotech. <br>

<p>
What about the microtubuli? They are sturdy, good at self-organization <br>
and if we could figure out how to use the dyneines and kinesines, we <br>
could move molecules along them as we want. If we also could fixate the <br>
tubuli, they might make a good scaffolding. <br>
