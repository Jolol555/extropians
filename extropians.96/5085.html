I remember reading about an article about the creator of the first such<br>
nutrient solution (a Swede, as usual when it comes to medical technology :-)<br>
and he discovered that the cruicial ingredient was egg yolk! The big problem<br>
before him was that fat could not be supplied, it tended to turn into nasty<br>
embolies when added into the bloodstream. Apparently the yolk contains<br>
emulgators able to create suitable microdroplets. Today I guess we could do<br>
it syntethically, but there is probably no economy in it. <br>

Yes, but it is also necessary to spice up things. Great food is a very useful<br>
social tool, since it promotes a relaxed and euphoric mood suitable for<br>
discussion and the development of new ideas. <br>
<p>
Which reminds me: we have to decide on the 'when &amp; where' of the next Omega<br>
dinner. <br>
