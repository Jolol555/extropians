Yes, I'd guess most, if not all extropians and fellow-travellers do.  A<br>
project I've had to shelve for the time being due to the press of making a<br>
living is working out my own thoughts on this subject in sufficient detail to<br>
be subject to decent analysis and criticism.  <br>
<p>
I interpret questions about the "meaning of life" to ultimately be questions<br>
about morality, i.e. what is good or worthwhile.  A "quick and dirty"<br>
statement of the core of my thoughts on this subject is that morality, ethics<br>
and teleology can be derived from epistimology.  (Blech! -- what a sentence!)<br>
 A less cryptic statement of this idea is that a rigorous rational morality<br>
can be derived from the very nature of an entity that is capable of<br>
"knowing", without the need for reference to any source of value outside the<br>
knower and community of knowers.  The irreducible axiom of this concept of<br>
morality is that knowing and "knowers" are fundamental goods.  To the extent<br>
that any rationale for this axiom is possible or necessary, it is that we are<br>
essentially and uniquely knowers.<br>
<p>
As for the original subject of this post, hedonism, it seems to me that<br>
pleasure of all sorts is inextricably intertwined with knowledge -- it is one<br>
of many possible qualities of knowledge.  Being perhaps less analytical and<br>
more common-sensical, shouldn't we simply say that, all other things being<br>
equal, pleasure makes us happy and happiness is a good thing?  This begs the<br>
question of the ethical context of any particular pleasure, but that is a<br>
subject for another day ...<br>
