<i> &gt; Yep. Valid question. This is why decentralization is the key to any  </i><br>
<i> &gt; equitable society. In small scale communities, people can keep tabs  </i><br>
<i> &gt; on each other, done with a feeling of "hey, this hurts people, why </i><br>
<i> &gt; don't you stop it" . </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Some people prefer other than small scale communities, where they <br>
can be free from tab keeping neighbors and family members. These people <br>
form big impersonal cities by joining them. <br>
<p>
In the big market place, people "keep tabs on each other" through <br>
nonpersonal and not privacy invacive mechanisms such as price signals, <br>
which measure the supply of a given resource against the social demand<br>
for that resource. The free market economy and its price signals are <br>
the voice of the people, and the people's market-voice is expressed <br>
without anybody having to keep tabs on any other person but <br>
themselves. It's perfect -- i.e., it works spontaneously.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; if you have any form of centralization, a huge power imbalance occurs, </i><br>
<i> &gt; because the ones in charge can dictate to those not in charge.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: As long as people have private property rights, they are free to <br>
exit potential associations, such as going or not going to McDonald's. <br>
This means that in the free-market-private-property society, the <br>
people -- manifested as the collective consumer speaking through <br>
price signals -- control the economy.<br>
<p>
When we all live on one collective with no property demarcations, we <br>
live in a defacto monopoly. When property is uniform, there is monopoly. <br>
It does not even need to have one person or one central body of people <br>
at the helm. When we equalize outcomes, the social mind-set "norms-out" <br>
toward the lowest common denominator. I'll do as little work as I can <br>
get away with, and try to get others to carry as much of my weight <br>
as possible, for if I work harder to get more rewards, the'll be <br>
taken away for others who worked less. It's so simple to see.<br>
<p>
People do this in the market also, but the discipline of private property <br>
keeps me from being able to sponge of others, it keeps my hands out of your <br>
bank account, which compels me to try harder to serve the needs of others<br>
through market exchange, that I might be rewarded by consumers for my <br>
efforts.<br>
<p>
The logic of private property is expressed in the fact that life has<br>
evolved so as to brake "itself" into many small units, where each<br>
will attempt to fend for itself. Millions of years of evolution<br>
* prove * that this works, and life being one global collective <br>
blob does not, ipso facto.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; Private property claims can be enforced </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; locally, requiring only LOCAL knowledge. </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;   ERGO: Private property does NOT </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;   require a central State.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; No, but is does require force to back it up, which is just as bad.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Indeed. The "property line" is simply the spatially defined state-<br>
ment: "I'll use force if you cross this line." It's the force parameter. <br>
<p>
But is does not follow, as you've stated, that this is patently bad. <br>
Not all force is bad. A woman who fends-off a rapist uses force to back <br>
up her property claim. Without question, we agree that this force is <br>
proper, but it violates the rule you just layed out; and Therefore <br>
we cannot claim that "the use of force to defend property is bad."<br>
<p>
While we can agree on our bodies property line, the fuzzy area <br>
begins in our unified external area. In order to live I must <br>
be able to control external properties, and as "to control"<br>
is "to own," I must be able to own extenal property -- that is, <br>
to be able to exclude others from a give unit of matter outside<br>
my body. So it is a given that the use of force to defend property<br>
is a necessary basis for life and for any system of rights that <br>
are to promote life.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;   ERGO: Collectivized property </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;   require a central State by design.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; No, because I have enough faith in people that they can coordinate </i><br>
<i> &gt; themselves, share knowledge through electronic means, and then discuss </i><br>
<i> &gt; the issues this raises. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Are people in Equador going to send a message to people in Uganda, <br>
"Hay we grew more food than you did this year, come and get it."<br>
<p>
That is in a nut-shell the dynamic that needs to happen in the world<br>
your talking about. This idea falls apart in so many ways it seems futile <br>
to list them, it's just an idealist phantasm. <br>
<p>
The market says: "Hay we grew X amount of food and we would be willing <br>
to trade X quantity for Y in exchange. The same thing, only this time <br>
* both * sides make a collective input, not one side getting a freebee.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i> &gt;&gt; Furthermore, the collectivist's theory .... </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; weaves a logical and factual LEGAL web of </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; social debt that binds all people to one</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; another and in turn binds them to the </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; central cabal of planners that oversee </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; the allocation of social debt...</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; It's not a legal web, it's an economic one. However, if anyone </i><br>
<i> &gt; wants to leave they can, and do whatever they want. But people </i><br>
<i> &gt; will not stand for theives or dictators. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: But here's the fatal flaw in your ideology: the egalitarian ethic <br>
defines a "thief" as someone who has more stuff than another person. <br>
So the next village that had a better harvest, steals the quantity <br>
of food it has in excess of the other community. Such a standard<br>
of theft dictated by egalitarianism is clearly absurd -- surely <br>
you can see that?<br>
<p>
There is no way to get around it. Village A gets to keep its better <br>
harvest -- and that's private property -- or village A must surrender<br>
a portion of its harvest -- that's collective property. The result <br>
will be, like clockwork, that the incentive structure becomes geared <br>
towards doing less, investing less in this year's harvest, let the <br>
other guys carry the load this year.<br>
<p>
The long-range picture is less production, less innovation, and more<br>
poverty and human privations. Lo and behold, that's exactly what we<br>
see in every collectivist experiment -- its clockwork. Either you are <br>
(a) for human progress measured as growing wealth and technology <br>
access for all, or (b) you are for the safety and surety of no growth, <br>
and middle age like serfdom.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; Noting stops a person from going off and living off </i><br>
<i> &gt; the land, and they might even keep ties with society.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: If we operate under the assumption of equality of outcomes, <br>
then each person is in debt to society. The man in debt can never<br>
be allowed to just "walk away." It's called debt slavery, and <br>
collectivism is universal debt slavery by design.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; No it is not, because the fundamental relationship is one of slavery: </i><br>
<i> &gt; worker-employer. There is a huge power imbalance there. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: But your picture is missing a big portion of the whole picture.<br>
Your picture has excluded any measure of * how * an employer can to <br>
be in the position he/she is. In the free market, and employer is <br>
not more than an employee of the consumers. Society voted for them,<br>
they saved as many votes as they could and were eventually able to<br>
purchase means of production to activate toward the service of <br>
consumers. They then lobby with others to active these means <br>
of production, offering them what these workers are willing <br>
to take in exchange for a given job. <br>
<p>
There is no slavery here. The "boss" is but an employee of the <br>
consumer, assigned by the consumers based upon past performance <br>
to deliver a given service to the consumer, and the consumer <br>
is the whole of society. That is the ethical society.<br>
