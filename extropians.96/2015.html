I think that is the MOST condescending, giving no people respect, statement I<br>
have ever heard.  Do you think these people are subhuman?  Who gave you the<br>
godlike, better than the "majority" role here? Helpless victims of their<br>
boss...<br>
Are you a slave or a boss?<br>
 I must tell you straight out: those "poor masses" , those "slaves" are also<br>
human beings with dignity and may not appreciate the kind of "help" you<br>
propose. Nor your labeling them as helpless or as slaves.<br>
This is the most irritating thing about this kind of "liberal".  I have<br>
nothing against liberals,they mean well, but this kind of thing really is a<br>
blind spot. I live with it in my arts complex  where everyone ostensibly vies<br>
for who can do the most to "help" the poor masses,  the "others more<br>
unfortuante than we" -  but it is actually self serving self congratulatory<br>
rhetoric.  <br>
