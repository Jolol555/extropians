<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been going over thoughts such as these and have concluded that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are multiple values creating conflicts on this list, to name a few:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Message Depth vs Message Bredth</i><br>
<i>&gt; Confirm Beliefs vs Evolve Beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt; Emotion over Logic vs Logic over Emotion</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with everything on the right side of those listed. And my belief is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we should think logically and then act emotionally as opposed to act</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotionally then logically. Emotion over Logic leads to violent outbursts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotion which usually leads to nothing but arguments leading nowhere. Using</i><br>
<i>&gt; logic to think and then act with emotion is the better more rational route.</i><br>
<i>&gt; All this points to EQ I suppose. Emotion is mere entertainment from my</i><br>
<i>&gt; viewpoint. Emotion comes from the ancient reptilian brain deep within your</i><br>
<i>&gt; cranium where logic is fresh and new and one of the higher forms of thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; to help us rationalize and use tools. Why deny the fact that emotion is</i><br>
<i>&gt; vistigial (sp?) and only for mere entertainment now that we have logic?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It is only irrational emotions that are pointless. Emotion itself is not <br>
a bad thing,it keeps us from turning into serial killers. Logic and <br>
emotion temper each other. Souless logic is just as bad as unrestrained <br>
emotion. Emotions are not vestigial, they are as important as sex. Even <br>
if they are from the reptile brain, there is no need to abandon them. <br>
That would be like abandoning food in favour of pills:More efficient, but <br>
doesn't really satisfy. You can feel however you want, but just articulate <br>
why and provide some reasoning. Just turning on the flame throwers is not <br>
constructive. Same as if we all just spouted facts without using them for <br>
opinions, then this list would be no better than library.   <br>
