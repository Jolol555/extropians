My POV is that the term "potentially infinite indefinite lifespan" is<br>
apropos. The notion of identity has been discussed ad nauseum without<br>
any clear definition at all, and all the kinds of identity I can think<br>
of boil down to a set of memories and some kind of consistent connecting<br>
principle, such as "I experienced this". Well, memory is arbitrary once<br>
we leave the realm of carbon based bodies, and so identity becomes a<br>
very ephemeral concept. One aspect of uploads not thought of is whether<br>
the memories stored in carbon nerves, etc can become mapped in some<br>
standard way so that different individual memory sets can be made<br>
compatible (like data base formats). If so, I have all the attributes of<br>
cybernetic data, including making of copies, merger &amp; editing with other<br>
data sets, synthesis of avatars (and golems and daemons) for special<br>
purposes, etc, etc. Many of these created forms may have temporary<br>
purposes only to be deleted when no longer useful. I may become a set of<br>
entities, forever splitting and merging both with my versions and<br>
other's versions. By now, the idea of identity becomes blurry indeed. I<br>
can hardly recall how I was as a person ten years ago; I doubt that<br>
other than consulting an archival backup I could ever recall myself<br>
10,000 years ago...<br>
