<p>
I've had a mixed bag.  In general, I fear government agencies.  The one I<br>
deal with get promotions by finding people who are out of compliance with<br>
food, cosmetic, drug or nutritional supplement regulations.  <br>
<p>
The USDA:  I have yet to find anyone I dislike in this agency.  The people<br>
seem to competent, helpful and some are recognized world authorities.  When I<br>
call them with a problem, they are not looking for an ambush of any of my<br>
clients.  They do not ask my name or any other ambush information.  I have<br>
yet for them to inspect any of my clients even if we disclose sensitive<br>
information.  In general, this agency will work with me to solve problems.  I<br>
have published a paper jointly with them.   They have some "nice" people and<br>
many have said that they consider themselves as "Your tax dollars at work",<br>
i.e. service oriented.<br>
<p>
At this point I should say, if the regulatory agencies I deal with think you<br>
are trying to comply with the law, and not fight them,  they leave you pretty<br>
much alone.<br>
<p>
If they get a complaint from a customer about a regulated product,  that's a<br>
different story.  If they think the public will hammer on them for not taking<br>
harsh action.  They will take harsh action and get political brownie points<br>
in the process for doing a good job.  <br>
<p>
The FDA:  Basically the FDA is the same.  If they think you are truly trying,<br>
they will leave you a lone.  But,  they do look for trouble, even with out<br>
complaints.  No matter where a manufacturer starts,  they still will find<br>
something to improve upon.   This is how they get funding and promotions.<br>
 They really like to pounce on a company that argues with them.  They will<br>
take any authority they can possibly find in the laws and they interpret the<br>
laws always in their favor to enhance their power.  They will do this even if<br>
they know full well the interpretation will be overturned later in a law<br>
suit.    <br>
<p>
The FDA is highly politically correct and will enforce the laws that increase<br>
their power, funding, etc. most.  The animal testing laws for cosmetics are<br>
not currently being enforced because of this.<br>
<p>
The Post Office:  Just when I was able to sight horror stories galore, I got<br>
a knock on my door.  It was the local post master. I'm afraid this experience<br>
is the exception not the rule.  He came to apologize to me personally.  It's<br>
a long story, but I did not have snail mail delivery for 35 days and they had<br>
lost some of my mail.   This man was intelligent, helpful and we worked out<br>
all the problems.  He send a mail carried to my door several times to<br>
personally get my mail through.  The mail carrier was also nice.  <br>
<p>
The post master said the problem was the centralized mail system and<br>
explained how his works "stupid it was" to get orders form far off<br>
supervisors.  He told me that he was going to ignore the memorandums  that<br>
caused my mail to stop.   To me this just proves the de-centralization of<br>
centralization works.  The local government employees are nicer and get<br>
things done better than the nameless, faceless state and federal levels.   <br>
<p>
You might think I like the post office?  No,  they just destroyed a package<br>
of mine and don't want to pay the insurance on it.  The local post office<br>
employee I talked to was really (expletive deleted ) to me.  And, they wonder<br>
why people use UPS.<br>
<p>
As James said &gt;&gt;a small power trip for the federal worker involved.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree with James that many federal employees are "not capable or competent<br>
enough to get a job in the private sector".   There are a few who are,  Dr.<br>
Doug King (USDA)  but it's the bad ones that most people see.<br>
<p>
&lt;James&gt;  Anyone who is any good quits and works for the private sector. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes,  this happens most of the time.  My clients offer jobs to the good ones.<br>
 Their is a young microbiologist working for the FDA right now, I would like<br>
to hire.<br>
<p>
&lt; James&gt;  The federal  government is the employer of last resort.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I asked an FDA manager if I could get a job with the FDA.  He said "Yes, but<br>
knowing you, you wouldn't want it.  You would be frustrated all the time with<br>
the stupidity and go right back into the private sector."   <br>
<p>
&lt;James&gt; People are promoted based on seniority, not<br>
 qualification.  The cream does not rise to the top in the federal<br>
government.<br>
 And people wonder why so many government agencies are mismanaged.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
They are also promoted on how much positive publicity they can generate for<br>
the agency,  like nailing someone to the cross.<br>
<p>
&lt;James&gt;  That said, there are a few agencies in the government who have their<br>
act<br>
 together, but they are far and few between.  I think many government<br>
 employees need to be reminded that they work for *us*.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The USDA was "taken down" a notch in my book after they knowingly let<br>
_Salmonella_ into Chicago area milk from Jewel Food's processing plant Hill<br>
Farms.  The top managers were informed of the problem by the local USDA<br>
inspectors who recommended plant shut down.  (The _local_ inspectors had the<br>
right answer).   The managers said "But, we can't shut them down because they<br>
would go out of business.  We would be looked at as the bad guys for laying<br>
off so many people.  The the public and congress would have a field day."   <br>
<p>
Well,  they still have a field day because over 100,000 people got<br>
_Salmonella_ food poisoning and 12 people died.  Even "good" Government<br>
agencies don't work right in some very major incidents.  <br>
<p>
All the better to privatize and de-centralize.<br>
<p>
