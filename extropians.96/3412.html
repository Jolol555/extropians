<i>&gt; The self-proclaimed agnostic must still designate whether he does</i><br>
<i>&gt; or does not believe in a god -- and, in doing so, he commits himself to</i><br>
<i>&gt; theism or he commits himself to atheism.  BUT HE DOES COMMIT HIMSELF.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Agnosticism is not the escape clause that it is commonly thought to be.</i><br>
Disagree.<br>
I don't maintain that there is or is not a god. I don't definitely <br>
believe in god.<br>
I don't definitely disbelieve in god. Neither do I believe that it is <br>
unknowable whether there is a<br>
god or not. Just that I don't know, or know how to know. I could invoke <br>
Kosko and say<br>
that I both believe and disbelieve.<br>
I *definitely* don't believe in forcing black/white divisions on <br>
something that is as fuzzy as human belief. :-)<br>

-- Bob Grahame : &lt;bdg@mm-croy.mottmac.com&gt;<br>
-- Agnostic and proud of it!<br>
