        I can't resist to post this poem on this thread.  The poem was<br>
written quite a while ago, though I find the meanings to be very true<br>
and relevant to this thread.  BTW, if anyone is getting sick of my<br>
self-indulgence on this list (e.g.:: posting poems), please tell me and<br>
I'll tame my ego a little bit.<br>

Faith Or Freedom<br>
<p>
<p>
You are born into life<br>
Programmed<br>
And one day you'll be forced to decide<br>
Faith or Freedom?<br>
Both have profits, both have fault<br>
But only one can make you who you are<br>
And when it comes right down to it<br>
One will limit, one will get you far<br>
The choice is up to you<br>
Because you know what to do<br>
Live to obey<br>
Or wander astray<br>
And one day you'll be forced to decide<br>
Faith or Freedom?<br>
The choice is bold<br>
It can't be sold<br>
The wall is yours<br>
Or you can build some doors<br>
But what it comes down to<br>
Is the choice<br>
Between a chosen fate<br>
Or a god to dictate<br>
Your Faith or Freedom<br>
