On 13\10\96<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Here's what I am hoping this list will be: a place for people who fervently</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe in intellectual and technological progress to test and refine (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;discard) their ideas.</i><br>
<p>
        <br>
        For sure.  When I make a post, I try to be light-hearted about the<br>
whole idea, therefore I never intend offense: I am merely conveying *my*<br>
thoughts on a matter.  I can only think of one time that I have been<br>
offended [in the time that I've had a modem] and that was offlist.  The<br>
extropian list should be a forum for extropian conversation.  Signal, not<br>
noise (or jabber, as Churchill put it.)  Shall I say 'touche'?  :-)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If being extropian means checking my emotions at the door, than,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;fine, I should seek other fora.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
        No, it doesn't mean you should check your emotions at the door.  It<br>
appears to me, you are checking *other* peoples' emotions at the door.  I<br>
think people have a right to their opinions.  This list is for people to<br>
discuss their *extropian* opinions.<br>
<p>
<p>
                                        Ingredi, but not Externus!<br>
