<i>&gt; If you can assure me that during this experiment the AI is operating</i><br>
<i>&gt; completely on its own, and the "real person" is not permitted to post </i><br>
<i>&gt; to rescue the AI from giving itself away, then I can describe a test </i><br>
<i>&gt; that would resolve this question (assuming all of the humans cooperate). </i><br>
<p>
So, you are still trying to find some test *other than* the Turing test.  <br>
You admit that you can't resolve this question by reading the posts.  <br>
You are still trying to peek behind the curtain.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Come on.  The reason I am not willing to make such a statement </i><br>
<i>&gt; is that I (like most people) don't have the time to carefully read </i><br>
<i>&gt; and analyze all 50+ posts per day.</i><br>
<p>
A lame excuse.  You don't have time to read all the posts, but you do <br>
have time to set up some other test which requires "all of the humans" <br>
to cooperate!  <br>
<p>
It's interesting to me that you think you would have to read and analyze <br>
*all* the posts every day.  Why?  Can't you put some of us into an <br>
"obviously not AI" category, so you would only have to scrutinize the <br>
others?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The fact [that] the "AI" is using a borrowed identity also suggests </i><br>
<i>&gt; it has some serious weaknesses.  </i><br>
<p>
Whether it has weaknesses isn't the point.  We all have weaknesses.  <br>
The question here is whether the AI can successfully participate in <br>
the discussions on the list without giving itself away.  So far it has <br>
succeeded brilliantly.  Nobody has a clue about who it is, and most <br>
people seem to take it for granted that this is merely "Lyle's game,"    <br>
as Hal Finney put it.   <br>

<i>&gt; If there *is* an AI on the extropian ML, it's been doing </i><br>
<i>&gt; a good job of emulating humans, but a very bad job of </i><br>
<i>&gt; maintaining its own culture.  </i><br>
<p>
How do you know what it does when it's not posting to the list?  <br>
