<i>&gt;	If it were perfectly integrated with the new forebrain, emotion</i><br>
<i>&gt;would serve seamlessly to to warn, motivate, entertain, etc. and would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;easily programmable by the forebrain.  Unfortunately, it seems that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"emotional thinking" we share with other mammals continues on and can only</i><br>
<i>&gt;be overcome with conscious practice.</i><br>
<p>
True, but there is evidence that we're evolving to that point in the fact<br>
that we do _try_ to control ourselves as well as we can create designer<br>
emotions already by fusing sensory elements in our environment together to<br>
make a theme-like memory. A single memory would be like a picture or a sound<br>
but a theme memory takes the whole environment and compiles it into a<br>
feeling which you remember. These theme memories may be evolution taking the<br>
direction of entirely programmable emotions. Evolution is already helping us<br>
by taking the first steps to breaking down the hardwired part and softwiring<br>
the brain so that the whole thing becomes programmable. If this is so, i<br>
wonder if we looked at lower evolved man if their emotions and thoughts<br>
would be even more hardwired or instinctual?<br>
