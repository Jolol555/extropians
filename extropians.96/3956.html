I will try to address directly one challenge which David Brin makes:<br>
<p>
From: brin@cts.com (d.brin)<br>
<i>&gt; In fact, they cannot cite a single example from human history in which</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom was enhanced by selling masks and chadors to the poor.  But you</i><br>
<i>&gt; point to ANY occasion when freedom increased in the world, and I'll show</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it happened in direct correlation with increased ability by the masses</i><br>
<i>&gt; to see what the mighty were doing.   Zero percent versus 100 percent is</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty damn devastating.  As a protection of freedom, secrecy is no match</i><br>
<i>&gt; for transparency.</i><br>
<p>
First, it would be interesting to hear what David has to say about this<br>
in more detail.  I would like to see some specific examples of this<br>
100 percent correlation.  Perhaps his forthcoming book will discuss this.<br>
<p>
Let me briefly explain what I see as the relationship between the concepts<br>
of privacy and freedom.  This is not intended as an exhaustive or detailed<br>
definition, but just a broad description.  Privacy generally refers to<br>
my having control over information about myself; freedom refers to my<br>
control over my own actions.  The two concepts are closely analogous, one<br>
referring to the information world and the other to the physical world.<br>
To me, then, privacy is really the extension of my own freedom of self<br>
control into the information world.<br>
<p>
Heading towards David's challenge, then, in fact I would be surprised if<br>
David did not agree that historically, increased freedom and increased<br>
privacy have generally gone hand in hand.  This is actually a very<br>
natural phenomenon and can be easily understood.  In a history where<br>
there is a constant struggle by one group for control over another,<br>
often the most (or the only) practical way for someone to escape this<br>
control was avoidance.  They would move away, or adopt a low profile,<br>
"go underground".  They would avoid the soldier, the tax collector,<br>
the census taker.<br>
<p>
Doing this not only would gain freedom from control by others, but would<br>
achieve greater privacy as well.  Both of these occur as a result of<br>
putting physical or informational distance between themselves and the<br>
center of power.<br>
<p>
The same effect occurs even today.  People escape the unhappy confines of<br>
a stultifying small town, where everyone knows exactly what everyone else<br>
is doing, by moving to the relative anonymity of the big city.  They gain<br>
privacy, and as a result they gain freedom to live the lives they choose.<br>
<p>
Now I don't think this kind of phenomenon was exactly what David had<br>
in mind, since it occurs largely on an individual level.  It does not<br>
represent a historical advance on a large scale.  Rather, it was the<br>
result of millions of individuals taking the steps they could to get<br>
more control over their lives.  In the aggregate, though, I think the<br>
increased privacy and corresponding increased freedom which people<br>
achieved in this way was nevertheless very significant.<br>
<p>
(Keep in mind, too, that by its nature, privacy enhancement tends not<br>
to make it into the history books!  A person who successfully achieves<br>
privacy will not be a prominent public figure, he will be an "invisible<br>
man", someone who does not come to the attention of either the authorities<br>
or the historians.)<br>
<p>
Another point I would make is motivated by John Clark's example of<br>
Nazi Germany.  This is an example where a loss of privacy led to a loss<br>
of freedom.  Jews were first identified, then exterminated.  Opponents of<br>
gun control fear the same thing, that identification of gun ownership,<br>
a loss of privacy, will lead to gun control, a loss of freedom.  At the<br>
company where I work, we have frequently discussed the letters from<br>
Burmese freedom fighters and other resistance groups around the world,<br>
giving thanks for the availability of privacy protecting technology,<br>
which they say has saved many lives.<br>
<p>
This is not exactly what David was asking for, an example of privacy<br>
leading to freedom, but if losing privacy leads to loss of freedom this<br>
gives us equally good grounds to seek to retain our privacy.<br>
<p>
The best example I can give to directly address David's point, a case<br>
where I would argue that increased privacy provided the forces and<br>
motivations for a significant increase in freedom, is the American<br>
revolution.  The English colonies in America represented an extreme<br>
example of the avoidance phenomenon I cited above.  Away from British<br>
control, the colonists became accustomed to being left alone to fend<br>
for themselves.  When Britain tried to bring them back into the fold,<br>
to reassert British rule, the revolutionary war erupted.<br>
<p>
A key symbol of the revolutionaries was the rattlesnake flag, with its<br>
slogan, "don't tread on me."  This snake is not dangerous as long as you<br>
keep your distance and leave it alone.  It does not want to harm you,<br>
but if you insist on meddling with it, it will fight very unpleasantly.<br>
This culture of valuing privacy is one of the most distinctively American<br>
traits, and we retain it even today.<br>
<p>
It is true that these attitudes are part of a larger complex of beliefs,<br>
including suspicion of government power, so we are never going to see<br>
a pure example where privacy changed and all other variables stayed<br>
the same.  History doesn't work that way.  But I do think this is a<br>
case where the attitudes engendered by living successful, private lives<br>
led to a significant increase in freedom for everyone, as the American<br>
revolution became a model for people all over the world.<br>
