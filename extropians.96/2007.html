IAN: Plato@upx.net argues, and I disagree, that parents own the child <br>
until they surrender their claim, which could be when the child is 70 <br>
years old. The argumentation for this is quite solid.  The mother owns <br>
the egg the father the sperm. The father basically abandons his property, <br>
unless stated otherwise in contract. The mother at no time surrenders <br>
her claim to her egg, even as it grows into a child, is born and grows up.<br>
<p>
The only counter is that a sentient, or self-animated, being is a self-<br>
owner ipso facto. At the point of birth and childhood it's a fuzzy owner-<br>
ship, under which the mother can exert force, such as to pull the child's <br>
hand away from an electric socket. However, this "self-owner upon being a<br>
self-animated being" invokes another standard than pure property ownership,<br>
although even pure property ownership assumes a self-animated being is <br>
doing the owning, and has a right to ownership because it is such. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From an Extropian angle, the self-animated theory of ownership may </i><br>
be problematic because it invokes a kind of spiritual basis for rights. <br>
But since rights are a mental construct, and so is, perhaps, the soul, <br>
no big deal. ? Any ideas?<br>
