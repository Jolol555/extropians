You're missing the point.  The people most useful to target are the most<br>
likely to think about the incoming memes.  If you claim Moore's Law as<br>
evidence, and they think that you are silly for extending it like that,<br>
then their doubt and disbelief will probably count against the rest of<br>
your argument.  Excuse me, meme package.<br>
<p>
Snappy memes for simple minds.  Sophisticated memes for sophisticated<br>
minds.<br>
<p>
I also have a cognitive flaw; I have a low-level bias toward truth and<br>
honesty.  Lying is best done for very material and personal gain in a<br>
non-intellectual environment.  This is neither.<br>

Good luck.  That list could certainly use something else to talk about.<br>
<p>
But Kennita Watson's post reminded me of something: even if I believed<br>
in your version of the Singularity, I'm not sure that I would want to<br>
spread it like that.  I'd like some chance of surviving the Singularity<br>
in some manner, and the ingoing memes might have an effect.  Nazi<br>
scientists trigger Singularity; whee, we're all dead.  Paranoid<br>
survivalists trigger it; whee, we're all dead, or at least very tightly<br>
constrained.  "Nice" people trigger it; I might get spared, uploaded, or<br>
even transcended myself.<br>

Merry part,<br>
