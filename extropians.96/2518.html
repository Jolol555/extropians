Right.  Multiple personality "disorder" is a very different state from the<br>
"society of mind" multiple personalities some people have talked about here.<br>
 I'm not aware of a precise delineation of the difference between normal<br>
multifacted personality and pathological multiple personality.  I believe the<br>
original question was about the ability of multiple personalities to access<br>
each other's memories.  That, at least, would be one candidate for<br>
distinction; normal people have access to all the memories of all their<br>
personalities, subject to the numerous known imperfections of human memory.<br>
 Multiple personalities have complex shared memories; each personality can<br>
access the memories of some but not all other personalities.  Often memories<br>
are shared mostly in a parentage-type situation; each personality emerges as<br>
a defense mechanism of some other personality (its parent). Each personality<br>
can generally access the memories of its parent and ancestors but cannot<br>
access the memories of its children.  Its ability to access memories on other<br>
lines of descent varies.  The "original" personality, being the one that<br>
starts the whole process, usually can access only its own memories.  There is<br>
usually one personality which can access any memory, but I don't recall any<br>
such for "Eve".  <br>
