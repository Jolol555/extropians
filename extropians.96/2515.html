&lt;&lt; <br>
 OK, several things...<br>
 1) you seem to totally integrated the "Human Relations as Commerce" meme.<br>
    By your definition Romantic Love is Business.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, I think love can be thought of as a business.  I like business and don't<br>
think it is cold and heartless.  I think business is one of the more intimate<br>
relationships you can have with a person.  Business and love can be done on a<br>
one to one, eye to eye basis.  Extropy #3 had an article by Tom W. Bell "Love<br>
as a Contractual Relationship".  He states  an analogy: ". . . feelings are<br>
to love relations as profits are to business relations".  Sometimes you turn<br>
a profit and sometimes not.<br>
<p>
I think the point of the "We are all self-employed" is self-responsibility.<br>
 When we hurt someone's feelings we are hurting our "business" of living.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; 2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on<br>
trade ?<br>
<p>
Yes, it is based on trade:  Married people enter into a contractual<br>
relationship with all the meanings that has.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; 3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful<br>
people..."<br>
 <br>
I define it as people who are happy because they have satisfied the four<br>
areas of human happiness: to live well (eat, sleep, shelter, etc.) , to love<br>
(friends, lovers, customers, etc.), to learn (to know things about the<br>
world), and to leave a legacy (to leave their mark on the world.)<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; 4) Re:"We are all responsible for our own lives"<br>
    are we also responsible (to some extent) for the lives of our neighbours,<br>
    children, aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped ???<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
We are NOT primarily responsible for other people and here is why:  <br>
<p>
We are responsible for ourselves first,  NOT to our neighbors, children,<br>
aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped nor anyone else<br>
first.   If we can not take care of our selves we can not help anybody else.<br>
 "We are all self-employed" meme satisfies the first and basic need, to be<br>
responsible for oneself.   That is the basis of all other help we may then<br>
choose to give others.  <br>
<p>
Without the meme _We are all self-employed_  there can be no help given to<br>
anyone in the other groups you mention (friends, neighbors, children, aging<br>
parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped).  <br>
<p>
Imagine the alternative meme "We are all NOT self-employed".  To me that<br>
means "It's not MY neck (business) if I get in trouble.  Lets leach off<br>
someone else.  We don't need to be responsible for our own life.  I'll let my<br>
parents, government, religion, charity, neighbors, etc. help me and I don't<br>
need to worry about paying them back (altruism)."    It's a win-LOSE or<br>
lose-win meme, zero-sum game.  "We are all NOT self-employed"  could be the<br>
motto for a communist (or any "Big Brother" style) government or a<br>
socialist-libertarian anarchy.  <br>
<p>
"We are all self-employed" is a win-win idea for capitalist or<br>
libertarian-capitalist anarchy.  To get repeat love/business, treat other<br>
people the way you would like to be treated (The Golden Rule).  <br>
<p>
