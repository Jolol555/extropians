<i>&gt; Since the the more advanced simulations will suck more server</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, it would make sense that we have some way of allocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources according to people's ability to effectively use them.  It might</i><br>
<i>&gt; even prove an interesting exercise in a completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; laissez-faire system - people can gain credits for building a cool addition</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the world and charging admission</i><br>
<p>
Ah, the quota battles begin!  Quota on LambdaMOO was handled, last time<br>
I checked, by the ARB - the Architecture Review Board, I think it was. <br>
Ironically, arbitration is handled by the mediation system, which is<br>
totally unrelated to the ARB.<br>
<p>
Again from personal experience, I'd say there are three important things<br>
to remember about server-side resources:<br>
1)  When a better solution comes along, enforce it.<br>
  If LambdaMOO wasn't using their old obsolete systems it would cut<br>
quota<br>
usage in half and lag would go down 95%.<br>
2)  Keep only active areas in active memory.<br>
  On LambdaMOO, EVERYTHING is kept in RAM.  As opposed to WorldMOO,<br>
where<br>
things like help systems can be kept on disk.<br>
3)  Track the usage of actual resources.<br>
  LambdaMOO used to have an object quota; you got twenty objects.  This<br>
encouraged huge monolithic programming; there was no restraint on the<br>
number of methods on an object or how long those methods were. <br>
Object-oriented programmers were penalized because they could only use<br>
one object.<br>
  By the time they switched over to tracking bytes, the damage was done. <br>
All the core systems were these ridiculously large monoliths - I believe<br>
that an advanced old-style room cost 20K of OVERHEAD.<br>
  They still don't track CPU usage and as a result, command-line orders<br>
can take from 8 to 60 seconds to execute, with around 20 being around<br>
average.  This is because the system is so OVERLOADED with these<br>
gigantic monoliths.<br>
<p>
Overall, I'd say introduce a system where:<br>
1) A guy gets X bytes of RAM, Y bytes of disk space, and Z CPU<br>
cycles/day.<br>
2) The core architecture is laid out by a programmer who breathes the<br>
programming language being designed in.  Java is not C or even C++; make<br>
sure the world-builder knows that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (We can worry about building a "Permutation City" a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; closer to the Singularity...:))</i><br>
One of my all-time favorite books.  Vivid, realistic pictures of<br>
uploading,<br>
although, alas, upgrading is not addressed.  Three cheers for Greg Egan!<br>
