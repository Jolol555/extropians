You have left out basic curiosity. There are two not necessarily mutually<br>
exclusive paths to transhumanity. One is inward into our self constructed VR<br>
worlds, the other is outward into the universe. Some of us need to know what<br>
is over the next hill, others prefer to create their own hills on canvas, or<br>
watch hills on TV. Some who have the option to upload into a self contained,<br>
VR world might choose not to do so, because they can't help but want to know<br>
what is in the next star system in the 'real world'. I can forsee a future<br>
in which the artists and couch potatoes of the world are all uploaded into<br>
artificial worlds of their own or other's design, while the scientists and<br>
explorers of the world continue to point their outputs towards the external<br>
universe.<br>
<p>
And the conservatives and idiots and religious fanatics, they'll still be at<br>
their respective party conventions I imagine.<br>
