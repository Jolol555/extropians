<i>&gt;Can you elaborate on:  "A lot of this stuff is already out there?.."</i><br>

Yes, I should have made my reference more clear...most of today's<br>
computational physics/math, as I'm sure you're well aware, isn't exactly<br>
conducive to porting to Java and running on some internet server...the idea<br>
of having interactive, 3D applets to experiment with was more a nod to<br>
what's being done in Artificial Life, Cellular Automata, human-guided<br>
selection of mutating fractal forms; for example something like the Tierra<br>
Project or Polyworld<br>
could eventually be integrated into a VRML setting.<br>
<p>
However, that doesn't rule out having all sorts of hypertextual<br>
physics and math links that might be interesting and are available<br>
on the web...There already exist several preprint repositories for<br>
Physics, Math, Complexity Science, etc. that would be interesting<br>
to any transhumanist, for example there are a number of great,<br>
well illustrated nanotech papers available at the Foresight<br>
Institute and elsewhere.  And though most cutting edge simulations<br>
involve massive amounts of supercomputer resources, there is<br>
still many ways of working with multimeda on a more limited<br>
server. Basically the view would be towards education, background<br>
theory and the _results_ of the most recent simulations and research (As<br>
opposed to the simulation itself, as I may have<br>
misimplied)<br>
Such hypertext would of course handle equation and 2D and surface plots,<br>
potential-energy minimized molecules, tables/charts, schematics, diagrams,<br>
galleries of images from the HST or electron<br>
microscopy, tutorials like Michael Lorrey's on the Lorrey drive, or an<br>
applet dealing with mathematics like the one on "closed packing of spheres",<br>
which illustrates a geometrical principle out of Bucky Fuller's Synergetics.<br>
Basically, everything we can today with HTML, but with our minds open to the<br>
new possibilities for growth into the three-dimensional.<br>
<p>
Thanks for picking up on that, I can see how it might be<br>
misunderstood the way I said it...<br>
