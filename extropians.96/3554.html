        Indeed.  It is the first time that I have ever felt anger toward the<br>
tendency of certain threads on this list.  Right now, certain list members<br>
seem to be running around like headless chickens trying to 'convert' all who<br>
aren't extropian.  If 'the singularity' requires fanaticism, then count me<br>
out.  Don't get me wrong...I do want progress...<br>
but I want to see it effectively conveyed instead of force-fed to the<br>
unknowing\unwilling individual.<br>
<p>
        Back to the suspended animation ideas.  I wouldn't count on 'the<br>
singularity' or 'the spike' to save us from the current necessity of life<br>
and death.  I can't stop thinking that it seems like a principle such as the<br>
doomsayers use.  "The _________ is near!"  You can enter the words 'end' or<br>
'singularity' into that blank, but regardless, it is merely a hypothesis<br>
with nothing to ensure its happening.  Personally, I think suspended<br>
animation is a great idea.  At least it is doing *something* to at least<br>
*try* to preserve life.  I'm hoping --and I'll do everything I can to ensure<br>
it-- that there will be massive technological advancements in life-extension<br>
before I 'die', but if that doesn't pan out, I'd rather have the potential<br>
to live again than feed beetles and worms.<br>
