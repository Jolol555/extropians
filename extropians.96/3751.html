<i>&gt;it implemented.  Maybe, we can split it into Zones of thought: if</i><br>
<i>&gt;you can't pass the arithmetic entrance test, you can admire the</i><br>
<i>&gt;wonders of the Institute of Complexity from a distance, but can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;touch them, or talk to their developers.</i><br>
<p>
Since the the more advanced simulations will suck more server<br>
time, it would make sense that we have some way of allocating<br>
resources according to people's ability to effectively use them.  It might<br>
even prove an interesting exercise in a completely<br>
laissez-faire system - people can gain credits for building a cool addition<br>
to the world and charging admission, or for adding a link or program, or<br>
could gain access to certain places by passing competency tests...all this<br>
of course is speculation.  First and foremost though, the world should be a<br>
place just to have fun (but remember to bring your brain!), and for<br>
transhumanists and other interested thinkers to chill out and chat with<br>
others, share news and ideas, etc...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The only downside that I see to this is that such creation would</i><br>
<i>&gt;require effort to the tune of tens of millions of dollars (and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;a lot more still).  This could be done incrementally and after some</i><br>
<p>
Immersive, full-sensory 3D will of course be an expensive proposition, due<br>
to the high bandwidth and level of detail required.  What I had more in mind<br>
right now would just be a world that looked something like an online<br>
Transhumanist/Extropian version of the game "Myst" but where you can<br>
interact with other users online and play with some interesting applets.  <br>
(We can worry about building a "Permutation City" a little<br>
closer to the Singularity...:))<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;point the project may become self-supporting financially.  Still, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the time being directing extropian effort into the more substantive</i><br>
<i>&gt;development and propagation of ideas probably makes more sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Ironically, the first large-scale VRML worlds that we may see,</i><br>
<i>&gt;will most likely host various simulations of flesh, group sports,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and "uploads" of natural objects/scenes.  Thais is quite typical for</i><br>
<i>&gt;many breakthrough situations, when the opportunities provided by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the advanced fringe are exploited by the old but still powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt;Establishment.  (My other examples here would include human</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence that is still a servant to people's primary animal</i><br>
<i>&gt;urges, and results of the democratic revolution in Russia that</i><br>
<i>&gt;came through passionate struggle of its best people but were</i><br>
<i>&gt;mostly used to enrich the powerful Communist scums).</i><br>
<p>
I'm thinking that if we play our cards right, we <br>
might just be able leave the Establishment behind...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I wonder if this scheme of events is going to work all the way</i><br>
<i>&gt;through the rest of the social upload process (so far the liberation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of different social functional mechanisms from the old physical</i><br>
<i>&gt;carriers has been changing the tools, but not the nature, of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;society).</i><br>
<p>
Excellent call.  Ayn Rand wrote along similar lines, about<br>
how we live with and enjoy all the products of science,<br>
reason and productive genius, yet if you look at what<br>
occupies the time of 99% of society, we might as well be<br>
still in the jungle.  Changing this is unfortunately <br>
not a matter of higher technology, but of memetics.<br>
