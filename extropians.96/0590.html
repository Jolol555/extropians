          Combining this with what you said to Max More, that he <br>
          attributed too much to values and too little to social <br>
          institutions, as means for preventing that an &gt;AI does harm <br>
          to mankind, it seems that you are saying, in effect, that a <br>
          somewhat malicious &gt;AI would refrain from harming humans <br>
          because it would be _illegal_ for it to do so. The police <br>
          would come and get it. We could take up the discussion from <br>
          this point, but I fear I have misunderstood you again.<br>
