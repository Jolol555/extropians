I an sending this to both the Extropian and Transhuman list because I think <br>
everyone should read Robin's  fine article.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Robin Hanson has published a very interesting article on the Web called  <br>
"The Great Filter" ( <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html</a>). <br>
Robin argues, correctly I think, that if intelligent life is not somehow <br>
destroyed then eventually it will explode into the universe and make it's <br>
existence  obvious even on the Cosmological scale. He lists 7 stages that <br>
must happen before this happens.<br>
      <br>
1. Reproductive something (e.g. RNA) <br>
2. Simple single-cell life<br>
3. Complex single-cell life <br>
4. Multi-cell life <br>
5. Animals with big brains <br>
6. Where we are now  <br>
7. Explosion <br>
    <br>
Robin then notes that there is not the slightest evidence for intelligent <br>
life except on the earth (The Fermi Paradox) so one of these stages must be <br>
very difficult to pass through. If the roadblock happens somewhere in the  <br>
first 6 stages then we've already made it through and there is reason for <br>
optimism. If the trouble is between stage 6 and 7 then be afraid, be very <br>
afraid, most don't make it through. If this is the case then the problem is  <br>
probably not one we've imagined, probably not one we can imagine. If the <br>
recent talk about bacteria on Mars turns out to be true that means the first <br>
2 stages are easy to get through, not a good sign.<br>
 <br>
in spite of this I have a hunch the bottleneck is in the first 6 stages, I <br>
sure hope so. I want to talk a little about stages 5 and 6. Arthur C Clarke <br>
wrote a short story about a  race of noble horse like beings who had <br>
developed a complex and beautiful philosophy, possessed profound mathematical <br>
ideas, and were more intelligent than humans,  but they had no technology<br>
because the had no hands. Dolphins and whales in our world have very large <br>
brains, but not only are they lacking hands they have other handicaps they <br>
must overcome. If you live underwater you can't know anything about fire, an <br>
essential ingredient in technology.  Also, It's hard enough to deduce the <br>
basic laws of Physics living in an atmosphere, most of the laws are only<br>
really obvious in a vacuum,  surely a bizarre concept for any life form <br>
living in a thick heavy medium like water.  " What do you mean objects move <br>
in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an outside force?  <br>
What do you mean all objects fall to earth with the same acceleration <br>
regardless of size of weight? Any fool can see that's not true."<br>
 <br>
Elsewhere intelligent beings could have other problems. It took an <br>
Isaac Newton, who has a good claim on being the smartest man who ever lived, <br>
to deduce the  laws of gravitation from the motion of the planets, <br>
but Newton had it easy.  The sun is unusual, it has no companion, <br>
most stars consist of 2 or more suns of roughly equal mass revolving about <br>
each other. The orbit of any planets in such a system would be so horribly<br>
complex that even Newton wouldn't be smart enough to figure it out.<br>
