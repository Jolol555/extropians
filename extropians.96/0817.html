<i>&gt; highly portable information-structure with no fixed physical location or</i><br>
<i>&gt; body. I have a certain distaste for *having* to live in the flesh; I want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to live in a comfortable and useful body, without having to deal with the </i><br>
<i>&gt; vagaries of evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I really understand that many are not as interested in abandoning </i><br>
<i>&gt; their biological bodies; they have their charm too. </i><br>
<p>
Why does being living in a virtual world have to preclude living in the<br>
"real" world?  Why not create a virtual-real-world inside of the virtual<br>
world.  The actions in the virtual-real-world would correspond to<br>
actions made by a robot in the real world and as a result you could do<br>
any real-world work that needed to be done while still staying in a<br>
virtual world.  It seems to me a system like that would allow for<br>
continued interaction in the real world while seamlessly continuing to<br>
exist in a virtual world.<br>
<p>
One thing I don't understand is why anyone could possibly want to live<br>
in the physical real-world when they could have the chance to have their<br>
wildest dreams come true in a virtual world.  In a virtual world there<br>
are no laws of physics!  A person in a virtual world would be able to do<br>
anything in any way in any form they wanted to be in.  There would be no<br>
limits to the experiences which could be had or the accomplishments<br>
which could be made!  Uploaded beings would think much faster than<br>
fleshy beings and would therefore be able to accomplish anything that<br>
can be accomplished in the real world in a tiny fraction of the time!<br>
<p>
What would space exploration mean if people could be uploaded?  Couldn't<br>
any of the current unmanned space probes that are currently in use be<br>
used to ferry uploaded beings to the far reaches of the galaxy?  Isn't<br>
the major limiting factor on space travel today the problem of<br>
sustaining the life of fleshy, oxygen-breathing, limited-life-span<br>
humans?  If we get rid of the flesh we get rid of the barriers.<br>
<p>
With all these things going for virtual worlds and uploading, I have a<br>
hard time comprehending how anyone would want to choose the limited,<br>
constrained life of a fleshy, oxygen breathing, limited-life-span human.<br>
<p>
I would shed my flesh in a second if I ever had the chance to be<br>
uploaded into a virtual world.<br>
