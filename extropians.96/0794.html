I believe it might work, but only if applied in layers.  I can't say that <br>
the extropian meme is more or less complex than a popular religion, or <br>
even if it's more or less difficult to understand (if your bothered by <br>
glaring contradictions, extropianism is easier to grasp simply because it <br>
is possible to grasp!), where the general populace is concerned.  I can <br>
say that _being_ an Extropian is difficult insofar as it requires lots of <br>
effort.  <br>
<p>
I'm new to the list and it is the first contact I've had with <br>
Extropians.  The extropian meme infected my mind (boy did it feel good!) <br>
by way of the Wired vector in 1994.  Though I have just recently made <br>
contact with other Extropians, the past two years (roughly) have seen a <br>
steady rate of-- pardon me as I show of my new vocabulary word-- <br>
automorphing.  The word is new to me but the act is not.<br>
<p>
In those two years, I have expended huge amounts of energy and effort to <br>
get from then to now (i'll spareyou the details, but it was a long way).  <br>
And though I'm with you in spirit, I've got lots to learn.  I have a <br>
formidable stack of books on philosophy, pop- scienc, not to mention a <br>
box full of Discover and Scientific American (not that I see Extropians <br>
as strictly science oriented).  All this and I still don't know what the <br>
hell you folks are talking about sometimes-- you are hard-core!  I look <br>
forward to the challenge of getting up to speed.<br>
<p>
Extropians are in a state of high energy.  While for us this is a <br>
desirable state, it is still unfavorable, and the populace is not exempt <br>
from the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  The extropian meme has the <br>
undesirable trait, in terms of its replicability, of requiring lots of <br>
energy to actualize, to become Extropian.  To expect that sugar coating <br>
hard work will make it desirable to the masses seems to me iffy at best, <br>
not to mention that sugar coating may distort, or even pervert extropian <br>
philosophy.<br>
<p>
I suggest serving transhuman memes a spoon full at a time, each building <br>
on the last, as opposed to unleasing a media onslaught.  We may find that <br>
humans, like amphibians, will be more receptive to a gradual increase of <br>
energy and not turn the frying pan on us.<br>
<p>
I look forard to learning with/from you.  /   you.<br>
<p>
Up, up, and Away!<br>
