<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe people shouldn't have happy childhoods.  Maybe misery is the way</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to grow.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A very dangerous meme. I don't think it is true, since misery is quite </i><br>
<i>&gt;likely to result in learned helplessness. My guess is that all we on this </i><br>
<i>&gt;list that were seriously harassed in school belong to the group that </i><br>
<i>&gt;*didn't* become helpless - the others are quite likely to want to remain </i><br>
<i>&gt;strictly mehums now, out of fear for the reactions of others.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps, but the reason we were picked on was because of our intelligence<br>
wasn't it? (Oh no! I'm starting to sound like a collective!) I don't know<br>
about you guys, but we're you noticibly different from the start<br>
intellectually. I know I was. Also perhaps there is some link between<br>
skipping crawling and going straight on to walking and an extropian novelty<br>
gene? I sure do hope that the extropian trend is entirely<br>
environmentally-based or else we'll have a difficult time converting the<br>
masses.<br>
