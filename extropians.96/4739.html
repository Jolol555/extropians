<i>&gt; As I once put it, the goal of transhumanism is to create gods that </i><br>

<p>
Interesting concept -- to create gods.  The presumption seems to be that <br>
it is possible for gods to exist, but they don't exist yet -- it's up to us <br>
to create them.  <br>
<p>
What kind of space do gods exist in?  -- I am not referring to "space" <br>
in the ordinary sense of the word, i.e. three-dimensional space.  In <br>
mathematics, we have vector spaces, topological spaces, and so forth.  <br>
Graphics designers speak of "color space."  That's the kind of space <br>
I'm talking about.  Do gods exist in some kind of deity space?  <br>
<p>
You seem to be saying that deity space is now empty, but is not <br>
*necessarily* empty.  Gods can exist, but they don't exist yet.  <br>
This seems to me like saying that it is possible for even numbers <br>
to exist, but they don't exist yet -- it's up to us to create them.  <br>
Or, it is possible for colors to exist, but they don't exist yet -- we <br>
have to create them.  <br>
<p>
There are some spaces for which this idea would make sense.  For <br>
example,  consider all musical compositions to exist in "music space."  <br>
Five hundred years ago, someone could have said, "It is possible for <br>
symphonies to exist, but they don't exist yet.  We have to create them."  <br>
However, even then music space wasn't empty.  Going back farther, <br>
back to prehistoric times, there was a time before music.  There was a <br>
time when music space was empty, and someone could have said, "It's <br>
possible for songs to exist, but they don't exist yet.  It's up to us to <br>
create them."  <br>
<p>
You are postulating that deity space is like music space or <br>
machine space -- gods are the sort of thing that can be created.  <br>
You are also postulating that the entities that populate deity space  <br>
may or may not laugh -- it is possible for gods to be either <br>
laughing or non-laughing; Jove or YHWH.   <br>
<p>
And you are proposing that we attempt to create a god that <br>
not only laughs, but can stand being laughed at.  <br>
<p>
I'm not sure if you are also assuming that deity space is now empty, <br>
like music space was before the first song was sung.  <br>
<p>
The problem is, there is a non-laughing god who claims that he <br>
already exists, and that he is the King of the Hill; and who backs up <br>
these claims by inspiring his followers to exert a real force in the world.  <br>
He calls himself YHWH, or "the Lord."  <br>
<p>
There is only one recorded instance, that I know of, where he laughed <br>
(Psalm #2):  <br>
<p>
!    Why do the nations conspire <br>
!        and the peoples plot in vain?  <br>
!    The kings of the earth take their stand <br>
!        and the rulers take counsel together <br>
!    against the Lord [YHWH]  <br>
!        and against his anointed. <br>
!    "Let us break their chains," they say, <br>
!        "and throw off their fetters."  <br>
!<br>
!    &gt;&gt;The One enthroned in heaven laughs; &lt;&lt;<br>
!        the Lord [YHWH] scoffs at them.  <br>
!    Then he rebukes them in his anger <br>
!        and terrifies them in his wrath, saying <br>
!    "I have installed my King <br>
!        on Zion, my holy hill."  <br>
!<br>
!    I will proclaim the decree of the Lord [YHWH]:  <br>
!<br>
!    He said to me, "You are my Son, <br>
!        today I have become your Father. <br>
!    Ask of me, <br>
!        and I will make the nations your inheritance, <br>
!        the ends of the earth your possession. <br>
!    You will rule them with an iron scepter; <br>
!        you will dash them to pieces like pottery." <br>
!<br>
!    Therefore, you kings, be wise; <br>
!        be warned, you rulers of the earth. <br>
!    Serve the Lord with fear <br>
!        and rejoice with trembling.  <br>
!    Kiss the Son, lest he be angry <br>
!        and you be destroyed in your way, <br>
!        for his wrath can flare up in a moment.  <br>
!    Blessed are all who take refuge in him.   <br>
<p>
"The One enthroned in heaven laughs" --  this is not Jovial laughter, <br>
this is the har har har of the victor stomping his opponent's head.  <br>
As far as I can tell, this is the only time in the Old Testament when <br>
"the Lord" laughs at all.  <br>
<p>
The English word "Lord" has become such a cliche' that it has lost <br>
most of its meaning.  If you consider the Latin equivalent, Dominus, <br>
the meaning is clearer:  the Lord is somebody who dominates.  <br>
The Boss.  Somebody you don't treat with disrespect, or even with <br>
too much familiarity.  The peasants don't talk back to the Lord of the <br>
Manor, let alone laugh at him.  They approach him with fear and <br>
trembling. <br>
<p>
Mr. Singularity reminds us what "the Lord" means when he writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Another sure way of revealing the sacred cows is to try to joke </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; about them. If there is anything a sacred cow cannot stand, it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; humour (at least about itself, joking about others sacred cows is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; quite acceptable). The best way to reveal someone to be a fanatic or </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; memeoid is to see if he or she can joke about his or her beliefs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do I qualify?  I see the Holocaust as a horrendous tragedy, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and if someone smaller than me made a joke about it, I'd </i><br>
<i>&gt; punch his lights out.  </i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  And since you don't have to do it by yourself -- <br>
you have your extended family, and YHWH himself, backing you up -- <br>
*everybody* is smaller than you.  <br>
<p>
In the presence of YHWH, one doesn't laugh.  One bends the knee.  <br>
<p>
The question is whether it is possible to "create" a new god, <br>
a more Jovial god, who can laugh at anything and get away with it -- <br>
and who can even stand being joked about.  <br>
<p>
The operational meaning of this is:   Can such a god <br>
inspire his followers to exert a real force in the world?  <br>
