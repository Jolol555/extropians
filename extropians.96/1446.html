I was in Best Buy yesterday and I just happened to glance over and see a<br>
huge TV showing off the new Nintendo Ultra64 running Mario64. The system<br>
itself costs $200 without any games and Mario64 is $70. There are only two<br>
games for it currently but I can tell instantly by looking at Mario64 that<br>
it's a definite winner. Kicks the shit outta Playstation. I am REALLY<br>
impressed by the graphics it displays. It uses a silicon graphics chip to do<br>
spectacular 3D rendering in realtime. They were able to convert a 2D game<br>
like Mario into 3D and did a spectacular job with it. Just looking at<br>
Mario64 I get to thinking how in the next 5 years we may have powerful VR at<br>
our fingertips and able to chat with high-res avatars over the net like the<br>
way the metaverse is described in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.<br>
I CAN'T WAIT!<br>
