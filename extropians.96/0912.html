&lt;&lt;  If you haven't seen the Nolan<br>
 Chart, which makes progress by mapping views into two dimensions, I<br>
 recommend taking a look. I believe there's a link to it somewhere on Eric<br>
 Watt Forste's Extropians web site in one of the sections dealing with<br>
politics.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I have not seen Nolan's chart. I will be looking it up.  In the mean time: I<br>
wonder how it compares to Tuccille's?  <br>
<p>
See the chart in Tuccille's book _It Usually Begins with Any Rand_  page 38. <br>
<p>
My interpretation follows.<br>
<p>
The chart has a compass face or clock-like face:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From 10 o'clock to 2 is "Welfarism and the Mixed Economy": 11 o'clock is</i><br>
Moderate liberalism, 12 is Center, 1 is Moderate conservatism.  <br>
((This is the part I interpret as Left (Democrat) and Right (Republican)- my<br>
thoughts only)) In Tuccille's book this is only two eighths of the full<br>
spectrum.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From 8 o'clock to 4 is the area of Libertarianism: At 7 o'clock is</i><br>
"Spontaneous Socialism" (Little on no governmental control over the<br>
individual).  Moving away from this area,  from 7 to 6 o'clock is the<br>
spectrum is called "Collectivist Anarchy".   At 6 moving to 5 and finally 4<br>
o'clock, is "Individualist Anarchy and Laissez-Faire Capitalism" (also with<br>
little of no governmental control over he individual).<br>
<p>
At 9 o'clock is "Communism" (total governmental ownership). This area starts<br>
from 9 and moves (away from Communism) up to 10 o'clock labeled "Liberal<br>
Left" and down the clock, 8 o'clock, to "Extreme Left".  <br>
<p>
Filling in the final part of the clock face. . . <br>
<p>
At 3 is "Fascism" (total government control of personal property).  You can<br>
own property but you can't do what you want with it. (So, you _really_don't_<br>
own property).  This area starts at 3 and goes up the clock to 2<br>
(Conservative right) and down to 4 (Extreme right).<br>
 <br>
Now I understand why some see me as being: "So Left, I'm Right.  Communism at<br>
9 and Fascism at 3. . .   I am at 6 o'cock=Libertarian, not 12=Centrist.<br>
  :-)<br>
<p>
I don't think I have to be labeled as being Extropian and therefore<br>
Libertarian.  I am Libertarian but this is my view only. Other Extropians are<br>
not required to think like me.  I see Extropianism as a logical integration<br>
with  Libertarianism for my personal philosophy.  <br>
<p>
The state sponsors capital punishment and imposes it on the individual.  I am<br>
against it.  I don't think they can get the law right for such a "final<br>
solution".   In my opinion the term "Capital Punishment" should be changed<br>
to: "The-ugly-poor-male's penalty for murder" and penalty for having an<br>
unlucky/bad attorney.<br>
<p>
As an Extropian, the idea of ending life, even for the "most deserving", is<br>
disadvantageous for me.  Innocent people have been convicted and killed.<br>
 With this law still active, it is a threat for me and my Extropian<br>
expectations.  <br>
