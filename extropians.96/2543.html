<i>&gt; &gt;Once the entire background situation changes qualitatively, sex is obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an evolutionary sense, probably. But already sex is used mostly for</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasure and self-expression, not procreation. Making a universal statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; like "sex is obsolete" requires you to make more of an argument. Why should</i><br>
<p>
Some argumentation is required, agreed. (though I consider the fact being <br>
quite obvious).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; everyone stop having sex (in whatever future form) just because *you* don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; see it as worthwhile in your future life? Would you do away with all other</i><br>
<p>
Alas, I don't think I (nor anybody else) will have much to say in the <br>
matter, at least not for long... Mind ecologies will have their own <br>
dynamics, impose its own set of constraints upon its denizens -- whether <br>
they like it or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; pleasurable and expressive activities if they are not tied to survival or</i><br>
<i>&gt; material gain (if these are the values you see as central for uploads)?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think the uploads will be able to afford conventional (simulated <br>
flesh) sex much longer. If we assume resources to be limited (unless <br>
computation can be detached from the material carrier and we start <br>
engineering our designer universes) _and_ we admit Darwinian evolution in <br>
(it will be impossible to keep him out, I'm afraid -- notice that this <br>
automagically introduces some form of death, or do we speak Lamarckian <br>
evolution here, where mutation leaves the organism altered, but alive-o?), <br>
we'll wind up having scarce resources, more sooner than later. Some of them <br>
being time (attention devoted, etc), computation, whatever.<br>
<p>
Burning computational resources for body dynamics, fakespace renderers, <br>
etc. might become too costly, once entire system matter has been <br>
converted into a Dyson shell computer (very soon, &lt;&lt;1 kYr), and this <br>
mind substrate dish populated sufficiently densely (much faster, &lt;&lt;1 Yr).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Rather than saying "sex is obsolete" in the changed conditions of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future, I think it more reasonable to say that sex will be optional. We will</i><br>
<p>
Please observe the caveat in the original post. If we have sexual<br>
autoreplication (chimaeric offspring generated from two or more <br>
contributors), we will have a form of sex. Since I (extremely <br>
unscientifically) conjecture we'll stick with emotions, the act will be <br>
probably emotionally loaded (since emotions probably cause us to act at <br>
all).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; be able to choose whether, when, how much, and with regard to who/what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel sexual urges. Becoming posthuman to me means not abolishing everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; about being human (though somethings may be good to abolish) but making them</i><br>
<i>&gt; a matter of choice, and being able to refine them.</i><br>
<p>
As I said, the substrate is different, yet it still has its constraints. <br>
Maybe, as Anders once said, we'll keep our olfactory bulbs &amp; Co, as a <br>
fundament for otherwise streamlined structures... I do not know.<br>
