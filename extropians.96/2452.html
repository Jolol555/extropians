Remember the "dust theory" - Permutation City was not run on any specific <br>
physical computer, but on the general substrate of reality. So if this <br>
substrate is finite (the Bekenstein Bound for the entire spacetime is <br>
finite), then Permutation City will eventually stop growing, while if it <br>
is infinite (like in an open universe) then it can (and will) run <br>
forever. <br>
<p>
There is a slight complication here; the laws of physics in the City would<br>
imply with mathematical certainty that their cubical universe would expand<br>
forever. If there isn't enough computing stuff in reality, then we have a<br>
contradiction that cannot be resolved - unless we assume that strong<br>
platonic materialism holds, and the substrate of computation isn't really<br>
the physical universe but mathematical reality. This is just another way<br>
of saying that if we ignore Egan's inconsistencies near the end, strong <br>
platonic materialism or an infinite universe holds.<br>
<p>
I like this book for the way Egan takes an ontology and develops it <br>
beyond its limits.<br>
