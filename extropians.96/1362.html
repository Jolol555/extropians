<i>&gt;          Dan Clemmensen has suggested that SIs don't colonise cosmos </i><br>
<i>&gt;          because of their high discount rate for future benefits. The </i><br>
<i>&gt;          discount rate would presumably be high because of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;          rapidity of their subjective time and the slowness of cosmic </i><br>
<i>&gt;          travels. The idea is interesting since, if right, it would </i><br>
<i>&gt;          help resolve the Fermi paradox.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          One reason why SIs could have a high discount rate would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;          if they had a bias towards the near future, just as we </i><br>
<i>&gt;          humans have. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Suppose that the objective of the SI is to maximise the </i><br>
<i>&gt;          amount of valuable computations it will carry out during its </i><br>
<i>&gt;          life time. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;          that the gains would be obtained after perhaps a thousand </i><br>
<i>&gt;          years and be enjoyed for perhaps billions of years, while </i><br>
<i>&gt;          the required investment would presumably be very small ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;          If Robin's objection, that not all knowledge can be obtained </i><br>
<i>&gt;          simply by sitting back and think (making computations), ... I</i><br>
<i>&gt;          don't think it carries very much weight, because there is no </i><br>
<i>&gt;          obvious reason why SIs should be interested in the detailed </i><br>
<i>&gt;          structure of distant cosmic regions. We must not forget that </i><br>
<i>&gt;          a mere suggestion for where the Great Filter could be, even </i><br>
<i>&gt;          if it falls short of being a proof, would be very helpful; </i><br>
 <br>
Let us also recall that each step of the filter has a size.  An<br>
argument that might be sufficient for saying the some of the filter<br>
lies at any one point might be insufficient for saying that all of it<br>
lies there.  Even if you persuade me that only one in ten star systems<br>
cares about actually seeing the distant universe up close, that still<br>
leaves a ten to the twenty filter to be explained.  <br>
<p>
Though I said this before, let me also repeat that discount rates are <br>
evolutionarily endogenous.  Our discount rate is not biased relative<br>
to the context where it evolved.  And with competition, we should<br>
expect future discount rates to track the local growth rate.  And<br>
limits to growth are hit, agents should care about farther and farther<br>
into the future.  There really are academic papers on this sort of thing.<br>
