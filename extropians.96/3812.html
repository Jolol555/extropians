<p>
Are you referencing user technology or development technology?  The<br>
development technology is accessible now, although I agree that the average<br>
PC owner may not have the required technology or bandwidth to use the<br>
environment effectively once it is developed.  Downloading the finished<br>
environment would probably be a somewhat lengthy task, especially over<br>
modem, and interactivity might be somewhat taxed by bandwidth issues.  Once<br>
the environment is fully loaded, however, it is possible to operate much of<br>
the environment via a 28.8k modem.  <br>
<p>
An alternative to this would be to periodically distribute a CD-ROM that<br>
contained much of the static content of the World.  Then the user would only<br>
have to download the portions that are dynamic or have changed.  Ultimately<br>
bandwidth will be the most significant factor.  But until everyone has<br>
ISDN/ADSL/Cable connections, we'll have to make do with what we have.<br>
<p>
One thing that I envision is having a coffee shop or something with a bunch<br>
of terminals with 10Mbit or 100Mbit access to one of the World servers.<br>
Setup dedicated communication channels between World server hubs via the<br>
Internet.  This would allow people to have fast, real-time access to the<br>
world via centralized access.  A smart, well-designed architecture would<br>
allow the possibility of building a very large distributed world, but<br>
without massive bandwidth requirements.  Admittedly though, modem<br>
connections would suck no matter which way you cut it.<br>
<p>
No one said it would be easy, but I definitely think a viable solution is<br>
possible.<br>
