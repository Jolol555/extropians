CALLING FOR ARTISTS:<br>
<p>
The "Transhumanist Art" Web site will list artists with links to their sits,<br>
as well as a virtual gallery for images, essays, poems, etc.<br>
<p>
Please send me (privately):<br>
<p>
1.      Your Name<br>
2.      Short Bio<br>
3.      Medium (or non-medium) <br>
4.      Links to your site, if you have one<br>
5.      jpegs or gif files (one per person)<br>
6.      Essays - one please (at least for now)<br>
7.      Poem - your favorite (at least for now)<br>
<p>
Thank you for your contributions!<br>
<p>
If you aren't an "artist", but have creative ideas and would like to<br>
contribute, please do!  My definition of artist is kind of a "creative<br>
individual" -- so, scientists are welcome too.<br>
<p>
Also:   For the TH List:  I'd like the consent of Damien, QueenMuse, Peter,<br>
Rich, Robin, Katheryn, Anders and anyone else who participated in the Arts &amp;<br>
Sciences thread to use some of the material.  It is wonderful to read and<br>
has a theatrical flare to it!  (Like a Woody Allen script.) I'd love to hear<br>
from you.<br>
<p>
        For the Extropian List:  Any contributions re art and science welcome.<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
<p>
