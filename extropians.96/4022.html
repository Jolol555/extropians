Agree. It is a seriously bad idea to eat parts of a human (or a higher <br>
primate) CNS, whether raw or cooked. Especially, if it is a deceased person.<br>
<p>
A lot of CNS diseases rare in Europe were quite common in that part of <br>
the world which practiced ritual cannibalism. I seem dimly recall the <br>
occurence of curucuru (sp?) where women/childred had to unearth and then <br>
to excavate the contents of the cranial cavity of their deseased <br>
relatives. Skin cuts were enough for an infection, even no need for a <br>
quick snack.<br>
<p>
Apropos higher primates: whenever a parasite manages a leap from its target <br>
host the stakes are high it is maladapted. Usually, it kills a large <br>
number of the new hosts before both adapt sufficiently to each other. <br>
Density of species is very high in rain forests, and since both the <br>
habitats are routinely destructed _and_ there is a large number of <br>
genetically pretty homogenous new hosts (humans) in the immediate <br>
vicinity no wonder lots of wonderful new bugs comes from the tropics. <br>
HIV and Ebola are only the most prominent examples. (Apart from that,<br>
large-scale tourism selects the more vicious bugs).<br>
<p>
One should point out, that we were very lucky in case of HIV. If the <br>
bug was as susceptible as a rhinovirus, a lot of us wouldn't be reading <br>
this list, in fact there would probably be no such list at all. The scary <br>
part is that the danger is not over, a bug with such a high <br>
latency/lethality may be well under way. HIV has been detected in <br>
specimens from 1956...<br>
