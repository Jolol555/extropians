What about Dyson's work on the infinite survivability of sophontic life <br>
in an indefinitely expanding, cooling universe? It's been a long time <br>
since I read this, and I haven't read Tipler's recent book yet either, <br>
but it doesn't seem to me that making an assumption of the possibility of <br>
infinite computation settles the question one way or the other.<br>
<p>
The Heat Death (I use the term with irony) is approached just as<br>
asymptotically as the Big Crunch, and it would be approached *much* more<br>
slowly, which would give more time for life forms to adapt to the changes<br>
in their physical environment. In the Heat Death scenario, computation<br>
would gradually but inexorably slow down, but it would have a future that<br>
is, for all practical purposes, infinite. It's not as if one day God is<br>
going to flip a big switch that wipes out all the remaining negentroy in<br>
the universe. The point of exactly zero negentroy is infinitely far off in<br>
the future. Computation approaching the Big Crunch, on the other hand,<br>
would have a sharp future time limit, but would speed up "infinitely" as<br>
it approached that limit. <br>
<p>
Either future would require continuous steady adjustment of our "natural <br>
time scale", but I think we could adapt just as well to either one.<br>
<p>
And then there's always the possibility advocated by the Alfvenite<br>
steady-state heretics. At the moment, the Alfvenite/Lernerite stuff<br>
doesn't seem plausible to me, but I think the certainty with which we know<br>
Big Bang theory to be true is greatly exaggerated. Such exaggeration about<br>
the certain truth of theories that are poorly understood by the general<br>
population is usually to the advantage of those who do understand those<br>
theories, especially when seeking funding for further research.<br>
