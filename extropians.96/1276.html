I am forwarding this to the extropian list on request of<br>
Richard MacKinnon &lt;spartan@shell.portal.com&gt;; hope you will find<br>
his work of interest.  Please do not distribute it beyond the list.<br>

************************************************************************<br>
Greetings!  I'm inviting you to participate on the all-star, rapid-strike<br>
ad hoc reviwing committee for my upcoming paper "Punishing the Persona:<br>
Correctional Strategies for the Virtual Offender" to be published as a<br>
chapter in _The Undernet_:  Internet and the Other (Steven Jones, ed.) Sage<br>
Press.<br>
<p>
This paper constitutes the third part of my research trilogy investigating<br>
governance, crime, and punishment in virtual systems.  The other parts are:<br>
<p>
"Searching for the Leviathan in Usenet" in _Cybersociety:  Computer-Mediated<br>
Communication and Community_ (1995), Steven Jones (ed.), Sage Press.<br>
<p>
"The Social Construction of Rape in Virtual Reality" in _Network and<br>
Netplay:  Groups on the Internet_ (forthing in 1996), Fay Sudweeks, Margaret<br>
McLaughlin, and Sheizaf Rafaeli (eds.), MIT Press and the Association for<br>
the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).<br>
<p>
If you are interested in commenting on the current draft of "Punishing the<br>
Persona," your "rapid-strike" response is urged, otherwise I may not be able<br>
to address your comments until another project (PtP, version 2.0??).<br>
<p>
The secret URL for the paper is: <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.portal.com/~rich/texts/punish.html">http://www.portal.com/~rich/texts/punish.html</a><br>
<p>
You may circulate the paper to others who may wish to comment, but the<br>
purpose of the "secret URL" is to discourage mass distribution.  This is<br>
just a draft.  I don't want people archiving an unfinished product.<br>
<p>
Next is a little blurb about followed by the paper's abstract.  I hope to<br>
hear from you soon.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks in advance,<br>
<p>

<p>
                  Richard MacKinnon (<a href="http://www.portal.com/~rich/">http://www.portal.com/~rich/</a>) is a<br>
            political scientist in the Government Department and the<br>
            Advanced Communication Technologies Laboratory (ACTLAB) at<br>
            the University of Texas at Austin.  As a former police<br>
            officer, he is able to draw on his law enforcement<br>
            background to inform his theories for addressing computer-<br>
            mediated crime and virtual offenders.  His research<br>
            interests are in the political anthropology, cultural<br>
            studies, and governance of virtual environments.  Currently,<br>
            he is co-developing _honoria in ciberspazio_, a cyberopera<br>
            about net.relationships and fleshmeets.  He spends most of<br>
            his online time dwelling in a community called Cybermind and<br>
            after spending several years in Silicon Valley, he now lives<br>
            in Austin.<br>

                                      ABSTRACT<br>
<p>
                  The development of cybersociety poses significant<br>
            theoretical and socio-political challenges attributable to a<br>
            social space populated by "bodyless" beings.  This chapter<br>
            explores the phenomenon of bodylessness and its<br>
            ramifications for the criminal corrections process.  In the<br>
            case of a well-known virtual rape, the perpetrator's account<br>
            was deleted following a meeting of the virtual community's<br>
            members.  This virtual execution of his online persona is<br>
            rigorously analyzed to determine if punishment of virtual<br>
            bodies is a suitable means for meting out virtual<br>
            jurisprudence.  Guided largely by Foucault's insight into<br>
            non-corporal or bodyless punishment, a standard of "just<br>
            adjudication" is developed to insure that the punishment<br>
            fits the crime.  In part, this standard directs punishment<br>
            for virtual offenses primarily towards the virtual body.<br>
            Accordingly, offline offenses ought to be directed primarily<br>
            towards the user.  To this end, a classification scheme is<br>
            proposed to differentiate virtual offenses from conventional<br>
            computer crimes.  Three cases are examined in light of this<br>
            classification and standard.  They are the "rape of legba;"<br>
            the University of Michigan student, Jake Baker, who was<br>
            arrested and expelled for his Usenet posting of a "sex<br>
            fantasy;" and Kevin Mitnick, the infamous hacker accused of<br>
            committing several computer-related crimes.  It is hoped<br>
            that the guidelines developed herein for adjudicating<br>
            computer-mediated offenses will insure that the punishment<br>
            delivered is commensurate with the crime. (Approximate<br>
            length: 15,000 words).<br>
