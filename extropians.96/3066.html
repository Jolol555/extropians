Samuel R. Delany played with this in STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND<br>
(1984, independent of Bill Gibson), and it's the default background<br>
experience of my forthcoming Avon sf novel (March 97) THE WHITE ABACUS.<br>
Here's a bit from near the opening:<br>
<p>
A more burly fellow wandered by, just visible within the display.  Despite<br>
the day's brightness and evident heat, he was lavishly clad, from his broad,<br>
heavy shoes to his bulky sleeveless gown, furred in ermine.  I regarded him<br>
with some envy, conscious of my own nakedness.  Under the gown he wore<br>
waistcoat, jerkin, doublet opened at the bulging codpiece. His massive arms,<br>
swinging, moved easily in sleeves slashed and puffed.  It was a formidable<br>
display.  Fashion glosses flickered: Hans Holbein the Younger, Henry VIII,<br>
items of garb orbiting an historic attractor in couture data-space.  The<br>
boy's gaze was fixed upon the spectacle, though not, I began to realise,<br>
with admiration.  <br>
<p>
`Are you all deaf?' he shouted peevishly.  `My luggage!'<br>
<p>
The burly fellow frowned once.  Striding past without moderating his pace,<br>
he smiled through his square red-brown beard at the boy, nodded, glanced at<br>
the luggage, quirked his lips in approval at the fine bags, sent the boy a<br>
companionable wink, strolled on.<br>
<p>
The recorded data stream lost a little crispness as the display widened to<br>
keep them both in register.  The boy was plainly agog at the burly man's<br>
insolent disregard.  I watched his fists clench, then tremblingly come under<br>
control.  He called more loudly. <br>
<p>
`Citizen!  The red singlet!'  <br>
<p>
This time the man paused in surprise, turned, touched his hat, brought it<br>
closer to his right ear.  <br>
<p>
`Morning, petal.'<br>
<p>
For an instant I, too, was confused.  It seemed the fellow wore almost every<br>
garment ever devised for a 16th century European gentleman, one on top of<br>
the other, with the exception of a singlet.  I understood, then, with<br>
something of a shock, that the boy was somehow operating without Gestell access.<br>
<p>
Tsin said at the same moment, `You'll notice, Sen, that the young man is in<br>
vanilla mode.  No aks.'<br>
<p>
The boy stood poised on the balls of his feet, beside his luggage, shivering<br>
with controlled fury.  His voice rose in pitch.  `I have just disembarked<br>
from orbit.  Due to some extraordinary oversight I have not been met.'<br>
<p>
`That was you in the flying brick, was it?'  The burly citizen was polite.<br>
`Why don't you aks for help?'  I plunged into the substrate tuple field,<br>
fetched out his un-augmented appearance.  He was indeed wearing a shabby red<br>
singlet stained under the armpits in sweat, sloppy shorts of an execrable<br>
tartan, and a pair of heavy walking boots.  I let his eidolon covered him<br>
again decently.<br>
