&lt;My perception of the shared extropian belief system (BS) is that there is <br>
an optimism about the future. Not necessarily optimism about the present. <br>
Guatemala? Bosnia? Zaire? Liberia? China? Russia? Urban America? Mexico? <br>
Myanamar? Tibet? Taiwan? Chechnya? Korea? Perhaps this is all part of the <br>
order that leads to the Best of All Possible Worlds.&gt;<br>

&lt;The key lesson is that life continually presents positive opportunities. <br>
Most people miss those opportunities because they err on the side of <br>
skepticism.&gt;<br>
<p>
QueeneMuse noted that they mostly lean toward pessimism rather than <br>
skepticism.<br>
<p>
This reminds me of some of our collectivist comrades on the list: they are <br>
too psyched up with hatred of evil-doers, sharing the poignant trauma of <br>
watching lots of horror shows around the world, getting high on righteous <br>
wrath, not realizing that those places and peoples are really none of your <br>
business unless you do have business there (e.g., fund raising, relief <br>
efforts, actually living there or growing a business there.)<br>
<p>
I'm not saying the problems of the world aren't worth knowing about or <br>
talking about (perhaps, occasionally even joining a demonstration over); <br>
but, tying your personal outlook and alot of your emotions to these <br>
abstract people and places is really a sign that you need to 'get a life.'<br>
<p>
The world has plenty of 'evil', poverty and suffering.  The world also has <br>
plenty of 'good', wealth and happiness.  The dynamic optimist always tries <br>
to eliminate unhealthy emotional dependencies on other people's suffering <br>
by focussing on the positive opportunities, in the process promoting the <br>
wellbeing of others.<br>
<p>
As someone's signature says: "You must be the change you wish to see in the <br>
world." (Gandhi)<br>
<p>
How do you learn the attitude of dynamic optimism?  Well, David Musick's <br>
posts to this list are a good reference.  Basically, though, it must be by <br>
trial and error; by seeing first how unproductive pessimism is, and then <br>
discovering the power of optimism.  Whether our SIs or digital descendants <br>
will still have to learn this, or whether it can be programmed into them, <br>
is a good question.<br>
