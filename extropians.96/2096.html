<i>&gt; That's true, and hard work is also needed to generate wealth, but if I can't</i><br>

<i>&gt; man, I'd much rather just sit under a tree and read a book. Also, there is </i><br>
<i>&gt; no point in me figuring out a way to do things any better than average, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's a waste of time to make an invention, because whatever the invention</i><br>
<i>&gt; is it can have no practical benefit to me. As far as getting ahead in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world I might as well study Turkish love poems of the 14'th century for all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the good it'll do me. You don't have to take my word for this, look at History,</i><br>
<i>&gt; time after time we find dictators preaching, screaming, at his subjects,</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling them to work hard, forget about themselves and do everything for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; state. It never, ever, works.</i><br>
<p>
Hence the decentralization. There is a different atmosphere working for <br>
each other rather than working for some faceless <br>
state/corporation. Plus, with jobs rotated, everybody has the <br>
opportunity to clean toilets, just as everybody has the opportunity to <br>
serve as delegate to whatever conferences of comunities held. If you do <br>
something that you consider important, you'll do a good job. Plus <br>
scientific progress would increase through a better education system that <br>
educates all, rather than those who can afford it.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't find the smallest particle of evidence to support that assumption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is not one person in a thousand I would trade places with in the former</i><br>
<i>&gt; Soviet Union, the same with India, the same for South America, much less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; that for Africa. Since China started to embrace capitalism a little they've</i><br>
<i>&gt; improved their standard of living dramatically, but even so, very few are as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well off as the average American. Spread all that money around however you</i><br>
<i>&gt; like, the average person on Earth will be dirt poor. We desperately need a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bigger pie, and socialism sure as hell won't give it to us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
We may have to alter our lifestyle. Start using grain alcohol, solar <br>
energy, alternative sources of energy and materials. We can use space to get <br>
a virtually endless supply of materials. We can do this because we would <br>
pioneer technologies that are more beneficial, rather <br>
than more profitable. Corporations would stop dumping huge amounts of <br>
grain and waste materials. Once we get nanotech, the possiblities are <br>
endless. Once you get past the waste, there is plenty to maintain our <br>
standard of living for all. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, when you talk about spreading wealth around, it only makes sense</i><br>
<i>&gt; to speak of disposable wealth. Our new rulers could convert the large house of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the owner of a steel mill into an apartment house for his friends, but that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a tiny part of this rich man's wealth, the house is just a wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; absorber. By far, the major part of his wealth in the mill itself, and this</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a wealth generator not an absorber, it makes steel and jobs. What are you</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to do with this factory, tear it down and give everybody a piece of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rubble?</i><br>
<p>
No, you give the factory to those who work in it. The workers no longer <br>
feel alienated, and they can still produce wealth. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Funny you should mention that, I've been thinking of buying a sonic </i><br>
<i>&gt; toothbrush. Feel free to disapprove of me, I intent to do what I want anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yeah, I sort of gathered that.                  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now just hold on a minute, that's going too far, some things are sacred! I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; pray to Saint Ronald and ask Him to forgive you.</i><br>
<p>
Please, beg vindication from the god of overconsumption, where they throw <br>
out enough food to feed a small nation a day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, life is full of choices, some of them unpleasant. I hope I never have to </i><br>
<i>&gt; make the choice between sending my 7 year old child to work in a factory or</i><br>
<i>&gt; letting her starve to death, but if it ever came down to it, the decision </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be easy, if sad.</i><br>
<p>
But you would never have that choice would you? Leave that hard decision <br>
to others, right. Just reap the benefits of that labour.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Soviet Union built many of huge dams. They built them in the wrong place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Soviet Union built the largest steel mills in the world. They built them</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a time when the world did not need more steel. Both projects, and many,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many, more turned into wealth absorbers not wealth generators, but that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; what happens when politicians think they're smarter than the market. How</i><br>
<i>&gt; could it be otherwise?</i><br>
<p>
Your point is...? They wasted wealth in creating stupid media showpieces.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;If a person builds an energy efficient house without taking </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;too much resources from everybody else, we'll be the first </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;to applaud. We won't confiscate it </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As time goes on your ideas are becoming less clear to me. If I'm a harder </i><br>
<i>&gt; worker than you and a better architect than you,  then the house I build will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be better than your house. If private property is not allowed then your claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the great house I just built is every bit as strong as mine, if you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bigger family than I do, then your claim is even stronger and you can take it</i><br>
<i>&gt; from me, or at least you can try, but if you want me to abandon my new</i><br>
<i>&gt; dwelling you're going to need some firepower. I don't think I'm unusual</i><br>
<p>
Maybe you'll have to ask permission to build your house. You can't <br>
arbitrarily go out and use public resources without asking. Not going <br>
through some crazy bureaucracy, but raise it at the next comunity meeting <br>
or whatever. If it doesn't interfere too much, chances are you'll get <br>
permission, and everybody will respect your property rights.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The world you are describing is a fairy tale land, where everybody loves </i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody, nobody is selfish, everybody works hard, everybody is equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; talented, the correct decisions are always made, and most incredible of all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody is always in perfect agreement about what is fair and what is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The advantage of the commune system is that  one can leave and join <br>
another commune that works more appropriatly to your beliefs. Of course, <br>
it's going to be very hard to oppress somebody when they can leave to a <br>
place where they actually have a say. So you'll have a commune of <br>
capitalist owners with nobody to employ. Works for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ever notice that when somebody talks about what is fair, it always just</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens to be to the personal advantage of the speaker. Quite a coincidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll bet a baseball player has never in the history of the world complained</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the umpire " You must be blind! It's not fair, I was clearly out at home</i><br>
<i>&gt; base, yet you said I was safe and that we won the game, you're giving our team</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unfair advantage. We should louse. Your call was grossly unfair you bum! ".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ever notice how the most staunch defenders of capitalism are the ones who <br>
benefit from it the most. Victims of capitalism tend not to support it as <br>
rabidly as the businessmen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That I believe. It's a pity the people of France didn't believe it after</i><br>
<i>&gt; their revolution, or the people in the Soviet Union during The Terror in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1920's, or the people of Germany in the 1930's at the start of The Holocaust,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or the people in China after the Cultural Revolution, or ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The good part is, you can leave, so nobody will <br>
get angry at you. Just pick up and go join someone else before people get <br>
pissed off at you.<br>
<p>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Democracy sucks. Extending it doesn't help.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yeah! Lets have a dictatorship. Bill Gates and Lee Iaccoca are our <br>
rulers! Damn anyone who can't afford to pay for justice.<br>
