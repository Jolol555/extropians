<i>&gt; &gt; Such photos are in existence, and can be accessed in the US Army</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; archives, probably at your local National Archives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, I'll check that out.  Have you been to the archives yourself?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If not, what is the basis for this statement?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am assuming that Michael Shermer gave us his best shot.  If such</i><br>
<i>&gt; photos are in existence, why didn't he publish them in his article?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have read numerous books on this subject and never seen any</i><br>
<i>&gt; photographs of the gassing operation itself.  There are photos of</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything else, but not that.  If they do in fact exist, then, as I said,</i><br>
<i>&gt; revisionism becomes impossible.  That would settle the matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; once and for all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;: Revisionism is possible only because there is a total lack of physical,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;: photographic, or documentary evidence for gas chambers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is a total lie Lyle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course I expected to get this sort of thing... but I didn't expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get it from you, Mike.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I am personally disgusted with people who keep claiming that the<br>
Holocaust never happened. To refuse to acknowledge that such atrocities<br>
happened denigrates the sacrifice of the people who died, and makes the<br>
possibility of their future reocurrence that much easier for those who<br>
would hate. I have always been and will always be for the betterment of<br>
humankind, which demands that we all learn to build a better future by<br>
learning from the mistakes of the past. The existence of the camps and<br>
what was being done was known early on by Jews here in America. Even<br>
Einstein, a well known pacifist, became the father of the atom bomb,<br>
against his highest principles, rather than sit and allow such horror to<br>
continue. The stories they passed on from relatives in Germany were<br>
virtually ignored by the press and the government which at that time<br>
were quite anti-semitic themselves. This is one subject which should not<br>
be under any doubt by people intelligent enough to subscribe to this<br>
list.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If an archeologist examined the camps, not knowing what they were,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it would never cross his mind that the rooms in question were</i><br>
<i>&gt; gas chambers.  To repeat what I said last night:  if there were rooms</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the ruins of Auschwitz that looked like the gas chambers in</i><br>
<i>&gt; American prisons, revisionism would be impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as your own eyes will not lie.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sometimes people see what they want to see.  Some people can</i><br>
<i>&gt; look at the same photographs I look at, and see gas chambers.  Being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; creedal minimalist helps to keep this phenomenon under control.</i><br>
<p>
Take soil samples, as well as samples of the grout in the concrete in<br>
the chambers. An archeologist would do so, find traces of toxic gas, and<br>
with the human scratch marks in the concrete, determine that someone was<br>
gassed there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In our social studies class in junior high our teacher showed us films</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; produced by the US Army at the end of the war of the camps.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; THey definitely showed gas chambers, and showed the gas apparatus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They also interviewed people who were prisoners at the camps who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had been put on details to clean out the gas chambers after use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll check that out too.  There is of course a remote possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the US Army had its own agenda, and was more concerned with</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda than with veracity.  Likewise for your social studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; teacher.  Nevertheless, I will check out all leads.</i><br>
<p>
Why would they be in need of propaganda at that point? we had won the<br>
war...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I started working on this subject in the summer of 1995.  By December,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I had written a 50 page critique of "Proving the Holocaust," in which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; went over every facet of Shermer's article in the same vein as my post</i><br>
<i>&gt; last night.  At the end of my article, I proposed a project, called the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gas Chamber Project, in which I would recruit 50 college students,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they would each write a thesis; the thesis topics would be chosen</i><br>
<i>&gt; in such a way that, taken together, they would cover the whole subject.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My intention was to check out all leads, get all the evidence on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; table, and settle the matter once and for all.  By that time, however</i><br>
<i>&gt; (end of 95), I was sick and tired of the whole thing, and I put it aside.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I still intend to pursue the project.  The idea is not to prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt; gas chambers existed, nor to prove that they didn't exist, but to find out</i><br>
<i>&gt; what happened.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lyle</i><br>
The best way to prove the actual use that they were employed in would be<br>
to take soil samples around the chamber for traces of the gasses used.<br>
The thing that struck me most about the movies that I saw was the the<br>
people who had been gassed died scratching their fingernails into bare<br>
concrete. You can still see the marks apparently, according to recent<br>
trips there by journalists.<br>
