They are under a huge mandate from the pres. and congress to make their<br>
tech. expertise useful to the economy, plus to release pretty pictures<br>
from Hubble to keep the masses entertained (they are nice!).  The Delta<br>
Clipper (DC-X) was originally a concept that Gary Hudson was able to<br>
inspire some engineers at McDonnell Douglas into putting a proposal<br>
together for which they submitted to SDIO, as SDI was in need of heavy<br>
lift reuable capability to put up their dream weapons, which would be<br>
huge.  DC-X was the first demonstrator to test logistical concepts and<br>
powered landing concepts. NASA could never stand it, as they wanted SDIO<br>
to have to go through them for launching. When SDIO got cut back, and<br>
funding ran out, McDonnell went on with testing under their own funding,<br>
and started a grassroots campaign to get congress to force NASA to fund<br>
its development. As a result, the X-33 program was started, accepting<br>
bids from all comers. Even though MD had the only demonstrated<br>
prototype, they got beat out by Lockheed with their Venture Star<br>
Concept, partly because the Venture Star is a "plane", and partly<br>
because NASA was getting revenge on McDonnell by cutting them out.  NASA<br>
will now pay for all the R&amp;D costs and the small scaled demonstrator and<br>
I believe the first full scale prototype, but further construction and<br>
operation will be done by Lockheed alone.  Now that they've been forced<br>
to have competition in the US (Ariane gets ignored politically), NASA is<br>
now accepting bids by private corps to conduct and market all shuttle<br>
operations at a fraction of current prices.  They now want to focus on<br>
pure science alone and get out of the launch business.<br>
<p>
I think that this is probably the first intelligent thing they've done<br>
since the Apollo program.<br>
