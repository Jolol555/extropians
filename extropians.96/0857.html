I believe that an SI is more likely to arise spontaneously than by<br>
design.<br>
Even if the SI arises by design, I don't believe that that its initial<br>
design<br>
will profoundly influence its ultimate characteristics, since  it will<br>
take<br>
control of its own development.<br>
<p>
There is actually a reasonable secnario that would limit an SI to one<br>
star system<br>
but stil make it use up all the resources in that start system. This<br>
will occur if the SI is attempting to maximize is computational speed<br>
and capacity until it achieves some breakthrough that causes it to no<br>
longer have this maximization<br>
as a goal. The payback time for using out-of-system resources is very<br>
long, since<br>
the mass you send out-of-system can otherwise be used to augment your<br>
in-system resources with no speed-of-light delay. Thus, the SI must<br>
choose between immedate use of the mass to build more local computing<br>
capacity, or investingthe mass in a mission to another system to return<br>
more computing capacity later. I feel that the SI may choose to keep the<br>
mass, since at the SI's speed of computation, the return of resources<br>
from another system is an incredibly large number of computational<br>
cycles into the future. <br>
<p>
One technique that an SI may use to speed itself up is to convert itself<br>
into<br>
a neutron star. This puts the mass in a smaller radius, which increases<br>
the<br>
computing capacity by reducing signalling delays.<br>
