From: Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; There are two explanations for the disappearance of European Jewry.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; One is that they were killed in gas chambers.  This is the conventional </i><br>
<i>&gt; view, accepted, apparently, by almost all historians.  The alternative </i><br>
<i>&gt; explanation, put forward by the revisionists, is that they were uprooted </i><br>
<i>&gt; and driven out:  some of them were shot and buried in mass graves, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and many died of disease, starvation, or exposure, but many others, </i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps the majority, emigrated or were deported, and they ended up </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Soviet Union, America, or Israel.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The two explanations agree on everything else.  They differ only on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; question of gas chambers.</i><br>
<p>
This statement is inconsistent with your previous paragraph.  The two<br>
explanations also disagree about whether the missing Jews were killed,<br>
or whether many, "perhaps the majority", survived.  This is a far more<br>
significant difference then the method by which they were killed.  If the<br>
revisionists agreed that the Jews sent to the camps were all killed,<br>
but insisted that it was by mass shootings rather than gas chambers,<br>
the debate would not have much interest and would probably be confined<br>
to historians.<br>
<p>
The real issue is the claim that many or most of the Jews were not<br>
killed at all.  This would significantly reduce the moral culpability<br>
of the Nazis, while casting Jewish organizations and sympathizers as<br>
villains, inventing a horrifying story like this without justification.<br>
I believe that is the real agenda of most of the revisionists.<br>
