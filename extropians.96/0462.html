<i>&gt;I was meaning that sometimes it is good to present one's ideas very</i><br>
<i>&gt;bluntly and matter-of-factly, with no sugar coating.</i><br>
<p>
That does have a good strategic purpose sometimes. I have to say, though, I<br>
usually do it for fun. That's another problem with E-prime--it's harder to<br>
be blunt in E-prime than in English. To point out an offensive equation,<br>
you have to IMPLY it, which seems kind of sneaky and less forceful. As I<br>
say, I LIKE offending people sometimes. For someone who doesn't, this<br>
E-prime thing might be an advantage, and it's certainly an advantage for<br>
noticing one's own limiting equations.<br>
