Eugene, there are a few parts of computer science that *are* real science,<br>
ie. they employ the scientific method properly.  It's those parts of the<br>
discipline that create complex emergent systems that are *way* beyond full<br>
human comprehension, and that then measure them much like one would measure<br>
the world outside in order to substantiate theories by not disproving their<br>
hypotheses.<br>
<p>
Operating systems clearly fall into this category, as do most large<br>
networks and control systems.  Here there is usually an element of<br>
interaction with the external world, which tends to increase the overall<br>
complexity of systems because of non-determinacy and real-time constraints.<br>
<p>
There are also systems studied by computer science that are entirely self-<br>
contained yet also result in emergent complexity that needs to be studied<br>
in the same way as would a physical system.  In this type, there is usually<br>
an evolutionary element, such as in genetic algorithms, artificial life,<br>
neural networks (when learning from a database), and so on.  Sometimes the<br>
systems are not analytic *in practice* because the space of discourse is<br>
too big, and sometimes the reason is that evolution is non-determistic<br>
because of imprecision in computations or by design through concurrency.<br>
<p>
Either way, the only way you have of knowing what's going on is observation.<br>
I did my research in massive parallelism, a decade ago, and it became mind-<br>
blowingly obvious (I was quite shaken to discover) that systems of thousands<br>
of independent but interacting concurrent processes have a mind of their own<br>
that is quite unpredictable ...  In this situation, you have to employ the<br>
usual procedures of science if you are to get anywhere with any degree of<br>
certainty that you are on the right track and not just hand-waving.  That<br>
kind of computer science cannot be done as if it were purely mathematics,<br>
even though in many other parts of the discipline you are entirely right.<br>
