But it doesn't seem that likely we remember all input we receive. While<br>
temporal lobe stimulation or hypnosis may give almost hallucinatory<br>
recall, they have been shown to create our elaborations on memories, not<br>
the actual sensory data. <br>
<p>
One dreaming hypothesis I have heard is that we *forget* during the night;<br>
memories are moved into long term memory from short term memory,<br>
presumably based on how important they are, if they can be subsumed into<br>
other memories (this creates retroactive and proactive interference) and<br>
other parameters. This fits in with the fact that we do not forget data we<br>
memorized just before going to sleep as fast as data memorized before<br>
doing something else (study one hour, take a nap, study some more, take a<br>
nap...). <br>
<p>
Uploading in one's sleep is an interesting idea, and might be useful to<br>
get a good base-state to start with. I have always wondered what happens<br>
if you start up an upload with random activation states - probably<br>
something nasty, the mind seem to be a metastable attractor. <br>
