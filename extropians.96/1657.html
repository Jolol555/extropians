I don't know. When we discussed this, one participant said it was the in<br>
his opinion most realistic scenario, while the present economist said he<br>
found it less likely than the other scenarios. <br>
<p>
There are forces that can brake this kind of breakdown, like the<br>
deliberate delays placed in international stock market systems and the<br>
fact that sometimes governments and corporations do reasonable things (an<br>
almost heretical view on this list? :-) - humans are inventive, and<br>
surprisingly able to find ways to handle many situations. <br>
<p>
We have to admit to ourselves that many of the grand visions we have <br>
actually assume a lot of things about continued economical, technological <br>
and social growth - of which we cannot be sure. So we have to find ways <br>
to get around problems, or direct the changes in a positive direction the <br>
sooner the better.<br>
