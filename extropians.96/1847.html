I described a few things that can be done with made-to-order cells, <br>
to which Howard Julien responded,  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In what way does this differ from nanotech, I don't see the </i><br>
<i>&gt; seperation of mechanics and biology as being meaningful </i><br>
<i>&gt; on this level.</i><br>
<p>
The word "nanotechnology" can be taken in a generic sense, or a <br>
narrow Drexlerian sense.  <br>
<p>
In the generic sense, nanotechnology just means doing things with <br>
replicating atomic-level machinery.  Cells and Drexlerian replicators <br>
both fit this definition.  But they work on different principles.  <br>
Eric Drexler envisions little assembler arms picking atoms up and <br>
putting them in place, one by one.  In cells, atoms are guided into place <br>
by their three-dimensional environment.  If an individual atom needs to <br>
be moved from place to place, specialized molecules perform this task.  <br>
(For example, an oxygen atom would be carried by a hemoglobin <br>
molecule.)  <br>
<p>
It is possible to do the same thing with cellular machinery that Edison <br>
and others did with electrical machinery a hundred years ago.  We can <br>
invent new kinds of microtubules and membranes.  We can introduce <br>
entirely new structures into cells.  We can make trees that grow wood <br>
with graphite composite fibers (or whatever kind of fibers we want), <br>
and these trees can grow to maturity much faster than today's trees.  <br>
<p>
We could start with organisms that already make some kind of three-<br>
dimensional lattice structure (such as corals, sponges, diatoms... ) and <br>
evolve them in the direction we want to go, so they build the structure <br>
we specify.  <br>
<p>
When you start making made-to-order cells, the possibilities are <br>
endless.  I went through all the fantasies about honeycombing the earth <br>
(and much else) back in 1987, but I wasn't thinking about Drexlerian <br>
assemblers, I was thinking about what could be done with modified <br>
cells.  <br>
<p>
The cell is the ideal development environment for the nano-engineer or <br>
nano-programmer.   Most of the tools you need are already there.  <br>
Drexlerian nanotechnologists are going to have to reinvent the wheel, <br>
indeed many wheels.   <br>
<p>
In the secret underground labs of the Evil Twin Cult, we don't waste <br>
our time on  "positional chemical synthesis."  We study the nanoscale <br>
mechanisms that are already there in cells, and then invent variations <br>
on them, and improvements.  <br>
