Sean Hastings asks whether Robert A. Wilson provided the inspiration for my<br>
coining of "extropy".  No.  Nor was I inspired by J. Neil Schulman's<br>
excellent sci-fi novel, The Rainbow Cadenza (1983), which defines the term<br>
"extropic" as "The ascending color scale in lasegraphic usage . . . ."  I was<br>
unaware of Schulman's invention until after I'd independently coined<br>
"extropy".  I believe that another party also independently used the word in<br>
an information-theoretic context, though the exact details of that instance<br>
escape me.  It's a pretty obvious derivation from "entropy", I'll admit.<br>
<p>
At any rate, I drew my inspiration directly from the physics, information<br>
theory, and philosophy.  As 1987 drew to a close, I'd been reading Spinoza<br>
and working on the ideas that I would later set forth in "Wisdomism", 2<br>
EXTROPY 22 <br>
(Winter 1988-89) (soon to appear on my web page in edited form).  On Jan. 10,<br>
1988, I was playing around in my Journal by substituting bits for grams in<br>
standard physics equations, wondering about the parallels.  I hypothesized,<br>
for example, that<br>
<p>
resolution = bits/m^3    as    density = g/m^3,<br>
<p>
and so forth.  By Jan. 11 (I was on a long writing jag) I'd eventually worked<br>
my way through the basics up to entropy.  The rest, as they say . . . .<br>
