<i>&gt;&gt; In what way is biological warfare not coercive?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It does, as you mentioned, violate property rights.  But it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;coercive.  It's not a matter of "do what I say or I'll destroy your</i><br>
<i>&gt;coke."  Nobody is making threats.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  I think that libertarians tend to conflate the concepts<br>
of coercion and theft, probably because of taxation, which is both.<br>
However, that destroying the property of others without a prior threat<br>
is not coercive makes it no more acceptable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;coercive force of the current War on Drugs - "stop selling or we'll blow</i><br>
<i>&gt;your head off."</i><br>
<p>
Certainly if anybody found out that you had destroyed their coca crop,<br>
they would blow _your_ head off, and the law, technology, and all the<br>
transhumans in the world wouldn't be able to save you.  (And if they<br>
didn't get you, the CIA would :-) ).<br>
<p>
It occurred to me that the US isn't waging a War on Drugs -- it's<br>
waging a Vietnam on Drugs.  No wonder they're not winning.<br>
