<p>
IAN: CS manufacturers such as Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, <br>
Wisconsin state in their official company literature on CS, that when <br>
burned CS emits toxic fumes, such as hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen <br>
chloride. The Aldrich company also states that if water is poured <br>
on burning CS, a lethal cloud of hydrogen cyanide can be released.<br>
<p>
Even more, the toxic and flammable agent methyl chloride, used in <br>
Waco to cause the CS dust to become suspended in the air, when burned<br>
releases extremely toxic phosgene gas (Trial transcript: 5735, 5756, <br>
5916, 5921). (BTW, I'm told that the trial transcripts are now on <br>
the web but I do not know the URL, a search should uncover them.) <br>
<p>
There is even an aerial photo of the Mt. Carmel shortly after the fire <br>
breaks out, in which the whole center is in a cloud of white smoke, it's <br>
believed that this cloud is a phosgene-cyanide gas cloud. Both hydrogen<br>
cyanide and phosgene gas were used in the Nazi's gas chambers before <br>
zyklon-B was used.  Waco, TX: Auschwitz USA. <br>
<p>
Also, a report by Amnesty International confirmed that CS and CN gas <br>
had lead to the deaths of over 40 Palestinians, including 18 babies,<br>
who had all been exposed, like the Davidians, to tear-gas in enclosed <br>
spaces. As a result of this report, American manufacturers halted <br>
sales of tear-gas to the Israeli govt (The Davidan Massacre, p.294-5). <br>
<p>
It must be that the CS you dispersed was simply carried up quickly by <br>
the radiant heat of the flame rather than actually burning and thus <br>
releasing toxic fumes. I would imagine that you may still have <br>
had low-level cyanide exposure. <br>
