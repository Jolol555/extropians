<p>
IAN: "If we say it's so, it must be so. The * inside * of the subset<br>
is the area I say it is, no logical rule is necessary." I reject<br>
this truth by decree. I founded my conclusion on a rule:<br>
<p>
        The inside of the box is the area <br>
        that contains all that it is.<br>
<p>
Even better:<br>
<p>
        The inside of the box is that area<br>
        that contains all those features <br>
        necessary for its specific identity.        <br>
<p>
You've not shown me a red box that is what it is free from its <br>
external area. Thus your claim of nonholistic identity, stands<br>
as a myth. Should physical verification be the basis of our<br>
belief or should truth by decree be our standard ?<br>
<p>
But alas, I believe our differnece may be semantical. That's<br>
why I've made a rule for inclusion so as to reduce wheel spinning.<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt;Oh, hang on...</i><br>
<i>  &gt;</i><br>
<i>  &gt;"But all that it is, is all that its not."</i><br>
<i>  &gt;</i><br>
<i>  &gt;Is also a flaw. If the redness of a box is contrasted with the not-redness</i><br>
<i>  &gt;of everything else, that does _not_ make the box not-red. And the same can</i><br>
<i>  &gt;be said of every single feature of the box, so all that the box is, is _not_</i><br>
<i>  &gt;all that the box is not.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: Just as this thing &gt; * &lt; has no identity apart from its external <br>
area, the red box has no identity apart from its external area. Therefore <br>
its external area is * inside * the area that contains all those features<br>
necessary for its identity. I've just unified the red box to the universe <br>
that you errantly assume you've removed it from.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, the red box is "big," "small," "common," "rare," "bright,"<br>
"dark," .... only relative to other items its external area.<br>
<p>
While you've not identified a single feature of the red box that <br>
is derived exclusively from its internal area. I've presented many <br>
examples of externally derived features. Can you find even a single <br>
feature of the red box that is derived free from external relation ? <br>
If not, how do you sustain your claim to nonrelational identity ?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>  &gt; We've had this conversation before, so I'm fairly sure I won't </i><br>
<i>  &gt; convince you </i><br>
<p>
IAN: I stubbornly stick to physical verification as the basis for <br>
belief. I am still waiting for an example, physical or conceptual, <br>
of a nonrelational identity. Until I have it, I'll believe that <br>
identity is holistic and thus the whole universe is the inside <br>
of the red box. Others can base their belief on whatever <br>
standard they choose, I'll stick to physical verification.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>  &gt; (anybody else wanna shout for my corner?), but you continue to suggest a</i><br>
<i>  &gt; binary is/is-not pairing and then suddenly assert that each member of</i><br>
<i>  &gt; that pairing is the same, invalidating your own pair-dichotomy. Huh?</i><br>
 <br>
<p>
IAN: If differnece (two or more features) is the basis for a single <br>
identity (one thing), then the thing is this difference, and thus <br>
is all those things from which this difference is derived. Your <br>
assuming that I deny difference, I do not. Difference is the<br>
basis of what Iam saying. It's a perfect paradox, difference<br>
implies holist unity, implies same, or identity.<br>
