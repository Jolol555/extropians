<i>&gt;Ian's post about terrorism prompted some random thoughts:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, as a matter of my own personal practice, I find it is usually not</i><br>
<i>&gt;fruitful to comment on the weight of evidence in any particular pending case</i><br>
<i>&gt;that has interest to the general public (look at the billions of wasted words</i><br>
<i>&gt;in connection with the OJ Simpson case ...).  This is because both sides in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the actual case have a strong interest in *advocacy* rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth-seeking (that's how the system is supposed to work, after all) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless you're involved in the case personally as party, judge, advocate or</i><br>
<i>&gt;juror, you're unlikely to see anything like a balanced presentation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence.  While a "fair" legal journalist may attempt to present a balanced</i><br>
<i>&gt;subset of the evidence and arguments, taking that journalist's presentation</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a basis of opinion is just accepting her work as a substitute for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;gestalt of a trial.  As we say down here in Tejas, no matter how thin you</i><br>
<i>&gt;pour the pancakes, they always have two sides.  That's why we have trials.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: And there is two sides of a trial, what the Judge allows to be included<br>
and what the Judge does not allow. I think the jury is the true judge <br>
and should have unrestricted access to all information, anything less<br>
is a sham.<br>
<p>
In the Trade Center bombing, the tape recording of an FBI agent telling <br>
the terrorist mole to use real explosives was not allowed, because the <br>
plant, who was later convicted, did not have permission to record the <br>
govt agent. So the fact that the FBI was running the whole bombing <br>
operation is de facto erased.<br>
<p>
In the Waco trial the vast majority of the Davidian's defense was barred. <br>
The prosecution went on and on for a month while the defenses case was <br>
paired down to one afternoon. While the jury still acquitted all the <br>
survivors of conspiracy to murder, the court / judge did all it <br>
could to prevent such an outcome.<br>
<p>
In the Oklahoma case, as I mentioned, the Grand Juror in charge of<br>
evidence said "No one who saw McVeigh with other suspects, [ such <br>
as John Doe #2 ] was ever allowed to testify before the Federal <br>
Grand Jury." That right there tells you that you can't count on <br>
the court for truth. Let's face it, the govt controls the court,<br>
which is not to say justice is 100% impossible - yet.<br>
<p>
And then the govt controls the evidence, and no surprise, they manipulate it.<br>
Gary Spence (Randy Weaver's lawyer) said that in every case he has ever had<br>
against the FBI, it was proven beyond doubt that the FBI had manipulated <br>
evidence. In the Waco case, the FBI "lost" the most important half of the <br>
two sided front door to the Davidian's home, the side which both lawyers <br>
Degaren and Zimmerman said (after seeing it on their visit during the <br>
siege) had only bullet holes going from out to in.<br>
<p>
Former Attorney General Ramsy Clark, who will represent Davidians in a <br>
case for wrongful death, tried to stop the govt from taking away all <br>
the remains and the top few feet of soil at Mt. Carmel, after bodies <br>
were found to have very high levels of cyanide. CS gas converts to <br>
several elements upon heating one of which is cyanide. To no avail, <br>
the govt dug up everything and buried it. Amazing.<br>
<p>
Same story in the Oklahoma case. General Partin pleaded with the govt <br>
not to destroy the evidence by leveling the Murrah building. Determined <br>
to see it first hand, not just detailed photographs, he prepared to go <br>
to the Building, but they quickly leveled it and literally transported <br>
every piece of the remains to a large dump and buried it under 15 ft <br>
of soil, all this before Gen. Partin could even get there. Amazing speed.<br>
The dump was surrounded with a high barbed-wire fence and armed guards. <br>
Gen. Partin was not allowed to set foot inside. The defense had equal <br>
failure in stopping the wholesale destruction of all physical evidence.<br>
<p>
Also this is from the AP printed in The Washington Times (4/10/96):<br>
<p>
        Prosecutors agreed to turn over letters from FBI <br>
        agent Frederic Whitehurts, who tested Mr. McVeigh's <br>
        cloths for traces of explosives. Mr. Whitehurst has <br>
        claimed that investigators faked evidence in the <br>
        bombing case.              ^^^^^<br>
<p>
The evidence that exists, the FBI destroys, the evidence that does not<br>
exist, the FBI creats. The facts dictate that the FBI is an enemy of <br>
truth and justice. How can anything the FBI ever says be believed? <br>
<p>
There's so much more, even in just these two cases. Indeed, books could <br>
be filled with reasons why we can't rely on the outcome of courts, and<br>
thus, why independent investigation is necessary.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Beyond this, the "militia movement" seems far too broad to generate much, </i><br>
<i>&gt;if any good.  Most of its adherents seem to accept unquestioningly that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful state should exist; they just don't like the one they happen to live</i><br>
<i>&gt;in and claim the right to violently oppose its policies.  That's bad medicine</i><br>
<i>&gt;in my book.  Furthermore, there are undeniable racist and fundamentalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;religious currents in the militia culture, absolute anathema to extropians.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: I predict that one day the Militias will be co-opted by the govt and <br>
the "Militia" will be the patrol that wakes-up communities for mandatory <br>
exercises and urine tests every morning. Lots of guys with lots of <br>
guns rarely turns into a good thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)<br>
<p>
Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A<br>
