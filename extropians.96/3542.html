Design problem #1.  <br>
<p>
Suppose you want to build a cell that acts as a refrigerator.  The cell <br>
contains a vacuole within which the temperature can be reduced to a <br>
point near absolute zero.  How could this be done?  What mechanism <br>
could the cell use to pump heat out of a small region?  We assume that <br>
the cell has a source of energy, and that its surroundings can serve as <br>
a heat sink.  <br>
