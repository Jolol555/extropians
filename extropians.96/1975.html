This is obviously the best way to arrange things under the current state of<br>
affairs and I can't see any basis for challenging it today.  My questions<br>
relate only to the conundrums raised by a succesful reanimation (and the more<br>
I think about it, uploads, as well).  Right now you have to be "dead" to be<br>
suspended and claims get paid on "dead" people; no problem.  But if<br>
technology progresses to the point where there is a high probability of<br>
reanimantion for any particular suspended individual, medical ethicists will<br>
inevitably begin to revise their defintitions of "death", though, and their<br>
work has a tendency to make its way into the law.  This is about to happen<br>
now in debates on genetic testing: Articles about genetic testing are<br>
appearing in "mainstream" periodicals like the ABA Journal.  Before long,<br>
there will be cases in court that will give rise to evolution of legal<br>
definitions, etc.  Justice Holmes again: "The life of the law is experience,<br>
not logic."<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  IMHO once you are legally dead, the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;  recourse left for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  creditor is to sue the estate.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I see the issue arising in a claim by a frustrated beneficiary<br>
(Alcor, for instance) or in a suit against a reanimated person by the insurer<br>
to recover benefits: "Hey, you're _alive_!  We want our money back."<br>
