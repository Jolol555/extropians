<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As an engineer, and a software one at that, I would think you'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognize the need for calibration and specification that Lyle suggests,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as the practicality of incremental development.  Too many</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'grand-scheme' or 'master-plan' software development efforts have</i><br>
<i>&gt; crashed &amp; burned.</i><br>
<p>
OK, this is a reasonable response.  Since you accept that MNT will<br>
_eventually_ deliver, we can at least argue the whens and whats.<br>
<p>
The reason why I am a front-line optimist on the MNT rate-of-change front<br>
(but have large concerns about whether we'll survive, which follows from<br>
the rate-of-change argument) is that, unlike the state of the world when<br>
the transistor was developed, today we have engineering and computing<br>
facilities that will collapse the time required to a fraction of the 50<br>
years it took us to develop million-transistor integrated circuits.<br>
<p>
So many technologies are converging to deliver the required engineering<br>
capability that it's hard to keep up.  Every time we look around there's<br>
been yet another DNA sequenced or protein created, semiconductor plants<br>
are driving back the barriers of the smallest features they can create<br>
mercilessly, fuzzy neural companies are increasing the cleverness of<br>
their gizmos all the time, and every man, woman and their dog now has a<br>
top engineering workstation on their desk with the capability to create<br>
any design they wish.  So many thousands of software teams are delivering<br>
full working packages to the public domain weekly as seen in the many<br>
systems/languages announce newsgroups that the capability of the man in<br>
the street is undergoing an explosive increase that exceeds even that<br>
of many a corporate researcher bound by company standards.  We're well<br>
onto the lower slopes of that good ol' Singularity.<br>
<p>
That simply cannot fail to have an impact on the rate of progress of<br>
MNT development, it seems to me.  Many different approaches are being<br>
taken by MNT researchers so it's not a case of all the eggs being in<br>
one basket, and the software design systems can adapt to whichever<br>
hardware route proves viable.  Furthermore, as many people have said,<br>
whichever hardware route succeeds in delivering an elementary building<br>
block, from that point on we can start to bootstrap ourselves out of<br>
the (probably soft) embryonic technology into other forms.  Of course<br>
there are numerous unknowns in this area, everyone accepts that, but<br>
the incredible synergy around right now at such an early stage makes<br>
me think that MNT will happen sooner rather than later.  As others<br>
have said, why *should* it take 50 years, what are people going to<br>
do the other 30? :-)<br>
<p>
Much of the time estimate relies on "feeling" based on seeing what's<br>
happening around us, aided with a sense of what engineering research<br>
is about.  Fair enough, "feeling" differs between people, so others<br>
may be working to different estimates, I accept that.  Given the 20-<br>
year figure though (and that's not just mine, I'm merely agreeing with<br>
the Drexlerian 10-15-20 year scenario), that represents the blink of<br>
an eyelid in social and economic terms, which is why I insist that the<br>
development of MNT harbours not an evolution of social and economic<br>
systems but a cataclysmic revolution.<br>
<p>
Mankind is capable of accepting anything (I believe) as evolutionary<br>
given time, but I do not think that he's going to have the time to<br>
make a smooth transition.  If we're talking about 20 years then there<br>
is no chance at all of evolution in economics --- shucks, most board<br>
members in the corporate world haven't yet come to terms with the<br>
Internet and those nerdy computer things, and they *don't* read SF. (:-)<br>
<p>
The status quo is so strongly rooted in a historical legacy of slowly<br>
changing systems with the institutions of the status quo in control<br>
that there is no prospect of it changing gracefully to meet MNT as<br>
a challange.  Instead, I expect MNT to arise out of a combination of<br>
small engineering concerns, academic research departments, privateers<br>
and the massed ranks of the public domain, and then to suddenly and<br>
very dramatically explode on an unprepared world.  My *hope* is that<br>
it *MERELY* causes the entire economic system to collapse for financial<br>
reasons;  my fear is that it will be far worse than that, and that even<br>
if the biosphere doesn't get converted into goo, many inimical forms<br>
will nevertheless be released, and we may not survive it.<br>
<p>
[By the way, the reasons for the mentioned "collapse" I have already<br>
explained several times, so I won't repeat them here.  No economics<br>
detractor that *does* accept MNT (Lyle doesn't) has yet come back with<br>
any argument at all explaining how current-day economics can survive<br>
without a dependent customer base to feed money through the system;<br>
the message about means of production appears not to have got through.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; IMHO, the scenarios you've suggested would be feasible only for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; stripped-down, 'virtual nanotechnology' simulated in an Artificial</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reality, OR in a world where nanites were already in control of</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything - "an organic/silico blob" / "a teaming, feasting soup" as</i><br>
<i>&gt; some posts on older threads envisioned.  That day may come; but, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're really "more interested in *making* it happen", you should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; working on a practical transition plan.</i><br>
<p>
It's the practical transition plans that are doomed to failure:  this<br>
MNT stuff has no prospect of being developed in a controlled manner,<br>
as it's kitchen-table technology in principle.  Just because we may not<br>
like "a teaming, feasting soup" doesn't mean that we won't get one.<br>
<p>
I don't get the "virtual nanotech" reference.  The elements needed for<br>
MNT to develop along well-explained paths are being created now, today,<br>
in the real world.  Anyone that says it's only possible in virtual<br>
settings have their heads rammed deep, deep into the sand.<br>
