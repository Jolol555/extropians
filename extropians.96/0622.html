Your parenthesis contains precisely the point at issue, as far as I'm concerned.<br>
<p>
Communication is difficult, and if you want to insist on speaking in ways<br>
which you know are easily misunderstood and easily misinterpreted, then you<br>
will get trouble.<br>
<p>
If you want to free these assertions (regarding the statistics of human<br>
psychology) from emotional baggage, I don't have a problem with that. But<br>
if you're sincere about this (and I think it's a very difficult project,<br>
myself), then you'll have to constrain yourself to speak very, very<br>
carefully at all times, or your efforts will be drowned in a rising tide of<br>
hostile (but hardly deliberate) misunderstanding. I know you know what I'm<br>
talking about, because this is what we've seen over and over again in the<br>
past.<br>
<p>
I doubt that the project's benefits are worth the costs.<br>
