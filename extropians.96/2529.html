Yes so you say, but what proof do you have to back it up? The Scientific <br>
Method demands evidence, and in this case you don't have the tiniest particle <br>
of it, you don't even have unscientific testimonials, every one of the fast <br>
uploads says everything is fine and they are the same person they  ever were.<br>
             <br>
Unless you believe in the mumbo jumbo that religion has to say about the soul <br>
(in which case I don't see why you'd be interested in Science or this list), <br>
consciousness MUST be generated by physical means. All uploads are physical <br>
systems, if the Scientific Method can not find a difference between an unload <br>
that is made quickly and one made slowly, then Science says that there is no <br>
difference.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, although the Scientific Method has always worked <br>
wonderfully well in the past, it has never been proven to work all the time, <br>
so this doesn't mean I have proven your theory wrong, I have most certainly <br>
not done that. There are lot's of ideas I can't prove to be false. I can't <br>
disprove the theory that when uploads are made on Monday Wednesday or Friday <br>
the person will survive but if the upload is made on Tuesday Thursday or <br>
Saturday the person will die. That theory and yours have an equal probability <br>
of being true.<br>
