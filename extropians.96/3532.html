<i>&gt;&gt; 1) It didn't occur to Eliezer that FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON is [...] a</i><br>
crafted tragedy which<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; depends for its heartbreaking power upon that conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What?  I don't get it.</i><br>
<p>
Suppose Keyes had allowed Charlie to find a permanent fix to his<br>
deterioration. After all,  medicos have come up with fairly good kludges for<br>
tissue rejection.  The story would then not have been a tragedy, and it<br>
would not have made us cry, and while that would have been a Good Thing on<br>
an extropian analysis (I take it) it wouldn't have made the story famous<br>
either.  <br>
<p>
Your own analysis makes some sense in terms of the difficulty of going down<br>
off  minor peaks on a fitness landscape in order to go up a higher one, but<br>
as I read it you were claiming that  *Charlie's* failure to see the<br>
inevitable transience of his improvement, and maybe even *Keyes's*, was<br>
evidence that he was as thick as a brick, despite his claim of genius.  But<br>
that transience was an authorial contrivance, not a revelation of natural<br>
law - as we can see by considering heart transplants.  Natural selection<br>
frowns on that, too, or at least you hardly ever find it in the wild.<br>
<p>
How do we know that (to take an extreme case) a point mutation doubling the<br>
number of neurons in the cortex might not massively benefit its bearer?<br>
Because it hasn't happened, or if it has happened has proved a hindrance?<br>
That's what Lucy would have predicted, the pea-brain.  I wonder if the<br>
bottleneck (sic), as is generally supposed, has until now been the<br>
limitation on pelvic size in mothers; now that we have C-sections, and soon<br>
will have extrauterine in vitro to term, maybe such a big jump, by chance or<br>
design, will be viable.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 2) It didn't occur to anaesthesiologists that if there were a technique to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; control pain, with no downside, it would long since have occured as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; natural mutation.  Just as well it didn't occur to them.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Controlling pain is a *major* evolutionary disadvantage.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, if by `control' you mean `obliterate'.  But clearly it does no harm to<br>
have women spared the pain of childbirth, despite the religion-blinded<br>
cretins who said it would be the ruin of us all.  So a mutation that<br>
enhanced our control over certain classes of intractable pain would not<br>
(well, might not) be a disadvantage.<br>
<p>
The example I originally intended to post was radial lens surgery.  As far<br>
as I can tell, our population's increasing need for specs after 40 or so is<br>
due to cultural changes in childhood that bugger up algorithms that worked<br>
in our EEA.  All that reading really *does* ruin your eyes.  But mutations<br>
to short-circuit the problem, as we know, might not be selected because the<br>
problem does not kick in until we're past our reproductive prime.  That<br>
doesn't mean that intelligent intervention can't fix things in one fell<br>
swoop.  Charlie didn't have to get stupid again.<br>
<p>
Or am I misunderstanding your Algernonish points?<br>
