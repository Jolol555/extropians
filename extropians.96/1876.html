<i>&gt; Now we've gone from "another" to "a finite number."  Are you sure</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
I wasn't explicit enough here. Consider a really tiny universe, with<br>
four<br>
"atoms", <br>
		ABCD<br>
<p>
Each can convert to one of the next two, ie A =&gt;B or C, B =&gt; C or D,<br>
... D =&gt; A or B.<br>
<p>
Now, each of these transformations is a Feynman interaction, and<br>
allowing<br>
one at a time, we get:<br>
<p>
	ABCD =&gt; BBCD<br>
	ABCD =&gt; CBCD<br>
<p>
	...<br>
	<br>
	ABCD =&gt; ABCA<br>
	ABCD =&gt; ABCB<br>
 <br>
So, ABCD branches out to 8 USS's, and has 8 incoming USS's, but in no<br>
case do we have:<br>
<p>
	AAAA =&gt; DDDD<br>
<p>
which can be done, but not in one step.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again there are lines, plural.  But is this necessary?</i><br>
<p>
It depends. Some states may have no predecessors. For example, in<br>
Conway's Life, the set of all cells being filled has no predecessor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Imagine a grid of dots, some red, some "off".  The red ones represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible states of the universe, the others represent impossible states.</i><br>
<p>
I can imagine a large set of connected subsets which are themselves not<br>
connected. If you start within one of these you may not enter one of the<br>
others. Sources (no predecessors) and sinks (no successors) are also<br>
possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Does the concept "Feynman interaction" still apply to it?</i><br>
<p>
As I recall Feynman diagrams are time invariant, so all interactions<br>
therin<br>
are reversible. However the sense of time requires memory / event<br>
histories<br>
whose consistency supports the arrow of time. I don't know if this means<br>
anything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Does it too have lines leading to other points?</i><br>
<p>
See above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    If so, do all its lines lead to other "off" points, or could some of them</i><br>
<i>&gt;       lead to red points?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    In other words, could you have a situation where each red point</i><br>
<i>&gt;       has more than one line leading into it, but only one of those</i><br>
<i>&gt;       incoming lines comes from another red point?</i><br>
<p>
You can only traverse the USS's connected by allowed transitions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose each red point does have more than one line leading out,</i><br>
<i>&gt; toward other points.  Does it follow that each red point has more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; one line leading into it?  No!  Consider:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let the integers be represented by points on a line.  Suppose numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt; divisible by three are red:  3, 6, 9, 12, etc.  All other numbers are "off."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose each point n has two lines leading out, one going to 3n + 1,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other going to 3n + 2.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Each point has two outgoing lines.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Each point has at most one incoming line.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Red points have no incoming lines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I am presuming a finite universe, ie, the total number of particles is<br>
finite. Ergo the total number of USS's is also finite, though hugely<br>
larger.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  One point to notice here is that every state of the Universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  comes from a large and finite number of possible past states,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  that there is NO single past.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; is far from obvious, at least to me.  Maybe I'm missing something.</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't speaking in terms of mathematical rigor, but from my knowledge<br>
of physics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hope so, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Miracles require absolute forgetfulness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; is too beautiful not to be true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
To echo another thread here, I nearly had an orgasm when I understood<br>
this. BTW, I've had a few personal experiences which though certainly<br>
not scientifically rigorous, fit well with this idea. Also, it is easy<br>
to demonstrate than once there is a miracle, it always has a plausible<br>
causal explanation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [PS  Nadia, are you with us on this thread?  Imagining grids of points,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and having them light up in various patterns and colors, is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; connection between art and mathematics.  Mathematics, when you learn</i><br>
<i>&gt; to see it as it is, is like a laser show in a cathedral full of mirrors.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Your appreciation is sweet to behold. Beauty! = an Extropian<br>
Principle...<br>
<p>
PS - I've done laser light shows for years....<br>
