<i>&gt; He did not show that there was not thrust produced, because he used the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong equation. The sticking point is the mechanism for putting energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the sytem that will not act as an opposite reaction to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; centrifugal force extracted as thrust. I have it, and thats my</i><br>
<i>&gt; secret....</i><br>
<p>
For the love of Pete, why can't you just bloody well say so on your Web<br>
page, instead of sending us off on a wild goose chase?  Just note on<br>
your Web page:<br>
"The key to this mechanism is the method of accelerating and slowing the<br>
circling balls.  If this was done by normal means, the total thrust<br>
would cancel out.  I refuse to tell you how it works."<br>
<p>
Look, Mike, if you can impart forwards momentum to the balls without<br>
disturbing the rest of the system, what the hell's the cylinder for? <br>
Take the damn thing out and apply force to the balls directly, then let<br>
them bounce off a trampoline without this elaborate cylinder thing. <br>
What is all this?  Camouflage?  If you want to keep your drive a secret,<br>
SAY so, don't put up elaborate misleading Web pages designed to make<br>
every physicist within three light years call you a crackpot.  Just<br>
say:  "No, I won't tell you how it works."  Mike, somewhere in your<br>
system there's got to be a module where you impart forwards momentum to<br>
something without imparting an equal and opposite backwards momentum. <br>
If you've got it, the Lorrey Drive is a success, if not, a failure.  As<br>
far as I can tell, your page does not describe such a module.  At best<br>
it describes an unnecessarily complex way of using the momentum produced<br>
by another module and falsely implies that this is relevant.<br>
<p>
No offense, here, but I've read a work on cranks and you're beginning to<br>
show some symptoms.  You publish a device, I say the device has a flaw,<br>
you claim I used the wrong equation, and then when half the mailing list<br>
chimes in you claim that what you published is totally irrelevant and<br>
the secret lies elsewhere.  This is NOT proper scientific procedure EVEN<br>
if you know what you're doing.<br>
<p>
I had the opportunity to become a mathematical crank, once.  I thought<br>
I'd disproved Cantor's Diagonal Theorem by pointing out that the finite<br>
numbers could be placed into one-to-one correspondence with all subsets<br>
of the powers of two, and thought that the Theorem stated it was not<br>
possible.  Then on one fateful day I actually applied the Theorem and<br>
realized I hadn't taken the possibility of infinite subsets into<br>
account, just the finite ones.<br>
<p>
At this point I realized I had two choices.  One, I could decide that<br>
Cantor's Diagonal Theorem wasn't true *anyway*, spend the rest of my<br>
life saying so, plague math professors with poorly typed equations, and<br>
become a general mathematical crank.  Two, I could admit I made a<br>
mistake and get on with my life.  Guess which one I chose?<br>
<p>
Of course, I was, in fact, wrong.  This has been known to happen to me. <br>
Perhaps it has happened to you.  Perhaps it has not.  Certainly I would<br>
not want the billionaire inventor of the famous Lorrey Drive to hold a<br>
personal grudge against me.  On the other hand, I don't want to see a<br>
fellow human turn into a crackpot when I could have saved him.<br>
<p>
In accordance with the scientific method, I hereby propose that this<br>
debate be suspended until such time as Lorrey produces experimental<br>
evidence or six months have elapsed, whichever comes first.  If at this<br>
time Lorrey is the possessor of a Nobel Prize or three, I shall<br>
apologize handsomely.  On the other hand, if Lorrey Inc. *fails* to<br>
drive Boeing out of business, Michael Lorrey shall admit he was wrong<br>
and get on with his life.<br>
<p>
Is it a deal?<br>
