I went to the best magnet high school in Chicago -- the city, not any<br>
suburbs.  I was part of the best academic circle, the most highly<br>
educated.  There was no such pressure.  And your statement had the<br>
slightest semblance of truth, why would so much of the country still be<br>
Christian?<br>

For that matter, Caltech is probably as materialist a university as<br>
exists in the country, and I wouldn't say without doubt that even half<br>
of the undergrad population is not religious.<br>
