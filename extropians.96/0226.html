I'd like to share some of the types of activities I've been doing lately that <br>
are of a self-transformative / learning nature that are also quite fun.  <br>
<p>
	One of the things I do is basically an extension of the type of activity I <br>
was engaged in as an infant and a small child -- testing out my bodily <br>
capabilities.  When I was young, I didn't really know how to use the body <br>
(among many other things), and I just played around, more or less chaotically, <br>
and some types of movements were very enjoyable (such as putting food in my <br>
mouth), and some were painful (such as falling down), and through that <br>
feedback, my neural nets favored the enjoyable types of activities and avoided <br>
the more painful or less enjoyable activities.  But at some point I stopped <br>
learning and experimenting so much because I had learned all the standard <br>
movements for humans in our culture, and was encouraged by the culture to not <br>
deviate too much from the normal types of movements.<br>
	But for the past few years, I've been curious about my body and its <br>
capabilities and about developing highly advanced and enjoyable forms of <br>
exercise.  So, I've resumed the type of chaotic and creative experimenting <br>
which I was heavily engaged in in my very early years.  I will often spend a <br>
half hour or an hour just letting my body move itself however it feels most <br>
naturally inclined to move and watching myself intently, paying deep attention <br>
to how the movements feel, and to all my other senses.  It's been very <br>
interesting watching the types of movements that develop, watching them <br>
evolve.  Because I'm paying so much attention, the types of movements which <br>
feel good or are aesthetically pleasing in other ways tend to get reinforced, <br>
for those reasons.  <br>
	It's a fascinating study for me in evolution and spontaneous order.  It's <br>
also becoming increasingly pleasurable exercise.  The only difficult part (and <br>
the most important part) is learning to pay really deep attention to <br>
everything, but the rewards from that are incredible!  My senses have become <br>
tremendously sharper than they ever were, and my awareness of my own thinking <br>
has deepened, so my thoughts are much deeper and richer and generally more <br>
rational and accurate.  Plus, my body control is increasing tremendously, and <br>
my movements in general are becoming much more graceful and efficient as I <br>
learn to pay more attention to my movements.<br>
<p>
	I'm basically reprogramming my body and brain by just playing around and <br>
letting my aesthetic and other values guide the whole learning process.  <br>
Playfulness is very important to me because it is basically my way of quickly <br>
exploring alternate and very creative ways of doing things, then subjecting <br>
them to the evolutionary, selective pressures in my mind and letting the best <br>
ideas and ways of doing things prevail.  Playfulness is my way of introducing <br>
novelty into the system and testing it out.  And the more I play, the more <br>
confident I am that my most prevailant ideas are really good ideas because <br>
I've given so many different ideas a fair chance to compete.  <br>
	Of course, the more established ideas have a greater competitive advantage <br>
due to being established and not necessarialy to being good ideas, but I can't <br>
see a way around that.  But there is some consolation in the thought that the <br>
established ideas probably have a lot of merit to have become established in <br>
the first place.  Perhaps the most established ideas in my mind could be <br>
considered my core values and that which I identify most with, so it's <br>
probably a good thing that they are more difficult to change.<br>
<p>
	Another fun and interesting activity that I enjoy is sculpting without a <br>
goal.  I  just take a lump of modeling clay (the kind that doesn't dry out) <br>
and just start playing around with it, without trying to make it look like <br>
anything in particular, with no final goal.  I just pay intense attention to <br>
how the clay looks and feels and to the ways my hands can change the shape of <br>
the clay.  I just watch the clay, and  think of changes I can make to improve <br>
what I already have, in simple ways, and then my hands make the changes, and I <br>
continue the process.  I have no goal in mind, just continual improvement of <br>
what I have.  I just play around, and it's very interesting to watch the <br>
shapes that come out of this process.  It's very much like the evolutionary <br>
art programs on computers, but I'm using my mind to think of the possible <br>
alterations I could make with what I have, to improve it, making those <br>
alterations, and then iterating the process.  <br>
	Generally, the shapes that come out are very wierd, interesting and <br>
beautiful.  They are generally very suggestive of many things, but they never <br>
usually look like anything in particular, so the mind can't decide what it is, <br>
but it almost looks like... a lot of things.  The sculpture can be worked on <br>
for an extendend period of time, and generally any time is a good stopping <br>
point, and a good starting point for further modifications.  There's also a <br>
lot of good lessons in this activity on impermanence and non-attachment.  It <br>
also increases the strength and dexterity of the hands and improves hand-eye <br>
coordination.  Plus, I've noticed that it helps me become more clear about my <br>
aesthetic values, since I have to continually use them to decide what changes <br>
to make to the shape of the clay.  And there may be some financial rewards <br>
too, if one gets really good at this and can sell some of the sculptures.<br>
<p>
I hope these activities are helpful to some of you, or at least that my ways <br>
of approaching certain types of things are helpful.  Also, if any of you have <br>
any other good mind training activities you'd like to share, I'd be very <br>
interested and appreciative.<br>
