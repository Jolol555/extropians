From: "David Musick" &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;	There is a meme going around now that has infected huge numbers of people.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;The meme is completely irrational, and it is a meme which blocks many </i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian and Transhuman memes.  The basic core of the meme is: "natural </i><br>
<i>&gt;things are superior to artificial things."  It is quite common for an </i><br>
<i>&gt;advertisement to claim that it's product's greatest advantage is that it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;100% natural.  Not that it necessarily works better than artificial products, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but that its naturalness somehow makes it a better product.</i><br>
<p>
I do not think it is true that "artificial" means "bad" or<br>
"dangerous", but a strong case can be made that many if not most<br>
artifical substances and processes made in the last 50 years have been<br>
released without testing their effects thoroughly or at all, and these<br>
many of these effects have been found to be detrimental.  Cf. "Why<br>
Things Bite Back" for plenty of examples.<br>
<p>
People don't shun GoreTex rain jackets or Polypro camping underwear,<br>
because those things are in a class whose members haven't had<br>
detrimental effects, save a few yeast infections from nylon panties.<br>
People do shun artificial food products because so many of them have<br>
turned out to be carcinogens, mutagens, and so on.<br>
<p>
The solution to this isn't trying to inject everyone with an<br>
"artificial is good" meme, it's to make sure that artificial actually<br>
*is* good.  <br>

I don't think many "naturalists" disagree with self-defense.  What<br>
they disagree with (at least what *I* disagree with, to the extent<br>
that I am a "naturalist") is using living systems as industrial inputs<br>
in the same way as if they were, say, mineral deposits.  And in<br>
destroying these living systems for our convenience and taste, rather<br>
than out of necessity, when there are suitible alternatives.<br>
<p>
I'd rather pay 10% more for recycled paper than to cut down 1000 year<br>
old trees to pulp more cheaply.  If that makes me enemies on this list<br>
(as it did in this lists's early days), so be it.<br>
<p>
If our capabilities are growing exponentially, and we gain only a<br>
constant factor by destroying irreplacable natural systems, why can we<br>
not simply delay our ambitions (e.g., "the singularity") for a month,<br>
and gain entire ecosystems in return?<br>
