<i>                &gt;Postulating a society in which everyone is capable of tuning                 </i><br>

<i>                &gt;basis, I predict the following:  [list of nice things]</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Brin's world would be inherently unstable, so discussing its merits is like <br>
talking about if it would be fun to live in a world where gravity was a  <br>
repellent force rather than attractive. It isn't going to happen. <br>
 <br>
If nobody in the world has secrets except me, that means I know all about the <br>
marketing plans and product development of your company but you know nothing <br>
about mine, that gives my company an advantage, it will grow and so will the <br>
privacy meme. The only way Brin's world could work is if everybody was <br>
exactly like Mr. Brin.<br>
        <br>
On the other hand, if I tell all and have no secrets but everybody else has <br>
secrets, then it is my company will be at a disadvantage and shrink, and so <br>
will the transparency meme. Wonderful though it would be, the world need not <br>
be full of people like me for Crypto Anarchy to work.                   <br>
  <br>
<p>
<i>             &gt;Certainly secret ballot would disappear, but would it be needed? </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
Not really, but then elections aren't needed either, it's a dumb way to let <br>
your wishes be known.<br>
<p>
By the way, I'm not sending Brin a copy of this, he made it crystal clear <br>
that he doesn't want to talk to me again, EVER! That's fine with me.<br>
