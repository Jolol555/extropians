Well, in that case there's nothing to discuss.  By your same reasoning<br>
of course, biological nanotech doesn't exist either, since all those<br>
little organisms that totally pervade the biosphere must have AI and<br>
be directable by you to do anything useful, right? :-)<br>
<p>
[I must say, I doubt if I've ever seen a funnier thought experiment than<br>
the one in which you extrapolate from directors of corporations down to<br>
nanomachines.  Reasoning by analogy is known to be weak of course, but<br>
that example turned it into an artform. :-)]<br>
<p>
I don't know how you reached this idea that nanomachines need to be AIs,<br>
but it seems to have no basis in reality as far as I can see.  Today's<br>
software packages are immensely more complicated than a basic assembler,<br>
yet they do their job very well without being AIs.  As written all over<br>
the place, the first generation of programmable nanomachines is expected<br>
to be controlled remotely by traditional computers, so the nanomachines<br>
can be really dumb, ie. essentially just a nanoscale N/C machine.<br>
Subsequent generations will get smarter of course, but "smart" is a<br>
very relative concept;  for the kind of assembly that most of us are<br>
discussing, all that is needed is fairly primitive state machines for<br>
sequencing and neural networks for recognition --- no AI needed.<br>
