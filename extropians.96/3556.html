This is a possibly profitable enterprise, but it will be very difficult to<br>
get the initial clients.  Most parties interested in this may be too large<br>
to use consultants who don't already have a solid reputation.  You might<br>
consider building a reputation in a related or similar but much more general<br>
field and then kind of slide into the data mining business.  For example,<br>
consider doing database integration and building intelligent integration<br>
tools.  This is a good general consulting business that should generate a<br>
study stream of business if handled properly.  Then after you have<br>
established yourselves as intelligent integration specialists, you can "rub<br>
off" some of your reputation on a data mining aspect.  Also, you might<br>
consider developing a data mining product or tool and promote it<br>
shamelessly.  This could boost your image as consultants if the product is<br>
good.  A single trivial, but unique, product has made a lot of companies.<br>
<p>
This is essentially what I do.  My company does a steady (and growing)<br>
business of database integration, intelligent development tools, and<br>
commerce software for a fairly impressive array of companies.  Since I have<br>
a steady income generated from an existing business clientele, it allows me<br>
to spend some of my time doing the research and development for whatever<br>
projects I deem fit.  This way, I am always able to pay the rent, and when I<br>
come up with new products they are always well received on reputation alone.<br>
Incidentally, one of my chronically unfinished projects and research is in<br>
intelligent data mining tools and context sensitive integration tools.  I<br>
have been inundated with work and will probably continue to be inundated<br>
until I hire some more help.<br>
<p>
I think that intelligent data mining is an extropian technology.  It allows<br>
improved and faster access to the vast sum of human knowledge.  The reason I<br>
was initially interested is that I believed it would allow me to assimilate<br>
useful knowledge faster by weeding out what I already know, or don't care about.<br>
