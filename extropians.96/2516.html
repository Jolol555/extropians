&lt;&lt;Banjo&gt;&gt; i disagree&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Why?  Do you have better alternatives?  Better than. . . Capitalism?<br>
What's wrong with consumer choice and the voice of the people?<br>
Don't you agree with private property?<br>
Or is contract law a problem for you?<br>
Or, tort liability?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Banjo&gt;&gt;where is the proof ?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
USSR (past, and for good reason past), Cuba, China and many other nations<br>
don't let the consumer decide anything.  It's all state controlled.<br>
  Contrast the capitalist countries with these.  Where would you want to<br>
live?  No consumer choice, no property, and only contract law based on<br>
government regulation of business deals.  Who has maximized the social<br>
outcomes more?   I admit the US has increased the fascist-socialist<br>
regulations (private property gun control e.g. Republicans) and the Democrats<br>
have reduced freedoms ways resembling communism  (increased taxation used for<br>
welfare programs).   But then, I'm a Libertarian and can see the US slipping<br>
away from "Ian's maximum social outcomes". <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; how does "maximal social outcomes" coincide with high poverty,<br>
 homelessness, a stuffed-to-overflowing penal system, and as<br>
<p>
Are you talking about the USSR and China?  They are the lowest standard of<br>
living I can think of in industrialized countries.  They have high poverty<br>
and overflowing prisons.  The "homeless" in the US have the highest standard<br>
of living than in "homeless"any other county.  Even Jesus said the poor, they<br>
will always be with us.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Dale Carnegie said a place where "...rich and poor are both free<br>
 to sleep under bridges".&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Dale Carnegie?  Mr. _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.  You are free<br>
to be rich or poor, it is up to you.   <br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;some people don't win in a market economy&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This is not a meaningful statement.  Some people are lazy, stupid or<br>
pessimistic too.    Tell me of a situation were most people win: Anytime you<br>
pay for a product you want more than the money you spend.  For me that's most<br>
of the time.  The fact that I don't "win" every time (Lose-win) makes up for<br>
the times I (Win-Lose).  In general most situations are Win-Win in a market<br>
economy and the standard of living goes up.  You make your own luck and for<br>
some, the standard of living goes down or does so temporarily. <br>

<i> &gt; simply because each individual is</i><br>

<i> &gt; privations. Privations which would not exceed those suffered had</i><br>
<i> &gt; the individual chosen to forgo human association altogether, and</i><br>
<i> &gt; therefore such privations cannot be measured as an initiation of harm.</i><br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;Banjo&gt;&gt; i don't understand.  are you saying that someone who "suffers<br>
material<br>
 privation" (aka Poverty), deserves it.  Is the market equivalent of<br>
 an outcaste or hermit ??&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
If a business is not compelled to serve the consumer,  the consumer will not<br>
(and should not) buy from that business again.  That business DOES deserve<br>
not getting business again.  Call this an "outcaste" or "hermit" business.<br>
 But you don't have much of a business then do you.  You have killed your own<br>
business.  This was not an initiation of harm except self-inflicted.<br>
