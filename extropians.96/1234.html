A modern microprocessor is very complex, yet we can manufacture millions of <br>
them in automated factories. Human judgment is not involved whenever one <br>
logic gate needs to be connected to another, very dumb automatic process do <br>
it for us, that's the beauty of technology and that's why each employee is <br>
enormously more efficient now than he was in past centuries. If we needed <br>
millions of pipelines we would find a way to mass produce them too, but we <br>
don't we only need a few so each time we build one we must design one too. <br>
We design a microprocessor only once, then we can stamp out millions of them. <br>
                          <br>
We know for sure that it's possible to manufacture extremely complex objects, <br>
like human beings, in a process that needs no intelligence in the construction <br>
process at all; it only needs the correct digital information (messenger RNA), <br>
energy (ATP) and simple raw materials (amino acids). There is no reason we<br>
can't make a machine that does as well or better than natures machine, unless <br>
you think life has some mystical vital force that we could never presume to <br>
understand.<br>
