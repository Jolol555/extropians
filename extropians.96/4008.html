<i>&gt;Is it possible to have a system of "rational ethics"?</i><br>
<p>
I think the question is, is it possible to develop a system of rational ethics?<br>
<p>
Let's start from a definition. Ethics are ways of choosing what to do. My<br>
ethics are a set of ideas that guide me in my trade with the rest of the<br>
universe.  Ethics define what is right and wrong for me, and what is<br>
valuable to me. Ethics guide my behavior - or if they fail - they measure<br>
the depth of the resulting conflict. In doing this, they define me, and<br>
reveal me to others.<br>
<p>
It is necessary to my self-determination and self-development that my<br>
ethics are open to question, analysis, experience, and experiment.I learn<br>
from the ethical ideas of others by interacting with them, but no ethics<br>
that I've inherited have been taken for granted.<br>
<p>
Perhaps my ethics could be called rational, but they are not therefore<br>
general, abstract, or universal - which seems to be what people who want to<br>
"develop rational ethics" are seeking. I don't suppose that developing a<br>
universal "rational ethic" is within anyone's capacity. The universe is<br>
just too complex. I view any such claim made by others quite critically.<br>
