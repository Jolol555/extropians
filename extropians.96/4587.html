LC&gt;&gt; Such an exercise might make an interesting document.  Pick a small<br>
LC&gt;&gt; number of propositions; find pro and con advocates; let the advocates<br>
LC&gt;&gt; draft opening arguments, look at and criticize each others, redraft<br>
LC&gt;&gt; them, refine the proposition as necessary, question each other and<br>
LC&gt;&gt; the others' evidence, re-examine the answers and follow up, take<br>
LC&gt;&gt; questions from a panel of observers chosen adversarially, and let<br>
LC&gt;&gt; all of this happen at the level of "discovery" ... &lt;snip&gt; <br>
<p>
LC&gt;&gt; Any resources I can lend to such an effort (my Web site, my<br>
LC&gt;&gt; services as advocate or organizer) are hereby offered.  <br>
 <br>
LB&gt; Ok.  I propose a science court debate about the proposition <br>
LB&gt; "There were gas chambers at Auschwitz and Birkenau."  <br>
LB&gt; The prosecution says there were, the defense says the prosecution's <br>
LB&gt; arguments prove nothing.  I will argue for the defense.  <br>
<p>
That's two different propositions.  I, and any rational thinker, will<br>
concede the latter.  Debating the former might be more interesting,<br>
except that (1) it bears little relationship to anything extropian,<br>
and (2) it's been done to death already.<br>
<p>
The utter lack of valid reasoning on the part of even the most eloquent<br>
revisionists is very easy to spot if one is reasonably well-armed in the<br>
art of bullshit detection.  The fact that they have swayed so many is a<br>
good data point on the importance of proper epistemology, and the<br>
persuasive power of one-sided rhetoric.  Any time this question has been<br>
put forth in an open adversarial process, revisionists were trounced<br>
soundly, as one would expect.  Since this has been done, I would rather<br>
do something new and more interesting, but if, say, you and Mr. Shermer<br>
would like to submit yourselves to the process I describe, I will be<br>
happy to detail it for you.<br>
