<i>&gt;        Perhaps this is foolish of me to ask this of you, Chris, but *why*</i><br>
<i>&gt;would you want people to 'flock to us'?  Extropy is about *not* flocking,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and extropy is by no means a trend --which is what you frequently seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make it out to be.  It is not a 'revolution', it is more of a realization.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is not a faith, it is open-minded optimistic objectivity.  I, for one,</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't want to see extropy portrayed as something it is not...and I'm still</i><br>
<i>&gt;wondering about who you mean by 'us'.</i><br>
<p>
"We" are a group. "We" may be individuals but we are still a group of<br>
people who are looking into the future and will help mold it's outcome. If<br>
you just sit back and isolation and develop memes without spreading them<br>
then whats the point? "We" will still be sitting here as the memes are<br>
rediscovered by others. It's just like that ancient steam-powered greek<br>
toy. We (society) could've had the industrial revolution back in Greece<br>
long ago but the meme's about it's existance weren't spread and thus the<br>
future was delayed many years. We (society) are living in a society of<br>
instant gratification. People do not gently transition over to new ideas.<br>
They want change, and they want it now! Extropy is a process involved in<br>
the continuation of our (society) evolution to posthumanity. Extropy is not<br>
a fad or trend. It will be with us (society) always from this point on. I<br>
just want to accelerate the process as swiftly as possible. We (society)<br>
will get to the future eventually, it's only a matter of time. I don't want<br>
to wait.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Emotional reflex.  If you view what you're doing as an act of rebellion</i><br>
<i>&gt;and overthrowing the Establishment - it's just a guess here, but my</i><br>
<i>&gt;guess is that Chris is doing that - then the first thing you do is</i><br>
<i>&gt;gather some companions so you can overthrow the current chief of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;hunter-gatherer tribes, take his women, and be corrupted by power.</i><br>
<p>
Oh come on! There is no rebellion here. The Extropian movement would come<br>
on like a trend just like the civil rights movement and stay here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why align your life and ambitions with anti-anything! (I do not want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;spend time shooing flock-mongers away from my doorstep!)</i><br>
<p>
I was just considering the thought as to how Marilyn Manson has been able<br>
to attract many people due to himself being a "religious taboo". (Chris<br>
gets off his soapbox) But I still agree that the millenium would be a great<br>
time to spread the memes about a better future.<br>
<p>
"Some people dream about worthy accomplishments while others stay<br>
 awake and do them."<br>
