give myself a "high" that made me want to pursue "novel" (or <br>
perhaps there's an extropian gene) ideas, ways and means?<br>

<i>&gt; Suppose you did have an aerosol.  Imagine inhaling it.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder how the people posting to this list would rate if they were <br>
given a test to determine if they had the 'novelty' gene. I'd guess <br>
pretty high. AND, if there's a 'novelty' gene, there very well might be <br>
an 'extropian-transhuman' gene. This would explain the very real <br>
experience of Chris' 'high' feeling when he gets an 'aha' <br>
feeling/learns/illuminates. <br>
Also, you may not _have_ the gene to be activated. If only one parent had <br>
the 'extropian/novelty/huntington's chorea' gene, you might not receive <br>
it. Even if they both had it, you might not receive it. So no matter how <br>
many aerosols, patches, plug-ins you had, you could never activate that <br>
gene.<br>
Getting that gene from somewhere else and injecting it to provide your <br>
body with the biological assistance it was incapable of giving you, is a <br>
current technology. Only, this technology is being used to treat disease <br>
and not for any 're-creational' or 'cosmetic' purposes.<br>
	Is it possible, right now, to use this technology for purely <br>
cosmetic purposes? <br>
<p>
New ideas will come so fast<br>
<i>&gt; you can't write them down.</i><br>
<p>
I'm thinking about longevity, so I _can_ write them down (and research <br>
them, and write about them and realize them.)<br>
