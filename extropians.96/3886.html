<i>&gt; In these criticisms of belief in "the Singularity," I can't help be curious</i><br>
<i>&gt; *which* idea of singularity is being criticized.  Anders, Max and Shaun,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for instance, seem to be talking about some wildly optimistic, "let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; sit back and wait for Santa" version.  Well, singularity isn't singular.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just which ideas under this umbrella do you all have problems with?</i><br>
<p>
As I see it, the main problem isn't the ideas under the umberella, but <br>
that people often seem to stop thinking clearly when faced with the <br>
enormity of the concept; it fits in too well with our memetic receptors!<br>
<p>
The most common versions of the Singularity are the Transcension (we <br>
become something Compltely Different and Unknowable), the Inflexion Point <br>
(the inflexion point on the huge sigmoid of progress) and the Prediction <br>
Horizon (the time beyond which we cannot predict or understand much of <br>
what is going on). <br>
<p>
The Transcension is the most dangerous of them, since it is the most <br>
overwhelming. Many discussions just end in "But we cannot predict <br>
*anything* about the post-singularity world!", ending all further inquiry <br>
just as Christians do with "It is the Will of God". And it is easy to <br>
give the Transcension escatologic overtones, seeing it as Destiny. It <br>
also promotes a feeling of helplessness to many, who sees it as powerful <br>
and inevitable.<br>
<p>
As for the question of whether Transcension is possible or not, I'm a bit<br>
agnostic (as can be witnessed by my essay about the limits to the<br>
singularity on my web page) but I do not rule it out. But it is just one<br>
possibility of many. <br>
<p>
The Inflexion Point is fairly benign, almost depressing (What? No eternal <br>
exponentials?!). At most, we can argue about where on it we live, and how <br>
high it is.<br>
<p>
The Predicion Horizon is somewhat similar to the Transcension - it is easy<br>
to use to stop rational inquiry, but doesn't have the millennial<br>
overtones. We must remember that even very advanced beings are bound by<br>
the laws of physics! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since my idea of Singularity is one of alarm, of "agonizing reappraisal,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; as they said in The Shockwave Rider, I wonder whether, when people say</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Singularity won't happen, they mean I should relax.</i><br>
<p>
We should relax even if the Singularity was imminent - it is healthy. All <br>
forms of accelerating change bring alarm and disruption, and the <br>
Singularity will definitely bring that. But it may also be enjoyable, or <br>
most likely terribly diverse.<br>
<p>
I'm reminded of the scene in Terry Pratchett's novel _The Light Fantastic_<br>
when the protagonist encounters people fleeing into the mountains as a<br>
huge red star is about to crash into the world and destroy it: "But you're<br>
not safe there either!" "No, but the view is better!" <br>
