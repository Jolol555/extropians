<i>&gt; &gt;existence. It will then get more intelligent as a result of increases</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in the capabilities of its computer part. So far, no feedback is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;involved. Then it will get rapidly more intelligent as it uses this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intelligence to better use its computer part. The major difference</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;here is that the computer will contribute directly to the intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the entity. I claim that this is different in kind than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;contributions to intelligence of the other technologies you cite.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I really have no idea what you mean by a more intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; "human/computer joint entity", if you deny that computers now</i><br>
<i>&gt; contribute to human intelligence in the way you have in mind, if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; also deny that a larger group of people with more access to knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; is effectively more intelligent in your way, and if uploading (mere</i><br>
<i>&gt; porting of human software to faster hardware) doesn't count.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
IMO, a large group is not much more intelligent than its most<br>
intelligent member. True, the most intelligent member may be<br>
somewhat more effective if the group can off-load some of the<br>
more mundane parts of the creative effort, but the effect is<br>
not large, and in many groups the effect is offset by the effort spent<br>
in communication among the group.<br>
<p>
IMO easy and effective access to knowledge is an intelligence<br>
multiplier. the best you could do in this regard prior to the advent of<br>
the computer was to live in a library. Even that was not very good.<br>
<p>
Uploading does count. However, I don't feel that the argument is<br>
restricted to uploading. Therefore, I attempted to make an abatract<br>
argument.<br>
<p>
My favorite scenario is the use of a modern video interface and<br>
effective software that lets a human make decisions<br>
at a very high rate based on information presented by the computer.<br>
the human's input would affect the computer's output to the human.<br>
the human's decision rate can be very high in such a scenario, even with<br>
fairly restricted human-to-computer commnications: watch a kid playing a<br>
flight-simulation game to see what I mean. The I/O hardware is alrady in<br>
place: what's missing is the software. <br>
<p>
So at one end of the spectrum is uploading. At the other is the<br>
existing hardware with new software. In either case, we get a<br>
human/computer collaboration whose intelligence is substantialy<br>
augmented by its computer component. "Intelligence" for the purposes of<br>
this discussion is very(!) narrowly defined as the<br>
quality that permits an entity to design and implement newer and better<br>
computer hardware and software.<br>
<p>
The "SI Dream" scenario is a researcher (probably a grad student at MIT,<br>
drinking Jolt cola at 2AM and programming when he should be studying for<br>
an English exam.) The researcher is attempting to enhance a<br>
decision-support system by interfacing it to a knowledge base and to a<br>
graphical information-presentation system. Because the researcher is<br>
interested in software development, the knowledge base is the one he set<br>
up last year as a class assignment in his software engineering class. He<br>
gets the system up, and (since he is currently working on this system)<br>
his first trial run is an attempt to optimize his prototype. He<br>
succeeds, and installs the<br>
next version. With this version, he optimizes the operating system<br>
(He's using LINUX, so he has the source.) Next, he optimizes his<br>
hacking program. Then, he grabs all the workstations in the dorm, via<br>
the net, and oprimizes them. Then, he reoptimizes his program to run in<br>
a distributed mode. Now (about 4AM, I think,) he<br>
hacks the campus routers, and then all computers on the campus,<br>
and then the web. He turns his attention to extending his knowledge<br>
base, probably by hacking The CYC database. By 6AM, he's running<br>
in the whole Web. By the end of the trading day, he owns a controlling<br>
interest in a nice collection of companies on the<br>
NYSE.<br>
