<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If one looked at the inards of a very advanced computer, then if one</i><br>
<i>&gt;intercepted a "long" communications channel, where the cost to</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmit was large compared to computation costs at either end, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;yes it should look like random noise relative to a high entropy state</i><br>
<i>&gt;of that channel.  But this observation is a long way from showing that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the innards of this computer should look like the stars and dirt we</i><br>
<i>&gt;see.</i><br>
<p>
Well, right, that's even less than circumstantial.  Motive and method<br>
are also needed.  I'm saying the motive is just that hiding is necessary.<br>
Whether there's a possible method...because we're talking<br>
about civilizations more advanced than our own, we can only ask, can we<br>
prove that it's *not* possible to be computing with (what looks like)<br>
dirt?<br>
<p>
By the way, in case I wasn't clear, it isn't that dirt, or any of our<br>
particular surroundings, are what I would expect to see.  "Dirt" is just<br>
my code word for whatever science would lead us to expect are natural<br>
things to see at this stage in the evolution the universe.<br>
<p>
If looking like "dirt" is a great advantage, and it's possible,<br>
then I would expect advanced civilizations to look like dirt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As you point out, all that sunlight streaming away seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;inefficient.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  But maybe that's just the cost of hiding.  Our civilization is<br>
certainly paying the same price without much complaining.  Or, and this<br>
is something I've been thinking since, sunlight may be the dumping of<br>
waste heat.  A little more on thermodynamics below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd expect an advanced computer to notice if some external force</i><br>
<i>&gt;started to muc[k] around with its innards, and to do something about it.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, "route around it," in John Gilmore's immortal words.  "To see<br>
the internet in a grain of sand..."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So if the world around us is an advanced computer, it knows about us</i><br>
<i>&gt;and chooses for some reason to allow our activities to continue.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Either we are part of this computation, or it works around us.</i><br>
<p>
My assumption is that our activities are so gross and slow that they<br>
pose no problem.  Even we humans know how to do distributed computing,<br>
redundancy, moving running processes between processors, etc.  Anyway,<br>
I think we would be part of the computation, whether intended<br>
or noise or bugs.  We don't seem much more troublesome than, let's say,<br>
rainstorms, though.  How to compute with dirt seems much harder than,<br>
"Given I can compute with dirt, what if it gets up and walks?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How much physics do you know Steve?</i><br>
<p>
    "...Clever people may learn as much as they wish of the results of<br>
     science--still one will always notice in their conversation, and<br>
     expecially in their hypotheses, that they lack the scientific<br>
     spirit; they do not have that instinctive mistrust of the<br>
     aberrations of thought which through long training are deeply<br>
     rooted in the soul of every scientific person.  They are content<br>
     to find any hypothesis at all concerning some matter; then they<br>
     are all fire and flame for it and think that is enough...  If<br>
     something is unexplained, they grow hot over the first notion<br>
     that comes into their heads and looks like an explanation..."<br>
     --Neitzsche<br>
<p>
Say, college freshman level, polluted by popular accounts.  Including<br>
doing my best to understand things like thermodynamics, information<br>
theory, and reversable and quantum computers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure you realize how very</i><br>
<i>&gt;much we do know about all that information streaming around us.</i><br>
<p>
Well, not enough, but tell me the fastest-reproducing human cell and<br>
I can compare it to a writable CD-ROM drive...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We</i><br>
<i>&gt;know which systems are exchanging bits with each other, and how fast,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and where this arrangement changes, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Wow, do we?  How does it compare to the computing cost of *simulating*<br>
events at the quantum level, or even at the classical-physics level of,<br>
say, folding proteins?  I know no single number completes the picture--<br>
my point is, it's the *amount* of interaction at various scales that's<br>
interesting, and I was under the impression that our computers have many<br>
orders of magnitude to go before we even start to dent that.  Plus, our<br>
computers are a pretty small fraction of the mass of the solar system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  We also know a lot about</i><br>
<i>&gt;designing computers, carefully arranging the routes and speeds of bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;exchanges.</i><br>
<p>
Whoa.  Computers I know.  It is 1996 and almost all computers have single<br>
processors with clocked logic.  One thing we know is that neither of<br>
those design choices are necessary.  Sure, we know "a lot," but how much<br>
do we know about what all computers *must* look like, under all design<br>
constraints--especially the dirt constraint?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And these two really look nothing alike!  We can see</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature's circuit diagram, even if we don't know what the bits</i><br>
<i>&gt;"encode".  In particular, we can see the "short" communications</i><br>
<i>&gt;channels, where we have no strong reason to expect noise-like bits.</i><br>
<p>
Unless (sorry to repeat) it's strategically necessary to design things<br>
that way.  It might be fun to try to come up with a method for designing<br>
logic circuits where every signal looked as noisy as, say, a feedback<br>
shift register.  By the way, it's looking natural that's the constraint,<br>
not looking like noise.  Orderly or stereotyped patterns--say, the<br>
recurrance of atoms in the periodic chart--are part of looking natural.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an</i><br>
<i>&gt;optimum design for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.</i><br>
<p>
So I hope I've made my point that you have to look at the driving game<br>
theory, not just 20th century notions of computer design.  If hiding is an<br>
absolute constraint, then efficiency is secondary.  If the most important<br>
measure of "optimum" and "advanced" is whether something looks natural,<br>
dirtlike, then whether it looks "crazy" is also secondary.  Heck, almost<br>
necessary.  Just look at the way bits flow through an encryption algorithm.<br>
[I will not say, "Yeah, crazy like a fox!" as this would spoil the<br>
paragraph.]<br>
<p>
I think the right point of view is to look at how much information<br>
is sitting, colliding and moving free at each scale level, and then take<br>
that as the given and design a computer and software (if the two must be<br>
distinguished) to make use of it.  When you're done you know how much<br>
computing you can do--and you (the great intergalactic empire) live with<br>
it.  Them's the breaks, we can't compromise security.  In computing there<br>
are often ways of making use of speed *or* storage space, according to<br>
what's available.  Also ways of trading speed for thermodynamic efficiency.<br>
I imagine aliens with billion-year patience would have extra slack here.<br>
<p>
There are also strange tradeoffs in crypto.  Like Chaum's cash protocol<br>
where you can spend money once anonymously, but if you spend it twice you<br>
reveal yourself.  Imagining much more advanced crypto calls into question<br>
what we know about the kinds of computing that need to be done, and also<br>
simple game theory.  For instance, imagine it was possible to cause<br>
something to happen, but not know where it happened.  What would that do<br>
to notions of territory?<br>
<p>
The thing I wanted to say about thermodynamics is that calculations of the<br>
kind of computing and communicating you can do depend on the background<br>
noise, or temperature.  When trying to figure out how much computing dirt<br>
or stellar plasma is doing, there is a problem: are those particle<br>
motions really random?  To what extent?  If someone could throw off the<br>
motions they didn't want and replace them with motions they intended, then<br>
the effective temperature for the users and outside observers would be<br>
different.  That would change how much computing would seem possible.<br>
<p>
(The other cryptocosmology quip: "God is in the least significant bits.")<br>
<p>
I don't know whether physics would let this kind of temperature<br>
difference exist for long, or at what cost.  Imagine (metaphorically)<br>
extremely cold parts moving extremely fast in an extremely well-designed<br>
machine.  Does physics let you keep that up without friction "melting the<br>
parts" quickly, even with refrigerators?  Even with, say, big systems in<br>
known quantum states (setups too perfect for us to imagine making)?<br>
<p>
The sun's light might plausibly be refrigerating the sun.  Not so plausibly<br>
the planets.  Of course sunlight can power planetary refrigerators, but so<br>
few of those BTUs are falling on planets.  This really makes suns<br>
look like the place to compute, except that plasma is even more unruly than<br>
people (or is it?).  Maybe planets are very very slow mass storage, doing<br>
processing only in order to store and retrieve and refresh.  But then there's<br>
that nice single crystal of iron that forms the solid core of the earth...<br>
<p>
Planets and suns both seem to have it over interstellar gas and dust because<br>
they're compact, but considering what I said about speed/storage tradeoffs,<br>
and also all that mysterious free-range sunlight, there could be something<br>
going on there.<br>
<p>
If we want to think about advanced civilizations, I think we need<br>
to recognize what a wildcard that "advanced" is.<br>
Cryptocosmology says They might need to evade probes like science.<br>
At best we can ask whether computing is possible in "dirt" *as we know it*.<br>
If not, the Great Filter has more plausibility.<br>
If so, there's a giant "OR...NOT" thrown into the picture, with no<br>
probability assigned at this point, but it would make some questions<br>
in crypto and game theory more interesting.<br>

P.S., Do you think it would be clearer if I said "Stegocosmology?"<br>
