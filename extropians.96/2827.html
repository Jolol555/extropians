The sort of uploading that interests me, would be to keep my body<br>
but use nanotech to improve and augment.<br>
<p>
Could each neuron be rebuilt to run faster ?<br>
And store huge libraries and complex programs built into my skull,<br>
collar bone or pelvis ?<br>
Nano-bots reparing cell damage ?<br>

Im a busking songwriting banjo player, i'd love to be able to call<br>
up a songs' score, and be able to hold thousands of songs in my head.<br>
To have the tools that i have on my PC intuitively accessable inside<br>
my own head would be great.<br>
<p>
I love being a human, and have no desire to upload myself just upgrade.<br>
