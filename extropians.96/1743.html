<i>&gt;        I agree.  We should think things out before we do them.  Refine</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential before it is made kinetic.  For example, to use a story we all</i><br>
<i>&gt;know, look at "Frankenstein".  That is really a transhuman novel.  If only</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dr. Frankenstein had thought things out a bit better before he 'created a</i><br>
<i>&gt;monster', then he might have discovered a way to create a rationally</i><br>
<i>&gt;functioning, intelligent human being.  Not to confuse fiction with fact, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;mental progress is as important --if not more so-- as kinetic progress.</i><br>
<p>
I am not of your particular mindset I suppose. I would rather come across<br>
stumbling blocks along the way and actually make progress than discuss it<br>
till it dilutes the original point. In the movie Jurassic Park I sided with<br>
Hammond, owner of the park in that I believe in acceptable losses or<br>
inevitable screwups along the way as opposed to Iam Malcom, the chaotician's<br>
(sp?) mindset where "The scientists were so busy wondering if they could,<br>
that they forgot to think if they should." We can refine forever and nothing<br>
will ever occur, or at least we'll get free rides from the people who<br>
actually make it happen but then we're about as worthless as entropians<br>
fighting progress. There is NOT ENOUGH TIME to sit here and think it all<br>
through. ACT NOW! I think it is mutually understood that everyone on this<br>
mailinglist wants the future ASAP! What ever happened to "go get 'em"<br>
dynamic optimism? It appears it has become a "let's all sit on our asses and<br>
be optimistic" optimism. We're drowning in a stagnant pool of our own ideas!<br>
It's time for a little variety people! Time for new blood.<br>
