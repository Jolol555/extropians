Ah!  Thank you!  I thought it quite likely that there would be some good<br>
analogy between physical integrity and privacy -- intellectual integrity<br>
-- but I couldn't quite pin it down.  Yes, overall productivity could go<br>
up if all ideas were globally shared.  If it was accomplished through<br>
some 'telepathic' way, we would become a group mind, possibly with<br>
little nodes of ourselves still left, possibly not.  I don't want that.<br>
Why?  Because I'm selfish.  Why?  Because being selfish maintains<br>
myself.  Why do I want that?  Because I'm selfish.  A universal property<br>
of all life.  Amoeba are selfish in working to maintain a chemistry<br>
distinct from their environment; a global group mind would also be<br>
selfish, at least if it wanted to stay a coherent mind.  But I was here<br>
first.  No group mind.<br>
<p>
What is actually practicable is not nearly so extreme -- just a sharing<br>
of all information at an external level, with thought still private.<br>
(Until the real-time EEGs get cranking.)  And at least as important and<br>
functional as privacy in this respect is the ability to keep information<br>
and influence _out_, rather than in, which would not even be threatened<br>
by the EEGs.<br>
<p>
But as partially stated before, my inductive instinct says that I'm<br>
more likely to run across a good justification for privacy sometime<br>
rather than a solid argument for giving it up.  And risk sense seems<br>
to tell me that the weighted cost of being wrong having given up privacy<br>
is rather greater than the cost of not giving up privacy 'early enough'.<br>
So Brin et al. will have a strong barrier to overcome.<br>
