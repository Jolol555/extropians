Recently I was in Newport Beach when I noticed cameras placed on the top of<br>
mini-malls that sense and focus in on rapid movement. It kinda freaked me<br>
out because I'm not used to motion tracking cameras, but I wondered if<br>
having cameras everywhere owned by private industry is really such a bad<br>
thing? Cameras in the home is definately a no-no but in public areas it<br>
could be acceptable and even prove that someone didn't commit a crime such<br>
as murder. It's much better than all the cameras being controlled by the<br>
gov't. Could adding cameras everywhere decrease the amount of crime in a<br>
given area if people knew they were being watched constantly in public<br>
places? No single person will have power over all the cameras and therefore<br>
it is safer because many different shops and stores would own them and keep<br>
them in working order. You could possibly even hook them up to the net<br>
eventually and allow people to spot crimes themselves when the shop owners<br>
are turned away from the moniters helping customers. Also with the advent<br>
of augmented reality in a design where you would wear glasses with a camera<br>
that would redisplay the incoming image on 2 tiny screens to allow for<br>
multi-spectral vision, your point of view could jump from person to person.<br>
Imagine watching a football game where your point of view would jump to the<br>
person closest to the action. Or better yet have a camcorder where whatever<br>
you see, the camcorder will record in stereoscopic through your eyes<br>
allowing visual/audio recordings of memories like in the movie "Strange Days".<br>
