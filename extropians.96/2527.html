IAN: You claim that it's "not 'the voice of the people'," <br>
yet you've not presented an argument to support your claim.<br>
<p>
You make the claim and then observe that people with money have <br>
influence. True enough. You then seem to concede my observation<br>
in part, that it's the "voice of people who count."<br>
<p>
But after all this, my point that the allocation of capital in <br>
the market is the voice of the people, still holds. The "people<br>
who count" are the people who the people vote for, the people <br>
who the people count on. <br>
<p>
I vote for those who most effectively service my needs. A cruel <br>
task master am I. My ballots are limited only by the degree to <br>
which I do or do not service the needs of others. Democracy <br>
cannot possibly give all candidates an equal share of the <br>
votes, such would be the logical abolition of the demo-<br>
cratic process, and yet that's exactly what the soc-<br>
ialist yearns for.<br>
<p>

<i> &gt; Oh, great, and The Words of God(tm), are a good basis for dealing with </i><br>

<p>
<p>
IAN: We'll just wave our magic wand -- utopias for all <br>
and for all a central planner. The wonders of magic.<br>
<p>
It occurs to me that I presented you with evidence that your anarcho-<br>
socialist ideas required central planners, and you never presented <br>
a logical argument to defeat that point, in fact I think you just <br>
avoided it.  Nevertheless, here you are plowing full steam ahead <br>
with your illogical utopias. This therefore forces me to toward <br>
the conclusion that your not an honest but a magical thinker.<br>
Did I miss your counter argument?<br>
