<i>                &gt;What was uploaded was your memories, thoughts, etc.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I see where our fundamental disagreement is. You say we have memories, <br>
thoughts and feelings; I say we ARE memories, thoughts and feelings. You say <br>
we are an object, a noun. I say we are an adjective, we are the way matter <br>
reacts when it is organized in certain ways. True, matter is needed for us to<br>
exist, but that's not the important part because any matter will do, good <br>
thing too, the matter in your body is quite different than it was a year ago. <br>
The important thing is the way the matter is organized, the information.   <br>
         <br>
Information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the soul  <br>
and still remain within the scientific method.  <br>
Consider the similarities:<br>
<p>
1) The soul is non material and so is information.  <br>
<p>
2) It's difficult to pin down a unique physical position for the soul, and <br>
   the same is true for information. Exactly where is the location of the <br>
   information that Caesar was a Roman or that 2 +2 =4 ?  <br>
<p>
3) The soul is the essential, must have, part of consciousness, exactly the <br>
   same situation is true for information.  <br>
<p>
4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.  <br>
    <br>
<p>
There are also important differences between the soul and information:  <br>
<p>
<p>
1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  <br>
<p>
2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable, but information is <br>
   understandable, in fact, information is the ONLY thing that is <br>
   understandable.<br>
<p>
3) Information unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that,  <br>
   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.<br>
                                                            <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                   &gt;your thread of consciousness still remains in your brain. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
To say that consciousness is in our brain is like saying speed is in a <br>
particular racing car and if we just look close enough we'll find it lurking <br>
someplace in the machinery, thus another car moving at the exact same <br>
velocity  must nevertheless have a different speed because the same speed <br>
can't be in two places at once. Obviously this doesn't work, I realize speed <br>
is just a scalar and mind has a huge number of variables, but if it doesn't <br>
work in the  simple case making it more complex won't help.  <br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;All you are doing by uploading is spawning a second thread </i><br>
<i>                &gt;of consciousness that thinks it is you.                  </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
So I don't really survive I just think I do? That's good enough for me <br>
because  if I think I've survived then I have. It's like those old Twilight <br>
Zones when at the end the hero is horrified to discover that he's really dead, <br>
even as a kid I never understood that, I'd be astounded and delighted to <br>
discover I was dead because that would mean death wasn't all it was cracked<br>
up to be.             <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The uploaded brain would have every reason to think it was                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;you because every memory tells it that it is you.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Yes, the upload would certainly believe that he was you, and I can find no  <br>
reason to think he would be wrong.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Your human brain (and consciousness) would walk away and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;continue to evolve on its own thread. Your uploaded brain                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;would also continue to evolve, but on a separate thread of                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;consciousness.</i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Yes, very soon the two would start to diverge because of random factors and <br>
the fact that they would receive different input data from the environment, <br>
but that doesn't change the fact that at the instant the second original was <br>
made the two were identical. I should add that every day things happen to you <br>
that make your consciousness evolve in a completely different direction than <br>
it otherwise would, and this has nothing to do with copies.  <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by this. Information can be copied and information <br>
can (probably) be destroyed by sending it through a non reversible computer <br>
or dropping a floppy disk into a Black Hole. If information no longer exists <br>
at point A but now exists at point B it sure sounds to me like it moved.    <br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The problem with the human brain is that we are more or less                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;locked into the architecture that biology gave us. Even if                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;we replaced every neuron with optical switches, we would                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;still be limited by the architecture. It would be like                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;running a '286 computer at 500MHz. Fast, but very limited. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
The easiest way to do an upload is the paint by numbers approach, replace  <br>
each neuron with something much smaller and faster. To do this you'd need to <br>
have a good understanding about neurons operate but you wouldn't need to know <br>
how the brain as a whole operates. As you point out this is very limiting, <br>
a billion fold increase in speed and immortality is about all we could expect <br>
from it. To design something better we'd need to understand how intelligence <br>
operates, and that could be enormously difficult. It could take uploads  <br>
100,000 years of vigorous research to figure it out, that's about an hour <br>
in our time. <br>
