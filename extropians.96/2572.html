<p>
Somehow, this silent assumption of physical love-making has crept into my <br>
reasoning, as default... It seems I have underestimated the fraction of the <br>
upload illuminati in here, obviously apologies are due.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We can understand that "mind" itself can experience</i><br>

<p>
Ok, so you're already considering reward centre stimulation, <br>
something resembling these ancient rat autoelectrostimulation <br>
experiments. No flabby flesh physics to simulate, agreed. <br>
<p>
But even this version is still obsolete, methinks.<br>
<p>
(Btw dreams involve all the body representation systems, just inhibiting <br>
the actual motorics. I think uploads have to forsake such things <br>
relatively soon).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; in flesh form to trade the impulses, electro</i><br>

<i>&gt; of the pleasant, visual "fireworks " of orgasm or</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasureable contact? In this case I wonder if you</i><br>
<p>
No detailed sensoric body maps, just a fuzzy reward glow, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; are missing the point entirely of being "uploaded".</i><br>
<p>
Indeed ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The idea of uploading assumes computational </i><br>
<i>&gt; abilities which can carry an intelligence, a human</i><br>
<i>&gt; personality which we can *recognize as us* into an</i><br>
<p>
At least in the beginning. From then on, this version has to <br>
rapidly evolve in a sequence of pseudocontinuum microsteps (and occasional <br>
backtracks, issued by clone history consensus) into something Different. <br>
<p>
Orelse join the populous extinction party, before long. Thanks, not me. <br>
Trying to survive is one of those old-fashioned traits I'd like to keep. <br>
Call me squeamish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; environment. If we do want to retain some human</i><br>
<p>
Will the brave new rules tolerate obsolescent strategies, on the <br>
really long run, I wonder? What one wants, and what one finally gets are <br>
usually not identical. Should digital reality be different?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; elements, it may be neccessary to emulate some </i><br>
<i>&gt; hormonal action- remember this thread started with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rich, who seems to think men are pretty much</i><br>
<i>&gt; hormone driven creatures; - )</i><br>
<p>
I think actual implementation will rapidly drift away from raw physics, <br>
into something more abstract, something with a yet better map to the <br>
underlying hardware. (Always assuming canonical Dyson computer cluster. <br>
Things beyond we cannot quite parse (yet)).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How much bandwidth to simulate the impulses of the hypothalamus? In our</i><br>
<i>&gt; current  "WETWARE", it takes up</i><br>
<i>&gt; only about one three hundredth of the brain.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, so you want to make sex something casual, something which does not <br>
tie up your resources for the AR equivalent of a few 10 ms? Then yes, <br>
this is my idea of upload sex. But then this pesky partner selection...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;_and_ we admit Darwinian evolution in </i><br>
<i>&gt; (it will be impossible to keep him out, I'm afraid -- notice that this </i><br>
<i>&gt; automagically introduces some form of death, or do we speak Lamarckian </i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution here, where mutation leaves the organism altered, but alive-o?), </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm afraid Lamarckian evolution finally  may</i><br>
<i>&gt; have it's day in any conscious software that can</i><br>
<i>&gt; reprogram itself at will.</i><br>
<p>
It won't be Lamarck alone, most likely it will be an amalgam of Darwin <br>
and Lamarck. (Pure Darwin only for the bacteria equivalents, which are <br>
too dumb for autoengineering).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;we'll wind up having scarce resources, more sooner than later. Some of them</i><br>
<i>&gt; being time (attention devoted, etc), computation, whatever. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not enough bandwidth for VR? I notice there is no talk</i><br>
<p>
AR, not VR. VR is something you can buy even now. Requiring an artifical <br>
reality closely modeled after the pre-upload physical world is a weakness, <br>
imo.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; here of what TYPE of upload, dry, semi-soft, wet...</i><br>
<p>
I think only one optimal solution for a given conformation of atoms and <br>
energy flux exists (assuming non-transcendence scenario here, which does <br>
not look too likely assuming the Silence in the Skies). This solution <br>
will precipitate pretty soon, even leaving no corpses of the other TYPEs in <br>
its trail ("Assimilation, the new industry standard" -- Borg Gates).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In neural activity, things move rather quickly, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; upload time will be at least as fast, a healthy sexual encounter may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered leasurely and lengthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it takes a second....</i><br>
<p>
(wonder, how long an unhealthy one might take... nah ;)<br>
<p>
Yes, but relatively to the rest of the AR, one second lasts centuries. <br>
Sign off now, and login to something utterly incomprehensible just a few <br>
fleeting aeons later.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Burning computational resources for body dynamics, fakespace renderers, </i><br>
<i>&gt; etc. might become too costly, once entire system matter has been </i><br>
<i>&gt; converted into a Dyson shell computer </i><br>
<i>&gt; (very soon, &lt;&lt;1 kYr), and this </i><br>
<i>&gt; mind substrate dish populated sufficiently densely (much faster, &lt;&lt;1 Yr).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You know this to be the only future? How so?</i><br>
<p>
No. This is what I can talk about. Future will be different. Sufficiently <br>
different, to be incomprehensible. But I can't talk about things <br>
incomprehensible. So I either have to shut my trap, or talk about kiddy <br>
stuff. I prefer kiddy stuff.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even Moravec doesn't put too much faith in this.. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think he called Dyson's ideas "new and half baked..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; these are lovely ideas, but hardly concrete.</i><br>
<i>&gt; but even if it is so certain in your mind...</i><br>
<p>
Nothing is certain. Moravec's no prophet, btw. He might see farther than <br>
most, but he doesn't see it all. (He'd be god, if he did).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; ... why this attachment to replication and body? dont you enjoy a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; mindfuck?</i><br>
<p>
Ack, the dreaded word. The one I have so meticulously tried to avoid... <br>
 <br>
Too late. %&amp;<br>
