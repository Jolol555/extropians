Hi everyone<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On Sat 05 Oct 1996 I mumbled:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;I have to say I regret the tone of rancor that seems to</i><br>
have                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;crept into these public postings of late.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
and John K. Clark responded:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I regret the rancor too. I can strongly disagree with somebody and still be </i><br>
<i>&gt;quite found of them, but I'm only human (damn it). When somebody asks me to </i><br>
<i>&gt;tell them exactly what is it about Nanotechnology manufacturing that makes it </i><br>
<i>&gt;much easier to do than conventional manufacturing, and I take the time to </i><br>
<i>&gt;respond with 6 fundamental reasons, and it is dismissed with 4 words, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;I get mad</i><br>
<p>
Quite so.  I suggest we go back a couple of steps and see if this impasse<br>
can be broken.<br>

<p>
But is this true?  If true, is it (comparatively) easy?  Good ole Drexler et<br>
al [hi, Al!] make the following interesting and, I think, key point:<br>
<p>
`If a car were assembled from normal-sized robots from a thousand pieces,<br>
each piece having been assembled by smaller robots from a thousand smaller<br>
pieces [...] then only ten levels of assembly process would separate cars<br>
from molecules.' (UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE, 1991, p. 66)<br>
<p>
In broad terms:<br>
<p>
`Molecular assemblers build blocks that go to block assemblers [which] build<br>
computers, which go to system assemblers, which build systems, which-- at<br>
least one path from molecules to large products seems clear enough.'  (ibid)<br>
<p>
This is the Leggo model of nanomanufacture.  It implies that sarin gas,<br>
automobiles and raw (or cooked) steaks can be compiled in a ten-deep<br>
hierarchy of gluing one atom (or molecule, or large chunk) onto another by<br>
following a template.  <br>
<p>
Compare this with living replicators (the single existence proof available).<br>
Genetic algorithms in planetary numbers lurch about for billions of years,<br>
replicating and mutating and being winnowed via their expressed phenotypic<br>
success, and at last accumulate/represent a humungous quantity of<br>
compressed, schematic information.  They do *not*, one must remark, entirely<br>
*embody* it.  That sketchy information gets unpacked via (1) a rich<br>
information-dense environment (so that a string of amino acids folds up<br>
spontaneously into a protein whose effectivity depends precisely on the new<br>
`emergent' folded surface) and (2) a sequence of `darwinian' selection<br>
processes at higher and higher hierarchical (`holonic') levels.  <br>
<p>
Remember, a one-cell human embryo uses on the order of a mere 100,000 genes<br>
to kick-start a critter which ends up with trillions of dedicated cells.  It<br>
does so by using compression tricks: modularity (those trillions comprise<br>
variants of just 256 distinct types of human cell), segmentation,<br>
chemo-gradients, etc.  While it's possible that Kauffman spontaneous<br>
ordering principles also restrict and potentiate the permissible outcomes,<br>
we don't yet have a clue (as far as I know) what the nano equivalents of<br>
those rules would be.<br>
<p>
J-P Changeux, Gerald Edelman and William Calvin, e.g., provide plausible<br>
accounts of how the brain wires itself in such a stochastic fashion,<br>
*without needing precise wiring diagrams* in the DNA recipe.  Even so, it<br>
takes 20 years to build and program a natural human-level intelligence, even<br>
though all the elements are being assembled by nanofabricators as fast as<br>
they can manage it.  (And don't forget, all the cultural information that<br>
has modulated our innate grammar templates is stored in extended semiotic<br>
systems of immense complexity far surpassing anything the Human Genome<br>
Project is going to hold in its completed files.)<br>
<p>
Now we are told that contrived nanosystems will bypass all this<br>
thud-and-blunder darwinian nonsense and cut straight to the chase.  Instead<br>
of mastering the huge number of coding steps used to specify and debug a<br>
complex object, we might simply (`simply') scan the object at the atomic<br>
level, file the 3D co-ordinates of each atom or molecule, and then have that<br>
instruction set run through a zillion teeny nano assemblers, which will<br>
allocate and time-share the job of first making smallest components, then<br>
joining them into next-biggest chunks, and up the 10 steps to a gleaming,<br>
atomically-precise Consumer Thing!<br>
<p>
How many atoms was that again?  <br>
<p>
How much memory do you have in your hard drive?  (Is that a stupid and<br>
out-dated question, given that the process is massively paralleled, its data<br>
stored in a zillion independent - but inter-communicating - nano jobbies?<br>
Oh, your scanners are using compression tricks too?  See below...)<br>
<p>
John, I think this little excursion shows how much is begged by positing<br>
bravely: `if you have a good description of an object'.  <br>
<p>
A more detailed examination of this issue would need to look at, e.g., Jack<br>
Cohen and Ian Stewart's treatment of emergent attractors in dynamical<br>
systems, real-world hierarchies regarded as Tangled Strange Loops (borrowing<br>
from Douglas Hofstadter) rather than being arranged neatly as simple<br>
step-after-step stairways.  They observe: `Reductionism holds that the<br>
high-level structure is a logical consequence of the low-level rules, and we<br>
have no wish to dispute this...  [But for *understanding* we] have to be<br>
able to follow the chain of deduction.  If that chain becomes too long, our<br>
brains lose track of the explanation, and then it ceases to be one.  But<br>
this is how emergent phenomena emerge'  (THE COLLAPSE OF CHAOS, Penguin,<br>
1995, p. 438).  True, they are making an epistemological and not an<br>
engineering point, but it has practical implications for anyone hoping to<br>
emulate hypercomplex systems from the molecule up, via explicit nano<br>
procedures.  <br>
<p>
I'm inclined to think we'll get interesting results faster through massively<br>
parallel darwinian simulations in digital configuration space (CAs and GAs),<br>
or through superposed Deutsch quantum computations, or even via<br>
artfully-coded DNA computations in a meaty broth (a process that's already<br>
been used to bust fancy encryption schemes).  The link from impossibly<br>
complex algorithms generated by such means, and nano fabrication, will very<br>
quickly escape our understanding, and as a result we will be obliged to<br>
depend for reliable results (and our safety!) upon iterated trial &amp; error<br>
within impeccable confinement protocols, perhaps overseen by enhanced AI or<br>
AI-augmented human watchdogs.  None of this suggests Civilisation Made<br>
Simple By Scan-And-Follow-The-Dots Nano.<br>
<p>
John went on:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Exactly what is it about Nanotechnology  that is so different from</i><br>
conventional manufacturing...? <br>
<p>
[and offered six answers:]<br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt;1) The parts a car factory uses are very expensive, the parts that </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Nanotechnology  uses are very cheap.</i><br>
<p>
Assuming you can use them without a sublimely complex scanning &amp; assembly<br>
protocol, or can afford to wait for the atom-by-atom scan and have the<br>
memory to write it to.  <br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;2) A car factory uses many thousands or millions of different types of</i><br>
<i> &gt;parts and you must learn how to operate all of them. At the most, </i><br>
<i>&gt;Nanotechnology uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real</i><br>
<i> &gt;world almost everything we know is made of less than 20, less than 10</i><br>
<i> &gt;parts for life.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I find this confused.  By the time we're at level 3 or 4, we are back<br>
to lots of different specialised sub-units, on Drexler's own account.  Am I<br>
missing something here?<br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt;3) All the many different parts the factory uses are fragile [but] There is </i><br>
<i>&gt;no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.</i><br>
<p>
A scanned and reassembled steak is a steak.  On the other hand, to take<br>
optimum advantage of nano fabrication requires that we *won't* be using a<br>
scanning protocol, since a faithfully atom-by-atom scanned car will have all<br>
the drawbacks of its original.  And if you mean to build a new, improved car<br>
from the atom up, *you will need the kinds of intelligent, costly<br>
programming that Lyle insists upon.*  I don't see how this can be avoided,<br>
except by waving the Magic SuperIntelligent Handy Obedient AI Genie wand.<br>
This might come true, as we go into the Singularity, but like some other<br>
(partial) skeptics I wonder if it's not akin to the wistful dream a bunny<br>
rabbit has of the way &gt;Rabbits will provide all their food and comforts for<br>
them.  That's true, they do, until the &gt;Rabbits turn up one day with a<br>
cylinder of unfriendly calcivirus.<br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt;4) None of the parts the factory uses are absolutely identical. [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.</i><br>
<p>
By the time we've chunked up the 10 steps, `identical' parts might have<br>
diverged again, especially if they're put together by anything resembling<br>
chemo-gradient-guided self-assembly.  (This is just an intuition on my part;<br>
I hope I'm wrong.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   domain, and I think most of us know the advantage of that.</i><br>
<p>
Again, if you can specify adequately at the digital level, well and good.<br>
How many bytes was that, did you say?  (But this is certainly a point in<br>
favor of building from the lowest level up, if we can.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;6) Most of the parts a factory uses are very complex [...]  Nanotechnology</i><br>
<i> &gt;is like building with leggo blocks, you can build structures of arbitrary </i><br>
<i>&gt;complexity [...]  It's easy to develop an algorithm to examine any leggo</i><br>
<i> &gt;object and then build a duplicate, it's very far from easy to find an</i><br>
<i> &gt;algorithm that would do the same with a car.   </i><br>
<p>
Of course you can copy a molecular *Leggo* but it's the monster algorithm<br>
for connecting them into a car that's exactly what is at stake.<br>
<p>
I apologise for the vast length of this post, but I think the topic requires<br>
exceptional care (and even this much blather is just blundering on the<br>
outskirts).<br>
<p>
Please, folks, tell me why I'm wrong...<br>
<p>
Best to all, Damien<br>
