Extropians may want to check out the November 18, 1996 edition of Forbes<br>
magazine.  The cover story is entitled "Cyber Power", by Peter Huber.  Here's<br>
the description of the article from the magazine's web site:<br>
<p>
  Modern, electronically connected markets<br>
  are more powerful than any politician.<br>
<p>
The article expresses some of the ideas that have been very influential in<br>
this forum for a long time regarding the erosion of territorially-based<br>
nation-states in the face of electronic commerce.  Yet another sign of our<br>
ideas making it into the mainstream.<br>
<p>
Also, in a separate Forbes publication, "Forbes ASAP":<br>
<p>
  Now on newstands, the Forbes ASAP "Big<br>
  Issue". 53 of the world's most interesting minds<br>
  writing on the future of technology, business and<br>
  society. <br>
<p>
I'm still working my way through it, but this is a good cross-section of<br>
mainstream thinking on many of the issues with which we are concerned.<br>

"The iconoclast proves enough when he proves by his blasphemy that this<br>
or that idol is defectively convincing - that at least *one* visitor<br>
to the shrine is left full of doubts. The liberation of the human mind has<br>
been best furthered by gay fellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries<br>
and then went roistering down the highways of the world, proving to all<br>
men that doubt, after all, was safe - that the god in the sanctuary was a<br>
fraud. One horse-laugh is worth ten-thousand syllogisms."<br>
-- H.L. Mencken<br>
