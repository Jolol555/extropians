&lt;Davin Said&lt;  Even Jesus said the poor, they<br>
&lt;&gt; will always be with us.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;Suresh said&gt;&gt;Oh, great, and The Words of God(tm), are a good basis for<br>
dealing with  society. Why should we accept poverty? If we are talkking about<br>
such <br>
 grandiose things as uploading, Dyson Spheres and immortality, why can't <br>
 we discuss utopias for all. It shouldn't be beyond humanity's grasp.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
My point was not "god (who I don't believe exists) said".  I said "Jesus<br>
said".  My point was: give the man (yes, just a man) some credit.   He was a<br>
keen observer of poverty.  He lived it.  Yet, he still made this observation.<br>
<p>
<p>
Even the very socialistic Jesus saw that there will always be some people who<br>
will choose to be poor, no matter what you do for them or give them.  And, I<br>
add, some people are lazy.   The poor they will always be with us, so lets do<br>
what we can and get on with our own lives.  Don't drag the society down to<br>
the level of the poorest of poor.   Compassion yes, charity yes,  but I have<br>
a life to live also.<br>
<p>
Socialism helps people remain lazy by giving them something for no work, e.g.<br>
nothing in return.   Give them a Freeman Dyson Sphere,  a Dan Anderson Double<br>
Dyson Sphere, or a Larry Niven Ringworld and there will still be homeless,<br>
lazy, poor, and fun-loving people who don't like to keep track of or make<br>
money, etc.  These people exist because they people choose that life.  <br>
<p>
I know people who gave up their professions because they hated it, to become<br>
Renaissance Faire actors.  Now that may be poor, but they at lease love there<br>
job now.   <br>
