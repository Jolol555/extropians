Ahh! Very good. I glad to see that we're now into talking about action and<br>
doing something to actually cause our desires to happen, instead of all<br>
this mental masturbation and copulation.<br>
<p>
So maybe this is the time to again bring up the subject of making sure that<br>
we are all still around to see those dreams come true. Most of you profess<br>
to embrace the ideas of cryonics. But surely you know that cryonics is very<br>
problematic at this time for many reasons. The damage that is being done<br>
during even the best cryopreservations may be completely obliterating<br>
memory and other precious mental attributes. We have no proof that it is<br>
not. And the movement is so small that it may not have the power to get you<br>
safely through to future restoration. What we need is a proven method of<br>
supended animation which is clearly demonstrated to work and by doing so<br>
will increase the size and power of the cryonics and potential immortality<br>
movement. The science of cryobiology has now advanced to the stage where<br>
this goal is realistically feasible with relatively small funding.<br>
<p>
That is the goal of the Prometheus Project of which I am the founder and<br>
chief promoter. Several members of this list have already made pledges to<br>
fund this Project to conduct the R&amp;D necessary to achieve fully reverisible<br>
whole-body human suspended animation within 20 years. You can find out who<br>
they are by looking at:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.prometheus-project.org/prometheus/pledgers.html">http://www.prometheus-project.org/prometheus/pledgers.html</a><br>
<p>
No money is being requested now; all pledges are conditional upon the full<br>
amount of $1 million per year being pledged and upon approval of the<br>
science and business plans. The pledges are for the purchase of shares in a<br>
for-profit corporation which will be formed to execute the Project. If you<br>
cannot afford to pledge the minimum of $1000 per year, you could find<br>
someone else and do so jointly. In addition, I need help from people with<br>
good ideas, and the energy to implement them, in promoting this project.<br>
