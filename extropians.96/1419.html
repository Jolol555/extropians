<i>&gt; Thank you for sharing your experience.  What a convenient and</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-congratulatory interpretation.  I see that with a worldview of relative</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth and mythological history, that truth must be decided by a popularity</i><br>
<i>&gt; contest.  Just pick the right mailing list with like-minded individuals, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost anything could be true.  In my experience with the list, oftentimes posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't generate responses because nonsensical things are claimed in the post, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; many individuals know the proverb about not arguing with fools, because others</i><br>
<i>&gt; may not be able to tell the difference.  Hmm...</i><br>
<p>
	Truth is relative and it is decided by a popularity contests.<br>
	If people didn't embrace the idea that the Earth revolved around<br>
	the Sun, then it would not become true.  Truth can also be forced<br>
	upon an individual: "you must believe that this is true otherwise<br>
	we are going to lock you away in a padded room."<br>
<p>
	Is truth a result of an experiment?  Which a year or so from now<br>
	becomes false because 'we' discovered something else which seems<br>
	more true.<br>
<p>
	Actual truth is unknown and will ALWAYS be unknown.  Without relitive<br>
	truth 'we' have nothing.<br>
<p>
	Are you claiming to know actual truth?  Hmm...<br>
