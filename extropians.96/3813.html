I was considering all the developments on the web when I heard about a<br>
startup called Name.Space which will decentralize the power InterNIC<br>
currently holds in defining domain names and allow everyone to have their<br>
original name for $25/month. You would no longer be limited into a certain<br>
format such as edu, org, gov, com, or net. It would allow you to create any<br>
name such as "Extropy.Institute" which could be the Extropy Institute's<br>
webpage address instead of "www.extropy.org" as it is currently and isn't<br>
as easy to remember. InterNIC is REALLY battling this guy because he is<br>
trying to overthrow the gov't centralized InterNIC who have a monopoly on<br>
domain names and run a background check on you before you can acquire a<br>
specific address. Using the new method proposed by NameSpace it would allow<br>
for the free market to dip into the domain naming sector as well as allow<br>
more options. You can checkout this startup company at<br>
"<a href="http://namespace.autono.net/">http://namespace.autono.net/</a>" you can also download software there that<br>
changes your DNS (Domain name server) to theirs to augment the range of<br>
webpages you can now access. It doesn't hinder your normal web access at<br>
all but allows you to also read the new domain name format. This is a<br>
perfect example on how to decentralize the net even further and remove any<br>
residues leftover from when it was the military-founded ARPAnet. This help<br>
will remove the gov't's grip on the net and allow for it to run out of<br>
control out of their hands. The software is EASY to install and is only 1k<br>
which is why I MIME attached the Win95 upgrade version to this message.<br>
There is an upgrade for all machine types and name.space highly encourages<br>
for ISPs to switchover to this new format. To promote extropy we should try<br>
to email as many people as possible to have them support it, demand our<br>
ISPs support this new format and upgrade as many people as possible. We<br>
must prevent a limited name structure from limiting and breaking the net!<br>
Name.Space doesn't believe in censorship and strongly believes in free<br>
markets and spontaneous orders. The guy even used the word "meme". Sounds<br>
like a closet extropian to me! Another thing you can do to increase Extropy<br>
is to install Juno free email on as many PCs as possible and thus give<br>
everyone email so that people can communicate with more people and<br>
breakdown geographical barriors among the masses.<br>
