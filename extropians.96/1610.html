<p>
You can retrieve the list's info file at any time by sending<br>
"info extropians" to extropians-request@extropy.org...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; info extropians</i><br>

<p>
Where did you hear about us?<br>
<p>
In response to your request, your address has been added to the<br>
Extropians mailing list. Welcome! We expect you will find the<br>
information you receive through the List highly intellectually <br>
stimulating, and inspiring.<br>
<p>
This message informs you of the few list rules subscribers abide by, and<br>
tells you where to find out more about what Extropians talk about<br>
and practice.<br>
<p>
What characteristics do readers of the Extropians List have in common?<br>
Despite a strong diversity of characters and interests, all share an<br>
interest in overcoming human limits through science, technology,<br>
and reason. List subscribers have an interest in some or all of the<br>
following: <br>
--Life extension beyond the current genetic limit, including<br>
   experimental approaches such as cryonic suspension; <br>
--the augmentation of human intelligence; <br>
--individualist, voluntary approaches to social and political institutions <br>
   (many subscribers call themselves libertarians);<br>
--the technological extension of human perception and cognition; <br>
--artificial intelligence and artificial life; <br>
--advanced computer technology;<br>
--rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)<br>
--nanotechnology, and other advanced and future technologies;<br>
--the philosophical and psychological aspects and issues of<br>
   perpetually improving our lives; and space colonization.<br>
--the use of art to represent extropic ideas and values<br>
--the economics of accelerating change and of the future<br>
<p>
The unifying characteristic of these ideas and values is the drive<br>
to increase extropy. Extropy is a measure of intelligence, information,<br>
vitality, opportunity, and capacity for growth. Not all list subscribers<br>
wish to apply a label to themselves, but many who share these values<br>
and ideas call themselves Extropians. If these ideas appeal to you,<br>
you may already be an Extropian.<br>
<p>
We have a number of rules about how you interact with the list. Your <br>
continued subscription indicates your acceptance of these rules. <br>
We do not like rules for their own sake. The List rules are just those<br>
we believe will keep the level of discussion high and polite. Subscribers'<br>
time is valuable. To keep as many people active and  reading the list as<br>
possible, we need to respect them by keeping the signal to noise<br>
ratio as high as possible.<br>
<p>
I suggest you read the postings for a while before you begin to post.<br>
In that way you will have a better idea of how the list works. Also,<br>
topics vary from week to week, and month to month; sometimes we are<br>
very technical other times very political or philosophical.<br>
<p>
ESPECIALLY FOR USERS OF THE LIST WHEN IT DISALLOWED FORWARDING OF POSTS: <br>
If you post to the Extropians List, you must anticipate that your<br>
writing might be forwarded to another list or to particular individuals.<br>
Postings will appear in a publicly-accessible archive at the following<br>
URL: <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians</a><br>
<p>
 1) Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to:<br>
<p>
	postmaster@extropy.org<br>
<p>
 2a) Mail to the list should be sent to:<br>
<p>
	extropians@extropy.org<br>
<p>
 2b) The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers<br>
 so that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address<br>
 replies BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: extropians@extropy.org]<br>
<p>
 2c) If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually address<br>
 a reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the message<br>
 in a text editor should help you determine the sender's address.<br>
<p>
 2d) It is strongly recommend but not required that all list members use a<br>
 signature file containing their e-mail address.<br>
<p>
 3) Due to the volume of list traffic please restrain yourself from over-<br>
 quoting  previous posts -- just a couple of lines to re-cap for those  who <br>
 weren't paying attention is usually sufficient.<br>
<p>
 4) The list is conceived as a forum for the exchange of new information<br>
 and techniques, and not as a forum for debating the  basics. We do have<br>
 our disagreements -- often quite lively ones -- but rarely about really<br>
 basic issues. Arguments in favor of socialized medicine or dying a <br>
 natural death at age sixty are, judging by past experience, likely to be<br>
 refuted, and finally ignored.<br>
<p>
 5) Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high. We like to keep the <br>
 signal- to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the impulse<br>
 to post "me-too" messages or ad hominem flames to the list at large.<br>
 If you cannot resist engaging in such discourse, please do so<br>
 in private e-mail.<br>
<p>
 5b) Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix "META:"<br>
  We encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post.<br>
 Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.<br>
<p>
 5c) Polls being submitted to list members will have the "POLL:"<br>
 prefix.<br>
<p>
 5d) Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting <br>
 are not allowed!<br>
<p>
 5e) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do?; we have a<br>
 private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a<br>
 judge (the List Administrator) and an adjudicator to handle appeals.<br>
<p>
 If someone really annoys you, you can do any of the following:<br>
 1) Nothing - give no response<br>
 2) Respond OFF the list<br>
 5) Make a formal complaint to me asking for a judgment against Person X<br>
<p>
 5f) What if you just have to respond to "up hold your honor" or to set <br>
 the "facts/record straight," or to tell the entire list why you<br>
 will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who<br>
 offended you?<br>
<p>
 D O N ' T!<br>
<p>
 we consider such responses flames in their own right and you would<br>
 be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be censured or<br>
 removed from the list.<br>
<p>
Remember:<br>
 Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.<br>
 doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes <br>
 meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.<br>
<p>

As List member Hal Finney wrote:<br>
<p>
"Extropianism is a philosophy of life. Max More, editor of Extropy,<br>
has identified five Extropian principles:<br>
<p>
	- Boundless Expansion<br>
	- Self Transformation<br>
	- Dynamic Optimism<br>
	- Intelligent Technology<br>
	- Spontaneous Order<br>
<p>
"You can see that the basic point is a belief that the<br>
future will allow virtually unlimited expansion in the possibilities<br>
for our own personal lives. Extropians reject limits imposed by<br>
outsiders on what we can do and what we can become. We embrace the<br>
future, with all of its awe-inspiring possibilities.<br>
<p>
"The role of [these] books is to show that these aren't just idle<br>
musings and hopes, but are well-grounded expectations about what we<br>
are going to have to work with in the next century. Without having<br>
read those books, such common-place Extropian ideas as immortality or<br>
a world without governments might seem absurd.<br>
<p>
"If you haven't read these books but want to ask questions about these<br>
and other Extropian ideas, the problem is that the answer is usually<br>
going to be, first read the book. You can't answer a question about<br>
the possibility for immortality in a page or two, not in any kind of<br>
convincing way.<br>
<p>
"Now, after you've read some of these books, you still may not agree<br>
that all of these ideas are practical, but at least you can discuss<br>
them on common ground with other list members. That kind of<br>
discussion is practical, helpful, and informative. Extropians are not<br>
dogmatists. If there are practical problems standing in the way of<br>
the realization of their hopes and ideals, we should be discussing<br>
them now, so that solutions can be found.<br>
<p>
"Of course, some people will be opposed to Extropian ideas not because<br>
they seem impractical, but because they seem immoral. Re-read the list<br>
of Extropian principles above. If you don't agree with them, if you<br>
don't agree that we should attempt to break through all the limits<br>
that constrain us today, then you probably won't benefit from<br>
discussion with Extropians.<br>
<p>
"The Extropian list is not meant to proselytize, to gain converts.<br>
Most people either find the ideas instinctively attractive, or they<br>
find them abhorrent. It's a waste of everyone's time to come on the<br>
list and to argue that governments are really good for us and that<br>
death is desirable. Those are the kinds of messages that lead to<br>
serious flaming, and no one benefits from them.<br>
<p>
"To sum up, the Extropians lists welcome members who share an interest<br>
in the exciting, optimistic, future-oriented philosophy of<br>
Extropianism. If you're new to these ideas, they can offer<br>
suggestions to help you find books, authors, and other resources to<br>
learn more about what we can and will become. If you're more<br>
experienced, they offer discussion and feedback with a high level of<br>
quality and responsiveness. The future is coming, and the Extropian<br>
lists offer you a chance to get ready for the fantastic opportunities<br>
that await us all."<br>
