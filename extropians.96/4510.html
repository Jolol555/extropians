OK. Here's a response.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) Computers wil obtain intelligence/autonomity &lt;snip&gt; What matters is that they will able to support and develop themself without human assistance.</i><br>
<p>
First of all, just adding more of complexity or data or whatever isn't<br>
likely to do the job, otherwise AI would have made much more progress<br>
that it has. Second, why presume that once we can have conversations<br>
with AIs, that they will become antisocial and remote from us?? It is<br>
the relationships which promote the information exchange which permits<br>
individual and societal evolution and intelligence increase.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) It is to expensive to send a lot of humans to space &lt;snip&gt; planting a seed of autonomous robots somewher with enough energy and raw materials for them to replicate.</i><br>
<p>
Well there's the non replicant Mars Exlorer just recently lauched. Why<br>
not go a step further and allow uploading to the replicants, then those<br>
of us who want to can particpate in all of this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) The robots with their endless patience and practically infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifespans will then start exploring space in a logarithmic way. </i><br>
<p>
Surely you mean exponential.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(You know</i><br>
<i>&gt; breeding new offspring as they arive to new energy sources and mining</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas.)Robo Sapiens.</i><br>
<p>
Read Olaf Stapleton's works about this topic, written 50 years ago.<br>
Again, let's upload and be part of this adventure??<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does the scenario hold and what is the reason then for us as biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings to go to space and live eternal lives? </i><br>
We need a reason?? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hope this isn't a discussion done with a long ago.</i><br>
IMHO, ALL topics are discussed to death on the Net. Don't worry about<br>
it.<br>
