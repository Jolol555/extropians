<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
By "high level" I mean replacing macro-scale brain structures with hardware<br>
based on a foreign computational architectures.<br>
<p>
Actually, the difficulty isn't so much in the hardware as it is in the<br>
interfacing software.  On a micro scale this is fairly easy since you are<br>
only looking at discrete signals.  On a macro scale, however, you also have<br>
to consider the relationships between signals on the order of millions or<br>
billions of simultaneous signals.  This has to be done both going in to the<br>
hardware and going back in to the brain.  The computational complexity of<br>
decoding this type of interface would require immense quantities of<br>
computational power.  <br>
<p>
You could use neural network based enhancement hardware to minimize the<br>
interfacing problem, but neural networks are not efficient computational<br>
architectures for many classes of problems.  In the long run, it would break<br>
down to how much you are willing to spend for computational enhancement.<br>
The cost/performance ratio could get prohibitively large very fast, based<br>
almost exclusively on the complexity of installation and integration.<br>
