It can be much more subtle than that. The important question is "What kind<br>
of existence?". I think it would be unlikely that we create successors<br>
that out-compete us, most likely they will inhabit a somewhat different<br>
ecological/memetic niche that will overlap with ours; competition and <br>
cooperation will most likely lead to adaption.<br>
<p>
For example, humans thrive on the Earth, which from the perspective of a<br>
dry nano superbeing is the Sixth Circle of Hell - air which oxidizes and <br>
prevents easy landing, a complex environment and a deep gravity well. <br>
Materials can be gathered much more easy in the Belt. And we can't survive <br>
well in space. So the nanobeings might evolve out there, while trading <br>
nanoproducts for interesting biological experiences from Earth. A bit <br>
like the zones in AFUtD. <br>
<p>
Another possibility would be symbiosis: humans might become parts of<br>
extended organisms involving biological, artificial and natural elements,<br>
providing things like optimism, human values, irrational behavior, pattern<br>
recognition and the ability to scratch well - we might be very surprised<br>
of what posthuman beings may need. And in the long run these extended<br>
organisms evolve, until we become parts of them just as procaryotes became<br>
cruicial organelles in eucaryote cells (to borrow from the Filter thread). <br>
