From: Damien Broderick &lt;damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; I still find this kind of retort utterly baffling, even though it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; undeniable that one goes happily into sleep (or perhaps less happily into</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical unconsciousness) expecting that the `reconstituted' self that later</i><br>
<i>&gt; wakes is continuous with the present person.  And of course the only reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; for having one's head frozen at death is the conviction that a revived or</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploaded brain will be just as much `me' as `I' am after a snooze.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe we should think harder about whether our identity is preserved<br>
across sleep.  This break in the stream of consciousness looks pretty<br>
complete to me.  Many young children go through a phase where they are<br>
afraid to fall asleep.  Perhaps some fear the loss of consciousness and<br>
are not confident about still being alive when someone with their<br>
memories awakens the next morning.<br>
<p>
Imagine a race which didn't sleep, and which viewed any interruption in<br>
the stream of consciousness with the same horror that the upload<br>
skeptics here feel about destructive uploading.  How could you convince<br>
them that your identity was in fact preserved across sleep, that the<br>
entire human race isn't committing (involuntary) suicide every night,<br>
with new people starting each morning under the mere illusion that they<br>
had survived the night?<br>
<p>
Try to imagine that you, yourself, do die every night, and awaken each<br>
morning as a new person, with only memories to link you to the person you<br>
were before?  Is this possible?  How will it be different when someone with<br>
your memories awakens as an upload?<br>
<p>
