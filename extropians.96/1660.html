        Uh oh.  Rational pessemism vs. rational optimism.  First of all, out<br>
of curiosity, why are you searching for 'the meaning of life'?  I'm sure<br>
that some people could find the pursuit itself to be hedonistic.  What is<br>
the reasoning behind the pursuit?  Anyway, enough of that.<br>
<p>
        I have two slightly contrasting views on what 'the meaning of life'<br>
is.  On one hand, the meaning of life could be different for each person.<br>
Who's to say that 'the meaning of life' is the same for everyone?  My other<br>
theory is the one I agree with completely: the meaning of life is life.  See<br>
how simple that is?  So simple that I think most people don't even consider<br>
it.  The fact that I am living is so much more powerful than not living.  I<br>
love life.  I would hate to die.  I am alive, and I am writing this; if I<br>
was dead, I would not be writing this.  I am alive, and I can see a<br>
multitude of color; if I was dead, I would see no color.  I am alive, and I<br>
can look deeply into the eyes of someone I love; I could not do that if I<br>
was dead.  The exquisite beauty of everything I see around me, from the most<br>
beautiful starscape to the most base gum wrapper, is so much more than not<br>
being able to see that.  This is not hedonism --a hedonist does everything<br>
solely for pleasure-- this is life.  Finding pleasure *within* life.<br>
<p>
        As for your view of assuming that the universe is dying, I can't say<br>
much.  I merely disagree.  I'd rather assume that the universe has no end<br>
until it's before my very eyes.  I can't *prove* that the universe is<br>
omnipotent, but in the same effect, no-one has yet been able to *prove* that<br>
it's not.  If you find proof, please let me know!  :-)<br>
