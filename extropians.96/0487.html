It's very difficult to use the word 'stupid' in such a way as to make it<br>
clear that you do not intend it to be degrading and emotive; which means it<br>
would be difficult to change its connotations by usage alone.<br>
<p>
Compare this to the reclaiming of 'queer' by the gay community: they have<br>
been able to do this by using the word to describe _themselves_.<br>
<p>
I can see how 'stupid' might become emotionally-neutral if people who<br>
considered themselves stupid called _themselves_ stupid, but not if others<br>
call them stupid. Even if those others were careful to qualify their<br>
statements, I believe it would smack of sentences which begin "I'm not<br>
homophobic but...", etc. and still not achieve anything.<br>
