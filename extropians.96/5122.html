For a good time, try calculating the average number of players in a run of<br>
the shooting room game.  This calculation throws an interesting light on<br>
questions like how to play "given you're in the shooting room game,"<br>
what a "typical game" would be like, and what fraction of the players are<br>
in the last round (i.e., what are we taking a fraction *of*?)<br>
<p>
It will also help calculate the number of times each person should slap<br>
their forehead and say "Doh!"<br>
<p>
See if you can modify the game so that the majority of players are still<br>
in the last round, there is an "average number of players", and the<br>
number of players still increases by an integer factor in each round.<br>
I wasn't able to do it.<br>
<p>
Is there still a paradox if you limit the pool of available<br>
players, or (equivalently) the maximum number of rounds?<br>
