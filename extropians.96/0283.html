Don't fall for one of the oldest IT myths: what is processor power? Is it <br>
the clock or the producer MIPS rating? Hardly so. Is it what a test suite <br>
measures? Better, but then there are lots of ratings, depending on what <br>
is being measured. If you measure local Flops the result will be <br>
drastically different from measuring local or nonlocal memory bandwidth.<br>
<p>
Memory bandwith latency progress is asymptotic. Even worse, the price <br>
fluctuates wildly due to market politics. Even the physical clocks will <br>
run into a saturation zone very soon. Afaik Alpha will soon run at 0.5 GHz. <br>
End of line for current Si/Ge semiconductors lies about 2 GHz. And this <br>
is local clock, friends and neighbours. Off-chip accesses are waaaay off. <br>
Trying to run a macroscopic bus at &gt;100 MHz is asking for trouble.<br>
<p>
About the only thing which goes up exponential is integration density. <br>
But what shall we do if it runs well into nm domain? Wires don't conduct <br>
at quantum scale too well.<br>
<p>
Sorry, system power has rencently started to show signs of saturation. <br>
We'll need to go maspar, soon. The advent of SMP (which is an extremely <br>
poor parallelism) in high-end PCs is a portent for the future.<br>

Yeah. This is merely going slightly beyond Biomuse. <br>

I think it will need heavy training, preferably in a very young age to <br>
make sense of all the extra data. Though to some it may appear horrible, <br>
I think babies should be equipped with implants soon after birth. Only <br>
they can become the true power users.<br>

<i>&gt; There are some speculation that the attractors replicate as a part of </i><br>
<i>&gt; mental functioning. In this case adding more "cortex" would give us a </i><br>

<p>
Yes, but I wish this has happend at the genome level. (Toying with the <br>
size of the cortex is easy: the genome is quite modular). On the other <br>
hand, I remember reading that brain metabolism is even now a bottleneck <br>
at some (early) developmental stage...<br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; I think most of the brain is rather static in circuitry, but its meaning </i><br>
<i>&gt; can be very quickly redefined (remember the experiments with glasses </i><br>
<i>&gt; turning everything upside down - after a while vision worked as normal). </i><br>
<i>&gt; My guess is that parts of the cortex are undefined from the beginning, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and later used in various systems that emerge. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but even then their malleability is limited. Typically, the <br>
topographically nearer the region, the more likely is it to take over the <br>
function of the affected area.<br>
