<p>
	This of course can be related to Anders post about being more<br>
creative when dead tired.  I myself have found that states of<br>
consciousness can bring with them intense experiences and open your mind<br>
to vast new worlds.  I have never experimented with psychedelic drugs,<br>
because I have never felt the need, I have been able to attain states of<br>
that rise me above "at the expense of the general intellect" to entirely<br>
new realms, purely through what I call "atmosphere engineering".  I find<br>
that electro/ambient/techno music, and a good deal of world music, in<br>
combination with a candle, or small suffusive night light, and<br>
sometimes by the soft glow of a monitor and endless depth of the 'net,<br>
allow me to easily shift states of consciousness.  I believe that the<br>
place in which you achieve this "exalted" state, the realm of higher<br>
creativity, is in middle to low alpha state.  Another great resource <br>
for helping achieve these results is biofeedback, eeg interpretation.<br>
It's not a coincidence that many primitive cultures around the world, both<br>
modern and ancient, have used rythmic drumming, chanting and dancing in<br>
rituals.  All of these methods help one more easily make the transition<br>
into alpha.  This is where sacred "visions" occur, mere hallucinations,<br>
but very powerful.  In this state, "conscious and unconscious fuse<br>
in a heightened realm of surreality", thoughts that you would not normally<br>
conceive of are allowed to float free.  It is said that what makes a<br>
genius is the ability to combine two entirely unrelated fields in new and<br>
unexplored ways.  Make note of the new issue of Wired, in it is featured<br>
software that analyzes something to the effect of three million or billion<br>
(I don't have it sitting next to me, so please excuse the vagueness)<br>
technical papers and looks for associations that would not normally have<br>
been found.  In this state, one thinks of some vary bizarre things, and<br>
can make associations.  What Anders experiences is probably just this, he<br>
is dead tired so is less able to maintain a grip on his beta state, and<br>
slips down into slight unconsciousness, rides the border, releasing a<br>
torrent of new and creative unforeseen ideas. <br>
	(I seem to have neglected the concept of paragraphs here, oops)<br>
If one uses this too often though, I believe that one can build a<br>
tolerance to it.  It may become easier to achieve alpha, but one maintains<br>
a higher level of conciousness, or self-awareness if practicing it too<br>
often, and they will realize that they are in alpha inhibiting more<br>
unconscious thoughts, rising them a bit more our of the state, which<br>
allows them to more fully grasp the situation, rising them...etc...It's a<br>
feedback loop that is very difficult to escape.  Go ahead, make a<br>
conscious effort not to think, can you do it?  These states are best<br>
achieved on a more spontaneous level, you can choose a rough time to<br>
experience it, but really you have to sit back and do something else and<br>
just allow your mind to slip.  That is why aids like ambient music and<br>
lighting are so beneficial.<br>
