CNN's computer connection featured a game input device which fits <br>
around your finger.  The result is that you can think about moving <br>
left or right and the game will respond in that way.  It works by<br>
measuring small fluctuations (electrical ?, movement ?) in the <br>
muscles on the side of your finger.  It was demonstrated to work only <br>
for left and right movement as well as measuring heart rate and skin <br>
resistance. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a device which interprets thoughts about moving left </i><br>
- right, to a functional "thought mouse" is not too great a leap.<br>
<p>
You could be just the person to do it.<br>
