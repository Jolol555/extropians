Sorry, but I can't resist this note to plug my article in the current issue<br>
of Rage (November): "Is God A Computer Nerd?". You'll find Rage somewhere<br>
near Penthouse.<br>
<p>
The article is an interview with Hans Moravec on the very topics you mention.<br>
<p>
Your post also reminds me that Hans new book, Mind Age, still hasn't<br>
appeared. Hans had said that he would publish it on the web if he couldn't<br>
reach a satisfactory agreement with his publisher. I'll ask him what's<br>
happening and report back here.<br>
