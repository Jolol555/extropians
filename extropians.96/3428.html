<i>&gt; </i><br>

Yeah, I knew it was you, I just wanted to see your response. In which<br>
case it surprises me that you would explode at me not telling you<br>
everything about the drive. Be sensible. If I am to ever make a buck off<br>
it, I need to keep the real important parts quiet for now. I would think<br>
that you would understand this.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, I will be putting up a nondisclosure agreement which<br>
people can download, print, sign, date, and notarize and snailmail back<br>
to me (sorry, PGP doesn't cut it in court yet). If anyone REALLY wants<br>
to know more, they can go through the rigamarole of showing they will<br>
keep my secrets. I would especially appreciate the input of people like<br>
yourself who are both proactive and rather analytical to help put the<br>
finishing touches on some things....<br>
TANSTAAFL!!!<br>
