        Sorry about responding to this thread so late...just catching up<br>
from a weekend away (intentional useless information).  In all seriousness,<br>
I had to read this thread's responses a couple times to make sure I was<br>
reading correctly.  If we were to have two extropian lists (open and<br>
closed), that would make the whole concept of extropy seem elitist.  I find<br>
that the term 'junk' is totally subjective...you should know the saying:<br>
"One man's junk is another man's treasure" and I believe that is true to<br>
conversation as well.  There have been no recent posts (IMO) that have not<br>
pertained to extropy in some way or another.  Sure, I disagree with personal<br>
flames and insults, but I think that if someone doesn't want to read an<br>
article by *insert name here*, I think that person can simply delete it<br>
before it is even read.<br>
<p>
        As for having an open\closed list etiquette, I strongly disagree.<br>
Who's to say what is signal and what is noise?  I think list members can<br>
filter the good from the bad on their own.  If there was to be a closed list<br>
as well as an open one, the people from the open list will all want to be<br>
'appointed' to the closed, and the people from the closed will pass judgment<br>
on the open-listers.  Isn't extropy based around libertarianism?  If we were<br>
to split the lists, it would be more like a two level hierarchy: the greater<br>
and the lesser.  That would just not be good.  My solution?  Leave it as it<br>
is and let the members 'excommunicate' their own responses.<br>

<p>
        I'm not sure about Benjamin Franklin, but I know that Pascal wrote:<br>
"The reason this letter is so long is because I didn't have time to make it<br>
shorter."  More useless information from one of the open-listers!  :-)<br>
