<p>
True, often they don't stay free because  armed men, called "governments", <br>
put a gun to your head, or threaten to, and force you to make economic <br>
decisions you would never do of your own free will. The result is that the <br>
only really free market is the black market, fortunately this seems to be <br>
taking up a larger and larger share of the economy.<br>
<p>
I think it's odd that people worry so much about the bad things that a  <br>
corporation might do someday, but ignore the HUGE evil that countries have <br>
actually done. Companies may sometimes be rough with their competition and  <br>
be rude to their employees and customers, but then don't put millions of <br>
people in death camps and then shove them into ovens.<br>
<p>
I don't think your worries about monopolies are well founded because the only  <br>
successful cartels in history are the ones that have government support. No  <br>
need to pass laws against monopolies, the market will stop them automatically:<br>
                 <br>
<p>
  Your company and mine produce all the steel made in the world. We make a   <br>
  good profit now, but we want more, so we get together and double our prices.   <br>
  Now we each make a huge profit on each ton of steel sold, so we would both   <br>
  like to make lots and lots of steel. However, because the price of steel is   <br>
  now very high demand is down, so part of our sinister plot must be an   <br>
  agreement to limit production. The higher the price gets, the greater is the   <br>
  temptation to secretly cheat on the agreement and produce more steel than   <br>
  was agreed to, and that would kill the cartel.<br>
<p>
  There are even more problems for our poor cartel. Now that the price of   <br>
  steel is sky high and the profits are huge, other companies will want to   <br>
  get in on the act and start making steel.  Also, consumers of steel will   <br>
  not want to shell out all that money for that metal and will start looking   <br>
  for replacement materials like wood or plastic or aluminum or composite   <br>
  fiber. <br>
                 <br>
<p>
No need to pass laws to protect the little guy, the market will do that <br>
automatically too:<br>
<p>
<p>
  I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% . I want to drive you   <br>
  out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then <br>
  I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you lose money on each widget <br>
  you sell, the trouble is I do to. I have 99 times as much money as you do,<br>
  but I'm losing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very <br>
  low, the demand for widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must <br>
  build more factories and increase production. I'm losing money faster and <br>
  faster,  meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory <br>
  and wait for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.                    <br>
  <br>
<p>
OK I will admit that one type of monopoly, called a "natural monopoly" would  <br>
work in a free market, but they don't bother me. In a few, very rare <br>
instances, the most efficient size of a factory is so big that there is only  <br>
room for one, the best example is aluminum production. A larger steel mill is  <br>
not more efficient than a smaller one, it's just bigger, but for physical  <br>
reasons that's not true for an aluminum plant, the bigger the better.<br>
<p>
However even a natural monopoly is limited to what it can do. If they rase  <br>
prices too high a competitor with a smaller factory will step in. The small  <br>
factory is not as efficient as the big one, but by accepting a smaller profit  <br>
margin they can still charge less for aluminum than the big company. And of <br>
course, there is always the competition from other materials. <br>
<p>
This logic did not phase the US government when in it's infinite wisdom it  <br>
decided to break up Alcoa Aluminum. What dreadful crime had Alcoa committed?  <br>
The government said it had kept competitors out. What dastardly method did  <br>
Alcoa use to do this? The government said Alcoa used the most advanced <br>
technology available to produce Aluminum that was just too cheap for  <br>
competitors to match. How very dreadful! I wish I was joking about this, but  <br>
I am not. If you can't beat them in the market place, lobby the government to  <br>
send in their goons to destroy your competition.<br>
                   <br>

<i>                &gt;Look at the software market, which is a free market, but is                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;dominated by MicroSoft to everyone's detriment. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Everybody loves to hate Microsoft, perfectly understandable, large <br>
concentrations of power make people uncomfortable, but the ONLY way to <br>
prevent  it is if there is an even larger concentration of power to put it <br>
out of business. The software industry is beyond doubt the fastest growing, <br>
most productive part of the world economy, but could it do even better? Sure <br>
it could, nothing is perfect, not even the free market, but can you really <br>
tell me with a straight face that the "help" of government bureaucrats would <br>
make  this sector of the economy grow even faster?<br>
<p>
Just how "detrimental" is Microsoft anyway? <br>
<p>
I've cursed at DOS just like everybody else, and I've looked at the Apple  <br>
system with some envy. So why isn't Apple the world standard instead of  <br>
fighting for it's life?<br>
<p>
I think it boils down to 2 things, the free market is not perfect and <br>
standards are hard to change. No point in denying it, the market is not <br>
perfect, but then neither are regulators, and it's ridicules to claim that a <br>
gaggle of politicians and bureaucrats are smarter, or more honest than market <br>
forces. Yes, standards are resistant to change, but that's OK because that is <br>
exactly what a standard should do. The lack of popularity of the  Apple  <br>
operating system is not an example of market failure because in the context <br>
of the real world it is in fact an inferior system. If everything  else was <br>
equal Apple  would be better than DOS\Windows but everything else is not <br>
equal. The Apple system has some small technical advantages but that is <br>
countered by enormous practical disadvantages, it will not operate on the  <br>
type of computer most people have and it will not  run billions of dollars <br>
worth of popular software. It's perfectly valid to take such things into  <br>
account when deciding what system is really superior.  <br>
<p>
When a standard is set it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get <br>
an astronomical improvement. That's why we still use feet, yards and pounds <br>
even though the metric system is better.  The market has decided that the <br>
Apple is not a huge advance that was worth the trouble of conversion, it <br>
could be wrong about that, but I think the  market has a better understanding  <br>
of such things than a bunch of hack  politicians.<br>
                                               <br>

<i>                &gt;What is needed is some kind of "institutionalization of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;experimentation" -- some kind of overall structure to                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;prevent the spontaneous emergence of repressive governmental                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and corporate structures.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Whatever this  "institutionalization" is it will have to be far larger and <br>
far more powerful than any corporation and that is a recipe for repression, <br>
it is also a recipe for poverty. We can design an airliner so we can make it  <br>
fly in any direction we want just by moving a few controls, can we do the <br>
same thing with an economy and point it in the direction of prosperity? No,<br>
because nobody can understand the economy in which they live, the more they  <br>
understand it the more they change it. Airliners are ridiculously simple  <br>
machines compared a human being, and a human being is a ridiculously simple   <br>
machine compared to a modern healthy economy.        <br>
<p>
You can control a plane because it has an enormous mass compared to air,  and <br>
it's moving at an enormous speed, and drag will not slow it to a stop because <br>
it has an enormous engine, so it's easy to make a prediction about how the <br>
plane will behave when the control surfaces are in a particular orientation. <br>
Also, when you learn more about the airplane that doesn't cause the plane to <br>
change. The idea that an equivalent economic machine could be built and that <br>
our fearless leader could  just "point and shoot" it in the direction of <br>
prosperity  and  provide individual freedom as a bonus is just plain loony.                 <br>
<p>
We don't need the State, Anarchy is very workable, (just look at the Internet)  <br>
its the best way to get things done. It's true that large projects can't be <br>
accomplished without good organization, but government is not the only way to <br>
get organized, or the best. A command economy, the kind governments like, is <br>
inherently inefficient. If you doubt this just look at the pitiful situation <br>
in Eastern Europe. Even if we make the ridiculous assumption that all <br>
politicians are honest and have boiling water IQ's they could never do as <br>
good a job as the free market because they are lacking a vital ingredient, <br>
price information. The true price of an object is determined by an enormous <br>
number of variables and is much too complicated to be calculated from first <br>
principles, but the market will tell you what the price should be, no trouble <br>
at all.  Whenever you change jobs, travel or make a purchase you are casting <br>
a vote and sending an exquisitely sensitive message to the economy to change <br>
in a way you want. In a Democracy all you can do is vote for a grab bag of <br>
promises every 4 years.<br>
