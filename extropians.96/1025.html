 Why don't people like FM-2030 and Marvin Minsky continue to read the list?<br>
 Did they disagree with some newly accepted principle or are just too damn<br>
busy?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I think people like FM-2030 and Marvin Minsky DO read this list.  People with<br>
the  prior history of "speaking-their-minds" will comment when they think it<br>
is worth the time.  I don't believe these particular people strongly disagree<br>
with some new Extropian principle.  I'm sure they have plenty of comments . .<br>
.  a  book's worth, of comments.  Which leads to the time factor.  Many<br>
people reading this list, such as the above people, write books and give<br>
lectures.   I just sent in the final editing on a book I started July 1994.<br>
 Using every available minute, working until 1:30 AM and getting interrupted<br>
too many times.  Now I can rest.  Not really.  I've got another book started.<br>
 Which reminds me . . . Sorry I have to go now.  (No wonder it took me 2 yeas<br>
to write that book.)  :-)<br>
