        I can't help but close my eyes, snicker, and shake my head when I<br>
read this kind of response.  I feel like I'm caught in some sort of<br>
semi-conversant<br>
paradox.  As *I* recall, I agreed with whoever it was that said they would<br>
not want to be uploaded to exist solely as intellect.  To me, it seems kind<br>
of edeist; that is to say, like a low-level cult mentality.  No offense<br>
intended, Ira, but would you truly like to be intellect and nothing else?<br>
You most certainly would not be alive.  Conciousness is another matter.  I<br>
seriously can't grok the concept that an extropian would want to forfeit<br>
their life for eternal existance --such a huge line between existance and<br>
life.  I can understand that being pure intellect is "better than nothing",<br>
but personally (and I believe I am speaking for most extropian types) I<br>
would rather be more than that.  If I could copy my conciousness as well as<br>
my intellect, that would be almost ideal.  I rather like being able to<br>
access my information, as opposed to just having it there...stranded.  Like<br>
a person with short-term amnesia: has the memory, just can't access it.  I<br>
don't anything hedonistic about that, just optimistic objectivism.<br>
