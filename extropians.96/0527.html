<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;You are kidding, aren't you?  5 years?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Ok so maybe I was a little over optimistic :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I guess I was a little euphoric over the success of the current Hotwired</i><br>
<i>&gt;thread.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How is the thread a success, in the larger scheme of things?  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;does "success" mean in this context?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Besides which, seen from my own extropian perspective, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;unnecessarily bellicose to talk of annihilation of competing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;memesets.  Better to speak of ours "outcompeting" theirs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Yeah but wouldn't outcompeting mean annihilation? We need to spread the meme</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as far and wide as possible to get it to the masses as quickly as possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; so as to speed things up even more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This won't happen if you express your desired outcomes in the language</i><br>
<i>&gt;of destruction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[SNIP]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; All threads must die eventually. Now that the main debate between Max and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Paulina is over, the thread will wither and die because there is no one to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; direct it and prevent it from becoming a general topic zone. Maybe you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; joined the thread a little too late. Sorry.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;-- End of quoted excerpt from Chris Hind</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pardon?  I was referring to a _peak time_ in the thread.</i><br>
<p>
What is all this?!?! You're argueing the definition of success? My<br>
definition of success is the gradual dying off of all other memes and the<br>
extropian meme replacing them via rational thought and logic - not force.<br>
This IS how success is measured in evolution isn't it?<br>
