<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Alas, some of us may think that the strong concept of the Singularity is</i><br>
<i>&gt; more cultish than general extropianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; }       The easiest argument to understand.  Attention-catcher.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And the easiest to doubt has predictive power.  And I think Eugene,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps among others, has challenged the metric of "power" used.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt; 2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.</i><br>
<i>&gt; }       Another easy argument.  Both give the flavor of the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This gives it best, I think.  However, as whether any intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplification has yet happened, let alone whether it would be recursive,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not fully accepted here, this may not be a convincing argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } We are creating and packaging a meme and our sole goal</i><br>
<i>&gt; } is that it infect a majority of the human race ASAP!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, I guess this answers my question.  How will Bangladeshi and African</i><br>
<i>&gt; peasants respond to this meme package?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } Can I have some constructive criticism of the *outline*,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about of purpose?  Okay, so I haven't been that constructive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry.  A bit hard to be, when I'm leaning toward a vague idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Universal Self-Aware Turning Machines as a refinement of the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Universal Turing Machines, which removes the philosophical (although not</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely the practical) point of the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And I wonder about the statement that "a human from only a few thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; years ago couldn't understand our society".  Many, perhaps most, would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be terribly confused, true.  But a child from then (we assume) would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; no different from our children raised now, and I suspect that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have been some people, flexible of mind, who could have adjusted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, that raises a point I hadn't thought of before.  Is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Singularity supposed to be incomprehensible to a human raised in/beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; it?  This certainly wasn't necessarily the case for Vinge -- "Original</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sin" and "Just Peace" are set post-Singularity, yet the star humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually seem more or less unaugmented.  It is their tools that don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; make sense, particularly in "Original Sin".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
If you read "Original Sin" carefully, you see that (hold on, thats the<br>
one on Shiva, right?) humans only take on "human" aka material form when<br>
dealing with more primitive races like the Shivans, who are still in a<br>
presingularity world. Quotes like "remember spaceships?", and "we are<br>
projecting an image of what the Shivans would imagine a space battleship<br>
would look like" show that humans no longer use such antiquated<br>
technology.<br>
<p>
Is "Just Peace" the one set on New Canada ? If so, carefully read the<br>
first section, on the agent's arrival, as well as many of his internal<br>
subvocalizations about life back on earth.<br>
<p>
As for appearing unaugmented, that woud be a natural outgrowth of any<br>
Prime Directive with regard to presingularity cultures: you must appear<br>
unaugmented. Besides, I would imagine that the more sophisticated<br>
technology would require just as sophisticated support technology, which<br>
would be unavailable on primitive worlds like Shiva or New Canada. in<br>
the case of New Canada, the colonists would have chosen no augmentation<br>
in order to become the new adams and eves of a new world. Also, remember<br>
the agent saying "If I'm killed, another copy will not be sent again" or<br>
words to that effect. Why? because he knows that his analogue on earth<br>
and all the people he left are not going to be even comprehensible, as<br>
they are starting on the steep part of the Singularity, and probalby<br>
won't even be in this universe in a few years.<br>
