I very recently thought of an interesting mega-scale engineering project that <br>
I've never heard suggested before.  To be cost-effective, it will require a <br>
certain level of nanotechnology (although not the genie-in-a-box variety).  I <br>
was thinking: why not enclose the entire earth, atmosphere included, in one <br>
big shell, which is grounded in place by several large posts that reach from <br>
the upper atmosphere, down to the hard surface of the earth.  The posts could <br>
even be huge cities, if desired, and they could provide an elevator to the <br>
outside (using space-ships that are propelled by magnetic fields, similar to <br>
the way maglev trains work).  Now, the first problem with this is that the sun <br>
would be blocked out and we'd all die.  But, this problem can be overcome by <br>
coating the outside of the shell with solar cells to gather energy and coating <br>
the inner layer of the shell with lights that emit the same spectrum that the <br>
sun does (or even a more desirable spectum, if we want).  We can also build <br>
huge fins on the outside of the shell, which are also coated with solar <br>
collectors, to gather even more energy, to be used however we desire.<br>
<p>
The shell could be built to be very strong, strong enough to provide us <br>
adequate protection from very large asteroids (perhaps we could even surround <br>
the earth with probes that watch out for and explode any large asteroids or <br>
meteors that are approaching earth, so that the shell gets hit by many small <br>
fragments, spread out, rather than having all of its momentum concentrated in <br>
a small area, which could pierce the shell.)  The shell could also be very <br>
insulating, to keep a great deal of our heat energy inside, rather than <br>
allowing it to be expelled into space so quickly.  Since we're controlling how <br>
much energy is being radiated from the lights overhead, we could regulate the <br>
temperature.  We could also build devices which pull extra heat out of the air <br>
and store it for later use.  We would have excellent climate control, as we <br>
could regulate the temperature and amount of light received in various areas.  <br>
If we wanted, we could make the whole earth warmer and more suitable for a <br>
greater abundance of living things.  The polar ice-caps would melt, but that's <br>
not a serious problem because we could build enormous areas of land which <br>
float on the ocean and provide more landspace for living things.  We could <br>
also provide lights on the underside of the floating landmasses so that the <br>
ocean life would continue to flourish and not be shaded by the land.  We could <br>
also provide considerable air space under the floating landmasses for <br>
creatures which like to come to the surface and take a breath of air.  Hell, <br>
we could even provide landmasses under the landmasses, for creatures to crawl <br>
upon and live on.<br>
<p>
Now, I'm having the idea that we could make several levels of shells, with <br>
lots of space between shells, and we could have the outside surface of each <br>
shell coated with a thick layer of land as well as oceans and other bodies of <br>
water.  We could have several concentric biospheres.  We would gather energy <br>
from the sun and transfer the appropriate amount to the lights on each level.  <br>
And if we need more energy, we can build bigger fins.  We can also use nuclear <br>
power, of course.  Another way to get energy is to drill very deeply into the <br>
earth and use the heat energy there.<br>
<p>
For all these biosphere shells, we need lots of materials.  We can get them <br>
from the earth and from other sources, such as the asteroid belt, the moon.  I <br>
have nothing against taking apart mercury or venus or any of the other planets <br>
and using them also.  Eventually, we could keep taking material from the crust <br>
of the earth to build new biosphere levels, use the heat energy of the lower <br>
layers, and as they cool off, use that material to build more shells and <br>
continue working in until the entire earth is turned into one huge, <br>
multi-leveled, life-filled starship.  <br>
<p>
I'm still trying to figure out what the gravitational pull would be like in <br>
the center-most layers, since they would pretty much be surrounded with lots <br>
of mass.  I'm thinking that the gravitational effect would be effectively <br>
cancelled out down there since any mass in there would be getting pulled <br>
nearly the same amount in every direction.<br>
<p>
The earth would be much larger than it is right now, and it would probably <br>
keep expanding as we added new layers.  We may make its orbit larger as it <br>
grows more massive.  If we find some way to generate sufficient energy without <br>
the sun, we could even leave the sun behind and fly the planet around the <br>
universe wherever we wanted to.  Or, even better, pull the hydrogen and helium <br>
off the sun, use some kind of large fusion device to transform the hydrogen <br>
and helium into whatever atoms we wanted and use them to continue expanding <br>
the earth.<br>
<p>
Now that we have the general idea of how this goes, I think it would be better <br>
to have *many* of these kind of structures, which keep expanding and making <br>
more room for life, rather than just one.  This would allow for more diverse <br>
types of biospheres and would be a good safeguard, in case something goes <br>
horribly wrong in one of them.  Then, when all the matter in this solar system <br>
has being used by life, we can start travelling around to other star systems <br>
and make use of the matter that exists there. <br>
<p>
There was a thread going where someone was saying the life would transform <br>
itself into a neutron star and just sit where it was and compute away, not <br>
sending out any probes because they would be too costly.  It may not send out <br>
probes, but I don't see why it wouldn't propell itself around to various star <br>
systems and grab up all the matter and energy there.  Certainly *that* would <br>
be cost-effective.<br>
<p>
Well, these are just some more ideas to get us thinking.  Of course, there's <br>
lots of variations of these ideas that one could follow, and I'd be interested <br>
to read any that any of you come up with.<br>
