Ever played 'Doom'? I know it's not real, but I've still spent days in<br>
that universe and had a lot of fun in the process. I can't prove that the<br>
universe I'm in now is 'real', but I still have fun here. <br>

Email, or something like it. If the two AIs transfer complete messages<br>
then the faster AI would just spend less time processing the<br>
communication. Just as today some humans seem to think much faster than<br>
others. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The elite would have the highest processing speed and the poor</i><br>

<p>
Just as today some people are smarter (faster) than others.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; timeslices.</i><br>
<p>
Actually it would be easier because the faster AIs could commuicate with <br>
several slow AIs simultaneously.<br>
