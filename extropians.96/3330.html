<i>&gt;&lt;So we arrive back at the Great Filter problem.  The dinosaurs lived on </i><br>
<i>&gt;earth for millions of years, but never evolved into tool-using creatures. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Terence McKenna has suggested that when our ancestors discovered </i><br>
<i>&gt;psychedelic mushrooms, that stimulated them to start thinking, talking, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;using tools.  That was when they broke through the filter and started </i><br>
<i>&gt;making progress.  Without mushrooms, we could have been stuck in an </i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary cul de sac for eons, like the dinosaurs.&gt;</i><br>

I watched a show once where they suggested that it was the introduction of<br>
seafood into the proto-human diet between 4 and 7 million years ago that<br>
triggered the increase in intelligence.  The diets of most primates are<br>
lacking in several important neuro-active and bio-active compounds directly<br>
involved in higher brain functions.  Many of these compounds are generally<br>
only found abundantly in nature in seafoods.  <br>
<p>
Several studies have been done on the impact of diet on intelligence.  The<br>
lack of seafood in a diet (especially from saltwater sources) has been shown<br>
to have direct impacts on the average intelligence of a population.  These<br>
compounds are especially important during childhood.<br>
<p>
Iodine is a case in point.  Naturally, iodine is found almost exclusively in<br>
seafood sources.  There is a region in inland China where 1 in 8 people is<br>
technically mentally retarded, and few people in the region have "normal"<br>
intelligence.  As a whole, the average IQ of people in this region is far<br>
below the human average.  The reason has been determined to be iodine<br>
deficiency.  They have no access to sources of iodine in their diet.  They<br>
are genetically normally, but lack of a key compound has rendered them less<br>
intelligent than their genetically determined capability.  Unfortunately,<br>
the effects of this are structural and irreversible.<br>
<p>
Fortunately for many developed countries, iodine is artificially introduced<br>
into the diet so that this is not a problem.  This may also be why countries<br>
with high seafood diets also are among the highest in raw IQ as well.<br>
<p>
The introduction nootropics into the proto-human diet was very likely<br>
responsible for the advance of our species.  I don't know too much about the<br>
mushroom theory, but the seafood theory does seem plausible.  AFAIK, humans<br>
are the only primates that eat seafood.<br>
