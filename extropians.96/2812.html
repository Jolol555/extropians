While I agree with you that any mere human would not bea able to<br>
accurately convey the representation of a true POWER in his books, as we<br>
have never even seen one, and most of what they do wuld be unfathomable<br>
in any case. However, I greately dissagree with your contention that<br>
they would be as godlike as you claim. Any intelligence wishing to<br>
retain existence in this universe will have to obey the laws of this<br>
universe, even if they use what seem like loopholes like FTL, etc, they<br>
would still be part of the laws. <br>
<p>
And ANY intelligence can only make evaluations based on information<br>
available that is known to be true, or known to be false. As we see in<br>
the current internet, there is a high level of disinformation out there,<br>
of varying levels of truthfulness; the situation would be no different<br>
on a galactic level, probably even worse. Any information that you don't<br>
know to be true or false is basically worthless, while mixed value is<br>
even worse. _AFUTD_ was I think rather representative as to what we at<br>
our current level could possibly understand about such events. The fact<br>
that "mere" humans outmaneuvered a great power had more to do with being<br>
in person as opposed to acting by proxy,  plus the fact that they had<br>
their own help from a great power.<br>
<p>
In the end, even Vinge himself admits that the only reason he created<br>
the concept of the Zones was because he (accurately) forsees humanity<br>
transcending rather rapidly within the next 50 years or so, which leaves<br>
a very small window of opportunity to get enough humans into<br>
interstellar space to be around in events written to be over 50,000<br>
years in our future. He needed a gimmick to prevent us from<br>
transcending  too soon.<br>
