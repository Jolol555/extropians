When it comes down to common extropian tech like nano or biotech, this<br>
list is likely to matter very little.  A few people might matter, if<br>
they're working hard in those fields, but the dominant force is general<br>
academic, corporate, and military research.  For precisely the same<br>

highly productive and seek to profit from them themselves.  (Arrgh.  Our<br>

Hero's steam toy that needed spreading; it was an idea of using machines<br>
to save labor, and that such would be worthwhile.  Our society has this<br>
idea, and looks for such tools.  Gerontology and related research is<br>
also picking up, I think.<br>

If there are fields that need attention, they would be AI, because it<br>
hasn't been too promising; spontaneous order solutions, because most<br>
people these days aren't used to thinking of such as potentially<br>
superior to centrally directed solutions; and above all cryonics,<br>
because most people don't see the point or feasibility or general<br>
profitability.<br>

Unless you care to some extent about equality of results, in which case<br>
it is the field of social justice that needs attention above all.<br>

Really?  I could use a gradual transition myself.  If a complex<br>
Singularity happens, it'd be nice to think I'd have some skill to adapt<br>
or at least understand what was going on.  I certainly still have much<br>
to learn -- not to become fully competent, but to at least have a working<br>
idea of as many fields as possible.  You ready to meet the Powers?<br>

Brrr.  You know, I've seen rather little millenial fervor, all things<br>
considered.  Stuff in the Weekly World News, the TV show Max More and<br>
Greg Stock were in, but not much else.  Perhaps I've been out of it.<br>
But if I'm right: guys, I *like* it this way.  _Don't_ stir things up.<br>
If people start going gaga over the year 2000 we'd get lost in the<br>
storm; 3 years of heavy duty extropian advertising couldn't compete with<br>
thousands of years of superstition -- I won't drag formal religion into<br>
this, it doesn't deserve it.  So far it looks like we might tiptoe past<br>
the millenium, compared to what went off in 1000 AD or even 1900.<br>
Spiffy.  Shhh.<br>
