<p>
IAN: Right. I see what your saying, and have to concede to its logic: <br>
any proclamation we make regarding what "ownership" is, is merely <br>
a subjective claim, ipso facto.<br>
<p>
Of all possible claims about ownership claims, I'd say that the claim<br>
that "ownership is a claim to physical property that is manifest via<br>
the manipulation and demarcation of said property," is the most<br>
concrete and physically testable. However, in accord with your <br>
point, this does not make my claim more "true" than even <br>
the most doctrinaire Polkadotian property claims.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; IAN: So your saying that ... [lots of good stuff snipped]</i><br>

<i> &gt; Don't you dare question the teachings of Polkadot!  You will be</i><br>

<i> &gt; she has currently contracted out to the legions of devilbunnies,</i><br>
<i> &gt; and you don't want to mess with them. :-)</i><br>
<p>
IAN: Sounds perfectly frightful.  Please don't throw me to <br>
the devilbunnies (I've been very bad) please don't, PLEASE !<br>
