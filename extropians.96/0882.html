<i>&gt;This gives me the opportunity to pose a question about such motivations. </i><br>
<i>&gt;I, for one, am not convinces that a future AI civilization (or overlordship</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a single such entity) will be inexorably driven to dismantle and convert</i><br>
<i>&gt;all available resources in the system--including Earth.  Such a process is</i><br>
<i>&gt;could just as likely be a distraction from it's purpose as in support of it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;But usually, the motivation of &lt;consume and grow/reproduce&gt; is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;function of the lower mind (or no mind at all), basic but controllable,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially for higher intellectual pursuits or complex cultural gratification.</i><br>
What if we were to assimilate all the resources of planet earth and make a<br>
molecular map of the Earth inside a virtual world so that you could let the<br>
ecology run free without all the people but the real material Earth would<br>
have long since been dismantled and converted to resources. We could do this<br>
to every planet we came along past. Much like VGR in Star Trek: The Motion<br>
Picture where inside it contained entire star systems recreated inside it.<br>
This way we would lose nothing while still gaining resources.<br>
