Um.  I'm not an expert, but I'm not sure how useful rRNA is here.  One<br>
model of eukarya is that a magnetobacterium swallowed an archaean and<br>
turned it into its nucleus, with similar swallowings for famously the<br>
mitochondria and chloroplasts.  I mean, I know rRNA is used for the<br>
phylogenetic trees but I'm not sure how it would distinguish here.  Also<br>
that there may be some assumptions of uniformity, and I'm not sure how<br>
robust the method is to some past deviation we couldn't see.<br>
<p>
And given that eukarya certainly _do_ contain prokaryotic mitochondria I<br>
cannot see the validity of the "self-organization" statement.  Prokarya<br>
possibly require an RNA replicator hijacking a fat globule, or<br>
coacervate.  Eukarya build on that.<br>
