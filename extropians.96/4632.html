        If you believe that, why are you on this list?  If you believe that<br>
there must be a leader, then you are inevitably saying that there must be<br>
followers.  One of the underlying pillars of libertarianism is the idea of<br>
non-serviam: I Will Not Follow.  When certain facets of a philosophy are<br>
lost or forgotten, the philosophy in question has a tendency to fester.  For<br>
example: Marx's ideas of communism were different from the way communism was<br>
later perceived; hence the difference between Marxism and communism.  What I<br>
(and many others) have been seeing on this list lately is a transgression<br>
from extropy to some varied ideas on a cultish 'progress' movement relying<br>
on media and irrational radical conformism.  Not something I would like to<br>
be part of, thanks.  People who have been on the list for years are starting<br>
to leave...and I'm sad to say that I can't blame them.  When I read a post<br>
such as this, the exact words that enter my mind are: "What the Hell are you<br>
talking about?"  The bottom line is that I am not the only one who feels<br>
this way.<br>
