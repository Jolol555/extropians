Reilly Jones.<br>

<i>&gt;Good question.  I get the creeps any time I see the word "tolerance" any more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The word has been badly abused by the holier-than-thou politically correct</i><br>
<i>&gt;brigades, who virtually always mean "intolerance" when they use it.  Likewise,</i><br>
<i>&gt;when they say "inclusive," they mean "exclusive"; when they say</i><br>
"multicultural,"<br>
<i>&gt;they mean "monocultural"; when they say "open-minded," they mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;"closed-minded"; and when they say "diversity," they mean "perversity."</i><br>
<p>
I don't believe you. Please give some concrete examples to prove your point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But I</i><br>
<i>&gt;digress.  Really, tolerance in practice is simply indifference.  To tolerate</i><br>
<i>&gt;something is to be indifferent to it, meaning it does not threaten your person</i><br>
<i>&gt;or your way of life (which is nearly inseparable from your person) and holds no</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest to you.</i><br>
<p>
Nope. A lot of tolerance involves 'putting up with' something which does<br>
affect your way of life, and which you are not indifferent to. One may<br>
tolerate having a low wage because one loves one's job, but that doesn't<br>
mean indifference towards being paid a low wage. One may tolerate a straight<br>
flat-mate's lover, because of respect for the freedoms of that flat-mate,<br>
but that doesn't imply an indifference to heterosexuality. (Sorry, couldn't<br>
resist that twist :-) Etc... Hence the OED definition 'endure', 'endure with<br>
forbearance', etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This indifference, when applied to other humans, can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;miserable.  As Santayana pointed out: "[T]olerated people are never</i><br>
conciliated.<br>
<i>&gt;They live on, but the aroma of their life is lost."</i><br>
<p>
I agree that 'toleration' has an intrinsic connotation of 'otherness'; and<br>
that conciliation requires an overcoming of the feelings of 'forbearance'<br>
which are required to satify a definition of toleration. But note that this<br>
supports my argument above: if toleration equated to indifference,<br>
conciliation would be unecessary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If something threatens your</i><br>
<i>&gt;person or your way of life, no reasonable argument can be made that we should</i><br>
<i>&gt;tolerate it, to roll over and let it have its way with you, without</i><br>
resorting to<br>
<i>&gt;the fiction that the group is of higher worth than the individual.  Worth to</i><br>
<i>&gt;who?</i><br>
<p>
Again no. In both my examples above, toleration is based on the balancing of<br>
feelings of the individual, for hir own personal happiness. These are<br>
personal decisions based on personal feelings, they do not require recourse<br>
to the concept of group-worth. That, of course, does not mean that you or I<br>
or others have to agree with a person's choice to tolerate, but then, none<br>
of us has to agree to anything, do we? <br>
<p>
It's not a question of a threat to the person or to one's way of life,<br>
that's too simplistic. It's to do with the nature of that threat, and a<br>
personal balancing of priorities and desires.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt; (schools in the US are not within my sphere of knowledge)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Jeff again: &lt;Or does it simply mean 'acknowledging that there is a degree of</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncertainty in all ideas, and dealing with that rationally'?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It most certainly does not mean this, since many ideas are held with certainty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is, not a shred of doubt to them.</i><br>
<p>
Practically (and I'm a practical kinda gal) I think this is true. There are<br>
probably deep epistomological debates to be had in this area, but I ain't<br>
gonna start them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The instant you have a doubt about something,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you are uncertain.  There are different degrees of doubt, therefore, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;different degrees of uncertainty, but there is only one degree of certainty.</i><br>
<p>
Yep.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...but only one thing happens at any given instant of time.</i><br>
<p>
Question: is time continuous or discrete? I thought time was quantum in<br>
nature, with the minimum possible interval of time being related to Planck's<br>
constant (h/2pi?). But I only dimly remember reading that, and I can't find<br>
the reference, so I may be wrong (which I'm quite willing to accept). If I'm<br>
right, then more than one thing can happen at any given instant of time.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;Dejan again: &lt;So I must be out of this world since I'm spending months</i><br>
<i>&gt;studying errors of measurement in order to publish a paper about some</i><br>
<i>&gt;facts I measured in less than a week?&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On the face of it, yes.  Unless its part of some strange, esoteric initiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;rite you have to pass in order to put food on your table.  &lt;g&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I'm assuming the reply here based around the &lt;g&gt; rather than a serious<br>
comment, since assessment of measurement error is clearly so fundamental to<br>
the scientific method.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I see there's been further discussion since this, on the nature of experiments,</i><br>
<i>&gt;so I'll just add a tidbit about it.  I haven't seen the word "theory" come up</i><br>
<i>&gt;yet, so let me say that an experiment can't be an experiment without a theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;that not only predicts what will happen, but specifies what effects caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the experiment will count as evidence, before the experiment is conducted.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Observation, meaning no predictions are involved, still must have some theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;behind it, or else what is to be recorded as having been observed?</i><br>
<p>
I don't believe theories predict what will happen, they only predict what<br>
might happen. Otherwise they wouldn't be theoretical.<br>
<p>
To say observation needs a theory behind it is not true. Observation often<br>
leads to discovery: it is an error of causality to say observation _must_<br>
have some theory behind it; it is quite possible for the theory to evolve<br>
from the observation. The theory, and the validity of that theory, may, of<br>
course, be refined and checked by further observation and/or experiment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This gets to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the difficulty that the "soft" sciences have...</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
