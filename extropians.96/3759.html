<i>&gt;I think it is essential to multitrack when designing such an extropic space. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Here are some ideas for possible "areas" or "locales"- </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;- General background setting - cryogenic vaults, parkland walks, office</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"buildings" </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Office buildings are becoming antiquated.  Future offices will be anywhere,</i><br>
<i>&gt;anytime.  Designing a skyscraper office building probably will not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;realistic. </i><br>
<p>
Good point.  But a sleek, futuristic glass and steel <br>
skyscraper could still add to the atmosphere, and<br>
represent a symbolic connection with business and commerce.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another area that we will see falling by the wayside are art galleries or</i><br>
<i>&gt;museums, as known today. A museum could house a look at past cultures - art</i><br>
<i>&gt;history.  Because art has been changing its "form," artefacts to hang on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;wall will not be the art of the future.  Art such as 3-D images or</i><br>
<i>&gt;holograms, VR interfaces or liquid mobile sculptures will appear at anytime,</i><br>
<i>&gt;anywhere.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes I agree.  But buildings themselves will probably not become totally<br>
obsolete...they will however change there shape to suit what new uses they<br>
will be put to.<br>
When I talk about libraries, museums, institutes, office<br>
buildings, I'm speaking in the loosest possible sense,<br>
architecturally.  The reason I included physical structures is to convey a<br>
sense of time and place; a library for example will in the future probably<br>
come to play a more symbolic than functional role; in a virtual space like<br>
the one proposed, since everything is by definition symbolic anyways, the<br>
library is the place whose entrance you click on to get to some hypertext<br>
links, and as <br>
such it should be recognizable as a library.  Of course that doesn't mean we<br>
should design it like libraries of the past,<br>
just that we shouldn't dispense altogether with having it there.<br>
<p>
I totally agree with your point about fluidity and anytime,<br>
anywhere.  We should plan from the outset in ways of animating<br>
things, building the principles of dynamism and change into<br>
everything thing we can...the place should positively<br>
glow with life, information, possibility, extropy...<br>
 <br>
One idea would be having "Wild-Areas" just outside the main area, where the<br>
landscape, objects, and features are always shifting, where artificial<br>
lifeforms and evolutionary art-entities breed and mutate and fractal<br>
tidepools swirl...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;that are holding us back are faster physical connections to Internet ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Just start drafting an idea.</i><br>
<p>
I shall...I'm already amazed at the great responses<br>
both the criticisms and the general comments have<br>
been constructive and enthusiastic...<br>
