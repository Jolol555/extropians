This is not my experience, although i am aware of <br>
what you mean.  I think that in every situation it is<br>
fairly true that how you treat others has a lot to do<br>
with the way you are treated. I have been dealing with<br>
state agencies lately and they have been so courteous<br>
and helpful _ and they dont have to be, it was the <br>
INDIVIDUAL personality that made them that way.<br>
<p>
I see that you may be saying that govt. jobs may not <br>
encourage people to do their solid best, but that could<br>
be stated without "dehumanizing" every worker that <br>
works for the state. Look, job to job,  people are people. <br>
There are shitty people working for many kinds of<br>
companies, not just govt. ones. Ever talk to MSN?<br>
 <br>
But everyone in the USA knows about the NOTORIOUS <br>
slowness and insolence at post office and DMV, so i <br>
understand what you are getting at.  Even at those<br>
 places I have been treated well, and it is the exception<br>
 to the rule, i am sure. But I am awfully courteous and respectful myself,<br>
and i love people. You get what you<br>
give. You give love, you get love, etc.<br>
Your  point was a valid one: if people are forced to <br>
buy from you - you dont have to be competent. We need a<br>
change.<br>
But lets not replace old memes with more negativity, hatred and inhumanity. <br>
