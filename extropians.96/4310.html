The age old meme "Ignorance is Bliss" or "What you don't know can't hurt<br>
you" are quite obviously blatantly incorrect but also finding a logical<br>
structure for everything takes from the environment and experience. When we<br>
upload we will have control over our brains and have the ability to<br>
basically 'dumb ourselves up' for a particular experience. To state an<br>
example, How would we experience a new universe someone created if we knew<br>
that it wasn't real and we could manipulate it anyway we want? Sitting on a<br>
jagged cliff overlooking an endless sea with the breeze blowing across your<br>
face wouldn't seem so realistic if you knew you could simply flip the whole<br>
experience off like a switch. Perhaps to experience new realms we will have<br>
to dumb ourselves up so we don't pick out petty little details and think<br>
about the situation logically. Also there may be an uploading speed limit<br>
agreed upon by the mass population for dealing with other uploaded<br>
individuals because how could two people communicate if they were running<br>
at different processing speeds? People could communicate at a middle<br>
processing speed in which they would collaborate with their fellow workers,<br>
make appointments, etc and they could run at whatever speed they wished as<br>
spare time. Also won't this system turn into a bunch of uploaded haves and<br>
have nots? The elite would have the highest processing speed and the poor<br>
would have low processing speeds. It would be very nearly impossible to<br>
contact someone with a higher speed than you which means that the poor<br>
would have a more difficult time climbing to the top and have to steal<br>
timeslices. (Am I going a little too far?)<br>
