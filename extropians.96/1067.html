<p>
It's not intended to imply that we can't understand it, only that we<br>
can't predict much about any of the details with any degree of certainty.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My point is that everything costs something.</i><br>
<p>
Or, just as validly, everything costs nothing.  After all, when you look<br>
at the component costs of the items underlying some "costed" enterprise,<br>
you'll find that they in turn rely on others, and they on others, and so<br>
on, in an infinite regress.  At the end of it all, there is nothing ...<br>
just the time that individuals spend on doing things.  If they did not<br>
need to pay to survive then nothing material would cost anything. :-)<br>
<p>
[Non-tangible items may be somewhat different, debateably: eg. uniqueness.]<br>
<p>
It's only the vicious circle created by Man himself that attributes<br>
costs to items.  That was a very valid thing to do in a world where<br>
time is limited to just a few decades apiece and where almost nothing<br>
can be achieved in a material sense without involving others.  That<br>
basis for costs disappears when everyman can create cross-continental<br>
engineering works (as in my saltwater pipeline example) without any<br>
outside involvement nor extra resources nor any other expense.  We'll<br>
just have to wait and see what happens:  there is certainly quite a<br>
major discontinuity heading our way, even without nano goo scenarios.<br>
