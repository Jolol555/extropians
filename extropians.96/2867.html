<i>&gt; At my knowledge, the Logban (or Lojban) supporters haven't yet </i><br>

<p>
No, I could be wrong about the book.  But there was definitely an <br>
article in Scientific American, which I still have, but I can't find it <br>
right now.  It was called Loglan, as in log-ical lan-guage.  Loglan. <br>
<p>
There is a classic story called "Gulf" by Robert Heinlein, about a <br>
secret society of scientists, who invented an artificial language to <br>
increase their intelligence.  Highly recommended.  <br>
<p>
By the way, Walter, you really must look up the difference between <br>
"septic" and "skeptic."  <br>
