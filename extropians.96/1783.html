<i>&gt;&gt;&lt;"When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber."  --Winston</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Churchill&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It means that while the parrots are sitting around squawking, the birds of<br>
prey are silently watching from above.<br>
<p>
Obviously, Churchill did know "how rarely eagles speak when away from their<br>
highly-situated nests."  That's the point.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
I'm not sure that's actually Churchill's point. Consider...<br>
<p>
A very basic rhetorical rewording of the actual quote might be:<br>
  "Unless the eagles <br>
(in conventional mythology, they're high-status symbols of freedom; <br>
symbolically akin to ideal citizens of a free state) <br>
  speak <br>
(which they, proud birds that they mythologically are, rarely do), <br>
  the parrots <br>
(mythically comical, stupid, non-raptorial, non-high status, given to <br>
mere raucousness and mimicry--symbolically akin to monkeys) <br>
  squawk."<br>
<p>
No soaring or predation needed. So what did Churchill mean?<br>
<p>
Without more context, I would only be guessing--I could guess that he <br>
meant the eagles to be Allied statesmen or military staff, and the parrots <br>
to be the press, or perhaps just the yellow journalists. That sounds like the <br>
kind of thing Churchill would let himself be quoted as having said. <br>
:) :) <br>
