<i>&gt; &gt;Yes, but I think that most people here want to *experience* the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;uploaded.  In a destructive upload, our stream of consciousness would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cease to exist.  We would be dead and there would be a computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;program running that would swear it was us, and would in fact be us,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;albeit running on a separate stream of consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Just like a stream of consciousness ceases when I go to sleep</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a separate stream of consciousness is created when my body</i><br>
<i>&gt; wakes up? There will probably be something unique about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; discontinuity involved in uploading, but I have heard no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; to expect that the mind which uploading produces lacks anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the mind which will inhabit my body after a more familiar</i><br>
<i>&gt; discontinuity has.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I would not debate the quality of the new conciousness, however, I would<br>
beg to differ on the stream of conciousness of ME.  While the new<br>
improved uploaded me who thinks it is still me has the same continuity<br>
of conciousness as I, if I die, I'm dead, and he's somebody else and<br>
thats it.  However, I beleive that an individual who takes an extended<br>
period of time adding better, faster higher powered artificial<br>
augmentation to the existing mind would, once a certain threshold had<br>
been reached, have very little awareness of a difference of self if the<br>
original bioware suddenly crashed. <br>
<p>
I also suspect that any clones would also feel a distinct pretectiveness<br>
of self, something that is ingrained. (which brings up the question, is<br>
a clone as smart as the original?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;   I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;too many people would terminate their own stream of consciousness to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;create new independant ones.  What would be the advantage?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Greater wealth through the ability to work at faster clock speeds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; More security through the ability to make distributed backups.</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention greater sensory bandwidth and a lack of need to lug a<br>
heavy body around the world or solar system to take on a new project. I<br>
would surmise that the closest we can ever actually get to teleportation<br>
is to beam one's software template out to operate a cyborg at a distant<br>
location. Given transciever stations on different planets, and the fact<br>
that photons do not know what elapsed time is, we could have<br>
instantaneous interplanetary and interstellar travel by beaming our<br>
'wareness out to another planet, and loaded into an android or<br>
gengineered organism capable of being implanted. Scotty, you're a has<br>
been!<br>
<p>
just this is ample justification to get to work now on really pushing<br>
interstellar probes, to get recieving stations on site by the time we<br>
are ready to use them to farcast.<br>
