        Interesting point...and very valid.  Now that I think about it, a<br>
poem (I'm writing about what I know) that is written around casual analysis<br>
would probably be quite dry.  The secondary purpose of *my* poetry is to<br>
convey my thoughts to others in an attractive means...and it just so happens<br>
that I *can*.  If someone questions me about certain terms or ideas within a<br>
poem (of mine), I can then go into more description.  If I wrote a poem on<br>
the process of cryonics:<br>
<p>
        They put your body on to a slab\<br>
        And then into a ten-foot vat\<br>
        Fueled with nitrogen at absolute zero\<br>
        --A 320 degree thermostat.<br>
<p>
        it would be rather dry.  What I intend with my secondary purpose is<br>
to at least spark a notion into a reader's mind.  Introduce them to an idea.<br>
<i>&gt;From there, they can choose to pursue their need to understand the idea, or</i><br>
let it slide and praise it for what they do not understand.<br>
