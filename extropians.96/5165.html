From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Essentially, you have one station at geosynch, that is say a hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles long, containing a main EM rail system, and an</i><br>
<i>&gt; accelerator/decellerator rail in parallel. On the opposite side of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; planet, you've got a ground station, with a similar EM setup. </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; The cars would, when reaching the geosynch station, be traveling at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same velocity as the station, from which they can either dump their</i><br>
<i>&gt; load, accept a load, or be switched to the parallel system for</i><br>
<i>&gt; changeover to an accelerator for transition to higher orbit or</i><br>
<i>&gt; interplanetary trajectory.</i><br>
<p>
My orbital mechanics is pretty rusty, but I think the cars would<br>
actually have a significant velocity relative to the geosynch station<br>
(having climbed all the way up from Earth), and similarly would need a<br>
big kick on leaving the station so that they would drop out of geosync<br>
orbit all the way down to a perigee of 1 earth radius.  This is quite<br>
a big drop.  My very rough calculations came out with a value of about<br>
10,000 m/s for the velocity differential between the circular orbit and<br>
the elliptical one at apogee.  Maybe that is tolerable with your EM rail,<br>
if it is long enough.  A similar velocity differential exists at the<br>
Earth side as well.  (Obviously you need greater than LEO speed there,<br>
which is about 7000 m/s.)<br>
