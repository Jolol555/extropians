The first is learning how to switch from one thing to another almost <br>
instantly.  <br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
&lt;much good stuff snipped&gt;<br>
Minimizing the context-switching cost is crucial to the success of <br>
this strategy.<br>
<p>
 I'll add one observation if I may: the [desire to do] <br>
best is the enemy of the [desire to do] good, or it can be. In order <br>
to minimize the stumbling blocks when I switch contexts, I have <br>
cultivated a different way of seeing the world than the one I grew up <br>
with, which tends to be too perfectionistic and quick to feel <br>
thwarted. It seems more like cultivation than technique.<br>
<p>
And of course, a description is not always a roadmap. I've been <br>
there, but I don't know how to tell someone else how to get there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
  My training is basically to be more sensitive to what I feel most <br>
like doing and to evaluate that course of action rationally and see if I still <br>
feel like doing it, and if I do feel most like doing something, then I will do <br>
it.<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
10-4 on that. For myself, I let the evaluation stay nonverbal, mostly--<br>
but it still is _conscious_ (or perhaps _purposive_); I don't catch <br>
myself being conflicted about it.<br>
<p>
Do you notice, when that's working, that you can stay up for loooong <br>
periods of time, without feeling either particularly fatigued or <br>
particularly "wired"? I do, and it's grand--there just happens to be <br>
something I'd rather be doing than sleep, moment to moment to moment.<br>
<p>
And, contrary to some predictions, my ability to relate to other <br>
people goes *up*, not down. They're only as much "interruption" as I <br>
make them. When the context switching cost is minimized, it's almost <br>
impossible to stay rattled or put off by interruptions--there's no <br>
blocking (recovery) time to speak of.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
 It basically involves maintaining a <br>
mental plan of one's course of action, clear enough that it can be followed <br>
without hesitation.<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
For me, it also involves practice at handling plan-vs-reality <br>
mismatches in a fluid way. I think it's kind of like applied <br>
beginner's mind, if that's not a contradiction in terms... :)<br>
