Greg Burch brought up the question of how we go from our current situation to <br>
one that is more like the libertarian / anarcho-capitalist world that most of <br>
us here would prefer.  I agree that it will have to be an incremental <br>
approach, where each step has clear benefits over the previous stages, where <br>
liberty pays better than tyranny.  <br>
<p>
I am the State Secretary for the Libertarian Party of Utah, and I recently <br>
wrote an article for our current monthly newsletter, The Utah Liberator, which <br>
presents one solution which I think is likely to happen.  Here is the article <br>
I wrote:<br>
<p>
MOMM is Better than Uncle Sam<br>
<p>
	As Libertarians, we want our government to be limited to only those functions <br>
authorized in the Constitution.  Our biggest problem is the huge numbers of <br>
people who want government to do everything for them, to provide education, <br>
health-care, to make sure the drugs and other products they buy are all tested <br>
and proven safe and so forth.  There are a huge number of people who want to <br>
be taken care of, who want someone to look out for them.  This, in itself, is <br>
okay.  We only have a problem with it when the government tries to do that <br>
job, because that means that those who don't want or need those services have <br>
to pay for them anyway, and most of the money is wasted along the way by the <br>
horrible inefficiency of government programs.<br>
	So, something that would go a long way towards getting government out of our <br>
lives and our wallets would be the formation of some companies which provided <br>
for people all of the services which government tries to provide, but does it <br>
cheaper and better than the government does.  Libertarians have been talking <br>
about privatizing for years now, and there already exist private companies <br>
which perform basically the same services that government attempts to do.  <br>
There are private schools, private drug testing companies, Consumer Reports <br>
and so forth.  But people still want the government to provide these services. <br>
 Why?<br>
	Most of the reason is probably because people are simply used to the <br>
government doing that job and don't want to change, but I think that another <br>
important reason is because all of these private companies are separate <br>
companies, each doing only their specialty.  What we need is several companies <br>
which could each provide ALL the services the government provides, and perhaps <br>
much more.  Now, these wouldn't have to be huge, monolithic companies because <br>
they could simply contract out to various smaller companies which specialize <br>
in one particular area.  They would simply provide a way of bringing these <br>
companies together in various ways to serve the wishes of their clients.  If <br>
their client wants education or job training, the company would help them get <br>
into a good school.  If they need medical services, the company will register <br>
them with a hospital which they have used another company to evaluate, and <br>
they will only be administered drugs which have been independently evaluated <br>
by a reputable drug testing company and are deemed safe enough to meet the <br>
client's desired level of safety.<br>
	The companies basically would manage the affairs of their client's life, to <br>
whatever degree their client wanted them to.  They would basically be a <br>
middle-man between the client and a huge number of other companies which <br>
provide the services which their clients desire.  I like to call these types <br>
of companies MOMM (Management and Organization for the Mindless Masses).  And <br>
a MOMM would take good care of its clients.<br>
	But what about poor people and people on welfare?  How can they afford the <br>
services of a MOMM company?  Most poor people are poor because they lack the <br>
education and skills necessary to do highly productive work.  An agent from a <br>
MOMM company could approach a poor person and offer to provide them with good, <br>
marketable skills, housing for them and their family, food, security, <br>
health-care and so forth, if the poor person contracted with the MOMM company <br>
to pay the MOMM company a certain percentage of their future income.  MOMM is <br>
simply making an investment in a human being, and then it will proceed to <br>
train that human to be highly productive, because the more the person earns, <br>
the more the MOMM company gets.  Thus MOMM has a big interest in the welfare <br>
of its clients, and MOMM will take good care of them.  They will be trained <br>
well, and MOMM will see to it that they get a good job, and if they ever <br>
deserve a raise, MOMM will see to it that they get it, because then MOMM will <br>
get a raise too.<br>
	If several MOMM companies are formed, and if they are successful, I predict <br>
that the demand for government to provide all the services it tries to will <br>
decrease.  People simply won't need Uncle Sam to take care of them, because <br>
they'll have MOMM.  And the best thing is that no one will force you to be a <br>
client of a MOMM company or subscribe to any services you don't want.  That's <br>
something we don't get with Uncle Sam.<br>
