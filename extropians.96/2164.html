In _Mind Children_ (one of the appendixes, I think), Hans Moravec<br>
provides a model of the universe as a spherical gas bubble where time<br>
runs more slowly toward the center, due to increased mass and gravity,<br>
while interactions speed up towards the periphery due to higher<br>
frequencies.<br>
<p>
Moravec suspects that we live in the (Slow-Zone?) 'V world', where<br>
volume or space dominates our activities, but there may be more advanced<br>
entities dwelling in the 'F world' transform (Transcend?) of our<br>
universe where frequency dominates:<br>
<p>
&lt;As our universe gradually expands, the wavelengths of the background<br>
radiation increase. As the wavelengths get longer and longer, the<br>
relative rate of time flow in the F world slows down. Any inhabitants of<br>
F would be ideally situated to practice the 'live forever by going<br>
slower and slower as it gets colder and colder' strategy proposed by<br>
Freeman Dyson ["Infinite in All Directions", 1988] ... In the past,<br>
shortly after the big bang, when the universe was dense and hot, the F<br>
world would have been a lively place .... The first microsecond of the<br>
big bang could represent eons of subjective time in F. Perhaps enough<br>
time for intelligence to evolve, realize its situation, and seed smaller<br>
but eventually faster life in the V space.&gt;<br>
<p>
Also of possible interest for this thread, is Rudy Rucker's 7/95 _Wired_<br>
(that's the one with the egghead picture of Richard Dawkins on the<br>
cover) interview with Russian physicist Andrei Linde, now at Stanford,<br>
who is involved in simulations of a fractal, self-replicating,<br>
inflationary universe as opposed to the more orthodox Big-Bang<br>
scenarios.<br>
<p>
Linde talks about scalar and vector fields and how the Higgs field<br>
creates "domain walls" within our universe such that there could be<br>
slightly different instantiations of the laws of physics within each<br>
domain.  While Linde thinks it is possible to create "baby universes",<br>
he believes that the only way we could move into them would be by<br>
encoding ourselves into their physical laws and then letting them evolve<br>
independently.  He says there is no way to pass between universes or<br>
communicate with other universes except by creating them and encoding a<br>
message in their physical laws. He suggests that "our universe was<br>
created not by God, but by a physicist-hacker".<br>
