IAN: Yes, but James's reply speaks on how the isotrophy is broken. <br>
<p>
Yet even if there is a variation in the force of impulse from vertical<br>
to horizontal, there should be symmetrical distribution of impulse force<br>
that falls off in direct relation to distance from blast epicenter on a<br>
horizontal plane. But the damage to the building is not only too deep <br>
but is also asymmetrical relative to the epicenter.<br>
<p>
The best "one-bomb one-bomber one-helper" conspiracy theory I've heard <br>
is that the truck and its arrangement of bombs was designed such that <br>
many yet to explode barrel-bombs would shoot into the building and<br>
then explode, causing maximum internal damage and possibly an <br>
symmetrical damage pattern. Apparently this was a technique McVeigh <br>
could have learned in his military training. I would like to hear <br>
Partin's reply to this case for the "magic bomb" conspiracy theory.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;The analysis is correct for free standing columns, since the only bending </i><br>

<i>&gt;However in a building, the connection to the floors provides bending fulcrums </i><br>
<i>&gt;which allow part of the concrete to be put in tension, causing the concrete to </i><br>
<i>&gt;break since it has little tensile strength. The connections to outside concrete</i><br>
<i>&gt;walls provide broad surfaces for the blast pressure to act over that couple </i><br>
<i>&gt;fairly well to the columns. The reinforcing iron is started bending as well, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and having lost the compression bearing structure of the concrete, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;buckles under the weight of the upper floors. The explosive doesn't have to </i><br>
<i>&gt;have the impulse to sever the beams, it undermines them and the weight of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;upper floors does the rest. During the falling of a building, some of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;re-bars will be placed under tremendous tension, and sheared along their</i><br>
width. <br>
<i>&gt;That damage looks superficially similiar to the tearing produced by a nearby </i><br>
<i>&gt;charge of high explosive along one side of the beam.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: But this still requires that the blast exerts enough pressure to <br>
undermine. According to Partin the physics dictate that, from blast epicenter <br>
to column B3 ( the furthest in column taken out ), B3 should only experience <br>
about 25 pounds of pressure psi. The thin decorative veneer covering over <br>
columns B2 and B4 was not even blown off. I don't know, but Partin's <br>
analysis in total appears compelling, then consider so much else.<br>
<p>
Also, as James pointed out, the bomb in Saudi Arabia was larger. In fact, <br>
the crater was 4X deeper and 3X wider than the OK bomb (a). The crater <br>
is also closer to the building. The military grade explosive ' hexolite '<br>
was used (b), which packs a far greater force of impulse than Ammonium <br>
nitrate. Then witness that this much larger blast only takes the face <br>
off a smaller building with no reinforced, or even unrenforced, columns. <br>
<p>
The Saudi apartment building, not built to withstand a bomb, unlike the <br>
Murrah building, was a house of cards. Yet a blast 3X larger with much <br>
stronger impulse than the OK bomb does a fraction of the damage seen<br>
in Oklahoma City. I don't know, but it seems curious.<br>

<i> &gt; I can't rule out what Partin is saying, but I'm offering a known</i><br>
<i> &gt; damage mechanism that could reasonably produce a similiar effect</i><br>
<i> &gt; without needing to invoke conspiracies.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
IAN: I think we can agree that the facts could be interpritted <br>
to support these two conspiracy theories:<br>
<p>
        (1) Only McVeigh and Nicholes dit it.<br>
        (2) McVeigh, Nicholes and others did it.<br>
<p>
Therefore we cannot prefer one over the other due to its not being <br>
a conspiracy theory, as both are. Every interpritation of fact will <br>
support a given conspiracy theory. I think to many facts conflict <br>
with conspiracy (1), and (2) looks far more consistent with fact. <br>
Who those others are, I don't know.<br>
