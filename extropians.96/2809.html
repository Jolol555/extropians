        I could almost wipe a tear from my eye if I didn't already know <br>
this myself.  This is one of (if not *the*) most uplifting posts I have <br>
seen in my months on this list.  It takes the vast majority of humankind <br>
many years to figure this out.  Most people *never* figure this out.  The<br>
sad part (let me lament a little here) is that it is such a simple meme.<br>
People should grow up with this knowledge...know it instinctively.  We <br>
create ourselves.  We *create*.  We are all artists.  We are all art.  We<br>
*are*.  It is so tremendously important for the future of mankind; to <br>
attain progress, we must create.  Gandhi had a phrase (also someone's<br>
signature, and a line in one of my poems) that said "You must be the<br>
change you wish to see in the world."  As everyone on this list should<br>
know, those words are ultimately true.  *We* know that, now the next step<br>
is to show that to others.  Again, kudos to David for an excellent post!<br>
