      EXpedition 97<br>
<p>
Some of us have been talking about the need for more frequent and varied<br>
opportunities for extropians to get together in person.  Toward that end, I'm<br>
seriously considering an "extropian" backpacking trip over the July 4 holiday<br>
in 1997.  I have a specific trip in mind:<br>
<p>
	Dates: 3-7 July, 1997<br>
	Place: Pecos Wilderness, near Santa Fe, New Mexico<br>
<p>
I choose this because (1) rendezvous at the Albuquerque airport would be<br>
roughly equally convenient/inconvenient for folks in many regions of the<br>
country, (2) for the Left and Right Coasters, this area might present a<br>
chance to see some back country with which you're not familiar and (3) I know<br>
the area pretty well.<br>
<p>
I am *not* married to this specific trip, and would be more than open to<br>
suggestions for alternative places.  I personally probably don't have much<br>
flexibility on dates, i.e. while I might be able to shift things a day or so<br>
one way or the other, other obvious holiday weekends are already pretty much<br>
committed for me in ‘97.<br>
<p>
The trip I have in mind would be a relatively easy one, with no more than six<br>
to eight miles per full-pack day and the possibilities of some lightly-loaded<br>
day hikes from a selection of good base camp sites, including the possibility<br>
of a peak-bagging run.  Weather conditions should be quite mild, so we<br>
wouldn't need a lot of heavy gear.  On the downside, this area is very close<br>
to Santa Fe and will probably have a relatively large human population over<br>
the 4 July holiday.  While I prefer more remote areas, those expeditions<br>
require a full week of time.<br>
<p>
Also, because my schedule is sometimes unavoidably interrupted due to work,<br>
I'll be looking for an alternate "guide" in case some curmudgeon judge sets<br>
me for trial on short notice -- any volunteers?  (This trip is so<br>
non-technical and the route is so easy that no previous familiarity with the<br>
trail system would be required: All you'd have to be able to do is read a<br>
map.)<br>
<p>
Max and Natasha have already expressed strong interest in this trip and are<br>
probable EXpedition members.  Novices will be more than welcome and I'll be<br>
happy to do a little pre-trip "coaching" on training and gear.  You do *not*<br>
need to be in top condition for this trip; only reasonably fit.  In fact, if<br>
you've been considering a push on your fitness program, shooting for the trip<br>
will be a good and achievable goal.<br>
<p>
I have created a web page for this trip:<br>
<p>

<p>
If you've never been backpacking before and/or are even remotely interested<br>
in this trip, stop by my backpacking page:<br>

<p>
(Don't be put off by the title of my page -- it's an inside joke that grew<br>
out of a *much* tougher trip than the one I'm planning.)<br>
<p>
If you're interested in the trip, please send me an e-mail.  PLEASE put the<br>
term "EXP97" at the beginning of the subject line.  As the group for this<br>
trip firms up, I'll circulate private e-mail to the individuals who sign up<br>
or just want to stay up to date for the possibility of going.  I'd like to<br>
shoot for firm commitments by late March or early April so I can engage in<br>
technical and logistics planning.<br>
<p>
Hope to see you on "Expedition 97"!<br>
