The distinction is often made with a slightly different terminology:<br>
Intrinsic vs. instrumental. An intrinsic goal is one valued for itself,<br>
while an instrumental goal is one you value because it will help you get<br>
something else that you want intrinsically. Of course, something could be<br>
valued both intrinsically and instrumentally: I intrinsically value hiking<br>
up a mountain, and I also value it instrumentally for the beneficial effects<br>
on my muscular and cardiovascular systems.<br>
<p>
Ayn Rand distinguished intrinsic, subjective and objective values. Intrinsic<br>
values, in the sense she used it, were values that you had to hold even if<br>
they were of no personal significance. If service to others is an intrinsic<br>
value, you ought to do it even if you don't want to and even if it's bad for<br>
you. Rand (correctly I think) denied the existence of intrinsic values in<br>
this sense.<br>
<p>
The subjective/objective distinction will be obvious, at least in outline.<br>
I've come to prefer to talk of "rational values" rather than objective<br>
values. Perhaps I can explain this when I reply to Tim's question about how<br>
to get from "is" to "ought".<br>
