I don't understand why that's important. There might be a huge number of <br>
"phony" John Clarks running around with vivid memories of things that never <br>
happened, but I don't care as long as I'm there too.<br>

<p>
As long as the Omega Point could perform an infinite number of computations <br>
and not just an astronomically large number (two very different concepts), <br>
I don't see why it couldn't emulate you and all your experiences. Even finite <br>
brute force can accomplish a lot if you give it enough time, it did after all<br>
produce life. If the brute force process has access to a computer that can  <br>
perform an infinite number of computations then coming up with you and me,  <br>
and every conceivable variation of you and me, would be trivially easy for it <br>
to do.                    <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;Markov chains because state Xi+1 is  NOT dependent ONLY on                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the state the system is in at state Xi. Random inputs from                 </i><br>

<i>                &gt;cause the next state to be quite discontinuous from state Xi. </i><br>
                          <br>
<p>
Why isn't that a Markov chain? Any knowledge other than knowledge of a <br>
system's present state will not help you make a better prediction on what <br>
state the system will be in next, and that's a Markov chain. The system's <br>
history, how it got to its present state, is not important. Yes you can have <br>
random inputs, but that's just another way of saying not every effect has a <br>
cause and Markov chains can certainly handle that. Except for the trivial <br>
case where all probabilities are equal to one, Markov chains are not <br>
deterministic but stochastic.<br>
                          <br>

<i>                &gt;We are not Markov chains because we have memory</i><br>
                          <br>
<p>
If I have a memory then the present physical state of my brain is different <br>
than it would be if I did not have that memory and it could be important in <br>
determining the probability of what physical state it will be in next, <br>
in other words what my next thought will be. If I once had a memory but now <br>
have totally forgotten it, both consciously and unconsciously, then that<br>
information will not help you figure out what I will do next, you can only <br>
look at my present state and then play the odds.    <br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;AND we can plan ahead.</i><br>
                           <br>
<p>
We can invent theories about what the most probable future will be, but there  <br>
is no reason a Markov chain can't do that.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Even if A SINGLE entity can be IN only a finite number of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;states, this does not mean that there are ONLY a finite                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;number of TOTAL states that an entity can choose from.</i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
If I can only be in N states then whatever state I'm going to be in next it <br>
must be one of those N states. A 10 bit computer memory chip can be in 2^10  <br>
sates, regardless of what happens when all is said and done, that chip will  <br>
always be in one of those 2^10 states. I think using a word like "choose" <br>
just muddies the waters.<br>
