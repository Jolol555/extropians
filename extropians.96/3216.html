xxAlso has anyone ever thought of putting together an<br>
organization that would show up at trekkie conventions and create a fund to<br>
pump into R&amp;D for space travel?<br>
<p>
Hey! ...not a bad idea.  kind of like the cryogenics people going to the sci<br>
fi cons. When I went to that it didnt seem like they had much success at it.<br>
Do think it would work? ready to put in the hours? <br>
How much is one of thoese booths? What would you sell, or would you just ask<br>
for free money?<br>
you could sell Extropy, take donations,  and if you also some kind of widget<br>
you could maybe make a profit too...<br>
