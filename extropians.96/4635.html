Apart from the possible difficulty of making a kilobit quantum computer,<br>
I hadn't heard that they would be useful for cracking symmetric ciphers.<br>
They could factor numbers happily, thus bye-bye RSA and Blum-Blum-Shup;<br>
can they do tons of IDEA or RC4 attempts as well?<br>
<p>
James Roger wrote that RC4 is very simple.  I know; that's why it's even<br>
weirder.  I was told it was: very short and simple (I've seen the code),<br>
not robust (switch two lines and it becomes simple to break; as with<br>
DES, an argument that there is no back door), and possessed of an impure<br>
spectrum, which nonetheless none of the cypherpunks had been able to<br>
exploit, at least usefully.  I believe this qualifies as weird.<br>
<p>
Actually, I think Hal's name was mentioned in connection with the<br>
analysis of the thing.  Are any of my facts wrong?<br>
