<i>&gt;I think this type of growth curve can be applied to increases in population </i><br>
<i>&gt;or wealth. Most of what I would consider credible estimates of future world </i><br>
<i>&gt;population predict a stabilization somewhere in the 10 to 15 billion range. </i><br>
<i>&gt;This would make a curve like the one mentioned. I can also see more similar </i><br>
<i>&gt;shaped curves taking off from the previous one with the colonization of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;rest of the solar system, neighboring systems, etc.</i><br>
     <br>
     The dynamic optimist in me believes that it will be possible to <br>
     achieve an ever-increasing human population living at higher and <br>
     higher aggregate living standards.  The 10 to 15 billion range could <br>
     easily become a self-fulfilling meme. <br>
