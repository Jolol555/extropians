In a message dated 96-11-24 02:58:55 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; But what does it mean "the amount is less than a banana" ? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
We will have to let them tell us what they mean.  The amount probably be will<br>
be measured in Methanol concentration by weight or by volume the same as it<br>
is measured in other foods and beverages.  I like by weight better, w/w.  It<br>
could also be measured in milligrams percent,  milligrams per 100 grams or<br>
parts per million.  <br>
   <br>
&lt;&lt; What amount ? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The Methanol from a NutraSweet sweetened product could be compared to the<br>
amount derived from a banana based on percent w/w concentration.  I think<br>
bananas have less than 1 percent w/w total alcohols and much less than that<br>
is methanol, but I don't know exactly how much less.  The journal _Food<br>
Technology_ (I think) had an article I read on this some years ago.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Most nutra-sweet containing beverages have<br>
 it listed as the second or third ingredient. As I've read,<br>
 it's 10% methanol. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
You can't go by that.  That would be the raw Asparatame material and not the<br>
concentration in the beverage.  From my work in the food industry less than<br>
one gram of NutraSweet is dissolved per 355 grams of soda, so &lt;1gram per 356<br>
total grams x 100 is &lt;0.28 percent NutraSweet w/w.  Then, 10% (I assume you<br>
are sure of this, I didn't check) of &lt;0.28 percent is concentration of<br>
 &lt;0.028 percent w/w Methanol (actually a breakdown product (not "in")<br>
NutraSweet).<br>
<p>
Now,  what does a banana have?  Greater to? or equal to? or less than &lt;0.028<br>
percent methanol concentration?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;This seems pretty high over all, espe-<br>
 cially if you consider some people drink 6 cans a day. <br>
 I suspect the consumption of nutra-sweet exceeds <br>
 on average the consumption of bananas. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Very true, for some.  (I can't stand NS myself). Lets take the &lt;0.028 % w/w<br>
methanol times six (6 cans, Oh, yuck!)  is  0.17 percent w/w methanol.  So,<br>
we could compare 0.17% w/w Methanol in 6 sodas sweetened with NutraSweet to<br>
the percent w/w concentration of Methanol in a banana.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; And anyways, just because bananas may contain an <br>
 agent that is harmful does not mean that that agent<br>
 is no longer harmful simply because we think of <br>
 bananas as healthy. &gt;&gt;  <br>
<p>
True, but it would go a very long way to _suggest_ epidemiologically the<br>
methanol concentration IS safe.  I don't know of any metabolic pathway that<br>
shows a lower concentration of Methanol will cause more problems than a<br>
higher concentration.  Of course, methanol is toxic in a high enough<br>
concentration.  The question is not methanol, per se,  the question is the<br>
concentration and the metabolic pathways.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Pretty simple logic. It<br>
 could be that bananas have so much good<br>
 stuff--they do--it counters the bad.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Ha Ha.  Now, I know your just kidding around ;-)  <br>
<p>
Good post.<br>
