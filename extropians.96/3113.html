This is my way cool signature message!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the short term, intelligent machines will be a great benefit to</i><br>
humans, <br>
<i>&gt; especially to intelligent humans who know how to use them.  There will be</i><br>
no <br>
<i>&gt; reasonable way to see these machines as a threat to humanity in any</i><br>
immediate <br>
<i>&gt; sense.  </i><br>
<p>
Agreed<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To them, the typical human will seem far more </i><br>
<i>&gt; entropic than mass murdering psychopaths seem to us.  We are terribly </i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficient and wasteful of energy and matter, in terms of the amount of </i><br>
<i>&gt; cognition and intelligence that our bodily and mental sytems produce with</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; regards to how much matter and energy it requires to maintain the systems</i><br>
we <br>
<i>&gt; are (in comparison to projected future beings</i><br>
<p>
No i don't buy that one. We don't use energy per se. we live of the<br>
difference between the energy radiated to earth and the heath being spilled<br>
into space. If these robots live in space there will be a lot more energy<br>
from the sun to use, than the puny amounts of fossils and radioactives that<br>
we are using.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another thing these systems are likely to do is turn off the sun, if</i><br>
possible. <br>
<i>&gt;  The sun wastes far more energy than us puny humans, so they will</i><br>
probably <br>
<i>&gt; destroy that horribly wasteful fusion reaction first, if possible</i><br>
<p>
well that might be a reasonable argument.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Eventually, humans will interfere quite a lot with the goals of these </i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent beings, who will think no more of destroying humans than we</i><br>
do of <br>
<i>&gt; brushing our teeth or washing our hands, killing millions of bacteria.</i><br>
<i>&gt; - David Musick</i><br>
<p>
The weakest point i can see in your argument is that you see these highly<br>
developed creatures as one networked *character*. But why shouldn't they<br>
develop different races with different goals. Robots that are good for<br>
mining hydrogen from Jupiter won't be shaped the same as robots making<br>
solar energy on the moon.<br>
<p>
Even if these robots would have a tendency to coorporate against the the<br>
humans, the speed of light could put an end to that. The robots would be<br>
spread out over the entire solar system or more. It will take hours or days<br>
for any signal traveling between the robots. They would probably comunicate<br>
thru something akin to cellular phone systems. Or else there will be to<br>
many robots and to little bandwith. This would make any signal take even<br>
longer to reach every bot.<br>
Even a simple hard/soft-ware error could isolate colonies of robots.<br>
If you put that in the context of what new development would take place and<br>
at what speed in the singularity, robots would soon have evolved<br>
differently in different habitats. Just imagine the difference between<br>
robots close to the sun and robots far away. There's a lot of different<br>
habitats even in space.<br>
Computer simulations runing at speeds orders of magnitudes faster than<br>
realtime would make new design advance several generations before commiting<br>
to hardware.<br>
I simply don't believe that it is possible for any robots to be a<br>
homogenous mass. Some would want to put out the sun, but others might need<br>
it.<br>
<p>
They would probably fight between themself. Well they might even stop to<br>
worrying about us. Like when to human nations fight and are to busy doing<br>
that to kill of other *inferior* lifeforms.<br>
