My two cents: there are different kinds of property. I disagree with pretty<br>
much everything that Suresh says, but have some reservations about ownership<br>
of land.<br>
<p>
If A kills B, takes his land, and sells it to C, does C have a right to<br>
the property? (multiply sells it to C as much as you like). What if B<br>
doesn't have a concept of property, and doesn't think of himself as <br>
"owning" the land, but perhaps more as a caretaker of the land.<br>
<p>
Doesn't most real estate property derive (at some point in the past) from<br>
a coercive takeover of the land? If the King of France bequeaths to some<br>
nobleman some land (which the King obtained &amp; maintained by coercion), does<br>
the nobleman's descendents hundreds of years down the line have a real<br>
right to the property? I asked this a couple of years ago, but never got<br>
what I considered a satisfactory response.<br>
<p>
I'm talking theory here, not practice. Land ownership may be beneficial<br>
in many ways, but doesn't all land ownership derive from past coercion?<br>
How is this reconciled with the NCP?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
