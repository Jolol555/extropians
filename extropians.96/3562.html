Point mutations are very common, all of us have several in our genome,  <br>
sometimes they're harmless, usually they're harmful, occasionally they're <br>
disastrous, very rarely they are helpful. I disagree that nature must have  <br>
already found all the good ideas, it never found the wheel for large animals,  <br>
but I concede that it's very unlikely that one simple point mutation could  <br>
dramatically increase intelligence with no downside. On the other hand, this  <br>
argument breaks down completely if you talk about 2 separate point mutations.<br>
<p>
If the tire on you car is going bad you can take it off and put on a new one. <br>
Evolution is far too stupid to understand this simple act because it has  <br>
absolutely no foresight. When you take the bad tire off you have temporally <br>
made things worse, now you have no tire at all. Evolution doesn't understand  <br>
one step backwards 2 steps forward, every mutation must benefit the animal <br>
NOW, or it will not be passed on to the next generation. If the first <br>
mutation needed to make a genius was even slightly harmful it would not <br>
spread in the population. Even if the first mutation was neutral the second <br>
mutation would have to come along mighty quickly or genetic drift would soon <br>
eliminate the first. Also, it's clear that a small change in the genome can <br>
cause a big improvement, its a lot more than a point mutation but the fact  <br>
that only about 1% of the genome of a human is different from that of a chimp <br>
gives some support to my view.<br>
<p>
An even stronger case can be made for longevity, just one point mutation <br>
could work wonders. A mutation that put the bodie's cell repair mechanism <br>
into high gear so that it would never get grow old and feeble would probably <br>
not be passed on. In the first place it doesn't matter how much the individual <br>
likes his mutation. The unit of natural selection is the gene not the<br>
individual. An enormously successful  strategy genes have found to reproduce <br>
themselves is to make individuals that live for only a short time but breed <br>
very rapidly, just look at the insects. In  the second place such a mutation <br>
might not even be good for the individual. In the wild few animals die of old <br>
age, something eats them first. Good maintenance takes energy, if the <br>
mutation increased the energy  requirements of an animal by 10% it might <br>
actually decrease its life span and die from starvation before it could <br>
reproduce.<br>
