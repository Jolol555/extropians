<p>
According to the physics book I read last, the experiments that looked <br>
for proton decay didn't find any, so the halflife is longer than 10^31 <br>
years as predicted by SU(5) (which hence is falsified). So in Tipler's <br>
scenario we will still enjoy protons up to the final moments.<br>
<p>
I have been working a bit on the Dyson scenario (slow, cold life in an open<br>
universe), and there we have to deal with baryonic decay (if matter is stable<br>
it will still decay to black holes sooner or later, which then evaporate into<br>
leptons). Does anybody have a serious idea of how to implement life in a<br>
substrate of electrons, positrons, photons and neutrinos? Billiard ball<br>
computers? <br>
<p>
I have looked at the energy costs of reversible life, and so far it looks<br>
good: the integral of the energy demands of error correction stays finite as<br>
t-&gt;inf. The trouble is redshifting of message photons and the energy costs of<br>
making more memory. I'll get back to that... <br>
<p>
Another thing I would like to hear opinions on: can a part of spacetime <br>
be collapsed into something like a closed universe (i.e. not a black hole <br>
singularity)? <br>
