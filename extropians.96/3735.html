<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Now we have come to an issue which I think is important in the here and</i><br>
<i>&gt;now, and about which I seem to have serious differences in viewpoint from most</i><br>
<i>&gt;others. I would like to see what others think of my idea. I do not think that</i><br>
<i>&gt;privacy is "evil", but simply that it is counterproductive to communications</i><br>
<i>&gt;and to mutual understanding in human relations. In addition, in my view a</i><br>
<i>&gt;person who has high self esteemm, ie. is proud of all his/her thoughts and</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions should have no need for any privacy and, in fact, should be completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;happy to have these things all open to the public.</i><br>
<p>
I think there may be a confusion on exactly what level we<br>
are discussing "privacy" on.  I understand what you're saying,<br>
that people who are intensely private are missing out on a lot, but<br>
really what you're talking about is privacy as a personality trait. What is<br>
a more basic concern to myself as a libertarian is the RIGHT to privacy. How<br>
open can you be to anyone individual when anyone and everyone could hear<br>
what you're saying?  What I consider counterproductive is people who demand<br>
of you at every turn "What are doing? What are you working on? Why are you<br>
wasting time with that?  <br>
You can be proud as you want of what you're thinking, but if you're in a<br>
situation where there are people who will attack, verbally abuse, or even<br>
lock you up for saying it, you had better<br>
be able to practice some disgression about who is hearing<br>
you and who isn't. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     In our present society, where scarciety rules and it is necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt;retain privacy of ideas which might produce wealth for oneself, it seems that</i><br>
<i>&gt;some kind of privacy is necessary. For an alternative to this which I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;is portrayed very convincingly (and which I just loved when I read it) I</i><br>
<i>&gt;recommend readers to James P. Hogan's "Voyage from Yesteryear"</i><br>
<p>
I too have read an thoroughly enjoyed "Voyage from Yesteryear"; I believe it<br>
won a Prometheus award and would support its addition to any extropian<br>
mailing list (Actually I think it is listed<br>
at the end of the Extropian Principles 2.6).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     In all my dealings with others, I try to be as open and revealing of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;inner most thoughts as possible. I reject totally the idea that "white lies"</i><br>
<i>&gt;are OK. Furthermore, I have stated many times that my desire to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communuicate with fidelity what I am is so great (and I seem not be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish this by standard interpersonal methods), that I would very much</i><br>
<i>&gt;welcome a human augmentation which would allow us all to transmit and receive</i><br>
<i>&gt;each others thoughts. I have stated that if such an augmentation were possible,</i><br>
<p>
I too would love to augment my consciousness to the point of direct<br>
transmission of "thoughts", but at the same time I would be reluctant to<br>
ever use that augmentation knowing that my thoughts could be read by ANYONE,<br>
i.e. the State, the nextdoor neighbor, etc..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally better</i><br>
<i>&gt;world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever they</i><br>
<i>&gt;liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<p>
I have serious reservations about this sentiment.  The problems<br>
of violence don't come from lack of adequate means of  communication, but<br>
rather the refusal to communicate on a meaningful, productive level,<br>
invariably stemming from  an initial refusal to think at all.<br>
  All the ESP type powers given to people not inclined to some modicum of<br>
rational thought and respect for other individuals will not a utopia make.<br>
Sorry, but its a classic case of putting the carriage before the horse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My basic point here is to question the rationality of anyone valuing privacy.</i><br>
<p>
Privacy in some situations is detrimental, in others necessary. <br>
For any given statement you can make, there will be people out there who<br>
don't care what you say, be annoyed at what you say, be annoyed just because<br>
you're saying something, be violently annoyed at what you say,  misinterpret<br>
what you say, twist what you say, violently misinterpret what you say,<br>
decide to use what<br>
you say against you...the list goes on.<br>
<p>
As for people who desire privacy having something to hide, aside<br>
from the fact that the same argument has been used to justify <br>
one dictatorial regime after another throughout history, the<br>
reality behind most people's desire for privacy is not for conspiring<br>
against third parties (committing a crime) but to keep third parties from<br>
harming, misrepresenting or interfering with them (read: survival in a world<br>
where the State is recognized as legitimate)<br>
