That's the possibility that occurred to me after reading your citation of<br>
Nicholas. Certainly Churchland's theory of neurocomputational prototypes<br>
and his related theory of semantics would indicate that most of the<br>
semantic machinery of concepts-in-general (not necessarily our<br>
memetically-evolved modern human concepts) is already in place in the<br>
brains of most higher mammals, and that the special trick that human beings<br>
developed was using these fuzzy cognitive maps (if that's what they turn<br>
out to be like) to generate sequences of sounds that would stimulate and<br>
change the fuzzy cognitive maps in the brains of other human beings. In<br>
other words, language. But the underlying semantic/conceptual machinery of<br>
thought is probably there already in most biggish-brained mammals (and<br>
birds? who knows?). I'm out past the edge of my expertise here, but what<br>
the heck.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;One thing about birds is that they have wings, and so most of them have</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;million more years even if their brains have the same neurostructural basis</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;necessary for the ultimate development of language use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 [Robin]<br>
<i>&gt;The question is: had there not been mammals around when the dinos were</i><br>
<i>&gt;wiped out, could the birds have radiated to fill the gap, and followed</i><br>
<i>&gt;a similar trajectory to our position within a hundred million years?</i><br>
<i>&gt;If yes, this is not a hard step.</i><br>
<p>
If yes, then the hard step (following the usual assumption that there's<br>
only one really hard step in the Great Filter) happened in the development<br>
of some common ancestor of birds and mammals. And now that I think about<br>
how far back that common ancestor is, I'm inclined to think that birds<br>
could not have done the trick, wings, hands, or otherwise. If I thought the<br>
step were that far back, I'd probably prefer my earlier suggestion that the<br>
hard step was the evolution of eukaryotic endosymbiosis... and protist<br>
phylogeny (because it all happened in the past and the fossils are so tiny<br>
and the genes are so full of junk) is about as poorly understood as<br>
mammalian and avian brains are.<br>
<p>
I'm starting to feel like the opposite of the drunk who was looking for his<br>
lost wallet under the streetlamp on the corner because "That's where the<br>
light is best." We're looking for the Great Filter in our past, because we<br>
don't like the idea that it might lie in our future, and it seems that I<br>
keep wanting to locate it in the places where the light is poorest, to<br>
account for the fact that I can't find it. Ominous.<br>
<p>
Damn this Fermi Paradox anyhow, he said peevishly.<br>
