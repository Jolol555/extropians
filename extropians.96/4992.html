This is effectively impossible.  The total caloric requirements of a human<br>
being far exceed the quantity that can be stored in a single pill.  The<br>
caloric density will never be achieved, at least not without radically<br>
rewiring the human metabolism.  And this excludes certain materials the body<br>
needs in quantity outside its basic caloric requirements.<br>
<p>
Unless you feel like popping handfuls of pills, I see this as a totally<br>
impractical solution.<br>
