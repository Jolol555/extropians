Chris Hind related a story about saving the life of someone with respitory <br>
problems, caused by his genetics.  Now he's worried that he's "cheated <br>
evolution" by allowing "bad" genes to survive and possibly propogate, if the <br>
person he saved has any children.<br>
<p>
First of all, whether genes are "good" or "bad" depends entirely on the <br>
environment they're in.  A long time ago, that kid would have had pretty bad <br>
genes; actually he would have had pretty *dead* genes, because the environment <br>
of a long time ago was inhospitable to his type of problem.  Now the <br>
environment that humans are living in is quite different than what they lived <br>
in a while ago, and it can support genetic deviations which previous <br>
environments wouldn't.  The universe can maintain biological systems now (such <br>
as people with cerebral palsy, diabetes, hemophilia, etc.) which would have <br>
been automatically cast off a while ago.  There's nothing wrong with saving <br>
people like that.  Besides, with genetic engineering, we will be able to get <br>
rid of whatever undesirable genes we want to.  We are not "cheating <br>
evolution".<br>
<p>
-(here's where I break into a rant against one of my favorite enemy memes; <br>
it's not directed at Chris or anyone else here -- just at all the idiots out <br>
there who think that humans are interfering with Nature.)-<br>
<p>
We *are* letting evolution take it's course.  It is absolutely, completely and <br>
in all other ways totally impossible for us to interfere with the process of <br>
evolution in any way whatsoever!  How could we *not* let evolution take it's <br>
course?  We are parts of that very process!  We are not magically outside the <br>
system!  Everything we do is *100% natural.*  The word, "unnatural", points to <br>
nothing;  it is absolutely *impossible* for anything to be "unnatural".  <br>
Nature is *everything*.  <br>
<p>
Our technology is as natural as a coral reef or a termite mound -- it's what <br>
humans *do*;  playing around with things and figuring out what we can do with <br>
them and improving things for ourselves comes so naturally and instinctively <br>
to humans that it is impossible to prevent humans from developing technology.  <br>
The tools we create are as much a part of us as our fingernails.  It is in our <br>
nature to take advantage of our environments and use whatever resources we <br>
find or develop for our own benefit.  All living creatures do this -- every <br>
living creature snaps up whatever resources it needs, whenever the resources <br>
are available.  Technology develops because humans have such a fascination <br>
with each other and a strong tendency to mimic each other.  This same sort of <br>
activity occurs in bee hives, this intense fascination and mimicry of each <br>
other, and the bees have developed a fairly advanced culture and an <br>
impressively elaborate technology of building hives and honey combs, which is <br>
passed on through each generation of bees.  <br>
<p>
We are *natural*!  We are not some sort of freaks, cast into the natural world <br>
from the outside.  We came from nature;  we *are* nature, in a very intimate <br>
way, and there's nothing we can do to seperate ourselves from nature.  Nature <br>
is constantly changing itself into new forms.  We are a part of that process <br>
of transformation.  If anyone is "unnatural", it is all the idiots who want to <br>
"go back to nature".  Nature is not so stagnant!  Nature continues to press <br>
onward, building up greater and greater complexity, continually transforming <br>
itself.  Nature itself is basically a process of technology, a process of <br>
building on what came before and making everything more and more elaborate.  <br>
Our technological development perfectly mirrors the evolution of life.  <br>
Technology and culture are constantly engaged in the processes of variation <br>
and selection.  Humanity is human's technology and culture, and it is a very <br>
large and complex living organism.  As far as I'm concerned, those who are <br>
against technology are basically against Humanity itself (actually, I think <br>
they are just misguided; they have a great deal of anger and resentment <br>
against something and they are wanting to be rebellious and they just happen <br>
to buy into the anti-technology memes.  Other rebellious and discontented <br>
people buy into some other anti-__ meme.).<br>
<p>
rant, rant; &lt;pant&gt;, &lt;pant&gt;<br>
<p>
There.  I feel much better now.  <br>
