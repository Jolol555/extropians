In fact, it would be great fun, and worth doing intellectually, to run<br>
a game-theoretic simulation of this problem. <br>
..<br>
Star systems might also consider lying low until their technological<br>
advancement seems to asymptote, and suddenly "running for it".  Grow<br>
the local economy as fast as possible, not worrying much about being<br>
loud, to support a massive explosion of colonization probes.  They<br>
might get 10^10 to 10^20 probes out of the system off to all corners<br>
of the universe before enemies arrive.  Or considering the costs and<br>
risks of strong central policing, they might decide to just run for it<br>
from the very beginning.<br>
<p>
[[This is a lot like the strategy of a viral infection. In this<br>
scenario, there are probes coming _into_ the Milky Way Galaxy <br>
from all corners of the Universe (unless the Great Filter is in our <br>
past or near future, of course). With the competition this fierce,<br>
the best places for the long term may be the less desireable real <br>
estate- the dark matter galactic halos, the Great Voids (here's where<br>
you send the big starships), perhaps the interiors of stars.<br>
<i>]]</i><br>
<p>
==============================================<br>
The strategic situation of a potential berserker is also complicated.<br>
If they see a sign of a new civilization, and they send a probe to<br>
destroy it, it might be a trap which lets someone else find them and<br>
destroy them.  If there are many other civilizations around, why<br>
should they be the one to spend the resources and take the risk to<br>
destroy the newcomer?  And if they wait a bit, and still no one else<br>
destroys it, that may just be because others have send probes to sit<br>
near this new site, waiting [to] catch incoming destroyers. <br>
<p>
[[Ah. I'll add this to the list of directives in 'low profile'. It is<br>
implicit in the current list, but this clarifies it..]]<br>
<p>
===========================================<br>
It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the<br>
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the<br>
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,<br>
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years.<br>
That huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new<br>
technology, so some of your descendants become as advanced as your<br>
advanced enemies.<br>
<p>
[[One showstopper is the possibilty of a speed of light pulse<br>
(perhaps even an electromagnetic pulse of unspeakable amplitude),<br>
 used as a last resort weapon against just such an expansion.<br>
 It is my<br>
intuition that no matter what level a civilization reaches, its <br>
"people"<br>
cannot ever be sure they know all the possibilities of mind and of <br>
technology that are permitted in this Multiverse.<br>
