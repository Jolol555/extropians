<i>&gt; almost insignificantly small subset of all possible ways of thinking.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that nearly all ways of thinking are incomprehensible to the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind.  Shit, most of the ideas I think about would be nearly incomprehensible</i><br>
<i>&gt; to anyone not as intimately familiar with my mind as I am.  Nearly everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think is impossible to translate into language that other humans would</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand (I do try my best, though.  But what I'm able to translate is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; a small subset of my thinking).  I think the situation would be even worse</i><br>
<i>&gt; with aliens.  Communication is only possible among sufficiently similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems.  Communication is a form of resonance, a way for one system to cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; another to behave similarly.  The greater the resonance, the greater the</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication between two systems.  If two systems aren't similar enough, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't cause each other to resonate together.  They can't mimic each other to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; high enough degree to be considered to be communicating.  Human minds share</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough similarities that they can create sensory experiences for each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; which cause their minds to think similarly about various things.  We can guess</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mental patterns of another human, based on how they're acting (what sounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're making, what bodily movements they're expressing, things like that).</i><br>
<i>&gt; We're good enough at guessing each other's mental states that we can maintain</i><br>
<i>&gt; a reasonable level of communication.  And the better we get to know someone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the more accurately we learn to guess what they're thinking, based on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions.  I don't think we'd have much luck guessing what a being truly alien</i><br>
<i>&gt; was thinking.  Not well enough to communicate, I think.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that one of the basic reasons that humans have even the low level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication that we do is because we mimic each other so much.  We mimic</i><br>
<i>&gt; each other's forms of expression so much that we have developed a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; common forms of expression that we use with each other.  Thus, we build a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of similar memories.  We also have grown up in similar cultural and physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments, so we have at least some common ground.  I see no reason to</i><br>
<i>&gt; expect that aliens will have much at all in common with us in our thinking and</i><br>
<i>&gt; our ways of doing things.</i><br>

Sorry Dave, that sounds like psychomystical claptrap to me. The fact is<br>
that using mathematics, and our knowledge of the physical laws, we<br>
already have a Rosetta Stone to relate with any technological society of<br>
aliens. If they were non technological, I'm not sure it would be so<br>
easy. The fact that we would be two intelligent races with scientists<br>
makes for a huge overlap of common ground from which to build greater<br>
communication.<br>
<p>
Who ever said that humans have a  "low" level of communication?<br>
<p>
The fact that any one human can have such diverse thoughts shows that we<br>
have the diversity of thought to communicate with many different modes<br>
of intelligent existence. Now I know the first objection is gonna be<br>
"What about the whales? we can't understand them and they have such big<br>
brains they MUST be intelligent." Wrong. Their minds are almost totally<br>
occupied with  the vast signal processing required by their sonar<br>
system. Did you know that they can create a sonic image of the whole<br>
pacific ocean? That takes major processing. That does not leave much<br>
room for abstract thought. Plus if you look at their brian mass to body<br>
mass ratio, they would still be far below humans, as are all othr earth<br>
animals.<br>
<p>
For support of my scientific Rosetta Stone idea, I direct you to read H.<br>
Beam Piper's short story collection "Federation" (this was long before<br>
star trek), in which a human expedition to Mars uncovers a dead<br>
civilization. They think they can't ever decode the language till they<br>
come across a Martian copy of the table of the elements.....<br>
