I mentioned that I have been working on changing the ways I think and take in <br>
information over the past few years, and that I have been making myself <br>
several times more intelligent in the process.  Suresh Naidu responded:<br>
<p>
"Really. Could give me some of the techniques you have been using. I would <br>
certainly appreciate any methods of making myself more intelligent.<br>
How do you alter your ways of taking in information? More diverse media? How <br>
do you improve your observational and thinking skills. I just wrote a <br>
programming competition today, and I watched as I was stumped on one problem, <br>
a couple of people were burning up the score rankings. What makes a person <br>
have insights?"<br>
<p>
My efforts to consciously increase my intelligence and my perceptual abilities <br>
were inspired a few years ago by reading Frank Herbert's wonderful book, Dune. <br>
 The main characters in the book were trained to be very perceptive and pay <br>
close attention to subtle details.  This was something that interested me very <br>
much; to increase the clarity of my perceptions, to see more detail.  So I <br>
began working on sensory training.<br>
<p>
I started looking at things more intently, trying to see more detail, paying <br>
attention to notice everything I could about what I saw.  I go for walks quite <br>
often, and I try to pay attention to the exact details of things, not <br>
necessarily to remember the details, but to at least notice them.  I look at <br>
the trees as I'm walking past and try to see the bark in as much detail as I <br>
can, for example, and I try to do this with everything.  I notice all the cars <br>
driving by, all the birds flying, all the people walking around, the leaves <br>
fluttering on the trees, the way the clouds look in the sky, that piece of <br>
garbage being blown by the wind and the exact way it tumbles around; I try to <br>
notice everything I can.  I have taught myself to enjoy seeing things in great <br>
detail, and so I actively seek to see more and more detail, and this gives me <br>
great pleasure, so I keep trying to increase the resolution, increase the <br>
bandwidth.  I've learned to use all of my eyes' visual fields instead of just <br>
the center of them.  I have increased the amount of detail I see with my <br>
peripherial vision, as well as the amount of detail I see in the center of my <br>
eyes, so it has had the effect of widening my visual field, since I'm now make <br>
active use of all of it.  <br>
<p>
I've done the same type of thing to my other senses as well.  I have made it <br>
extremely pleasurable to hear things in great detail, to hear and distinguish <br>
all of the many sounds going on all around me at the same time.  I have <br>
trained myself to find great pleasure in feeling the exact textures of the <br>
things I touch.  When I eat, I pay great attention to the exact way the food <br>
feels in all parts of my mouth, exactly how it tastes, how it smells, <br>
everything.  I try to pay close attention to the "exactness" of everything.  I <br>
have made this my goal, and when I acheive my goal each moment, I experience <br>
pleasure, and so I try to experience things even more exactly, and I <br>
experience even greater pleasure.<br>
<p>
Basically, it's a matter of focusing one's attention on the details of the <br>
present moment.  And when the mind drifts off into its habitual thinking, I <br>
refocus it on the exactness of my present experience.  I keep reminding <br>
myself, Pay Attention, Pay Attention.  At first, it was very difficult to pay <br>
attention to things, but it becomes easier with practice.  The things I was <br>
working on a few months ago, I now do automatically, and it takes no effort to <br>
experience the degree of detail I struggled so hard to perceive earlier.  And <br>
now I still have many perceptual challenges, and I'm still working on <br>
increasing my observational abilities, and one day, these challenges will seem <br>
easy to me, and I will have still more refinement to make to my perceptual <br>
abilities.  There's just too much information to take ALL of it in, but I keep <br>
working to increase the amount I do take in.<br>
<p>
So, my first interest was in increasing the amount of detail I experienced.  <br>
Then I started applying the same techniques to my thoughts and feelings, and <br>
I've worked very hard to pay close attention to what goes on in my mind.  I <br>
always try to know my thoughts more clearly, to be aware more exactly what I'm <br>
thinking.  When I react to things, I try to keep track of exactly what I was <br>
thinking and feeling and what memories were brought up and what associations <br>
were made.  I keep working on experiencing my thoughts in greater detail.  I <br>
look for patterns in my thinking and explore why I think the way I do.  When I <br>
experience emotions, I go into them as deeply as I can and try to feel the <br>
exactness of what I'm feeling.  I watch all the memories that the emotions <br>
bring up, and I try to keep track of what thoughts and experiences seemed to <br>
trigger the emotions.<br>
<p>
By watching my own thinking so closely, I notice thinking errors more easily <br>
and those errors get discontinued very quickly.  Also, as I learn to pay <br>
attention to more information, I am more aware of the background "noise" in my <br>
mind; all the loose ends and the thinking that usually trails off and doesn't <br>
go anywhere because it doesn't get paid attention to and followed up on.  I am <br>
aware of more of these random thoughts and associations going on, and I follow <br>
up on many more ideas than I used to and evaluate many more ideas than I used <br>
to.  Now it seems like my mind is in a perpetual brainstorming session.  I see <br>
all these ideas springing up and dying out.  The interesting ones get more <br>
attention and develop further, and the other ones just go away.  Because I am <br>
aware of more of my thinking, I am more aware of the random good ideas which <br>
spring up, and I am now almost constanly in a state of insight.  This gives me <br>
great pleasure, and it encourages me to pay even more attention to my <br>
thinking.  Also, exposing myself to diverse media (reading lots of books, <br>
seeing lots of movies, surfing the Internet, reading lots of magazines, <br>
looking at lots of art, listening to lots of music, etc.) helps refine my <br>
thinking even more, since I see examples of other people's actions and <br>
reasoning and can incorporate the good ideas into my own way of doing things <br>
and thinking.<br>
<p>
One powerful technique I use to develop my reasoning skills and to clarify my <br>
thinking is to carry on imaginary conversations constantly in my mind.  I have <br>
many different models of thinking and different personalities that I've <br>
developed in my mind, and I have these different personalities discuss ideas <br>
with each other and explain things to each other.  Having to translate my <br>
ideas into many different personality and belief structures helps me clarify <br>
them and spot errors in them, and many of the different personalities are <br>
quick to point out each others' errors.  Also, when I'm learning something <br>
new, I imagine that I'm explaining it to someone else, and I imagine what <br>
questions they might ask, and I think how I would answer them, and if I don't <br>
have a good answer, then I seek out that information.  The internal discussion <br>
is an excellent way to test out ideas, and as I learn to pay more attention to <br>
the inner workings of my mind, I am able to develop more complex personalities <br>
and thinking styles and able to be aware of more elaborate conversations going <br>
on inside myself.  Most of the personalities I've developed come from <br>
simulating people I know, in my mind, by creating a mini-society in my own <br>
mind, based on real people in my life and people I see in movies or read about <br>
in books.<br>
<p>
But my main technique for increasing my intelligence is to pay intense <br>
attention to all aspects of my experience and to continually work on <br>
increasing the level of my attention.  This takes a great deal of dedication <br>
and personal discipline.  I try to make it as enjoyable as possible so that I <br>
am more motivated to continue my work.  I also have trained myself to feel <br>
pleasure at accomplishing my goals.  I go outside for a walk, and everything <br>
looks so vibrant and clear, I hear all the sounds of the neighborhood all <br>
around me, I feel the patterns of air moving across my face and arms and my <br>
clothes rubbing gently on my skin as I move, and I feel elated, and I want to <br>
experience even more.  It has taken a while to build up this response, but it <br>
keeps getting stronger the more I work on it.  Also, the more attention I pay <br>
to things, the faster I learn them.<br>
<p>
Another strategy I use to increase my ability to pay close attention to things <br>
is to engage in activities which are pleasurable anyway and then pay close <br>
attention to everything I'm experiencing while engaging in that activity.  <br>
Eating and masturbation can be excellent activities for training the mind, if <br>
they're approached that way.  As funny as it may seem, fantasizing about <br>
sexual encounters can be an excellent way to develop a powerful imagination, <br>
if you keep trying to increase the vividness of the fantasy.  Sexual fantasy <br>
is very pleasurable, and the more vivid it seems, the more pleasurable it is, <br>
so there is a great motivation to increase the power of the imagination.  <br>
Then, you can use your more powerful imagination for other things besides <br>
sexual fantasies, perhaps inventing some wonderful new machine, or thinking up <br>
a beautiful new artwork to create.  But the basic idea is to provide yourself <br>
with strong motivation to increase your ability to pay attention to things in <br>
great detail.  This ability can be applied to many aspects of your life, and I <br>
have used it to increase the level of my intelligence several times over, in <br>
the past few years.  It's been a lot of hard work, but it's been very <br>
enjoyable, because I've made it that way.  And it keeps getting easier to <br>
raise my intelligence even more, the more I learn and the more intelligent I <br>
become.  <br>
<p>
Also, my sense of time has gotten pretty warped because of my work.  Now, a <br>
single day can seem as long as several weeks used to seem.  My thinking has <br>
speeded up considerably, along with the amount of information I process in a <br>
given amount of time.<br>
<p>
When I would take acid a few years ago, I thought it was really cool, but the <br>
thing I didn't like is that it would wear off and the effects would go away.  <br>
Now, because of my work, my ordinary experiences are more intense and <br>
wonderful than anything I ever experienced on acid.  It feels like I'm on acid <br>
all the time even though I'm not, but I don't seem to be coming down from the <br>
trip; I just keep going up, and things just keep getting more interesting, so <br>
very, very fascinating.<br>
