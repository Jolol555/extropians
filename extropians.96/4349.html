I sent a "who extropians" message this morning, and found that <br>
Mr. Brin is no longer on the list...  unless he's using an alias!   <br>

No, I was referring to someone else.  But that reminds me of a story.  <br>
A teacher was grading papers and found two that were obviously <br>
plagiarized.  He went to class the next day and said  "I found some <br>
plagiarized papers.  I don't want to embarrass you in front of the class, <br>
but you know who you are.  Please come to see me in my office this <br>
afternoon."  When he arrived at his office, half the class was there.  <br>
