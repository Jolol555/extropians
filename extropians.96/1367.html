Eric Watt Forste wrote 9/27/96: &lt;Is it not possible for someone to help you with<br>
regard to one aspect of your values while simultaneously hindering you with<br>
regard to some other aspect of your values?&gt;<br>
<p>
Certainly.  Fortunately, you have clarified the priorities of your life, you<br>
have a coherency of values clustering around your highest purposes, which<br>
support each other.  This has allowed you to refine your judgments with<br>
experience, to have honed your emotional acuity, your powers of discrimination.<br>
The fine art of compromise, so essential to civilization, comes into full play<br>
here, this is what makes life so interesting.  You'll know when you've been<br>
helped overall vs. hindered.<br>
<p>
Of course, if you have incoherent values, or are tugged in opposing life<br>
directions, then you're just bobbing on the waves anyway.<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;I suspect it would depend on the situation.&gt;<br>
<p>
Ha ha!  Situational ethics, the NEA's biggest support for statist miseducation<br>
monopoly.<br>
<p>
EHF: &lt;But even if I decided it was a hindrance (for instance, because the<br>
mistake in question was not a very important one), I'd probably choose to be<br>
tolerant of such things.&gt;<br>
<p>
Exactly, you only tolerate unimportant intentions or actions.  The tolerated<br>
know they are unimportant.  It's very grating to them.<br>
<p>
EHF: &lt;As for your assertions about "only one thing can happen at a time", do you<br>
disagree that there are many computations being carried out in different parts<br>
of the brain simultaneously at any given moment?&gt;<br>
<p>
Assertion, huh?  Does this indicate that you also think that two contradictory<br>
events can occur at the same place, at the same time?  Sheesh!  Where could<br>
objectivity arise if this were the case?  I disagree that any computations at<br>
all take place in the sense I think you are using the word.  I agree that when I<br>
think 1 + 1 = 2, that a computation has occurred in my brain, subjectively, of<br>
course, since there is no way for anyone to look into my brain and "know" what I<br>
just did, with certainty.  Of course, I can't simultaneously do the computation<br>
1 + 1 = 2 and 1 + 1 = 3, not at the exact same time, although I suspect some<br>
gifted accountants may be able to do it.  As to computations at the molecular,<br>
or atomic, or sub-atomic level, which is what I think you are referring to here,<br>
they are epistemological models we impose on whatever is actually going on in<br>
there, most likely just bits of stuff bumping around in preferred directions,<br>
the path of least resistance and all.  Yes, this stuff is bumping all around in<br>
the brain, but not contradictory events at the same place, at the same time.<br>
<p>
EWF: &lt;That is, do you deny parallelism and think that cognition only occurs at<br>
the focus of attention and that the human brain is not capable of "background<br>
processing", as it were?&gt;<br>
<p>
Not at all.  Searle's concept of the "background" is very useful.  So is<br>
Gelertner's "spectrum of attention" in "The Muse in the Machine".  I believe<br>
that the centrality of attention, has to do with the fact that motor action is<br>
sequential, because time is sequential.  PET's and SQUID's have shown very<br>
fascinating shifting patterns of activity over wide areas of the brain, but if<br>
you take a snapshot at an instant of time, the scans don't produce two pictures<br>
showing totally opposite areas of activity, the scans produce one picture,<br>
showing one event at one place.  Of course, the time it takes to process the<br>
pictures is much longer than the Planck moment time scales, so the pictures<br>
really are smears of activity anyway.<br>
