<i>&gt; If the individuals who first attain "godhood" are so indifferent </i><br>
<i>&gt; or even hostile toward their brothers and sisters who have </i><br>
<i>&gt; not yet ascended, we would wind up as advocates not of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; next step, but of the final mistake. </i><br>
<p>
Brothers and sisters?  All those cretins who are overrunning this planet <br>
are my brothers and sisters?  I think that's a pretty offensive notion.  <br>
I wonder what your agenda is, Michael.  Are you simply trying to <br>
obfuscate this list with ongoing snide remarks intended to piss people <br>
off?   If so, I don't particularly like having you on the list, dude.  <br>
You and your "Lorrey Drive" belong on alt.crackpot.inventors.  <br>

<i>&gt; Film evidence does exist of the use of the gas chambers and other </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazi experiments--Hitler demanded visual and written record that </i><br>
<i>&gt; his orders were being carried out.  These films are, of course, </i><br>
<i>&gt; too explicit to have been released to the public, but they are used </i><br>
<i>&gt; in military classes on atrocities and by researchers.  </i><br>
<p>
Oh...  I guess that settles it.  So, film evidence does exist after all. <br>
Of course -- of course! -- these films are only available to military <br>
classes and researchers.  Naturally.  Thanks, Kathryn.  I wish you had <br>
told me that last year, it would have saved me a lot of trouble.  <br>
I won't be a revisionist anymore.  There's no use arguing with films <br>
ordered by Hitler himself.  I'll be a good boy from now on.  <br>
