<i>&gt; I have to agree with you on this one, Eliezer.  I've seen this idea</i><br>

<i>&gt; of variations on this theme, each with a different mechanical</i><br>
<i>&gt; implementation.  Both of them produce a motion similar to what is</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown in the animation on the Lorrey Drive web page.  Neither of</i><br>
<i>&gt; them work.  The Lorrey Drive may be different in implementation, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is still the same in principle and carries with it the same fatal</i><br>
<i>&gt; flaw as Pawlicki's variants.  Devices of this kind cannot work.</i><br>

I know Pawlicki. I also know that he had a live demonstration on<br>
Canadian Public Radio of his demonstrator. It did work, though it was so<br>
imbalanced and poorly designed that it self destructed once it finished<br>
a few trips across the room. What I put on the page was a very _basic_<br>
example. What I am using for my own demonstrator is much more<br>
sophisticated. It will not produce torque on the whole system, it will<br>
produce a thrust curve that is flat, rather than sine waved as Pawlickis<br>
did. He never understood the whole concept, and was never able to take<br>
it beyond his simple design. <br>
<p>
I was expecting this sort of response from many.<br>
