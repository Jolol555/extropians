No, the implications are much wider that that, it's true for any finite being. <br>
In 1930 Godel proven that any logical system, such as a computer or a finite <br>
mind, can not be both consistent and complete. Most will insist on consistency  <br>
so there are some things no logical system with a finite number of axioms can<br>
solve, or to put it another way, there are some problems no computer can solve <br>
in a finite amount of time.  If we could identify what those un solvable we <br>
could then ignore them and concentrate on problems that do have a solution, <br>
but in 1935 Turing proved we can't do that  either. There are some statements <br>
that are either false of true but have no proof and we (or a finite God) <br>
can't even tell what those statements are. <br>
<p>
For example, take the Goldbach Conjecture, it states that every even number <br>
greater that 4 is the sum of two odd  primes  (all the primes except 1 and 2). <br>
Let's try it for some numbers:<br>
<p>
6=3+3  <br>
8=5+5   <br>
10=3+7   <br>
12=5+7     <br>
14=3+11   <br>
16=3+13   <br>
18=7+11 <br>
20=3+17 <br>
22=5+17  <br>
24=7+17  <br>
26=7+19  <br>
28=11+17  <br>
30=11+19<br>
<p>
This all looks very promising, but is it true for ALL even numbers? Checking <br>
all even numbers one by one would take an infinite  number of steps, to test <br>
it in finite number of steps we need a proof, but I don't have one, nobody <br>
does. The Goldbach Conjecture was first proposed in 1742  ( 1742=1729+13 ) <br>
and since that time all the top minds in mathematics have looked for a proof <br>
but have come up empty. Well, perhaps we can't prove it because it's not true, <br>
however modern computers have looked for a counterexample, they've gone up to <br>
a trillion or so and it works every time. Now a trillion is a big number but <br>
it's no closer to being infinite than the number 1 is, so perhaps The Goldbach <br>
Conjecture will fail at a trillion +2 or a trillion to the trillionth power. <br>
It's also possible that some brilliant mathematician will come up with a proof <br>
tomorrow, as recently happened with Fermat's last theorem , but there is yet <br>
another possibility, it could be un- provable.<br>
<p>
The Goldbach Conjecture is either true or it's not, Godel and Turing never <br>
denied that, the question is,  will ever know if it's true or not?  According <br>
to Godel  some statements are un-provable, if The Goldbach Conjecture is one <br>
of these it means that it's true so we'll never find a counterexample to prove <br>
it wrong, and it also means we'll never find a proof to show it's correct. <br>
Turing showed that if If it's un-provable we will never know it's un-provable, <br>
Godel just said that such statements exists but we can never positively <br>
identify one.  A billion years from now, whatever hyper intelligent entities <br>
we will have become will still be deep in thought looking, unsuccessfully, <br>
for a proof and still  grinding away at numbers looking, unsuccessfully, <br>
for a counterexample.<br>
<p>
We could avoid this fate if we at least prove that it's either untrue or <br>
un-provable. If we could do that we still wouldn't know if it was true or not, <br>
but it would tell us to stop spinning our wheels by trying to prove it and we <br>
could turn to other things that we could prove. Unfortunately Turing showed 5<br>
years after  Godel that even that was not possible.<br>
<p>
If we get frustrated enough could we just add Goldbach as an axiom? Not a <br>
good idea, great care should be exercised before you add an axiom, otherwise <br>
some day you could find out that The Goldbach conjecture is untrue but we <br>
find a proof anyway: The conclusion is ...Disaster!!! Mathematics is in BIG, <br>
BIG trouble, it's inconsistent, and that's much worse than just being <br>
incomplete.  Mathematicians must be incompetent, for they have utterly <br>
botched the foundations of their science by building mathematics on a base <br>
made of sand.  They should be looking for a new line of work, something <br>
they're better at, I hear there are  openings at Burger King. Fortunately <br>
this scenario is very unlikely.   Consider the other possibilities:<br>
<p>
1) The Goldbach conjecture is true and it is possible to find a proof:   <br>
   In this case adding  Goldbach as a Axiom is unnecessary and inelegant.<br>
<p>
3) The Goldbach conjecture is untrue but we add it as an axiom: Bad idea, now <br>
   you've made mathematics inconsistent, think of the embarrassment when some <br>
   computer finds a number that violates Goldbach, your axiom.<br>
<p>
3) The Goldbach conjecture is true but unprovable:   In this case it would be <br>
   a great idea to add Goldbach as an axiom because then your axiomatic <br>
   system would be more complete and just as consistent.  The only trouble is, <br>
   if it's unprovable you'll never know it, so it's just too dangerous to take <br>
   the chance.<br>
<p>
                                                                <br>
<i>                &gt;Words mean what you say they mean........</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes,  but if you're using a word it a unusual way you must define it for me. <br>
On the other hand I will never ask you for a definition of the word <br>
"definition" because If I already know then it would be a waste of time, and <br>
if I don't your answer would be meaningless. If you use a word I'm unfamiliar <br>
with, like  klognee, I certainly won't ask you for the klognee of "klognee".<br>
