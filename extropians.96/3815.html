A couple things here Chris:<br>
<p>
Why would you want to pay $25/month for your domain name?  The Internic fee<br>
amounts to less than $5/month and they are accruing &gt;$10 million a year from<br>
the fees alone.<br>
<p>
InterNIC is *not* a US Gov't organization.<br>
<p>
InterNIC does not do a background check.  They don't even enforce the<br>
current heirarchy.<br>
<p>
<p>
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY:<br>
Arbitrary, unstructured domain names will significantly impact the already<br>
mediocre performance of the DNS system.  In fact, it could pretty much kill<br>
the root-level DNS servers due to loading.  *Not* a good idea.<br>
<p>
And lastly, your post was packed to the gills with reactionary phrases like<br>
"overthrow the gov't centralized InterNIC" and "residues leftover from...the<br>
military-founded ARPAnet" which are generally misleading, and more to the<br>
point, irrelevant.  It sounds like this guy has the "meme" concept down to a<br>
science because you bought into it hook, line, and sinker.<br>
<p>
This guy has been pushing the idea for about a year.  At $25/month, this guy<br>
would make millions.  No wonder he is pushing it so hard.  <br>
