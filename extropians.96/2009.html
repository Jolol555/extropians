finite resources are false through technology because you could make <br>

probably the oil companies will never go out of business.<br>

Infinity is a theory, a myth. Any kind of sentient being, with its roots <br>
in our primate past, that experiences the kind of infinity you're talking <br>
about, would be so unrecognizable to us, that their environment is not <br>
only not predictable, but it CANNOT be predicted.<br>
<p>
 Also, _are_ the oil companies stifling technology or is that just <br>
another urban meme.<br>
<p>
Thank you for the meme/myth juxtaposition. Every industry attempts to <br>
stifle its competition. The dinosaurs tried to kill the smaller, more <br>
agile mammals.<br>
There's a wonderful metaphor for this in Dawkin's book "The Selfish <br>
Gene."<br>
