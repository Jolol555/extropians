I don't think we can image it well yet, but in PET or FMRI scans it is <br>
visible as an activity increase in the visual cortices. Yes, there are <br>
several high-level cortices dealing with vision, and presumably the <br>
purple walrus will exist as activity in some of them. V1 (the "classic" <br>
visual cortex) deals mostly with what we really see (plus what our brain <br>
extrapolates from it), while V2-V5 seem to deal with various aspects of <br>
it (color, movement, edges etc). I think sensory information gradually <br>
gets integrated with general activity in the association cortices, and <br>
very hard to identify. <br>

<p>
If you applied the right stimuli to V1 the person would see the walrus, <br>
but at higher levels the result would probably be more like suddenly <br>
envisioning it. <br>
