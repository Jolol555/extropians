This is true, but there are other FTL or time travel (CTC) solutions of<br>
GR, such as the Alcubierre warp drive, passing cosmic strings or<br>
traversable wormholes. Of the allowable manifolds, a quite sizeable subset<br>
have such beasties (anybody who knows if the measure of CTC manifolds in<br>
the space of all possible GR manifolds is zero, one or somewhere<br>
between?). <br>

Well, if the cylinder blows up, doesn't there exist a tiny window of time <br>
where you can move backwards in time before the shock front reaches you or <br>
the metric change destroys the CTC properties?<br>
<p>
My guess is that general FTL (as opposed to "tame" FTL which doesn't<br>
violate causality) and general time travel will not be possible either<br>
<p>
1. due to quantum effects, such as the Visser virtual particle blowup that<br>
ought to occur (at least in a first approximation, if I have understood<br>
his papers right) when two wormhole ends get too close to form a CTC. This<br>
mechanism ought to occur in other potential causality violations such as<br>
the cosmic string trick and might<br>
<p>
2. due to that the universe is always consistent, so any time travelling <br>
will be constrained by its past (you can "change" it, but only so that it <br>
becomes identical with your own past). See the papers by Novikov about <br>
this fun area (I love his time-travelling billiard trick, which Forward <br>
used in _Timemaster_).<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I think "tame" FTL and time travel is possible, as<br>
constrained by the results of Khatsymovsky (you can do FTL, but only<br>
inside your future light-cone). I.e. you can build wormhole empires and do<br>
apparent FTL, but not violate causality or build generalized time<br>
machines. <br>
