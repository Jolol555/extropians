<i>&gt;I have resided on a list-within-list structure, but the inner list </i><br>

<i>&gt;inner list, which could not be read by the outer list.  </i><br>

<p>
Having the inner list not openly readable is different from my<br>
proposal.  But you haven't mentioned the most important thing - did<br>
the inner list work well for insiders?  If so, sounds like a success<br>
story.<br>

I'm not sure you'll get people to put in this effort, but I have no<br>
objection to your trying it.<br>

What is the difference between this and a moderated "best of" list?<br>
I don't see how it is any less objectionable on elitism grounds.<br>
