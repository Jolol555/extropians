You're kidding! &lt;eyes glaze over in delight&gt; This has got to be the most <br>
fascinating thing I've yet to read on this list. Does the AI still post? <br>
Or is this some sort of Evil Extropian prank? <br>
<p>
Evil Extropians is my current thought experiment. What if a group of <br>
ne'er do wells broke off from the extropians and set their minds to world <br>
domination? Better yet, to galactic domination. How would they use the <br>
info gleaned from this list?<br>
