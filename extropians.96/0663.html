From: daemon@anon.penet.fi<br>
To: Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de<br>
Subject: Anon.penet.fi is closed!<br>
<p>
Due to both the ever-increasing workload and the current uncertain legal<br>
status of the privacy of e-mail in Finland, I have now closed down this<br>
service until further notice. For now, you can still mail NON-ANONYMOUSLY<br>
to existing anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi users using the naXXXXX@anon.penet.fi<br>
address convention, so that you might establish another way to communicate<br>
with people you only know by their anon.penet.fi address, but news postings<br>
and anonymous mail is not supported. <br>
<p>
To use the non-anonymous forwarding service, you have to modify the anon<br>
address by swapping the first two letters (an to na, standing for Not<br>
Anonymous), so that an123456@anon.penet.fi becomes na123456@anon.penet.fi. <br>
But remember that your address will *not* be removed - this method is only<br>
intended as a stop-gap to enable you to establish another way of communicating<br>
with the people you only know by their anon.penet.fi addresses. <br>
<p>
If you feel that the service has been valuable, you can send a letter of <br>
support to support@anon.penet.fi, and likewise, if you feel it is a good<br>
thing the remailer has gone off the air, you can use the address<br>
against@anon.penet.fi to outline your reasons. As people always ask me<br>
why anyone would need a service such as anon.penet.fi, I am collecting<br>
case stories at why@anon.penet.fi.<br>
<p>
I have now maintained this service for over 3 years, and as there have<br>
appeared a number of other similar, reliable and well maintained servers,<br>
I feel we have reached a situation where the current anon.penet.fi<br>
server can be retired. Thank you for a very interesting time on the net!<br>
