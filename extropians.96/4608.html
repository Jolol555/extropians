I think another solution would be to create topical lists.  "Extropian"<br>
covers a wide spectrum of possible topics.  What some people may view as<br>
noise, may be of significant interest to other people on the list.  <br>
<p>
I can personally say that I do not usually read certain types of threads on<br>
this list.  Not because these threads are not extropian topics, and not<br>
because the threads are low in quality, but simply because my interests do<br>
not align with the people actively engaged in these threads.<br>
<p>
I would appreciate topical lists.  It would allow me more precise control of<br>
what I want to read.  And the ability to select specific discussion lists<br>
will have the apparent effect of increasing the signal to noise ratio for<br>
many people.<br>
