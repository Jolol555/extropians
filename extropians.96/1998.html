David D. writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If gene therapy for humans started at least by 1990, then wouldn't it be </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to use that technology for genetic re-creation. Example: If I </i><br>
<i>&gt; had the money and the right doctor, could I isolate the "novelty" gene, </i><br>
<i>&gt; whip up an elixir, shot it up (or perhaps inhale it in aerosol form), to </i><br>
<i>&gt; give myself a "high" that made me want to pursue "novel" (or perhaps </i><br>
<i>&gt; there's an extropian gene) ideas, ways and means?  </i><br>
<p>
You can do that anyway.  You don't need gene therapy.  The genes are <br>
already there, we all have them, it's just a matter of turning them on.  <br>
<p>
Suppose you did have an aerosol.  Imagine inhaling it.  It goes deep <br>
into your lungs.  Time slows down, deja vu, timewarp, and in a matter <br>
of seconds you have fallen down an infinite well and left your old life <br>
behind, and entered into a new life, in a new universe, a shimmering <br>
dancing multi-dimensional universe, filled with  mmmm everywhere, in <br>
your mind, mmmmmm...   and it becomes more and more fine grained <br>
until it reaches an infinite frequency, and you float in it.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From there you can go anywhere.  New ideas will come so fast </i><br>
you can't write them down.  <br>
