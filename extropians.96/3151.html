Subject: NutraSweet making World News: Please send us all case histories<br>
<p>
<p>
Dr. John Olney made World News in his article on aspartame and brain<br>
tumors published in the Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental<br>
Neurology.  But the work he was citing was Dr. H. J. Roberts peer reviewed<br>
report on brain tumors and aspartame we have on our auto-responder that we<br>
have been talking about for years.  It was always known and we have the<br>
secret trade information where it was stated in a memo before it was<br>
marked that it broke down into DKP, a brain tumor agent (from the<br>
phenylalanine).  This secret trade information was discussed in the<br>
Congressioanl Hearings but nothing was done about it.<br>
<p>
At the World Environmental Conference last November Dr. Clarice Gaylord of<br>
the EPA announced an epidemic of MS and lupus but said they could not<br>
identify the toxin.  I explained I was there to lecture on MS and identify<br>
the toxin as NutraSweet.  And it has caused an epidemic of lupus which<br>
usually becomes asymptomatic as you soon as you get the patient off.  But<br>
patients are suffering from methanol toxicity from aspartame.<br>
<p>
Dr. Roberts book DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMERS DISEASE explains how it is<br>
escalating Alzheimers, and has been nominated for a Pultizer.<br>
<p>
He has written a new medical text called ASPARTAME DISEASE which has not<br>
been published, as aspartame disease is now epidemic.  Dr. Roberts<br>
publications can be gotten at 1 800 -814 -9800.<br>
<p>
Turn on your TV, its been on CNN about every 15 minutes, and just about<br>
every station.  We are very concerned about aviation as pilots talk about<br>
grand mal seizures, black outs, heart problems, central nervous system<br>
problems, and loss of vision.  <br>
<p>
Information is on our auto-responder and check the web.  We can give you<br>
web sites.  The news is out and an investigation began today in<br>
Washington.<br>
