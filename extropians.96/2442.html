<i>&gt; &gt;Here is an example.  In 1989 I met Leslie Graves, my favorite pin-up </i><br>
<i>&gt; girl, and eventually she became my (more or less voluntary) sex slave.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Does this qualify as a miracle?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No, I think it qualifies as anachronistic, adolescent,</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited by tradition,  sexist meme!  </i><br>
<p>
This is very, very bizarre.  I wish I could show this post to Leslie <br>
and watch the expression on her face.  The word "sexist" never entered <br>
her mind.  She would never use such language.  That was one thing <br>
we had in common. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To make it a "modern miracle": You found out not</i><br>
<i>&gt; only was she interested in pleasing you sexually, </i><br>
<i>&gt; she had a great mind, the same interests and </i><br>
<i>&gt; passions as you  and the emotional equipment to really</i><br>
<i>&gt; adore you?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; NOW THAT WOULD BE MIRACULOUS  </i><br>
<p>
I take my miracles when I can get them...  Leslie didn't have a great <br>
mind, but in her limited way she was a real artist, not a "political" artist.  <br>
(I'm using the past tense because she died last year, more or less the <br>
same way Jimi Hendrix died.) <br>
<p>
I basically agree with your conclusion, and I intend to find a woman <br>
who shares my interests and passions.  The amazing thing is that my <br>
interests &amp; passions, which used to be extremely esoteric, have <br>
suddenly become the trendiest thing on campus.  Another miracle.  <br>
