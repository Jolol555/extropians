E. Shaun Russell:<br>
<i>&gt;to mind the current debate on 'chain-letters' and radical and </i><br>
<i>&gt;semantical gender appropriation'. </i><br>
<p>
If you are characterizing my ideas as semantical, the entire point of my <br>
postings has been missed.  I'm proposing paths of real evolution, <br>
with or with out technological support, not quibbling over linguistics.  <br>
The mail dropping into my private box (very helpful feedback, thx) also <br>
indicates that these ideas appeal to both Extropians and transhumanists <br>
in general.<br>
<p>
If a clarification is necessary, please tell me where the <br>
misunderstanding lies, because as I develop my ideas I want to make them <br>
as clear as possible to people.<br>
