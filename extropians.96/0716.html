For those of you no on the transhuman mailing list, take a look at this! I<br>
sure hope it's a real finding and not some free energy/perpetual<br>
motion/evidence for UFOs bullshit.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;BREAKTHROUGH AS SCIENTISTS BEAT GRAVITY.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by Robert Matthews and Ian Sample</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;SCIENTISTS in Finland are about to reveal details of the world's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;first anti-gravity device. Measuring about 12in across, the device</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is said to reduce significantly the weight of anything suspended</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;over it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The claim -- which has been rigorously examined by scientists, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is due to appear in a physics journal next month -- could spark a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;technological revolution. By combatting gravity, the most ubiquitous</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;force in the universe, everything from transport to power generation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;could be transformed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The Sunday Telegraph has learned that Nasa, the American space</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;agency, is taking the claims seriously, and is funding research into</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;how the anti-gravity effect could be turned into a means of flight.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The researchers at the Tampere University of Technology in Finland,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;who discovered the effect, say it could form the heart of a new</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;power source, in which it is used to drive fluids past</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;electricity-generating turbines.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Other uses seem limited only by the imagination: Lifts in buildings</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;could be replaced by devices built into the ground. People wanting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to go up would simply activate the anti-gravity device -- making</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;themselves weightless -- and with a gentle push ascend to the floor</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they want.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Space-travel would bitcome routine, as all the expense and danger of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;rocket technology is geared towards combatting the Earth's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;gravitation pull. By using the devices to raise fluids against</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;gravity, and then conventional gravity to pull them back to ear th</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;against electricity-generating turbines, the devices could also</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;revolutionise power generation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;According to Dr Eugene Podkletnov, who led the research, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;discovery was accidental. It emerged during routine work on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;so-called "superconductivity", the ability of some materials to lose</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;their electrical resistance at very low temperatures. The team was</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;carrying out tests on a rapidly spinning disc of superconducting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ceramic suspended in the magnetic field of three electric coils, all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;enclosed in a low-temperature vessel called a cryostat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"One of my friends came in and he was smoking his pipe," Dr</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Podkletnov said. "He put some smoke over the cryostat and we saw</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that the smoke was going to the ceiling all the time. It was amazing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;-- we couldn't explain it." Tests showed a small drop in th e weight</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of objects placed over the device, as if it were shielding the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;object from the effects of gravity - an effect deemed impossible by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;most scientists. "We thought it might be a mistake," Dr Podkletnov</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;said, "but we have taken every precaution." Yet the bizarre effects</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;persisted. The team found that even the air pressure vertically</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;above the device dropped slightly, with the effect detectable</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;directly above the device on every floor of the laboratory. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;recent years, many so-called "anti-gravity" devices have been put</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;forward by both amateur and professional scientists, and all have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;been scorned by the establishment. What makes this latest claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;different is that it has survived intense scrutiny by sceptical,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;independent experts, and has been ac cepted for publication by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Journal of Physics-D: Applied Physics, published by Britain's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Institute of Physics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Even so, most scientists will not feel comfortable with the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;anti-gravity until other teams repeat the experiments. Some</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;scientists suspect the anti-gravity effect is a long-sought</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;side-effect of Einstein's general theory of relativity, by which s</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;pinning objects can distort gravity. Until now it was thought the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;effect would be far too small to measure in the laboratory. However,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Dr Ning Li, a senior research scientist at the University of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Alabama, said that the atoms inside superconductors may m agnify the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;effect enormously. Her research is funded by Nasa's Marshall Space</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Flight centre at Huntsville, Alabama, and Whitt Brantley, the chief</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of Advanced Concepts Office there, said: "We're taking a look at it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;because if we don't, we'll never know." The Finnish team is already</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;expanding its programme, to see if it can amplify the anti-gravity</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;effect. In its latest experiments, the team has measured a two per</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;cent drop in the weight of objects suspended over the device -and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;double that if one device is suspended over another. If the team can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;increase the effect substantially, the commercial implications are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;enormous.</i><br>
