<i>&gt;No, the tragic death of Drexler might even have the opposite effect by </i><br>
<i>&gt;creating media attention.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here is a more realistic scenario, based on an upcoming paper about</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario planning (this is the "House of Cards" scenario): </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;An international stock market crash occurs for one reason or another</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Earthquake in Tokyo, Bill Gates converts to Islam or a little computer in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ulan Bator gets a stupid idea); this upsets the world economy a lot, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;several influential banks or insurance companies crash or get into serious</i><br>
<i>&gt;trouble. This causes a feedback - for example, all insurance companies are</i><br>
<i>&gt;cross-insured, and if one goes down the others will feel the</i><br>
<i>&gt;repercussions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The economic chaos affects the national economies and currencies badly. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Many customers find their savings inaccessible or even gone, a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;companies are forced into layoffs. A new depression seems imminent, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt;has appeared much faster than anybody had planned for, and it is almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;impossible to do anything constructive against it (whether this is true or</i><br>
<i>&gt;not doesn't matter, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy). In developing</i><br>
<i>&gt;nations things turn very nasty, since foreign capital suddenly vanishes</i><br>
<i>&gt;together with the market of many export products (like coffee or cacao).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Things are not much better in the industrialized world, since there are a</i><br>
<i>&gt;large group of unemployed, suddenly poor people who have not enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;savings, will not get enough wellfare (since the government is busy having</i><br>
<i>&gt;to save the remaining banks, the currency and keep vital installations</i><br>
<i>&gt;running) and beside have lost all confidence in the official currencies. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As violence and poverty rise, many people band together into communities</i><br>
<i>&gt;for mutual protection and survival. This of course makes the state even</i><br>
<i>&gt;jumpier, and it has to prevent these communities from becoming too</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful, otherwise it will loose its remaining control - and of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;sending out the police and military consts valuable resources, which makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;the situation worse. And when things really start getting bad people</i><br>
<i>&gt;become even more desperate... </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The end result, when we played out this scenario, was a world dominated by</i><br>
<i>&gt;many more or less independent agrarian communities focused on staying</i><br>
<i>&gt;alive, most strongly defended or part of neo-feudal states. Long range</i><br>
<i>&gt;trade will probably return in the future, but it will take a long time. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mongolia suddenly looks like a developed country in this world - they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;good at horsemanship, independent and self-sufficient. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Meanwhile, advanced research and development is practically impossible</i><br>
<i>&gt;(ever tried to do genetic engineering without access to purified enzymes? </i><br>
<i>&gt;Or how do you rebuild the internet when electricity is a scarce</i><br>
<i>&gt;commodity?). Drexler and us are (if we are lucky) building generators or</i><br>
<i>&gt;tending the sick. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, this may not prevent the Singularity from appearing later, but it </i><br>
<i>&gt;will delay it considerably. You could of course make this scenario even </i><br>
<i>&gt;darker by assuming bioweapons or similar tricks, but a global market </i><br>
<i>&gt;crash can be bad enough. </i><br>
<p>
AHHH!! DON'T SAY THIS!! This is a horrible idea! What is the likelyhood of<br>
this occurring?<br>
