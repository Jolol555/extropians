You call it "slaving" . . . I call it "working".  Would you rather the "poor<br>
masses " be lazy and NOT work at all?  I see . . . you want them to just live<br>
off the work of the "rich".  But that could even be a problem:<br>
<p>
1.  Ok, start your own company and work for yourself.  You'll feel free and<br>
have dignity. That's what farmers do.  <br>
<p>
2.  What if you need help?  Hire people to help you.  Oh, I'm sorry you<br>
wouldn't want THAT!  Then you would be a slave master.  Right?  According to<br>
you anybody who helps someone else is a slave and the person being helped is<br>
a slave master.  Even if the "slave" gets paid and becomes rich.  <br>
<p>
This is what I'm getting out of your statements.  <br>
