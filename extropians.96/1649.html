<p>
Quite a good summary, by the way....<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Hara adds:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;Chalmers takes the notion that qualia, or our direct experience of</i><br>
<i>&gt; phenomena as a indication that consciousness is irreducible and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; explainable as part of other systems, such as materialism.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I had a hard time with this too.  In the Web essay, Chalmers says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; *but there is also* a subjective aspect.&gt; (My emphasis)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
In physics, we have descriptions of experience, often abstracted through<br>
the use of measuring instruments. Nobody knows what electromagnetism IS,<br>
however we have very accurate descriptions of how to measure and predict<br>
electromagnetic phenomena. <br>
<p>
The point here is that all science ultimately derives from experience,<br>
and of Chalmer's "easy questions" also ultimately derive from<br>
experience. This rapidly degenerates into tautology, because if<br>
conscious experience is irreducible, we get that all descriptions are<br>
irreducible.<br>
<p>
One can go another way, ie, all describable experience can be described<br>
reductively, and now the paradox is saying that the experiences<br>
themselves are irreducible and not so describable. So, tautology or<br>
contradiction....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've never been convinced that subjective experience is somehow distinct</i><br>
<i>&gt; from this "whir of information-processing", from the memory</i><br>
<i>&gt; storage/retrieval effort and the associated emotional markers we've used</i><br>
<i>&gt; to index those memories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yes, and Chalmers seems to forget that recovery of feelings and emotion<br>
and "sense of experiencing" are all memory based.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; words from Reilly Jones (9/28/96), "epistemological models we impose on</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever is actually going on in there, most likely just bits of stuff</i><br>
<i>&gt; bumping around in preferred directions", or do they have some utility?</i><br>
<p>
I think that in terms of social communication and acting together for<br>
mutual survival that these epistemological models have a lot of utility.<br>
The notions of "I", "myself", "my experience" and the "you" counterparts<br>
of same are at the essential core of our intercommunications.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can we usefully talk about patterns of thought being independent of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware/wetware on which they're processed (as Moravec has suggested?)</i><br>
<p>
No! Information always requires context, the hardware within which it is<br>
realised which can make use of same. However the illusion is pervasive<br>
and here's why:<br>
<p>
  Start with the notion of self awareness. This is a loop stating<br>
  that "I exist". Once this forms (around age 3) all experiences are<br>
  encoded with the presence of this loop. That is, "I was there" comes<br>
  with all remembered experiences. (There are some exceptions, in<br>
  which one's sense of self vanishes, but I don't recall anyone being<br>
  able to relate these experiences beyond a statement of ecstatic flow<br>
  at the time, and nothing in terms of actual content. Good sex, for<br>
  example.)<br>
<p>
  Then, in reflection, the question of "what is common to ALL of my<br>
  experiences" come up. Given the variety of experiences, including<br>
  dreams, etc., there is only one thing common to all experiences,<br>
  the sense of "I exist".<br>
<p>
  Therefore, the sense of "I exist" is experienced as the essence of all<br>
  personal experience. The sense of "Experience Exists" is the essence<br>
of<br>
  all remembered experiences inclusively. <br>
<p>
  At this point some striking resemblences to religious and mystical<br>
  experiences come forth:<br>
<p>
  - The sense of "I exist" is common to ALL personal experiences, ergo<br>
    Soul Exists - being another name for this common aspect to<br>
    all personal experiences.<br>
<p>
  - Ths sense of "Experience Exists" is common to all experience, ergo<br>
    Spirit Exists, God Exists - the Hindus call these Atman and<br>
    Brahman respectively.<br>
<p>
  Now, by some means, crank up the endorphin/hormonal/neuroexcitatory<br>
  system which indicates the subjective "This is REAL" to a really<br>
  high level, and Soul and Spirit become the Ultimate In Reality.<br>
  Combine this with one's desire to not die (for non cryonicists) and<br>
  the need for emotional assurance, and enjoy the rebirth of vitalism.<br>
  Socialize it and here's religion.<br>
<p>
  If Soul and Spirit are the Ultimate Reality, most of the spiritual<br>
  literature become obviously logical conclusions based on this<br>
assumption.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are our subjective experiences objective at some level as David Musick</i><br>
<i>&gt; has suggested (9/27/96)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Once I have the upload or neuro-interface, the bit patterns which<br>
represent these experiences can now be moved out of my skull into other<br>
media, and loaded into other's minds. (I gloss over the details, just<br>
as  nsnotechnologists do....) At the present moment, the various media<br>
language, video, etc) do communicate some of this. The best<br>
entertainment and arts do so quite well, sans verification. <br>
<p>
If I have a sensor for each neuron (possibly only when uploaded) then my<br>
state can be captured and examined at leisure. This data is data, just<br>
as any objective scientific data is objective. So, yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hara Ra trails off with:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;[Chalmers] discussion of quantum mechanics is also interesting, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular his view toward Emmet's ideas which are often misstated as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "many worlds" interpretation of QM.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please, tell us more!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
OK...<br>
 <br>
Chalmers points out that the main problem with Quantum Mechanics is the<br>
interpretation of events. The wave functions describe the liklihood of<br>
events with great precision (the best known in some cases) but do not<br>
state what happens when an Event is noticed. Yet we experience Events,<br>
therefore our experience is somehow beyond QM...<br>
<p>
I won't get into how Chalmers sees Emmet. However I will describe an<br>
alternative point of view:<br>
<p>
  If we view the universe as a kind of giant Feynman diagram, (and<br>
  ignore the dilemmas of renormalization and virtual particles) and<br>
  assume that there are a finite number of particles, and a finite<br>
  number of possible interactions, then the state of the universe can<br>
  be described as an integer. (Said integer can be described as a list<br>
  of properties concatenated into a string of digits. (shades of Godel!)<br>
  Each property set describes a single particle. Each particle can be<br>
  described reasonable concisely, by a few thousand bits (particle<br>
quantum<br>
  state, position, momentum)<br>
<p>
  Each quantum Event converts one of the numbers into another. Again<br>
  taking a leaf from Godel, said conversions consist of a series of<br>
  elementary arithmetic operations applied to one of these numbers.<br>
  (BTW, not all possible integers represent possible states of the<br>
  universe...) All QM rules of transition can be described as series<br>
  of elementary arithmetic operations. (This is easily envisioned by<br>
  creating short algorithms for such things as:<br>
<p>
  - derive the substring for an individual particle<br>
  - convert interacting particle substrings into other<br>
    particle substrings by QM rules<br>
  - replace the original particle substrings with the<br>
    new substrings )<br>
<p>
  Now, consider the set of all integers. Some of these will represent<br>
  Universe State Strings (USS's). By the rules of QM, each USS can be<br>
  converted to another USS. If we confine ourselves to one Feynman<br>
  interaction per conversion, then each USS can convert to a finite<br>
  number of other USS's, but no USS can convert in a single interaction<br>
  into all of the other USS's. One way to visualise this is to imagine<br>
  a line or grid of dots representing the integers (like a bingo card<br>
  at the back of a trade magazine). The integers which represent<br>
  possible USS's are marked in some way (say red dots). Each red dot<br>
  has lines running to other USS's, each line representing an allowed<br>
  QM interaction. Note that each red dot also has INCOMING lines,<br>
  representing the set of possible ancestor USS's.<br>
<p>
  Penrose describes some of this in his book the "Emperor's New Mind".<br>
	<br>
  One point to notice here is that every state of the Universe comes<br>
from<br>
  a large and finite number of possible past states, that there is NO<br>
  single past.<br>
<p>
  Another point to notice is that preserving physical memory implies<br>
that<br>
  some of the particle states are not changed, which limits the number<br>
  of possible memory preserving transformations. Ie, we come from many<br>
  possible pasts and it is not possible to know which ones. Memory<br>
limits<br>
  the possibilities both ways. This creates outrageous conclusions,<br>
  which I use in my shamanic work:<br>
<p>
    Miracles require absolute forgetfulness.<br>
<p>
  and,<br>
<p>
    Time is based entirely on memory.<br>
<p>
  A look at chaos theory brings up some conjectures re the set of all<br>
  USS's:<br>
<p>
  - What do the attractors look like?<br>
  - Black Holes are powerful attractors, and Hawking is<br>
    wrong; Black Holes do absolutely destroy<br>
    information.<br>
  - Are there completely connected and independent networks<br>
    of USS's?? Ie, many separated universes which have<br>
    no way to transform into one another?<br>
<p>
And, to wrap this bit up, since consciousness IMHO is based on the self<br>
remberance of experience, only a tiny subset of connected USS's will<br>
have the property of consciousness....<br>
<p>
Enjoy....<br>
