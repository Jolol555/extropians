but I must say I found this particular post far more pleasant than the last one:<br>
thanks, Reilly.&gt;<br>
<p>
Your welcome.  Mutual reciprocity seems to work just fine.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;Your formation of this opinion started from the premise that I thought<br>
contradictory things could happen in the same place at the same time. I don't.<br>
So that ain't my worldview. Promise.&gt;<br>
<p>
OK.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;My value judgements decide what I tolerate and what I do not tolerate.&gt;<br>
<p>
And you don't want to "try and rationalize my system of morality and ethics at<br>
this point."  OK.<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;I'd rather not be destroyed _and_ honour diversity. Mind you, sometimes<br>
that's a difficult fight!&gt;<br>
<p>
In this fight, does desiring being destroyed ever prevail over honoring<br>
diversity?  Even once?<br>
<p>
SM: &lt;When Brown first observed pollen motion there was no theory at all behind<br>
it....  You don't need a theory to observe, and you don't need a theory to<br>
record your observations.&gt;<br>
<p>
How did Brown recognize pollen without a theory?  Or recognize motion without a<br>
theory?  If you want to pursue this line after you take a gander at the source I<br>
provided, I'd be happy to.  But I'm not going to plunge into interminable<br>
details for now.<br>
<p>
My, my, we're getting along like proper ladies and gentlemen all of sudden.  &lt;g&gt;<br>

<p>
Ugh...  Those with the best weapons and the will to use them, end up winning<br>
these kind of popularity contests.  No thank you.  I will assume that nothing<br>
you have to say is true, since I don't give a rip about popularity contests.<br>
