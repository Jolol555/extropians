Ian,<br>
<p>
Remember that your philosophy of holistic unity is in your own head, and is <br>
not necessarily true about the world outside your head; the world which is <br>
providing information to your senses is forever beyond your direct reach (you <br>
don't see the world; you see the *effect* the world has on you).  Your <br>
philosophy may make a great deal of logical sense to you, but that doesn't <br>
mean that the real world categorizes things the way you do.  Your entire <br>
notion of identity is entirely fictional.  Yes, it appeals to you, but that is <br>
no reason to suppose that reality actually organizes itself that way.  Your <br>
philosophical world is an invented one, a sort of virtual world, and just <br>
because something makes sense in that world, such as the idea that every part <br>
is identical to the whole universe, doesn't mean that it is an actual feature <br>
of the real world.  Yes, granted certain premises and assumptions about how to <br>
percieve things and categorize them, your idea is perfectly correct, but I <br>
don't think that the world actually organizes itself according to your <br>
personal philosophy, nor do I think that your personal philosophy of holistic <br>
unity is likely to be a feature of the real world.  And even if it was, I <br>
don't see what value this way of looking at thing actually has.  Does it help <br>
us understand the way our world works at all?  Can it help us understand <br>
chemical reactions?  Can it help us build better technologies?  Or is it <br>
simply a mental game with no external relevance?<br>
