OK, I'll take a courageous stab at the purpose-of-life questions.<br>

I think the U.S. founding fathers had it right: the individual pursuit of<br>
happiness.  There may be disagreement over what constitutes happiness, but<br>
that doesn't matter.  What people really want is the *freedom* to pursue<br>
it.  Since technology increases human freedom, technological progress is<br>
one of the basic "goods" in life.<br>
<p>
The problem occurs when one person believes their freedom is maximized by<br>
interfering with another person's freedom.  At root, I believe this is due<br>
to a lack of understanding of what freedom is.  If we want other people not<br>
to interfere with *our* freedom, we must embrace a common, objective<br>
morality.  From there, we can cooperatively achieve technological progress,<br>
the benefits of which are reaped by individuals.<br>

Freedom, per above.<br>
