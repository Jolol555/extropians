I don't have any brilliant ideas about this in the short-term, but it's<br>
starting to look pretty obvious to me that sooner or later we are going to<br>
have a recognized profession of credential-creators. People whose ability<br>
to judge work within a given field is fully recognized by practitioners of<br>
that field and is generally recognized by people outside that field who<br>
need to consume information produced by workers in that field.<br>
<p>
This role has traditionally been played by institutions (schools, colleges,<br>
journals, etc.) But as specialization accelerates, fields are coming into<br>
existence for which there are only a few people capable of judging work<br>
done in that field (over and above just *doing* work in that field). People<br>
who work in these specialties have to figure out who these "de facto"<br>
credential grantors are as their work proceeds... unless they feel no need<br>
whatsoever for external validation of the quality of their own intellectual<br>
work. There are lots of fields of work proceeding as we speak for which no<br>
journal exists. They are managing to set their own standards somehow.<br>
Eventually the practices they are evolving will develop into full-fledged<br>
institutions.<br>
<p>
Maybe someday there will be a few loosely recognized "professional<br>
organizations" for the profession of credential-granting. The best analogy<br>
I can think of for this future development that I'm thinking about is the<br>
voluntary accrediting institutions that accredit schools in the United<br>
States. It would be the same kind of thing, only they'd be accrediting<br>
individual specialists, who would in turn endorse the work of people<br>
working in that particular field. It's these endorsements by individual<br>
credential-creators (probably with their digital signature) that you'd put<br>
on your vita. Endorsement would probably be for specific pieces of work<br>
done over specific periods of time, not carte-blanche endorsements of the<br>
researcher as a person.<br>
<p>
The potentials for abuse are stupendous. Here is a field ripe for those who<br>
are interested in designing alternative institutions. As far as I can tell,<br>
it'll be a matter of getting the design of the protocols right and leaving<br>
room for the future improvement of those protocols. What do you think,<br>
Robin? You've got a lot more expertise in this matter than I do.<br>
<p>
(It's pretty obvious that my thinking on this is heavily influenced by the<br>
"web of trust" ideas in the PGP documentation and related texts. But I'd<br>
expect that of most of the other people on this list, even now.)<br>
