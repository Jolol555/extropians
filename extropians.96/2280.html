If you've ever wanted to induce lucid dreaming or "astral projection"<br>
I give "my" proven recipe below:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I myself have</i><br>
<i>&gt; had dreams where I had sets of memories in the dream only to wakeup and</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize they were entirely false. Dreams also add to chaos and confusion</i><br>
<i>&gt; when you try to remember events in your past which were actually dreams and</i><br>
<i>&gt; never actually occurred. I have had dreams merge with my real memory upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; waking up. Perhaps this is some sort of sleep disorder? I've had some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those spontaneously prefabricated dream memories grafted into my real</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory bank and thus create confusion. One example is I've woken up and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought to myself, "Hey I just dreamed a continuation of a dream I'd had</i><br>
<i>&gt; before" when I hadn't. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: I too have had that perception, of being in a dreamscape that<br>
I've been in in a former dream: redreaming. It's not occurred to me <br>
that this might also be an illusion. I seem to recall upon waking <br>
that they did mesh with true former dreams. "True Dreams" there's <br>
a curiosity. Notice that there is no inverse word for "dreaming," <br>
there's waking, but somehow that doesn't cut it.<br>
<p>
I think if the brain fabricated a dreamscape once, it's probable <br>
that it keeps this dreamscape "on file" and may open that file <br>
again. In this case, redreaming may not be an illusion.<br>
<p>
Another very interesting dream observation is that in your dreams,<br>
your mind operates as if other than you. For example: you don't<br>
know what is in the other dream room, but your mind does, and<br>
your mind someone subordinates "you" to a lower order of info <br>
access. This is a radical measure of a hierarchical structure <br>
of self, forcing the question: Who is this "me" ?  It also<br>
measures the fact that one can "hack" one's way into the knowledge<br>
of the fact that my mind is larger than this thing I call "me,"<br>
by simple deductive logic. <br>
<p>
However, at the moment I can't think of examples where I've witnessed <br>
this in dreams, but I have many times realized that knowledge was <br>
"withheld" from me that had to have existed elsewhere, which I eventually<br>
discovered in the dream. The mind is a miracle, and dreams are such <br>
a powerful example of the miracle of the mind. That's what makes <br>
lucid-dream access such an important thing for the investigator. <br>
The next best thing to psychotropic agents, which we must not have <br>
or big people with big clubs start hitting real hard.. ouch, me no <br>
like. Banish the big stick. Curse the big stick !!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; I_really wish_ I could have more lucid dreams! I only have them when</i><br>
<i> &gt; I'm sick with a cold or flu and thats even rare. </i><br>
<p>
IAN: Interesting. I never had lucid dreams until I started doing <br>
special meditations designed to invoke "astral projection." Sure enough,<br>
they worked, however, I've generally concluded that I don't travel<br>
further than the inside of my skull. |^(  I want a refund on that book !!<br>
<p>
There are sever astral travel inducing meditations. The one that did<br>
the trick for me was an ancient kabbalistic meditation, from some<br>
book on "Secrets of High Magic." I'd recommend doing any variety<br>
of meditation, simply to induce an alpha-to-delta wave-state,<br>
prior to going to sleep. Then, and this is the key, lay on<br>
your back and just allow yourself to drift off, but begin <br>
to imagine that your rising up out of your bed, even floating<br>
upwards toward the ceiling. On of the first times I "got out"<br>
I found myself gently bouncing off the ceiling. It's amazing that <br>
astral project seems just like what it claims to be. <br>
<p>
A key point is to imagine yourself moving in your body as you <br>
rest motionless on your back. Not necessarily only imagining <br>
getting up out of your bed. This seems to allow a smooth transition <br>
from  waking--&gt;subdreaming--&gt;dreaming  through which the conscious <br>
"self" is preserved. That alone is some kind of miracle.<br>
<p>
Every time I "project" upon falling to sleep, I get up out of my bed <br>
in another ghostly body. I can fly and sit lotus style above the ground <br>
and move across space. It's way fun, but frightening at first. When <br>
I travel around, I'm in my neighborhood but things are real different. <br>
Spooky but I'm not spooked. It's like literally walking in your mind. <br>
<p>
However, I usually try to avoid projecting, in fact, there was a time <br>
when I'd tell myself, "I will go to sleep without remaining conscious."<br>
This is because the astral trip is usually short-lived, and often<br>
results in ones waking up a few minutes later, at least for me,<br>
and when sleep is the objective, this can be a hassle. It seems<br>
that once the conscious self enters the dreamscape, it can't <br>
get "turned off" in the dreamscape, so it is thrown out.<br>
Lot's of heavy stuff here for neuro-investigation.<br>
<p>
Brain scans of a normal sleep induction and then of a lucid <br>
dream induction should reveal what areas of the brain cause<br>
"consciousness" to be, by the simple fact that in the first<br>
case they turn off, but in the second case they stay on.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; Although usually any dreams of</i><br>
<i> &gt; mine are _so bizarre_ to be incomprehensible to descramble and discover</i><br>
<i> &gt; their psychological meaning. Also have you noticed that whenever you see</i><br>
<i> &gt; printed words in a dream every time you look away and look back they say</i><br>
<i> &gt; something different? Also through studying computer graphics and virtual</i><br>
<i> &gt; reality and watching such computer graphics videos such as "Beyond The</i><br>
<i> &gt; Mind's Eye" my dreams, when I _do_ have them are _extremely_ vivid with</i><br>
<i> &gt; rotating camera angles, panning, etc, etc.</i><br>
<p>
IAN: The mind learns. Have you ever heard if born-blind people dream?<br>
I wonder how much mental imagery is "encoded."<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; I'll write something down on this dreamland pad of paper, </i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; hay, the letters I just wrote are changing before my eyes</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Exactly! What causes this phenomenon?</i><br>
<p>
IAN: ???  It seems to be an ideal example of the dreaming mind,<br>
that it can't keep things consistent. It's perhaps the clearest<br>
distinction between the waking state and the dreaming state.<br>
<p>
BTW, I have had dream experiences that turned out to mesh virtually <br>
100% with waking state events that came to pass after the dream,<br>
where the dream was recalled prior to the events which unfolded<br>
outside my control, such that it could not be that I somehow<br>
cause those events to simulate my dreams. The force of these<br>
experiences prevents me from rejecting the possibility <br>
that there could be some kind of precognition, and<br>
that perhaps astral projection is not 100% fantasy. <br>
