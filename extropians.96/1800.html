What follows is part of a post from Forrest Bishop that arrived this <br>
morning.  I am reproducing it exactly as it appears (without the usual &gt; <br>
since that would disturb the format):  <br>
<p>
******<br>
<p>
blast wave that encircles the core, similar to the White Dwarf scenario. The <br>
res<br>
ulting<br>
sudden energy release would then blow off the outer layers of the Sun, like a <br>
no<br>
va.<br>
One method of providing this trigger is to fire an object at the Sun, that is la<br>
rge enough<br>
and fast enough to penetrate the outer layers without burning up, and deposit <br>
it<br>
s energy in<br>
the pre-critical region.<br>
 <br>
The case of a supernova chain reaction at the core of the Milky Way Galaxy <br>
has b<br>
een studied<br>
in some detail, and may have already occured a number of times. There is <br>
apparen<br>
tly a big<br>
(4 million+ Solar mass) Black Hole at the galactic core that occasionaly <br>
gulps d<br>
own a<br>
stray star or two. The resulting fireworks may have provided the energy <br>
<p>
******<br>
<p>
Sometimes this stuff goes on for pages.  The same thing happens with <br>
posts from other people, such as Davin C. Enigl and David Musick.  <br>
Narrower margins might fix this problem.  (Of course I have probably <br>
been on Forrest's kill list since last April, so he won't get this message.     <br>
Oh well... ) <br>
