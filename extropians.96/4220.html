For the Alcubierre "warp drive", you need to create a "negative energy<br>
density" behind the ship (essentially like anti-gravity, to "push" the<br>
ship from behind). Alcubierre knew of no possible way to do this.<br>
<p>
But there is a way- the "Casimir effect" - which may help solve this<br>
problem. Surely someone told Alcubierre, because I think their<br>
papers came out around the same time.<br>

<p>
The Casimir Effect is a weird quantum mechanical effect that results<br>
in a negative energy. It is completely theoretical at this point, I<br>
don't think that it has been verified in the lab.<br>
<p>
(No, I had never heard of the Casimir Effect before a physics grad<br>
student friend told me about it last week.)<br>
