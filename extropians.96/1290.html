Hi folks<br>
<p>
...hitting both lists here, hope that's not impolite...  (adrift in the<br>
datasea...) (aargh)<br>
<p>
The debate between Lyle and other more optimistic nanoists seems to me to<br>
depend on the question of `tacit knowledge', evolutionarily-acquired tricks<br>
for dealing with the world - life regarded as GAs at the end of a three<br>
billion year planet-sized run.  How are these little buggers supposed to be<br>
programmed to do their job of building a starship in the back-yard pool?<br>
It's no good pointing to mitochondria and ribosomes and crying `existence<br>
proof!', unless you can specify or emulate all the subtle algorithms they<br>
encode.  And even assuming a Very Big Smart AI Thing which isn't yet<br>
autonomous to number-crunch the specs for yr starship, how is this template<br>
vectored out to the trillions of nano fabricators doing the back-stroke in<br>
the milky pool of goop?  Radio?  Infra-red?  Batons (or quipu, as the Incas<br>
would have done) handed physically back and forth? Is there a precise<br>
cascade of fabricators, and chemo-gradients, and all that standard<br>
make-a-meat-body stuff?  (Not in a goop pool, I'd have thought.)<br>
<p>
Probably all this is explained in NANOSYSTEMS, but shamefully my university<br>
library doesn't have a copy... nor does my local academic book store, yet.<br>
<p>
Best, Damien<br>
