Yes, but what about the ecological consequences? Algae blooms are <br>
complicated things, and influence a lot of other systems. I think we have <br>
to develop a new technology, ecoengineering, to deal with deliberate <br>
modifications of ecology, climate and other aspects of the environment. <br>
Maybe we could start algae blooms in the tropical "desert" seas, where <br>
normally very little life lives? <br>

<p>
Well, if you lived on Cuba you would probably think it was reasonable. <br>
Besides, I got the impression the results were rather inconclusive.<br>
<p>
My guess is that it is easier to influence systems with no strong <br>
positive feedback loops, especially chaotic ones. Hurricanes seem to be <br>
rather stable structures. Of course, if we can set up our own feedback <br>
loops (as with algae blooms), then we can get interesting abilities.<br>
