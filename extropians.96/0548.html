QUAENOS' PILLAR<br>
<p>
<p>
I.)		THE RIGHT DEGREE<br>
<p>
The gods have come to cure the earth<br>
Cross galaxies to assess its worth<br>
And I am one<br>
A god on our terrain<br>
To find out what's in store and what shall ever reign<br>
<p>
The presence of an avatar<br>
The embassy of tribunal afar<br>
To rule the world<br>
Misplace its trust<br>
Restore all human goals to just<br>
<p>
Flesh and blood for almighty power<br>
Penance drives the darkest hour<br>
Seduction for a planet's land<br>
With a hapless mortal's helping hand<br>
Fearing not the greater good<br>
Every ion understood<br>
Known to be the impelling force<br>
The core of knowledge, universe's source<br>
<p>
<p>
II.)		THE HISTORY OF QUAENOS<br>
<p>
Quaenos was a madman from Jupiter's days of yore<br>
He feared the tendency to do what had already been done before<br>
So he built himself a transport and went to Ganymede<br>
A desolate moon with freedom was the place where Quaenos stayed<br>
<p>
On the surface of the moon he found a mineral not known prior<br>
A blackish rock that when touched with oxygen burst into red fire<br>
He observed this sight with shaky breath and could hardly comprehend<br>
That Jupiter was negligent to what was beyond their world's end<br>
<p>
To go beyond --his sole desire<br>
Manifest this sanguine fire<br>
Make use of what he did not know<br>
A glory which Quaenos did bestow<br>
<p>
All on his own did Quaenos decide to gain universal acclaim<br>
To create a monumental pillar of this new material was his aim<br>
Mad as he was -unpredictable- he had a gift for art<br>
So he set himself a life long goal -construction straight from the heart<br>
<p>
With a crazed mind and a determined will, Quaenos achieved his goal<br>
Pious and content and wanting to live though time had taken its toll<br>
Quaenos' Pillar arose from Ganymede's youthful, rocky face<br>
And when touched with oxygen its glow illuminated the surrounding space<br>
<p>
The folk of Jupiter and planets around beheld this awesome sight<br>
Even the stars noticed Quaenos' Pillar and its glowing crimson light<br>
In the eyes of all the beholders of the universe none would show any praise<br>
To this man, this prophet, this heretic who had forgone their orthodox ways<br>
<p>
Flesh and blood for almighty power<br>
Penance drives the darkest hour<br>
Seduction for a planet's land<br>
With a hapless mortal's helping hand<br>
Fearing not the greater good<br>
Every ion understood<br>
Known to be the impelling force<br>
The core of knowledge, universe's source<br>
<p>
<p>
III.)		QUAENOS' ARCHETYPE<br>
<p>
While the attention of the universe lay upon the Pillar's light<br>
The outlook of the beholders was of jealousy and spite<br>
They all wished they had the will to harvest creativity<br>
But they couldn't understand that they first had to be free<br>
<p>
In the reddish haze of space around Quaenos' pride and joy<br>
There was a small planet where I grew up as a boy<br>
While others were trying to find ways to make the bright light dim<br>
I was trying to find a way to be just like him<br>
<p>
To go beyond --my sole desire<br>
Understand this meaningful pyre<br>
To learn more and to know<br>
That it wasn't some peccadillo<br>
<p>
Growing up wasn't easy in this horrid society<br>
Schools programmed most students but did not program me<br>
But with my wisdom and my knowledge I got through it alright<br>
Oblivious to my scholars, my goal focused my sight<br>
<p>
Trying to break away but not finding the means<br>
Striving for a better way to achieve my dreams<br>
Knowing the structured world wasn't quite what it seemed<br>
I had to get away from the atrocity of the deemed<br>
<p>
<p>
IV.)		ELUDING THE CONVENTION<br>
<p>
There must be something beyond the rim of this sphere<br>
I see opportunities where everyone else sees fear<br>
The need for something more shouldn't set me apart<br>
But I'm different --I have no boundaries on my yearning heart<br>
I've been told to sacrifice my pursuits for the greater good<br>
Told to forfeit freedom --it has never been understood<br>
Do they realize their pleadings just lead to my dissension?<br>
Giving me the drive to elude the convention<br>
<p>
It is possible that there is truth to fate and destiny<br>
If so, then maybe freedom will be the fate for me<br>
To surpass each and every limit with no regret or guilt<br>
Would shine more brightly to me than the Pillar Quaenos built<br>
<p>
Cradled in the arms of my overbearing society<br>
Expected to oblige, to have some sense of 'atoned piety'<br>
While each iota of my being seeks to find a way out<br>
Experience has given me a few reasons to doubt...<br>
<p>
<p>
V.)		THE HISTORY OF MANKIND<br>
<p>
Mankind has been a burden since the species has begun<br>
When progress reared its head most men would turn their tail and run<br>
In the tens of thousands of years this bipedal race has been alive<br>
There have been few attempts to go beyond this world --to strive<br>
<p>
In the time of man's existence the farthest outward has been the moon<br>
And if the race wants to carry on they had better go further soon<br>
Mankind has been so ignorant throughout their history<br>
Will they remain this way and perish? that is a current mystery<br>
<p>
The parallel race on Jupiter had progressed little more<br>
Though they had not gone beyond, they knew enough not to ignore<br>
But with progress comes liability, reliability no-one had<br>
And the lack of responsible societies is what make the races seem sad<br>
<p>
And while my race was doomed to their ignorance<br>
And Quaenos' race by their indifference<br>
Both societies are destined to go without<br>
But I --I'm destined to get out<br>
<p>
Flesh and blood for almighty power<br>
Penance drives the darkest hour<br>
All I am is in me<br>
And I shall be free<br>
<p>
<p>
VI.)		THE WAY<br>
<p>
I hid my views from the people outside<br>
So no-one knew my incentive<br>
Detached from the world --a motive to hide<br>
I had to get inventive<br>
<p>
Using systematic schools around me<br>
I learned how to build a spacecraft<br>
And if anybody knew what I was trying to do<br>
That person would have thought me quite daft<br>
<p>
Although it took a lot of time and money<br>
My desire was almost fulfilled<br>
For now I had the means to go beyond this world<br>
And do what I have always willed<br>
<p>
To go beyond --my sole desire<br>
Leave the Earth stuck in its mire<br>
To learn more and to know<br>
That there's always farther to go<br>
To collapse society<br>
Show all races they can be free<br>
If they can pass convention's hem<br>
They can see that they are God, and God is them<br>
Seduction for a planet's land<br>
With a hapless mortal's helping hand<br>
Teach them to see<br>
That they are free<br>
<p>
And as I launched away from earth I gave a wave goodbye<br>
To a world that's full of prayers to a conventional lie<br>
Pointed straight for Ganymede my spacecraft soared beyond<br>
On a quest for stellar righteousness --a goal as my only bond<br>
<p>
I cast my thoughts to Quaenos as I pass the red body of Mars<br>
I wonder what life would be like to be recognized by the stars<br>
To transgress a moral boundary, to discover things none knew<br>
Is an easy enough task but no-one ever knows just what to do<br>
<p>
Io's steady revolutions transfix me in a thought<br>
That I may be the only one pursuing goals I had always sought<br>
In a universe of apparent truths I may be the only one who understands<br>
That the universe needs no society to use it to run their petty errands<br>
<p>
Fearing not the greater good<br>
Every ion understood<br>
I felt an eerie hesitation<br>
As I reached my destination<br>
<p>
<p>
VII.)		DETRACTING PROGRESS<br>
<p>
As I reached the rocky surface of Jupiter's brightest moon<br>
The Pillar light was shining --a madman's eternal boon<br>
And as I landed my precious shuttle a sight astonished me<br>
Engraved within the Pillar a sign said "PEOPLE, YOU ARE FREE"<br>
<p>
And at the base of the colossal landmass the creator's carcass lay<br>
With a look of peace upon his face at a goal not gone astray<br>
With his life there had come a meaning, a fulfillment of intent<br>
And silently I thanked him for his inspiration and his talent<br>
<p>
To go beyond --his sole desire<br>
Manifest this sanguine fire<br>
Make use of what he did not know<br>
A glory which Quaenos did bestow<br>
<p>
In life he was just like Gulliver --bound to a fool's ideal<br>
But he broke their bonds and got past their morals, did something that was real<br>
Lived out his dreams away from his kind, built a pillar of rock<br>
And lit an intergalactic fire that sparked the universe to talk<br>
<p>
But meanwhile down on Jupiter, the races were circling around<br>
Doing what they had always done content with being bound<br>
Practicing detracting progress --regression their sole trait<br>
Letting others make decisions while leaving life all up to fate<br>
<p>
It's time for change to come around<br>
Alleviate the need for bound<br>
And I will start<br>
Show people they can choose<br>
The ones who see free will can win, the rest shall always lose<br>
<p>
<p>
VIII.)	THE GUISE OF AN EAGLE<br>
<p>
Some say the end is near<br>
And cower from the world in fear<br>
Cast their eyes away from will<br>
Let their minds be taken ill<br>
Some walk away from goals<br>
And train themselves that they have no souls<br>
Not follow their hearts desire<br>
Or fan their passion's fire<br>
<p>
But their destiny lies in them<br>
The tree of fortune's stem<br>
<p>
And for those I arrive<br>
To show otherwise<br>
To teach and to learn<br>
Singular concern<br>
Known to be the impelling force<br>
The core of knowledge, universe's source<br>
Lies in all who want the chance<br>
To rid themselves of penance<br>
<p>
I the eagle from afar<br>
The second vacant star<br>
To capture before demise<br>
The potential gods --the wise<br>
<p>
Ready to face the peasants of this largest planet's tract<br>
Try to replace convention with reason and with fact<br>
Show their world that disposition is good to have achieved<br>
That society is entropy and they were all deceived<br>
<p>
And as I climb into my spacecraft I have a semblance of hope<br>
To prove to this new people that there's a better way to cope<br>
And with the Pillar light of freedom giving me the drive<br>
I feel more than ever satisfaction to be alive<br>
<p>
Flesh and blood for almighty power<br>
Penance drives the darkest hour<br>
Seduction for a planet's land<br>
With a hapless mortal's helping hand<br>
Fearing not the greater good<br>
Every ion understood<br>
Known to be the impelling force<br>
The core of knowledge, universe's source<br>
<p>
<p>
IX.)		THE ENTROPIC HOUR<br>
<p>
My arrival was blasphemy in this strictly governed land<br>
I was told I was immoral before I had a chance to stand<br>
Their progress was ordained in a steady backward crawl<br>
The couldn't overcome the simple fact that they were walking into a wall<br>
<p>
Freedom was not an option throughout Jupiter's colonies<br>
With religious fears and programmed thoughts and corrupt societies<br>
And the harder I tried to show them that only they can control their fate<br>
Their uneasy tolerance of my purposes suddenly turned to hate<br>
<p>
And so rejected I turned to space<br>
And saw the Pillar's light<br>
And instantly it dawned on me<br>
That all would turn out alright<br>
<p>
The entropic hour for this world has come<br>
Like a million others in space<br>
But if I see things so much clearer than some<br>
There may be hope for every race<br>
<p>
If I have followed Quaenos' pursuit of a goal<br>
Maybe someone shall follow me<br>
And then I will have played my role<br>
In universal history<br>
<p>
<p>
X.)		EVER<br>
<p>
The gods have come to cure the earth<br>
Cross galaxies to assess its worth<br>
And I am one<br>
A god who shall ordain<br>
To know what is in store and what shall ever reign<br>
<p>
The presence of an avatar<br>
The embassy of tribunal afar<br>
To rule all worlds<br>
Misplace their trust<br>
Restore all races goals to just<br>
<p>
Flesh and blood for almighty power<br>
Penance drives the darkest hour<br>
Seduction for a planet's land<br>
With a hapless mortal's helping hand<br>
Fearing not the greater good<br>
Every ion understood<br>
Known to be the impelling force<br>
The core of knowledge, universe's source<br>
<p>
And as the universal carrion<br>
Ambles towards 'never'<br>
Quaenos' Pillar's light shines on<br>
Forever and ever...<br>
<p>
