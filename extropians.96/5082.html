<i>&gt;Considering that I've been involved in actively working to get a number</i><br>
<i>&gt;of freinds and colleagues in Seattle sober, I would be the last person</i><br>
<i>&gt;to say to hell with them.</i><br>
<p>
Good for you!  How is it going?  What would you say are the things you've<br>
tried that work best?  Which work least well?  How well do the people<br>
involved know you, and do you think your techniques would work on people<br>
that knew you less well or not at all?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But also because of my experience, I can tell</i><br>
<i>&gt;you that substance abuse is merely a symptom of other problems,</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically having to do with childhood trauma.</i><br>
<p>
Mostly I'm suggesting that framing them as "screwed up", as in<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If they weren't screwed up to begin with,</i><br>
<i>&gt;substance abuse would not be a problem.</i><br>
<p>
may be an obstacle to what you're trying to do.  In my experience,<br>
people detect such attitudes and get defensive.  Note that I ascribe<br>
to the idea that our language affects our thoughts (and vice-versa);<br>
I suppose it's one of the reasons I'm not big on sarcasm.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
