          Sarah Marr:<br>
          You point out that it would be very difficult to wash away <br>
          the overtones of contempt from the word "stupid" by usage <br>
          alone, unless people who considered themselves stupid <br>
          proudly used it to describe themselves. Perhaps there is <br>
          more room for optimism as regards that _sentence_ which <br>
          ascribed this property to a certain race? An educator might <br>
          hope that many people could eventually be brought to grasp <br>
          the distinction between the first sentence example ("Blacks <br>
          are...") and the second sentence example ("I hate those <br>
          bloody...") in my original posting.<br>
