<p>
The advanced technology I had in mind wasn't weapons; I agree that you<br>
can hire out self-defense.  The technology I had in mind was various<br>
ways to enhance productivity of a given set of natural resources.  As<br>
you state above, making copies is one example.  Changing how<br>
motivation works is another example that might defeat the pleasure<br>
seeker more directly by making the pleasure seeker seek something<br>
else.<br>
<p>
If your personal productivity lags far enough behind the productivity<br>
of the intruders, then the costs of self-defense might go up faster<br>
than you can afford.  Of course, the technology for self-defense would<br>
be advancing too, which might push it down.  I do not know the<br>
ultimate outcome.  <br>
<p>
It is said that life expands to fill the available niches.  If the<br>
pleasure seeker is far enough behind, then in comparison with the<br>
competition he will start to look like a niche rather than like life.<br>
Technology might indefinitely forestall the natural outcome, or it<br>
might exacerbate it.  I do not know.<br>
