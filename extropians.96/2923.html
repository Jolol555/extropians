...........Today is Yesterday's Tommorrow.......<br>
<p>
Look here young man an' listen, <br>
You're only ninety one.<br>
You'll never see what I've seen<br>
Or done what I have done.<br>
<p>
There used to be this pastime<br>
that everyone called  "work,"<br>
The government was king of all, <br>
- your leader was a jerk.<br>
<p>
We always had to eat,<br>
we always had to sleep,<br>
the flesh went fast,<br>
the times were grim.<br>
Your time you couldn't keep!<br>
<p>
They made us deal is cash,<br>
this thing that makes no sense.<br>
The cars could even crash...<br>
and taxes were intense.<br>
<p>
No ships went out in space,<br>
to earth mankind was bound!<br>
You had to keep your race<br>
Exactly as 'twas found<br>
<p>
Your sex was even given<br>
by some genetic code!<br>
Can you imigine livin'<br>
in one consistant mode?<br>
<p>
So if I hear you bitching <br>
how slow the pilot flies<br>
or someone's missed your birthmas<br>
Or gave your mistress eyes.<br>
<p>
Ask if you thought before you talked! <br>
You might remember this:<br>
that sometime back<br>
they stopped the lack,<br>
And extropy was grokked.<br>
<p>
You may feel cold<br>
when you are told <br>
that people used to die,<br>
but not as cold<br>
as years untold...<br>
<p>
On ice<br>
as I  did lie.<br>
