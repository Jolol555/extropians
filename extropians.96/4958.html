While not specifically 'memetics', there are some concrete models. <br>
Here are abstracts from some of their stuff.  Most of these papers are <br>
available only as Postscript files.<br>

Computational Societies and Economies<br>
<p>
Large collections of computational agents have many analogies to <br>
market economies and biological<br>
ecosystems in that the individuals must make decisions, based on local <br>
information that is often<br>
incomplete, out of date and uncertain.<br>

     Distributed systems, social and computational, are characterized <br>
by individual programs or<br>

delayed information:<br>

     Cooperative problem solving is a powerful method for approaching <br>

You also wrote (on another thread):<br>
&lt;Many religions have been propagated through force of the sword.  In <br>
many cases this proved to be an effective technique.  If religion is <br>
such a profoundly intertwined aspect of a person's being, how were so <br>
many countries and regions "converted" permanently and effectively <br>
simply by force, even if occupation was relatively transient?  This <br>
seems to be inconsistent with the supposed nature of religion.&gt;<br>
<p>
The simple answer is that religion has rarely been separated from <br>
politics, economics and culture.<br>
