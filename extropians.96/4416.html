        Here's something I just received via e-mail from the advocates of<br>
self-government.  Unfortunately, it is anonymous.  I think it sums up what<br>
the 25th should be like...<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   Twas the night before Christmas,<br>
   And all through the land<br>
   Libertarians dreamed of the ideals of<br>
   Rothbard, Hayek and Rand.<br>
   <br>
   Enchanted by this glorious vision of liberty,<br>
   Many yearned for better ways to help their neighbors see<br>
   The great benefits that would come if they'd only embrace<br>
   A philosophy of freedom for all, whatever country or race.<br>
   <br>
   At our home the stockings and decorations were up,<br>
   We'd left Santa some cookies and some milk in a cup.<br>
   The children were nestled all snug in their beds<br>
   While visions of Liberty danced in their heads.<br>
   <br>
   I in my Advocates T-shirt, and Mom in her Self-Governor's Cap,<br>
   Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br>
   When outside the window there arose such a clatter<br>
   That I leapt from my bed to see what was the matter!<br>
   <br>
   There through the window I saw an amazing sight<br>
   That any other time of year would have given me a fright!<br>
   A sleigh pulled by reindeer flashing through the sky so quick,<br>
   And led by no less than -- Jolly Old St. Nick!<br>
   <br>
   As he roared through the air, heading straight for my abode,<br>
   I saw the sled was groaning with a tremendous load<br>
   Of packages, treasures, treats and toys --<br>
   Gifts for all good men, women, girls and boys!<br>
   <br>
   More rapid than a jet, right toward me they came!<br>
   And I heard Old St. Nick call each reindeer by name:<br>
   "Now Tolerance! Now Free Enterprise! Now Liberty!<br>
   Onward Peace, and Free Speech, and Prosperity!"<br>
   <br>
   He kept calling their names in that manner, and 'twas thus<br>
   I realized with a start --"Hey, Santa's one of Us!"<br>
   <br>
   I had always admired this very special man,<br>
   Who flew 'round the world without posting an FAA flight plan,<br>
   Who crossed national borders with impunity each year,<br>
   And never registered his team with the U.S. Department of Reindeer.<br>
   Who laughed at licenses and permits and just made his own route,<br>
   And ran a safe, clean, happy workshop far from OSHA's obnoxious snout.<br>
   <br>
   Who lived independent and government-free at the icy North Pole,<br>
   Far away from taxes, regulations and the dole.<br>
   <br>
   So I tiptoed downstairs to peep into the den,<br>
   And try and steal a sight of that jolly old gentleman<br>
   Who had brought such joy to millions in so many lands.<br>
   Oh, to see him in action, alive, first-hand!<br>
   <br>
   I heard the sleigh touch lightly down upon the roof,<br>
   Strange noises from my chimney came... then - POOF!<br>
   There was Santa standing boldly beside our Christmas tree,<br>
   Bigger than life in red and white -- an awesome sight to see!<br>
   <br>
   He took a bite of our cookies and said, "Hmmmm -- not bad!"<br>
   Then wrote a quick note of thanks to our youngest lad.<br>
   Then he reached down into the bulging bag at his side,<br>
   And talked aloud as he brought out what was stuffed inside:<br>
   <br>
   "Here's a new computer for Johnny, and it's all set<br>
   To take him to the Advocate's Web Page on the Internet!<br>
   He can also use it to subscribe, for free,<br>
   To the Liberator Online, which comes out via email bi-weekly!<br>
   <br>
   "Sally wants to reach libertarians in her home town,<br>
   So I've brought her the best outreach tool around!<br>
   Operation Politically Homeless will do the trick --<br>
   She'll find hundreds of new libertarians!" chuckled jolly old St.<br>
   Nick.<br>
   <br>
   Then he pulled out a vast supply of pocket-sized cards<br>
   And I could guess what they were, without trying too hard.<br>
   "Here's a few thousand of the World's Smallest Political Quiz, too!<br>
   That should last them for at least a month or two!<br>
   <br>
   "This family wants to communicate the ideas of freedom clearly,<br>
   So here are two fine tape sets which they will treasure dearly:<br>
   The Liberty Communicator Course and The Essence of Political<br>
   Persuasion<br>
   Will make them Master Communicators, no matter what the occasion!<br>
   <br>
   From his bag he brought forth still more great surprises --<br>
   Libertarian T-shirts and sweatshirts, in all different sizes<br>
   And festooned with neat slogans. Then there were books galore --<br>
   Libertarianism in One Lesson, The Law, and many more!<br>
   <br>
   By now our living room seemed filled to overflowing,<br>
   But still Santa kept on going and going.<br>
   He scattered audio tapes by the dozen in every empty spot.<br>
   "There are so many great Advocates tapes -- they'll like all these a<br>
   lot!<br>
   <br>
   "And here's a grand video that can help our ideas win:<br>
   Self-Government: An Idea Whose Time Has Come... Again!<br>
   And I'll leave them a couple of tested, proven speech kits<br>
   So their future service club or schoolroom speeches are big, big<br>
   hits!"<br>
   <br>
   He was bringing out still more goodies, but I could stand it no more<br>
   So I stepped out from hiding and stood by the door.<br>
   He smiled at me and winked, and I knew instantly<br>
   He'd known I had been there throughout his gift-giving spree.<br>
   <br>
   "I just wanted to thank you --" I began to say.<br>
   But he held up his hand and smiled in his jolly way.<br>
   "There's no need for thanks! It's a great pleasure to me<br>
   To give gifts to people who care so much about liberty!<br>
   <br>
   "The Advocates have made it easy for me and my elves --<br>
   In fact, we hardly have any work to do ourselves!<br>
   For people who want to see our world freed,<br>
   The Advocates have just the products, tools, and services we need.<br>
   <br>
   "If you want to thank me, the best thing you can do<br>
   Is to support the Advocates -- and put these great tools to work for<br>
   you.<br>
   Oh, there's one thing more I want to leave. Here --<br>
   Keep this Advocates catalog handy, so you can order throughout the<br>
   year!"<br>
   <br>
   I wanted to say more, but he put his finger to his nose,<br>
   Then -- POOF! Straight up through my chimney he rose!<br>
   I went to my window, and saw the sleigh rise into the sky,<br>
   And as they faded away, I heard Santa cry:<br>
   <br>
   "On, Free Speech! On, Tolerance! On, Liberty!<br>
   There's a whole wide world yearning to be set free!<br>
   The night is young, and we've got lots to do!<br>
   Next stop: switches and ashes for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue!"<br>
