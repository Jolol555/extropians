I cooked up something I called "Active Insulation" last year, after a <br>
conversation with Marvin Minsky. The idea<br>
is to counter an incoming phonon (or one vector component of the <br>
phonon) with an anti-phonon, analogous to noise cancellation.<br>
One problem I ran into with nanomechanical implementations is the noise <br>
from the mechanism itself.<br>

<p>
Yes- of that single atom. Its thermal energy was 3/2kT before the <br>
stilling, then its new temperature is derived from same.<br>
<p>

hardest<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
A good start! Usually one wants to transfer material in and out of the <br>
dewar, so some lid or tube is needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think this is a rather fun problem, but I don't see much use for it.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What applications do you have in mind&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Minsky had something really cool in mind, but I can't remember right <br>
now what that was.<br>
