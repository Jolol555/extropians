<i>&gt; Are you a slave or a boss?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I must tell you straight out: those "poor masses" , those "slaves" are also</i><br>
<i>&gt; human beings with dignity and may not appreciate the kind of "help" you</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose. Nor your labeling them as helpless or as slaves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the most irritating thing about this kind of "liberal".  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing against liberals,they mean well, but this kind of thing really is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; blind spot. I live with it in my arts complex  where everyone ostensibly vies</i><br>
<i>&gt; for who can do the most to "help" the poor masses,  the "others more</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfortuante than we" -  but it is actually self serving self congratulatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; rhetoric.  </i><br>

I'm sorry, but tell me the dignity that a worker in a chinese toy factory <br>
is the same as the dignity of Joe Coors. I'm not standing up for these <br>
people because I tink they're subhuman, but becasue they ARE human. <br>
Dignity comes with freedom, and it's very hard to be free while slaving <br>
for someone else. Trust me, visit a sweatshop. Nobody likes working <br>
there. They have no choice. They have no freedom. A choice between <br>
wage-slavery and starving is not much of a choice. Notice how they <br>
try to start unions to empower themsleves, only to find union leaders <br>
"mysteriously" killed. They are possibly more unfortunate, but more <br>
likely victimized by our society. It's not self-serving <br>
to stick up for those who can't be heard, it's not self serving to <br>
protest for human rights. Helping people has gotten a bad name, and by <br>
reducing it's value you hope to destroy any traces of benevolence at <br>
all.   <br>
