I made the point that people's minds are linked, forming a larger mind, <br>
because the signals we send each other through our communication are basically <br>
a way that clusters of neurons influence each other between brains.  I believe <br>
that this process is not qualitatively different than clusters of neurons <br>
influencing each other within a single brain.  Chris Hind responded (rather <br>
bluntly), "Wrong. Externally messages are have a greater delay between send <br>
and recieve and also allow for misinterpretation..."<br>
<p>
This may be true.  Or maybe not.  Different areas of our brain may have just <br>
as long of a lag time in communicating with each other as we do when we <br>
communicate with someone else.  We just don't know.  Yeah, a neuron can fire <br>
pretty fast, but to transfer a pattern of communication from one region of the <br>
brain to another that has as much complexity as what we communicate through <br>
speech, it may take just as long inside the brain as it does between brains.  <br>
Keep in mind that our communication provokes huge storms of association in the <br>
people we communicate with.  Think about all the thoughts this message is <br>
triggering in your mind right now.  <br>
<p>
Chris brought up that our communication with each other allows for <br>
misinterpretation.  Why is it assumed that there is no misinterpretation going <br>
on inside a single brain?  Do you understand all your thoughts perfectly?  <br>
Think about some of your thoughts for a while.  After thinking about them for <br>
a while, did you understand them more clearly?  If so, then perhaps you <br>
misunderstood yourself when you first considered the thoughts, and by thinking <br>
about them further, you clarified your thoughts to yourself, much the same as <br>
we clarify our thoughts to each other through the course of a conversation.  <br>
There is not instant understanding between people, but I don't think there is <br>
instant understanding between regions of the brain either.  There is much <br>
exchange and feedback and through a gradual process of alignment, both parties <br>
reach a greater understanding of each other and often of themselves.<br>
<p>
Having done much observation of my own patterns of thinking and observation of <br>
the patterns of communication between humans, the process seems very similar <br>
to me.  In my thinking, my thoughts provoke storms of association, and they <br>
follow the same sort of winding path that people do when they communicate with <br>
each other.  Yes, our communication is unpredictable, and we never know what <br>
we will trigger in other people when we say things, but I think our internal <br>
thoughts are just as unpredictable and we have just as difficult a time <br>
causing ourselves to think a particular thought; we never know what <br>
associations we will trigger in others or in ourselves.  We just have a <br>
general idea of what we're trying to get at, and we keep trying to steer the <br>
process in the direction we want it to go, constantly adjusting as we receive <br>
feedback.<br>
<p>
In short, I belive that our individual thought processes are part of a much <br>
larger thought process that is a result of the way individual brains link up <br>
with each other.  Because we communicate so intensely and assimilate each <br>
other's ideas so freely, we are participating in the processes of a larger <br>
mind, which acts as coherently and intelligently as any individual mind <br>
composing it.  This is not any more mystical than the idea that our minds are <br>
the result of the interactions between individual neurons and clusters of <br>
neurons in our brains.  I don't think the process of exchange between brains <br>
is all that different than the processes of exchange going on in individual <br>
brains.<br>
<p>
When we communicate, we do not *transmit* ideas to each other; we provoke <br>
storms of association in each other.  The same thing happens within our minds <br>
when we think of an idea on our own.  Parts of our mind provoke storms of <br>
association within other parts of our mind.<br>
<p>
Even the way groups of people work together to complete goals is very similar <br>
to how an individual works on a project on their own.  Different parts of the <br>
system watch each other and adjust their activities according to what other <br>
parts are doing.  Humanity is acting together as a fairly coherent and <br>
intelligent mind.  It is very much like a child, learning and growing, <br>
becoming more organized and powerful.  It is pulling together spontaneously, <br>
through a process of intense feedback and adjustment among all parts of the <br>
system, much like the neurons in brains do as children (and adults) develop.  <br>
Humanity is growing up and learning to take care of itself better, learning to <br>
keep its cells (humans) alive longer and learning how to have them be more <br>
intelligent, creative and productive.<br>
<p>
I am curious -- what do you people think of this idea?  I would like to <br>
discuss it further, but I need some feedback from all who are interested.  Any <br>
criticisms and comments are welcome.<br>
<p>
Having multiple personalities makes it easier for me to see the parallels <br>
between an individual mind and the mind of the collective, Humanity.  But am I <br>
simply projecting my condition on Humanity as a whole?  I see the thousands of <br>
personalities in my own mind interacting to form a coherent, intelligent <br>
entity, and I think that all humans interact to form a similar type of <br>
coherent, intelligent entity.<br>
