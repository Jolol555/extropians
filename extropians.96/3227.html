<p>
I dunno about that but the friend I went with who is a total trekkie said<br>
that he'd pitch in some cash as well to fuel the funding of R&amp;D for space<br>
travel. I would also think that they would definately pitch in some cash<br>
after just watching "Star Trek: First Contact" because the plotline had<br>
alot to do with creating the first warp drive and making first contact with<br>
the first alien race we'd ever met and how it united the world. (don't want<br>
to spoil who the first contact was but anyone familiar with Star Trek TOS<br>
or TNG can pretty much figure it out)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do think it would work? ready to put in the hours?</i><br>
<p>
Hell yeah! ANYTHING to get OUT THERE!<br>
<p>

<p>
Lots of questions. Perhaps we should get a group of people together.<br>
