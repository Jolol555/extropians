<i>&gt; I would also claim that ownership is a mental construct. In fact I</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be pushed to argue (I'm kind of tired as I write this) that many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our "rights" follow from that concept we call ownership.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I also believe that ownership is a mental construct, but I believe it <br>
has evolved because it promotes the survival of the species.  Self <br>
ownership forces one to be aggressively responsible for the outcome <br>
of one's life.<br>
<p>
I would say that *all* our "rights" follow from the concept of <br>
ownership.  I can't think of a fundamental "human right" that isn't <br>
based on the concept of self-ownership.  If you don't "own" yourself <br>
then any right you may have is transferred to the larger society or <br>
government.<br>
<p>
I believe a "victim" results when a person *believes* they own <br>
themself, when in reality they have given up much of their self <br>
ownership.  Citizens of countries such as China or Singapore don't <br>
generally consider themselves "victims" because they know and accept <br>
the fact they have given up aspects of their self-ownership.  I think <br>
the tendency towards being a "victim" in the United States has <br>
actually been caused by the increasing number of government social <br>
programs.  Traditionally, Americans have placed a lot of value on <br>
self-ownership and self-determination.  The growing number of social <br>
programs is usurping self-ownership, unnoticed by most citizens.<br>
<p>
I find a lack of self-ownership problematic for any society because <br>
it shifts responsibility and motivation away from the individual and <br>
to the society at large.  The "victim" attitude is what results when <br>
society becomes responsible for a persons welfare.  Because an <br>
individual no longer owns themselves, they are not responsible for <br>
what happens to themselves, and therefore are simply "victims" of the <br>
entity that does own them.  <br>
<p>
Being a "victim" is an often misdirected retaliation for the purpose <br>
of regaining self-ownership.<br>
