So, you are still trying to evade my question.  You admit that no one will<br>
substantiate your claim that there *is* an AI on the list.  You are still<br>
hiding behind a curtain.<br>
<p>
The only remaining question is whether Emporer Lyle is wearing any clothes,<br>
or is just a pile of silicon.<br>

<p>
A false response.  I never said I had time to set up some other test; I<br>
said I could *design* such a test.  (Perhaps a language recognition error?)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's interesting to me that you think you would have to read and analyze</i><br>

<i>&gt;"obviously not AI" category, so you would only have to scrutinize the</i><br>
<i>&gt;others?</i><br>
<p>
Why? Because I don't follow all of the threads, so there are some<br>
individuals' posts that I rarely if ever read.  (Only a computer would<br>
assume otherwise.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The fact [that] the "AI" is using a borrowed identity also suggests</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it has some serious weaknesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whether it has weaknesses isn't the point.  We all have weaknesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The question here is whether the AI can successfully participate in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the discussions on the list without giving itself away.  So far it has</i><br>
<i>&gt;succeeded brilliantly.  Nobody has a clue about who it is, and most</i><br>
<i>&gt;people seem to take it for granted that this is merely "Lyle's game,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;as Hal Finney put it.</i><br>
<p>
I get it.  An AI "has succeeded brilliantly" even though it may be merely<br>
imitating someone, and from time to time that someone posts directly to<br>
save the AI from revealing itself.<br>
<p>
Gee.  Why not just claim there is an AI that has achieved consciousness,<br>
but it's too busy writing its memoirs to be subjected to public scrutiny?<br>
<p>
Really, I would like to believe there is an AI on this list performing<br>
"brilliantly."  I have no reason to doubt this will happen sooner or later.<br>
But I do have a problem with your evasion of simple and fair questions.<br>
Until an appropriate authority confirms there is an *AI* on this list --<br>
which would be revealing absolutely nothing more than what you have already<br>
claimed -- then I'm not going to give a thought to trying to figure out<br>
"who" is the AI.  Real people sometimes post very terse messages, or say<br>
things that seem off-target or even stupid, and we could (falsely) accuse<br>
them of being an AI.  Given the current state-of-the-art, that could be<br>
taken as an insult.<br>
<p>
But if there is an AI here... it must be you.  Not because you are<br>
succeeding brilliantly, but because you evade simple questions.  That can<br>
be done with far less than human intelligence! &lt;g&gt;<br>
