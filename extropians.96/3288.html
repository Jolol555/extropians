<i>&gt;Excuse me, but this is not poetry.  It doesn't scan.  It has no structure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Writing prose in short lines doesn't make it into poetry.</i><br>
<p>
Personally, I believe that there _is_ such a thing as free verse; the<br>
lines must not just be short, they must have rhythm to them.<br>
<p>
I also find much of the poetry that has been appearing here rather<br>
tedious, because the rhythms are often approximate at best, and the<br>
rhymes seem forced.  Too bad for me; no poet requires that I like<br>
his/her poetry.<br>
<p>
Can we call it a matter of taste and get on with life?  Wrangling<br>
about "proper" art reminds me of one of the things I dislike about<br>
Ayn Rand.<br>
