[SNIP of John vs. Lyle,]...<br>
 I agree with your main point. We need to spend less time yelling at<br>
each other and more time trying to identify our actual points<br>
of disagreement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; *detailed architecture and practise* of certain canonical nano claims, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; does so in a teasing and finally annoyingly flip manner.  John (among</i><br>
<i>&gt; others) seems to respond as if Lyle's requests for detailed flow-charts are</i><br>
<i>&gt; redundant and even slightly blasphemous acts of lese majeste.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a shame, because we need the detail even more than the grand</i><br>
<i>&gt; speculative strokes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
True. Read NANOSYSTEMS, not just "Unbounding the Future", etc. I intend<br>
this as a positive suggestion, not as the "generic canonical aswer to<br>
all pleas for detail." In particular. I'll try hard not to refer to<br>
NANOSYSTEMS in response to a detailed question  unless I cite a specific<br>
paragraph. In this case, you are making a broad requiest, so I'm giving<br>
a<br>
broad answer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To consider a recent exchange: I asked whether people in an early nano</i><br>
<i>&gt; society might be obliged to accept draconian authoritarian controls to</i><br>
<i>&gt; forestall self-obliterative use of an Unstoppable Salt Mill (you know, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairytale device that explains why the sea is salt - it's down under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; water even now, cranking out its ceaseless stream of salt).  The range of</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses stretched from (a) it can't happen, because nano assemblers can</i><br>
<i>&gt; only do X and even that only with great difficulty,</i><br>
   Nope. If nanotech has any validity, then out-of-control naneotech is<br>
not<br>
a large incremental leap. <br>
<i>&gt; (b) it can and probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; will but that's okay because we (we?) will be off the planet by then (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2015?!) [and why won't the folks in the habitat or on Mars also bugger</i><br>
<i>&gt; things up with their handy assemblers?],</i><br>
   Good question. If "we" implies a community of humans, and it they<br>
used<br>
nanotech to leave earth, then unless they police the entire community,<br>
they<br>
run the risk of "wild" namotech.<br>
<i>&gt; (c) it's cool, because we (we???)</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have Transcended. </i><br>
     Quite possibly. Its a race between Trancendence (via the<br>
singularity?)<br>
  and the gray goo.<br>
<i>&gt; Do you see why Lyle (category a) might think he was</i><br>
<i>&gt; dealing with the Santa Claus Fan club?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
   Nope. I don't understand how people on this list can reject the <br>
premises just because the consequences are both strange and frightening.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wish he'd [Lyle] given detailed analyses of why modularised,</i><br>
<i>&gt; bottom-up-bootstrapping nanomech systems are impracticable. </i><br>
   <br>
I think you are asking for a bit too much for this list. I'd be<br>
satisfied wit a simple statement that he considers it impracticable,<br>
with<br>
a brief sketch of the reasons such as you give below. That would be<br>
sufficient to permit us to understand our differences and examine them<br>
further without rancor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suspect he</i><br>
<i>&gt; shares my hunch that orders of magnitude are being scamped when someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily gestures toward replication via atom-by-atom scanning,</i><br>
 I've never seen atom-by-atom scanning mentioned seriously except in<br>
science fiction. Do you have a reference?<br>
<i>&gt;or the AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; sophistication required to do the same job top-down.</i><br>
  This one needs a bit more excplication. We already do top-down design,<br>
fromn the level of city planning down to the level of individual<br>
circuits<br>
within a microprocessor. Why is this qualitatively harder when designing<br>
the smallest components from atoms? even if every single component must<br>
be designed by a human, we still get "free" manufacturing. The design<br>
effort is a very small part of the cost of a consumer item.<br>
