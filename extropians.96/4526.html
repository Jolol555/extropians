<i>&gt;I know most mathematicians work for NSA, and that NSA buys more than half </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the entire silicon output, _but that's not sufficient_. Or should they </i><br>
<i>&gt;have mastered quantum computers by now, to better factor primes? A lot of </i><br>
<i>&gt;cryptomethods do not rely on prime factoring. As in biological systems, </i><br>
<i>&gt;diversity of cryptosystems is the best protection.</i><br>
<p>
The reason they don't have quantum computers already is because the one<br>
thing the gov't doesn't have a monopoly on is good ideas. There are people<br>
working around the world on such ideas, what makes the US Gov't think<br>
they'll create them first? Even still I'd hope that they'd get them first<br>
as opposed to some other gov'ts because as of yet, the United States has<br>
handled advanced technologies the most responsibly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Like FTL? Attotechnology? Transcension? Spacetime engineering?</i><br>
<p>
Uhhh, What is Attotechnology?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Good grief, is there some rule to the effect that any time I join a</i><br>
<i>&gt;newsgroup or a mailing list, there _will_ be a debate on gun control?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whoever is guiding things along so that I can't get away from these</i><br>
<i>&gt;annoying subjects, d'you think just _once_ we could skip it?</i><br>
<p>
haha, Curse in the name of Spontaneous Orders.<br>
