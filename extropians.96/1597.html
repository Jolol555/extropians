&lt;the school of architecture at the university of texas/austin was, at<br>
one time, very active in designing virtual spaces.  michael benedikt was<br>
the principle investigator.&gt;<br>
<p>
Benedikt edited a 1991 book from MIT Press called _Cyberspace: First<br>
Steps_ (in which Steve Pruitt, BTW, coauthored an article on virtual<br>
workspaces).<br>
<p>
Benedikt's article in the book offered some architectural principles for<br>
navigating among data objects in cyberspace, discussing extrinsic<br>
(location) dimensions, intrinsic (characteristic) dimensions, and how to<br>
transpose these.<br>
<p>
Benedikt proposed seven principles for cyberspace design [These are a<br>
cut &amp; paste of his words]:<br>
(1) The Principle of Exclusion (PE): two things cannot be in the same<br>
place at the same time.<br>
(2) The Principle of Maximal Exclusion (PME): always choose as extrinsic<br>
dimensions those that minimize violations of PE.<br>
(3) The Principle of Indifference (PI): the felt realness of any world<br>
depends on the degree of its indifference to the presence of a<br>
particular user and resistance to his desires.<br>
(4) The Principle of Scale (PS): the maximum visible-space velocity of<br>
user motion [across extrinsic dimensions] is an inverse monotonic<br>
function of the complexity of the visible world/dataspace.<br>
(5) The Principle of Transit (PT): travel between two points should<br>
occur through all intervening points and should incur costs proportional<br>
to the distance.<br>
(6) The Principle of Personal Visibility (PPV): individual users should<br>
be visible, in some non-trivial form, at all times to all other users in<br>
the vicinity but may choose which users they wish to see.<br>
(7) The Principle of Commonality (PC): virtual places should be<br>
objective, in a circumscribed way, for a defined community of users.<br>
