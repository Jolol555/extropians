<i>&gt;Sometimes terms like "eternal life" and "immortality" seemed to get </i><br>
<i>&gt;tossed around pretty casually around here.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know about them but immortality is more of a bonus for me rather<br>
than a passionate desire, I want to live as long as possible so that I can<br>
see as much progress as possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is a bit curious to me,</i><br>
<i>&gt;since one of the main driving forces behind my leaving Xtianity (and </i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimately bumping into transhumanism)that the idea of truly eternal </i><br>
<i>&gt;life ceased to automatically be appealing or even make any sense.</i><br>
<p>
Yes immortality won't make sense from our viewpoint today because we would<br>
be so incredibly modified that we cannot understand it in our current<br>
position. Hmmm. How would being a immortal uploaded digital being feel<br>
like? There have been posts based entirely on this fact. In my opinion to<br>
be a true atheist and not take technological immortality on faith, you must<br>
not make immortality your primary goal and point of focus. Extending life<br>
you can make a primary goal but not immortality itself because then it<br>
turns into faith.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately, </i><br>
<i>&gt;the answers they give tend to boil down to the most intellectually </i><br>
<i>&gt;dishonest trick in their arsenal: It's beyond human understanding.</i><br>
<p>
I REALLY hate to say it but immortality as a uploaded being really is<br>
beyond human understanding. It sounds lame like religion but as technology<br>
progresses we will understand it more and more. The difference between this<br>
and religion is that with religion they say you understand after you die<br>
with no physical proof where with this you actually will be able to see the<br>
benefits while you're still alive guaranteeing you that it actually works.<br>
