First, yes, but it makes a *lot* more sense to me when I consider the idea<br>
from within the Zen Buddhist tradition than it does to me when I consider<br>
the idea from within any Western tradition that I'm likely to affiliate<br>
myself with.<br>
<p>
Second, Nietzsche was one of those unreasonable jerks who wrote about<br>
everything that interested him in nearly each one of his books, and did<br>
this for a reason, so it's hard to cite just one book as a place to<br>
concentrate reading to check a position. He really wasn't much of one for<br>
"positions" anyway... with Nietzsche a better metaphor would be<br>
"trajectories". But he talks a lot about the intellectual conscience and<br>
the quest for truth in THE GAY SCIENCE, and to a lesser extent in the first<br>
major section ("On the Prejudices of Philosophers") of BEYOND GOOD AND<br>
EVIL. He talks a lot about peace whenever he talks about "amor fati", which<br>
shows up a lot more often in his later works, from ZARATHUSTRA on. (Hmm, I<br>
wonder why.) But Nietzsche had dreadful health and was in pain more often<br>
than not, so comfort just wasn't big on his list of priorities since it was<br>
basically unobtainable for him.<br>

The guy was a weirdo, what can I say.<br>
