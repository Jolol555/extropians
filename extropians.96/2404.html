Also I began thinking further, we should simply upload all our brains to a<br>
'super meaty brain'! We could copy all our brains to a 'super meaty' brain<br>
which has been engineered to support many consciousnesses and you'd be<br>
jacked into a virtual world w/AI helpers. ou inside the meaty brain would<br>
be the 'real' one and you could use your subconscious for multitasking or<br>
spur AI duplicates of yourself. You could also send out and embody AI<br>
agents at other solar systems to colonize. We can also be moved from super<br>
meaty brain to super meaty brain by nano streams running between each of<br>
the meaty brains. You could also control animals or other biological drone<br>
bodies by remote control via a box in the drone's head acting as a PC-Brain<br>
interface.<br>
