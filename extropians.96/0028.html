The August '96 issue of Wired says that "the US is built on a US$7 <br>
trillion economic engine, only $300 billion of which is in cash."<br>
What will happen when cash is replaced by private cash cards (cards which <br>
use encryption to allow private transfer of electronic cash which exists <br>
only as bits on the cash card).  Would these bits still have to mean <br>
something?  Would the government still have to say how much money exists <br>
in "cash" even if that cash is only made up of bits?<br>
