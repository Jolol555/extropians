 The only use I can see of them is making clones of <br>
<i>&gt;ourselves with no brains, intended as organ donors. </i><br>
This would be another good use of them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; This then brings up the two contravercial topics of whether we should toy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with DNA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Doesn't this depend more on what we use it for than the act itself? I </i><br>
<i>&gt;know some people regard the genome as sacrosanct, but I doubt many on </i><br>
<i>&gt;this list does.</i><br>
I myself believe that we should toy and manipulate DNA as much as we wish. I<br>
was only referring to the luddites against genetic manipulation.<br>
<p>
Another use for these biological drones could be for venturing onto other<br>
planets supporting life. We could take native biological life on another<br>
planet and create a drone so that we could be uploaded to a box in the<br>
drones head and control it through an interface between bio motor functions<br>
and the box.<br>
