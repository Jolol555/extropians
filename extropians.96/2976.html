Regarding the discussion of explosive residue, here's <br>
a logical answer: <br>
<p>
Explosives residue was found, but they said it was from <br>
the time when the plane (1) was used to ferry munitions <br>
during the gulf war and (2) was used for bomb sniffing <br>
dog training. If we are to believe this, the plane is <br>
neutralized with respect to bomb residue evidence.<br>
<p>
But more important, at my web site on the topic I've pieced <br>
together the case for missile kill leaving no explosives residue: <br>
<p>
        FACT 12: While investigators claim that there is no<br>
        evidence that a missile or bomb exploded inside the<br>
        plane, information was leaked to the AP that a train-<br>
        ing guided missile with no warhead that locks onto <br>
        the center-of-mass may have passed through the plane <br>
        without exploding. Such a missile would leave two big<br>
        clues: (a) the missile would strike "the center fuel<br>
        tank, touching off the explosion," and it (b) "would  <br>
        only leave a small hole." Associated Press (09/22/96).<br>
<p>
        FACT 13: (a) "The explosion that brought down TWA <br>
        Flight 800 occurred in the center fuel tank area,<br>
        the lead investigator [said]." Reuter (08/22/96).<br>
<p>
        FACT 14: (b) Investigators reconstructing the debris <br>
        say there is a hole going into the plane and a hole <br>
        going out of the plane. Associated Press (09/23/96):<br>
<p>
                ...a source...said on condition of <br>
                anonymity.... ``There's metal bent <br>
                in, metal bent out. Metal you can't <br>
                tell. I see a hole going in and a <br>
                hole going out...''<br>
<p>
There it is, the necessary clues for what happened minus residue.<br>
