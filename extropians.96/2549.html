[Eugene: upload sex is obsolete.]<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think the uploads will be able to afford conventional (simulated</i><br>
flesh) sex much longer. If we assume resources to be limited (unless<br>
computation can be detached from the material carrier and we start<br>
engineering our designer universes)&gt;<br>
<p>
         First of all, who here, assumes that sex, or<br>
uploaded simulation of, requires a flesh simulation?<br>
We can understand that "mind" itself can experience<br>
orgasm, in a 'wet dream' why must the uploads be <br>
in flesh form to trade the impulses, electro<br>
chemical or neuro connected (glandular) versions <br>
of the pleasant, visual "fireworks " of orgasm or<br>
pleasureable contact? In this case I wonder if you<br>
are missing the point entirely of being "uploaded".<br>
The idea of uploading assumes computational <br>
abilities which can carry an intelligence, a human<br>
personality which we can *recognize as us* into an<br>
environment. If we do want to retain some human <br>
elements, it may be neccessary to emulate some <br>
hormonal action- remember this thread started with<br>
Rich, who seems to think men are pretty much<br>
hormone driven creatures; - )<br>
How much bandwidth to simulate the impulses of the hypothalamus? In our<br>
current  "WETWARE", it takes up<br>
only about one three hundredth of the brain.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;_and_ we admit Darwinian evolution in </i><br>
(it will be impossible to keep him out, I'm afraid -- notice that this <br>
automagically introduces some form of death, or do we speak Lamarckian <br>
evolution here, where mutation leaves the organism altered, but alive-o?), <br>
<p>
I'm afraid Lamarckian evolution finally  may<br>
have it's day in any conscious software that can<br>
reprogram itself at will.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;we'll wind up having scarce resources, more sooner than later. Some of them</i><br>
being time (attention devoted, etc), computation, whatever.<br>
<p>
<p>
Not enough bandwidth for VR? I notice there is no talk<br>
here of what TYPE of upload, dry, semi-soft, wet... <br>
In neural activity, things move rather quickly, and<br>
upload time will be at least as fast, a healthy sexual encounter may be<br>
considered leasurely and lengthy<br>
if it takes a second....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Burning computational resources for body dynamics, fakespace renderers, </i><br>
etc. might become too costly, once entire system matter has been <br>
converted into a Dyson shell computer <br>
(very soon, &lt;&lt;1 kYr), and this <br>
mind substrate dish populated sufficiently densely (much faster, &lt;&lt;1 Yr).<br>
 <br>
<p>
You know this to be the only future? How so?<br>
Even Moravec doesn't put too much faith in this.. <br>
I think he called Dyson's ideas "new and half baked..."<br>
these are lovely ideas, but hardly concrete.<br>
but even if it is so certain in your mind...<br>
<p>
... why this attachment to replication and body? dont you enjoy a good<br>
mindfuck?<br>
