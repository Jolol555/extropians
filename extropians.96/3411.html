HAL DUNN:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;An agnostic, therefore, is one who maintains that there might be some</i><br>
<i>&gt;supernatural being that is closed to human knowledge.  Religious "belief" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;based on whatever it is you believe -- and usually "faith."  One can't say:</i><br>
well I WANT to believe, so I will.  Nor can one say: I don't &gt;WANT to<br>
believe, so I won't.  You either believe or you don't believe.  (Of course<br>
<i>&gt;you can always change your mind.)  };-}</i><br>
<p>
IMHO, most atheists are convinced that "god" is an impossiblity, and it is<br>
not subject to their "faith or<br>
belief" but usually to evidence (or lack of, explicitly).<br>
<p>
Also, IMHO, all agnostics do *not* believe in "some supernatural being",<br>
 rather they allow that there may <br>
be some kind of guiding universal power (often forces of nature, unknown<br>
physics, some kind of unyet discovered<br>
scientific or macro-cosmic (nonanthropomorphic) laws.<br>
<p>
The thing you talk about is what I heard the Secular<br>
Humanists refer to as an _Uncertain Deists_.<br>
<p>
(Believes there probably is some kind of god, but not<br>
sure what it is.)<br>
