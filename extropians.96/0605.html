<i>&gt; &gt;Speak for yourself!  When I joined this ML, I did it because I love</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;conversing with people who have similar views as me.  I did NOT join because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;someone led me to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; True you did it yourself but that is because you are more intelligent than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the general populous and are ahead of the pack and have the knowledge to</i><br>
<i>&gt; find our mailinglist and subscribe. I believe that the lesser intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; masses need a leader because they're driven by mysticism and irrationality.</i><br>
<p>
Having a leader will only perpetuate these traits, in those who have<br>
them.  Having to fend for yourself is one of the best avenues out of<br>
these holes: if what you do is not in accordance with your real<br>
survival requirements, you fail.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Once you reach a certain point intellectually, you can finally fend for</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself as we do.</i><br>
<p>
1.) We don't have a monopoly on the ability to fend for ourselves.<br>
<p>
2.) Maturity is achieved through responsibility, which itself<br>
	requires freedom.<br>
