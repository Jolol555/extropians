I'm very interested in finding out more about the kinds of people who think<br>
of themselves as extropians or Extropians, and about what kinds of people<br>
are most open to these ideas. It seems that, according to one fairly crude<br>
measure, many are INTP or ENTP, but that doesn't really tell us much. Also,<br>
I worry about looking for simple criteria because I'd rather find ways of<br>
*broadening* the appeal of extropian ideas to a wider range of personality<br>
types, rather than only seeking those who already think in similar ways.<br>
(Obviously there are limits to this; certain personality traits strongly<br>
militate against openness to extropian ideas and attitudes, such as deep<br>
fear and loathing of change.)<br>
<p>
  I've posted<br>
<i>&gt;before about my surveys of personality types and birth order</i><br>
<i>&gt;predictors.  My intuition is that what we mainly have in common is</i><br>
<i>&gt;technical understanding and a genuine excitement and willingness to</i><br>
<i>&gt;think carefully about the near and distant future.</i><br>
<p>
Birth order seems to be a terribly blunt instrument. I will divide the<br>
population into only a very few categories, and so seems incapable of<br>
telling us anything useful in terms of discovering proto-extropians, even if<br>
it turns out that we are all third-born or whatever. And I seriously doubt<br>
there is much of a pattern there anyway. Nor do I think technical<br>
understanding will distinguish proto-extropians from others well, though it<br>
will often be a factor that contributes to extropian sympathies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It would be possible to construct a survey of Extropians and some</i><br>
<i>&gt;control sample of non-Extropians, with questions about agree/disagree</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Max's attitudes, about personality type, and about the other</i><br>
<i>&gt;predictors I mentioned, and then do some statistics to see which of</i><br>
<i>&gt;these are the best predictors.</i><br>
<p>
Are you offering?!<br>
