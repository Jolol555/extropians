<i>&gt;There is only a very loose correlation between income (or net worth)</i><br>
<i>&gt;and intellect.  There's a much stronger correlation between income</i><br>
<i>&gt;and economic system.  I disagree that the "masses" need a fuehrer.</i><br>
<p>
I believe that currently the masses need a fuehrer but when the general<br>
education of the population increases, we will no longer need one.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the eyes of the public as yet, Max is the "central extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; authority".</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;No, he isn't.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Then who is in the eyes of the mass media. Someone must be? Are do they see</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; us as a group only without a leader.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If they don't then they _should_.  People with representative opinions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;yes, but "leaders", no.</i><br>
Well Obviously but if you haven't noticed we're in dark ages currently where<br>
mysticism and irrationality reign but we're slowly crawling out of the dog<br>
shit that has been piling up for millenia.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Another thing... Who is that FM-2030 guy? I saw him in a review in Skeptic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and nowhere else is he mentioned. Who the hell is that guy?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Formerly known as "F. M. Esfandiary", author of *Upwingers*,</i><br>
<i>&gt;*Are You a Transhuman?*, and a number of other works.  He's been</i><br>
<i>&gt;around cryonics &amp; immortalist circles since the late 60's.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt;nice guy.  I have some political and economic disagreements with</i><br>
<i>&gt;him, but I like his spirit.</i><br>
I'd like to meet the guy. In the Skeptic article it rendered him a<br>
completely bizarre person. You explain him alot better and give more insight<br>
whereas Skeptic had him shrouded in mystery. How's the book upwingers? is it<br>
about uploading?<br>
