Yup, that's a good'un... as well as its more up-to-date cousin called <br>
"LOJBAN." (A websearch on LOJBAN could tell you plenty.)  It has been <br>
computer-tested to demonstrate that the language is NON-AMBIGUOUS when <br>
used in its full form.  Every verb has a specified syntax for the objects <br>
necessary to detail its action... if an object (or subject) is implied or <br>
ommitted, its absence is immediately noticed.  Ambiguity is still <br>
permissable, but simply by ommitting the information.<br>
<p>
Similarly, there exists a variant of English called "E-Prime" which is <br>
designed to exclude a lot of amibiguity.  It achieves this by removing <br>
the verb "to be." ("E-Prime = English - to_be.")  This effectively <br>
eliminates a huge number of oversimplified analogies/metaphores by <br>
demanding more active verbs in descriptions, and kills the passive voice <br>
of the laguage altogether.<br>
<p>
Even the language "tlhIngan Hol" ('Klingon') changes thinking by removing <br>
the verb "to be" and eliminating adjectives.  Adjectives are replaced <br>
with "active" verbs... a red ship would be "Duj Doq," or more literally <br>
"Ship Be-Red."<br>
<p>
David Musick argues that Language is not a vehicle to convey meaning but <br>
a method of provoking response in a meme.  But I believe this is not yet <br>
adequate without a little further qualification:  Language is a means to <br>
the ends of meaning... Meanings are a means to an ends of Response &amp; Meme.<br>
<p>
Words often have a multiordinant nature... some have an explicite <br>
meaning, while others have numerous associations.  When a language <br>
effectively redirects meaning, it effectively redirects how we <br>
communicate our meaning or lack of meaning.  <br>
<p>
Sometimes it is ambiguity itself that we capitalize upon in language.<br>
Many forms of Humor and Irony just don't work without duplicity or<br>
omission.<br>
