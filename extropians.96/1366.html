Jeff Dee wrote 9/27/96: &lt;I think that the 'use' of ontology is as an<br>
understanding that somewhere out there lies whatever actually exists in the<br>
universe, behaving according to whatever rules it follows.  Can we be certain<br>
about any of these 'facts'?  Maybe not.  But the less uncertain our knowledge<br>
is, the better our predictions get.  The only way to reduce the uncertainty of<br>
our epistemology to keep tinkering with it to more closely match ontology.&gt;<br>
<p>
Well put.  At the Extro^2 conference last year, I said: "It's the reduction of<br>
uncertainty in the incoming stream of continuous reality that tells us somewhat<br>
of the precursors to this stream.  The evolution of consciousness is accelerated<br>
as we get better at this.  We increase our ability to choose more adaptive paths<br>
of action as we anticipate future dangers that would threaten our purposes."<br>
