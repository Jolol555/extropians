In a message dated 96-12-18 01:24:52 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his<br>
thoughts.<br>
<i> &gt;I believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;better world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind</i><br>
whenever<br>
<i> &gt;&gt;they liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than</i><br>
half<br>
<i> &gt;&gt;the world's population killing each other.)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I have serious reservations about this sentiment.  The problems</i><br>
<i> &gt;of violence don't come from lack of adequate means of  communication, but</i><br>
<i> &gt;rather the refusal to communicate on a meaningful, productive level,</i><br>
<i> &gt;invariably stemming from  an initial refusal to think at all.</i><br>
 <br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;  All the ESP type powers given to people not inclined to some modicum of</i><br>
<i> &gt;rational thought and respect for other individuals will not a utopia make.</i><br>
 <br>
 I agree. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This brings up an interesting idea.  If everyone could read everybody elses<br>
mind, and presumably their sensory input as well, than where would one person<br>
end and another begin?  We could simply become one collective entity made up<br>
of billions of components in constant communication with each other, not<br>
unlike the human brain.<br>
<p>
For those familiar with Star Trek (forgive for invoking television but this<br>
is the best example I can think of) you could think of the Borg (ignore the<br>
recent movie).  Most people react with horror at the idea of ever becoming a<br>
cybernetic being controlled by an impersonal collective.  What most do not<br>
realize is that we are moving towards that stage.  Already communication is<br>
becoming increasingly easy.  Now we can wear a cellular phone.  As for the<br>
cybernetics part, that should be obvious to any extropian.  <br>
<p>
Communications technology will continue to advance and eventually we will<br>
learn enough about the brain to tap into the language center with our<br>
communications technology.  From there we could progress to other areas until<br>
we could transmit the complete array of thoughts and perceptions we have at<br>
any one moment.  Some may think that people would never allow this but people<br>
today say they would never carry a cellualr phone because they wanted to stay<br>
disconnected from the world at some times.  Many of those people have changed<br>
their minds (and many of the rest will be dead in thirty years or so).<br>
 People will sacrafice privacy for efficiency.  <br>
<p>
And this is where I tie in this digression to privacy.  Complete<br>
communication between members of a workgroup would allow for greatly<br>
increased efficiency.  There would be no more misunderstandings because of<br>
the limitations of language.  Time would not be wasted trying to find the<br>
right words.  One persons random thoughts might cause another person to come<br>
up with something.  The problem that specialization has created in dampening<br>
scientific innovation would be eliminated by total communication between<br>
specialists.  In the end, it would come to weighing privacy against profit.<br>
 You decide the odds. <br>
<p>
I am aware that many of the things I said have little backing in our current<br>
stage of technology.  I am also aware that the human brain may be unable to<br>
process the increased input.  Such things as neural-computer integration<br>
would help in this case.  That would be simple in comparison to mind reading.<br>
