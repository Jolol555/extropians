<i>&gt;the human's input would affect the computer's output to the human.</i><br>
.the human's decision rate can be very high in such a scenario, even with<br>
<i>&gt;fairly restricted human-to-computer commnications: watch a kid playing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;flight-simulation game to see what I mean. The I/O hardware is alrady in</i><br>
<i>&gt;place: what's missing is the software. </i><br>
<p>
There are lots of contexts where this already happens, including<br>
playing war games, financial trading, and web surfing.   High decision<br>
rates don't imply fast economic growth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The "SI Dream" scenario is a researcher (probably a grad student at</i><br>
<i>&gt;MIT, drinking Jolt cola at 2AM and programming when he should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;studying for an English exam.) The researcher is attempting to enhance</i><br>
<i>&gt;a decision-support system by interfacing it to a knowledge base and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;a graphical information-presentation system.  ...  his first trial run</i><br>
<i>&gt;is an attempt to optimize his prototype. He succeeds, and installs the</i><br>
<i>&gt;next version. With this version, he optimizes the operating system ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then, he grabs all the workstations in the dorm, via the net, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;oprimizes them.  ... then all computers on the campus, and then the</i><br>
<i>&gt;web.  ... By the end of the trading day, he owns a controlling</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest in a nice collection of companies on the NYSE.</i><br>
<p>
I can't say this is impossible, but it really is very unrealistic. <br>
We have had half a century of experience with computers, and no<br>
similar takeoff has occured, or anything close.  We have had feedback,<br>
lots of it, but growth rates have been relatively steady.  I think you<br>
need a good story about why your scenario hasn't yet happened to make<br>
it at all plausible. <br>
