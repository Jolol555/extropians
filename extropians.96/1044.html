I volunteered for a MRI brain scan yesterday... Both anatomic and <br>
functional. I'm going to stream the voxel data set onto a DAT cartridge <br>
to toy around with at leisure. Medical image processing, especially on <br>
voxels is currently making giant strides forward.<br>
<p>
Just a few impressions: you don't notice a (comparatively) low-Tesla <br>
field, unless you have something ferromagnetic. I've been told in 3..4 T <br>
research imagers you feel the induced electricity in terms of jolts/spasms. <br>
I've waved my hand vigorously in front of the magnet &amp; felt absolutely <br>
nothing...<br>
<p>
Concerning ferromagnetic objects: in older MRI's you felt the pull at <br>
your keys/wallet already at entering the tomograph room. It has become <br>
better, due to active shielding. If a coin escapes into the tube, <br>
you can usually slide it outside &amp; then detach it. Pictures become bad if <br>
a coin is in the tube, though. Field's becoming inhomogenous.<br>
<p>
Larger pieces of steel are downright dangerous. I've been told of a <br>
video: there a modest-sized pipe wrench experienced a 70 kg (sic) pull. <br>
For this particular object this meant a 10 g acceleration. You are <br>
lucky, if the thingy stays in the tube, usually it flies right through, <br>
gets deccelerated as it leaves the tube, returns &amp; comes back sailing <br>
out. At you. Not recommended.<br>
<p>
In one documented case a floor-washing machine has been yanked into the <br>
magnet... I shudder to think what would happen if you happened to stand <br>
between the magnet &amp; the machine at that moment... Great fun. <br>
Squashed human sandwich.<br>
<p>
You hear the different pulse sequences: the gradient coils experience a <br>
force in the strong field. Rectangular pulses sound harsh, sinus is <br>
downright melodic. With some training, you could probably write down the <br>
pulse sequence from hearing ;) . The entire scan lasted for about 2.5 h. <br>
It somewhat resembles an isolation tank experiment: you can't move, you <br>
see only the inside of the tube, hearing only extremely monotonous sounds. <br>
(It's pretty loud, one has to use oropax). Apart from experiencing acustic <br>
hallucinations, you grow really sleepy really soon.<br>
<p>
Though UKW power is not negligeable, you don't feel warmth in a head <br>
scan. With body scan this is supposed to be different. On larger-Tesla <br>
machines some pulse sequences are locked, since they would induce <br>
harmful potential deltas. It's not funny if you're downright obese as <br>
well. Then you might feel it even in standard MRI. <br>
<p>
Functional MRI uses the fact that oxy/desoxy hemoglobine has different <br>
magnetic properties. In a motorics experiment, moving your fingers <br>
requires activity in the according motoric homunculus area of the cortex, <br>
which needs stronger blood flow, etc. Temporal resolution's bad, but <br>
spatial is very good. In contrast to PET, this is both cheaper &amp; less <br>
hazardous (both for the environment &amp; for you).<br>
<p>
During the scan the entire room is full of heavy EM smog. It would <br>
probably roast the average microcontroller, so they use fiber optix.<br>
<p>
For physical reasons, minimal voxel size is several microns, and then <br>
only for tiny specimens (insects/mice). This is called MRI microscopy.<br>
For uploading, vitrified cerebra are best. Unless incremental in <br>
vivo uploading is impossible, it has to be destuctive scan time...<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. Sorry for the private mails I didn't yet answer: they're in the <br>
processing pipeline.<br>
