Well, cancer occurs when a cell stops obeying the growth-inhibition<br>
signals from its surroundings, and in one way or another finds a way to<br>
circumvent the programmed cell death and immune system. It could quite<br>
well be said to try to extend the range of its lineage, which means that<br>
in some sense the deep ecologists are right - we are no longer following<br>
the old rules. The question is of course if one can view the ecology as an<br>
organism (Gaia) as they do; that is very close to the now defunct idea of<br>
"the harmony of nature". <br>
<p>
Cancers are really evolution in action; the proliferating cells mutate <br>
and adapt to their surroundings, sometimes coming up with great solutions <br>
that strongly help them in the short run but are disastrous in the long <br>
run (metastasis). We have to avoid getting into that kind of trap. <br>
