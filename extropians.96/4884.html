<i>&gt;Just as a general line of thought, specifically what is involved in memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering?  What are the steps and procedures involved?</i><br>
<p>
One model of memetic engineering, focusing specifically on <br>
propogation, goes under the informal name of "activism".  I <br>
introduced the topic of memetics amongst a group of organizers last <br>
summer, and they enthusiastically adopted it as a way of explaining <br>
what they do (one of the few times I have successfully connected <br>
progressives to a transhumanist subject!).<br>
<p>
To mount a successful meme propogation campaign takes advance planning <br>
and tactical knowledge.  This is rarely attempted by an individual;  <br>
usually a team is set up based on individual expertise and training.  <br>
Having a central visionary is also helpful--someone who where the <br>
campaign fits into a movement overall, someone who connects well to <br>
other people through an understanding of their hopes and fears.<br>
<p>
One of the major reference books in the area is _Organizing for Social <br>
Change_ by Kim Bobo, Jackie Kendall and Steve Max of Midwest Academy.  <br>
