You would have to execute the attached program in order for it to do<br>
anything.  If it is a virus infected executable, then executing it would<br>
most likely cause your system to become infected.  If it is a<br>
destructive program disguized as something useful, and doesn't replicate<br>
itself, then it's a trojan horse, not a virus.  Either way, it requires<br>
your active involvement to do anything.<br>
<p>
It is possible, however, for some kinds of executable code in a file<br>
attachment to execute automatically upon receipt.  Some email software<br>
can recognize document types and then launch an appropriate application<br>
to load the document.  If the document is a type that can contain<br>
executable code (MS Word files with programs written in Word's macro<br>
language are a notorious example), then it is indeed possible for a<br>
virus or trojan to load and execute automatically.  It all just depends<br>
on what software you are using and how you have it set up.  <br>
