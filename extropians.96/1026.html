The Tuesday 9/17/96 Wall Street Journal "In the Lab" column reported<br>
that virtual retinal displays (recall from Neal Stephenson's "Snow<br>
Crash") are about 4 years away.  However, they will initially cost<br>
between $5k and $50k. Seattle-based Microvision Inc. &amp; the Univ. of<br>
Washington Human Interface Technology Lab are working on this, primarily<br>
funded by the U.S. Army, which wants to use them with ground-penetrating<br>
radars for mine-sweeping operations.  Another big potential market at<br>
that price are surgeons and other medical applications.  The displays<br>
they're talking about would be superimposed on one's field of vision<br>
(appearing to be some distance in front of one's eyes) and wouldn't<br>
require bulky helmets. There was no mention of whether the user could<br>
provide any feedback to the system providing the display (i.e., nothing<br>
about whether eye movements could be used to select display options from<br>
a menu).<br>
