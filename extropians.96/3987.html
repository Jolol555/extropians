Pretty good work, especially at the time.  It had a strong "cyber" flavor;<br>
quite Gibson-esque.  Takes me back to the thriving hacker scene of the mid<br>
to late 80's and very early 90's before the flood of lamers kind of killed<br>
that scene.<br>
<p>
Sigh...The good old days...<br>

<i>&gt;We will soon only need the soundcard for previewing and analog input.</i><br>

<i>&gt;processor 200 Mhz Pentium Pro in a SMP system will be able to do nicely</i><br>

<i>&gt;pretty good one.). An when you don't make music on it you can make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;little music video.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Yes and no.  What operating system are you going to use on the SMP system?<br>
I have a room full of powerful Unix and NT boxes, but for things like MIDI,<br>
I still use Macs and Windows 3.1.  One negative feature of pre-emptive<br>
multitasking "advanced" OSs like NT is that the pre-emptive architecture<br>
sucks for any task that requires real-time precision timing.  <br>
<p>
Running a MIDI sequencer at 960ppqn or even 240ppqn is impossible in this<br>
type of environment because your sequencer may or may not be preempted just<br>
before it is supposed to send out a MIDI signal.  The practical MIDI<br>
resolution is very low, and the timing is off at any resolution.  In my case<br>
the problem is worsened because I usually use 8-16 MIDI ports in a fairly<br>
intensive manner, increasing the requirements on the system.  I used to run<br>
8 ports on a 386dx40 without any problems using Windows 3.1, but running 1<br>
port under NT on an SMP system usually gives poorer performance, especially<br>
at intermediate resolutions.<br>
<p>
However, there *is* a positive side to SMP systems such as NT.  I used to<br>
write small digital audio processing software under NT.  Most DSP algorithms<br>
for digital audio multi-thread really well.  This means that audio DSP<br>
performance scales almost linearly across multiple processors.  Non-realtime<br>
audio works great under these systems.  I do believe that eventually<br>
software on computers will replace all the dedicated hardware, but the synth<br>
software currently available (AFAIK) just doesn't work as well as dedicated<br>
hardware.  But I think most of the limitations are in getting real-time<br>
performance out of non-real-time operating systems, rather than the actual<br>
processing capabilities of the software, which is very impressive in some cases.<br>
<p>
NEW THOUGHT ON THE FLY:  I think the reason digital audio timing for<br>
playback and recording is unaffected by preemptive multi-tasking is that the<br>
audio cards pre-buffer the data.  If someone designed a MIDI interface card<br>
with a large buffer and real-time microcontroller to run the buffer, 1) the<br>
timing would be unaffected by preemption, and 2) you could run *a lot* of<br>
MIDI channels through that card.  Writing the device driver might be a<br>
little more complicated than usual, but workable.  Most MIDI interfaces I've<br>
worked with do not have significant buffering, and definitely nothing like a<br>
pre-transmission queue.  Hmmm...<br>
