<i>&gt; My post last night may have come as a shock to some people.  In this</i><br>
<i>&gt; post and the following one, I want to indicate very briefly what I mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; when I say there are logical gaps in Michael Shermer's argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
snipp....<br>
<i>&gt; Michael keeps talking about "convergence of evidence."  The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; here is that the evidence does not converge.  The mosaic-like pieces</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't give us a complete picture of the crime.  We have a series of</i><br>
<i>&gt; pictures which approach the gas chambers from both directions, before</i><br>
<i>&gt; and after.  They approach but they do not meet in the middle.  We have</i><br>
<i>&gt; pictures of prisoners arriving at the camp, and pictures of bodies being</i><br>
<i>&gt; cremated, but nothing in between.  There are no photographs of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; gassing operation itself.  That part (the essential part!) of the mosaic</i><br>
<i>&gt; is missing, so the series does not converge.</i><br>
<p>
Such photos are in existence, and can be accessed in the US Army<br>
archives, probably at your local National Archives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If there were photographs or movies of the gassing operation, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; there would be no such thing as revisionism.  Likewise, if there were</i><br>
<i>&gt; rooms in the ruins of Auschwitz that looked like the gas chambers in</i><br>
<i>&gt; American prisons, revisionism would be impossible.  If there were</i><br>
<i>&gt; records of the construction of gas chambers (as there are for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; construction of crematoria), revisionism would be impossible.  If there</i><br>
<i>&gt; were any documentation at all, any references by Himmler, Hitler, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone else to gas chambers, then revisionism would be impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Revisionism is possible only because there is a total lack of physical,</i><br>
<i>&gt; photographic, or documentary evidence for gas chambers.</i><br>
<p>
This is a total lie Lyle. The camps are still inexistence, though they<br>
are beginning to fall apart from age. Just because you personally have<br>
never been there is no reason to doubt their existence, and anyone who<br>
has told you they do not exist is either misled or a liar. I would<br>
suggest that anyone who doubts to go, as your own eyes will not lie.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If someone hadn't already heard about the gas chambers, he wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn about them from the speeches of Hitler, Himmler, and the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazis, nor from the photographs of the camps, nor from the documents</i><br>
<i>&gt; describing the camps, nor from examining the remains of the camps.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A naive person investigating this subject would have no indication</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever that there were gas chambers, if all he had to go on was</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-witness evidence.  One hears about gas chambers *only* from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; statements of Broad, Hoess, Nyiszli, and other such witnesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's why I refer you to the Nyiszli book, which is by far the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; accessible of the witness statements.  Judge for yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Lyle, I am really shocked that you would make such assertions. In our<br>
social studies class in junior high our teacher showed us films produced<br>
by the US Army at the end of the war of the camps. THey definitely<br>
showed gas chambers, and showed the gas apparatus. They also interviewed<br>
people who were prisoners at the camps who had been put on details to<br>
clean out the gas chambers after use.<br>
<p>
I am aware that some western US schools are infiltrated by neonazi<br>
sentiment and teach revisionist history, I have encountered the products<br>
of such school systems in my travels. I was not aware that there would<br>
be anyone on this list who still carried the poison of such<br>
disinformation.<br>
