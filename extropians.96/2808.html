<i>&gt; Regarding the post office, what you are really saying is that if you </i><br>

No.  If I go to up to a window at the post office, and say  "Hi, I need to <br>
send this package first class," the clerk weighs the package, takes <br>
my money, puts the sticker on the package, and wishes me a good day, <br>
just like the clerks at UPS offices.  <br>
<p>
As far as I recall, there has been only one exception to this.  At the <br>
on-campus post office at Stanford, they had some rude clerks; <br>
one in particular was notoriously surly.  On the other hand there were  <br>
some surly people in private businesses in Palo Alto in those days, <br>
too.   And since then I have run into some UPS clerks who were <br>
pretty abrupt.  <br>
<p>
Since last night I have been trying to remember if I have ever had any <br>
experience with the federal government.  Very little.  In high school <br>
I went to a summer course for gifted math students, sponsored by NSF.  <br>
Years later, I got an evaluation form in the mail, asking about whether <br>
the course had been useful to me.  The form had a threat attached:  <br>
either fill out this form, or you will never get any funding from NSF.  <br>
As it turned out, I have never applied for an NSF grant, so I don't know <br>
if they were bluffing.  They were certainly rude.  (I think I filled out <br>
the form anyway, since the course was a very positive experience and <br>
I wanted them to continue offering such courses.)  <br>
<p>
For every example of rudeness by government employees, I can <br>
think of a dozen examples of rudeness by employees (or owners) of <br>
businesses, including small businesses.  <br>
<p>
What I am "really saying" is <br>
1.  If you have NEVER been treated like a human being, then you are <br>
    bringing this on yourself.  If you treat other people like human beings, <br>
    they will usually reciprocate.   <br>
2.  You are trying to make your perceptions fit your ideology.  I am just <br>
    trying to remember what has happened to me, and in my experience <br>
    rudeness has been a random phenomenon -- it is no more common <br>
    among government employees than anywhere else.  <br>
