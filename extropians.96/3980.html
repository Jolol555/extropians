The fairly new field of evolutionary psychology studies just that. The<br>
unfortunate consensus of most researchers is that feelings and emotions<br>
were "designed" (i.e. evolved) to aid selfish DNA in replicating in the<br>
social and cultural environment of prehistory. This is because we<br>
haven't evolved much, genetically, since the Stone Age. So today these<br>
instinctual drives are often inappropriate and unproductive given an<br>
individual's personal goals.<br>
<p>
One big example is fear. Originally useful for keeping people safe from<br>
physical dangers (so they could reproduce), today people are scared of<br>
all sorts of imagined cultural "dangers" from meeting strangers to<br>
asking for a raise. These situations probably map onto ancient<br>
situations in which the fear was a useful tool for directing people's<br>
energy so that they would have the best chance of reproducing.<br>
<p>
Another important drive, as you mentioned, is for status. Vance Packard,<br>
author of The Hidden Persuaders (bestseller about subliminal<br>
advertising), died recently. He made quite an issue of Madison Avenue<br>
exploiting our drive to attain higher status to create the consumerist<br>
culture we have now.<br>
<p>
There have been several books written on evolutionary psychology. I have<br>
reviews of a couple good ones -- The Evolution of Desire by Buss and The<br>
Moral Animal by Wright -- in the Amazon.Com Memetics Bookstore<br>
(<a href="http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie/books.htm">http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie/books.htm</a>). There is also a chapter<br>
on evolutionary psychology in my own book Virus of the Mind. <br>
