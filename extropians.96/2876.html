<i>&gt; Thanks Twisty. BTW I like your pages. Do you think that there is a</i><br>

My theory about the relationship of different densities in our own system <br>
sorta springboards into other theories.  Seems to me there is also a <br>
relationship between planetary rings and low planet density, as well as a <br>
relationship between Life and high planet densities.<br>
<p>
Low planetary density can amass large total gravity while amassing lower <br>
local gravity.  This should be why Saturn, the solar system's least dense <br>
planet, has the most splendid ring system.  Low local gravity allows more <br>
stable particle orbits around the rings.<br>
<p>
Earth is the most dense planet in our system.  It stands to reason that <br>
its greater density and lower total gravity allow for some mighty-complex <br>
systems to form.  Perhaps Earth is the model of Extropian "Spontaneous <br>
Order."  Newton's Second Law of TD says that 'in a closed system, it can <br>
only degenerate into a state of lower complexity.'  With Earth open to <br>
the sun's energy, and its great density and moderate temperature <br>
facilitating the most fluid of systems, Life has the best chance of <br>
forming and/or continuing.  (By "most fluid," I mean the "triple point" <br>
between boiling point and freezing point provides more range for liquids <br>
to exist due to higher pressure.)<br>
<p>
I'm only an amateur, (can't afford Institutionalized Ed without mortgaging <br>
my future,) so I can only offer speculation about locating extrasolar <br>
planets.  The four known discoveries of such planets have been due to <br>
sheer mass pulling their suns in rapid cycles.  We need to improve our <br>
perception, collect more discerning data, to find small-but-dense planets <br>
like Earth.  Gravity alone doesn't cut it, because Jupiter is so much <br>
more massive (despite being less dense) that the sun get eleven to twelve <br>
times the pull from Jupiter than it does from Earth, regardless that <br>
Jupiter is four times as distant.<br>
<p>
Density of planets today are estimated by visibly measuring speed, <br>
distance, and diameter, in order to take a stab at the mass, and thus <br>
mass per volume.  One has to be in visual range to make good <br>
measurements.  It doesn't look as if this method will change in the near <br>
future.  Even if it did, we'd still likely have to move pretty close to <br>
these bodies to determine density... There just aren't enough indicators <br>
that can be read from an interstellar distance (at present).<br>
