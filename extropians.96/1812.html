William Kitchen:<br>
<i>&gt;My suspicion is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;time between being granted such miraculous machinery, and the emergence</i><br>
<i>&gt;of superintelligence would be exceedingly short. On the order of weeks</i><br>
<i>&gt;for one such as myself who only programs occasionally, perhaps only days</i><br>
<i>&gt;for an experienced programmer who does it as his primary method of</i><br>
<i>&gt;making a living, possibly even hours for a first class programming</i><br>
<i>&gt;wizard (especially one with a passion for mathematics).</i><br>
<p>
Rather than critisize your sispicion, I would like to test it. I challenge<br>
anyone on this list to participate in the Intelligence Programming Contest:=<br>
<p>
<p>
Your goal: Write a computer program (in your favourite formal language<br>
that doesn't require more than infinite time to compute), that will result<br>
in human intelligence or better.<br>
<p>
I will personally give one of my Power Infintium Personal Computer<br>
to the winner. (I will give it away at the omega point, but submissions<br>
must be postmarked *before* the omega point.)<br>
