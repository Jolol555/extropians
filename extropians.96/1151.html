I'm thinking of Englebart's SRI team in the early 70s, where they invented<br>
the mouse, windows, the first full hypertext publishing environment,<br>
etc.  Probably the most successful such attempt.  A team that takes<br>
off by focusing on its own augmentation was Englebart's big thing, but<br>
it created an ingrown focus that made it difficult for them to make<br>
their tools useful for other people.  They would claim these tools<br>
were useful, if you were willing to invest enough time in it, but<br>
others preferred WYSIWYG.  Mostly it was the ideas they pioneered that<br>
have lived on, not their specific tools.  Englebart is still pushing<br>
his vision.  See:<br>
