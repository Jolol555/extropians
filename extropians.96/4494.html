Michael Lorrey said, "The day a spy agency like NSA gets such status and <br>
budget will be the beginning of the Second AMerican Civil War."<br>
<p>
The Second American Civil War is already well under way.  Millions of people <br>
are getting killed or taken as prisoners.  It is a war being fought in the <br>
streets of our cities, with  lots of civillian casualties.  For some, it is a <br>
cultural war, with certain cultures pushing their values on other cultures, <br>
doing their best to destroy those cultures.  For others, it is a war for <br>
economic gain, as they violently establish a monopoly on certain products, <br>
which they can then secretly sell, reaping huge profits.  For most, it is a <br>
war they have been trained to support, as their patriotic duty, kept unaware <br>
of the millions of wasted dollars and tortured lives that result froma this <br>
violent, costly and ultimately futile endeavor.  <br>
<p>
The Second American Civil War is the 'War on Drugs'.  The war is one waged <br>
upon peaceful, innocent civilians by powerlusting warmongers.  Their stated <br>
objective will never be reached; that war was lost as soon as it was begun.  <br>
But every day that the war continues, the Drug Warriors continue to more <br>
firmly establish their power and confiscate more and more money from peaceful, <br>
productive people.  Their real objective, to increase their own power and <br>
"wealth", is being met quite effectively by the War on Drugs.  They do not <br>
really want to get rid of drugs -- then they would be out of a very lucritive <br>
job.  <br>
<p>
The Drug Warrior parasites have no interest in actually helping the American <br>
people solve the many serious problems associated with the use of certain <br>
drugs.  If they did, they would not keep trying the same failed approach <br>
decade after decade, causing the drug problems to become even worse than they <br>
ever were.  The Drug Warriors point to the serious problems they have caused <br>
(neglecting to mention *that*, of course) and thus trick the American People <br>
into giving them even more money and power to pretend like they're working on <br>
the problem as hard as they can, but only making things worse for everyone but <br>
themselves.  Meanwhile, they're lining their pockets and their buddies' <br>
pockets with lots of money and worming themselves into positions of greater <br>
influence, perhaps getting some perverted thrill watching the cops chase poor <br>
people with psychological and medical problems, often beating them and locking <br>
them in cages to be raped and beaten by violent animals for several years, <br>
with no escape from the sickening nightmare -- needing medical and <br>
psychological help for their drug problems, but only getting torture.<br>
<p>
Americans are in the midst of a very serious, very violent War.  People are <br>
getting killed.  People are getting chased, beaten and hauled off to prisons <br>
to be tortured, their anguish hidden from the public, creating the illusion <br>
that things aren't really as bad as they are.  The American Government is <br>
waging a war against it's own citizens.  It has nothing to do with solving the <br>
serious drug problems many people have -- the appropriate solution to that is <br>
a medical / psychiatric one, not warfare.  <br>
<p>
The profound insanity of the War on Drugs is becoming more apparant every day, <br>
and I believe it is only a matter of time until the majority of Americans come <br>
to a full realization of the atrocities committed in their own neighborhoods <br>
and begin to adamantly refuse to finance such violence with their taxes.  It <br>
is in our interest to inform others of the real situation, so that a quick end <br>
is brought to the nightmare we call 'The War on Drugs'.<br>
