<p>
Yeah but what about the adrenal, insulin, thyroid and other hormonal<br>
governors on the metabolism? If you could use drugs to regulate the<br>
levels of such regulators, you could do a controlled metabolic rate<br>
reduction at the same time you drop their temperature down to 40 deg F<br>
or so. I've seen  the effects of the body's natural hypothermic "dive"<br>
response as being a big saver in cases of people falling into lakes and<br>
such.<br>
<p>
The<br>
<i>&gt; major problem with hypothermia is that various biological reaction rates</i><br>
<i>&gt; decrease with temperature by very different rates. The relationship of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these rates is optimal for human life at or just below (sometimes just</i><br>
<i>&gt; above) normal body temperature, 37'C. The only other boundary point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature at which the human body is viable over a long timespan is below</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "glass transition" temperature of the cryoprotectant cocktail/tissue</i><br>
<i>&gt; mixture. A "safe" value for this temperature is -140'C.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree this sounds great, but unfortunately reality doesn't always help</i><br>
<i>&gt; with our bright ideas of what the world could and should be like. No such</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanism of suppression exists and the work of trying to find one (with</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the different biochemical processes taking place in the body) would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an enormously greater problem (most likely not solvable) than finding a</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole-body reversible vitrification protocol. </i><br>
<p>
I guess I just see use of such blunt raw force approaches as being not<br>
as "unreliable" or easy on the patient. I mean what is the quality of<br>
life going to be for someone who has to grow back 75% of their body (or<br>
the whole thing for those who just have their head frozen)? WHile it may<br>
be cheaper to freeze someone at the start, what are the costs going to<br>
be at the other end to revive the person, and then rebuild them?<br>
<p>
This last job is basically<br>
<i>&gt; just technological hunting. If it can be done (and the design space of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryoprotectants -- even of untried combinations -- is very large), not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of "fundamental" research should be required. That is the reason why</i><br>
<i>&gt; the project is as "inexpensive" as it is (compared with more fundmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; open-ended research) and why a time-to-completion can be estimated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sure, because they don't need to. Do we know how they can stay under</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that long? if so this should be used as a safe interim solution for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;doubling or tripling terminal patients life expectancy by repeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;hybernations with interim waking periods for refueling etc...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This has been looked into. In my opinion it would require a genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; supplementation of human DNA with the appropriate animal DNA to produce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; neccessary anti-ice crystal proteins and anti-freeze chemicals when</i><br>
<i>&gt; prompted by some triggering agent. In any case, doubling or tripling a 6</i><br>
<i>&gt; months life expectancy period for a terminal patient, simply isn't going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; cut it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
True, in many cases, but I would think that it should be developed for<br>
people waiting for organ transplants, or waiting for FDA approval of<br>
certain possible cures. I would guess that this sort of therapy could<br>
become a widely used strategy for the hundreds of thousands of people<br>
worldwide who are waiting for organs....<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will ask my friend Steve Harris, MD about this, but I'm pretty certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; this must be an exaggeration. Yes, extreme hypothyroidism can slow down</i><br>
<i>&gt; many bodily processes, but it can kill you too, because it, again, does so</i><br>
<i>&gt; unevenly with respect to different body systems. And you still have to eat</i><br>
<i>&gt; and eliminate waste, and the institutional care costs would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; astronomical. One of the benefits of suspended animation will be that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will allow more people who can't afford enormously costly operations (often</i><br>
<i>&gt; of only of short-term benefit) to be, less expensively, sent into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future where their problems can be cheaply and easily fixed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I guess I just look at the freezing concept as being really a one way<br>
trip, like I really don't have any faith in John Clarks flash uploading<br>
ideas either. I prefer gradual uploading and soft, failsafe hybernation<br>
techniques.<br>
