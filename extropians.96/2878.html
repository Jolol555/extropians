The following appeared on the list this afternoon (i.e. Monday):  <br>
<p>
:: :: How? <br>
::<br>
:: Cancel that question.  You were just saying that as far as the <br>
:: Bekenstein Bound is concerned, one could store megabytes of data in a <br>
:: hydrogen atom; that's why the bound is "loose."  <br>
::<br>
:: I have a fever tonight. <br>
::<br>
:: Lyle <br>
<p>
Please understand that this was written Saturday night, a few hours <br>
after my original post in which I asked "How?"  I realized that I had <br>
missed the point and I wanted to retract the question before anyone <br>
responded.  I don't know why it took a day and a half for the post to <br>
appear.  There is also a resend which may appear eventually.  <br>
<p>
Thanks to Forrest Bishop, Anders Sandberg, and John Clark for their <br>
comments.  <br>
<p>
