I have two ideas that could possibly mean an afterlife from the individual's<br>
perspective. Try to debunk these for me.<br>
<p>
1. Taking a idea off the omega point theory where the last few seconds of<br>
the universe seem like forever, what if people dying experience pleasure and<br>
colors (like people dead for 24 hours) but experience this feeling for<br>
hundreds of years from their perspective much like certain drugs and slow<br>
down your perception of time. This would enable an afterlife in their minds.<br>
<p>
2. Taking a idea off the many worlds theory, what if the person only dies<br>
from our vantage pointor universe. If I am correct, every decision i make,<br>
I'm jumping through universes. So the person could appear to have died in<br>
our universe but from their vantage point they're still alive going on with<br>
their life.<br>
