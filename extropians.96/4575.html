[Warning: I am no physicist, and what I am about to write is based on<br>
some general reading many years ago.]<br>
<p>
One thing to realize about the sun is that it generates energy based<br>
on hydrogen fusion, unlike our own fusion bombs which use deuterium<br>
and tritium.  Hydrogen is much harder to make fuse, which is why we<br>
don't use it.<br>
<p>
The sun is very large, of course, and so its volume to surface ratio<br>
is huge.  All the energy generated in the fusion region in the interior<br>
ultimately has to escape through the surface.  But really, considering<br>
how big the sun is, the surface is not all that hot.  The sun's energy<br>
generation is quite inefficient by our standards.<br>
<p>
The interior of the sun is very hot and very dense, which is what allows<br>
hydrogen fusion to occur.  Each small region receives a flux of photons<br>
from its neighbors, and adds to it with its own energy generation.  As<br>
we move outward into cooler areas, the photons continually carry heat<br>
from the center, which will eventually be radiated to the surface.  But<br>
within the interior they are largely trapped, being absorbed and re-<br>
radiated, with more photons added all the time.  This keeps everything<br>
hot even though the actual rate of energy production is rather modest<br>
in some sense.<br>
<p>
I have read that the power generated by a human-sized region of the sun<br>
is approximately equal to that radiated by a bathtub full of warm water.<br>
This refers to the excess energy generated by that region due to hydrogen<br>
fusion, over the already-huge amounts of energy being received due to<br>
radiation from adjoining areas.  This is a tiny, tiny excess, and it is<br>
only because the sun is so huge that it adds up to a considerable amount<br>
of energy by our standards.<br>
<p>
So the only reason the sun is able to fuse hydrogen at all is because it<br>
is so hot and so dense, and the only reason it stays so hot is because it<br>
is relatively opaque to radiation so it traps most heat in the interior<br>
and allows it to leak out relatively slowly.  Presumably it became hot in<br>
the first place due to compressive heating when it was formed.  Bodies too<br>
small to form the high temperatures and densities needed never initiate<br>
hydrogen fusion, and then when they cool their chance is lost for good.<br>
<p>
This should make it clear how difficult it would be to turn Jupiter into<br>
a star.  Even if we set off a small fusion explosion in its interior,<br>
that would only heat up a limited local area.  While this might initiate<br>
some local hydrogen fusion, the heat production from that reaction is<br>
so modest that it could not heat up adjoining regions to the temperatures<br>
needed.  Hydrogen fusion is just too inefficient and slow.<br>
