Recently my father went to the store to purchase a box of Legos for my<br>
little brother who has recently become interested in the Cowboys &amp; Indians<br>
theme but we found no indians. Sure it's pollitically correct to take out<br>
the Indians because they were slaughtered by the white men but thats not<br>
the point! It should not hold back private industry in any means. I'm not<br>
sure if Lego was taken to court to have the indians removed but if so this<br>
shouldn't be. A while back during the coldwar I played a game called<br>
Russian Attack where you were an American going around mowing down russians<br>
with a machine gun. While politically incorrect nowadays that shouldn't<br>
limit a product from being put on the marketplace. Remember freedom of<br>
expression isn't for protecting the words we like, it's for protecting the<br>
words we dislike (I got the quote right, right?). Would you try to stop a<br>
Lego set that was a little Nazi camp with miniature gas chambers or is that<br>
censorship even if the product sold? The question is: are you conservative<br>
or should the free market have it's way. In protection of freedom of<br>
expression I might allow a lego set like that to thrive on the market even<br>
though I wouldn't personally agree with it. There is a VERY fine line here.<br>

 awake and do them."<br>
