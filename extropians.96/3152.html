regrow brain cells.&gt;<br>

I'm no expert on this but from what I've heard, crows are one of the most <br>
intelligent bird species. I recall a story about a crow watching a human <br>
who was ice fishing, saw that the person only checked the line when the red <br>
flag on it popped up, and proceeded to wait til the flag popped up and <br>
'reeled' in the line with its beak to steal the fish before the human <br>
noticed.<br>

*If* crow brains are not much bigger than other bird brains, what makes <br>
them so much smarter than other birds?<br>
