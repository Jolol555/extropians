Great post from James Rogers.  Filled with keen observations, and a<br>
remarkably objective analysis from someone who was there.  I have seen<br>
evidence of each of these points in my dealings with the Federal<br>
Communications Commission.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Some people on the list, such as Davin Enigl and James Rogers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;seem to have had extensive experience with federal agencies.  Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;we should get some input from them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In my experience with federal agencies (and having worked for federal</i><br>
<i>&gt;agencies), the people who work there aren't nice because they don't have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be nice.  Being nice has no impact on their jobs.  Unfortunately, many</i><br>
<i>&gt;federal employees are under the impression that citizens REQUIRE their</i><br>
<i>&gt;services, often leading to a small power trip for the federal worker</i><br>
<i>&gt;involved.  From my own personal experiences, I can tell you that being nice</i><br>
<i>&gt;or pleasant in no way impacts a federal employees job performance appraisal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Showing up to work is about the only requirement, and even that is kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;fuzzy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And another thing:  People work for federal agencies because they are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;capable or competent enough to get a job in the private sector.  The people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who work for the government are from the bottom of the barrel.  Anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt;is any good quits and works for the private sector.  This is the reason I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't work for DoD any more.  What happens is you get a concentration of</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who would *never* cut it in the private sector.  The federal</i><br>
<i>&gt;government is the employer of last resort.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And yet another reason:  People are promoted based on seniority, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;qualification.  The cream does not rise to the top in the federal government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;And people wonder why so many government agencies are mismanaged.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That said, there are a few agencies in the government who have their act</i><br>
<i>&gt;together, but they are far and few between.  I think many government</i><br>
<i>&gt;employees need to be reminded that they work for *us*.</i><br>
