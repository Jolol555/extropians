<i>&gt; &gt; A techno-elite will arise in *any* scenario.  And I, for one, don't see </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything wrong with that</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that's either a defeatist, fatalistic or impassionate attitude to</i><br>
<i>&gt; hold. And apart from that we have to make shure that there will not be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; too small elite as it will stop the exponential growth.</i><br>
<p>
That is an interesting problem. If we assume that growth currently is <br>
technological growth, then a small elite *may* be able to continue it <br>
anyway! Once the limiting factor of growth was food, but thanks to more <br>
advanced technology just one or two percent of people in the industrial <br>
countries are farmers; they produce enough food for the rest (and usually <br>
more than that, causing pricing problems). Today we are seeing how a <br>
relatively small group of people are able to do the industrial production <br>
needed to sustain society. It might be possible that in the future a <br>
small "elite" is enough to sustain technological growth (one might even <br>
argue that this has always been true). <br>
<p>
As for whether elites will appear in any scenario, I think it depends a <br>
lot on how much people communicate. As soon as barriers to communication <br>
appear, be they social or technological, then elites become tenable. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The world of knowledge as of now, is very disorganised with lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt; redundancy. The amount of information in science is increasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; exponentially also. Soon no one can hold the amount of information, The</i><br>
<i>&gt; same experiments and calculations will be developed several times at once</i><br>
<i>&gt; because no one can find any information. We have to develop ways to embedd</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge in systems so the amount of disorganised information won't stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; development. We have to develop applications that make use of all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; information with an easy interface.  This embedded knowledge will/must help</i><br>
<i>&gt; others to become part of the development instead of wellfare cases.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That way the info gap won't be to big and development will be speeded up.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with this, but I don't think it will prevent the gap from forming.<br>
Why? Because to become part of the development you must want to become<br>
part. And we are seeing a growing number of people with learned<br>
helplessness that will not actively seek knowledge or growth. With the<br>
above system, more people who otherwise might had become passive will be<br>
"saved", but it won't help a large group of people.  The only way to deal<br>
with them is to find ways of reversign their learned helplessness. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Actually, I am considering ways of inspiring the "masses" to become </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; techno-elites themselves.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we are just splitting semantics. If the masses become a techno elite,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there will no longer be an elite. Of course there will allways be somebody</i><br>
<i>&gt; with more talent than others. And that will automatically create an elite. </i><br>
<p>
There might also exist several techno-elites. Assume that the above<br>
knowledge-integration doesn't take place. Then technology and science<br>
could diverge into mutually incomprehensible areas, with plenty of<br>
redundancies and reinventing of the wheel. The Russian elite can't<br>
understand the technobabble of the American elite, and *nobody*<br>
understands the Fullerists. <br>
