<p>
Be careful with the "phylogeny recapitulates ontology" idea, it is not <br>
strictly true. But on the other hand, we *are* apes, and our behavior <br>
isn't that different from our cousins. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Schoolyard bullies exihibit classic alpha male behaviors, and enforce</i><br>

<p>
This form of selection is very out of fashion among evolutionary <br>
biologists today. Note that if it was true, then alpha males would *kill* <br>
inferior individuals, or at least expunge them from the group. This don't <br>
happen.<br>
<p>
What we see is the establishment of a typical primiate pecking order, with<br>
an alpha male at the top, beneath him a few liutenants (that some day may<br>
become his competitors), and then a social ladder down to the pecking<br>
chicken. Compare this to the structure of a normal corporation for an<br>
amusing/chilling similarity. At least among humans there exist an escape<br>
from this social order, the office of shaman/holy madman/fool:  just<br>
outside the group, accepted and still not accepted, so different that<br>
social status cannot be applied, necessary because he possesses skills<br>
with dealing with the "supernatural". Compare this with the classical<br>
image of the hacker. <br>
<p>
Your explanation doesn't explain why we have a "stupidity culture"; that<br>
high social status becomes correlated with strength is obvious, but why<br>
can't we have strong *and* smart alpha males? As it is now, intelligence <br>
either decreases status (perhaps as a defense reaction?) or pushes <br>
individuals into the shaman direction (perhaps because that is a safe <br>
place to be smart in). <br>
<p>
I wonder if the stupidity culture is very old. That people who are<br>
different are mistrusted has been true for all of history, but since when<br>
are smart people seen as different? I wonder if this isn't a very recent<br>
phenomenon, perhaps even post-WW II. <br>
