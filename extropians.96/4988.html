Yes, even if everyone had a Quantum Computer in their pocket we could still <br>
communicate privately because there is a way to make Cryptography as secure as <br>
the laws of Physics, and the really amazing thing is that it's practical too.<br>
Recently 2 banks exchanged financial information with Quantum Cryptography <br>
through a cable under Lake Geneva. The idea is to use Quantum Cryptography to <br>
send a One Time Pad of numbers to the person you want to talk to, the message <br>
can be detected but NOT without you knowing it was detected.  With a random <br>
One Time Pad you can generate a perfect encryption scheme, even if to <br>
everybody's surprise it turns out that P=NP, even if your opponent has a <br>
quantum computer, even if your opponent has a computer of infinite power, <br>
he can never read your message. Despite its perfect security it has severe <br>
practical limitations, how do you distribute the One Time Pad to the person <br>
you want to talk with? You can't send the pad electronically, if your <br>
electronic channel is not secure then an eavesdropper can tap your line and <br>
get a copy of the pad, if your channel is already secure then you don't need <br>
the pad. The only secure method is to  physically hand a disk with the pad on <br>
it to the person you want to talk to and then hand him another one when that <br>
one gets used up. That's not practical in most cases, what is practical is to <br>
use Quantum Cryptography, and unlike Quantum Computers we know for sure this <br>
will work because it's already been done.<br>
This is how:<br>
<p>
I send you a bunch of photons, each photon is polarized in one of 4 <br>
directions, horizontal, vertical, left-diagonal and right diagonal, - | \ / . <br>
In this example I send you 10 photons polarized as follows <br>
<i>| | / - - \ - | - / .</i><br>
<p>
You have a polarization detector, you can set your detector to measure the <br>
horizontal and vertical photons (+) OR you can set it to measure the <br>
left-diagonal and right diagonal photons (x). The laws of physics do not <br>
allow you to measure one photon both ways, because measuring one destroys all <br>
information about the other.<br>
<p>
You set your detector at random, let's say you set it to find rectilinear <br>
photons and let's say you have guessed correctly and it really is a <br>
rectilinear photon. If you can detect the photon after it passes through your <br>
polarized material, you will correctly deduce that it is a horizontal photon. <br>
If you can not detect a photon after it hits your polarizing material you <br>
will correctly deduce that the photon is vertical.<br>
<p>
What if you guessed incorrectly when you set your detector, what if you set <br>
it to detect a rectilinear photon but I send you a diagonal polarized photon? <br>
Then the photon will hit your polarizing material at a 45 degree angle so <br>
there is a 50% chance the photon will get through, a 50% chance it will not. <br>
In other words you get a random result.<br>
<p>
I send you 10 photons polarized as follows               | | / - - \ - | - /  <br>
At random you set your polarization detector as follows  x + + x x x + x + + <br>
So you might claim the photons were polarized as follows / | - \ / \ - / - |<br>
 <br>
Now you tell me over an insecure channel how you set your detector for each <br>
photon, Big Brother is free to listen in, it won't help him. I tell you over <br>
the same channel which settings on you polarization detector were correct, in <br>
this example settings number 2,6,7 and 9 were correct    * | * * * \ - * - *<br>
We only use those readings and junk the others, and we agree that horizontal <br>
and right diagonal photon means 1, and vertical and left diagonal means 0. <br>
So we have sent the number 0011 and we can be as certain as we want to be <br>
that there has been no eavesdropping.<br>
<p>
An eavesdropper can not know what type of photon is being sent, and just like <br>
you must guess what direction to set his polarization detector. He will be <br>
wrong 50% of the time and when he is he will change the polarization of the <br>
photon and give himself away. We compare N bits in the string of numbers <br>
sent over an insecure channel, if there are no discrepancies then there is <br>
only one chance in 2^N that somebody is eavesdropping, so we can use the <br>
remaining bits as a one time pad. As I said this  has already been done and <br>
messages have been sent about 35 miles in this way. I learned about this <br>
stuff mostly from Bruce Schneir's wonderful book  "Applied Cryptography".<br>
