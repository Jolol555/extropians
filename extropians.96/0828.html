 I agree with Eugene. If the &gt;H are nice enough to let us live, it will<br>
 probably be in VR. They won't want us using up a lot of resources in the<br>
 "real" world and they would probably be a bit squeamish about letting us<br>
fool<br>
 around at that level of reality, like letting a monkey run around in an<br>
 operating room. They'll probably want a firewall to protect themselves from<br>
 our stupidity.<br>

         That is very clever! If we are bad they won't let us live, but they<br>
might let us virtually live ... hmmm, that raises some interesting<br>
anthropological questions, don't you think? Would we be "prisoners?"  Maybe<br>
if we were REALLY good VR models, they might let us go back into RR - it<br>
reminds me of the show The Prisoner - every time he tried to leave the<br>
village.....<br>
