I knew what I was letting myself in for when I made the reference to<br>
sacred cows without giving the slightest hint of a justification.<br>
However, I decided that I would risk it, because to go over old ground<br>
would open old wounds and be entirely negative.  The response from the<br>
list was undeservedly generous, I thought! :-)<br>
<p>
It's nice to see several people openly invite the exorcism though.<br>
I'm still hesitant about whether revisiting the issues involved would<br>
be more enlightening than damaging.  As it happens, a few of you pulled<br>
some minor cows out from under the carpet without any coaxing, which<br>
I suppose is good.<br>

<p>
Excellent! :-)  [The experience of the transhuman list may indicate the<br>
opposite though:  people are too polite to hunt with impunity, so it<br>
doesn't happen and the cows continue grazing.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One obvious sacred cow you have seems to be that you don't have any; try </i><br>

<p>
Hardly.  I have the Mother of all Cows, and I've institutionalized her<br>
by the simple strategem of making her axiomatic in TransIndividualism.<br>
I don't need to imagine having views that I cannot question;  I have.<br>
This does at least have the benefit that the bovine sanctity is overt<br>
rather than covered up by handwaving justifications.  It goes without<br>
saying that I also have a zillion others cows around the place as well,<br>
no doubt.  It's a veritable farm, but I should also say that compared<br>
to some it is barely a window-box, because I almost completely discard<br>
the bovine herds related to humanist value sets that are so common even<br>
on this list.  [Not a good topic at parties, I have found. :-)]<br>

<i>&gt; Of course, a more worrying possibility is that we take them for granted</i><br>

<i>&gt; you discussed extropianism with somebody and got angry at their</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments - sacred cows tend to hide near such sore spots.</i><br>
<p>
Yes!  This is very, very true.  Unexpected anger ==&gt; Sacred Cow Alert.<br>
