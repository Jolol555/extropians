The "triple point" of a compound is the temperature/pressure range that<br>
allows the existence of 3 of the 4 possible phases.  The "triple point" for<br>
water is well outside the range of what most organisms would call<br>
"comfortable" since the pressure is significantly below 1.0 atmosphere and<br>
the temperature is below the normal freezing point of water.<br>
<p>
This aside, I think you are generally correct.  Liquids generally have the<br>
smallest range of any phase.  For a system to take advantage of the unique<br>
properties of water, it requires that the system be well suited for the<br>
semi-perpetual existence of liquid water.  Ice isn't conducive to life and<br>
very hot water/steam is extremely destructive to organic compounds.<br>
