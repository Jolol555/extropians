Other Extropians have raised the same possibility, so it's not fair to<br>
suggest that all Extropians are "dogmatic atheists" in the sense of<br>
absolutely rejecting the possibility that "god" -- in some usages of the<br>
word -- may have created our universe. Hans Moravec has written about this<br>
possibility, and others of us have discussed it.<br>
<p>
You go from saying that it's a *possibility* to saying that it's probable. I<br>
disagree with this. As I noted before, the hypothesis does *not* explain<br>
anything. It adds to the number of things to be explained. It's simply a<br>
speculation. The only value I can see in it, apart from simple intellectual<br>
fun, is that suggested by Hans Moravec in the interview I did with him in<br>
the November issue of Rage: it offers one way to escape the end of our<br>
universe. He says that a very long term, low-probability project is to try<br>
to discover ways of communicating with the makers of the universe. (BTW, why<br>
do you talk of "God" rather than "gods". Surely the creation of a universe<br>
is at least as likely to be a team effort.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can't see any way to put this *possibility* out of my mind.  And don't </i><br>

<i>&gt;already.  *Think* about what I have written, and respond out of intelligence, </i><br>
<i>&gt;not out of dogmatic habit.</i><br>
<p>

                        ^^^^^<br>
<p>
Which position are you actually taking, David? Is it merely possible -- a<br>
pure speculation with no evidence to support a positive belief, as you seem<br>
to originally suggest -- or likely? If the latter, I don't see that you've<br>
given a good argument.<br>
