I first joined the (original) Extropians list in August, 1991.  So I<br>
think the list must be at or near its five year old birthday.<br>
<p>
Today I was reading some of the very old posts.  Max suggested here<br>
recently that we could repost some of those old messages, and I think I<br>
may do so tomorrow (don't have my archives available now).<br>
Coincidentally, my first posting was about the book "The Big Bang Never<br>
Happened", now being discussed in the "Big Bang and Extropy" thread.<br>
<p>
One thing I found interesting was a message from Max about the Extropian<br>
Principles.  At that time Intelligent Technology and Spontaneous Order<br>
were not present.  Instead there was Cooperative Diversity, which I think<br>
was intended to get across a similar idea as SO.  In fact maybe in some<br>
ways that is a better term since as was pointed out here in some sense<br>
everything that happens (non-miraculously) in the world is spontaneous,<br>
hence governments can be thought of as examples of spontaneous order.<br>
