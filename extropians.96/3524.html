I would definitely. The problem with energy that is at such an entropy<br>
state is that its at the bottom of the potential barrel. Sure theres a<br>
LOT of it down there, but its still down there rather than up here.<br>
<p>
However, as you said, the biggest brains have no idea right now of how<br>
to use it, while crackpots run around claiming breakthroughs galore that<br>
they can never prove. The effect I am using in my device has been<br>
demonstrated to work by others. I also have an expanded description on<br>
my <a href="http://www.tpk.net/~retroman/Lorreydr.htm">http://www.tpk.net/~retroman/Lorreydr.htm</a> of a vector analysis<br>
showing how it achieves its performance. It is rather simplified for<br>
anyone to understand. WHat did you think of the multiphasic x-axis<br>
output chart I put up here?<br>
<p>
Unlike many I am willing to show others, as that is the only way I'm<br>
gonna bring in the bucks, so long as others are willing to keep my<br>
secrets. Anyone can download my nondisclosure agreement, complete it,<br>
and send it with the required materials to my office. <br>
<p>
If you can show my stuff to some people at Lockeed that are willing to<br>
check it out, I would really appreciate it....<br>
