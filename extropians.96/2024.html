It would be great if everybody was empowered enough to afford to sell <br>
their labour to whoever has better working conditions, but the case is <br>
that people have to work in appalling conditions just to survive.<br>
If everybody was treated with mutual respect in libertarianism then it <br>
would succeed, but that is the case with any form of government or lack <br>
thereof. If everybody had the relationship that you do with your <br>
tutorees, then it would be great. That's not the case. In anarchism, <br>
everybody wants to be free, correct, then why should someone be able to <br>
force others to work for them, by offering them the "choice", between <br>
starvation and slavery.<br>
