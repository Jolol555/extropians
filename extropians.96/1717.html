Regarding David Musick's essay questioning the widely-held assumption that<br>
state-sponsored law is the only tool to address violence and other social<br>
problems, below is the better part of an essay I've written about extropian<br>
approaches to law (at <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exlaw.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exlaw.html</a>):<br>
<p>
Extropians look to the concept of law as a powerful tool in building a better<br>
future.  As with every other aspect of their own lives and society, however,<br>
they question the current state of the law and legal thinking, look for the<br>
best in the past and the present and seek to develop new modes of thinking<br>
and acting to transcend bounds that others may accept without doubt.<br>
<p>
Individual liberty and reciprocity are the highest values in an extropian<br>
approach to law and legal issues.  These values follow naturally from a<br>
desire for self transformation and a stress on social systems that arise as a<br>
spontaneous ordering of free individuals.  Accordingly, extropians look to<br>
legal systems as tools for freely ordering their own lives and their<br>
interactions with others and they resist the use of law as a tool of<br>
repression or coercion.<br>
<p>
Extropians strongly question the presumption underlying the current almost<br>
universal paradigm of law that assumes that law is inextricably intertwined<br>
with the power of the state.  They seek to free the law from this confining<br>
assumption as much as possible and see the law more as a fluid ground of<br>
action for ordering the affairs of individuals on a consensual basis.  Thus,<br>
extropians are interested in current developments in various regimes of<br>
so-called "privately produced law", such as private mediation and<br>
arbitration, and look forward to the possibility of expanding the reach of<br>
such regimes of private law to new areas of human activity.  Many extropians<br>
think that the coercive state as we know it today could be more or less<br>
completely replaced by "polycentric legal codes" of privately produced law,<br>
an example of spontaneous order on the largest social scale.<br>
<p>
Individual responsibility is the necessary corollary of the extropian stress<br>
on individual liberty.  Thus extropians do not look to rights granted by an<br>
impersonal state, but rather the free acceptance of responsibility for the<br>
consequences of individual and collective action, coupled with reasoned and<br>
explicit reciprocity, as the best basis for ordering human (and posthuman)<br>
affairs through law.<br>
