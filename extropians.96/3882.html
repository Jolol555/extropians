An article in today's New York Times describes a long-awaited <br>
breakthrough:  a computer program has proved a difficult conjecture <br>
that mathematicians have been unable to prove.  <br>
 <br>
The Times does not describe the conjecture (now a theorem) in detail;    <br>
it is merely described as the statement that "a set of three equations is <br>
equivalent to a Boolean algebra."  It was proposed by Herbert Robbins  <br>
in the 1930s.  Robbins could not prove his conjecture.  He showed it to <br>
Professor Albert Tarski, a well-known logician at Stanford.  According   <br>
to the article, "Dr. Tarski, who is now dead, worked on the problem, <br>
included it in a book, and handed it out to graduate students and visitors."  <br>
<p>
In other words, this is not a "toy" problem.  It has been worked on by <br>
numerous mathematicians of high ability.  However, it is not exactly a <br>
problem in the mainstream of mathematics; it is on the fringe between <br>
mathematics proper and mathematical logic.  <br>
<p>
Now the theorem has been proved by an automated reasoning program <br>
written by Bill McCune at the Argonne National Laboratory.  <br>
<p>
According to the Times, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Finally, on Oct. 2, Dr. McCune gave the Robbins conjecture to </i><br>
<i>&gt; a new automated reasoning program that he had written called EQP, </i><br>
<i>&gt; for equational prover.  Eight days later, on Oct. 10, the computer </i><br>
<i>&gt; spewed out a proof.  Dr. McCune, a low-key researcher, said he was </i><br>
<i>&gt; "amazed."  Dr. Larry Wos, his supervisor, said "Bill was in heaven."  </i><br>
<p>
I used to correspond with these people (there is a list devoted to <br>
automated reasoning), so I know a little more about it than the Times <br>
reports.  It should be noted that <br>
<p>
1.  It is one thing to prove a theorem about Boolean algebra, and <br>
something else to prove a theorem about complex analysis.  <br>
<p>
2.  The program was given a conjecture to prove.  The program didn't <br>
think up the conjecture itself.  <br>
<p>
3.  There is nothing recursive about this -- in other words, the programs <br>
don't write the next generation of programs.  All programming is done <br>
by humans.  Larry Wos, Bill McCune and their colleagues aren't trying <br>
to write programs that write programs.  That's not even on their agenda <br>
at this point.  <br>
<p>
4.  Instead of trying to get the program to prove theorems all by itself, <br>
it would be much more useful to build a mathematician's workbench, <br>
i.e. a program that would do the same thing for mathematicians that a <br>
text editor does for programmers, a word processor does for writers, <br>
a CAD program does for engineers, etc.    IA instead of AI.  <br>
