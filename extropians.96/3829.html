<i>&gt;I must protest *strongly* against this line of thinking.  Although the</i><br>
<i>&gt;content can be pretty much free-form, THE SOFTWARE MUST ADHERE TO STRICT,</i><br>
<i>&gt;ORGANIZED,  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS.  Without a solid, capable software</i><br>
<i>&gt;substrate to orchestrate the environment and resources, the operation of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world itself will be chaotic and unreliable.  All inter-user communications</i><br>
<i>&gt;should be done using communications facilities and resources built into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;system.</i><br>
<p>
Remember he meantioned that we should build stuff out of off the shelf<br>
tools so that we remain compatable with each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your "3D IRC chatchannel" is a perfect example.</i><br>
<p>
This is whats wrong with software such as WorldsChat or WorldsAway is that<br>
the chat environments are completely incompatable with each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not motivated by either artistic or financial incentives.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;motivated because it is an opportunity to do something groundbreaking and</i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting.  There are many different aspects to this project.  Sure, we</i><br>
<i>&gt;may all want to do our own thing, but if we have the same general goal then</i><br>
<i>&gt;we can still accomplish something.  And as I have mentioned before, *IF* we</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish what we have been discussing, there is a significant possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it could have significant financial rewards in the future.</i><br>
<p>
Quite possibly true. Sell tickets to visit the alife carnival and watch<br>
them do tricks :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It will probably require a powerful TCP/IP server engine coupled with a some</i><br>
<i>&gt;type of small, fast database engine.  A number of communications and</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction APIs will have to be built into the system to allow users to</i><br>
<i>&gt;build their own (Java?) software modules so that they can add their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;functionality and designs to the world without inadvertently hindering or</i><br>
<i>&gt;damaging the system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The entire world can then be built on top of this World engine.  What you do</i><br>
<i>&gt;and put in the world is completely up to the user in any fashion the user</i><br>
<i>&gt;chooses. The software must be a carefully detailed architecture, but the</i><br>
world does<br>
<i>&gt;not have to be.</i><br>
<p>
Stick to evolving VRML standards.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All the technologies used will be off-the-shelf:  Java, C/C++, TCP/IP, HTML,</i><br>
<i>&gt;VRML, etc. However, we may be forced to use these technologies in new and</i><br>
novel ways.<br>
<i>&gt;As I mentioned above, this project will almost surely require a custom</i><br>
<i>&gt;server engine.</i><br>
<p>
This will not be centralized. It will be ALL OVER the net! Even in personal<br>
FTP sites. People will place their .WLD VRML files on their personal FTP<br>
sites and people will teleport to them using teleporters from other<br>
transhuman/extropian realms. If the # of people accessing these WLD files<br>
grow, we can then move it to a server but by that time, bandwidth will be<br>
faster and data transfer rate per month restrictions for personal websites<br>
will be raised due to faster bandwidth. Remember, USR 56kbps modems over<br>
standard telco lines come out in JAN 97!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this project was so simple, someone would have done it</i><br>
<i>&gt;already.</i><br>
<p>
No because most people don't know how to use VRML tools or have machines<br>
fast enough to run VRML smoothly as well as time and effort.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I disagree.  The timeframe, depending on individual involvement, is</i><br>
<i>&gt;something more around a year.  And the appropriate technologies are</i><br>
<i>&gt;currently available.  Most of these technologies *are* considered bleeding</i><br>
<i>&gt;edge, but that should really be an incentive more than anything.  IF we were</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first people to successfully mature and develop these technologies, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would not only generate a lot of media coverage, </i><br>
<p>
Great way to spread memes too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but it could be very</i><br>
<i>&gt;profitable as well.  It would be extremely likely that other companies would</i><br>
<i>&gt;want us to use our techniques and technologies to develop worlds for them.</i><br>
<p>
Which is where the $$$ come in.<br>
