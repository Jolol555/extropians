about Innovations: business and academia and Automated Collaborative<br>
Filtering (ACF) agents for the Internet.<br>
<p>
Sorry, I don't have anything about business &amp; academia collaborations,<br>
although I did notice that Firefly was mentioned, among only about 3<br>
other companies working on ACF agents, in a recent (I think)<br>
Computerworld article.<br>
<p>
However, over the weekend I happened upon an article in my cache from a<br>
2/95 Communications of the ACM Technical Correspondence column "Remark<br>
About Self-Stabilizing Systems" by Xavier Debest of Hochheim, Germany<br>
that might be interesting for your development efforts.<br>
<p>
Debest uses a simple example of instructing children (or robots) to form<br>
a circle:<br>
<p>
"the quality (i.e., persistence) of the result directly depends on the<br>
sameness of the algorithm (or at least its goal) by all components ...<br>
these results [how to achieve stability with autonomous agents] apply to<br>
any system built from a significant number of components which are<br>
moving and evolving independently from one another, but which are<br>
cooperating or competing together to achieve some common goals ..."<br>
<p>
"In an environment where software applications are growing more and more<br>
distributed, where the end user gets more and more responsibility, and<br>
where the duration of the technological cycles is shrinking ... it is<br>
futile to try and enforce rigid development rules from the top ..."<br>
<p>
"In regard to the development of application software, the lessons<br>
learned from these experiments could be translated as follows: 1. Don't<br>
overspecify ... 2. Decrease the planning level of long-term activities<br>
... 3. Introduce a dynamic component in the planning of big projects ...<br>
4. Implement 'bottom up' from the existing upwards ... 5. Accept<br>
diversity; heterogeneity may be an asset ... 6. Use a goal (object-)<br>
oriented decomposition methodology."<br>
<p>
This is pretty-much accepted practice among software developers today,<br>
so it may not be all that useful.  Still, this seems to be useful advice<br>
for other types of futurists on this list as well.<br>
<p>
By the way, John Holland's recent book on complex adaptive systems, "The<br>
Hidden Order" is excellent if you haven't read it.<br>
<p>
******************<br>
Here's something else I found in my old notes that might be relevant or<br>
at least interesting for ACF and the list in general.<br>
<p>
11/02/94. MENTALITY MODES. In the Nov'94 Communications of the ACM,<br>
David Canfield Smith, developer of KidSim at Apple (a graphical system<br>
for programming by demonstration), responds to a letter criticizing his<br>
team for emphasizing visual interfaces to the detriment of language<br>
skills. The letter writer claims, "languages are built from words, not<br>
pictures. Admittedly, some major languages are written in picture form<br>
but the rest of the race considers that to be a severe disadvantage."<br>
Canfield says the letter "raises a valid question: do people think in<br>
images?" as opposed to words. Canfield cites Rudolf Arnheim's "landmark"<br>
1971 book, "Visual Thinking", which argues that words are primarily<br>
useful for (1) their ability to name and quickly distinguish similar<br>
objects, and (2) their adverbial and adjectivial quantification<br>
properties; in short, for helping to distinguish differences. But, for<br>
creative thinking and synthesis, visual imaging is more powerful.<br>
<p>
Canfield cites Albert Einstein, who described his mode of thought in a<br>
1945 survey ("The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field" by<br>
Jaques Hadamard) as follows: "The words of the language [digital state<br>
summaries] ... do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought.<br>
The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are<br>
certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily'<br>
reproduced and combined ... Conventional words or other signs have to be<br>
sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage."<br>
<p>
Canfield goes on to note: "The educational psychologist Jerome Brunner<br>
argues that people develop three mentalities or ways of thinking, which<br>
he labels enactive, iconic and symbolic." Canfield quotes from Brunner's<br>
1966 book, "Toward a Theory of Instruction": "Any domain of knowledge<br>
... can be represented in three ways: by a set of actions appropriate<br>
for achieving a certain result (enactive representation); by a set of<br>
summary images or graphics that stand for the concept without defining<br>
it fully (iconic representation); and by a set of symbolic or logical<br>
propositions drawn from a symbolic system that is governed by rules or<br>
laws for forming and transforming propositions (symbolic<br>
representation)."<br>
<p>
Recent object-oriented analysis methodologies seem to recognize this by<br>
defining dynamic, object and functional models for any system.<br>
<p>
In general, it seems to me that the more detailed one's knowledge of the<br>
world becomes, the more structured (and symbolic) it must be, with more<br>
categories. In order to successfully assimilate a greater variety of<br>
information, one's knowledge base is forced to take on a highly<br>
normalized relational structure, as opposed to the more hierarchical or,<br>
at a lower level yet, object-oriented knowledge bases of those less<br>
educated. But, while facilitating analysis and enabling a broader range<br>
of knowledge to be stored, the relational model imposes penalties when<br>
it comes to seeing trends and decision making because there are many<br>
more fragmented knowledge sources that must be joined to produce a<br>
useful synthesis.  Organizations are finding that 'multidimensional'<br>
databases, sitting 'on top' of the broader relational database, which<br>
"rely on a hierarchical structure, with sets of data feeding into higher<br>
levels of summary" are necessary for facilitating complex, ad hoc<br>
queries and spotting trends.<br>
<p>
In conclusion, it seems that mental development begins (in the infant)<br>
at the enactive level, proceeds to develop iconic representations of<br>
objects and actions (the toddling stage); and 'finally', acquires a<br>
detailed symbology or language for more precise and complex description<br>
of the world (the student stage). BUT, once the detailed language is in<br>
place for continual knowledge gathering, the mind then needs to work<br>
'backward': First, it must build up or extract new icons to represent<br>
more abstract, compound subjects; and then, it must simulate a<br>
cyberspace where these new icons can interact in an enactive manner.<br>
Most of us are able to extract new icons to various extents. However,<br>
the ability to simulate or visualize a higher level world for these new<br>
icons, like Einstein was able to do, is a much rarer skill, one that can<br>
often be inhibitted by the formal rules and constraints of the language<br>
we have previously worked so hard to acquire. Still, it must be<br>
recognized that each mode of thought has its advantages and<br>
disadvantages and all three must be integrated in order to form a<br>
complete and coherent 'picture'.<br>
