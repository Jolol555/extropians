<p>
A primitive version of one of my earlier designs was granted a patent to<br>
a gentlman by the name of Richard Lieurance on Feb6, 1996. His design is<br>
still a very basic mechanical version. Apparently it works enough to be<br>
granted a patent. I am applying for a patent for a couple of my advanced<br>
versions. I have not found anyone working on this concept to the level<br>
of sophistication I have, so I am reasonably secure in obtaining a<br>
patent on it.<br>
<p>
If you want to check this out, the listing and abstract is located at:<br>

<a href="http://fetch.cnidr.org/cgi-bin/patbib_fetch4?/pto7/NEW/INDEX+PATBIB-76-96+30357+0+20+10441+OF+193+38">http://fetch.cnidr.org/cgi-bin/patbib_fetch4?/pto7/NEW/INDEX+PATBIB-76-96+30357+0+20+10441+OF+193+38</a>6+30357+0+20+10441+OF+193+3834+151+propulsion<br>
<p>
Using the PTO links you can even get a copy of the patent online for I<br>
think a charge on your visa of like $3.00. <br>
<p>
I've talked to this gentleman's lawyer, as he is unreachable, and am<br>
awaiting further contact...<br>
<p>
I am interested in finding out if he is developing anything with it.<br>
It's funny, there happen to have been a slew of UFO sightings in this<br>
guys listed neighborhood recently..... ;)<br>
