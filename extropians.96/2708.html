<i>&gt; &gt; Suresh Naidu said, "The government was as short sighted as can be, as usual.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But the businesses are still the ones who dumped the waste."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would correct this statement, to make it more accurate.  It was *PEOPLE in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the businesses* who dumped the waste.  There were certain, specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individuals who dumped that waste, and the fact that they were business owners</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has as much relevance as their skin or eye color to the fact that they were so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unethical that they would do such a horrible thing.  These polluters are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; highly unethical people who HAPPEN to be business owners as well.  Being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business owners didn't *cause* them to be evil polluters.  Capitalism doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; CAUSE people to be unethical.  Yes, there are unethical people who trade in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the capitalist system who ALSO do very bad things, but to decry all of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capitalism and business because of the acts of a few assholes who fuck people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over is as stupid and irrational as being racist because one black guy attacks</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you and steals your clothes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Capitalism encourages people to be unethical. </i><br>
<p>
How so? Capitalism which is unresponsive to shareholders and consumers<br>
may be, but it is not a corporations job to teach that. Corporations<br>
tend to do background checks on new employees, and develop files on the<br>
integrity of the individuals. I would not hire someone who had<br>
demonstrated poor integrity in the past, as that person is also likely<br>
to steal from or take actions which may damage the company. <br>
<p>
The most unethical can be<br>
<i>&gt; the most profitable, althought this is not always the case, it happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; way too frequently. The amount of environmental damage one person</i><br>
<i>&gt; can do when he doesn't have total control over a large organization is far less.</i><br>
<p>
It took one drunk to cause the Alaska oil spill, and he wasn't an<br>
executive either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On his own he could pollute a small piece of land, as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; businessman he can destroy an entire ecosystem. Capitalism gives power to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the unethical so they can do more damage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Suresh, you're over-generalizing, BIG-TIME!  You're standing in the middle of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a battlefield, blowing away friend and enemy alike.  "The enemies are humans;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shoot the enemies.  All humans are enemies; shoot all humans"  is the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "The bad people who pollute and fuck people over are business people; stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them from committing their evil acts.  All business people are evil; stop all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; businesses."  Both are examples of very bad logic.  Yet this is exactly the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; logic you are using.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The bad people who pollute and fuck over people are the ones with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most power in capitalism. That's a method of getting rich, forfeiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethics in favour of profits. Thus, the ones who get power are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; unethical ones. You may call it pragmatic, but I call it nasty. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the logic I'm following: Profits can be earned by the nastiest methods</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible, thus the unethical  ones in society will accumulate the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; money, and thus power.</i><br>
<p>
Profits like that can only be earned in the short term. With free<br>
communication like the internet, it is much harder to hide such events,<br>
bringing ever more likely the swift retribution of a corporations'<br>
consuming customers. WIth government in charge, spills are a matter of<br>
"national security", and reporting such things is treason.<br>
<p>
Look at all the nuclear and chemical wasteland in Russia. you probably<br>
don't know about them, other than Chernobyl, but they are a whole lot<br>
worse than ANYTHING that has ever happened in the west, and that was by<br>
a PEOPLE's government.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While I acknowledge that not all business people are evil, some are</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorant of the effects their number crunching has on other people, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; some are trying to help, but don't know how to do it and remain</i><br>
<i>&gt; competitive. It's very hard to be nice and</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Check your thinking; you've got a bad meme in there somewhere, trying to take</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over your mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Find out what the REAL enemy is.  It's not business.  It's not even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; government.  There's something much deeper.  And until you understand the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sources of the world's problems, all your grand plans for society will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; misguided and ineffective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay, can you tell me??? If I find it I'll let you know. I really wish</i><br>
<i>&gt; there was some cabal of people (y'know, like the Roscrucians, Freemasons,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Illuminati, Communists, Capitalists, Muppets, Extropians) making</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world bad, then at least you could direct efforts to topple it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But I guess the fault lies with</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves, and all the failings currently being human entails. This isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; something you can fight without indoctorination or massive dosages of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Prozac(Television?).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason I advocate anarchy is because I hope it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; encourage the same principles of mutual aid that have helped us evolve to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this point, so we can develop into a species that will take itself to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; stars. &lt;ahhh, starry dreamy eyes&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (I hate vi)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know the real enemy is not big business. But they are a sore point in</i><br>
<i>&gt; society. The real enemy is .... RICHARD SIMMONDS(sorry...I'll take my</i><br>
<i>&gt; methadone). It sucks that people are sometimes rapacious, brutal and</i><br>
<i>&gt; savage,but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's why we need to keep power imbalances from happening, so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; nobody, regardless of how "benevolent", can dictate terms to anyone else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The last thing anybody wants is to have brutal people have power over you,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so the only way to prevent this from happening is to minimize the absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt; power anyone has over anybody else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's face it, any system would work if people were a bit "nicer".</i><br>
<p>
You are starting to get it. Free market IS anarchy. How decent our<br>
society is is only a matter of how decent its individual components<br>
(i.e. people) are, as it is sthe same with corporations.<br>
<p>
Monopolies of any kind only happen with government connivance and media<br>
acquiescence.<br>
<p>
If you join us in the fight to prevent both, you are on your way.....<br>
