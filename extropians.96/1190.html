IAN: I recall this. Obviously this FBI official knew better, he had <br>
to be aware of the fact that investigators were discovering many <br>
missile witnesses. Yet, the FBI official is at the same time sending <br>
a powerful "social signal" that "wrong thinking" is a sign of mental <br>
illness -- i.e., of the need for having one's "head examined." <br>
<p>
Right there we have an example of a source for the social ideation <br>
that serious questioning of the govt-line is a sign of mental illness, <br>
which in turn is a sign of perhaps the need of being locked up in the <br>
lunny bin. An idea not endirsed by the state = a sign of insanity.<br>
<p>
Such social ideation, which results in social alienation, is a <br>
powerful disincentive for independent investigation and questioning <br>
of authority. It's a Soviet style method of tarring anti-authoritarians <br>
as inherently insane, ergo: ignore them or at worst lock them up. It <br>
works very effectively, as almost anyone who's ever broached a <br>
conspiracy theory regarding govt activities can attest.<br>
