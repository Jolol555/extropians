I agree whole-heartedly with Eliezer -- the "masses" aren't stupid.  The sheer <br>
intelligence of the typical human is truly amazing to me.  The complex tasks <br>
they accomplish are quite phenomenal, especially when one considers trying to <br>
make a machine which is even close to being that intelligent.  Yes, some <br>
humans are slower than others at different tasks, and some humans are smarter <br>
than others, but all of us humans are pretty damn smart.  Some of us are a <br>
little ahead of others, but we're also ahead of our selves of a few years ago <br>
-- we *learned*, and I strongly believe the "masses" can learn too.  The human <br>
mind is extremely versatile and it adapts to changing situations very quickly. <br>
 The "masses" exemplify this very well.  The way new technologies have been so <br>
quickly accepted in this century, by the "masses" is evidence of that.<br>
<p>
The human race is learning at an astonishing rate, and the pace is quickening. <br>
 The "advanced" ideas we take for granted and intelligent ways of thinking <br>
we've adopted to make our lives better will be commonplace in a few years.  <br>
Some of us think we're so much smarter than the masses, but they're right <br>
behind us; we just happen to catch on a little quicker than most.  Consider <br>
your departure from "normality"; consider all the lessons you've learned and <br>
applied in your life that has made you a smarter, happier and more productive <br>
human.  You were raised in human culture, along with all the other "masses", <br>
yet you came across useful ways of thinking and living, which you have applied <br>
in your life.  You found ideas, which, once you considered them, seemed <br>
obvious and useful -- the ideas just made a lot of sense.  You stumbled on to <br>
the path of self-transformation and self-improvement, and right now, what <br>
you've learned  makes you more advanced than the typical human.  But it all <br>
came from *learning*.  Other people will see the ideas you saw, and they will <br>
make just as much sense to them as they did to you, and the people will adopt <br>
the good ideas just as eagerly as you did.<br>
<p>
These ideas, of self-transformation and self-improvement are spreading <br>
incredibly quickly through the culture.  Just go to a bookstore and see the <br>
*huge* self-help section!  Much of the advice in these books may be bullshit, <br>
but at least people are thinking about improving themselves, and there is such <br>
a huge demand for these kinds of books that thousands of authors are making a <br>
living off writing them.  All over the place, I see advertisements for <br>
seminars and lectures on self-improvement.  There is a huge demand for this.  <br>
By whom?  By the masses.  The masses want to improve themselves.  They are <br>
spending huge amounts of money to find someone to show them the way to do it.  <br>
I say, that's pretty Extropian of them.<br>
<p>
We, who currently identify ourselves as "Extropian", may be more intelligent <br>
than the typical human, but as far as I'm concerned, our intelligence is a <br>
skill we've learned, and it's something that the "masses" are learning.  I'm <br>
very pleased with the progress I see humans making.  Humans are smart.  And <br>
they are open to new ideas.  People want things to be better, and they *will* <br>
make intelligent choices.  It sometimes takes a little while, but the good <br>
ideas eventually *do* get adopted.  <br>

 -- The tradition of seeking better solutions and improving our situation is <br>
an ancient one.  I am proud to keep this tradition alive. --<br>
