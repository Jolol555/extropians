The following review appeared this month in the CMU staff newspaper:<br>
<p>
The Three Big Bangs: Comet Crashes, Exploding Stars, and the Creation of<br>
the Universe<br>
Philip M. Dauber and Richard A. Muller, Addison-Wesley 1996<br>

We are blessed to be living at a time of rapidly expanding understanding<br>
of the universe, and additionally blessed by the high quality of current<br>
science writing about this new understanding, aimed at an educated<br>
public that has proven to be remarkably eager to buy the new books. "The<br>
Three Big Bangs" by Dauber and Muller is an excellent example of a<br>
fascinating book that should be accessible to the educated<br>
non-scientist, yet also offers much to any scientist whose specialty<br>
lies outside the book's topics.<br>
<p>
The authors' three big bangs are 1) THE Big Bang thought to have given<br>
birth to the known universe, 2) the later explosions of supernovas which<br>
produced the heavy elements not originally present in the early<br>
universe, which was dominated by the light elements hydrogen and helium,<br>
and 3) the crash of a comet or asteroid near the Yucatan peninsula 65<br>
million years ago, which destroyed the dinosaurs and gave fresh<br>
opportunities to mammals and, eventually, to us humans. For the authors,<br>
these diverse events are linked because they have each played an<br>
enormous role in determining the nature of the world we now live in.<br>
<p>
These three big bangs give us a strong sense of physical evolution,<br>
comparable to the modern view of biological evolution. This is a new<br>
perception. When I was a child in the 1940's I read everything about<br>
popular astronomy I could get my hands on. The view I got at the time<br>
was of a completely static universe, in which nothing much ever<br>
happened. The universe was magnificent and awesome but certainly not<br>
dynamic. Now the universe is a place of explosive evolution and is<br>
vastly more magnificent and awesome. "The Three Big Bangs" tells this<br>
story well.<br>
<p>
A popular science book is often much more satisfying when written by an<br>
expert who can write for a general audience than when written by a<br>
journalist who is looking in from the outside. Both authors have done<br>
significant research in the areas that they discuss, and they also write<br>
well. Muller has been exceptionally inventive in designing and carrying<br>
out experiments in areas that seemed off the beaten track at the time. A<br>
few years ago the National Science Foundation gave Muller a prestigious<br>
award recognizing his unusual and unique scientific contributions. With<br>
what must have been enormous pleasure, he used his acceptance speech as<br>
an occasion to point out that he had been unable to get federal funding<br>
for much of his work because it was considered to be too risky and not<br>
sufficiently mainstream!<br>
<p>
"The Three Big Bangs" is a book that openly panders to our fascination<br>
with violence, but in a way that is socially acceptable. If you are a<br>
scientist, maybe some loved one will realize that they should buy it for<br>
you as a gift. If you are not a scientist, buy yourself a copy!<br>
