Ira Brodsky said:<br>
I would add one more thing to this list: hedonism.<br>
<p>
You can't conquer death (and everything else) if you are a slave to<br>
physical needs/desires.  As I recall, someone on this list (maybe it was<br>
Max More?) said they would not want to be uploaded to exist solely as<br>
intellect.  Why not?  Do you think if you achieved such an existence you<br>
would miss having physical needs/desires?  I doubt it.<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
There are a lot of rhetorical hooks packed into this.<br>
I dispute the equivalency of "hedonism" and "[being] a slave to <br>
physical needs/desires".<br>
<p>
I suspect I would not willingly permit myself to be uploaded to exist <br>
solely as intellect. <br>
<p>
I might permit myself to be copied into a fast intellect-only form<br>
(as a sort of "guardian angel") if it seemed as if a lot of people I <br>
don't know and hence might be wise not to trust were getting themsleves <br>
uploaded as pure intellects. But that would be so I could keep an eye on <br>
them and fight them on their own turf if need be. (1/2 grin) <br>
<p>
It's anybody's guess how I could keep my guardian angel interested <br>
in guarding me--I'd probably have to install something irrational like <br>
"loyalty" or "fondness" into it, and that might slow it down against <br>
some faster-on-the-draw "pure intellect". If so, bummer.<br>
<p>
You are free to doubt whatever you like; but GIGO. The notion that <br>
"physical needs/desires" is all there is to hedonism is fundamentally <br>
flawed when applied to this particular human. YMMV.<br>
