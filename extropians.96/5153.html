James Rogers raises some excellent questions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I may have misrepresented myself here.  I have no designs to control people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am trying to ascertain, based on what we know of memetics, to what</i><br>
<i>&gt;granularity a generalized (as opposed to individually targeted, e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt;deliberate brainwashing) meme can be focused.  In other words, is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;practically possible for a meme to propagate only within a very narrowly</i><br>
<i>&gt;defined segment of the population?  Say for example, a meme which only</i><br>
<i>&gt;propagates amongst white females, ages 34-37, who live in the Pacific</i><br>
<i>&gt;Northwest.</i><br>
<p>
I doubt it. I suspect the phenomena are simply too complex. Mental<br>
activity resembles cyclical turbulence in some ways, I think, and<br>
sociocultural mental activity would be a turbulence composed of<br>
turbulences. But I'm sure that you know a good deal more about<br>
turbulence than I do... what do you think of this metaphor?<br>
<p>
I do think that it's a vain hope that we will ever ascend to a<br>
stage in which our actions and words will no longer have any<br>
unintended consequences, and it is the unintended consequences that<br>
make the phrase "memetic engineering" something of a joke.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There does seem to be instances of fine grained memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;propagation occuring.  </i><br>
<p>
For instance?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am interested in the factors that control</i><br>
<i>&gt;susceptibility to memetic propagation.  What aspect of human cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;function is responsible for memetic susceptibility?  Some people seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;more susceptible than others (bandwagoneers? skeptics?).  </i><br>
<p>
I suspect that these questions are probably best researched within<br>
psychology, particularly the psychology of leadership, which is a<br>
mighty contentious field, lying as it does at the boundary between<br>
psychology and political philosophy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, would it be possible for a person to detect a meme carefully targeted</i><br>
<i>&gt;at ones self?</i><br>
<p>
Now *this* is a good question, except that it begs the question whether<br>
or not it is even possible to "carefully target" a meme at a particular<br>
individual in any kind of way that would allow objective testing of the<br>
results. I suspect that this question reduces to "Are there any methods<br>
by which we can avoid getting hoodwinked by people who are intimately<br>
familiar (either through long acquaintance or keen skills of<br>
psychological observation) with our individual psychological structure?"<br>
And of course that's an interesting question. But I don't know if there<br>
are any easy answers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suspect that it would probably *have* to be done using some type of fuzzy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetic algorithms because I am not so sure humans will ever have a good</i><br>
<i>&gt;model of this phenomenon.  It's not just that; how do you represent</i><br>
<i>&gt;something as abstract as a meme in the concrete environment of a computer in</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a way that it could be useably processed?</i><br>
<p>
The problem seems to me to be more fundamental than that. Physically,<br>
in their active (i. e. interesting) lifestage, memes are distributed<br>
information systems comprising multiple human brains. Human brains<br>
are the most sophisticated supercomputers the universe has come up<br>
with so far, and their computational processes seem to be at least<br>
a bit chaotic. I doubt that any simplified model run on any simpler<br>
computer can tell us very *much* about the entire process, although<br>
of course a lot of excellent work is being done in experimental<br>
economics. I just don't think that this work is going to give us<br>
"the whole story" in any interesting sense.<br>
