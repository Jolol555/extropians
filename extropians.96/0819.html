<i>                &gt;Uploading is impossible on von Neumann machines. Even</i><br>
<i>                &gt;semiconductor lithography is insufficient, dedicated maspar</i><br>
<i>                &gt;molecular hardware is required. Nothing less will serve.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The term "Von Neumann machine" can have 2 unrelated meanings, a computer with <br>
a Von Neumann architecture or a machine that can duplicate itself from raw <br>
matter.           <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;A human equivalent as implemented in molecular circuitry is</i><br>
<i>                &gt;thought in reside in a volume ranging from a sugar cube to</i><br>
<i>                &gt;an orange (with cooling, packaging, interfacing, etc. about</i><br>
<i>                &gt;the size of the fridge), and run at 1..10^3 realtime speed.</i><br>
<i>                &gt; Power burn might lie in kW range. Nanoists will claim much</i><br>
<i>                &gt;better performance in a much smaller package, but I tend to</i><br>
<i>                &gt;be less optimistic,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Using the figure Hans Moravec came up with,  10^13 calculations per second to<br>
emulate the human brain, Drexler determined that an uploaded human mind would <br>
not be very big. Less than an ounce of matter, mostly carbon, and about 15 <br>
watts of energy should be enough for an upload, much less if you use <br>
reversible computing. That's cheating a little because you'd also need a <br>
cooling system for the nano computer, but even so, it wouldn't use more <br>
energy than a dim light bulb and would probably weigh less.<br>
<p>
If you wanted VR too you'd need a little more power to simulate a rich  <br>
environment, an entire virtual world for the upload, but it wouldn't amount <br>
to much, because speed would not be an issue. Even if the computer that was<br>
simulating you and the virtual world was very slow, from your point of view <br>
it would seem infinitely fast. If the machine had performance problems all <br>
you'd have to do is have the part of the computer that was simulating you<br>
slowed down or even stopped, while leaving the part of the computer that<br>
simulated the rest of the universe running at normal speed. Regardless of how<br>
many calculations it would take to convince you that the simulation was real<br>
it could be done instantly, from your point of view. Once the machine was<br>
caught up, our part  of the computer could be carefully restarted till the<br>
next speed bottleneck.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;practicablity of strong Drexlerian nanotechnology has not </i><br>
<i>                &gt;been demonstrated yet. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The practicality of nanotechnology has been demonstrated by life. The<br>
practicability of strong Drexlerian Nanotechnology has not been demonstrated<br>
for the simply reason that it is not practical, yet. What Drexler has shown is<br>
that it is an engineering problem not a scientific one, that it, there is no<br>
known physical reason that would make it impossible.<br>
                  <br>
                <br>
<i>                &gt;Anyway, diamond rod logic is too slow in comparison to </i><br>
<i>                &gt;molecular switches, which operate on electronically excited </i><br>
<i>                &gt;molecular states/quantum dot arrays.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not too slow for an upload. The acoustic speed in a diamond is 1.75 X 10^4 <br>
meters per second, pretty slow compared to the speed if light at 3 X 10^8 <br>
but very fast compared to the signals the brain uses at about 100 meters a<br>
second or less, sometimes much less. Because they would be so small, diamond<br>
rod logic would be far faster than any electronic logic circuits we have today,<br>
and enormously faster than the old steam powered biological brain each of us<br>
uses today.  <br>
<p>
Fast as it is I'm sure we can do better. Drexler uses rod logic because it's <br>
easier to design than nanometer electronic logic, and if you want to show a <br>
proof of concept it makes sense to do so as simply as possible.<br>
<p>

<i>                     &gt;&gt;Honestly, am I the only extropian who likes the flesh?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You might have no choice. You seem to assume that &gt;H level</i><br>
<i>        &gt;intelligences to be actively benign, leaving you a sufficient part</i><br>
<i>        &gt;of resources.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree with Eugene. If the &gt;H are nice enough to let us live, it will<br>
probably be in VR. They won't want us using up a lot of resources in the<br>
"real" world and they would probably be a bit squeamish about letting us fool<br>
around at that level of reality, like letting a monkey run around in an<br>
operating room. They'll probably want a firewall to protect themselves from<br>
our stupidity.<br>
