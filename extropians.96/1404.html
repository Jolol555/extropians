Reilly Jones, please!  Sarah never said that two *contradictory* events ever <br>
happen at the same time, in the same place.  All she said is that many things <br>
happen at the same time.  For example, I am living here and going about my <br>
daily activities AT THE SAME TIME as billions of other people on earth are <br>
living in their various places and going about their various daily activities. <br>
 All the cells in my body are all active and doing various things AT THE SAME <br>
TIME, not one after the other.  I don't see what's so damn hard about <br>
understanding this.  And I don't see how anyone could misinterpret what Sarah <br>
said, unless they did it intentionally, or were in such a hurry to disagree <br>
that they didn't read what she said carefully.<br>
<p>
