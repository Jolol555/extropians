Sorry to decrease the s:n (signal to noise) ratio on this list, but I was<br>
thinking the same thing: email lists are for exchanging words.  Just LOOKING<br>
at the contents of this list, how do you expect to SEE anybody DOING<br>
anything other than trading and sharing ideas?  That's what it's for.  Why<br>
would you assume that no one is doing anything else?<br>
