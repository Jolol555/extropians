<i>&gt; You mean silence is good evidence for unlimited local computation?</i><br>
<p>
It is local, but not local as we H's know it :)<br>
<p>
Most recent universe theories seem to imply our universe fluctuates on <br>
very small scale, a quantum soup of baby bobbling universes, which can <br>
sometimes persist and expand to macro scale. The usual basement universe <br>
fabrication theory assumes a &gt;H can precipitate a universe with desired <br>
properties by tweaking this_space parameters, stabilize an ingress channel <br>
long enough to upload down there, let the channel collapse &amp; live on the <br>
self-fabricated Eden from then on, amen.<br>
<p>
Of course our space time might not contain such emergency exit machinery. <br>
If it doesn't, there is nothing what we (or &gt;H's, or even Omega) can do <br>
about it.<br>
<p>
Since a silence in the skies there is, it may be considered as an <br>
argument pro 'fire exit' existance. (Of course there are other, more <br>
likely options).<br>

Um, I misunderstood you. I was thinking about a solid state civilization, <br>
a mind ecology, a &gt;H. Since this is post-Singularity I thought we cannot <br>
know anything about it. If this is a ecology in the Darwinian sense, then <br>
yes, it will probably show boundless expansion.<br>

<p>
I agree: if Darwin, then expansion.<br>

<i>&gt; The question is why they don't use the resources, mass and negentroy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; near us.</i><br>
<p>
Because they are not expansive? Because we fail to percieve them with our <br>
crude tools/they operate at lower energetical levels than we think they <br>
do?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sometimes I think that the "natural order" is artificial: stars are </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But then why have we had so much success explaining astrophysical</i><br>
<i>&gt; phenomena with simple physical processes?</i><br>
<p>
Yes. This is good argument. However, we can't even explain the lack of <br>
solar neutrinos yet. Either our theories are faulty, incomplete or <br>
there are green men frolicking in the Sun :)  <br>
