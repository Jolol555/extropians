<p>
While my views might be considered somewhat extreme, I think the term <br>
science has been somewhat debased in the past decades. Not willing to <br>
revive the dead and rotten (and good riddance) physics&amp;lyrics thread, <br>
science, regrettably, is not a (tm), alas. Absurd combinations like <br>
"christian science" and "domestic science" etc. prove my point. Imho, <br>
the term science (probably accompanied by the "hard" epithet) should be <br>
reserved for mathematics and physics alone, secondary sciences (e.g. <br>
chemistry, molecular biology, etc.), then medicine, social sciences, <br>
historical sciences (archeometry is an exact science, though) etc. only <br>
following after.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the good double-blind drug and treatment studies that doctors have</i><br>
<p>
These _are_ methods of good science, but a) they are applied upon an <br>
unsuitable, since much too complex object, aka the human being b) lacking <br>
rigorous training, e.g. in lowly statistics, the average medical <br>
researcher can produce any amount of biased, unreproducible data. While <br>
reading a medical paper, it is always helpful to remind oneself, how these<br>
neat numbers are produced. Scientific standards are much lower in the <br>
medical science, e.g. M.D. is _not_ equivalent to Ph.D.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; been doing for decades, then please enlighten us as to its definition</i><br>
<i>&gt; so that we may argue the same propositions. </i><br>
<p>
Obviously, it is a definition thing. Apologies, if my remarks appeared <br>
inflammatory, they were surely not intended in that way.<br>
