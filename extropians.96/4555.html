Here's a solution we may want to try, to have a list with a high signal:noise <br>
ratio.  Lets make two lists.  One of them will be the "Quality Extropian List" <br>
and the other will be "Casual Extropian List"  Everyone will have access to <br>
both lists and before posting anything, will decide which list their post is <br>
most appropriate for.  This post, for example, would go on the Casual <br>
Extropian List, since I don't think it is a particularly high quality or <br>
interesting enough post to put on the Quality Extropian List, which should be <br>
reserved for more well-thought-out and well-written essays.  It will be up to <br>
individual posters to post their writings to the appropriate list.  Each of us <br>
writes high quality posts sometimes and also engages in idle banter about some <br>
mildly interesting subject.  Those who want to read only high quality posts <br>
can subscribe only to the Quality Extropian List.  Those who want both, can <br>
subscribe to both and perhaps contribute to both.  Also, most comments <br>
regarding posts appearing on the Quality Extropian List should be directed to <br>
the Casual Extropian List, unless the comments are well-thought-out and <br>
well-written enough to warrant being on the Quality Extropian List.<br>
<p>
There would, of course, be no one stopping anyone from posting whatever they <br>
wanted on the Quality Extropian List.  But I think we're capable of governing <br>
ourselves and voluntarily obeying the rules of the forum.  Let's give it a <br>
try.  If it doesn't work, then we can always go back the way we do it now.  I <br>
think it could be a lot better than what we have now, though.  Especially for <br>
the people reading the archives, since they can get right to the quality stuff <br>
without having to filter through all the mediocre stuff.<br>
