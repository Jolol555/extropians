I just read (and replied to) a vicious post by Mark Stahlman on the Threads<br>
discussion of the debate I'm having on HotWired about Extropians ideas. A<br>
number of the anti-extropians have substituted assertions and feelings for<br>
reasonable arguments, but Stahlman wins the "asshole poster" award! He<br>
called me a "madman" and "dishonest". His claim of dishonesty being based on<br>
his view that I (and all Extropians) are out to control other people. As I<br>
noted, this is so obviously far from the truth that Stahlman himself is<br>
being dishonest, not just mistaken.<br>
<p>
I've heard a little about Stahlman, who I believe works with New Media<br>
Associates in New York. I had a rather negative impression of him as one who<br>
makes incendiary posts without really arguing. This post certainly verifies<br>
that impression! I'd appreciate any information about Stahlman -- his views,<br>
his writings -- that could help me get a grip on his point of view. I expect<br>
he will reply, so I'd like to see if there's some way I can have a<br>
productive discussion with him. He may only be interested in name-calling<br>
though.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
