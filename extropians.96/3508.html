Lyle raises an interesting and important issue: the relationship between<br>
religions, especially Christianity, and science. While I think Lyle is<br>
partially right, I think he also goes too far.<br>
<p>
Saying that "Science appeared in Europe, at a time when virtually all<br>
Europeans were Christian" is suggestive but sounds like the fallacy of post<br>
hoc ergo propter hoc (after it, therefore because of it). Of course science<br>
arose in a religious culture. How many *non-religious* cultures have there<br>
been to compare? Even the officially atheistic (and short-lived) Soviet<br>
culture was never atheistic. Most of the population continued their<br>
religious believes quietly. The major visible resurgence of religion after<br>
the fall of communism showed that religion had never been extirpated. So<br>
it's hard to find non-religious cultures to compare. Britain, while in the<br>
most secular period of the Enlightenment, made enormous advances. However,<br>
clearly, Christianity was still strong. Ancient Greece, where scientific and<br>
technical advances were relatively impressive, was religious, though<br>
polytheistic.<br>
<p>
Certainly non-scientific beliefs and attitudes have powerfully inspired<br>
scientific advance. To the extent that this is Lyle's point, I think it<br>
should be granted. The question is then whether this inspiration and<br>
motivation is specifically religious. I say no. It *can* be: Kepler saw<br>
astronomers as "priests of the most high God with respect to the book of<br>
nature," and saw his own role as "the honor of guarding, with my discovery,<br>
the door of God's temple, in which Copernicus serves before the high altar."<br>
<p>
However, inspiration has been provided as much by philosophy as by religion.<br>
Complicating the issue is the point that philosophy and religion are not<br>
strictly separated realms of thought. (Here I'm talking about philosophy in<br>
it's grandest sense of a search for a deep understanding of the universe and<br>
our place in it, rather than the dry, narrow, technical questions that<br>
concern most modern philosophers.) I locate the distinction between the two<br>
in their attitude towards reason. Philosophers at least attempt to use<br>
reason to move toward truth. Religious thinkers look towards inspiration,<br>
revelation, and faith as the ultimate sources of knowledge. However, some<br>
religious thinkers (notably Aquina and Occam) use reason in the service of<br>
religious goals. Also, philosophers can cross the line, letting their<br>
investigations be driven by preconceptions, rationalizations, and feelings.<br>
<p>
Certainly Christianity has, for some people, motivated their scientific<br>
inquiry. (Scientific advance was, for a time, strong in the Orient, but I<br>
don't know much about the interplay of eastern religion and science to<br>
comment.) For others, Christianity has been nothing but a block to science.<br>
I think that the *core* of Christianity is inimical to science. The Garden<br>
of Eden story teaches that individual thinking is bad, that obedience is<br>
good. The New Testament teaches that simplicity and becoming as a little<br>
child is good, which hardly seems conducive to scientific thinking. Luther,<br>
the founder of Protestantism, taught that reason was "the Devil's Whore".<br>
Ironically, Luther's rebellion led ultimately to a breakdown of confidence<br>
in religious authorities. The unintended consequences of Luther's life were<br>
a strengthening of a pro-science culture. <br>
<p>
All forms of religious fundamentalism are antithetical towards science. This<br>
is true of Christian fundamentalists who stick to Creationism because they<br>
have to validate the Bible. It is true of Marxist fundamentalists who forced<br>
Lysenkoism on science in the Soviet Union. <br>
<p>
The connection between science and technology and material goods has also<br>
meant a conflict between some interpretations of Christianity and science.<br>
Those forms of the religion that stress other-worldliness will frown upon<br>
attempts to understand, manipulate, and improve the physical world.<br>
Fortunately, under the influence of other philosophical ideas, many<br>
Christians have been more friendly to science. Those influenced by the Old<br>
Testament's injunction to take dominion of the Earth (just leave the rest of<br>
the universe to non-Christians please!) might be more open to materialistic<br>
science.<br>
<p>
Early and Medieval Christianity stopped scientific progress and reversed<br>
Hellenistic advances. Science only took off when Hellenistic ideas from<br>
Plato and Aristotle were taken into Christianity. Primarily this was the<br>
Neoplatonist belief in mathematical order. (Copernicus and Kepler were<br>
Neoplatonists, believing that the observable universe embodied universal<br>
mathematical laws.) Neoplatonism inspired mathematicians, astronomers, and<br>
physicists. However, even then, Christianity clung to Aristotle for a<br>
thousand years in its characteristically dogmatic way, stopped further progress.<br>
<p>
Newton made incredible advances. Unfortunately he spent as much time<br>
absorbed in theology and biblical prophecy as with physics. What might he<br>
have achieved without that time-wasting? (Or did he need it as a form of<br>
recreation?) In Ancient Greece, the brilliant mathematician Pythagoras, ran<br>
a bean-worshipping cult. It seems unlikely to me that this *helped* his<br>
math. His strange and brilliant mind found expression in both ways, but I<br>
see no reason to believe that his cultist beliefs improved his math.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;What we call the "singularity" (for lack of a better term) will not </i><br>
<i>&gt;happen by accident.  It will be brought about by someone who intends </i><br>
<i>&gt;to bring it about, and that person will be fully aware that the very idea </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the "singularity" has its roots in the Bible.  </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps. It may also be brought about by those inspired by a vision of the<br>
Singularity that has nothing to do with the Bible. I agree with what I take<br>
to be Lyle's underlying point, that scientific progress often is driven by<br>
an inspiring vision. As I've tried to say above, I grant this may be<br>
religious. But it can be a non-religious philosophical vision. (Or it may be<br>
a mixture of the two). More often that not, I think the specifically<br>
religious parts of a person's thinking detract from scientific advance. It<br>
is the philosophical aspects that value reason that help that person's<br>
scientific thinking. Where I do basically agree with Lyle is in saying that<br>
an inspiring vision or enthusiasm is important to much scientific progress.<br>
