Well i think the weather is to imprecise for us to controll. It's to big a<br>
mechanism. It's a bit like curing cancer with chemo therapy. overall you<br>
maybe can make things work but you kill of a lot of healthy cells in the<br>
process. That can be a bit of a problem when the weather is the cancer and<br>
humans are the healthy cells. It would be a PR nightmare at least.<br>
<p>
And what about the ice age. Recent findings from the inlandic ice on<br>
Greenland shows that a new ice age can pop up within as little as 20 years.<br>
<p>
<p>
Instead of changing the enviroment as we do now when we look at the small<br>
scale, wouldn't it be better to adapt to it. If we can imagine building big<br>
O'Neill type space stations in orbit, and the colonialisation of Mars,<br>
couldn't we imagine doing similar things here on earth. (there's still a<br>
lot of parcels available in Sahara ;-) )<br>
