<i>&gt; Hi David:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;They'll [power centers] still screw us if they ever get the</i><br>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;prescription for paranoid encryption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Power exists in society (fortunately, I'd hate to live in a powerless world)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and like matter, energy, information, and everything else in the  Universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is not distributed evenly; after all, we've known for more than a century</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the aether does not exist. Raging against power centers is like raging</i><br>
<i>&gt; against electromagnetism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  &gt;Bullshit.  Kazynski would use PGP if he could.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
As would be his right until the moment he actually commits a crime that<br>
violates another's individual rights. Guns don't kill people, people<br>
kill people.<br>
<p>
Tools like PGP are needed to rebalance our system which is heavily<br>
weighted for those in power in both governments and corporations (they<br>
have their own secrecy system, known as "proprietary rights") to keep<br>
their secrets whil being able to lay you bare. Once our culture becomes<br>
rebalanced, thanks to PGP and possibly Super-FOIA legislation which may<br>
be needed, because people can keep secrets if they wish to, most wont<br>
need to, because power centers will find invading your privacy to be not<br>
a profitable practice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;When OTHER Kazynskis want to do it, they most certainly will.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, and he made his bombs out of materials available at the local<br>
hardware store. Should we ban hardware stores?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;I know that men who escape accountability often conspire</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;together to rob other men of their liberty, and then their</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;women and wheat.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, the government currently has its own security/privacy system<br>
called the classified information system, which it uses to enforce its<br>
monopoly on keeping you down whenever it feels like it. It uses this<br>
capability to steal technology from inventors, which it then gives to<br>
its defense vassals to make huge profits off the inventors tax dollars.<br>
Until either governments are stripped of the ability to keep secrets, or<br>
individuals are given equal capability (thanks to PGP) the repression<br>
will continue. This is why they were so hot at Phill Zimmerman, he<br>
released it internationally without applying for a copyright, so the<br>
feds had no advance notification to be able to block him. If extropy<br>
were a religion, Phill would be a Saint.<br>
<p>
Frankly Dave, I'm surprised that you take this view. Look at the latest<br>
spy case. If Pitt's espionage actually causes the death of any<br>
government assets, he can get the death penalty. This is obviously not a<br>
free society when governments can keep secrets enforcable with a death<br>
penalty. Governments will only cease to practice secrecy when their<br>
citizens are able to force them to open all their doors. Espionage<br>
should be an accepted method of government oversight, not punishable<br>
with death.<br>
