Two days ago you asked me not to "reply or bother to draw me into further<br>
debate."  Please note the above was not addressed to you.<br>
<p>
Since you previously accused me of using ad hominem arguments, I think it<br>
is fair for me to point out that you are now resorting to "straw man"<br>
tactics.  I have never advocated "more government."  In fact, my advocacy<br>
of significantly less government is documented in two books and dozens of<br>
articles.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to be a universal tactic all over the internet that those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to pooh-pooh the Navy TWA 800 theory are actually assuming to score</i><br>
<i>&gt;points against the theory by suggesting that those who broach the theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;are saying "here's what really happened." Yet in fact I've yet to see</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone, with perhaps the exception of Salinger, say that.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nonsense.  The message "forwarded by Peter James" and posted to this forum<br>
stated "TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE."  When I<br>
expressed skepticism about this statement, you accused me of denying that<br>
TWA Flight 800 could have been downed by a *missile*, which is also not<br>
what I said.<br>
<p>
Have a nice day :-)<br>
