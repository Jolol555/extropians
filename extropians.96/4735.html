<i>&gt;I have nothing against highly respected people (a.k.a. "leaders); in fact, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;wish to become one myself.  But I believe that people's most influential </i><br>
<i>&gt;leaders should be themselves; that people should look to themselves to</i><br>
decide <br>
<i>&gt;what to do with their lives rather than doing what others say they "should" </i><br>
<i>&gt;do.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I was unclear. This is exactly the type of "leader" I was referring<br>
to. Leaders in industry such as Bill Gates or Marc Andreessen--Leaders of<br>
ideas and yes the do generate media hype. Also tell me if extropians<br>
created a good deal of media hype that we wouldn't be further in the<br>
revolution then we are now? Hype is to the people as religion is. Hype is a<br>
POWERFUL memetic strategy and all without violating rights. I completely<br>
agree with you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The revolution that is occuring right now on this planet in freedom and </i><br>
<i>&gt;independence of thought and the general "waking up" of humanity is a very </i><br>
<i>&gt;quiet revolution.  It's a revolution that takes place within individual </i><br>
<i>&gt;humans, as individuals start realizing that they can take control of their</i><br>
own <br>
<i>&gt;lives and become the people they want to be.</i><br>
<p>
I know. When everyone attains this new level of self-awareness and<br>
independence it WILL be incredible. You will see more ideas than in the<br>
history of the human race. The second renaissance. It will be very "cool"<br>
uhh, er "cryo". I'll love every bit of it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's not something that receives </i><br>
<i>&gt;a lot of media hype, because each time the revolution happens, it only </i><br>
<i>&gt;involves a single person.  People just start waking up and getting their</i><br>
lives <br>
<i>&gt;figured out; they start realizing what they want and how to make it.  It's </i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing that is decided by the government leaders, and they actually have</i><br>
very <br>
<i>&gt;little influence over the revolution, since they don't have fine-grained </i><br>
<i>&gt;control over every individual's mind.  The revolution is not an</i><br>
organization; <br>
<i>&gt;it has no leaders.</i><br>
<p>
But the current "mindless masses" can currently identify with these<br>
"leaders" and speed up the process. You're telling me that if Max More was<br>
a news anchor he wouldn't be influencing masses of people and spreading the<br>
extropian memes far and wide? I'm sure even after "The Great Libertarian<br>
Awakening" we will still have "leaders" in ideas. Hype &amp; "leaders" also<br>
define standards by having everyone focus on one product such as the hype<br>
Microsoft creates which allows application developers to develop for a<br>
single platform even if another platform happens to be better. You need a<br>
large amount of features and a small pinch of standards.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; technology of the internet compared to the average person. Living up</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; here in the sticks, I find myself day by day becoming less and less able</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to relate to the people in my community, as they are less and less able</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While on the first glance this may sound like tripe, it is true. I made </i><br>
<i>&gt;the observation myself. This insight is not exactly comforting.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly why we extropians should become more social with each other so we<br>
can evolve together and not separate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I could see where this separation between the technological vanguard </i><br>
<i>&gt;and everyone else could become deadly significant--the point at which </i><br>
<i>&gt;someone invents a transformational technology that renders the users </i><br>
<i>&gt;nonhuman.  That might rupture the process of information dissemination </i><br>
<i>&gt;and leave a lot of people behind, unless this was taken into account </i><br>
<i>&gt;during the development of the technology.</i><br>
<p>
Right on the money Kathryn!<br>
