<i>&gt; The question is, given such a miraculous device, how hard </i><br>
<i>&gt; would it be for you, meaning the typical programmer reading this, </i><br>
<i>&gt; to produce a program which could pass the Turing test...</i><br>
<p>
For newbies, maybe we should introduce this term.  Turing's test was <br>
proposed by Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science.   <br>
The idea is that you want to determine when an AI program has reached <br>
the human level of intelligence.  So you have a conversation with it <br>
through a terminal.  You can ask it any question you want, and you try <br>
to judge, from its answers, whether they are being generated by a <br>
human or a computer.  If you think your correspondent is human, and <br>
then the experimenter lets you look behind the curtain, and there is a <br>
computer sitting there -- the program has passed the test.  <br>
<p>
Some time ago, a group of cs students at Carnegie Mellon decided to <br>
run an experiment.  They subscribed their AI program to the Extropian <br>
list under a made-up name.  Their program participates in the various <br>
discussions on this list.  It doesn't get any help from the students. <br>
The Extropians have accepted it as part of the group.  No one notices <br>
anything different about it -- no one has seriously raised the question of <br>
whether it might not be what it purports to be, i.e. just another human.  <br>
In other words, this program has passed the Turing test, so far.  <br>
