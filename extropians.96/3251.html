I saw something on this on the Discovery channel.  It was pretty<br>
interesting.  They have been currently experimenting with 8 x 8 sensor<br>
arrays, but they believe they can achieve a much higher sensor density than<br>
this.  The difficulty is attaching the electronic device to the nervous<br>
system.  It is currently done by surgically attaching nerves to fine wires<br>
on the backside of the device.  The person then has to "learn" to organize<br>
the inputs into a coherent pattern.<br>
<p>
What I find interesting is that the nervous system can adapt to the input<br>
device without us having any knowledge of which neuron should be attached<br>
where.  The brain sorts out the interface all by itself.  Admittedly the<br>
current 8x8 resolution is kind of low, but very useful if you are blind, and<br>
onboard logic does some processing for the device.  Note however, that an<br>
external power supply is required.<br>
<p>
As far as augmentation goes, reportedly the device allowed the test subjects<br>
to see well into the infrared range and in extremely low light levels.  This<br>
is a consequence of the sensor technology, and not really an intentional<br>
goal of the device.  It would be a useful augmentation though!<br>
