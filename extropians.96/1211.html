Assuming we ever hit the bottom (no evidence of such to date), why not move<br>

Ouch.  Every time I see a statement like this I'm painfully reminded how<br>
difficult it is to articulate QM in plain english.  But what the heck,<br>
I'll give it another try: it's no good thinking of the Universe *existing*<br>
as probabilities.  Quantum mechanics describes not the existence of<br>
reality, but its observed behavior.  It's a MODEL, just that.  Describing<br>
"quantum world" in terms of "probability" is futile.  Quantum world, if<br>
you chose to "believe" in it, is more fundamental than the probability.<br>
The probabilistic nature is not inherent in the MODEL, it's a consequence<br>
of the measurement, by which we obtain information about the workings of<br>
the Universe.  You don't describe the more fundamental in terms of the less<br>
fundamental.  It would be like trying to explain the q/r model of<br>
electrostatic potential in terms of why things don't fall apart.  It's<br>
just the other way around; this way it's a non-question.<br>
<p>
(Sheesh, look at that paragraph.  No matter how hard one tries, it's<br>
still a formidable didactic puzzle.  Many briliaant students have spent<br>
years trying to "understand" QM.  What a waste.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems so; quantum computers and </i><br>
<i>&gt;statistics are obviously useful. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, we can put it to work.  And it doesn't matter whether it's a <br>
complete theory or not, as long as it works (to us experimentalists, at<br>
least :).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps there are some physicists around here who can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; provide reassuring answers...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The universe has no obligation to be reassuring.</i><br>

Beautiful.  Straight into my quote-file.<br>
