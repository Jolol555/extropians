too much shooting from the hip. Yet, there are a number of very<br>
knowledgable, highly intelligent and polite writers on these lists. I<br>
like the concept of peer reviewed contribution admission to a public<br>
list."<br>
<p>
Depending on Internet traffic congestion and how often you check your<br>
email, the number of messages you receive at any one time can now<br>
approach 100 (I found 67 when I went into the office and checked last<br>
Saturday afternoon, and many more came in while I worked), and it's<br>
likely to get even worse if the list stays open and more people on the<br>
net become interested in Transhuman and Extropian ideas.  I now think<br>
Peter's right and some alternative for busy and/or serious readers is<br>
desirable.<br>
<p>
One alternative I have in mind seems simpler and more open than Robin's<br>
idea and would guard against Kathryn Aegis's concern about a closed list<br>
"degenerating into intellectual insularity".<br>
<p>
The idea is that there would be a second list available where the<br>
participants in a particular thread, or series of related threads, could<br>
regularly post a summary of what their thread had been discussing.  This<br>
would require some extra effort by those participants to summarize and<br>
integrate their ideas.  If people on opposite sides of a debate couldn't<br>
come to a consensus on what the summary should contain, each 'side'<br>
would be free to post their own summary.<br>
<p>
The fact that particpants would have to make this extra summarizing<br>
effort might help insure that the second list wasn't so noisy as the<br>
open list and provided the desirable "common sense of what [the]<br>
community is seeing," that Robin mentioned.  Of course, some people like<br>
to 'always' start their own threads and often post essay-length pieces. <br>
I guess if no thread developed on the subject and the poster thought it<br>
was worthwhile, they could be free to forward their piece to the second<br>
list after a while.<br>
<p>
the bigger problem is that I'm not sure how this approach would help<br>
those who want to receive newsy type information (e.g., conference<br>
announcements or calls for comments regarding some formal research<br>
effort) but don't have the time or interest in ongoing thread debates. <br>
Perhaps there could be a third list for this type of information?<br>
<p>
No solution is going to be perfect and this approach could be subject to<br>
abuse.  One way to supplement this approach, though it adds quite a bit<br>
of complexity, would be to have the summary list be a Web archive that<br>
does not get mailed out until a review committee has had a chance to<br>
purge any spam that might have gotten in there.  I'm too much of an<br>
Internet &amp; Web novice, however, to know whether this idea (selecting and<br>
mailing out Web documents) is practical.  Then, like the closed-list<br>
idea, there's the problem of who would (and could) serve on this review<br>
committee.<br>
