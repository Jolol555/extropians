Keith Henson &lt;hkhenson@netcom.com&gt; asked me to post this to the<br>
list for critical feedback and discussion. I thought the essay<br>
interesting enough to post to the list, and I hope that no one is<br>
terribly inconvenienced by its length.<br>

A Memetic/Evolutionary Psychology Connection Between Drugs and<br>
Cults  <br>
<p>
<p>
DRAFT VERSION FOR COMMENT--DO NOT WEB, ASK FOR FINAL VER.<br>
<p>
By H. Keith Henson (hkhenson@netcom.com,keith@xanadu.com)<br>
<p>
I have studied and written about *memes* for well over ten years. <br>
Much about these *replicating information patterns* is obvious--<br>
given the selfish gene model from which the concept was derived. <br>
Memes, with few exceptions, exist in the context of human carriers<br>
and their artifacts.  The information which is passed from person<br>
to person and from generation to generation is the primary factor<br>
which gives humans a competitive advantage over the rest of the<br>
animals.  A modern example which shows the power of memes is that<br>
human children do not have to learn that streets are dangerous<br>
places by trial and error.<br>
<p>
In the aggregate, memes make up human culture.  Most of them are of<br>
the rock-chipping/shoemaking/vehicle-avoiding kind--they provide<br>
clear benefits to those who host them.  They are passed from<br>
generation to generation because of the benefits (ultimately to the<br>
genes of their hosts) they provide.<br>
<p>
But a whole class of memes fails to have such obvious replication<br>
drivers.  Memes of this class, which includes religions, cults and<br>
social movements such as communism, have induced some of the most<br>
spectacular events in human history, including mass suicides, wars,<br>
migrations, crusades, and other forms of large-scale social unrest.<br>
<p>
These memes often induce humans to actions which seriously damage<br>
or destroy their potential for reproductive success.  The classic<br>
example is the nearly extinct Shakers--whose meme set completely<br>
forbids sex.  While inducing such behavior makes sense when viewed<br>
from the *meme's* viewpoint (diverting host time and energy from<br>
bearing and caring for children to propagating the meme) it makes<br>
no sense when considered from the *gene's* viewpoint for a<br>
susceptibility to this class of memes to have evolved.<br>
<p>
This is where my understanding about the vulnerability of humans to<br>
this class of memes was stuck for many years.  It was recently<br>
unstuck by a new discipline which has grown out of the early work<br>
in sociobiology.  This new field is most often called evolutionary<br>
psychology.  What evolutionary psychology proposes to do is explain<br>
the features of the human mind in terms of what mental traits led<br>
to *reproductive success* in the *ancestral environment*.  <br>
<p>
The reason the *ancestral environment* is specified is that<br>
evolution works slowly.  There has not been enough time for human<br>
genes to have adjusted much to the changes in the environment in<br>
the last few thousand years--and, in fact, most humans lived in<br>
tribes or small villages until relatively recent generations.<br>
That environment is almost gone--our success has greatly modified<br>
the world--but the few remaining hunter-gatherer groups and our<br>
nearest relatives give us a general picture.  While there was<br>
plenty of variation in what people did for a living (depending on<br>
local resources) the picture which emerges of the previous several<br>
million years is that of a social primate living in small bands and<br>
villages.<br>
<p>
Of all the things which have been measured in such representative<br>
ancestral environments as we have, social standing or status is the<br>
most predictive of reproductive success.  This is true for both<br>
sexes, though the potential rewards for high status were--and still<br>
are--higher for males.  High status males had multiple wives or<br>
additional mating opportunities in the ancestral environment (and<br>
for that matter, still do).  High status females, from what we can<br>
see in chimpanzees and humans, have no more offspring than low<br>
status ones, but their children are more likely to survive.  (In<br>
bad times, much more likely to survive.)  <br>
<p>
It follows that humans would have evolved to be exquisitely<br>
sensitive to changes in status, which (no surprise) is the observed<br>
situation.  Activities which lead to feelings of increasing status<br>
are highly rewarding: that is, they cause the release of chemicals<br>
which induce highly pleasurable states in the brain.  This reward<br>
system is fundamental to human motivation, and in the ancestral<br>
environment it worked to enhance reproductive success most of the<br>
time.  It makes sense for hunters who brought in the first meat the<br>
tribe has seen in six weeks to get a lot of attention (a mark of<br>
status) from the other tribe members and to experience rewarding<br>
feelings about what they had done as a (real) increase in social<br>
status.  Of course, people tend to repeat behavior which led to<br>
flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals.  In our hunter<br>
example, more hunting leads to more protein for the hunter's<br>
mate(s) and children which in turn leads to improved reproductive<br>
success--and thus to another generation of status-seeking hunters<br>
who are rewarded individually with brain chemicals and in the<br>
evolutionary sense by more children.  There are two causal loops<br>
involved here.  The short term one acts over hours to years, and<br>
the long term one over generations.  The long term loop sets up<br>
susceptibility to the short term loop.<br>
<p>
In short, an action (such as hunting) leads to attention (an<br>
indicator of status) which in the short term releases rewarding<br>
brain chemicals and in the long term improves reproductive success.<br>
<p>
Simple conditioning of the Pavlovian type will move some of the<br>
reward release "upstream" so that the acts which later result in<br>
reward chemical releases will themselves become rewarding.<br>
<p>
In time humans discovered drugs which shortcut this action-<br>
attention-reward (AAR) brain mechanism and directly flood the brain<br>
with pleasurable chemicals.  The behavior of smoking or injecting<br>
drugs which simulate the natural chemicals is highly rewarding, and<br>
(in some people) leads to the repeated behavior we refer to as<br>
addiction.  The brain reward system involved in drug addiction can<br>
be stimulated in other ways, for example by gambling.  People who<br>
liken compulsive gambling to drug addiction are right; the rewards<br>
compulsive gamblers get are only one step removed from exogenous<br>
chemicals--with the "Attention" step diminished or removed.<br>
<p>
Gambling and drugs cause misfiring of the AAR mechanisms, and often<br>
result in severe damage to reproductive potential, but both are<br>
very recent in human history.  In the past, evolution favored those<br>
who were motivated by the mechanism.<br>
<p>
The importance of the AAR mechanism is hard to underestimate. It<br>
may well be the most important motivating mechanism behind<br>
virtually all human activities.  In previous times it was tied<br>
directly into reproductive success, and it is still a major factor<br>
in this endeavor.<br>
<p>
It should come as no surprise that such a powerful mechanism can be<br>
taken over by drug-induced rewards.  It seems that this is not the<br>
only way the brain reward system can be parasitized.  Memes which<br>
we see as cults and related social movements seem to have<br>
"discovered" the AAR reward system as well.  Successful cult memes<br>
induce behavior (typically focused attention) between cult members<br>
which trips the "improving status" detectors.  Tripping the<br>
detectors causes the release of reward chemicals without having<br>
much (if any) connection to "real world" improvements in<br>
reproductive success.<br>
<p>
Examples of focused attention are "love bombing" in the Moonies and<br>
"auditing" in Scientology.  As an explanation for the propagation<br>
of the meme classes mentioned at the top of this article, I propose<br>
that successful cult memes induce behavior between cult members<br>
which results in the release of pleasure inducing chemicals into<br>
the reward system of the brain.  This release of chemicals results<br>
in reinforcement of behavior similar to that we see in addicts.<br>
<p>
Thus, it should come as no surprise that the behavior of people<br>
under the influence of cults is similar to that we observe in<br>
addicts.  Typical behavior for both includes draining bank accounts<br>
and education funds, selling or mortgaging property, neglecting<br>
children, destruction of relations with family and friends and lack<br>
of interest in anything except the drug or cult.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, understanding of the mechanisms behind cult or drug<br>
addiction has not yet led to better ways of treating either, but<br>
knowledge of the deep seated and highly evolved brain mechanisms<br>
involved in both may lead to better treatment methods.<br>
<p>
[Thanks to Kenneta Watson for the conversation where this<br>
understanding emerged and to Arel Lucas for editing suggestions.]<br>
