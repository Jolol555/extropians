<p>
This is something I have wondered about.  I don't know much about <br>
dinosaurs (vast understatement) but from the pictures I have seen, <br>
some of them appear to have been bipeds with hands.  They lived on earth <br>
for more than 100 million years, but never developed high intelligence.  <br>
Why?  <br>
<p>
Then again, maybe they did.  How would we know?  <br>
<p>
Suppose one species of dinosaur, which I will call Dinosaurus sapiens, <br>
did develop high intelligence.  This happened rather suddenly, in a few <br>
thousand years -- a span of time too short to notice in geological terms.  <br>
<p>
D sapiens was divided into races, only one of which discovered <br>
advanced science.  This advanced race of dinosaurs lived in a small <br>
area, which is now submerged.  Elsewhere, D sapiens were primitive <br>
creatures who had little interest in building permanent structures of <br>
stone or concrete; to the extent that they built buildings at all, they used <br>
wood, so there are no archeological traces of their civilization.  <br>
<p>
Even among the advanced group, knowledge of science and technology <br>
was confined to an elite.  Once they discovered the basic ideas of <br>
mathematics and experimental science, progress was rapid.  In a few <br>
generations, they reached the level we have reached now, and then...  <br>
they transcended.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, however, they disturbed their ecosystem so severely that <br>
the other dinosaurs (and many other life forms) which did not transcend <br>
didn't survive.  <br>
<p>
The question is whether it is possible to have advanced science <br>
without also having a world-wide industrial economy (which would <br>
leave traces even after 65 million years).  Given the assumption that <br>
this is possible (and also given the assumption that the expression  <br>
"they transcended" has some real content), the above scenario could <br>
have happened.  <br>
