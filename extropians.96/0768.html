This issue came up when I was debating Paulina Boorsook on the BrainTennis<br>
forum of HotWired. She was under the impression that all Extropians dislike,<br>
hate, fear, or feel uncomfortable in their physical bodies, and that we're<br>
all hell bent on dumping them. This may be true for some, but I know enough<br>
Extropians to know it's not generally true.<br>
<p>
I agree with you, Tim, in that I want a *choice* of bodies, physical and<br>
virtual. I take great pleasure in my current physical body and spend<br>
considerable time and energy to keep it in condition. Like any Extropian, I<br>
want to add to my body's abilities and to be able to modify its responses<br>
according to my will rather than leaving its responses and capacities<br>
primarily an accident of my genes. Eventually, assuming I make it to that<br>
time, I expect to see this body--or whatever it has become--as only one<br>
among a choice of physical vehicles.<br>
<p>
Tim, your comment suggests you think you might be the only one who<br>
appreciates the way of flesh among Extropians. That's certainly not true. I<br>
know many of us who love working out, having sex, hiking, surfing, skiing,<br>
swimming, etc. I think it's a big mistake to give the impression to the<br>
public that Extropians reject the physical body. Maybe a few seek to live as<br>
utterly disembodied thinkers, but most of us want to enjoy all the means of<br>
being in contact with reality, including physical sensations and perceptions.<br>
