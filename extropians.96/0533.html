A while back, I posted my opinions that the jump from prokaryotic to<br>
eukaryotic life (the evolution of endosymbiotic organelles and nuclei) was<br>
improbable enough that it probably makes up a substantial portion of the<br>
Great Filter.<br>
<p>
But after reading Robin's latest version of his essay, and being reminded<br>
by it that sophisticated tool use (which seems to me to be closely related<br>
to sophisticated language use and other means of culture-acquisition and<br>
culture-transmission) has only evolved once so far and seemingly led to an<br>
almost immediate technological-cultural explosion, I'm starting to think<br>
that this may be a *much* larger element in the Filter.<br>
<p>
Specifically, ruminating on these things reminded me of my own earlier<br>
complaints in an unrelated thread that we still haven't got any very good<br>
ideas about how to make unsupervised-learning feedback networks do useful<br>
things. Yet we human beings seem to be an existence proof that<br>
unsupervised-learning feedback networks can be very useful indeed. (I find<br>
people, myself in particular, to be the most useful tool to solve most of<br>
the problems I run into.  ;-)<br>
<p>
So now I'm starting to think that much of the Great Filter, probably much<br>
more than lies in the evolution of eukaryotic endosymbiosis, lies in the<br>
evolution of the various neural-net internal control mechanisms that enable<br>
us to learn and transmit culture, including language but many other<br>
memetic-transmission mechanisms as well. And given that evolutionary<br>
psychology is still a small, young field, it would make sense that we still<br>
wouldn't have a very good idea of how difficult this step might be.<br>
Certainly, surveying the current state of AI and neural-net engineering, it<br>
seems like a very difficult barrier for we ourselves to cross<br>
technologically.<br>
<p>
I've decided that I need to read Crick's book (I forgot what it's called,<br>
it has some wildly arrogant title calculated to sell a lot of copies) about<br>
the searchlight hypothesis, because given what little I know of the<br>
differences between human and nonhuman-animal psychology, I'd suspect that<br>
a new mechanism for deliberately controlling the focus of attention might<br>
be an important part of the evolutionary step up from ordinary mammalian<br>
intelligence to human, culture-rich intelligence. Nonhuman animals seem far<br>
more difficult to "distract" from their immediate surroundings and their<br>
immediate environment, whereas humans often get "lost in their thoughts",<br>
especially if they are absent-minded professors like Thales who was reputed<br>
to have fallen into a well once while wandering around stargazing. (I can<br>
relate!) I've never heard of elephants or dogs or dolphins or bonobos<br>
getting themselves into this sort of predicament of absent-mindedness. Such<br>
ability to distract oneself from one's immediate surroundings is a<br>
necessary part of the skill we call "studying", and all our best<br>
technologists understand how their skill at studying has led to the<br>
acquisition of most of their other technological skills. If any trained<br>
ethologists or evolutionary psychologists out there can tell me different<br>
(e. g. that nonhuman animals are known to suffer fits of<br>
"absent-mindedness" or "distraction"), I'd love to hear about it.<br>
