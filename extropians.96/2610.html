<i>&gt; Here is a quick little thought experiment for everyone on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploading/consciousness thread:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Assume uploading actually moved your currently operating stream of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness to a computer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose the upload apparatus was connected to a multiplexing device so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the upload data could be sent on two separate channels at the same time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now suppose you have two different computers connected up to the two</i><br>
<i>&gt; different channels.  Both computers reconstruct your stream of consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; as though each was the only computer connected to the upload apparatus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the apparatus is actually uploading *your* stream of consciousness, is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible for it to exist in two places at the same time?</i><br>
<p>
I would assume that during the upload process, to keep the stream of<br>
conciousness "connected" the mind would have to be cognizant, and would<br>
sense, in the case of one computer and one human, a sense of being in<br>
two places at once, and in the case of two computers being uploaded,<br>
three places. THe tough thing is running one mind off of multiple copies<br>
of the same file. I would expect some call conflicts to crop up. Once<br>
the upload is complete, the bio hardware would be basically blank, or<br>
remain connected to one of the new minds. Being connected to both I<br>
would expect to create a multiple personality type conflict. Perhaps the<br>
two new minds would have joint custody of the human interface tool? <br>

Mike v 2.0.A: "I get the old Mike on Mon, Wed, and Fri, while you get<br>
him for Tues, Wed, and Sat, and we'll trade off on Sundays"<br>
<p>
Mike v 2.0.B: " No fair you'll have him for both Monday Night Football<br>
and the X-Files...."<br>
<p>
Mike A: "OK I'll take Thursday and you can have Friday."<br>
<p>
Mike B: "But that means you'll get our night with Betty, and she's not<br>
doubled yet...."<br>
<p>
Mike A: "Ok we trade off Thursday instead of Sunday, but I get the weeks<br>
we stay over at her house..."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't having a single stream of consciousness and having two simultaneous</i><br>
<i>&gt; instances of a single stream mutually exclusive?</i><br>
<p>
Once the upload is finished, the two minds would be separate people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which instance is really *your* stream of consciousness?</i><br>
<p>
Both. This is budding, and we are each the same Mike as before, but not<br>
the same as each other, as we each start having different experiences,<br>
that make us different people.<br>
