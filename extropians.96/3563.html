 I suspect many longtime list members have been exposed to a variety of<br>
predictions based on naive extrapolations of present trends. "Moore's Law"<br>
has been one of the more successful heuristics, yet it is also known to be<br>
inaccurate.  For example, the original statement of "Moore's Law" claimed<br>
that there would be a doubling of elements on a chip every 12 months - not<br>
every eighteen months as claimed nowadays.<br>
<p>
I highly recommend that anyone interested in thinking about the future read<br>
one of the classic early articles of prediction based on mathematical<br>
extrapolation.<br>
<p>
Science Fiction is Too Conservative<br>
by G. Harry Stine<br>
May 1961<br>
Analog<br>
<p>
Many of the key ideas behind the notion of a "singularity" are contained in<br>
this article from 35 years ago. The article also illustrates how simplistic<br>
extrapolation can lead to wildly inaccurate projections.<br>
<p>
Examples:<br>
<p>
    `manned vehicles will be able to achieve near-infinite speeds by 1982.'<br>
<p>
This prediction came from graphing the speeds of vehicles over time.  The<br>
graph looks great - dramatic - it is superexponential. The prediction,<br>
however, was deeply flawed.<br>
<p>
   `Life expectancy is increasing, and this trend curve indicates that<br>
    anyone born after the year 2000 A.D. lives forever, barring accidents'. <br>
<p>
This is an intriguing projection - especially for a writer in 1961.  If<br>
nanotechnology succeeds `quickly' it might even turn out to be largely<br>
accurate (if you include events such as `war' and `terrorism' in the<br>
category `accidents'.)<br>
<p>
   `Population is rising rapidly, and early in the Twenty-first Century there<br>
   isn't enough room on the planet Earth for everybody.  This curve shows no<br>
   more signs of leveling off than the other trend curves do, so we cannot<br>
   take the easy way out via starvation, birth control, or mass destruction,<br>
   because those things are apparently not in the cards when other trend<br>
   curves are also considered.'<br>
<p>
Population curves have leveled off in many countries. There is negative<br>
population growth in some Western countries. Current projections by<br>
organizations such as the UN foresee a leveling off of the population.<br>
(Note, I think the UN projections as just as bogus as Stine's in this area<br>
but my point is that it is difficult to make projections.)<br>
<p>
  `By 1981, this trend curve shows that a single man will have available<br>
   under his control the amount of energy equivalent to that generated by<br>
   the entire sun.'<br>
<p>
Where is my super-atomic blaster ray? If we build Von-Neumann space probes,<br>
for example, then massive amounts of energy may, arguably, be controlled in<br>
the future.<br>
<p>
   `The number of circuits in cybernetic devices is increasing on the<br>
   familiar trend curve. The human brain has an estimated four billion<br>
   neural circuits. By 1970, computer engineers may have achieved the same<br>
   number of circuits in a digital computer; they may do this by building<br>
   one large computer or by slaving many smaller computers together by data<br>
   links as they have already started to do. ... Will these machines think?'<br>
<p>
Interesting projection. The notion of `four billion neural circuits' is pure<br>
guesswork. We still do not know how brains work - although we are rapidly<br>
making progress, I would claim. Certainly, there were no human-level AI<br>
systems in 1970, and there are none today - even the world's chess champion<br>
is still a human. However, Stine did foresee the exponential increase in<br>
computer power that is oft cited by latter day prognosticators.<br>
<p>
The article includes several pictures.<br>
<p>
Caption for the picture of lunar colony:<br>
<p>
The lunar colony...a drawing from a report on colonization done by the<br>
Martin Company in 1959.  American free enterprise has become imaginative and<br>
conceptual in its thinking while science fiction plods its weary, well-worn<br>
squirrel cage of old ideas.<br>
<p>
End caption<br>
<p>
The drawing of the lunar colony is from the perspective of a couple who are<br>
dining and overlooking a swimming pool, a fountain, a lake, a zoo and a golf<br>
area. They are in a bubble structure constructed with hexagonal plates and<br>
another bubble structure is visible through the transparent walls of the<br>
bubble.<br>
<p>
No prediction year is given for this lunar colony. Good move.<br>
<p>
In conclusion, Stine's article is must reading for anyone who likes to make<br>
predictions and who likes to think about the `singularity', in my opinion.  I<br>
especially recommend it to any person who likes to give dates with his or her<br>
predictions.<br>
<p>
I am not trying to make fun of Stine. In fact, in overall outline, he might<br>
be more right than wrong. Nor, do I wish to discourage thinking about the<br>
future - I do it all the time - I have done it for decades.  But, perhaps it<br>
is possible to learn from previous errors. <br>
