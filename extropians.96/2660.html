MMB said:<br>
<i>&gt; Err, _Plato's_ Republic, no?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Who shall lead?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Why, he who is most fit to lead."</i><br>
<p>
I like to think that anyone can lead. The real question is whether<br>
or not anyone chooses to follow. In my ideal world, everyone is<br>
the leader of a contingent of one, and there are no followers.<br>
But I'd be willing to settle for a world in which individual<br>
followers each choose their several leaders with a bit more care<br>
and consideration, and concentrate more on learning from their<br>
chosen leaders than on trying to draft the other sheep into their<br>
contingent. And leadership goes way beyond politics: there are<br>
leaders in art, leaders in science, leaders in philosophy, leaders<br>
in business, leaders in engineering... the list goes on and on,<br>
and it is my hope that this list of different kinds of leadership,<br>
different arenas of excellence, will keep growing.<br>
<p>
And of course (pace Ira Brodsky), parents should lead their children.<br>
But it would be nice to live in a world in which most people over, say,<br>
25 years of age were adults in the sense hinted at above. <br>
<p>
The default paradigm of leadership seems to be "one leader, many<br>
followers". I prefer "one follower (me), many leaders (those I have<br>
chosen)". By picking and choosing which knowledges, skills, and<br>
values to learn from which leaders, I remain an individual even<br>
while engaging in the activity of following. And following in the<br>
general sense is very important: anytime I am studying someone<br>
else's work, I am following them. Following others is how we learn.<br>
But following in the sense of "I'll let my leader have the final<br>
say on what is good" is something I don't care for at all. This is<br>
a fatal attitude even if one chooses 51% of the local population<br>
for one's leader. What is legal, what is good: these are two<br>
different questions, and ought to remain so, because the former<br>
ought to be a closed question whenever possible, and the latter<br>
has long been and remains an open question.<br>
