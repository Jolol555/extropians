I think I'm having a definition problem here. Perhaps a few of the more <br>
optimistic out there can enlighten me.<br>
<p>
My dictionary describes optimism as - Leibniz's doctrine that the world <br>
is the best of all possible worlds: a belief that everything is ordered <br>
for the best: a disposition to take a bright, hopeful view of things: <br>
hopefulness<br>
<p>
The first definition can't be extropian. Why, then, all the posts about <br>
improving the human condition? <br>
<p>
My perception of the shared extropian belief system (BS) is that there is <br>
an optimism about the future. Not necessarily optimism about the present. <br>
Guatemala? Bosnia? Zaire? Liberia? China? Russia? Urban America? Mexico? <br>
Myanamar? Tibet? Taiwan? Chechnya? Korea? Perhaps this is all part of the <br>
order that leads to the Best of All Possible Worlds.<br>
<p>
The 3rd definition I embrace as a remarkably effective psychological <br>
tool. When I notice paranoia creeping in I flip it to metanoia to see <br>
what it looks like.(It's a conspiracy, man. I tell you these guys are out <br>
to _help_ me!)<br>
But it is one of many tools and dispositions.<br>
<p>
IMO, we all have hopes that we cherish. Even confidence that we will all <br>
one day see a better world for ourselves, our friends, our families, our <br>
loved ones. Expectations that we will one day challenge and conquer <br>
Unreasoning Death.<br>
<p>
But, it's still nothing more than hope.<br>
<p>
So, my questions are; What is your defintion of optimism? What role does <br>
optimism play in Extropian Philoshphy? Is there such a thing as too much <br>
optimism? What about when optimism turns into blind faith, or <br>
unreasonable hopes? If this were a *game* and optimism was an attribute, <br>
how would you value it against other attributes? Would it be more <br>
valuable or less than diplomacy, charisma, strength or Machivellian <br>
wiliness?<br>

		This comment reminded me of one of my favorite paranoia <br>
theories. (Because I rewrote it in my head, dropping the 'anti'. I <br>
probably should have mentioned that.) The government is intentionally <br>
distracting people with diversionary tactics and misinformation. OKC, TWA <br>
and OJ are all distractions from the stuff we should *really* be paranoid <br>
about.<br>
Hence...<br>
<p>
Pynchon's third proverb for paranoids --<br>
If they can get you asking the wrong questions they don't have to worry<br>
about the answers.<br>
<p>
BTW - Isn't dynamic optimism only a bone thrown to the starving dogs? It<br>
seems to be that the dynamically optimistic are often poor and the<br>
wealthy are never dynamically optimistic...<br>
<p>
-----<br>
			*They* _want_ you to be optimistic. It's all part <br>
of their plan. <br>

<p>
WHAT?!! Do you think Bill Gates or Warren Buffett is a stagnant <br>
pessimist?<br>
<p>
------<br>
<p>
			Howard Hughes, Claus Von Bulow. Not that they are <br>
necessarily 'stagnant pessimists,' though I might suggest they're more <br>
along the lines of dynamic pragmatists. Perhaps, simply, opportunists. <br>
They may seem more optimistic, but could that be because they're a lot <br>
closer to being in 'the Best of All Possible Worlds' than most of us?<br>
<p>

MM continues...<br>
<p>
The long-term poor (i.e. not the poor who are working hard at becoming <br>
rich)are generally either passive optimists or pessimists.<br>

They are also either male or female. BTW, what happened to the dynamic <br>
pessimist?<br>

HAHAHAHA I didn't _even want_ to reply to this one because I _knew_ that<br>
Max would handle the attack. hehe :)<br>
<p>

<p>
Finally, thanks to the ubiquitous smiley face, I realize that Chris meant <br>
'attack' in only the most pleasant, optimistic manner. (Why did he say <br>
that? I bet he's out to help me.)<br>
<p>
epilog -- (Ira Brodsky's Nyah Nyah post reprinted because it helped me <br>
put things in perspective)<br>
<p>
A related note (not specific to David Musick or John Clark)...<br>
<p>
I joined this list hoping it would prove an island of enlightenment.  I<br>
don't mean a place where everyone agrees with *me* -- I mean a place <br>
where<br>
people are committed to progress and willing to thoroughly test out new<br>
ideas.  That requires beating the !#%! out of ideas without getting<br>
personally bent out of shape.<br>
<p>
Hey, if you can make my ideas look foolish because you have more/better<br>
information or have attained a higher level of intellectual development, <br>
go<br>
right ahead.  You are helping me.  While I prefer you dispense a little<br>
encouragement to me as you tear my pet theories to shreds, doing so is<br>
purely optional.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, in the short time I have been here I have witnessed at <br>
least<br>
three incidents in which people have stormed out of debates saying "If<br>
that's the only way you can discuss this, let's not discuss it at all!"<br>
<p>
Yes, ad hominem arguments prove nothing.  They deserve to be exposed and<br>
dispensed with.  So just do it.  But truly enlightened thinkers are not <br>
so<br>
easily wounded.<br>
<p>
Upward!, Outward!...<br>
<p>
...And get over it already, OK?<br>
<p>
<p>
(Thanks Ira)<br>
<p>
To sum up-<br>
Just what the hell is Dynamic Optimism? How does it help you? Is it <br>
genetic or can you learn it? Did you learn it? If so, how? How would you <br>
go about teaching someone to be dynamically optimistic?<br>
<p>
Love,<br>
