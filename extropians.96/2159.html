&lt;&lt;  Hence the decentralization. There is a different atmosphere working for <br>
 each other rather than working for some faceless <br>
 state/corporation. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
BREAKTHROUGH:  I finally _agree_ with you on something.  Thank you for this<br>
wonderful decentralization idea.  The only problem is you did NOT go FAR<br>
enough.<br>
<p>
You have hit on a very good point: 100% decentralization.  Here is the idea.<br>
. . <br>
<p>
The greatest idea I've ever heard is when people realize that:  We Are All<br>
Self-Employed.  We all work for ourselves.  Your are _right_ we should 100%<br>
decentralize all the way down to the individual self employment.  When we<br>
take this optimistic view,  we stop working as a "slave" or working "for"<br>
anyone else.  Nobody works even for "each other".   We ALL work for<br>
_ourselves_ NOT for ANYONE ELSE.  NOT EVEN for "our fellow man".  <br>
<p>
Working for "our fellow man" is also slavery, right?  Working for a a<br>
faceless corporation is THE SAME AS working for a mass of unknown and<br>
possibly lazy "fellow men".   <br>
<p>
I finally agree with you on something.  Thank you for this wonderful<br>
decentralization idea.  The only problem is you did NOT go FAR enough.<br>
