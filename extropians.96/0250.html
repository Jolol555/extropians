Does anyone know of any studies (preferably with good methodology) analyzing<br>
possible psychological differences between persons born the traditional way<br>
vs. those born by Caesarian section?<br>
<p>
Some psychoanalysts make claims about the traumatic effects of birth. I'd<br>
like to see some evidence.<br>
<p>
I'm also curious as to whether, if there is anything in the claims that such<br>
early experiences affect adult psychology, the birth experience could<br>
explain the frequent reports of a tunnel in near death experiences. The NDE<br>
experience of travelling down a tunnel into the light suggests the<br>
possibility of a replaying of the birth experience. One way to investigate<br>
this would be to see if all people having such an NDE were born the typical<br>
way. If so, we'd have a nice explanation of the basic near death experience.<br>
<p>
I suspect that the actual explanation is more likely to be in terms of<br>
traumatic chemical events in the brain inducing experiences common to all<br>
cultures due to shared brain features. There are certain common patterns<br>
experienced by everyone on psychedelics regardless of their cultural<br>
background. One of these is a tunnel-like effect. This might be the same<br>
effect generated in NDE's.<br>
<p>
Anyone know of any studies in the area? The NDE is a common argument for the<br>
possibility of life after death. I'm interested in strengthening arguments<br>
against the NDE claim for believing in an afterlife.<br>
