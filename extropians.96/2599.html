<i>&gt; What you say above and what you say below can't both be right. I think what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you say above is correct.</i><br>
<p>
But the key word is COPY.  COPY COPY COPY COPY. as opposed to ORIGINAL.<br>
I think what you are trying to say is that a copy is as good as the real<br>
thing, bit it isnt in the view of the original, as the original is STILL<br>
stuck in the body, if it is a nondestructive flash copy job, or dead if<br>
it is a destructive copy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;You have not presented any evidence that if I were to do a</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;flash upload, that my "stream of consciousness" that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;consider to be "me" would not cease, even though there would</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;be a perfectly operating electronic copy of me insisting that</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;it feels fine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not so, I presented excellent evidence that I am still alive after I am fast</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploaded, namely I produced something that has my memories, acts just like me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and insists that he is indeed me.  As good as this evidence is, I admit it</i><br>
<i>&gt; falls short of a proof. You will NEVER be able to prove that my upload,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast or slow, has my consciousness, but then, you can't even prove I had</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness before the upload, just as I can NEVER prove you are conscious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nobody worries about being the only conscious being in the universe because in</i><br>
<i>&gt; our hart every human being on this planet takes it as an axiom of existence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that when something act's intelligent it is conscious. For the same reason,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't worry about an upload who act's just like me not being me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;I believe that the technology for slow gradual uploads will</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;develop much sooner than a flash upload capability.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that a destructive upload would probably be easier to do than</i><br>
<i>&gt; a non destructive one.</i><br>
<p>
A flash upload will basically need to scan our entire brains down to the<br>
quantum level in an instant, while a slow upload would consist of slowly<br>
adding more and more capacity and augmentation to the existing brain,<br>
until the mind has grown to the point where it would not notice if that<br>
old slow bioware suddenly developed some bad sectors (Alzheimers) and<br>
got corrupted and erased (dead). Many individuals and companies are<br>
working on the technologies now to accomplish this in various ways,<br>
while the flash upload is more of a science fantasy concept that belongs<br>
with Star Trek teleporters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Frankly, you sound more like a religious  dogmatic, willing</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;to take a leap of faith, than I.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I honestly don't know what more I can do. I examine 2 physical systems, I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; find absolutely no difference in them, I conclude there is no difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Where is the faith? If There is no physical difference, and you say you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in superstitious mumbo jumbo, then the question remains, what exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the difference?</i><br>
<p>
I just described the big difference between the two. The leap of faith<br>
is trusting that even though your brain is gonna get fried in the<br>
process, the copy of you is still YOU and not a copy that thinks its<br>
you. There IS a difference. Frankly I couln't care if it was you or a<br>
copy of you, but I'm sure that the original you would be quite perturbed<br>
to get halfway through having his brain fried to figure out its not such<br>
a good idea.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Tell me: Are you so positive that you would flash upload</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;this instant, given the chance?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; YES! In a heartbeat.</i><br>

Will the real John Clark please stand up?<br>
