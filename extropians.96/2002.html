Why do you look at the worker / employer relationship as though one person is <br>
above another?  From my perspective, they are on equal ground.  They are two <br>
people simply making a trade.  One person has their work to trade for money, <br>
and the other person wants to trade money for work.  I prefer to look at <br>
people as though they are all self-employed, and the people they work for are <br>
their clients.  For example, if I am a skilled factory worker, I can sell my <br>
services to various factory owners, who would then be my clients.  I want <br>
money, they want some work done; we both agree on the price, and we then <br>
exchange our wares; I trade my work for the factory owner's money.  I don't <br>
see where any one is being "screwed" in this process.<br>
<p>
One of the things I do to earn money is tutor students at the University of <br>
Utah in math.  When I'm tutoring someone, they are my employer, and I am the <br>
worker.  Would you say I am being "screwed" by them?  Are they taking unfair <br>
advantage of me?  Is the fundamental relationship here one of slavery?  Are <br>
you saying I am their slave? I view them as my clients, and they view me as <br>
someone who can help them do well in their math class.  No one is being <br>
"screwed".  <br>
