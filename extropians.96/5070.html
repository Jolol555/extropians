A while back there was a thread on molecule-scale refrigerators.<br>
Did anyone mention endothermic reactions?   These happen in liquid-<br>
phase chemistry but I'm sure you could make them in machine-phase.<br>
Here the idea is that you bump a pair of molecules and they say "thanks"<br>
and go into a higher energy state and stay there.  So the bump is<br>
absorbed.  Then the problem is to carry away the bumped molecules and<br>
bring in unbumped ones.<br>
<p>
Also, did anyone mention the connection between reversable computers and<br>
cooling?  In some of these circuits, you have to feed known values--<br>
strings of zeroes--into some inputs (corresponding to coolant), and<br>
you get essentially noise bits on some outputs (corresponding to waste<br>
heat).  But the "bits" in some physical models of gates are just different<br>
movement states of molecules, so I always thought the analogy ought to<br>
work backwards.<br>
<p>
In other words, you would shift molecules in a known state into contact<br>
with the thing you wanted to cool, it would interact with them, and you<br>
would shift the perturbed molecules away.  Better yet would be a way<br>
to transfer the changed state along a string of unmoving molecules,<br>
say by something like lasing, where one molecule would drop back to its<br>
lowest energy state, releasing a photon or phonon, and putting the next<br>
molecule in the high energy state, all in a clocked, directed way...<br>
<p>
Seth Lloyd has cool designs for molecular computers made out of regular<br>
crystals, where light pulses from outside prompt interactions between<br>
neighboring (groups of) atoms in the lattice.  If you have molecules of<br>
three types in a row, like ABCABCABC..., the different reactions are sort<br>
of catalized by different frequencies of light, so you can trigger AB<br>
reactions, then BC, then CA, etc., and you have a shift register.<br>
<p>
I think any refrigerator is limited by how finely it can<br>
distinguish and carry away information about different states of the thing<br>
it's cooling.<br>
