Finding my self in the throws of family holiday plans I have been, of course,<br>
"against" the Christ- mas thing once again...<br>
<p>
But yesterday I was telling my sister (our whole family is atheist, but<br>
always did the Christmas tree etc) how they shouldnt have to buy a present<br>
for me and she looked at me with mock suspicion and said: <br>
"Are you against capitalism, Nadi? <br>
I laughed... " No!"<br>
She said , "*That's* what this is all about...This hasnt been about Christ<br>
for years!""<br>
<p>
So this morning I decided (as Queen of everything) that it would be a good<br>
thing if we had a special day just for celebrating capitalism...<br>
<p>
I could give a shit about Newtons birthday (or any dead guy I never knew for<br>
that matter) but capitalism is something I DO care about..<br>
<p>
; - )<br>
<p>
Merry Capitalists' Day everyone!<br>
<p>
