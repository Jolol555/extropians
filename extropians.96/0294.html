I'm beginning to think that the more general and recent the term or<br>
concept, the more it can be understood only within an understanding of the<br>
tradition within which the term or concept arose.<br>
<p>
The problem with "spontaneous order" as a principle is that it arose,<br>
mostly in the works of F. A. Hayek, quite recently in history. It arose so<br>
recently that it's difficult to precisely identify the tradition to which<br>
it belongs. The tradition to which it belongs is a fuzzy subset of the<br>
Western scientific-liberal tradition, but if challenged, I might be able to<br>
point out some examples of members of the Western scientific-liberal<br>
tradition that are not part of the tradition to which the concept of<br>
spontaneous order belongs, and other examples that are part of that<br>
tradition. But I have no idea how to generalize about the boundary of this<br>
particular subset of the Western scientific-liberal tradition.<br>
<p>
Except that it seems to like Max and Tom's ideas and seems to be in the<br>
process of naming itself "extropian".<br>
<p>
I have no idea whether this comment is helpful to you or not. Lots of<br>
people who have attempted to be generalists, who have been exposed to this<br>
idea, and who have studied biology, economics, neural networks, and the<br>
many other disciplines that study complex homeostatic dynamic systems, have<br>
connected the idea of spontaneous order to their own personal conception of<br>
the good. But as usual, idolatry is always a danger. It seems increasingly<br>
clear that the phrase "spontaneous order" is easily misunderstood and<br>
misinterpreted at present.<br>
<p>
What to do about this, I do not know. One thing one could do is try to<br>
identify the allied concepts that are associated with the idea of<br>
spontaneous order (rich and extensive use of *local* information,<br>
accumulation and gradual modification of information over time, softness<br>
and flexibility) and do some education, so that this concept can emerge<br>
unscathed into the wider intellectual world and stand independent of the<br>
tradition that created it. Another thing one could do is to cease using the<br>
term and try to come up with other words and phrases for getting the same<br>
concept across in a less easily distorted form. I'm confident that<br>
different people will try different strategies, and through this<br>
experimentation eventually we'll figure out how to most effectively<br>
communicate the stuff that's important for each of us to communicate.<br>
<p>
I hope that made sense.<br>
