as do i... but i've learned to live with it ;-)<br>

<p>
I think there are more approaches than just the 'musically technical' for<br>
how to define 'quality' music, innovation, experimentalism or just stuff<br>
that works, on a musical structure level, on an originality of sound level<br>
etc.. Some of the music you like, i would define as quality music, even<br>
though i wouldn't on a technical level. There's also a degree of relativity<br>
in judging music 'Ace of Base' was not only sold to a specifically dance<br>
music audience, to such an audience this music may have been very original,<br>
experimental and innovative. Look at it this way: Nitzer ebb is considered<br>
innovative by those who never heared of DAF... 'Quality' is a very relative<br>
and personal term. As to ace of base not being of superior quality, musical<br>
technically, i think most people will agree on that. But then again, i know<br>
a lot of musical technically high 'quality' music that lacks that quality in<br>
many other ways...      <br>
