Mr. Clark, you have done it again.  For a while, you seemed to be<br>
discussing things like an adult, so I started answering this message and<br>
got sucked in before realizing you had returned to form.  After this,<br>
please don't bother me again.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Power exists in society (fortunately, I'd hate to live in a powerless world)</i><br>
<i>&gt;and like matter, energy, information, and everything else in the  Universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is not distributed evenly; after all, we've known for more than a century</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the aether does not exist. Raging against power centers is like raging</i><br>
<i>&gt;against electromagnetism.</i><br>
<p>
Utter sophistry!  With broad, sweeping, philosophical arm-wavings you<br>
dismiss the great struggle of human civilization -- how to forge a society<br>
that encourages all humans to both compete and cooperate in ways that<br>
liberate us to achieve maximum creativity, success and happiness.<br>
Throughout history, basic human nature made this seem hopeless, because<br>
power centers routinely conspired and made coups for their own reproductive<br>
benefit.  But WE have shown that it is profoundly possible to encourage<br>
human competitiveness within  groundrules that prevent tyranny.  The<br>
contrast between contemporary America, which practices the accountability I<br>
preach, and the AynRand scenario you propose,  which leads to the feudalism<br>
of every other human civilization, is like day and night.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's forget about morality for a minute and talk a little about</i><br>
<i>&gt;practicality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The government has shown that it is utterly incapable of stopping even</i><br>
<i>&gt;something as concrete as an object from coming into the country, an object</i><br>
<i>&gt;like hundreds of tons of cocaine or many thousands of tons of cannabis.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Encryption is just Mathematics and PGP is not an object, it's a sequence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;bits. If you can't even stop objects from entering the nation how on earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;are you going to stop bits, bits that can be duplicated endlessly at no cost,</i><br>
<i>&gt;bits that can be easily and very effectively hidden, bits that can make use</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the new communication channels that open up daily to every part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet? Like it or not the world is changing, learn to live with it.</i><br>
<p>
I have never said that I'd ban encryption.  But aside from necessary<br>
exceptions such as e-cash, grownups will leave it for  paranoid little boys<br>
to play with.  Our sieves will note anonymous screamers and cull them from<br>
the in-box.  When ubiquitous cameras top every streetlamp, we will walk<br>
under them unafraid, and use them to spot/identify Rand-ites shitting on<br>
the sidewalk... and tell their mothers.  Over the course of time, without<br>
Singaporean lashings, people will behave better for one simple reason,<br>
because girls and women understand accountability on a deep visceral level.<br>
(Though adolescent males love deaming of a world in which they can shit on<br>
sidewalks and get away with it.)<br>
<p>
Women won't want to spend time around liars and secrecy-fetishists.<br>
<p>
That is the world that's coming, so YOU learn to live with it!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll make a deal with you, if you don't call "privacy" my mantra I won't call</i><br>
<i>&gt;"accountability" yours.</i><br>
<p>
I don't give a flying %^&amp;$%^ if you call accountability my mantra.  In the<br>
present context, at the present time, it pretty well IS my slogan, since so<br>
many beneficiaries of accountability have forgotten what it's done for<br>
them.  (I'd love to see you try to survive in any other culture.  95% of<br>
the libertarians I know would be galley slaves within days.)<br>
<p>
Re: using PGP to fight a tyranny, you say:<br>
<i>&gt;First of all, I could communicate, send money, even sign contracts with my</i><br>
<i>&gt;correspondents without them knowing my location or true name and without me</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowing theirs,</i><br>
<p>
I have never seen such profound naivete, or ignorance of how gestapos work.<br>
You have absolutely no practical evidence to support this fantasy.  The<br>
KGB would have you in minutes.<br>
<p>
<p>
 but there's a broader issue here.<br>
<i>&gt;You're postulating a nightmare 1984  type society, and I'm saying that recent</i><br>
<i>&gt;advances in communication and encryption are the very things that will stop</i><br>
<i>&gt;it from happening, long before things have degenerated to such a sorry state.</i><br>
<p>
Secrecy on your part will have nothing whatsoever to do with stopping some<br>
elite from establishing a dictatorship.  Only accountability-in-advance can<br>
do that.  Again, you are wasting my time arm-waving so I will now get rude<br>
and capitalize my point.<br>
<p>
PUT UP OR SHUT UP!   TELL ME WHEN AND WHERE IN HUMAN HISTORY THAT MASKS<br>
WORN BY LITTLE GUYS EVER ACCOMPLISHED SQUAT TO PREVENT BIG GUYS WITH SWORDS<br>
FROM TAKING OVER!<br>
<p>
You cannot.  You will not.  Every case in which freedom thrived happened by<br>
denying potential power centers their ability to conspire and make coups.<br>
Dats the fack that repudiates every  gesticulation and arm-waving<br>
<p>
Now please leave me alone until you can back up this AynRand libertarian<br>
drivel with even a single example.  I'm a grownup and I have things to do.<br>
