<i> &gt; The last time FDA was "talking" about more restrictions </i><br>
<i> &gt; i.e.  vitamins as having prescription drug status, they had their </i><br>
<i> &gt; telephone lines clogged for weeks with irate citizens.  </i><br>
<i> &gt; They backed down.  </i><br>
 <br>
 Why were they talking about that in the first place?  Where are they <br>
 coming from?  <br>

They were coming from the old idea that the public wanted "better safe than<br>
sorry" from big brother government.  And, from an over reaction to their mess<br>
ups of the past.  Those mess ups got them in to hot water with the "approved<br>
drugs" that caused birth defects.  The public panicked and politically<br>
correct congress slapped the FDA with all sorts of trouble for not being<br>
harsh enough.<br>
<p>
The FDA was not reading the public wind right with vitamins.  So they got<br>
slapped again, this time from the public, for being too harsh.  You just<br>
can't win when you try to regulate something.<br>
