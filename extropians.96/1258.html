Ibogaine is a drug / botanical that Extropians should know about <br>
as it is a powerful agent for positive personal change. Recently shown<br>
in a very positive light on the Discovery Channel program "Innovations,"<br>
it has the remarkable ability to halt drug addictions, in many cases,<br>
in only one single use. This has been demonstrated in research the <br>
world over. Yet this drug addiction curing drug has been generally<br>
repressed by The Establishment -- i.e., the powers that be. But <br>
even generally, Ibogaine seems to end any form of habituated <br>
behavior -- hell, maybe it could even get me to stop <br>
going on about A + not-A. ;^) ...then again. %^)<br>
<p>
Below, Aron Kay, famous pie-throwing Yippie, guides us to Internet<br>
resources for more info on Ibogaine.  Below that, I talk about <br>
the experience of a friend who took Ibogaine and then I go <br>
into the threat this drug posses to The Establishment, and more...<br>

<i>&gt; on the Ibogaine web page (<a href="http://www.Desk.nl">http://www.Desk.nl</a>).  This article has a section</i><br>
<i>&gt; that deals with Naranjo's work for the use of Ibogaine in psychotherapy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the use of Iboga (Tabernanthe iboga) an ibogaine containing plant used in</i><br>

<p>
<p>
   IAN: This is also one reason why Ibogaine is suppressed: it <br>
   causes a "trip." As I understand form having interviewed a <br>
   friend who took it, it causes one to  "step outside"  one's <br>
   life and see the whole; see what steps one could have taken; <br>
   see how the steps one did take lead to the various conditions <br>
   one now faces; how future steps can lead to future outcomes and <br>
   how one can have control of one's own destiny.  These insights <br>
   are reported as major personal breakthroughs leading to positive <br>
   change, growth and hope for the future. Along with freedom from <br>
   past habituated patterns, Ibogaine opens the door to a "new you."<br>
<p>
   Ibogaine seems to be -- as many psychedelic drugs are reported <br>
   to be -- a "teacher drug." And its potential for abuse is very <br>
   low, since, as I understand, its effects become nil with constant <br>
   exposure, and also, like other psychedelic agents, it can be very <br>
   exhausting. It's important to note that the powerful psychedelic <br>
   drug LSD was also shown to brake drug addiction. [1]<br>
<p>
   The Establishment cannot allow the knowledge that states <br>
   of mind outside the control of the State might be beneficial <br>
   to the individual. Ibogaine, with its proven ability to lead <br>
   to positive change, is a key drug in this respect. It stands <br>
   as an  example that the  psychedelic  experience  is itself <br>
   associated with healing, and they can't let that information <br>
   get out. The State alone must control the mind of the people. <br>
   Drug control is by definition mind control. Self-control of <br>
   drugs is a direct threat to the mind control of the masses.<br>
<p>
   Ibogaine can be a key not only to freedom from addiction <br>
   to drugs, but freedom from addiction to drug laws.<br>

REFERENCE  &amp;  IMPORTANT FACTS ________________________________<br>
<p>
[1] "Nearly a thousand hard-core alcoholics received high-dose<br>
LSD treatment at Weyburn Hospital, and the rate of recovery was<br>
significantly higher than for other forms of therapy -- an <br>
astounding 50%."  ACID DREAMS: The CIA, LSD and the Sixties<br>
Rebellion, Grove Weidenfeld, NY, 1985, p.49-50.<br>
<p>
"Originally tested on alcoholic in Canada with remarkable results,<br>
high-dose [ LSD ] therapy was subsequently applied to a wide range<br>
diagnostic categories: juvenile delinquency, narcotics addiction, <br>
severe character neurosis,... " Ibid., p. 57.  On p. 57-8 we find:<br>
<p>
      "The CIA was not interested in the therapeutic <br>
      application of LSD. The men of  ARTICHOKE  and<br>
      MK-ULTRA  [ CIA operations ]  defined the drug <br>
      as an anxiety-producing agent, and they realized <br>
      it would be relatively easy to "brake" a person <br>
      exposed to highly stressful stimuli while high <br>
      on acid. .... CIA and military interrogators <br>
      proceeded to utilize the drug as an instrument <br>
      of psychological torture."  <br>
<p>
Did you know that prior to assassination, Senator Robert Kennedy <br>
stated in opposition to govt halting of LSD therapeutic research: <br>
<p>
      "I think that we have given too much emphasis and <br>
      so much attention to the fact that it [ LSD ] can <br>
      be dangerous and that it can hurt an individual <br>
      who uses it... that perhaps to some extent we have <br>
      lost sight of the fact that it can be very, very <br>
      helpful in our society if used properly."  p. 93. <br>
<p>
Obviously this man had to go, for, indeed it would be helpful but <br>
this must be so only for The Establishment. This requires keeping <br>
it out of the hands of the people. Only those who wish to use it <br>
for torture and mind control should control this powerful agent.<br>
<p>
I highly recommend the book ACID DREAMS, by Martin Lee and Bruce<br>
Shlain, quoted above. It's a shocking and comprehensive review of <br>
the significant impact of this drug on both society and secret govt-<br>
CIA operations. It covers virtually all that is known about the CIA's <br>
extensive research into LSD as a tool for torture and mind control.<br>
This book has mega-doses of information every American should know,<br>
such as a super-hallucinogen the govt has at the ready in case  <br>
the people attempted to overthrow the govt by force.<br>
