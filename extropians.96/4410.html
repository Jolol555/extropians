You don't need to -- the new IPv6 standard includes packet-level<br>
encryption for all data passing over a link, and I think that DES is the<br>
*least* secure encryption algorithm included in the standard. At this<br>
point the main things preventing most Internet traffic being encrypted are<br>
patents and export laws. There's already an alpha-release for Linux, some<br>
early versions of routers, and if encrypted IPv6 appears in Windows the<br>
amount of encrypted traffic will increase a million-fold almost overnight. <br>
<p>

Seriously, unless the US government ban encryption in the next couple of<br>
years it's going to be so ubiquitous that they'll never be able to control<br>
it. Of course encryption != privacy, but one definitely supports the<br>
other. <br>
<p>
Incidentally this thread fits in with a discussion I had with Steve Mann<br>
(<a href="http://wearcam.org">http://wearcam.org</a>), one of my net.acquaintances from the technomads<br>
list, when I visited MIT a few weeks ago -- he actually supports both<br>
sides in some respects. He's so upset about public surveillance that he's<br>
built several wearable video cameras (in sunglasses or T-shirts) which he<br>
can carry around and which broadcast direct to the Internet. He takes<br>
great pleasure in surveilling the surveillers, who get distinctly upset<br>
when they know that anyone on the Web can see what they're doing. I did<br>
suggest that he wrote an article for Extropy about his gear and<br>
experiences, but I'd rather see all the cameras eliminated. <br>
<p>
Could I suggest that all the pro-surveillance people on the list go out<br>
and set up WebCams around their houses? It doesn't cost that much these<br>
days, and would go a long way to convince people that your arguments are<br>
serious. I mean, what do you have to hide?<br>
