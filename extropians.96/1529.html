On 9/29/96 I wrote about Reilly Jones' "apparent notion that anyone who<br>
speaks must do so with 100% certainty."<br>
<p>
On 10/01/96 Reilly responded: "You may back this up with the appropriate<br>
quote from me, showing where I even remotely asserted this.  I don't<br>
recognize it in the slightest."<br>
<p>
Reilly never asserted any such thing.<br>
<p>
But, just to explain where I was coming from, on 9/24/96 Reilly did<br>
write:<br>
"The distinction between certainty and uncertainty is digital. You are<br>
either certain or you are uncertain....  The instant you have a doubt<br>
about something, you are uncertain."<br>
And ...<br>
In the context of a discussion about 'junk' on the list, and while<br>
pondering the the difficulty of philosophical discussion without using<br>
ambiguous terms, of making clear but concise statements of one's ideas,<br>
of avoiding divergence, of misinterpreting another's arguments, I<br>
diverged big-time and improperly linked Reilly's 9/24 statement, plus<br>
the idea that tolerance is indifference, with _my own_ thought that, if<br>
any of these can get you classified as a nihilist or imbecile or<br>
junk-poster, then the implication must be that it's better not to speak<br>
out if you're uncertain.<br>
<p>
Just to be clear (so we can move on to more productive discussions), my<br>
'apparent notion' was just that, mine, and was improperly attributed to<br>
Reilly.<br>
<p>
Reilly also added: "[G]o back and read my posts, I have included a<br>
wealth of constructive ideas, and constructive sources to pursue.  If<br>
you only want to dwell on the negative, that's your perogative, but it<br>
doesn't make the positive nonexistent."<br>
<p>
A most 'incisive' point!<br>
