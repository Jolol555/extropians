<i>&gt; You misunderstand the nature of modern cryptography.  </i><br>
<p>
If you guys don't cut out the wise-ass remarks, I'm going to chase you <br>
around the playground and beat you up!    &lt;g&gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  *Many* common encryption algorithms today could not be broken </i><br>
<i>&gt; even if the entire GNP of the country was applied towards </i><br>
<i>&gt; computational capability.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, no amount of budget would allow the NSA to crack </i><br>
<i>&gt; an IDEA encrypted message.  There isn't enough computational </i><br>
<i>&gt; capability available.  </i><br>
<p>
Why is it so hard to get this across?  I'm *not* saying that they can <br>
decode an encrypted message.   I'm *not* saying they can reconstruct <br>
the algorithm that generated an encrypted message.  <br>
<p>
Eugene Leitl proposes to make routine low-overhead encryption part of <br>
TCP/IP.  I am only claiming that NSA can tell the difference between <br>
an encrypted message generated by such a routine algorithm, and one <br>
generated by a more sophisticated algorithm.  Not that they can read the <br>
messages, just that they can tell which is which.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A good pseudo-random number generator is indistinguishable </i><br>
<i>&gt; from a true set of random numbers.  The RC4 stream cipher (= PRNG) </i><br>
<i>&gt; is a case in point.  The output has a totally white spectrum.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only thing that makes it "pseudorandom" is that it is generated </i><br>
<i>&gt; deterministically.  The output is indistinguishable from </i><br>
<i>&gt; non-deterministic random noise.  </i><br>
<p>
Is that a theorem?  Are you saying that trying to distinguish between <br>
these outputs is like trying to find a rational number whose square is 2?  <br>
<p>
If it's not a theorem -- and I don't think it is -- then I wouldn't be <br>
too quick to assert that it is *impossible* to distinguish between <br>
different kinds of pseudorandomness.  I could be wrong, but my <br>
mathematical common sense tells me that each algorithm leaves <br>
some kind of fingerprint, and distinguishing between them is <br>
just a matter of cleverness and patience.  <br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First a clue for Lyle: Cryptography has always been classified as</i><br>
<i>&gt; munitions.  </i><br>
<p>
Really?  Always?  As recently as the 1930s, the attitude of the <br>
American government was that "gentlemen don't read each other's <br>
mail."  But thanks for the clue, Mike.   Now nobody can say I'm <br>
clueless.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The day a spy agency like NSA gets such status and budget will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; the beginning of the Second AMerican Civil War.  </i><br>
<p>
Nope.  That's a totally naive statement.  <br>
<p>
John Novak writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tell me, do you know something I don't regarding the operational</i><br>
<i>&gt; standing of the NSA and governmental plans for the same, or are</i><br>
<i>&gt; you just painting a paranoid nightmare scenario for the sheer joy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to spook people?  </i><br>
<p>
I'm just painting a paranoid nightmare scenario for the sheer joy of <br>
trying to spook people!   &lt;evil g&gt; <br>
<p>
What I am doing -- not in this thread particularly, but in general -- is <br>
the opposite of encryption.  I am trying to decrypt my thoughts.  I am <br>
trying to create a vocabulary in which I can make myself understood.  <br>
The most subversive thing I can do is to tell the truth in plain English.  <br>
But first I have to establish a context within which my ideas will be <br>
intelligible.  This has been the purpose of all my posts from day one.  <br>
