<p>
        I'm very happy to see a statement like that on this list.  I agree<br>
completely.  People --rich or poor-- can only go as far as they want to go.<br>
Personally, I'll do everything within my power to protect and keep from<br>
hurting other people.  I'll do everything within my power to accept and love<br>
other people for their views, individuality etc.  *But* the bottom line is,<br>
that if any person gets in the way of my goals or hinders my progress, then<br>
that is too bad for them.  Ultimately, I am a selfish, capitalistic egoist,<br>
but I also try to be as considerate and compassionate as possible.  <br>
<p>
        I seem to have strayed a little off the topic.  A billionaire (or<br>
multi-millionaire for that matter) generally earns his\her money.  As Ira<br>
Brodsky alluded, Bill Gates isn't exactly using hundred dollar bills as<br>
toilet paper.  If the Microsoft Corporation suddenly went belly-up, Mr.<br>
Gates would no longer be worth billions; probably not even millions.  Good<br>
old Bill would be fairly broke.  My point?  The term 'billionaire' seems to<br>
make the laymen of the day scowl and grumble about how horrible a<br>
billionaire is.  "If he gave away half of his money, we'd all be eating a<br>
little better." is a sentence that I have heard repeatedly.  But if Bill<br>
gave away half his money, half of us wouldn't be able to hear that glorious<br>
'da-daaa' when we start Windows 6.0!  Billionaires *earn* their money.  I<br>
believe they set a good example for the rest of the world.  Unfortunately,<br>
most people can't quite see it that way.  Too bad.<br>
