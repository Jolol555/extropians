<i>&gt;Uploads would probably desire a physical body of some kind.  In this case,</i><br>
<i>&gt;those with higher processing speeds would be better able to control multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt;bodies.  They would build up wealth and control more bodies.  The poor could</i><br>
<i>&gt;do this but it would take more time.  The same is true of our society today.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah but if you don't augment yourself fast enough you'll be left behind<br>
and archaic and eventually become incompatable with the operating system<br>
and die. Also uploaded beings with more power and processing speed will be<br>
able to augment faster than you and be many times more creative and<br>
intelligent than you and thus discover anything new in any material you<br>
could possibly have access to before you get there and thus never be able<br>
to climb the tree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My personal view is that individual identity will cease to have meaning in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;world of uploads.  Communication between individuals could be so complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;that one could not tell where one ends and the other begins.</i><br>
<p>
Ughh! I don't want to become a borganism.<br>
