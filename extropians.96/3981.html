<p>
 You can imagine conditions under which it turns out to have been a<br>
mistake. So what? Are you unable to imagine conditions under which<br>
your strategy is equally mistaken?<br>
 You sound obsessed. While it it probably a good thing for someone<br>
to be obsessed with cryopreservation research, your apparent expectation<br>
that others share your obsession is likely to hinder your fundraising<br>
efforts outside of the core group of cryonicists that you have already<br>
reached. Imagine how you would feel if someone told you that you were<br>
insane not to contribute to cancer research or airplane safety research.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If I am healthy enough that I will probably survive until uploading</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;investment that will help me more than a cryopreservation investment?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Statistically, you are correct concerning your likelihood of needing</i><br>

<i>&gt;that chance with something as important as your *life*?</i><br>
<p>
 Yes. I see no way of removing all risks to my life within the next decade,<br>
and that particular risk seems small compared to other risks, such as the<br>
risks associated with not being wealthy enough to protect myself against<br>
risks that I can't currently forsee.<br>
 (In case I wasn't clear enough, I was referring to donations to cryonics<br>
research. I recently signed up with Alcor. However, I think that a year<br>
ago I was insufficiently wealthy that it was wise of me to postpone signing<br>
up).<br>
