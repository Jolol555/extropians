LONGEVITY-DIGEST<br>
=09I would like to announce the creation of Longevity-Digest, an E-mail<br>
group devoted to the science of aging. I am Brian Rowley (BS, MS),<br>
owner and moderator.<br>
<p>

<p>
MISSION<br>
        Longevity-Digest is designed to bring together scientists and<br>
laypersons interested in diverse aspects of longevity science. Some<br>
will be molecular biologists, some endocrinologists, some life<br>
extensionists, some pharmacologists, some demographers...<br>
<p>
        The subject matter of this list is of great importance. Aging<br>
is the most important risk factor for almost all causes of death.<br>
Right now, medical science is trying to prolong healthy life chiefly<br>
by attacking disease directly. But at some point in life this approach<br>
serves only to prolong morbidity. We are unlikely to get beyond a life<br>
expectancy of 85 or so unless we treat the aging process itself<br>
(Olshansky, Carnes &amp; Cassel 1990). Furthermore, even without any life<br>
expectation gain, the benefits of preserving a youthful physiology are<br>
incalculable.<br>
<p>
=09There is some reason for hope that effective treatments for aging will<br>
be found in our lifetime. For example, there are studies of<br>
shorter-lived species that document successful interventions in the<br>
aging process: (1) caloric restriction with ample micronutrients<br>
prolongs the life span of long-lived rodents (those already resistant<br>
to the diseases of aging) and a phylogenetically diverse array of<br>
other species (e.g., rotifers, daphnia, spiders, fish....), by up to<br>
50% (Weindruch &amp; Walford 1988). (2) the clonal life span of paramecia<br>
can be increased 33% by consecutive treatments of damaging (nucleotide<br>
fusing) UV and undamaging (nucleotide splitting) UV. Damaging and<br>
undamaging the DNA is hypothesized to trick cells into mobilizing a<br>
reserve DNA repair capacity that can reverse age-accumulated damage<br>
(Smith-Sonneborn 1979). Such a reserve is probably enormous--how else<br>
to explain the complete reversal of senescence routinely seen in<br>
paramecia after fission and reconjugation; the same rejuvenation<br>
occurs each time a sperm combines with an egg, otherwise each new<br>
generation would be "older" than the last. (3) Liu &amp; Walford (1975)<br>
have found that lowering the body temperature of C. bellottii fish<br>
from 20 to 15 degrees Celsius adds over 80% to the life span. Complex<br>
metabolic changes, not simply a =93lowered metabolism=94, seem implicated.<br>
(4) Odens (1973) has found that weekly injections of RNA and DNA,<br>
starting at 750 days of life in rats that live 800-900 days, more than<br>
doubles survival to about 1800 days. (5) Combinations of daf-2 and<br>
daf-12 mutant alleles nearly quadruple the adult life span of C.<br>
elegans nematodes (Larsen, Albert &amp; Riddle 1995). As a result of these<br>
successes, it would be premature to conclude that nothing will ever be<br>
done about aging, and it is certainly true that underlying mechanisms<br>
of aging can be studied in a laboratory setting.<br>
<p>
=09Less mainstream researchers (e.g., life extensionists and cryonicists)<br>
are welcome along with more traditional scientists--in my view, good<br>
research is defined not only by tidy puzzle-solving and the amount of<br>
accumulated evidence, but also by potential application and importance<br>
to people's lives. As a result, scientists from both traditional and<br>
non-traditional areas are welcome.<br>
<p>
POSTING<br>
        To post a message to Longevity-Digest, send E-mail to<br>
Longevity-Digest@vm.ege.edu.tr. It is recommended that you subscribe<br>
first.<br>
<p>
ACTIVITIES<br>
        Each week, Longevity-Digest invites one or more "guest<br>
speakers" from various fields related to longevity to post a few<br>
paragraphs describing their work, or giving information, opinions or<br>
ideas. In fact, anyone can be a "guest speaker" simply by sending a<br>
post and initiating a thread. Replies to "guest speaker" posts, if<br>
numerous, are collected and amalgamated into an E-mail digest (all<br>
authorships acknowledged), which is then distributed to subscribers<br>
via E-mail. The "guest speaker" is given a copy of the digest, and can<br>
reply to the replies.<br>
<p>
        Exchanges on Longevity-Digest are less rapid-fire than on<br>
newsgroups, as posting can take from hours to days. However, junk is<br>
eliminated (see rules of moderation). The Longevity-Digest is also<br>
prepared to carry out subscribership polls on certain issues that<br>
wouldn't be possible with any other format, depending on subscriber<br>
interest.<br>
<p>
RULES OF MODERATION<br>
        "Spams" (advertisements), "flames" (personal attacks), swear<br>
words, vapid musings, unaddressable complaints, conspiracy theories,<br>
excessive verbiage, redundancies, rants and gibberish will not be<br>
posted. These rules allow much flexibility, while giving posters<br>
freedom from junk mail and abuse.<br>
<p>
        I also make 3 posting suggestions:<br>
<p>
        (1) Strong claims should come with a description of the<br>
supporting evidence.<br>
<p>
        (2) Opinions, speculation and theorizing should be presented<br>
as such; start sentences with "I think..." or "My hypothesis is...".<br>
<p>
        (3) Anecdotes can be given, but should not be asserted as<br>
proof.<br>
<p>
        Let me extend my warmest greetings to you. I am looking<br>
forward to making your acquaintance on Longevity-Digest, and I<br>
anticipate many exciting discussions :-&gt;<br>
<p>
