In the first Thread in HotWired's BrainTennis, I posted something which <br>
mentioned that rationality is a product of and in the process of evolution.  I <br>
also posted something to that effect here.  In BrainTennis, Alexander <br>
Chislenko posted something which disagreed with what I wrote, and since we <br>
were getting off the main topic of the Thread, I wrote to him privately, but I <br>
think some of you may be interested in what I wrote, so I'm posting it here:<br>
<p>
	<br>
	First of all, I am constantly amazed at my own rationality, and how quickly <br>
the processes of rationality can analyze a problem, evaluate partial solutions <br>
and eventually come up with a solution to the problem.  It's certainly much <br>
faster than blind trial-and-error, but I still maintain that rationality, as <br>
wonderful as it is, is still a product of evolution and constantly engaged in <br>
the process of evolution.<br>
	I understand rationality to be a very streamlined and efficient way of <br>
understanding things and thinking about things.  We didn't start out with this <br>
faculty, when we were born, but our minds keep fine-tuning themselves, through <br>
a process of evolution and selection, where the better ways of thinking <br>
consistently win out over inferior ways of thinking.  Ways of thinking that <br>
consistently bring the child a reward by getting the child what it wants will <br>
be reinforced in the child's mind.  This is the process of selection; the ways <br>
of thinking that can't make it through the selection process are discontinued. <br>
 Through schooling and other learning environments, children find themselves <br>
in situations where they must perform rationally to receive praise, and <br>
because they desire praise, they continue to refine their processes of <br>
rationality.  Our ancestors found themselves in situations where they had to <br>
perform rationally to just *survive* (and so do we, but it's just not as <br>
immediately obvious, and some of us can get away with extreme irrationality).<br>
	There was once an experiment done where humans' brain activity was monitored <br>
as they learned how to play the computer game, Tetris.  When they frist began <br>
playing, they played very poorly, and their brains were very active.  As they <br>
played, their performance improved and their brain activity decreased, until <br>
they played like experts and exhibited the same amount of brain activity as <br>
they did when they sat around doing nothing.  This is a good example of the <br>
mind refining itself and becoming more efficient at doing certain tasks.  It <br>
starts out using a tremendous amount of resources, all working on the problem, <br>
and through some kind of selection process, it only keeps the activities which <br>
have an appearantly desirable effect in solving the problem.  Until it ends up <br>
with a very advanced and efficient Tetris playing nodule.<br>
	I think that the same type of thing happens as our rational processes <br>
develop.  We start out with all kinds of possible ways to solve problems, and <br>
we don't know which ways are best, but as the various approaches try <br>
themselves out, they compete with each other, and the approaches which most <br>
consistently bring rewards are reinforced more than those which don't and <br>
eventually, the inefficient processes are discontinued altogether while the <br>
more successful ones are fully operative.<br>
	But, even though our rationality is an extremely efficient process, it is <br>
continually refining itself, at least in active minds.  I notice that my own <br>
rationality is constantly mutating into many different varieties,sometimes <br>
with very minor changes, sometimes with greater changes, and these variations <br>
are all subject to competition with each other, and the types of thinking <br>
which seem to work best are selected for and given more resources while <br>
appearantly inferior types of thinking are discontinued.<br>
	Recognizing that rationality is a product of and in a process of evolution <br>
doesn't make it any less good or praiseworthy.  On the contrary, it <br>
significantly improves my faith in my rational processes to know that they <br>
exist because they are the current winners of intense competition between <br>
various ways of thinking.  Yes, village life is more rational than jungle <br>
life, for the same reasons that an adult's mind is more rational than a <br>
child's mind.  They have simply gone further along the process of selection <br>
and evolution.<br>
	Just because something's evolutionary, doesn't mean that it starts over from <br>
ground-zero every time it tries to solve a problem.  Evolution bulids on <br>
itself, using existing processes to solve problems and continually refining <br>
itself through variation and selection.  Our rationality is definitely <br>
evolutionary (it is the product of evolution, and it is in a process of <br>
constant evolution and refinement).  It is many orders of magnitude faster and <br>
more powerful than genetic evolution, so I can understand your reluctance to <br>
include the two types of evolution as basically the same type of thing.  I <br>
think that the interconnectivity and the feedback loops are much tighter in <br>
the mind than in biology.  But I think that the same type of process is <br>
occuring in everything; the process of variation and selection, where <br>
processes which can't maintain themselves in relation to surrounding <br>
processes, simply don't continue.  These processes may be biological <br>
processes, where DNA mutates and variations appear in different organisms <br>
which compete for resources, or they may occur in the brain, where various <br>
patterns of activity either maintain themselves or are discontinued, or they <br>
may occur in the marketplace, as various products are exchanged and competing <br>
with each other.  There are many mediums where evolution can take place (and <br>
that's something the Artificial Life people are studying; creating <br>
evolutionary environments in computers).<br>
<p>
	Enough said; I think you get the idea.<br>
