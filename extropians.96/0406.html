<p>
Yes. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, then, would be a mutation or</i><br>
<i>&gt;a sequence of mutations that resulted in a nonlethal total failure of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;prokaryotic immune system. This notion seems sufficiently paradoxical to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I'm content, for the time being, to identify the jump from prokaryote</i><br>
<i>&gt;to eukaryote as the Great Filter.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds plausible to me, but I don't know this field very well.  I<br>
worry, though, in actuality cells might have slowly gone through many<br>
evolutionary steps over this period, steps that our fossil record and<br>
tools might be too coarse to make out.  It might just look like one<br>
big step because that's all we can see.  (Is this what William Lerette<br>
meant by his crypic comment?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The other possible counterargument, as Robin points out, is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;mutation took only two billion years (on Earth) to happen. But if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;prokaryotic panspermia idea is right, and there are prokaryotes as thick as</i><br>
<i>&gt;mud throughout the universe, then we could say that the Great Filter</i><br>
<i>&gt;mutation took more like ten to fifteen billion years to take place, </i><br>
<p>
Again, I'm no expert, but from reading Crick I got the strong<br>
impression that prokaryotic cells are much less robust to extreme<br>
environments, and much better tuned to the particulars of Earth now.<br>
<p>
Sigh - guess I need to read up on yet another relevant field to this<br>
very interdisciplinary subject.  :-)<br>
