Wow.  One of the times where I hope someone is being sarcastic at me<br>
because their being serious is much scarier... Your original point was<br>
right: you don't easily punch holes through blind faith.  But faith<br>
isn't about stupidity.  It's about taking something on faith, or perhaps<br>
not subjecting something to criticism or consistency checks.  Subjecting<br>
it to bad criticism won't help -- in fact it will give them good reasons<br>
for not listening to you any further.  Likewise you don't counter bad<br>
environmental arguments with bad counter-arguments.  <br>

A dream of a meme<br>

causes termites to teem<br>
or so it to me does seem.<br>
