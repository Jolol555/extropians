<i>&gt;A good post from Chris Hind, but I do disagree with one thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;The way I wish to be uploaded will be through gradual</i><br>
           <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;incremental uploading so that "I" will be the uploaded,</i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;virtual, digital, being rather than a digital duplicate</i><br>
              <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;running around as me. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A gradual upload might be a good idea for practical reasons, you could catch </i><br>
<i>&gt;any bugs in the procedure before they caused serious harm, but I don't see </i><br>
<i>&gt;how it would make any difference from a philosophical viewpoint. Since all </i><br>
<i>&gt;the atoms in our bodies are constantly changing and information is the thing </i><br>
<i>&gt;that makes me be me and you be you, I don't think it's meaningful to </i><br>
<i>&gt;differentiate between a "copy" and the "original" of a person. Are copies of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Windows 95 inferior to the "original", whatever that means?</i><br>
<p>
This sort of thing wouldn't disturb a non self-aware non conscious being<br>
such as a an animal but 'I' want to be the one inside the computer not a<br>
digital clone. So then what if there are two copies of 'me'? Which one is<br>
actually 'me'. I would state the original copy. If you killed me and then<br>
rebuilt me from different atoms it would still be the same person but the<br>
conscious self-aware 'me' that I have come to love.<br>
