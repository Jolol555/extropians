<i>&gt;people who want government to do everything for them, to provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;education, health-care, to make sure the drugs and other products they</i><br>
<i>&gt;buy are all tested and proven safe and so forth.  There are a huge</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of people who want to be taken care of, who want someone to</i><br>
<i>&gt;look out for them. ...  go a long way towards getting government out</i><br>
<i>&gt;of our lives and our wallets would be the formation of some companies</i><br>
<i>&gt;which provided for people all of the services which government tries</i><br>
<i>&gt;to provide, but does it cheaper and better than the government does.</i><br>
<i>&gt;...  There are private schools, private drug testing companies,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consumer Reports and so forth.  But people still want the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;to provide these services.  Why?  Most of the reason is probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;because people are simply used to the government doing that job and</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't want to change, but I think that another important reason is</i><br>
<i>&gt;because all of these private companies are separate companies, each</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing only their specialty.  What we need is several companies which</i><br>
<i>&gt;could each provide ALL the services the government provides, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps much more.  ...  I like to call these types of companies MOMM</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Management and Organization for the Mindless Masses).  </i><br>
<p>
You'll have to change the name if you want to get much busines :-).  I<br>
really doubt the problem is that these private services are now<br>
unbundled.  It would be really easy to bundle them, if there really<br>
were a market for it.  (If you think the market's making a big mistake<br>
here, go start a venture.)  A bigger problem is why should you pay for<br>
private health care, education, and consumer protection when you are<br>
already paying for the government versions, and can not stop paying?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;An agent from a MOMM company could approach a poor person and offer to</i><br>
<i>&gt;provide them with good, marketable skills, housing for them and their</i><br>
<i>&gt;family, food, security, health-care and so forth, if the poor person</i><br>
<i>&gt;contracted with the MOMM company to pay the MOMM company a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;percentage of their future income.  </i><br>
<p>
Bankruptsy law makes this impractical at present.  After you get them<br>
marketable skills, they declare bankruptsy and then never have to pay<br>
you again.<br>
