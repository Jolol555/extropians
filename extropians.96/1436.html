Peter C. McCluskey asks:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What will keep AI salaries noticeably greater than zero? </i><br>
<i>&gt; The supply of AI's will be, for most purposes, nearly unlimited. </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I can create a million copies of myself... </i><br>
<p>
If you made one copy of yourself, would the copy work for free?  If you <br>
were a copy, would you work for free?  What will keep AI salaries <br>
greater than zero is the fact that they will be (by hypothesis) our equals, <br>
and they will demand the same things we demand.  <br>
<p>
If you could make a million copies of yourself, how would that differ <br>
from our present situation?  The human race already makes a copy of <br>
itself, every generation.  Millions of new humans enter the work force <br>
every year.  The supply of entry-level workers is, for most purposes, <br>
nearly unlimited.  Why don't they work for free?   Why do they demand <br>
more compensation, as they move into jobs with more responsiblity?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I can create a million copies of myself, how hard would it be </i><br>
<i>&gt; to create my own Exxon?</i><br>
<p>
As hard as it is now.  You would still have to (1) conceive the project, <br>
(2) write a detailed business plan, (3) raise capital, (4) hire the copies, <br>
specify their jobs, train them, organize them into an efficient work <br>
force...    Everything you have to do now to create an Exxon <br>
would still have to be done if you were dealing with copies of yourself.  <br>
In other words, the situations are isomorphic.  <br>
<p>
