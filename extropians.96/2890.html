             In the tradition of Future Shock and Silent Spring -<br>
               Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds<br>
                       Sample chapters: <a href="http://www.charlesriver.com">http://www.charlesriver.com</a><br>
          ROCKLAND, Mass., Nov. 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Two best selling authors<br>
from<br>
very different backgrounds, Gregory Paul and Earl Cox, team up to present the<br>
scientific, sociological, and theological issues that we will face when<br>
brains<br>
are down loaded into receptacles and machines become better than humans.  The<br>
resulting book, Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds, is<br>
published<br>
by Charles River Media, Inc. (sample chapters: <a href="http://www.charlesriver.com">http://www.charlesriver.com</a>,<br>
price: $20.95):<br>
          *  Explains how the greatest revolution in Earth's history -- the<br>
replacement of human intelligence by cyber-intelligence -- will probably<br>
occur<br>
within the lifespan of many who are alive today;<br>
          *  Combines the knowledge of an evolutionary biologist and computer<br>
scientist to project the evolution of robotics and its effect on society;<br>
          *  Describes the ultimate Internet, the direct co-mingling of human<br>
consciousness in electronic computer systems.<br>
          *  Presents a realistic, often irreverent, look at the future of<br>
religion<br>
in the 21st century.<br>
          "This book argues that the next century will prove to be nothing<br>
like this<br>
one, nor any forecast so far.  Computing power, neuroscience, and<br>
nanotechnologies are advancing so rapidly that they will combine to produce<br>
the most significant evolutionary developments since the origin of life<br>
itself.<br>
          "We maintain that the human mind and conscious thought are<br>
exclusively<br>
natural and physical in origin and nature.  Ultimately, their natures and<br>
fundamental processes are knowable and can be replicated for the purposes of<br>
personal immortality." -- from Chapter 1: Down the Yellow Brick Road<br>
          The Authors<br>
    Gregory Paul, an evolutionary biologist, is both an artist of prehistoric<br>
life whose work was used in the movie Jurassic Park as well as an<br>
accomplished<br>
writer for such magazines as Scientific American, Science News, Nature and<br>
The<br>
Smithsonian.  His previous book, Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, is a best-<br>
seller and Book-of-the-Month Club selection.<br>
          Earl Cox is an international authority on the applications of<br>
artificial<br>
intelligence.  He is founder and president of The Metus Systems Group and<br>
regularly contributes to many AI periodicals and consults for many Fortune<br>
500<br>
companies including AmEx, Motorola and the FAA.<br>
          Pre-Publication Comments<br>
    "... In a time when technology advance is a hard driving army, it is most<br>
often ignored that the greatest advances come from the flanks.  Paul and Cox<br>
have captured the very essence of now-based potentials...  I shall refer to<br>
it<br>
many times."  Lee Kent Hempfling, Chairman/CEO Neutronics Technologies<br>
Corporation.<br>
