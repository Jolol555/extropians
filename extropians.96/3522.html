        Well, I've silently perused this thread for a few days now, and<br>
although there have been many thought-provoking and intriguing points on<br>
most the contributor's parts, I think the thread is a paradox.  Eliezer has<br>
made up a long and detailed letter --it is good-- but I must ask: why?  If<br>
the purpose of the letter is to convey extropy to the general population,<br>
then you are out of luck.  People will read the first few sentences, put the<br>
letter down, then turn on their television sets to watch the Yankees play<br>
the Mariners.  Note that I said *general* population.  I have no doubt in my<br>
mind that many people will understand the letter as it stands now --and<br>
agree with it, to boot-- *but* I seriously wonder how many will bother<br>
finding out more about extropy.<br>
<p>
        There have been many posts throughout the past three months dealing<br>
with *how* to convey extropy to "the general population".  Indeed, I have<br>
made quite a few contributions to these posts.  I could reiterate my views<br>
but, being the liberated individuals that we are, everyone will have<br>
different thoughts on the matter.  It all comes back to the question: "how<br>
can us extropians show humanity the necessity of individual progress?"<br>
(anyone recognize that question?).  Sure, Eliezer has a letter full of<br>
information and straight-forward 'memetic engineering', but will people<br>
really *want* to read that letter?  I, for one, am doubtful...realistically<br>
doubtful.<br>
<p>
        Kennita brought up an excellent point: people aren't going to cause<br>
change if they like things the way they are.  People who like watching the<br>
Yankees play the Mariners are going to continue watching the Yankees play<br>
the Mariners.  There are literally *millions* [generalization] of people who<br>
potentially would like to change 'THE WAY THINGS ARE', but not many are<br>
willing to put out the effort to *do* it.  Every day when I read the<br>
newspaper, I see articles devoted to some object of mass emotional pity.<br>
People in North America cry when they see the suffering in Bosnia, but when<br>
asked to do something about it, they'll respond: "well, *I'm* too busy" or<br>
"you can't change the world."  Let's apply this general 'meme' to how<br>
extropy would be viewed.  When told that they could help solve many of the<br>
world's woes by investing in nanotechnology or uploads, they'll respond: "I<br>
don't have the money" or "I don't know enough about it".  To no end will<br>
they [again, generally] see the profits.  When told about space colonies,<br>
they'll argue over the world's problems or economy.<br>
<p>
        This thread is inevitably a paradox.  What needs to happen is for<br>
people to find the profits of extropy on their own.  Don't take that the<br>
wrong way...I still think we should do all we can to promote it.  Now here<br>
is the crux of the post (the paradise within a paradox, so to speak): we<br>
*can* show people how to find it on their own.  I said I wasn't going to<br>
reiterate on my old posts, but I guess I lied.  I have said this numerous<br>
times, but I *know* that art is a sure way to increase people's awareness of<br>
extropy.  But not *just* art, anything that causes people to question.  It<br>
is the need to question that sparks potential, it is potential that<br>
eventually becomes kinetic.  People need to learn the profits of being<br>
open-minded, *then* we can do our part by showing and explaining the points<br>
of extropy.  Que sera sera...<br>
