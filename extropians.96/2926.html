The deep sea vents have single celled and multicelled organisms living in and<br>
next to them.  The extreme thermophilic bacteria live and grow at<br>
temperatures well above 100 degrees C.  I predicted these organisms (and<br>
bacterial life in space) would be discovered in 1975 when most other<br>
microbiologists disagreed with me.  Less than ten years later, the extreme<br>
thermophiles were discovered.  And, Mars may have had bacteria.<br>
<p>
I seems impossible for a water based life form to survive much less even to<br>
live and actually grow _and_ reproduce at temperature 60 degrees C,  because<br>
of protein destruction alone.  Yet,  they do even above 100 degrees C.<br>
  Also, remember the high pressures in the deep sea vents.   in the late<br>
1980's I researched pressure to kill bacteria.  I found 30,000 psi starts<br>
killing, but not until 60,000 psi do you get commercially feasible kill.<br>
 Even then, you must quickly pressurize (a cell normally liking atmospheric)<br>
and then quickly de-pressurize (in less than 100 microseconds) to get several<br>
log reduction.   Bacterial spores of _Bacillus_ and _Clostridium_ are the<br>
most resistant.   The extreme thermophil spores can survive 121 degrees C<br>
steam autoclaving for  365 days of exposure (the longest I've seem tested). <br>
<p>
Cold preserves most types of cells (but not for coliform bacteria e.g.,<br>
_E._coli), the colder the better.  Some mold (possibly _Pseudomonas_<br>
bacteria) will grow below 0 degrees C. How is that possible?  How can water<br>
freeze and the cell survive or even grow?  One answer is: It _doesn't_ freeze<br>
inside the cell via "natural" anti-freezes e.g., sugar.  (BTW I don't like<br>
how the word "natural" has been "Deo optimo maximo" in food stores).<br>
<p>
Life is less fragile than even _I_ think it is.  In 1975, I though I was<br>
mighty optimistic.   I've spent my professional life for 20 years researching<br>
microbial control and bacterium, yeast and mold cell injury "natural"<br>
recovery mechanisms.  I then develop methods to "artificially"  (another<br>
evolving word) recover injured cells.  I'm constantly amazed at life's<br>
resiliency.  Based on what I've seen I would not be surprised if human<br>
cryonic suspension works.<br>
<p>
DNA studies make me think the extreme thermophils are one of the first like<br>
forms and were not adaptations of later life forms.  If this is true, cells<br>
were assembled, adapted (evolved) while under extreme environmental pressure.<br>
 This could mean life is abundant in the Universe and in places we don't<br>
expect it to be.<br>
