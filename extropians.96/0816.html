<i>&gt;I'm not an expert on the anonymous forwarding service but I noticed that I </i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't get a message from them until I posted something.  In other words, </i><br>
<i>&gt;each time a message passes through the service, it is probably programmed to </i><br>
<i>&gt;send a message back to that user informing them that anon.penet.fi is </i><br>
<i>&gt;closing down.  So, if you've posted 4 times since the service began its </i><br>
<i>&gt;shutdown, you've probably received 4 messages; if you've posted 10 times </i><br>
<i>&gt;then maybe you've received 10 messages (although hopefully there is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;limit).</i><br>
<p>
Whats worse is that I was on a mailinglist using the penet address and the<br>
mailinglist still tries to mail me the messages. The point that the penet<br>
address is shutdown prevents me from recieving the messages, and instead the<br>
penet address sends me those closing down messages as a replacement for each<br>
real message send by the mailinglist. Not to meantion that the mailinglist I<br>
subscribed to had quite a deal of traffic so I recieve *ALOT* of those<br>
closing down messages everyday. If you couldn't follow what I just said,<br>
forget it it's not that important and I did a pathetic job of explaining it.<br>
