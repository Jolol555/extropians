<i>&gt; Likewise, the more I look into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the matter, the stronger grows my opinion that what we currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; refer to as "smartness" or "intelligence" is a whole cluster of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentally distinct skills that we have yet to disentangle from</i><br>
<i>&gt; one another.</i><br>
<p>
There are all kinds of semantic primitives; visual images, motor skills,<br>
causal linkages, God knows what.  Nothing rules out saying: "Person A<br>
has a better ability to manipulate visual primitives by looking at them<br>
from different angles, but has trouble with motor skills."  "Person B is<br>
better at tracing single causal links but can't formulate long causal<br>
chains."  (A is dyslexic, I am B).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Eliezer, you offer us something you call "a measure of smartness",</i><br>
<i>&gt; but you are not proposing any means of actually *measuring* anything.</i><br>
<p>
The SAT - not IQ tests, just the SAT - measures the ability to trace<br>
single causal links.  I don't know why.  Rubik's Cube could probably<br>
measure the ability to handle visual semantic primitives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, your talk of The Meaning of Life makes me uncomfortable. Life</i><br>
<i>&gt; has many meanings, and I don't think they can all really be reduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a single measure.</i><br>
<p>
1) Life has many meanings?  Name five.<br>
2) Nothing rules out multiple distinct classes of self-justifying goals;<br>
in fact, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I expect that any one member of this bundle will be,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps, measurable someday, but that *value* or *meaning* is</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that emerges only from the synergistic interaction of</i><br>
<i>&gt; many such skills, knowledges, and microvalues and not something</i><br>
<i>&gt; that can be identified with any one subcomponent.</i><br>
<p>
My diatribes on semantic primitives and ethics were more or less<br>
distinct; you appear to have gotten them confused.  Smartness is the<br>
ability to solve some problem; ethics asks what problem we should be<br>
solving.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We don't even have a general benchmark of value for</i><br>
<i>&gt; something as simple as a desktop workstation.</i><br>
<p>
Nonetheless, my PowerCenter 120 beats my old Plus.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Improving performance in</i><br>
<i>&gt; one area of a complex system nearly always involves performance</i><br>
<i>&gt; tradeoffs in some other area.</i><br>
<p>
I *know* that.  I invented Algernon's Law:  "Any major enhancement of<br>
human intelligence is a net evolutionary disadvantage."<br>
