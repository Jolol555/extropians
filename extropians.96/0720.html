        I think this question will vary from individual to individual.<br>
Personally, I believe  that there is no end to the universe.  In fact, I<br>
*hope* that there is no end to the universe.  If there is no end to the<br>
universe, there is always farther to go.  More to strive for.  If it were<br>
discovered that there was indeed an end, then that would be a limit.  The<br>
stereotypical question: 'where do we go from here' would have a brutal<br>
answer: 'nowhere'.  That would definately be the most depressing day for me,<br>
and probably many others as well.<br>
        As for 'conquering' this universe and moving on to the next, again I<br>
hope not.  The word 'conquering' doesn't sit well with me in the first place.<br>
Why conquer?  Discovery is far more important than actually 'taking<br>
something over'; much like an idea is more important than the final product.<br>
Hence, transhumanism and extropianism.  Insight to the future.  The idea of<br>
'ingredi externus' (a Latin term I often use meaning 'go beyond') is more<br>
important than the product ordained.  Without an idea, there can be no creation.<br>
        Libertarianism is basically the 'politic of freedom'.  Man can only<br>
be free if there is no limit to the lengths he can go, ie: if the universe<br>
has no end, there is no limit that can't be nullified.<br>

        applause in the lecture room,<br>
 How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,<br>
 Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,<br>
 In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,<br>
 Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars."<br>
