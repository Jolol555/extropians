As far as I am concerned, this is ludicrous.  I think it is a waste of time<br>
for the government to be involved in discussions regarding the spiritual and<br>
religious ramifications of scientific discoveries.  Is the government going<br>
to create some "spiritual" space policy?  Who cares?  The religious and<br>
spiritual ramifications of scientific discovery should impact neither the<br>
government nor the scientific community.  Wholesale absurdity.  The<br>
government has enough problems on its hands without getting involved in<br>
something stupid and irrelevant like this.<br>
<p>
I hope my tax dollars didn't pay for this.<br>
