In addition to my Global Climate Manipulation &amp; Control thread which I<br>
&lt;bold&gt;REALLY REALLY HOPE&lt;/bold&gt; receives replys this time I was also<br>
considering the thought of the near-term future of warfare, such as say a<br>
decade (no nano, or AI perversion attacks). I watched "Eraser" for the<br>
first time yesterday and I began wondering about the prospects of<br>
railguns. Are they feasible? I remember from reading "Snow Crash" that<br>
they were able to puree a boat with a high-speed railgun. Also for those<br>
of you living on the west coast of the United States, remember the<br>
blackout that occurred twice in seven states and the press never fully<br>
explained the reason or went indepth? The military have already<br>
considered the idea of creating electromagnetic pulse pipebombs to<br>
knockout communications and electricity and experimenting a physically<br>
harmless device on the populous wouldn't be that bad so why not black out<br>
seven states? What about soldiers being equipped with augmented reality<br>
displays to enable them to see in infrared, and nightvision or a combo of<br>
both superimposed on each other for maximum vision? I'm sure developments<br>
such as these will eventually be commercialized and drift down to the<br>
masses. To recap, are railguns physically possible? Would the military<br>
experiment on us like that? and was that 7 state blackout really an EMP<br>
pipebomb? Welcome to the new era in Information Warfare!!<br>
