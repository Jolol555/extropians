Aegis :<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm clarifying a few points, and then I'm off this thread, and </i><br>
possibly off this list.  I cannot take the nastiness of the tone <br>
around here much longer.  It's sad, because I thought I might be <br>
extropian--I guess that isn't the case.<br>
<p>
I don't agree, Kathryn, Extropians I have met so far have been more than<br>
courteous, well informed and very lovely.  When people chide me for being<br>
nonscientific or can't agree with my art- needs-techno-and -techno -needs-art<br>
world view,  i don't see anyone on either side ( i catch shit from the art<br>
community even worse, believe me) as being nasty , just concerned with truth.<br>
And I seek to show them my side... not to press them into it. ANYWAY It is<br>
not a forum for emotional toned conversation, at all. Scientists are used to<br>
the most rigid and demanding public debunking as part of their training.<br>
I understand this , coming from beauty, not facts, an artist  has more of a<br>
"touchy feely" kind of field, and so hardly am I  offended ( unless they call<br>
my mom names or something) but rather choose to feel greatly *complemented*<br>
when others of high intelligence take up a subject and challenge me on it,<br>
even if I think they are wrong, or ill informed, because it forces me to<br>
examine my own beliefs and theories.<br>
   I am starting to see a pattern with you of making a post, then becoming<br>
upset and accusing others of being nasty when your viewpoint is healthily<br>
questioned and the truth of it challenged. I am just commenting impartially. <br>
