As I tried to explain in my Nov. 7 post when you said the same thing, the only <br>
way we can understand The Pauli Exclusion Principle, the reason 2 atoms can't <br>
be at the same place at the same time, is if atoms do NOT have individuality. <br>
It's even broader than Pauli, it's the basses of the entire idea of Exchange <br>
Forces, one of the cornerstones of modern Physics. If atoms are individuals <br>
then you can throw almost all physics done from 1900 to today into the trash <br>
can.<br>
<p>
And it's not just because of Science that trying to develop a theory of <br>
consciousness based on position is a bad idea, there are Philosophical <br>
problems too. Where does consciousness exist? If it's inside my head why <br>
don't I understand what it's like to float in a liquid encased in a dome made <br>
of bone? I assure you I don't know what that's like, and that sure doesn't <br>
seem to me to be where "I" am. Where does "old" exist? Where does "fast" <br>
exist?  Where does the number "11" exist? Where does consciousness exist? <br>
These questions have no answer because they  make no sense.<br>
  <br>
On another matter I just want to say that, I don't know when the Singularity <br>
will happen but one thing I do know, we're one year closer to it. <br>
HAPPY NEW YEAR! <br>
      <br>
