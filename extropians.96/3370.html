A group of transhuman technology advocates hight the Extropians, to<br>
whose mailing list I am subscribed, read an interview with you (in<br>
Fortune magazine) in which you spoke highly of nanotechnology.  This<br>
touched off a minor debate in which numerous individuals spoke of<br>
introducing you to our happy group, but nobody contacted you because the<br>
concept of actually DOING something is apparently foreign to these<br>
people.  I am therefore taking matters into my own hands.<br>
<p>
Judging by your quotes in the nanotechnology article, you are familiar<br>
with the materialist Utopia aspect of nanotechnology, but not with the<br>
far more powerful intelligence enhancement technologies that lead to the<br>
Singularity.<br>
<p>
---Quick Intro To The Singularity---<br>
<p>
1) Computers double in power every eighteen months.<br>
2) Computers double in power every eighteen *subjective* months.<br>
3) Three years after computers match human researchers, computing power<br>
goes to infinity.<br>
<p>
4) The human brain is thought to require 10^17 operations/second.<br>
5) Current computing power is 10^12 ops/second.<br>
6) The Singularity will occur in approximately 2025.<br>
<p>
---End of Quick Intro---<br>
<p>
Since you're interested in the far future, I just thought you should<br>
know that human history ends in less than thirty years.  The scenes<br>
depicted in "The Diamond Age" are really quite unlikely.  Before<br>
nanotechnology was that familiar, the era of merely human intelligences<br>
would be long gone.<br>
<p>
One Web page - say, you actually invented those things, didn't you? - in<br>
which you might be interested is "Staring Into The Singularity" at:<br>
<a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html</a><br>
<p>
This expands the arguments given above, which are actually totally<br>
implausible.  Too optimistic because a dish of bacteria doesn't outweigh<br>
the world in 4 days, and too pessimistic because bacteria can't think.<br>
<p>
The page also provides answers to some "very philosophical questions".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "There's no reason death should happen," he rushes on. "There's no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; decay shouldn't be totally repairable. There's no reason you shouldn't be</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to design exactly the body you want." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Well," I say, "there's no reason I should be unhappy." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "That raises a very philosophical question," he says. He seems exhausted, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps disappointed by my skepticism. He slows down for a second.  "Well,</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the very least the concept of manufacturing goes away." </i><br>
<p>
[As you might put it:]<br>
"Well, then, we could redesign our minds too.  There's no reason why we<br>
should feel pain.  There's no reason why our short-term memories should<br>
only hold seven items.  There's no reason why we shouldn't think<br>
millions of times faster.  You could speed up your neurons, put in some<br>
new ones, and rearrange them any way you wanted to.  If you wanted to<br>
feel happy, you could do that."<br>
<p>
My page supplies a categorical answer to "Why?", as well as "What?",<br>
"How?" and "When?".  Probably not correct answers, as I take pains to<br>
point out, but answers that at least show any lesser answers to be<br>
wrong.<br>
<p>
Up and Out,<br>
