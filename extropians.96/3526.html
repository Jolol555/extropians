<i>&gt; From:          "Max M" &lt;maxmcorp@inet.uni-c.dk&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see why we need AI at all to reach the singularity!!!</i><br>
................<br>
<i>&gt; My idea for reaching the Singularity is then: If we keep building better</i><br>
<i>&gt; tools for humans to use to make better tools to make better tools .... you</i><br>
<i>&gt; know. Recursive stuff. Then we would finally have a software tool where all</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have to input is new ideas and a vague notion about how it is done. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; tool could then do the rest or we could experiment until we had it right.</i><br>
................<br>
<i>&gt; Does this sound like nonsens?</i><br>
<p>
Not at all.  It is, in fact, the direction that things are already<br>
going.  Code generators and high level languages do what you describe<br>
to a limited extent right now.  Modern operating systems handle more<br>
and more of the details of utilising specific hardware so that<br>
applications developers don't have to know all the details of every<br>
printer, video card, communications device, etc.  There is enourmous<br>
room for improvement, yet there is also considerable progress<br>
already.  Each generation of tools helps to create the next. The same<br>
phenomenon is already affecting the development of better hardware as<br>
well.  Better hardware provides the resources that are needed by more<br>
sophisticated software.  More sophisticated EDA software then<br>
contributes to the development of better hardware. Languages, code<br>
generators, EDA and CAD tools, better hardware, better manufacturing<br>
technology.  It all interacts to create better &amp; better computers &amp;<br>
software at an accelerating rate.  The magic moment when technology<br>
begins to contribute to it's own development is not still waiting for<br>
us in the future.  It began years ago with the creation of the first<br>
assemblers and crude debugging tools.  Or maybe it was the creation<br>
of the first electronic test instruments. Or mass production.  Or<br>
maybe it was the invention of the printing press.  Or agriculture. Or<br>
the first primitive human who discovered that he could use a rock as<br>
a tool to create a blade, an even better tool.  Take your pick.  The<br>
point is that technology has been contributing to its own development<br>
for a long time.  I think that the fatal assumption made by<br>
"singularity" proponents is that the present rate of development is<br>
not already feeding itself.  It should be clear that this is not the<br>
case.  After all, a human with a circa 1996 engineering library, a<br>
modern cad system, and a connection to the Internet is a better<br>
designer than an otherwise equivalent human with the tools that were <br>
prevalent in 1976.  Then they created TRS 80's.  Now look at what is <br>
being created.  Our intelligence is not unaided even now.<br>
<p>
Lest someone think that I am arguing that we are not on the verge of<br>
a very significant turning point, I must state that this is not the<br>
case.  I think that singularity proponents are correct in their<br>
assessment that we are approaching a point in history in which things<br>
will change in very profound and fundamental ways.  But the<br>
enthusiasm that this recognition generates can color perceptions and<br>
cause some assumptions to go unquestioned because we really like<br>
their implications.<br>
