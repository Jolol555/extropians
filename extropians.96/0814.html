	Chris Hind is wondering why Christians claim to "seek the truth", when they <br>
really don't.<br>
	Remember, most people are very concerned what others think and say about <br>
them, and they are quite motivated to receive approval from others.  This <br>
desire for approval leads people to do and say that which is fashionable, <br>
regardless of whether they believe in what they do or say.  To call oneself a <br>
seeker of truth is simply a fashionable thing to do; if a Christian claimed <br>
that they weren't a seeker of truth, they would be severely ridiculed, by <br>
other Christians and by non-Christians.  They claim to "seek the truth" simply <br>
to look good, not because they really mean it or even understand what it <br>
really means to seek the truth.  Their blatant dogmatism is evidence that they <br>
don't seek the truth, but it would be very bad for their image to admit that.<br>
	Most people, Christians included, have no understanding of the intense <br>
personal discipline required in seeking the truth, and very few people are <br>
willing to discipline themselves so severely.  To continually question and <br>
doubt one's assumptions, to continually keep oneself open to seeing things <br>
clearly, and to continually refine one's thinking skills are not easy <br>
processes to maintain, and they require an extreme devotion to understanding <br>
how things are.  To accept some nice, cozy belief system is much easier, but <br>
is also much less rewarding.<br>
