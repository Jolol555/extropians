<i>&gt;Creativity is often more Religion than Science, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;what is often called Right-Brain thinking, as opposed to Logical </i><br>
<i>&gt;Left-Brain thinking.</i><br>
<p>
Ahh, now you understand what I'm trying to say. I used religion as a<br>
channel into my raw creativity so now I'm experimenting and toying around<br>
with new methods such as wicca and other nature/gaia-related<br>
ideas/religions such as envisioning objects in nature and then thinking<br>
about how I could take a raw nature form and mold it into whatever living<br>
art form I liked with genengineering and jotting down the ideas. The wicca<br>
situation is tricky because it requires me to attempt holding contradictory<br>
beliefs. Is there a connection between Tourette's and pattern recognition &amp;<br>
perception making someone with the disorder able to bring patterns out of<br>
random objects easier? Because there are quite a few creative people with<br>
Tourettes and it seems to go hand in hand with certain family members who<br>
exhibit subtle versions of the disorder. When I was young I was so good at<br>
this that I could entrance myself and make plants dance side to side in a<br>
pot. I don't remember who it was on this list who said they were able to<br>
naturally exhibit the traits typical of hallucinagenics through training<br>
and concentration bringing on 'mystic' experiences. Unless they just had<br>
high doses of LSD stored in their fat cells and went jogging. :) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When you associate patterns more randomly, your </i><br>
<i>&gt;creativity soars, but your credibility often goes out of check.</i><br>
<p>
Must find a balance. Perhaps we need to find some way to stir up some<br>
philosophical method to generate creativity and inject it into the<br>
extropian principles? Any ideas Natasha?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;evil.  I still wonder how much of this he may have learned directly from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Socrates teachings.</i><br>
<p>
I never thought of him acquiring ideas from socrates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; o  Creative friends do help... as do other sources of Inspiration.</i><br>
<p>
Well, maybe I'll find some when I go to that Extropian dinner on Jan 1st.<br>
