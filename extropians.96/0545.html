Since this concept is generating more on-line conversation than I had<br>
envisaged, it seemed appropriate to respond to some of the points made in<br>
other posts (specifically those by Rich Artym, Peter Voss, Natasha More, and<br>
Dave Sill).<br>
<p>
(In reference to a point Natasha made: I'm posting this to both Extropian<br>
and Transhuman lists, as the topic seems to have spread to both lists. I'll<br>
reply to any further posts on the list from which the posts originate.)<br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; I think 'dynamic individual freedom' sums up my approach to the subject: I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wish to define my own freedoms to suit my own worldview and have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; flexibility to manipulate and alter those freedoms as that worldview changes.</i><br>
<p>
And that about sums it up, really.<br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rich Artym:</i><br>
<i>&gt;The "unlimited" IF that we have been examining here is</i><br>
<i>&gt;entirely dynamic, completely renegociable at the time of each new</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction, not held back by static preconceptions or institutionalized</i><br>
<i>&gt;rules.  That is why we called it "unlimited", because by being dynamic</i><br>
<i>&gt;it knows no a priori bounds.  Needless to say, it's equally correct to</i><br>
<i>&gt;call it Dynamic, because it *is*.</i><br>
<p>
I, too, cannot see huge differences between UIF and DIF, except that the<br>
former emphasises the 'other' whereas the latter emphasises the 'self'. The<br>
discussions I have had on this list which concern UIF have tended to focus<br>
on external coercion, to look how one is treated by the rest of the<br>
universe, rather than look at one's own ability to interact with that<br>
universe in a self-deterministic way. It's a very subtle, and perhaps purely<br>
semantic disctinction, but a very important one.<br>
<p>
For me, transhumanism (and, hence, Extropianism) is about both the<br>
realization of potential and, inspirationally, the transcending of that<br>
initial potential: in essence, being all that one can be and more (no pun<br>
intended). And DIF is a clear expression of that, more so that UIF, because<br>
of DIF's intrinsic references to self-determinism, interaction and flexibility.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rich Artym phrases this thus:</i><br>
<i>&gt;The dynamism is not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;an incidental part of this concept after all --- it is the single most</i><br>
<i>&gt;important one, because it is that which allows UIF/DIF (and &gt;IF of course)</i><br>
<i>&gt;to work within a universe of self-transformation where static schemes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;rendered obsolete at every turn.</i><br>
<p>
Whilst Peter Voss does a superb job of summarizing the Extropian nature of<br>
DIF, which is well worth repeating here:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For me it conjures up:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dynamic - growth, pro-active, ever changing, transformation</i><br>
<i>&gt;Individual - independent thought and action, importance of self</i><br>
<i>&gt;Freedom - more options, (life) expansion, individual rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would add my (extropian) spin of:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Intelligent - using reason, advanced technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;Responsible - goal-directed, (libertarian) self-responsibility</i><br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Natasha More:</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd rather start fresh and be sure from the beginning that</i><br>
<i>&gt;when I speak of my unlimited freedoms...</i><br>
<p>
I don't believe one can talk of unlimited freedoms, only self-limited<br>
freedoms, and DIF incorporates that idea of flexible self-limitation.<br>
<p>
Natasha More:<br>
<i>&gt;I seek a phrase that sees freedom as more objective...</i><br>
<p>
Any objective definition of freedom (by which I mean one upon which all can<br>
agree) must allow for the subjective realization of that freedom: that is,<br>
it must express freedom as a concept of sufficient flexibility to assimilate<br>
and implement the personal desires of all its proponents, as individuals.<br>
The 'dynamism' of DIF allows for this, in my opinion: it encompasses the<br>
flexibility of self-determination and self-realization required for a<br>
generally acceptable definition of freedom.<br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Dave Sill:</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think it's generally understood that "unlimited" means "not </i><br>
<i>&gt;externally limited". Unlimited doesn't mean uncontrollable. And if </i><br>
<i>&gt;you weren't free to give up some of your freedom, your freedom would </i><br>
<i>&gt;be limited.</i><br>
<p>
Again, this comes down to my desire to emphasise the 'self', and a belief<br>
that 'unlimited' is really a misleading phrasing of 'self-limited'. Rich<br>
Artym says something similar in one his posts:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;by concentrating on the dynamism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we may be able to avoid the misinterpretations of "unlimited" that those</i><br>
<i>&gt;not too well acquainted with UIF have occasionally made.</i><br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Richard Artym:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Furthermore, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is a pearl beyond price, by pointing out the DYNAMISM of this freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it becomes inescapable that limits to individual freedom cannot be set in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a priori manner through jurisdictional restraint.</i><br>
<p>
In a way yes. Although I think it would be more accurate to say that by<br>
pointing out the dynamism of this freedom it becomes inescapable that limits<br>
to individual freedom can be set through jurisdictional restraint only for<br>
those individuals who choose to respect that jurisdictional restraint. And<br>
further, the dynamism of those individuals means they remain free to change<br>
their minds and cease to respect the restraint. Perhaps this is another<br>
subtle difference from UIF: DIF doesn't place the same opprobrium on those<br>
who choose to allow others to restrict their freedom, because the dynamism<br>
overtly recognizes that that acceptance is transient, and hence DIF is never<br>
abbrogated.<br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Natasha More:<br>
<i>&gt;Maximum, I do like.  I will have to give it careful thought and see if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;restrict one's freedoms.  I'm not sure that it does.</i><br>
<p>
I don't believe 'maximum' overtly limits one's freedoms. But I believe it<br>
does so implicity, for similar reasons to 'unlimited':<br>
<p>
(1) it implies some level of opprobrium attaching to those who for some<br>
reason make a changeable decision to apply limits derived from their<br>
interactions with others,<br>
<p>
(2) it does not actively convey the element of self-determinism which seems<br>
to me to underpin not only freedom but the whole transhuman ethos.<br>
<p>
          ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
I hope the above discussion gives some idea of my reason for selecting DIF<br>
as my 'chosen freedom '. I'd be extremenly interested to hear other views on<br>
this interpretation.<br>
