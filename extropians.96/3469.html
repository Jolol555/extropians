As stated previously, this system relies on conservation of momentum.<br>
Here's a good analogy: conservation of momentum is what prevents solid<br>
rings from forming around planets. All rings are congregations of small<br>
objects, from ion size up to a few meters in dia. A solid ring would be<br>
unstable because at one point or another, perturbations will shift it so<br>
that its center of geometry separates from its center of angular<br>
velocity, causing the same sort of phenomena as occurs within this<br>
mechanism. THe thrust generated would cause it to get further out of<br>
whack, creating even more thrust, until it eventually hits the planet.<br>
This scenaario is what led to the mathematical proof for Keplers Law.<br>
