I've been waiting for the Right Moment to pipe up on this thread.  That<br>
just proves my low IQ of course.  The truth is I'll never be prepared<br>
to make a well-thought-out essay on this topic that gives proper credit<br>
to similar points that have been made all the way back to Robin's original<br>
post and also up to the minute.  Life in the asymptotic lane doesn't work<br>
that way.  So I apologize in advance for repeating others' thoughts.<br>
<p>
All this discussion of *what* the Great Filter might be, when I think<br>
the question *whether* there is good reason to think that there is a great<br>
filter, deserves more attention.  In other words, how sure are we that we<br>
are *not* looking at alien civilizations?  (Yes, Robin addressed that<br>
from the beginning, but with his emphasis on organized *looking* matter<br>
I think he missed the important point (to follow).)<br>
<p>
But then the thread evolved to the point of sentience, and more and more<br>
posts on "low profile" and berserkers started to appear.  One funny post<br>
started, "Until now I've been lurking..."  (Yes!  Good point!  Good example!<br>
Think of the universe as a *discussion group*.  Think about *kill files*.<br>
But I'm running ahead of myself (&amp; I'll get to that, too).)  Let me drag<br>
out the slogan of Cryptocosmology (with apologies to Clarke,<br>
(but after all he invented the communications satellite)):<br>
<p>
  "Sufficiently advanced communication is indistinguishable from noise."<br>
<p>
Again I apologize as I explain the joke fully because it's the basis of<br>
what I want to say: 1) Arthur C. Clarke's Law is that "Any sufficiently<br>
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 2) Cryptograpy,<br>
steganography (hiding data within other data) and data compression produce<br>
signals that look as much as possible like random numbers.  Cryptography and<br>
steganography because they are trying to reveal as little as possible,<br>
data compression because any non-noiselike character of a signal represents<br>
redundancy, a waste of bandwidth.  The joke for crypto and compression<br>
people is that here is a basic truism in both fields that happens to<br>
have a natural phrasing just like Clarke's law.  The joke for extropians<br>
is that Clarke is wrong (or was, if he's since wised up): information is<br>
the ultimate technology, and ultimate information looks like...nothing.<br>
Not flashy magic, just nothing.  It works hard to look like nothing.<br>
<p>
Which is what we see when we look at the skies.  Or at the dirt at our feet,<br>
or at the Sun, or each other, for that matter.  Nothing...unnatural.<br>
Nothing...unexpected.  Nothing...out of the ordinary.<br>
<p>
Of course not, you idiots!  (Joking, *joking* of course!  (I even have to<br>
tell these idiots that I don't think they're idiots!)  You are all very<br>
SMART idiots!)  My point is something like, "That's what they WANT you to<br>
belive," except for two things: the first is that this needs to be<br>
distinguished from paranoia, and the second is that the beliefs of We<br>
primitive idiots aren't what the hypothesized They are worried about.<br>
<p>
Now, to climb to full height at my pulpit, I need to step on the shoulder<br>
of another giant, Gregory Bateson, who quipped deeply:<br>
<p>
  "A bit is a difference that makes a difference."<br>
<p>
We can make a rough (okay very rough) theorem from this:<br>
<p>
   A bit is a difference that makes a difference.<br>
   Only differences make a difference.<br>
   Things that don't make a difference don't matter.<br>
   --&gt; Bits are all that matters.<br>
   (or, Everything that matters, is bits.)<br>
<p>
You might think I mean that we can encode all our favorite books, movies<br>
and shapes into a big VR machine, and that would be "all that really<br>
matters."   But I'm no "chop off my body and its feelings and material<br>
attachments and let me be pure intellect" extropian.  It's more.<br>
I mean everything everybody cares about, everything anyone could care about,<br>
already *is* information.  All of the universe as we know it or imagine it,<br>
is information.<br>
<p>
A better approximation would be that all the characteristics of<br>
things we know about can be seen as information encoded on a<br>
substrate of particles and waves.  The features we know about are only<br>
a barest scratch, the encoding seems extremely inefficient.  But this isn't<br>
quite radical enough.  The distribution of matter in the universe, the<br>
types of particles we see, their characteristics and relative populations,<br>
and the laws by which they interact, as well as anything we know about<br>
initial conditions and current chaotic broken-symmetric outcomes, in other<br>
words all the characteristics of the supposed "substrate"--these are<br>
all information, too.<br>
<p>
And thinking of only the stuff we pay attention to, as the real information,<br>
encoded inefficiently against a background of noise, is wrong, too.  Even if<br>
it is noise, it's still information.<br>
<p>
The right way of looking at it is this: all there is is information, and<br>
what we know about, even all we've guessed about (for instance, imagining<br>
molecules in blades of alien grass on alien planets scattered all over the<br>
universe), is a tiny droplet in a sea--but a completely flat, grey sea,<br>
because I'm talking about the completely unknown that is the vast majority<br>
of the information that's around us (and this is no vague or unscientific<br>
statement, it's just meant as a plain observation of the ratio of known<br>
to unknown bits).<br>
<p>
This is the right place to start to look at the future of technology.<br>
Because the job is to encode the bits that matter to us, more efficiently.<br>
To access our favorite bits more easily.  To replicate our bits more<br>
safely.  Only as soon as you say "more efficiently," then if I've made my<br>
point so far, you see that this only means, to colonize that sea.<br>
<p>
It's the sea of information that any intelligence that evolves to something<br>
like this point will want to colonize.  Not good old 3D space.  Not<br>
particularly *not* 3-space either, the point is just that it's the universe<br>
as information, not volume or mass per se, that matters.<br>
<p>
So anyway, yes, we will try to dump as much of what matters to us as<br>
possible into nanocomputers the size of Jupiter.  And I hope that includes<br>
all the plants and animals and microbes of the surface and depths of the<br>
earth, sea and sky, as well as lots of the inanimate features of nature, and<br>
the spilled ice cream cones and landfills, too.  But whatever happens, it's<br>
*information* that's moving and, as evolution continues, more and more it's<br>
information that knows itself as, and treats itself as information.<br>
<p>
That's enough to return to my point: that we don't know we're not looking<br>
at "alien" civilizations.  We don't know that the whole universe isn't<br>
colonized.  Life evolves to become efficiently-encoded information,<br>
which looks like sunlight and dirt.  I think these are the most natural<br>
developments to expect.  The default scenario.  I would expect<br>
a colonized universe to look exactly like a barren one.  So what was the<br>
Fermi "paradox" again?<br>
<p>
Speculation about "What prevented all the other civilizations from<br>
getting farther than this?" seems...off base.  This is what distinguishes<br>
cryptocosmology from paranoia.  I'm not saying I know They're out there<br>
--or here--hiding or trying to fool us.  But plainly if they were there we<br>
wouldn't know it.  So if someone raises the question of "Why aren't They<br>
there," one must ask, "Says who?"  Speculation on a false premise can be<br>
a waste of time.  Any speculation about Them *approaches* paranoia, and<br>
that's fun as well as risking nonsense, but let's be as intelligent as we<br>
can about it, if only because being closer to plausibility is *more* fun.<br>
<p>
I think a crypto-informed version of this discussion can be worthwhile,<br>
and I wanted to mention a couple of starter ideas:<br>
<p>
1) Berserkers, seen as hulking tank-robots shooting their way across<br>
planet surfaces, ain't it.  Even Death Stars, near-light-speed meteor<br>
showers, or galactic-scale Electro Magnetic Pulses are too 3-space-centric.<br>
Don't think so much about 3-space territory.  Think more of interpenetrating<br>
infections, computer viruses in the kernel level of physics, or as someone<br>
pointed out (referring back to Vinge) "applied theology".<br>
<p>
2) When I say "dirt" and "here," I mean it.  If they've colonized the<br>
universe, they're here.  If you don't see them, that's because--go back<br>
and reread this post you idiot!  At most, our civilization, life as we<br>
know it, is the faintest ripple, the merest whisp of a breeze, on what's<br>
going on right in our laps.  We are an insignificant perturbation not yet<br>
worthy of scratching, information-theory-wise.<br>
<p>
If that's so,<br>
  a) we may be some minor program intended by someone, as planet Earth was<br>
     a computer to figure out the Question to the Great Answer<br>
     (42) in the Hitchhikers guide.  Or a "zoo" or "ALife experiment."<br>
<p>
  b) Or, we may be (the consequences of) a bug,<br>
<p>
  c) or, a manefestation of compounded errors in a calculation, within<br>
     the allowed bounds,<br>
<p>
  d) or, more likely from a crypto and strategy point of view, something<br>
     that no one can afford to stop without giving away too much,<br>
<p>
  e) or, a natural, if infrequent, occurrance that is best exploited by<br>
     letting it be.<br>
<p>
3) The best argument against life-as-we-see-it being already colonized,<br>
is that light from stars seems to stream off into space where it mostly<br>
just drifts free and unintercepted.  This doesn't seem like efficient<br>
communication or computing to me.  Maybe it's a handy form of storage.<br>
Or perhaps it's the basic form of self-propogation.  It could be a true<br>
waste that's just cryptostrategically necessary.<br>
<p>
4) Civilizations' (to use a too-anthropomorphic term for sufficiently-<br>
evolved intelligence) first danger isn't from alien civilizations, but from<br>
within themselves.  We have weapons and crypto now, to guard against each<br>
other.  Already one of the great Extropian horror scenarios is the<br>
explosive Grab For Territory, where proprietary grey goos squirt out into<br>
space at near-light-speeds in all directions from Earth, trying to claim<br>
volume and mass.  I think we should frame one of those which-comes-first<br>
questions: all technology looks like Dirt, or the Grab For Territory?  I<br>
guess Dirt first (has the term Brown Goo been taken?), in which case what<br>
form the Grab might take becomes more interesting.  (I promised to get back<br>
to the idea of "running ahead of myself."  Huh huh.)<br>
<p>
5) If you still think this line of thought is paranoid, I recommend getting<br>
familiar with cryptography.  Cryptography is a quite friendly, almost<br>
serene fraternity of smart people who think of incredibly obscure threats<br>
because that's necessary in practice, and who imagine ways to do things<br>
that seem impossible (communicating in secret in the open just being the<br>
basic first step) as a matter of course.  What I mean is, crypto is exactly<br>
like paranoia, even more so, yet totally matter-of-fact, practical, open<br>
and sane.  It's really just people looking at the kinds of threats and<br>
promises that exist in a world of information.<br>
<p>
6) To say I've simplified doesn't start to say it.  Maybe the worst is<br>
my ignoring the difference between information storage and processing.<br>
I think the same ideas apply to both, although the field of encrypted<br>
processing is only starting and sometimes doesn't look very promising.<br>
