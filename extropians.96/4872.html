Several people where I work have Pilots, and I have been thinking of<br>
getting one.  I have wanted a PDA for years but couldn't bring myself<br>
to spend the money.<br>
<p>
The pilots are quite compact and if you wear shirts with pockets should<br>
be easy to carry.  However I don't think they are robust enough to be<br>
carried in a pants pocket, particularly not a seat pocket.  I see that<br>
they sell a belt clip case, for that "Revenge of the Nerds" look.<br>
<p>
A couple of people have complained about losing data through various<br>
mishaps.  One guy sat in a position where two buttons were pressed and<br>
somehow this drained the battery.  Overall though they seem happy with<br>
the devices.  They are certainly easier to carry than a Newton.<br>
<p>
The input is done using Graffiti, a stylized pen gesture system, or by<br>
poking at an on-screen keyboard.  The main unique feature is that it comes<br>
with a cradle that attaches to your computer.  You plug in the Pilot and<br>
it hot-syncs its data with what you have on your disk.  This makes the<br>
accidental erasure less of an issue.<br>
<p>
The home page is <a href="http://www.usr.com/palm">http://www.usr.com/palm</a>.  I'm going to try downloading<br>
the demo software and see how it looks.<br>
