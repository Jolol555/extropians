<i>&gt;&gt;If strong nanotechnology is possible, then economy as we know it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be completely different (an information-based economy might work in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;moderate cases, but if rapidly self-augmenting SI becomes possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;even that fails). </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think folks are too stuck on the notion that changes must be</i><br>
<i>&gt;incomprehensible - you don't know what you can or can't understand</i><br>
<i>&gt;until you try.  And you haven't really tried until you've used the</i><br>
<i>&gt;best intellectual tools available.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
        In this case, *both* of you are correct.  When the creation of<br>
nanotechnology becomes manifest, there will certainly be a nearly<br>
instantaneous turnabout in the current economy.  Initially.  Ones who are<br>
equipped with nanites will gain much recognition as 'cyborgs' and<br>
'heretics'.  Mothers will be bending down to their children, pointing and<br>
whispering at the ones with the enhancements.  Initially.<br>
<p>
        Eventually, however, nanotechnology will become commonplace and<br>
tolerated around the world.  People will no longer know the difference<br>
between an enhanced human and an unenhanced one.  It just takes a little bit<br>
of time for people to get used to the notion of 'bettering'.  Even those who<br>
do not agree with nanotechnology will have to accept it...they'll have no<br>
choice.  One of the most prominent trends in nature is 'adaptation through<br>
change'.  I think mankind will follow this trend whether or not it is<br>
entirely accepted.<br>
