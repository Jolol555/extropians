I am inclined to agree with you. Certainly 99.9% or so of the good ideas<br>
and values in my head originated with someone else, and I'm inclined to<br>
identify a large part of my "self" with these ideas and values that were<br>
cooked up by someone else and transmitted into my culture and thence into<br>
me. I judge these ideas and values, and sort them out myself, as an<br>
individual, but I would never be able to cook them all up from scratch.<br>
Without them, I'd be just another shuffling mammal.<br>
<p>
But libertarian political theory is much too concrete to depend on these<br>
abstract concerns about the boundaries of the self. Even a radical altruist<br>
would have to admit that there's nothing compassionate about robbing Peter<br>
to pay Paul. Libertarian political theory revolves around issues of the<br>
plurality of values, the institution of property, and the ethics of the use<br>
of force and fraud. Giving alms may be a moral mandate, contra Rand,<br>
without necessarily making it morally permissible to *force* the giving of<br>
alms.<br>
<p>
I don't know of any altruist/collectivist arguments that solidly<br>
demonstrate that it's okay for a person A to stick a gun to the head of<br>
person B and make person B do something (or refrain from doing something)<br>
that person B doesn't want to do (or refrain from doing). And ultimately,<br>
these are the kinds of situations that libertarians are concerned with<br>
identifying and preventing.<br>
