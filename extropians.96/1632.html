<p>
Fine, sounds like something worth a try, sometimes a big corporation becomes <br>
ossified and is driven to extinction by a small fierce competitor. Maybe your <br>
co-op could do that, maybe not, the market will let you know. <br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;pay.</i><br>
<p>
                <br>
Politicians love business taxes because they are invisible to most consumers, <br>
they just lead to higher prices for everything. Corporations are robbed twice <br>
by government thugs, once as a business tax and then any profit that goes to <br>
shareholders is taxed again, both as dividends and capital gains.<br>

<p>
The only hope these people have is to live on charity until they can learn a <br>
marketable skill. If most people do not feel charitable toward them then they <br>
are in deep trouble, but government can't help. If I am unwilling to <br>
voluntarily give money to these people why would I vote for a politician who<br>
would force me to do it through taxes?<br>

                   <br>
<p>
I really don't understand it, whenever somebody wants to show how evil <br>
corporations are, they always come up with a long list of rotten things that <br>
governments do. Granted, few companies actively opposed these monstrous  <br>
regimes, but that's not quite the same thing as instigating it, and anyway  <br>
can you really blame them for not playing the hero, in most cases it would be <br>
economic if not real suicide.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Shell has the government in its pocket</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
It would really be great if that was true, then justice could be treated like <br>
a commodity, surely the best way to maximize it, but unfortunately it is not <br>
true .<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;this was a fault of the bureaucracy and elite control rather                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;than the concept of equality.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Equality is a second rate sort of virtue, you can't have too much justice or <br>
truth or beauty or intelligence or kindness, but you can have too much  <br>
equality.          <br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Because Altruism isn an extropian virtue we shouldn practice                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;it? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Good heavens NO!!! I don't care for it myself but I definitely think altruism <br>
would be just perfect for you, and for everybody else for that matter. I have  <br>
often said Anarchy is only the second best system, undoubtedly the best is  <br>
one where everybody just does what I want them to.<br>

<i>                &gt;If humanity is truly going to ascend and take  our place in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the universe, a then we need to cultivate a sense of respect                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and a little bit of compassion for each other   </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
True. I confess I was being a little glib before, but only a little. The <br>
truth is I engage in compassion myself, but I do so for selfish reasons, <br>
seeing somebody in pain makes me unhappy and if I am the cause of that pain <br>
then I'm even more unhappy.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;the 358 people that own 45% of the worlds wealth. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
If I own a steel mill worth a billion dollars, that does not take money from <br>
poor people, just the reverse, it produces a product that people want and <br>
jobs that people need. I will be able to keep my steel mill only as long as I <br>
can run it as well or better than anyone else.  The day somebody finds a way <br>
to operate a mill significantly better than I do is the day I go broke,  <br>
unless I learn real fast and copy his technique. Having a public mob run the <br>
mill will produce little wealth for anyone. <br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;what I mean is that the markets that most companies aim to                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;are the affluent. Not a whole  lot of demand for electric                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;toothbrushes outside the Western World.                                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then it is in a corporation's best interest to expand its market and make as  <br>
many people affluent as possible.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Governments acting in business interests. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then dump the Government not the business. We can live just fine without <br>
Government but we'd all starve to death without business.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Any elite should look ack at the rest of the people and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;aim to educate and improve the rest with their gifts, not                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;hoard information and  power. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Yes, I think the rulers of governments should do that, but it doesn't matter <br>
a bit what you or I think, our masters will do what they want to do. The <br>
reason the free market sometimes looks  bad in debates like this is that <br>
people are comparing the market as it actually is, warts and all, with a <br>
mythical government lead by a man who always knows exactly what the right  <br>
thing to do is, always has the moral courage to do it, and can convince those <br>
less wonderful than he is that it is indeed the correct path to take. A man <br>
like that never existed and never will, yet people keep thinking if we  can <br>
just elect the right man everything will be fine.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;They  [corporations] take all of some peoples time and                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;don`t give enough money to feed them.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
It doesn't matter how much it takes to feed you, it doesn't  matter how big <br>
your family is, if your services are only worth 75 cents an hour to me then <br>
that's all I would pay for them, unless I was giving charity. Don't <br>
misunderstand, that might be  exactly what I decide to do, but I don't want <br>
to  be forced and it shouldn't be confused for a salary.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I think public communication should be open to the public.                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Sort of like Ralph Naders proposed  Audience Network. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
If people think what is on this network is valuable then people will watch it, <br>
even pay for it. If people think it is worthless then I see no reason it <br>
should be subsidized, that would just result in a huge network that nobody <br>
watches, or should watch because it's junk.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;If we`re  lucky, the internet will alleviate this, but from                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;what I see, nope, simply because it costs a lot to get on. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Costs a lot? AOL charges 10$ a month and you can communicate with the world, <br>
if anyone wants to listen.  The real reason that  people aren't demanding to  <br>
read  Mr. Joe Average's home page is the same reason public access television  <br>
is so dull, Mr. Joe Average has nothing worthwhile to say. You may not be  <br>
average but superior, if so then people will read your Web page, and nobody  <br>
can tell how much money you have only how much talent you have.<br>
<p>
