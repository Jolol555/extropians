<i>&gt;                &gt;I know how my computer works, but it still beats me at</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;arithmetic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nobody understands how a computer works, if we did we wouldn't need them for </i><br>
<i>&gt;arithmetic.</i><br>
<p>
Wait a minute:<br>
<p>
1) I *do* understand, in intimate detail, how a computer produces arithmetic<br>
results on the lowest level.  If we didn't, we wouldn't be able to build them.  <br>
<p>
2) A computer is fast at computation, but doesn't have understanding of the<br>
significance or relevance of the computations it performs.<br>
<p>
3) Understanding and practical capability are very different creatures.<br>
Studying art does not make one a great artist.  Nor does having carnal<br>
knowledge of arithmetic make you lightning fast at computation.<br>
<p>
A Pentium processor can add two numbers faster than it takes an electrical<br>
signal to travel between two neurons.  This is a limitation in our hardware,<br>
not in our understanding.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;the things  [Quantum Computers] are SO damned useful and</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;there's no theoretical reason why it shouldn't work. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I agree that nobody has found a show stopper yet, but there's still a lot we </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't know about Quantum decoherence, error correction and how to program in </i><br>
<i>&gt;Quantum logic. At the current rate of progress I think in 5 years, maybe less, </i><br>
<i>&gt;we'll know for sure if it's possible or not, after that it would just be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;(very difficult) engineering project and the Universe will never be the same. </i><br>
<i>&gt;It would make Drexler's Nanotechnology look like the stone age, but I would </i><br>
<i>&gt;still say there is a 40% chance that such a machine is impossible. Ask me  </i><br>
<i>&gt;again in 5 years.</i><br>
<p>
I thought I read (in Scientific American?) that someone came up with an<br>
error correction protocol for quantum computing.  From what I've been<br>
reading, I would give a very high probability to the possibility of quantum<br>
computing.  From what I've heard, they are expecting the first elementary<br>
quantum computing structures within 5 years in the laboratory.  Practical<br>
application and production: who knows?<br>
