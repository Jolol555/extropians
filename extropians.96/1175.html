If you understand how centralized authority is within the FBI you would<br>
understand how tricking the entire population is fully within the<br>
capability of the FBI, given the population's pathetic faith in<br>
authorities!  When the first talk of a missle began to circulate right<br>
after the crash a high official in the FBI, I cannot recall his name now,<br>
announced that anyone within the Federal Government who thinks a missle<br>
was involved needs his head examined.  This was said with no reference to<br>
evidence of any kind....just "We're the authorities, believe us!  Stop the<br>
missle talk!"<br>
<p>
Apparently, you are unaware of the FBI's long history of deceit.  There<br>
are many possible reasons the FBI might want to cover-up though all are<br>
speculative at this time.  The US govt distributed stinger missles to<br>
Islamic terrorists, the US govt may not want to give terrorists a<br>
publicity victory, the US govt may be in bed with the airlines, the US<br>
govt may want to prevent a friendly fire scandal, etc.  You may remember<br>
the shameful conduct of the FBI hack "scientist" at the OJ trial regarding<br>
the preservative in OJ blood sample being found at the murder site.  You<br>
may remember Mr. Whitehurst who claims fake findings are routine at the<br>
FBI lab.....<br>
<p>
Dare I say you are living in a "goodie two-shoes" dream?<br>
