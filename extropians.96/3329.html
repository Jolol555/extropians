<i>&gt;The widespread use of computer networks will make it much easier to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-employed and contract one's services and talents out to those who offer </i><br>
<i>&gt;an agreeable trade, much like a free lance artist does.  It will become less </i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary to have a "steady job", where one trades with the same person day </i><br>
<i>&gt;after day, and it will become easier and more secure for someone to have </i><br>
<i>&gt;several clients that they work for and multiple streams of income, so they are </i><br>
<i>&gt;not dependent on any single source of income.</i><br>
<p>
I both agree and disagree.  In some industries (like software engineering)<br>
it already is easier to work for multiple clients at the same time.  I am<br>
generally working for about three different clients at any given time.  And<br>
this method almost always gives more flexibility and a lot more money than a<br>
static "9-to-5" type job.  *However*, there are a lot of negatives that go<br>
along with this as well.  The stress levels are generally much higher<br>
because you have many more obligations than a "normal" job.  Also, you don't<br>
get that "warm-fuzzy" secure feeling of always knowing what you will be<br>
doing 6 months from now.  Even though I can objectively say that I have no<br>
difficulties getting work (their has been an ongoing computer professional<br>
deficit in Silicon Valley), and have never had a situation where I had to<br>
worry about finding a job, it isn't quite the same as knowing exactly where<br>
you will be working and what you'll be doing in the future.<br>
<p>
To be honest, I enjoy the dynamic nature of this situation, but I know a lot<br>
of computer types who have gotten really burnt out in this type of work<br>
environment.  There is still something to be said for a steady job, such as<br>
the ability to spend more time with your family.  TANSTAAFL!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If one is interested in completing a very large and complex project, such as </i><br>
<i>&gt;building and maintaining hydroponic greenhouses, then one will want to </i><br>
<i>&gt;organize teams of people to work on this project.  One could first hire a team </i><br>
<i>&gt;of engineers to plan the project and organize it into sub-projects.  Then one </i><br>
<i>&gt;could hire teams and individuals to complete the various sub-projects until </i><br>
<i>&gt;the greenhouses are built and food is being grown in them.  Then one would </i><br>
<i>&gt;receive requests for food and hire people to transport the food to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriate places.  This is not fundamentally any different than what has </i><br>
<i>&gt;been done for thousands of years now.  People have been organizing companies </i><br>
<i>&gt;and groups to complete projects for quite a long time.  Now it's becoming a </i><br>
<i>&gt;lot easier for the average person to do, because computer networks are helping </i><br>
<i>&gt;to lower the costs of organizing a business.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  The Internet has been an enormous help in forming project teams.  I<br>
have a not too small list of developers and programmers that I call or email<br>
whenever I have a large project.  More and more software work is being done<br>
this way.  Most of the software people I know do freelance work for various<br>
projects.  I am working on a $1,000,000 project now where the 25-man<br>
development team is made up entirely of freelancers from around the country.<br>
Meetings and discussions take place largely via a mailing list on the<br>
Internet.  There is usually one or two consultants or freelancers who "run"<br>
the whole project.<br>
<p>
In fact, if you are strictly interested in making money, this is the way to<br>
go.  Sure, you don't have job security, but the pay is great.  Many<br>
independant developers I know have spouses who work steady jobs.  This way,<br>
they have a guaranteed minimum income and usually medical benefits.  But<br>
when you consider that the average freelance developer makes between<br>
$100-500k per year, this is extremely attractive, especially to the younger<br>
age brackets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I predict that as computer networks become more widespread and their use </i><br>
<i>&gt;becomes commonplace, a very large percentage of people will be taking </i><br>
<i>&gt;advantage of this technology to make their economic lives extremely flexible, </i><br>
<i>&gt;dynamic and lucrative.  I predict that it will become increasingly less common </i><br>
<i>&gt;for someone to have a "steady job".  That concept seems radical now, because </i><br>
<i>&gt;there aren't so many secure alternatives for employment than working for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;same person day after day.  However, I believe this will change within a few </i><br>
<i>&gt;years, and it will seem foolish and dangerous to have only one major client </i><br>
<i>&gt;that one is dependent on for income.</i><br>
<p>
In some industries, "steady job" is already meaningless.  Better get used to<br>
it.  Actually, I think the "many client" type of environment separates the<br>
wheat from the chaff much better, ability-wise, than the "steady job"<br>
environment.  I think the "many client" environment will cause a wider<br>
separation between the living standards of the competent and incompetent in<br>
a given skill category, not at all a bad thing, IMO.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe that people will become much more "project oriented" than they are </i><br>
<i>&gt;today.  I think people will look at employment more in terms of working on a </i><br>
<i>&gt;particular project than they do now.  People will hire other people to </i><br>
<i>&gt;complete particular projects or tasks, and when the project is done or the </i><br>
<i>&gt;task is completed, they will each go their own way.  As a project manager, you </i><br>
<i>&gt;may find someone who consistently does excellent work, and you may hire them </i><br>
<i>&gt;regularly to work on various projects, and this will probably be common.  But </i><br>
<i>&gt;that same person will likely have many other clients that they work for as </i><br>
<i>&gt;well.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe that in the future, one's financial situation will more accurately </i><br>
<i>&gt;reflect the quality of work one does and thus be more fair.  Good workers will </i><br>
<i>&gt;develop a good reputation, and there will be a high-paying demand for them, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and they will generally only accept the highest-paying offers for their work.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Those who don't prove themselves to be such good workers will not receive such </i><br>
<i>&gt;high-paying offers for their work.  Of course, they could always hire someone </i><br>
<i>&gt;to teach them how to improve their skills and become a more excellent worker, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and thus improve their financial situation.  </i><br>
<p>
This is exactly the way it currently works in the independant software<br>
development industry.  You can only screw up so many times, and then no one<br>
will hire you.<br>
<p>
And incidentally, the majority of independant developers are self-taught.<br>
If you want to increase your skills, you take it upon yourself to learn more<br>
skills.  This is the way it works.  No one else is responsible for your<br>
welfare except *you*.  I learned a majority of the skills I have by studying<br>
a particular subject I wanted to learn, and then finding a short-term<br>
mediocre job that required those skills.  This way I was able to get the<br>
practical experience, but not at the expense of someone who was paying good<br>
money.  I would then go on to take on the good paying jobs after validating<br>
my newly learned skill.  A lot of people learn this way.  (Lesson here: You<br>
get what you pay for!)  You don't have to pay money to learn a valuable new<br>
skill.  Usually it only involves time, some books, and a short-term pay cut.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Considering human history, it seems that people's economic lives have become </i><br>
<i>&gt;increasingly dynamic and are continuing to become even more flexible.  At one </i><br>
<i>&gt;time, most people were pretty much confined to living in the same village, </i><br>
<i>&gt;doing the same tasks, all their lives.  As we've progressed and developed </i><br>
<i>&gt;large cities, it has become much easier for people to relocate and to change </i><br>
<i>&gt;employers.  Our lives have become much more flexible and filled with more </i><br>
<i>&gt;options.  I believe that the widespread use of computer networks will create </i><br>
<i>&gt;even greater flexibility in people's lives and allow people many more options </i><br>
<i>&gt;for organizing their lives, including greater flexibility of who they work </i><br>
<i>&gt;for.  Technology is providing people the tools they need to take care of </i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves better and manage their own lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Flexibility and options are good, but there is a price.  Large scale<br>
networks are a key component of implementing this flexibility, but I think<br>
it has limits to certain professions and industries.  This would not<br>
generally help a grocery clerk get ahead.  Mostly just skilled professionals.<br>
