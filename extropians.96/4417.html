One thing i am consistantly astounded at is the apologetic tone many<br>
intelligent, intellectual  people take when they admit" to having these<br>
"animal' urges. I understand that the reproductive part of sex is not going<br>
to be an issue as we evolve through other means, yet I am surprised that it<br>
seems the more techno- evloved most men are, and advanced intellectually,<br>
often the more neanderthal  and outdated the belief systems about sex... <br>
Curious indeed....<br>
Good thing we haven't deemed being physically fit an animal instinct, or<br>
playfulness, or we'd all be trying to illimate those attributes too! <br>
<p>
I am glad to see rational and ethical/positive thinking (the latest post by<br>
Will) about the topic. I am sick of hearing how bad sex is, from both<br>
religious and intellectually superior people. <br>
I am pretty optimistic that sex will evolve and enhance in the same way that<br>
art, music, writing, relationships, comforts and commerce will...<br>
It is in its own way a fun way to explore the universe ; ).<br>
Hopefully with the nano scenario of more leisure time, we will need top spend<br>
even less time on basic genetic survival and  instinctual grubbing.<br>
Transhumans will have time for much learning and pleasure...<br>
PS There IS a link between good sex and high intelligence, not a function of<br>
animal lowliness, which produces bad sex, IMEAAW.<br>
