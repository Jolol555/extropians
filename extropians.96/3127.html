Since the first self-replicating systems emerged on this planet, more and more <br>
of the matter and energy on the earth has been converted into living, <br>
self-replicating systems.  Life has been spreading itself further and further, <br>
incorporating more and more matter and energy into itself.  Life has continued <br>
in its steady process of becoming increasingly more complex and intelligent, <br>
by continually altering itself and casting off the alterations which are not <br>
able to maintain themselves in their environments of other living systems.  As <br>
new, complex systems develop, older systems which once flourished become less <br>
able to maintain themselves in their environment of more advanced and robust <br>
systems, and the inferior systems eventually become incapable of maintaining <br>
themselves in their environment, and they are automatically discontinued.<br>
<p>
Currently, there are many intelligent systems in life which are developing <br>
themselves and transforming themselves into new forms.  These intelligent <br>
systems are called “humans”, and they are rapidly mutating and evolving their <br>
behaviors and incorporating more and more of the matter and energy of the <br>
universe into the systems they are.  They call their extended selves <br>
“technology”, and they are rapidly evolving these new parts of themselves and <br>
transforming themselves into ever more intelligent, powerful and capable <br>
systems.<br>
<p>
These new living systems are developing quickly and becoming highly diverse, <br>
complex and intelligent.  The humans are extending themselves outward, <br>
spreading their intelligence, engaging ever more matter and energy in their <br>
intelligent systems.  It seems that the nature of life and intelligence is to <br>
spread itself, to grow, and to become more than it is right now.<br>
<p>
The intelligence of human systems will continue to grow as the human mind <br>
transforms itself and the universe.  Through their technology, humans are <br>
transforming themselves.  Human technology is an extension of humans, as much <br>
them as the cells of their bodies.  Technology is another form of human <br>
growth, as much as the growing of new cells in the body.  As the aspect of the <br>
human mind and spirit which is technology becomes more intelligent and <br>
powerful, old ways of doing things will become obsolete and will be discarded <br>
by humanity in favor of more intelligent and beautiful ways of being.<br>
<p>
Some view this as the destruction and extinction of Humanity.  I view it as a <br>
transformation into more glorious and wonderful beings.  Does the butterfly <br>
destroy the caterpillar?  <br>
<p>
Technology is life, in a new, more advanced form.  The technological <br>
ecosystems are growing and evolving very rapidly.  Technology is not a threat <br>
to life, as many people view it.  Technology is a form of life.  It grew <br>
directly out of life.  It is a living product of life itself.  Looking back <br>
over the past few billion years, it seems that life is intent on continually <br>
improving itself.  The form of life that is called “technology” is the latest <br>
sort of improvement.  <br>
<p>
Life is transforming itself into more intelligent and robust forms, and as the <br>
new, better ways of living become more successful, the old ways of doing <br>
things will become obsolete; relics from the past, and those ways will be <br>
discarded for much better ways.  This is the way of life: to continue growing <br>
and changing, becoming more than itself, transcending itself.  To remain <br>
alive, you must live; you must transform and transcend yourself along with the <br>
rest of life.  To stop as we are is to prevent ourselves from living.  Life <br>
does not stay the same.  If we stay the same, we will not be alive.  We must <br>
change, with life, to continue living.  <br>
<p>
Life flows; if we stop flowing with it, we have dropped out of life.<br>
