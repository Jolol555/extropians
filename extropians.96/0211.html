<i>&gt;further.  Generally, I'm attracted to books and things which were created by</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who think similarly to myself, and I'm attracted even before I really</i><br>
<i>&gt;know anything about the book.  I just see it, and  whammo!  I want it, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt;turns out to be just what I need.  Do you guys have these type of experiences?</i><br>
<p>
Happens to me all the time. I don't have time to read all the books that<br>
call to me in this way. (When more good books are published each year than<br>
were published in the previous year, there's not much chance of Achilles<br>
catching up with this Tortoise.)<br>
<p>
For instance, I finally got around to Kosko's FUZZY THINKING, which has<br>
been on my reading list for a long time. It is exactly what I needed to<br>
read three years ago, when I was fretting about multivalence and theories<br>
of truth. It's great fun to read it now, but I've given up hope on catching<br>
up with the right book at the right time. I expect the three-year time lag<br>
to keep widening.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Well, there's also the idea that people's minds are connected in subtle</i><br>
<i>&gt;ways,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that we form some sort of collective thought space</i><br>
<p>
This would be a difficult hypothesis to test. The subtler the ways of<br>
connection, the more difficult. There's no question that people's minds are<br>
connected in many ways other than the use of language, and if you leave out<br>
the word "telepathy", then you're talking memetics.<br>
