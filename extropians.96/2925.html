According to B. Gates, the next Win95 update will have below functionality <br>
(and more! Watch out for forthcoming Win96 (aka Basilisk97 with new <br>
killer features!)<br>

Subject: "Death Machine" software available on internet<br>
<p>
The following item appears in the November 9 issue of medical journal LANCET <br>
<p>
AUSTRALIANS PROVIDE DELIVERANCE ON THE INTERNET<br>
by Elizabeth Finkel <br>
<p>
The computer programme "Self-Deliverance", which was used in the world's<br>
first legal medically assisted suicide is now on the Internet:<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.taunet.net.au/deliverance/">http://www.taunet.net.au/deliverance/</a>&gt;. The programme is freeware,<br>
available "to allow other developers to modify the programme".<br>
<p>
According to Philip Nitschke, the Northern Territory doctor who assisted the<br>
suicide and helped develop the programme, the purpose of placing it on the<br>
Internet is to demystify notions of "computer death" and also to expedite<br>
the legal processes doctors and patients from other states must undergo<br>
before they can make use of the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally<br>
Ill Act.<br>
<p>
Self-Deliverance was designed by Nitschke and computer programmer Des Carne.<br>
The programme is interactive, and confirms a patient's sentience and<br>
intentions three times. A click on "yes" the third time activates a syringe<br>
driver and a sequential delivery of thiopentone sodium, pentobarbitone<br>
sodium, and pancuronium.<br>
<p>
Initially a simple "press button" option was offered, but, says Nitschke,<br>
"that caused a furor of concern . . . someone might accidentally trip . . .<br>
so we developed this interactive lap-top computer set-up. It also removes<br>
the doctor from the patient's personal space . . . they don't really want<br>
him there". According to Nitschke there have been many misunderstandings but<br>
the use of "Self-Deliverance" makes sense only where it is lawful and<br>
subject to scrutiny.<br>
