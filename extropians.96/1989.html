	This is not an either or question:  vestigal or not vestigal.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
Agreed.<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
Clearly, emotions come from an older part of the brain, the limibic system<br>
we share with mammals, not the medula we share with reptiles (correct me<br>
if I am wrong about this).<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well, that's a big part of the model.  But remember that practically <br>
every interesting molecule in our bodies has at least *two* uses.<br>
<p>
Example: epinephrine is a neurotransmitter as well as a hormone. <br>
It's evident that at least *some* hormones are older than nervous systems <br>
themselves. And that they appear to serve as a backup system for <br>
signalling even in mammals is well known--vide the original discovery of <br>
histamine as the agent for stomach-acid secretion in cows with all <br>
the nerves to their stomachs cut (the histamine-stuffynose connection <br>
was discovered later, and the histamine-orgasm connection later <br>
still, I seem to recall).<br>
<p>
Wild-assed-guess warning!<br>
<p>
This suggests that epinephrine as a heart-speeder-upper may have been <br>
"pressed into" service as a neurotransmitter, or the two functions may <br>
have co-evolved. I don't know who would be able to determine that or <br>
how accurately; archaeo-molecular-biology is a tough science to <br>
practice.<br>
<p>
So, do flatworms (or whatever critters have hormones) have <br>
rudimentary emotions? :)<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;<br>
 Unfortunately, it seems that the<br>
"emotional thinking" we share with other mammals continues on and can only<br>
be overcome with conscious practice. [Anyone watch the Presidential<br>
Debates?]<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well, I have been settling for being able to *browse* my emotional <br>
state and getting practice at focusing my attention.<br>
<p>
I'm afraid my attention is too precious a thing these days to waste <br>
on Tweedledum and Tweedledumber. :\ :P :<br>

MMB, at but not for, etc.<br>
