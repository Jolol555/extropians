<i>&gt;        Bzzzt.  Hummmm.  Fzzzt.  Squeee.  Maybe I was wrong about my</i><br>

<p>
Offense is taken by me, Shaun.  If a quote forms the basis for a metaphor <br>
that is used as the basis for an entire discussion, then I consider <br>
it relevant to address the validity of that quote.<br>
<p>
To be honest, in the short time that I've been on this list, I've <br>
encountered many posts that have taken quite a nasty tone toward <br>
newcomers to the list.  I believe that if I did not have a specific <br>
purpose in following this list I would have unsubscribed already.  If <br>
I didn't know several transhumanists in person, I might have <br>
reached some negative conclusions about them by now.<br>

Sin,<br>
