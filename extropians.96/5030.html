Yes it's a hypothesis, from radar data. Illumination is only starlight,<br>
since the crater shades it from the sun (don't know about reflected<br>
earthlight). Modeling is OK, but I would prefer to see a more direct<br>
confirmation ...<br>

I can't see there being a need for a large population on the Moon. It<br>
doesn't take many people to load dirt into accelerator buckets. There isn't<br>
much worth mining, and you'll need to import a lot of raw materials (the<br>
water reserve isn't large, and you would still probably have to import<br>
nitrogen).<br>
<p>
In his L5 days, Eric Drexler wrote an essay in print that spoke to the<br>
asteroid vs. moon development debate in the National Space Society (I think<br>
it might have been in one of those Pournelle fiction/non-fiction space books<br>
in paperback format). It convinced me that the Moon isn't good for much, and<br>
that we should be planning for the near-earth asteroids instead.<br>
<p>
I've found it hard to get excited about the concept of moon colonies since<br>
then. It/they will look like mine sites in Northern Canada, with<br>
dozens/hundreds of people at most, but no long-term prospect for development.<br>
<p>
I've been to northern minesites. No matter how well set-up they are, no one<br>
who wants to live there. They have a heavy crew rotation schedule (in the<br>
case of the moon, to L5?).<br>
