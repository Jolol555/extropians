In a message dated 96-11-05 05:59:48 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 incorrect, the _We are all self-employed_ meme (M:WaaSE), is being discussed<br>
 as being useful to propagate, therefore it is not now universally current.<br>
 But being responsible for others in our communities is (where i come from)<br>
 a common even old fashioned idea.  Therefore we do not require M:WaaSE to<br>
 exist for help to be given.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
You would be dead if you didn't help your self first.  You are not ABLE to<br>
help others if you are dead, hurt, sick, mentally ill, etc.   This meme is<br>
universally current and is well propagated.   It is a variant of  the meme<br>
"Self preservation".  <br>
<p>
As you have said helping is an old fashioned idea.  Being responsible for<br>
yourself first came long before helping others.  A dead person can can not<br>
help anybody.  Therefore, taking care of yourself _must_ come before helping<br>
anybody else.  Mentally ill people son can not help other mentally ill before<br>
getting themselves cured first.   <br>
<p>
Do you really think the meme "self-preservation" came AFTER the meme "help<br>
(be responsible for) others"?  Do you think "be responsible for others"<br>
(selflessness, altruism) is a wider held meme than "self preservation"<br>
 (selfishness)?  <br>
<p>
Who cares?  Because, I think "we are all self employed" encompasses _both_<br>
ideas.  The business of self employment needs to survive IN ORDER TO  be<br>
responsible to serve customers (help others).  Self-preservation CAUSES<br>
people being _able_ to help others.  It's up to them then if they choose to<br>
do so.<br>
