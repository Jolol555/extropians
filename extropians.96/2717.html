<i>&gt;Actually, there are a few cetaceans that have a higher brain mass to body</i><br>
<i>&gt;mass ratio that humans.  The dolphin is one of them.  The dolphin also has a</i><br>
<i>&gt;more convoluted brain than humans.  They exhibit complex intelligent speech</i><br>
<i>&gt;patterns as well.</i><br>
<p>
How intelligent ARE they?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I used to work on DSP applications, mostly audio, but occasionally graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt;oriented.  Visual processing applications almost always require an order of</i><br>
<i>&gt;magnitude more processing power than audio ones.  I have heard the argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;before, but I have a difficult time believing that cetaceans use more of</i><br>
<i>&gt;their brain for audio processing than we use for vision.  State-of-the-art</i><br>
<i>&gt;audio rendering software can run in realtime on a processor capable of less</i><br>
<i>&gt;than 200-mips.  </i><br>
<p>
Does this have to do with blowing virtual air though a virtual model to<br>
produce a sound? I saw on the telivision show "Beyond 2000" a technology<br>
where they would stick a instrument into a person's throat and map out<br>
their voice box with a laser and make a 3D model of it. With the 3D model<br>
they were able to make the person actually sing using the model. When the<br>
internet VR 'metaverse' comes around in say 5-10 yrs max we will be able to<br>
create characteristic voices for our avatars. Does anyone know of a link to<br>
ongoing research about this topic?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, our hearing is more capable than most people think.  I have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiments where blind people were able to echo-locate objects with a cross</i><br>
<i>&gt;section of 1 square inch in a room using their own voice, and could detect</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes in position of 3" at a distance of 15' of objects with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;cross-section of 1 square inch.  Non-blind people tend to only have a range</i><br>
<i>&gt;of 3-7', but everyone possesses the capability.  I actually took one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;these tests.  My effective range was 5-6'.  Most people don't know they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;do it until they try.</i><br>
<p>
What evolutionary advantage does this pose?<br>
