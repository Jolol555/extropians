Eric Watt Forste offers, for the U.S., a decentralization of power back to<br>
the states as one step on the path toward incrementally moving toward a<br>
regime of anarcho-capitalsim.  I'm all for this, to the extent that it<br>
implements polycentric legalism.  However, I see each state claiming total<br>
sovereignty within its own territory (while implementing laws different from<br>
other states) and thus this path seems to take us no closer to a stateless<br>
world.  In fact it may not really be an instance of legal polycentricity any<br>
more than the international legal order is, because of the concept of the<br>
territorial state.  Nothing in the modern "states' rights" movement seems to<br>
point to a devolution of state power, per se.<br>
<p>
Also, BTW, I think your reference to Friedman's interesting work on the<br>
Icelandic example, Eric,  bears out my original thesis regarding the relative<br>
ease of implementing agoric legal systems in truly "new worlds".  As I<br>
recall, that regime developed amongst colonists (political refugees)<br>
emigrating from Scandinavia to essentially unpeopled country.<br>
<p>
Then Robin Hanson writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My current approach to "incremental" is in terms of the intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;arguments offered to limit freedom of contract.  Full freedom of</i><br>
<i>&gt;contract gets us everything we want, and we already have a bit of</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom.  So I focus on increasing the scope of freedom of contract by</i><br>
<i>&gt;indentifying first the weakest arguments for limiting such freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and hoping to damage them enough to topple the limits which rest only on</i><br>
<i>&gt;those arguments.  And to make my counter-arguments stick as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible, I am formalizing them.  See my papers on democratic failure</i><br>
<i>&gt;and product bans.</i><br>
<p>
This certainly has promise and I'll search for these papers at your web site,<br>
Robin, if they're there.  Perhaps you could forward URLs to me by private<br>
e-mail?  The problem I see is that the regimes of law with which I'm familiar<br>
place explicit boundaries on the realm of contract with concepts such a "void<br>
for illegality" and the like.  Attacking these boundaries head-on will surely<br>
mobilize the survival instincts of the state, won't it?<br>
