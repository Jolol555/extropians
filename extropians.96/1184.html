Kathryn, the rise of fuzzy logic is not an excuse for mental sloppiness!<br>
Fuzzy logic is every bit as formal and exacting as binary logic.  It's<br>
not a free pass allowing every handwaver and charlatan to claim that he<br>
has the backing of science and mathematics.  It deals with uncertain<br>
facts very formally, and you can *NOT* claim the backing of Bart Kosko<br>
if what you are trying to do is to manipulate uncertain facts sloppily.<br>
<p>
Fuzzy logic *IS* a logic (ie. a mathematical formalism), not a charter<br>
for denial of logic or mathematics.  Quite the opposite:  reasoning with<br>
fuzzy sets is *AT LEAST* as precise as reasoning with 2-valued sets,<br>
since it's a superset of binary logic, and often it is *MORE* precise<br>
when used to describe the factual world because it allows reasoning with<br>
real measured values instead of requiring those real values to be<br>
approximated by zero or one, which would *lose* precision.<br>
<p>
I think that you have misunderstood Kosko badly, possibly because of the<br>
informal nature of his most popular paperback.  I suggest that you leaf<br>
through one of his textbooks if you gained the impression that fuzzy<br>
logic is not strict, formal, mathematical, and wonderfully more precise<br>
than binary logic as a means of reasoning about the world.<br>
