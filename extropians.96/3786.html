<i>&gt;&gt; I have never heard of this phenomenon.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nor me.</i><br>
<p>
I can't help it if you guys are a decade or two behind the times in <br>
protein science.  Go to a meeting of the Molecular Graphics Society, <br>
and look at some animations of proteins.  They do in fact behave <br>
as I described.  <br>

<i>&gt; There is a type of "active" composite that has the properties you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; describing.  It is a laminate composite consisting of piezo-electric</i><br>
<i>&gt; ceramics  and shape-memory alloys from the nickel-titanium family.  </i><br>
<p>
Beautiful.  Sounds like something that could be scaled down.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When vibrations hit the ceramic outer laminate, the ceramic acts as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; transducer, converting the vibration into an electrical signal.  </i><br>
<p>
Ok.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The signal is inverted ... and fed into the shape-memory alloy.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The alloy flexes and reproduces the inverted signal, similar to a </i><br>
<i>&gt; speaker, through the ceramic.</i><br>
<p>
In other words the alloy turns the electrical signal back into sound, and <br>
sends it back through the ceramic, but it is inverted, and so cancels out <br>
the original sound.  Neat.  But this is going to defeat our purpose, <br>
because -- <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The net effect is that the material nulls the vibration, but produces heat</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the excess energy.  </i><br>
<p>
So the big, regular vibrations are replaced by small, random vibrations, <br>
i.e. heat.  The noise is attenuated, and the material becomes warmer.  <br>
The thing is, we are trying to design a refrigerator.  When a piece of <br>
this material absorbs the sound in a room, does it lower the temperature <br>
of the air?  No!  The material itself becomes warmer, and this heat is <br>
radiated right back into the air.  <br>
<p>
This composite is wonderful stuff, and I'd like to have a house made of <br>
it.  Walls that absorb all noise!!  I'd like to see entire cities made of it.  <br>
Silent cities.  That would be heaven.  But this composite doesn't solve <br>
the problem we were trying to solve in the cell.  <br>
<p>
We want to take the energy from the protein's vibrations, and send that <br>
energy somewhere else, far away from the protein (or far away from <br>
whatever we are trying to refrigerate).  <br>
<p>
Let's go back to the first step.  We put the ceramic next to the material <br>
to be refrigerated.  The ceramic acts as a transducer, and converts the <br>
sound into an electrical signal.  I'm not sure how this would work at the <br>
atomic level, but suppose it does.  <br>
<p>
Now, what you want to do is send that signal elsewhere, to a heat sink, <br>
and *then* have it pass through a resistance, thus generating heat --  <br>
far enough away so the heat stays away from the material we are trying <br>
to refrigerate.  <br>
<p>
Some part of this process has to involve a net input of energy.  <br>
I guess the energy would be required to maintain the heat sink at a <br>
lower potential than the ceramic material.  <br>

<i>&gt; What about the microtubuli? They are sturdy, good at self-organization </i><br>
<i>&gt; and if we could figure out how to use the dyneines and kinesines, </i><br>
<i>&gt; we could move molecules along them as we want. If we also could </i><br>
<i>&gt; fixate the tubuli, they might make a good scaffolding. </i><br>
<p>
I agree.  Microtubuli are just sitting there begging to be made into <br>
nanocomputers.  The question is how to get a handle on these things.  <br>
How does one design a cell in which microtubuli form a scaffold or <br>
some other useful structure?<br>
  <br>
One possibility is to have a vat with a large number of cells, filter out <br>
the ones that have microtubuli in some approximation to the desired <br>
configuration, and only let those cells reproduce (discard the other <br>
cells).  After n generations, it should be possible to breed cells to fairly <br>
exact specifications.      <br>
<p>
--------------<br>
Design problem #1 is the first of a long series.  There is also the inverse <br>
problem, i.e. how to imbed cells in machines.  This discussion of <br>
combining cells and machines should take place among the employees <br>
of a company, and the upshot of the discussion should be a decision <br>
about which product to work on next.  <br>
