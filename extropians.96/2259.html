Sounds nice, but you are not describing life as an upload, you are<br>
describing life in a perfect virtual reality with super-AI. Granted, when<br>
ew can do uploading, we will have so much computing power and probably AI<br>
that the potential for virtual reality is going to be awesome (it better<br>
be, or the newly uploaded people will go slowly insane from badly rendered<br>
drinks or bugs in their body models). <br>
<p>
Yes, I would definitely start working on building worlds (not entire<br>
universes at first), but their complexities are still limited by the<br>
amount of computation power we have - and that will be limited and cost<br>
money too. Read _Permutation City_ by Greg Egan for some ideas.<br>
<p>
The problem I see with many of the uploading scenarios I hear on this list<br>
is that they are all too often of the kind "And after you are uploaded,<br>
you become God." It isn't that simple - working uploading won't change<br>
your mind very much (if it did, it wouldn't be you that emerged in<br>
cyberspace). So when you are 'reborn' you will be an emulation of 10^11<br>
neurons, their activity and lots of other pseudobiological data. Of<br>
course, self-transformation now becomes almost too trivial (remember to<br>
make backups often!) and you will be able to change much of your<br>
structure. But you won't immediately be able to go far beyond your old<br>
limits, they have to be untangled and enhanced away. This will require a<br>
lot of *work*. It will quite likely be painful and tiring (in a mental<br>
sense). It will take time. <br>
<p>
The exception may be uploading through gradual extension: when you become<br>
100% uploaded, you are already quite evolved. But you are still far from<br>
being a god. <br>
