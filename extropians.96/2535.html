<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: You claim that it's "not 'the voice of the people'," </i><br>
<i>&gt; yet you've not presented an argument to support your claim.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You make the claim and then observe that people with money have </i><br>
<i>&gt; influence. True enough. You then seem to concede my observation</i><br>
<i>&gt; in part, that it's the "voice of people who count."</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But after all this, my point that the allocation of capital in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the market is the voice of the people, still holds. The "people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who count" are the people who the people vote for, the people </i><br>
<i>&gt; who the people count on. </i><br>
<p>
People with money do not neccessarily get it from the majority of people.<br>
Do you think the majority of people want to pay for sonic toothbrushes?<br>
Only the rich do. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I vote for those who most effectively service my needs. A cruel </i><br>
<i>&gt; task master am I. My ballots are limited only by the degree to </i><br>
<i>&gt; which I do or do not service the needs of others. Democracy </i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot possibly give all candidates an equal share of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; votes, such would be the logical abolition of the demo-</i><br>
<i>&gt; cratic process, and yet that's exactly what the soc-</i><br>
<i>&gt; ialist yearns for.</i><br>
<p>
You have more ballots than most people. If you become rich enough, it<br>
doesn't matter what other people think, you can impose your will on them. <br>
That's what I think will happen with unrestrained capitalism. You will<br>
either get an dictatorial oligarchy with more money than everybody else,<br>
or you willget a traditional Marxist revolution type thing. I don't like <br>
either ofthose things.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Oh, great, and The Words of God(tm), are a good basis for dealing with </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; society. Why should we accept poverty? If we are talkking about such </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; grandiose things as uploading, Dyson Spheres and immortality, why can't </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; we discuss utopias for all. It shouldn't be beyond humanity's grasp. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: We'll just wave our magic wand -- utopias for all </i><br>
<i>&gt; and for all a central planner. The wonders of magic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It occurs to me that I presented you with evidence that your anarcho-</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialist ideas required central planners, and you never presented </i><br>
<i>&gt; a logical argument to defeat that point, in fact I think you just </i><br>
<i>&gt; avoided it.  Nevertheless, here you are plowing full steam ahead </i><br>
<i>&gt; with your illogical utopias. This therefore forces me to toward </i><br>
<i>&gt; the conclusion that your not an honest but a magical thinker.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Did I miss your counter argument?</i><br>
<p>
Going back through the posts I think it was you who dropped off the<br>
argument.<br>
<p>
Why is an utopia illogical? <br>
<p>
 I'm advocating voluntary socialism, pretty much. No I can't<br>
impose this by force, because that's just not right. <br>
<p>
I like democracy, but only when there's options for the minority as well<br>
as the majority. <br>
<p>
Okay, thought experiment:<br>
<p>
We get rid of all coercive institutions, both government and corporations.<br>
Then we see what social structures turn up. You say the natural<br>
relationship between humans is trade. I say it's cooperation. I<br>
think our ability to cooperate was vital to our evolutionary<br>
success. <br>
<p>
Only when a small minority obtain power through generally nasty means, can<br>
they tell everybody else that these are the rules they must follow.     <br>
<p>
Why do you equate the desire for a good life for all with central<br>
planning. I hate and fear government just as much as you do. But I also<br>
hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their<br>
advertising and poison my water with their pollution. Uggh, there must be<br>
a better way than unrestrained capitalism. <br>
