I don't know about other countries, but I know that in the United States,<br>
over 50% of dollars paid to the medical industry are paid by the Federal<br>
government. I suspect this (and certain inefficient regulations) has a<br>
great deal to do with escalating costs.<br>

<p>
Techniques for manufacturing new designs of computing hardware that can<br>
instantiate neural and fuzzy computational processes are developing *much*<br>
more rapidly than our understanding of the brain. I expect that by the time<br>
we develop a theoretical understanding of the nonlinear computational<br>
processes evolved within large unsupervised feedback nets, the hardware<br>
basis for cognitive prostheses will likely be in place.<br>
<p>
Or perhaps a more rhetorically effective way to put that: I don't see much<br>
reason to think that cognitive science (which is currently stuck in a<br>
technologically fruitful zone which has very little to do with developing a<br>
theoretical understanding of the way the human brain actually computes)<br>
will *overtake* the engineering of fully-parallel computing hardware, which<br>
is currently rocketing along at a merry pace.<br>
<p>
And we're going to need both these pieces of the puzzle in place before we<br>
can start doing serious work on soft incremental uploads.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;1) I doubt it will be neural nets, more likely we will see coupling of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   brittle computer algebra packages (Mathematica, MatLab, etc.) first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   bioNN computational prowess is pretty awesome -- we'll need some time</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to approach this order of magnitude. Complementary skills.</i><br>
<p>
But I suspect we'll need an understanding of the computational processes in<br>
the brain before we can start hooking any *new* functionality into it, and<br>
once we have that understanding, we'll probably use it to build some of the<br>
new functionality. Granted that this understanding is nowhere in sight at<br>
the moment.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this fine-grain incremental upload is infeasible, merely beckoning to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the surviving set of strange attractors constituting your personality</i><br>
<i>&gt;with virgin circuitry will depend on their evolution-shaped propensity to</i><br>
<i>&gt;cross over into new territory. Since this never happens in real life (though</i><br>
<i>&gt;lesion tolerance &amp; recovery is based on semi-dormant, redundant circuitry</i><br>
<i>&gt;taking over the part of vanquished one), it is not likely to work.</i><br>
<p>
Strange. Your parenthesis, which I fully agree with, seems to completely<br>
contradict your main statement. I don't understand why you don't think that<br>
"semi-dormant, redundant" silicon circuitry could not similarly be<br>
automatically brought into play by the brain as its original tissues fail.<br>
Of course we don't yet understand the processes by which the brain replaces<br>
damaged tissues by bringing new synapses and neurons into play, retraining<br>
them to do the lost functionality, but we certainly do know that it<br>
happens. That sounds like an existence proof to me.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; "identity" has gradually moved "into" the silicon prostheses, because</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I doubt identity has the properties of a liquid. (If it had, it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely nice of the evolution to provide us with it without</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary fitness requiring such a useful trait).</i><br>
<p>
I doubt that identity has any properties at all that we can firmly identify<br>
at this point. So I counter by saying that I doubt that identity has the<br>
properties of a solid, either. Some facts of the universe are just facts of<br>
the universe, and one of them is that computational processes in a neural<br>
network are generally distributed throughout the whole network, and that<br>
neural networks, as they learn, build computational structures within<br>
whatever hardware they're connected to in the right way. Evolution just<br>
happened to hit upon the trick of neural networks as a solution for<br>
computational problems faced by animals. That solution may have plenty of<br>
properties that aren't selected for, if those properties are inseparable<br>
from the properties that *are* selected for (like being able to make fast<br>
learned nonlinear transformations of complex time-varying stimuli into<br>
complex time-varying motor activity, and learning those transformations<br>
without supervision).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Alas, I have grown to distrust this Proteus guy (... you never know who he'll</i><br>
<i>&gt;be next ;). Most neuroscientists I know are highly sceptical about</i><br>
<i>&gt;unbound malleability of cerebral circuitry.</i><br>
<p>
Cognitive science is a highly interdisciplinary field, and most<br>
psychologists I know who understand anything about computation are firmly<br>
convinced of the plasticity of mind. I said nothing about "unbound". It's<br>
important to distinguish between computational processes and the<br>
instantiating hardware, even though this is devilishly difficult to do in<br>
the case of the human brain, just as it is with the genetic apparatus.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If incremental soft uploads are</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible at all, they won't come before Singularity -- and that will be too</i><br>
<i>&gt;late. Contrary to Vinge's headbands, I doubt we'll see much of it prior to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Singularity, when every single rule is likely to be broken -- including</i><br>
<i>&gt;the necessity to rely on headbands (or heads).</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand this kind of thinking at all. Clearly, whatever<br>
technologies we seek to rely on to get what we want are going to have to<br>
evolve gradually. They are not going to magically appear out of an unfunded<br>
void. There are strong incentives for the development of cognitive<br>
prostheses; on the other hand, there's practically *no* economic pressure<br>
for the development of "hard, sudden uploads"... in fact, I can't see any<br>
pressure for this at all outside of the cryonics community. But of course I<br>
want to see research move forward on every front, and I certainly *do* want<br>
to see those patients in suspension restored to health.<br>
