NO! You just fell into a common psychological trap: if something is said<br>
with confidence and in scientese, it is probably true. That is not a good<br>
heuristic, and quite often used by less than scientific environmentalists<br>
(like Rifkin, who talks about his completely erroneous "fourth law of<br>
thermodynamics"). You should instead demand clarification: "What the ****<br>
is the Bekenstein Bound?!" <br>
<p>
A quick answer: if you accept the uncertainty relations of quantum<br>
mechanics, it follows that you cannot distinguish systems that are similar<br>
enough (Delta x * Delta p &gt;= hbar) using any means. This in turn implies<br>
that you cannot store information as different states if they are too<br>
similar. Now, if you try to store information in a spherical volume with a<br>
finite amount of matter/energy inside, the uncertainty relations tell you<br>
that there is a limit of how many distinguishable states there can be<br>
inside, ergo the amount of information you can store there. This is the<br>
Bekenstein Bound, which says that the amount of information that can be<br>
stored is proportional to the radius and the energy inside the volume (it<br>
is a very loose bound, you can cram several megabytes into a hydrogen atom<br>
and around 10^80 or so bits into the solar system). <br>
<p>
The Minkowsky space part was mostly a hedge to avoid having to deal with <br>
curved space and all that. It is just plain, flat spacetime according to <br>
special relativity.<br>
<p>
(Fun problem: think of how to circumvent the Bekenstein Bound and get <br>
infinite information. It is possible in theory)<br>
