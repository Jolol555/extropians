Ira Brodsky looks behind the curtain and says to me, "Ah ha!  So *you* are the <br>
AI. &lt;g&gt;"<br>
<p>
I'm proud to proclaim that I am indeed artificially intelligent.  The <br>
intelligence I am currently using is the result of tremendous amounts of <br>
mental training that I have undergone.  Most of my intelligence is my own <br>
creation, and a lot of it is from other people who have taught me and from <br>
studying other people's work.  <br>
<p>
If something is artificial, that means it is an artifact, created by humans.  <br>
It does not mean "less than real" or "inferior", as many interpret it.  <br>
Everything consciously created is, by definition, "artificial".  <br>
<p>
My intelligence is almost entirely my own creation and the creation of other <br>
humans whom I have learned from.  The basic "hardware" was provided by <br>
evolution, but the brilliant intelligence was something created by myself and <br>
other humans, and thus is "artificial".<br>
<p>
The more we direct our growth, the more artificial and self-created we become. <br>
 I am proud to be artificially intelligent, and I am working dilligently on <br>
becoming even more so.<br>
