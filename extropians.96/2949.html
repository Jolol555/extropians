Lyle Burkhead has informed me that I have discovered the biggest sacred cow in <br>
the Extropian herd with my "God" post.  Is that true?  Are you guys all <br>
dogmatic athiests?<br>
<p>
Well, it's obvious that John Clark is.  It seems like my post triggered of <br>
some sort of pre-recorded response in John, and he treated us all to the <br>
typical athiest rant about the logical fallacy of an omnipotent God and that <br>
such a being would never want to establish communication with lowly finite <br>
beings such as ourselves.  It seems that John's dogmatism has interfered with <br>
his reading comprehension capibilities (Dogmatism will ruin your mind; Just <br>
Say No!).  If my post is read again, it will be clear that I said nothing <br>
about any *omnipotent* or *omniscient* God.  Imagine ourselves in a few <br>
thousand or million years.  That's the sort of God I was talking about.  My <br>
post makes that clear, to those whose minds aren't intoxicated by dogmatism.<br>
<p>
When we are very advanced, it is likely that we will be able to create <br>
mini-universes (sometimes called "baby universes").  Perhaps we will find ways <br>
to make universes bubble off of our own, and we will be able to design the <br>
basic features of these universes.  If we can maintain some sort of connection <br>
with these universes, then perhaps we could find ways of getting them to do <br>
useful work for us.  Perhaps universes which exhibit life, intelligence and <br>
creativity will be especially useful to us, and we will seek to create living, <br>
intelligent universes, so that we can use their intelligence to help us solve <br>
problems, much like we use transistors in computer systems to help us solve <br>
problems now.  It seems likely that intelligence and creativity would be so <br>
useful to us that we would want to encourage and speed up its development in <br>
any universes which began to display these qualities.  It seems useful to find <br>
ways to influence these universes, to nudge them in the directions we want <br>
them to go.  I don't know how much influence we would have or how well we <br>
would know all the details of these universes, but likely it would be less <br>
than perfect.  If we could influence conscious, sentient beings to develop in <br>
a universe, it would be in our interest to assist them in their progress, <br>
since we are using their universe to solve problems for us, and the more <br>
intelligent and creative the universe is, the more useful it will be to us.  <br>
The universes we create would probably develop through evolution, but if we <br>
could have some influence over certain things, we may be able to help nudge <br>
the evolution more in the ways we want it to develop.  We probably wouldn't <br>
have perfect control and couldn't make everything exactly the way we wanted <br>
to, but we may have *some* control.  Perhaps as universes become more <br>
conscious and intelligent, it would become easier for us to influence them as <br>
they would be more aware of and able to decode the signals we would send into <br>
the universe by altering whatever we can.  If the universes become intelligent <br>
enough, perhaps we could have established some very high quality communication <br>
with the intelligence of those universes, and perhaps we could design ways for <br>
these universes to commuincate with each other to some degree, so we could <br>
organize them into a very large system, which would be even more intelligent <br>
and useful to us than any of its components.  Perhaps these baby universes <br>
would create universes within themselves also and become even more intelligent <br>
and useful to us.  These are some of the computers of the future that I am <br>
speculating about here.<br>
<p>
All I was doing with my original God post was bringing up the *possibility* <br>
that we won't be the first ones to do this.  I don't think it's unreasonable <br>
to believe that if it's possible for us to create and influence the <br>
development of  universes, that perhaps someone else is already doing this and <br>
our universe is one of the ones they created.  John, I don't know if your <br>
athiestic dogmatism allows you to think clearly, but why do you insist that we <br>
will be the first ones to create universes?  Do you think that it may even be <br>
possible for us to create entire universes at some point in the future?  If <br>
so, why couldn't a similar being to our future selves have been able to do the <br>
same type of thing and create our universe?<br>
<p>
If we become capable of creating universes similar to our own, it seems <br>
possible and likely that another conscious being created our universe.  Just <br>
to make it clear (for the dogmatically intoxicated and mentally impaired): I'm <br>
not saying this being is omnipotent; I'm just saying that it is a conscious <br>
being who is very powerful, powerful enough to create universes.  This being <br>
may have some sort of limited influence over our universe, and as we become <br>
more conscious and intelligent, we may become more adept at interpreting the <br>
signals the being is sending into our universe to influence us (if there is <br>
such a being sending signals).  We may find that following these <br>
"instructions" consistently brings us great progress, and so we would learn to <br>
trust and follow these "instructions".<br>
<p>
I can't see any way to put this *possibility* out of my mind.  And don't <br>
anybody give me the standard athiestic arguments; I am very familiar with them <br>
already.  *Think* about what I have written, and respond out of intelligence, <br>
not out of dogmatic habit.<br>
<p>
It seems like many people become athiests to escape the trap of theism, but <br>
all they've really done is exchange one dogmatic trap for another.  It doesn't <br>
matter whether you are theistic or atheistic; if you're dogmatic in your <br>
thinking you're mentally retarded.  You slow your learning rate way down.<br>
