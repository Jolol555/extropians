<i>&gt; &gt;If suspended animation is what you're after, why isn't any effort going</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;toward hormonal suspension or slowing of metabolic processes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's exactly what hypothermia does. Continuing the hypothermia to low</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough temperatures slow all biological processes so much that</i><br>
<i>&gt; "hibernation" without decay for 100's of years is possible. If the organism</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be cooled to such temperatures without ice crystallization (a process</i><br>
<i>&gt; called vitrification) then no damage to the organism whatsoever occurs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
But hypothermia is an induced metabolic suspension, with the body still<br>
burning sugars at the normal rate, etc. A true metabolic suppression<br>
should be experienced as conciously as though the rest of the world was<br>
speeding up around you, while the subject slows down.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Such drug induced hybernation in my opinion is much more realizable and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;most probably less damaging.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No hibernating animals, even frozen frogs and fish, can survive in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; state for longer than the normal amount of time for which they hibernate</i><br>
<i>&gt; (less than a year).</i><br>
<p>
Sure, because they don't need to. Do we know how they can stay under<br>
that long? if so this should be used as a safe interim solution for<br>
doubling or tripling terminal patients life expectancy by repeated<br>
hybernations with interim waking periods for refueling etc...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The fact that there have been documented cases of individuals going into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;spontaneous hybernation for years at a time makes me wonder why no effort</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is going on in this area. Surely slowing people's metabolic rate to 1</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;heartbeat per minute would not only be a great interim solution to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;outright suspension, but advantageous for use in surgery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds life the story of Rip Van Winkle to me. I've never heard of such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing. Are you thinking of comma's, or vegetative states, etc? These people</i><br>
<i>&gt; all need and get feeding and other bodily needs attended to. Do you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; any references to such examples of slowed metabolism? Maybe the reason why</i><br>
<i>&gt; no one is giving effort to this area is that there are no such examples and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the idea does not make physiological sense.</i><br>
<p>
I read a big article in Discover Magazine years ago (mid 80s) by a<br>
doctor who had gone on a house call early in his career. When he got<br>
there, he took care of the patient, then noticed a rather still<br>
individual in a chair. "oh thats just grandpa" they said. He had a pulse<br>
of one or two beats a minute. According to the family he had been this<br>
way for a decade or so. Upon thyroid treatment, he was brought back to<br>
normal metabolic rates, only to find that he was terminal with a large<br>
tumor that had also been dormant during that period....<br>
