Lyle, please do not quit the list. Yeah, Eliezer gets off his medication<br>
from time to time, but he does serve a motivating purpose. Secondly,<br>
this list is not just a caffe clatch for armchair philosphers, but a<br>
forum for communication and coordination of our efforts to actively help<br>
bring about the technologies and memtic shifts needed to attain a<br>
positive transhuman shift. If this was just for yacking, I would not<br>
waste another minute here, as I have vastly more important things to do<br>
than blow smoke up people asses trying to impress them with my<br>
philosophical prowess (you'll notice I don't do much of that anyway).<br>
THings like, bringing about a new type of propulsion technology for<br>
spacecraft. Hell, the snow is flying outside, its time for me to go<br>
skiing.<br>
<p>
Despite Eliezer's emotional instability at times, he is trying to be<br>
proactive, which is what is needed of each of us.<br>
