[I'm also sending this to the Extropians list, where Anders now dwells part<br>
of the time.]<br>
<p>
At this early stage, I'm encouraged by the response to the call for help in<br>
getting funding and other help with EXTRO-3: The Third Extropy Institute<br>
Conference on Transhumanist Thought. <br>
<p>
Although you'll already know this, I want to publically thanks Sean Hastings<br>
for his $1,000 contribution directed toward making it possible for Anders<br>
Sandberg -- surely one of the very most liked and well-informed<br>
transhumanists -- to come all the way from Sweden to the event next year.<br>
Thank you Sean! It couldn't happen to a better guy Anders!<br>
<p>
Details of the conference are still to be worked out. I'll be wanting to<br>
form an organizational team to discuss the topics, speakers, and other<br>
details, and to publicize the event. If you're interested in joining the<br>
team please contact me. Some of the team will need to be local to the<br>
planned event, but others certainly need not be nearby.<br>
<p>
EXTRO-3 will very likely take place in northern California, probably in<br>
Sunnyvale. This is where EXTRO-1 was held; EXTRO-2 was in Los Angeles. Since<br>
California has the highest concentration of transhumanists, it makes it<br>
easier for more people to come if held here. Once there are several times as<br>
many of us, I expect to see conferences in several places each year. In the<br>
meantime, Extropy Institute will gradually bring events to more places by<br>
smaller one day conferences/seminars, in addition to the two-day EXTRO<br>
conference. (It might be more like 2 1/2 days this time.)<br>

Upward and Outward!<br>
