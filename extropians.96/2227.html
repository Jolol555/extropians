?  I'm assuming that Lyle is yanking our chain, but the above statement<br>
makes no more sense than E. Shaun Russell's diatribe on AIs somehow<br>
having their own culture.  If there is an artificial entity which has<br>
been indistinguishable from a natural human at a complex level of<br>
operation, it really doesn't matter if humanity is its native mode of<br>
thought or if it's just faking our mental species.  The feat would still<br>
be wondrous.<br>

There's something in my garden, it's been there for a week.<br>
I tried to feed it crackers, but that only made it squeak.<br>
I tried to wash its scaly head, but all it did was cry,<br>
So I think I'll put it back to bed, and sing it a lullaby:<br>
A monster's lullaby:<br>
