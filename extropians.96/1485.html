Many years ago I read a science fiction story which went along these <br>
lines:  <br>
<p>
Dr. Paget was a mad scientist who found a way to create animals <br>
with human intelligence.  By "human intelligence" I mean the animals <br>
have a causal model of the world, as we do.  A Paget-dog (or padog) <br>
can cross the street without getting run over, just like we can.  <br>
It understands its situation, it can make plans, it can communicate <br>
(using improvised signals and gestures) with other Paget-animals.  <br>
Dr. Paget used horses, dogs, cats, rats, and mice in his experiment.  <br>
So far all this is interesting but harmless, yes?  <br>
<p>
But then the animals escape from the lab.  <br>
<p>
The horses are quickly caught.  Horses are too big to hide and they <br>
reproduce slowly.  They never had a chance.  But the smaller animals <br>
disappear into the countryside.  <br>
<p>
Some of the padogs and pacats are caught and killed.  The point is <br>
not lost on the other padogs and pacats.  They know that humans are <br>
The Enemy, and they act accordingly.  Soon there is a state of open <br>
warfare between humans and Paget-animals (usually known simply as <br>
"pagets").  Dr. Paget is lynched, and his son, who narrates the story, <br>
changes his name to avoid the same fate.  <br>
<p>
A pacat who encounters a human will simply jump up into the human's <br>
face, scratch his eyes out, and jump back to the ground before the <br>
human can react.  Padogs run in packs and become expert at killing <br>
humans.  Parats and pamice learn to chew the insulation off wires, thus <br>
starting fires and making any kind of electrical equipment unusable.  <br>
Cars and trucks are also unusable, because the pagets chew up the <br>
fuel lines, v-belts, hoses, and tires.  Civilized life becomes impossible.  <br>
Humans revert to pre-industrial society.  Back to the jungle.  <br>
<p>
The pagets reproduce much faster than humans, especially after <br>
parats discover how easy it is to kill human babies.  <br>
<p>
After a few decades, the human population is reduced to a few million <br>
(in the whole world!) living in a state of siege.  <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, Dr. Paget didn't find a way to create insects or bacteria <br>
with human intelligence.  That would be even more fun.  <br>
<p>
As I said before, I don't think it is possible to miniaturize humans.  <br>
But if I am wrong, I don't see how the Paget-scenario can be avoided.  <br>
Small creatures (or robots) with human intelligence won't be our <br>
slaves, at least not very long.  Assuming they really do have human <br>
intelligence, they will soon find a way to escape (perhaps with help <br>
from sympathetic humans, or humans with more schadenfreude than <br>
sense).  Then we will try to hunt them down, and war will ensue.  <br>
How else could it turn out?  <br>
<p>
