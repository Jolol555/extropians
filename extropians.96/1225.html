In High School English class one day (about 1961) there was a huge<br>
debate about<br>
"is there a God" into which I made the above suggestion. Of course<br>
nobody had a<br>
clue about what I was saying...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, I can see a lot of people on this list recoiling from the idea that we</i><br>

<i>&gt; possiblilty that a lot of the Mystical, New-Age, Religious "bullshit" is</i><br>

<i>&gt; possibility that we DO have some kind of "spirit" or "soul", in relation to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lifetime we are experiencing (that is, that we have the major part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves living somewhere else besides this lifetime).</i><br>
<p>
Yup, but the access rules seem a bit funky and very poorly designed.<br>
Where is<br>
that "soul" icon on my display screen??<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But, then again, maybe not, but I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; not finding it easy to dismiss the idea that I *MAY* already be living in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtual world.  How could I tell the difference?</i><br>
<p>
To misstate some of the philosphers who feel that consciousness is an<br>
irreducible<br>
non materialistic fact, go ask your zombie...<br>
