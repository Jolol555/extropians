<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you understand how a computer does arithmetic you must understand what  </i><br>
<i>&gt;the machine will do, what its output will be, when it takes 5203 to the 127 </i><br>
<i>&gt;power. So tell me, what is 5203 ^127?  My point is that somebody could be </i><br>
<i>&gt;very familiar with every one on the 26 letters in the English Language but </i><br>
<i>&gt;still not understand the subtly in Shakespeare.</i><br>
<p>
I could calculate 5203^127, albeit pretty slowly.  A computer could<br>
calculate it as well, and much faster too.  And for every single bitwise<br>
operation, I could show you exactly what process is going on in the ALU at a<br>
transistor by transistor level.  Of course, with numbers this big, you would<br>
be looking at multi-precision arithmetic since the registers can't currently<br>
handle numbers this big, but this is a minor detail.<br>
<p>
Actually, I think that arithmetic computation is a really poor example of<br>
something that we don't (can't) understand.  It is a simple, deterministic<br>
process.  There are no unknown variables.  If this wasn't the case, software<br>
would be non-deterministic (which it isn't).<br>
<p>
As for Shakespeare and letters of the alphabet, semantic and contextual<br>
comprehension is arguably a non-deterministic process and therefore could be<br>
unknowable by definition.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;I *do* understand turbulence (as well as anyone does).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I will concede that you do understand turbulence, as well as anyone does.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;our difficulty in adequately describing turbulence has to</i><br>
do                 <br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;with the complexity of the system   </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I agree. </i><br>
<p>
I would submit that everything we don't understand or can't predict is based<br>
entirely on we 1) can't measure something, 2) can't find something, or 3)<br>
computational complexity is too high.<br>
<p>
Using this as a metric, I can't think of a single thing we don't understand<br>
that doesn't fall under one or more of these categories.<br>
                  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                &gt;a level of complexity not found in the study of elementary</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;arithmetic logic structures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's true that the sort of complexity seen in turbulence is not found in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;structure of a CPU, but it is found in the operation of a CPU.</i><br>
                  <br>
Granted, CPU operation is complex, especially these days, but it was all<br>
done by humans, and there are people who could tell you how each part works<br>
on a transistor by transistor basis.  Obviously, with a device this complex,<br>
it takes many people and experts to design it.  But understanding each of<br>
the parts is within the grasp of many people.<br>
<p>
As I previously stated, if we didn't understand how a CPU (which we designed<br>
and constructed) worked, then software could not be deterministic in any<br>
useful sense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;It sounds like you are saying that it is impossible for</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;humans to truly understand anything.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, I admit that you know a lot, I know one or two things myself, I'm saying  </i><br>
<i>&gt;it is impossible for humans to truly understand everything.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  No *one* person can truly understand everything.  And human kind<br>
may never understand everything, but I will do my damnedest to come as close<br>
as I personally can.                  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;You can duplicate the binary computational sequence by</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                &gt;arranging and moving pebbles.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly true, and then nobody would understand pebbles.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                               </i><br>
You lost me here.  Pebbles are irrelevant to the computational structure.<br>
You could be using bananas and the results would be the same.  No one needs<br>
to understand the pebbles to perform the computation.  They would simply<br>
exist to solidify an abstraction (most people find visualization helpful).<br>
Computers are hardware implementations of abstract algorithms.  You could<br>
build an entire computer as a set of equations and predict every outcome<br>
from the computer for every set of conditions.  And this is actually how<br>
most CPUs are designed today anyway.  They are first built as abstracted<br>
simulations of equations before they are ever dedicated to hardware.  The<br>
reason we can do this is that computer computation is a simple,<br>
deterministic process.<br>
