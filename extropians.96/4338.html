<i>&gt;&gt; Sometimes one must fight evil ideas by being deliberately provocative</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and extreme in the other direction.  The unspeakable evil of the cult</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of self-sacrifice demands such a fight.  How can one possibly love</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; life without loving one's own most?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Very easily.  The only reason I'm still here is to serve humanity.</i><br>
<p>
If you really believe that is true, Eliezer, then you should take<br>
very good care of your body, develop your mind, and you should<br>
study the market to find out which skills are in the highest demand<br>
by the rest of humanity (hint: they will generally pay the best,<br>
because recent demand will have been growing faster than supply).<br>
In short, you should care about money and nothing else. It is only<br>
because I prefer myself and my friends to the vast mass of humanity<br>
that I care about anything other than money.  I know you probably<br>
know all this already, but I wanted to take the opportunity you<br>
gave me to explain a bit more about my current opinion that egoism<br>
and altruism collapse into one another.<br>
<p>
The best means of serving humanity is usually indistinguishable<br>
from what most people call selfishness. As for myself, I'm pretty<br>
selfish and only peripherally (if at all) interested in serving<br>
humanity, which is why I spend so much time studying what my<br>
interests dictate rather than studying the stuff that the market<br>
calls me to. Actually, I don't really believe that the best means<br>
of serving humanity is to make a lot of money; sometimes I think<br>
the best means of serving humanity is by setting a good example.<br>
And who would want to have to think about what kind of example they<br>
were setting every waking hour? Perhaps you would. Perhaps you<br>
really mean what you are saying. But if you would want to help<br>
others by setting a good example to them, then the example you<br>
should be setting should be one of selfishness. To set an example<br>
of "truly" altruistic self-sacrificing martyr-like behavior would<br>
*not* be of benefit to your followers!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And let's not forget that the religious/altruistic types you reflexively</i><br>
<i>&gt;condemn are simply stating a retrospectively obvious truth:  That our</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional nature, from self-righteousness to love to honor, has evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt;to maximize our own inclusive fitness, while an impartial ethical system</i><br>
<i>&gt;regards all sentients symmetrically.</i><br>
<p>
Exercise: explain why an impartial ethical system is preferable to a<br>
partial ethical system.<br>
<p>
P. S. Pay me no mind. I'm just a sophist.  ;)<br>
