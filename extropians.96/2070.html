<p>
First, note that I said "without *much* property".<br>
But also note that even slavery is never absolute.   Since slaves have<br>
information that slave-owners don't have, and since it is expensive to<br>
monitor every little thing a slave does, real slaves do have some<br>
autonomy that they can contract with.  <br>
<p>
Two slaves can, for example, agree to monitor each other's spouses,<br>
and to inform each other of any infidelity.  Even if their slave<br>
owner's ban this behavior, such a ban will be rather hard to enforce.<br>
Slaves can even agree to marry each other without their slave-owner's<br>
permission.  <br>
<p>
U.S. slave owners often gave their slaves their own plot of land to<br>
grow food on, allowing them to keep any extra proceeds.  Or they were<br>
allowed their own time to do their own housework, and could retain any<br>
proceeds from work they did on that time.  The added incentives with<br>
this approach were preferable, even if that meant that some slaves<br>
eventually were able to buy their own freedom.<br>
