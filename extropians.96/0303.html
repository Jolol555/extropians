<i>&gt; that impression! I'd appreciate any information about Stahlman -- his views,</i><br>
<i>&gt; his writings -- that could help me get a grip on his point of view.</i><br>
<p>
Those who remember the DigitaLiberty mailing list will recall Stahlman. I<br>
remember his writing to be flamboyant but generally incisive, consistently<br>
on the side of individual freedom. Bill Frezza was the ostensible "owner<br>
and operator" of the list, but I think Stahlman may have had co-status of<br>
some sort. AFAIK, there are no public archives of that list, although I<br>
and most likely others have private archives. The list went down a while<br>
back, flared up briefly and then vanished again. Just like Duncan Frissell<br>
and Sandy Sandfort's Privacy 101, all the good lists seem to just die out.<br>
(But Duncan and Sandy are still visibly active, at least, on cypherpunks;<br>
I haven't seen more than the occasional brief op-ed from Stahlman, and<br>
nothing from Frezza since (Information Week?) was carrying his column.<br>
