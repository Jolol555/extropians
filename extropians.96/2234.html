<i>&gt;I think that's a lot of what we're doing, as Extropians.  We are questioning </i><br>
<i>&gt;tradition.  We question the tradition of death, we question the tradition of </i><br>
<i>&gt;coercion, we question the tradition of ignorance and servility, we question </i><br>
<i>&gt;the traditional belief systems and paradigms, we question the tradition of </i><br>
<i>&gt;blind obedience to Authority, and we question all other entropic traditions.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;When we question these traditions, we find much about them that is </i><br>
<i>&gt;incompatible with our extropic goals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As Extropians, we prefer to find new, more effective ways to accomplish our </i><br>

<i>&gt;work well enough.</i><br>

_WOW_ this is one of the most catchy extropian memes I've heard yet and I<br>
will definately pass it around. Great thinking David! I live my life by this<br>
meme. It also sounds sorta x-file-ish akin to "The Truth is out there" which<br>
is pretty cool and will likely encourage it to spread through the<br>
population. I think we should consider now how we can spread this new meme<br>
and promote it! I _do_ hope this meme spreads like a plague through the<br>
populous.<br>
