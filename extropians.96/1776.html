In a message dated 96-10-10 19:38:58 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I have found these types of curves interesting as well, though I don't<br>
think<br>
 they are necessarily unextropian. I can envision a series of such curves in<br>
 succession. As the growth in one curve starts leveling off, new processes<br>
 (which I think can be viewed as extropian - BE, ST, IT ) take over and start<br>
 a new curve. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This in fact does happen with all microbial growth curves unless the<br>
microorganism is a has very stable genetic population and does not "gene<br>
switch" as _Candida albicans_ does (a yeast).  _Candida has at least six (6)<br>
gene switches it turned on of off depending of the environmental conditions.<br>
 So, I would hardly say a "yeast curve" was non-extropian.  <br>
<p>
Many (maybe all) bacteria, yeasts and mold also have two forms of<br>
reproduction, sexual and asexual.  This also accounts for the growth curves.<br>
  <br>
<p>
I discovered a new heat resistant mold my favorite growth curves are the heat<br>
resistant bacteria and mold curves.  They are different than classic growth<br>
curves.  If you try to count the number of viable cells in a population at<br>
time zero. Then heat shock the cells (this kills the non-heat resistant<br>
cells) and count the population again. . . with _Bacillus_ the counts go UP<br>
not down.  Some cells were viable but not countable (not culturable) before<br>
the heat shock.<br>
<p>
This is because some cells are shocked into growing and because some cells<br>
are less heat resistant (and die), while others start growing faster (than<br>
the weaker cells), thus giving a net INCREASE in count.  Again,  the growth<br>
curve is affected by a non-homogeneous population. <br>
<p>
This is why I don't get too worried by people pointing out the limits to<br>
growth via growth curves.  Life is not homogeneous, there is always an option<br>
in the genetic pool and in our case the technological pool too.  We have<br>
evolving tools as well as biological systems.  <br>
<p>
You (Douglas Houts)  are correct when you say the growth curves tend to<br>
"step".  Adaptation can take place any time, lag, log, stationary, or (yes<br>
even) decline.   If adaptation to a stress is seen in the decline phase it is<br>
called the "Phoenix Phemomenon".  This is will know to me since my research<br>
is in cell injury and repair mechanisms and preservation systems for food,<br>
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.<br>
<p>
The "stepping" is seen better in the log phase with several log-lags stepping<br>
upward and upward as the weaker cells die and the adapted or gene-switched<br>
cells out grow the previous population.  <br>
<p>
The cells start in lag phase (no net growth, equally  numbers live as die)<br>
 then a log phase starts but soon reached what is normally seen as a<br>
stationary phase.  BUT it's not really stationary!  It's another lag phase!<br>
 Then a second log phase started again.  This is how I see humans lag-log<br>
then stationary until trans-humans lag-log and post-humans lag-log then who<br>
knows what will happen?  And, I'm not just talking about biologic population<br>
numbers (more is not better if quality of life is poor),  I'm talking about<br>
technology "stepping" evolution too.<br>
<p>
When you consider biofilms (colonies of several kinds) of microorganism, the<br>
growth curve does not even apply because the single cells (bacteria, yeasts<br>
and molds) function as a multicellular organism just like we do.  <br>
<p>
Pure cultures are a figment of a microbiologist's imagination.  Pure cultures<br>
don't happen in nature (or are extremely rare and don't stay pure for long). <br>
