I'm clarifying a few points, and then I'm off this thread, and <br>
possibly off this list.  I cannot take the nastiness of the tone <br>
around here much longer.  It's sad, because I thought I might be <br>
extropian--I guess that isn't the case.<br>
<p>
1.	Using the phrase "I mean no offense" does <br>
not excuse making aspirsions on the intellect of persons <br>
participating on any list.<br>
<p>
2.	Despite intimations to the contrary, my questioning of Churchill's <br>
metaphor was "well thought out".  I have extensive rhetorical <br>
training and several editorships and have been trained to spot <br>
inconsistency.<br>
<p>
3.	I never said that Churchill wasn't intelligent, only that he <br>
preferred scholarly pursuits to climbing mountains looking for eagles <br>
(the basis for my knowledge).<br>
<p>
4.	I could quote at least five postings that have made negative <br>
comments about newcomers to this list, but why bother?  They're in <br>
the archives.<br>
