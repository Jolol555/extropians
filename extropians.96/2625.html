I can quite agree. I worked for the City of Redondo Beach in the<br>
Information Systems Division when I was 15. Not only is the public treated<br>
inhumanly but at my city, employees weren't treated humanly either and<br>
there was a strict militaristic feeling to the whole bit. Not positive at<br>
all. It was actually a relief when they layed me off due to my inability to<br>
juggle high school and a job because I was only able to work for 3 hrs a<br>
day. The stress was unbearable for someone that age and they wanted the<br>
whole thing run with zero failure or they'd call me up to the carpet and<br>
get lectured. This has unfortunetly poisened my idea of what jobs are like<br>
and I haven't been employed since then (I'm only 18) and it makes me<br>
apprehensive about getting a job soon. Most jobs treat you like a person<br>
don't they?<br>
