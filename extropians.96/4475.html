<i>&gt;&gt;I found this an interesting experience. It seemed that by the end of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;class (we discussed uploading late on the second day) most of the students</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;were open to the possibility of uploading a human mind into a machine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you think that the progression of topics provided the key to this </i><br>
<i>&gt;achievement of understanding, or were there other factors involved?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I think the progression of explanation helped a great deal. I gave them<br>
a grounding in the science first, then covered various philosophical ideas<br>
that make sense of the idea of mind as brain function before introducing the<br>
stranger ideas of uploading. Also, I forshadowed that discussion by<br>
mentioning the work on synthetic neurons. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Considering that many of the students are Catholic, that was surprising.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Given that Catholic theology (i) maintains a division between </i><br>
<i>&gt;body and soul, (ii) has strong mystical/cabalistic roots and (iii) </i><br>
<i>&gt;accepts the idea of the soul moving to other spaces, Catholics can </i><br>
<i>&gt;actually access the idea of uploading more readily than some other </i><br>
<i>&gt;religions.  Now, if only the Pope would issue an Encyclical endorsing </i><br>
<i>&gt;the concept!</i><br>
<p>
Taken at face value, the dualistic beliefs held by Catholics usually present<br>
a barrier to acceptance of the functionalist view that underlies the<br>
possibility of synthetic neurons and uploading. However, given most humans<br>
delight in holding incompatible ideas so long as they seem to resemble one<br>
another in some way, functionalism can (given a proper explanation) sneak in<br>
and exchange places with substance dualism.<br>
<p>
For Christian Resurrectionist the uploading idea is even easier.<br>
Resurrectionists believe that when we die we stay in the ground. We do not<br>
float up to heaven in nonphysical bodies. Instead, we stay buried until the<br>
Second Coming then we are raised up in our restored *physical* bodies. This<br>
is compatible with materialism. (Except for God, of course.) <br>
<p>
Even if Resurrectionism were true, I'd stick with cryonics since I'd expect<br>
to be back up and running sooner -- the Second Coming has been a long time<br>
in coming. Apparently it takes Jesus a long time to recover after his first<br>
divine orgasm. :)<br>
