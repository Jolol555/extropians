Actually, I think dynamic optimism is not all that new.  It is Dale<br>
Carnegie.  It is "est".  It is Carlos Casteneda.  But most of all, it is<br>
common sense.<br>
<p>
The question of whether it is learned or genetic is an interesting one.<br>
<p>
I believe it is learned, but not the same way you learn Japanese or calculus.<br>
<p>
To really understand dynamic optimism requires a high degree of<br>
receptivity.  In my experience, most people are only receptive to such<br>
ideas for brief periods during their lives.<br>
<p>
Although est was a cult, it did offer a grain of truth.  To "get it," you<br>
had to be willing to reexamine your entire perspective and approach to<br>
life.  At least as far as personal relationships go, much skepticism is due<br>
to constant replaying in your mind of a video tape containing past,<br>
negative experiences.<br>
<p>
I don't think dynamic optimism = blind optimism, however.  And I can't<br>
prove it is not a religion.  But I don't see that it matters.<br>
<p>
The key lesson is that life continually presents positive opportunities.<br>
Most people miss those opportunities because they err on the side of<br>
skepticism.<br>
