I don't know why they won't survive, either, but that's because I happen to<br>

This is why I used asterisks when I said "long term". If we become a<br>
cultural monocrop in the next century, I don't expect that we'll get well<br>
past that condition until after the diaspora reaches its interstellar<br>
stages. Geographic (well, cosmographic) separation leads to clading.<br>
There's been talk of cosmic wormholes and "empires", but if a wormhole can<br>
be created, it can be destroyed. Emigrants can close the doors behind them.<br>
Hence, in the *long* term, we'll see clading and differentiation again,<br>
sooner or later. Colonies will carry culture with them, but after a century<br>
or two, the culture in the colonies of the Coal Sack region is not going to<br>
look much like the culture in the colonies of the Ursa Major group.<br>
<p>
And it's entirely possible that means of differentiation will be found that<br>
can be used even within the narrow confines of the Solar System. Once you<br>
take your stuff out of the ecliptic plane, it's pretty darn inaccessible<br>
(or at least expensive to get to), thanks to the delta-vees.<br>
