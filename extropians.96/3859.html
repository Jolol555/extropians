<p>
You can find your own examples, Lyle. My motive was to challenge<br>
the reprehensible assertion you made about my character. I have no<br>
interest in publicly furthering your education.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In any case, I am much more of a humanities person than a math </i><br>

<p>
Anyone competent in the humanities would not be posing an honest<br>
question about the causality of rhetoric as if it were some simple<br>
mechanical process like convection or radiation. The causality of<br>
rhetoric is precisely what the humanities study. But I forgot...<br>
you weren't posing an honest question: you were "driving at<br>
something".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, a pattern seems to be developing, in which I write a private </i><br>
<i>&gt;message which hurts your feelings, and the next day you make a </i><br>
<i>&gt;comment on the list about my having no sense of humor, or not </i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding rhetoric -- comments which are at most tangentially </i><br>

<p>
No, Lyle, I hurt your feelings by publicly impugning your sense of<br>
humor and your understanding of rhetoric. It's obvious that you're<br>
quite proud of both. But you needn't be such a crybaby about it<br>
just because some college-dropout Unix geek says you lack both these<br>
treasures.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry that this "pattern" is developing, but I'm afraid the<br>
only place where the pattern is developing is within the confines<br>
of your skull. When was the last time you were screened for a<br>
paranoia-inducing chemical imbalance, Lyle? If that's not the cause<br>
of your delusions, then I can only imagine that you're trying to<br>
entrap me in another one of your little self-fulfilling prophecies.<br>
I'm not buying.<br>
<p>
Gaming with you is fun, Lyle. But unlike you, I have some respect for<br>
the time and resources of the other people who read this list. Gaming<br>
with you is something I do in private, and for you to simultaneously <br>
try to take that game public *and* accuse me of doing the deed for<br>
you just makes you look the fool. Haven't you noticed that many people<br>
on the list are already automatically discounting everything you say?<br>
Why do you bother? Perhaps it is time for you to bring your little<br>
experiment to an end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Slave boys get no apologies.</i><br>
<p>
It's nice to see you enhancing your reputation as an insulting bastard,<br>
Lyle. I'm sure such a reputation will get you far.<br>
