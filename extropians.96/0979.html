[ ACF stands for Automated Collaborative Filtering if you forgot]<br>
<p>
The September issue of Wired carried an article by<br>
famous-as-a-visionary John Perry Barlow, entitled<br>
"The Powers That Were". <br>
<p>
 JPB calls US democracy "Government by Hallucinating Mob,<br>
driven mad by television", explaining that much of the<br>
knowledge about current social issues is available to the<br>
public via advertisement-sponsored TV (and other mass media)<br>
that selects both content and presentation with the goal to<br>
keep the audience near their TV sets, so that they can see<br>
more ads and make more money for advertisers and media owners.<br>
As the result, juicy/silly non-issues manufactured for<br>
keeping the lowest common denominator bottom glued to the<br>
couch, steal public attention from real serious problems -<br>
and then the populace elects its representatives to "handle"<br>
these TV-induced collective hallucinations.<br>
<p>
  JPB suggests some observations on how U.S. got into this<br>
pitiful state, and ideas on how the Cyberspace can help<br>
restructure social knowledge-delivery and decision-making<br>
mechanisms.   He does not mention ACF - though, in my opinion,<br>
ACF has the potential of playing a very significant role in<br>
intelligent demassifying and fine-tuning of the architecture<br>
of social conversation.<br>
<p>
  Now, the question is, will the ACF developers steer their<br>
technology towards commercial goals, trying to develop<br>
"personalized glues" to paste each individual bottom to its<br>
couch, and deliver whatever-pleases-you-personally to keep<br>
you in front of the screen even longer and see more - and<br>
better targeted - ads  than TV ever could - and make still<br>
more money?  Or will ACF system development be based on an<br>
effort to leverage the potential of the technology for<br>
intentional social engineering?<br>
<p>
  My expectation is that this will be business-as-usual:<br>
efforts will be made to make money, but the resulting<br>
technology will have some social-restructuring side-effects.<br>
The cultural consequences should be somewhat beneficial - this<br>
time.  We just seem to be lucky to live in the technological<br>
period when the irresponsible-as-usual development happens<br>
to bring positive results. It started recently and may end<br>
well within our lifetimes.  Maybe, by that time we'll learn<br>
to rely more on vision than on luck.   Maybe, not.<br>
