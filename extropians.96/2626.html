<i>&gt;In that case, I'd swiftly get used to the notion that it was just</i><br>
<i>&gt;like dropping off to sleep on the jet and waking up in another town.  Of</i><br>
<i>&gt;course, I could be *fooled* into believing that this were the case, even if</i><br>
<i>&gt;a destructive-uploading expert knew it wasn't, which would soothe my dread.</i><br>
<i>&gt;`Just step into the nice warm shower, Damien...'  But I'd rather not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;deceived in that way.</i><br>

Uhh! Upload Holocaust! Scary. I wonder how the teleport tech works in Star<br>
Trek. Nano, accelerated particles, or upload clones? Remember the episode<br>
where they teleport Riker off a ship and the teleporter malfunctions and<br>
they have a clone that remained on that ship for like 20 years? Or the<br>
episode where that guy was afraid to go into the teleporters because he was<br>
afraid his consciousness would cease to exist? Perhaps we're seeing a<br>
million clones of Riker, and Picard!<br>
