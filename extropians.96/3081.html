<p>
That is beacuse you suffer from the hubris that you are already smart<br>
enough to be treated like the equal of a hyperbeing, and you want your<br>
supper NOW DAMMIT.  That sounds like a spoiled child talking.<br>
<p>
I'm no saint but I couldn't sleep at night if I<br>
<i>&gt; knew that generations of conscious beings were suffering horribly in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; laboratory.</i><br>
<p>
But any experimental scientist working with animals like dolphins knows<br>
that the experiments they put their charges in to test them for<br>
intelligence, and teach them communication, or try to learnin their<br>
communication, will neccessarily impose sever hardship on the individual<br>
animals involved.  If another species wishes to cease to be treated like<br>
animals, they are going to have to demonstrate intelligent traits.<br>
<p>
It's sad, but true.  If we are to be treated with equality by any<br>
hypothetical hyperbeings, we must demonstrate to them that we are<br>
deserving of that treatment, otherwize, we are merely smart animals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;It [God] would also be omniscient within that simulation, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;it would neccessarily have a complete understanding of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;entire workings of that simulation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "God" would know the basic laws of physics in the world created by His</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, but that does NOT mean He "would necessarily have a complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding of the entire workings of that simulation".  In the cellular</i><br>
<i>&gt; automation universe of the "Game of Life" the physics is very simple yet it</i><br>
<i>&gt; creates extraordinary patterns of great complexity, and the only way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; figure out what it will do next is to run it and see. You can learn the</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics (rules) of Chess in a few minutes, and spend a lifetime learning just</i><br>
<i>&gt; some of its  ramifications.</i><br>
<p>
True, but that is using your human mind. We are talking about<br>
hypothetical hyper-beings.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The anthropomorphic answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; that  the universe must exist or we wouldn't be here to ask the question,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is true but just begs the question, why are we here? </i><br>
<p>
No reason at all.....  unless we give ourselves one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any answer in the form</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the universe  exists because of X " will never satisfy us because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately suggests another very obvious unanswered  question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only halfway adequate way to explain it is if it could be shown that</i><br>
<i>&gt; "nothing" was somehow self contradictory so there must be "something".</i><br>
<p>
THis is just another way to describe the anthropic principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I love logic, I think its useful in solving all problems, except this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know if the question even makes sense. The first word of this question</i><br>
<i>&gt; is "why" which means " what is the reason". Reason implies logic and logic is</i><br>
<i>&gt; something. So we are asked to find a logical reason for reality, but clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; we can't use logic to find it, after all, that would  be illogical. This sort</i><br>
<i>&gt; of thing could give circular reasoning a bad name  because it's totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; without  meaning.</i><br>
<p>
The most important realization one can make is that the universe IS<br>
meaningless. It is we who are meaning making machines.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or is it?  All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those</i><br>
<i>&gt; words also have  definitions made of other words also in  the dictionary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and round and round we go. Is a  dictionary totally without meaning?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose that  all depends on what meaning means.</i><br>
<p>
Words mean what you say they mean........<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Preconceptions about words do burden me. When I use a familiar word in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfamiliar way, I at least try to make that new meaning clear.  That's not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; say that ambiguity and unusual uses of words don't have a place, but it's in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Poetry not Science.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, in pop culture, words are given new meaning by the "cool"<br>
crowd, and it is left to everyone else to figure out what they mean.<br>
Once they do, it's no longer a "cool" word, but it is an indicator that<br>
one's memes are being accepted by the mainstream. maybe redefining<br>
common words to our own use will help in the meme spreading of &gt;H,<br>
extropianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, when I use the word "computer" it is divorced from its original meaning,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but not from its common meaning. My use of the word rarely causes confusion</i><br>
<i>&gt; because I did not make up a new meaning out of thin air. On the other hand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if I said I went to Burger King, bought a computer, put some ketchup on it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then ate it, people might be puzzled.</i><br>
<p>
If I said I went to a deli and had a submarine for lunch, would you<br>
flinch?  Words have the meaning we give them. They are nothing without<br>
us...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Creating a new  definition for God should be an easy step..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, very easy, far, far, too easy. There are so many they have lost all</i><br>
<i>&gt; value.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
But John, if you are an atheist, then the word "God" should have no<br>
meaning to you.<br>
