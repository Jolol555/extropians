        Sure.  Why not?  The problem a lot of extropians (and indeed, people<br>
in general) seem to stumble upon is the prescence of 'infinite<br>
possibilities'.  The fact that *anything* is feasible is both a good thing<br>
and a bad thing;  good, in that there is always further to go and more to<br>
know, but bad in the sheer enormousity of the concept.  What people have a<br>
tendency to do is worry about certain 'abstract' possibilities such as the<br>
unforeseen or unavoidable cataclysms.  Sure, it's possible that a huge<br>
asteroid will crash into the earth, sending both rocks reeling into the sun.<br>
So much for human progress then.  Just like earthly disasters such as<br>
Pompeii or Atlantis.  *But*, if we all spent time worrying about all the<br>
tragic possibilites, we would be no wiser than the doomsayers on the corner<br>
of the street.  <br>
<p>
        A state of invincibility *is certainly possible*.  The biggest<br>
problem facing our rise to this level is our current vulnerability.  The<br>
prospect of immortality is hindered by the so-called 'accident curb'.  The<br>
current prediction is that if we surpass our biological worries, within 400<br>
years we'll be knocked off by some sort of accident.  That doesn't mean I'm<br>
going to stop striving for immortality and invincibility.  If I die on<br>
accord of some accident in a few hundred years, then there is not much I can<br>
do about it.  If it is truly an accident, it will probably be unforeseen.  I<br>
can't spend my time worrying about the unforeseen or unavoidable, I'd rather<br>
focus on making the tragic possibilities more *avoidable*.<br>
<p>
        In essence, I don't believe that there is a point of no return.<br>
Where one person falls (if he truly must), I hope there will be another<br>
person there to try to make up for it; but of course, I don't think any<br>
person will have to fall...I'm optimistic, but also realistic.<br>
