Ah yes, Hal is truly one of the Old Ones! I believe the List started in<br>
August of 1991.<br>

<p>
I'd say governments are the result of a kind of SO, but they are not<br>
examples *of* SO. Spontaneously ordering processes can produce results that<br>
themselves are inimical to spontaneous order.<br>
<p>
Actually, if spontaneous order is to have any meaning, we have to restrict<br>
the processes that we characterize that way. It's not obvious to me that the<br>
random circumstances, deliberate brutalities and dominations, false beliefs,<br>
etc. that led to powerful governments, constitute an example of a<br>
spontaneously ordering process. What are the principles or rules that govern<br>
that ordering? In a market SO it's the private property rights and price<br>
signals that make up the SO. I'm not sure what it would be in the case of<br>
the development of governments.<br>
<p>
Let's see those early postings Hal!<br>
<p>
The August 17 Freeland Party can be a Extropians List 5th birthday party as<br>
well as an Extropy magazine 8th birthday party!<br>
