<i>&gt;A few weeks ago, I came up with this idea for a new technique I like to</i><br>

<i>&gt;telling the user the original location like a proxy. This way you could put</i><br>
<i>&gt;a CGI script on your website with links to country-specific censored texts</i><br>
<i>&gt;or webpages and not tell anyone the site locations so that they can't shut</i><br>
<i>&gt;them down. A person could put up a so-called subversive webpage in that</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific country and tell this proxy the address and thus protect the site</i><br>
<i>&gt;without giving out it's real address forcing the ISPs in that country to</i><br>
<i>&gt;scan ALL WEBPAGES on their servers making the process more difficult. You</i><br>
<i>&gt;could put up any so-called subversive and censored information on your</i><br>
<i>&gt;webpage and people could access them without getting shutdown because only</i><br>
<i>&gt;the CGI script would know where the source site is and you could even</i><br>
<i>&gt;cipher the script's site list so even the owner of the proxy website can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;locate the sites. You could then have a website or even a web search tool</i><br>
<i>&gt;where you'd load all these sites into and acquire even more sites because</i><br>
<i>&gt;you'd be offering protection and the sites would stay up indefinately. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;the FEDS get pissed, simply wipe the file and the list is gone but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sites remain. </i><br>
<p>
This should be easy to do.  I will see if I can throw something together in<br>
a few days if I have time and get back to everyone on this.  <br>
<p>
Shouldn't be a problem.<br>
