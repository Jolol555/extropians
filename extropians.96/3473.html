<i>&gt; What we need to do is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create ignition, heat up the idea by spreading it until the point that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; burns the fuel rapidly into a gigantic wildfire out of control. In this way</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is also alot like creating the first controlled fusion reaction where</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ignition is the difficult part because variables need to be *perfect*</i><br>
<i>&gt; and continueing the reaction is the easy part. All you need is a spark to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignite a raging brushfire. Lets ignite that fire </i><br>
<i>&gt; by selecting the people who would be most effective at spreading the memes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; contacting them and add them to the collective of the group. (No BORG jokes)</i><br>
<p>
If I may make a suggestion?  Start a new thread called "Extropian Form<br>
Letter", devoted to building an outline for an article/letter/pamphlet<br>
that would introduce the untutored to the Singularity.  I believe that<br>
the Singularity meme would spread faster than the Extropian culture<br>
because it's smaller, slimmer, less vulnerable, easier to remember and<br>
easier to grasp, plus it's all you need to know to start looking into<br>
the future.<br>
<p>
Remember, this is an outline for an *introduction*, not an<br>
*explanation*.<br>
<p>
I'm requesting an outline on the theory that any individual Extropian<br>
can implement it as an article or whatever, thus allowing it to be<br>
published in multiple locations with multiple spins.  Also, I can't do<br>
outlines by myself for cognitive reasons; all I can do is craft a lot of<br>
paragraphs and hope they're in the right order.  My feeble take on V.1,<br>
from an article I was working on:<br>
<p>
Title:  "History Ends In 2025, If We're Smart Enough."<br>
Reasons:  Introduce "End of History" to grab attention, "2025" to<br>
emphasize immediate importance, "If We're Smart Enough" to dissociate<br>
from tired doomsday memes (Greenhouse Effect) and religious/apocalyptic<br>
memes that would only appeal to groups of a particular faith.<br>
<p>
1.  Computers double in power every two subjective years.<br>
2.  Recursive intelligence amplification.<br>
3.  Defines "Singularity."<br>
4.  Is this a good thing?  Names factions.<br>
5.  Doomsday faction.<br>
6.  Uploading faction.<br>
7.  Intro to nanotechnology.<br>
8.  Nearness of nanotechnology.<br>
9.  Nanotechnology replaces economy.<br>
10. Gray goo problem.<br>
11. Intelligence amplification.<br>
12. Runaway positive feedback of IA.<br>
13. Replacement of human society: End of History.<br>
14. Singularity provides Interim Meaning of Life.<br>
15. Summary: History is about to end.<br>
<p>
Let us discuss the following issues:<br>
1.  What material needs to be included in an introduction?<br>
2.  In what order should that material be presented?<br>
3.  How should that material be conveyed?  (Examples, digressions into<br>
    specific paths, theoretical explanations...)<br>
4.  What objections *must* be countered?<br>
5.  What is being left out of this list?<br>
