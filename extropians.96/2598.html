Of course not. But this is an operational question posed from *outside* the<br>
skin of the two would-be uploaders.  An important issue unresolved by this<br>
`Turing test' question remains, as I posed it earlier: would one be prepared<br>
to die (sacrific one's current instantiation) in order that an exact copy of<br>
oneself be reconstituted elsewhere, or on a different substrate?  To insist<br>
upon this question is not to be a hostile `upload skeptic', at least not in<br>
the sense that the philosopher John Searle might be, denying that a<br>
consciousness could ever be instantiated on a computer system.  <br>
<p>
Greg Egan's fiction, which I keep blathering admiringly about, plays with<br>
these questions in a series of skin-crawling gedanken experiments.  His<br>
favoured mode of upload/duplication/extended non-carbon life is a growing<br>
`crystal' that is implanted in the brain, and echoes (in effective, mirrors<br>
or redundantly and passively stores) every brain state from then on: `learns<br>
to be me'.  It's a bit like the two cerebral hemispheres, to the extent<br>
(whatever that extent is) that those are not complementary but redundant<br>
backups.  Eventually, when your consciousness is running on a joint system,<br>
neural net perfectly echoed by the crystal, your meaty brain is scooped out.<br>
This, to the unprejudiced, is no cause for alarm.  Had the mirroring been<br>
done at a distance, onto a human-capable machine via radio, the same<br>
situation would obtain.  <br>
<p>
Well, what if all twins were perfectly telepathic... but that doesn't quite<br>
work, because they are differently situated *as visible actors* in space,<br>
and the loss of one body would surely devastate the other locus of their<br>
shared consciousness.  <br>
<p>
What if everyone were *given* a cloned double, with whose brain-states he or<br>
she became redundantly resonant...  No, it's hard to retain empathy for the<br>
subjects of these thought games.  Vinge's 101 dalmations in space, in A FIRE<br>
UPON THE DEEP, goes some way toward exploring the experience of a<br>
disseminated consciousness some of whose modules die and get replaced by<br>
variant plug-ins (ie different doggies entirely).<br>
<p>
Bottom line: physical continuity and general brain-process continuity<br>
jointly create our sense of continuing identity and allow us to believe that<br>
the person who wakes up tomorrow is the same one who went to sleep tonight<br>
(or in 10 years after a coma, but nobody denies that this case is deeply<br>
traumatic; or after half the brain is removed due to cancer, and no one<br>
denies that this case is even more deeply troubling).  Even if *I* can't<br>
tell the difference between you and your perfect clone, *you* surely can, as<br>
they strip you down.  Check out Algis Budrys's classic 1960 sf novel about<br>
matter transmission, ROGUE MOON, where there's a copy at each end, or James<br>
Kelly's much discussed recent story `Think Like a Dinosaur' (I believe it's<br>
called) where aliens with matter transmission tech impose a requirement that<br>
the person left behind must be killed when the double is materialised at the<br>
far end.  I'd go kicking and screaming... not at all reconciled by the<br>
simultaneous existence of my double in the receiving pod - *unless* I<br>
remained, throughout, in perfect non-local continuous connection/identity<br>
with him.  In that case, I'd swiftly get used to the notion that it was just<br>
like dropping off to sleep on the jet and waking up in another town.  Of<br>
course, I could be *fooled* into believing that this were the case, even if<br>
a destructive-uploading expert knew it wasn't, which would soothe my dread.<br>
`Just step into the nice warm shower, Damien...'  But I'd rather not be<br>
deceived in that way.<br>
