<p>
Like so many other bands... Attention has always focussed on Kraftwerk,<br>
because it's the band that got known. You rarely hear about Cluster, Can,<br>
Ashra Temple, Logic system etc, etc ...<br>

trivial detail:<br>
Wasn't she still called Walter Carlos when he/she made this ? <br>

<i>&gt;Base to be quality music anyway (from a musical standpoint).</i><br>
<p>
In what way is it not 'quality' music ? It's produced well, it feels good,<br>
it works on a dancefloor and ...it sells well!. I have none of their<br>
records, as they are not 'my cup of tea', but i try to remain as open minded<br>
toward music as i try to be to things in general. What is musical ? I assume<br>
you are not refering to the purely technical musical when you define<br>
'quality' as your choice of other (techno) bands are not on a higher level<br>
(bands which by the way i find more pleasing than ace of base). So you view<br>
quality in experimentalism, much like me, many others have different ways of<br>
looking at it. In its style/genre, Ace of Base IS quality music, i'd like to<br>
hear anyone can deny that without involving their personal taste in music. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Eon</i><br>
another trivial detail:<br>
J saul Kane is back as Octagon Man these days, making 'new electro', (the<br>
music industry hasn't involved itself in the new style yet, so there's no<br>
'real' name for it yet), basically it's the latest split-off of techno<br>
combining new sounds with 'retro eighties' (disco, electro, ebm, industrial)<br>
rhythms and structures. Those of you who don't follow the music closely,<br>
will hear more about it in say ...four years or so. :-(  ,As the music<br>
industries first attempts to 'launch' it, failed last year, and they seem to<br>
have lost interest for now. (wrong choice of name: 'electro' was not 'new'<br>
and hype enough)<br>

It's also amazing how many people make hits with only an amiga... Ofcourse<br>
they won't tell the press, they'll just say they build their own synths or<br>
something...<br>

<p>
maybe i just experienced kraftwerks lyrics as 'negative' (i love their<br>
music), or maybe it's due to the fact that the first tiem i heared them, i<br>
heared it in german (there are slight differences in the lyrics). Anyway try<br>
these two (i've forwarded them to max m rasmussen as a preview of the list<br>
i'm working on) and note the difference:<br>
<p>
1) Quark - the attraction of technology, the black hole of the thumbscrewed<br>
exoskeleton. (hpf records 15, belgium) by Matthew Buggins, UK 1993? <br>
<p>
2) Autonation - cyborg society<br>
(cue records uk) by chris beeton and dave campbell 1991 Uk <br>

<p>
I was inspired by Anne clark a lot, even though what she implied in her<br>
lyrics as negative, i felt attracted to in a positive way. maybe that's how<br>
it worked with kraftwerk as well, maybe there just wasn't anything (even)<br>
more transhuman around... so this was what we had to do with...<br>
<p>
<p>
to conlcude:<br>
I am still sure that there are many more examples of music out there that<br>
connect to our memes on a much more specific or positive level. I'm also<br>
quite sure that most of those won't reach a wide audience unless ofcourse we<br>
make an effort to help them...<br>
<p>
If any of you extropians/transhumans in the music business have given some<br>
thought to the idea of releasing a compilation of some sorts that deals with<br>
these memes, i'm sure that this newsgroup can provide you with lists of<br>
artists and maybe tapes to choose from. I think we've seen an example of<br>
that already. Maybe i'll do it myself in a few years, who knows...<br>
