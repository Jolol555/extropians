<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; cautious about this.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you don't mind my asking, what is your present weight?  Was</i><br>
<i>&gt;your pre-creatine weight a recent plateau, or had you been gaining</i><br>
<i>&gt;weight steadily?</i><br>
<p>
Present weight is at 114.  My weight was at a stand-still of 102 for several<br>
years.  Then, when I started adding more muscle, it went to 108 - 111 and<br>
has remained between these few pound fluctuation (pending on female cycle,<br>
etc.). After starting to take the creatine, I put on the four pounds and it<br>
has remained fairly constant (per female cycle plus or minus ounces).  I<br>
have had a very difficult time putting on weight, regardless of my physical<br>
excercise type.  Because I am an athlete, I have needed to keep a solid<br>
weight (without fat.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The downside, for me as an example, is that I get a stomach ache after</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; taking the creatine.  This could be because I usually take it on an empty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stomach, and because I don't like the taste of it, I mix it with cranberry</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; juice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another friend of mine uses white grape juice.  Isn't cranberry juice</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather acid?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and certainly adds to the tummy ache.  I plan to be more careful in the<br>
future about putting something in my stomach to absorb the acid.  I might<br>
try your friend's grape juice.<br>
