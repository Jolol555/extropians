I'll just concede your conspiracy theory at the outset, even though I don't<br>
agree with it.<br>
<p>
Surely the members of the conspiracy are capable of studying economics and<br>
social epistemology and figuring out that free societies are vastly more<br>
productive than slave societies. For their own selfish ends, the members of<br>
the conspiracy would be better served by changing their ways than they<br>
would be by attempting to enslave the planet. The unknown and unpredictable<br>
results of research proceeding on a million different fronts at once is far<br>
more likely to guarantee the members of the governing elite personal<br>
immortality and vast wealth than a mass enslavement project would be.<br>
<p>
And even if the governing elite is too lazy and stupid to study economics<br>
and social epistemology, surely they make a practice of hiring expert<br>
researchers, and some of the researchers they hire are informing them of<br>
these facts.<br>
<p>
In short, to hold up your argument, you need to show that it is in the<br>
interests of the governing elite to enslave the population of the world.<br>
Clearly, this course of action is *not* in their own best interest, though<br>
I'd have to dig up a lot of Popper and Hayek to support my contention.<br>
