<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi David:</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;                 &gt;prescription for paranoid encryption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Power exists in society (fortunately, I'd hate to live in a powerless</i><br>
<i>&gt; world)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and like matter, energy, information, and everything else in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; it is not distributed evenly; after all, we've known for more than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; century</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that the aether does not exist. Raging against power centers is like</i><br>
<i>&gt; raging</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; against electromagnetism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;                  &gt;Bullshit.  Kazynski would use PGP if he could.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As would be his right until the moment he actually commits a crime that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; violates another's individual rights. Guns don't kill people, people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kill people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How come then that you in the states have twice the amount of gunshot</i><br>
<i>&gt; killings, then we do here in Denmark where privately owned guns are</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Sure killing with a gun in hand is easier for a person. However you are<br>
not considering the significant differences in the way criminals are<br>
treated in our two countries. Our country puts them in jail for a few<br>
years where they either rape or get raped on a constant basis, are never<br>
taught any usefull skills, and are never given any psychological help.<br>
They are turned loose into a society that has ZERO rehab systems in<br>
place, etc etc etc.<br>
<p>
Additionally, countries like Denmark are made up of people who<br>
historically have been so satisfied with the feudal, then socialistic<br>
governments controlling them that they never thought much about being<br>
ticked off enough to be criminals. The misfits all got shipped here,<br>
where they breed more misfits. In fuedal systems, it was commonly<br>
accepted that the common people have no right to bear arms, that that<br>
right solely belongs to the aristocracy in arms.<br>
<p>
Show me one case where a gun killed someone all by itself and I'll<br>
concede the argument. (sorry, I've argued this one so many times, its<br>
easy to win)<br>
<p>
It also may be argued that the US is engaged in a low intensity civil<br>
war against its citizens on several fronts, so is not to be compared to<br>
countries in a current state of peace. The fronts include producers,<br>
users and consumers of various substances the feds have determined<br>
citizens are not responsible enough to handle themselves, as well as a<br>
large sector of the African AMerican community, and a large part of the<br>
rural citizenry who are fed up with the federal governments abrogation<br>
of the Constitution. If individuals did not have the right to bear arms,<br>
they would be victimized by those forces vying for power.<br>
<p>
It is also known that 90% of the gun related violence occuring in the US<br>
is committed with illegally obtained guns (except for that commited by<br>
the government against its citizens), so the last vestiges of your<br>
argument are blown away. If we had no illegal gun associated violence,<br>
our murder rate would be 1/5 of yours, and similarly, if we banned guns,<br>
we would only drop the gun related murder rate by 10%, so the legality<br>
of right to bear arms is of little impact on crime rates....<br>
