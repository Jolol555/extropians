I saw on TV recently where someone has altered a common cold virus to<br>
enter lung tissue and repair the genetic abnormality that causes some of<br>
these respiratory problems. Our memetic processes are taking over our<br>
genetic ones. Pretty soon your body will be what ever you want it to be.<br>
<p>
People who think that the natural (genetic) is better than the<br>
artificial (memetic) should be made aware that this idea is itself<br>
memetic. Since all standards of good/bad or beautiful/ugly are memetic,<br>
the "100% natural is good" meme is self-referential and contradictory.<br>
