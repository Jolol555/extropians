<i>&gt;           Dan Clemmensen has suggested that SIs don't colonise cosmos</i><br>
<i>&gt;           because of their high discount rate for future benefits. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;           discount rate would presumably be high because of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           rapidity of their subjective time and the slowness of cosmic</i><br>
<i>&gt;           travels. The idea is interesting since, if right, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;           help resolve the Fermi paradox.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;           One reason why SIs could have a high discount rate would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           if they had a bias towards the near future, just as we</i><br>
<i>&gt;           humans have. We tend to care more about an imminent pleasure</i><br>
<i>&gt;           than about a similar one we would sure to get in a billion</i><br>
<i>&gt;           years. Perhaps all SIs would be "irrational" in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;           way?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;           Another reason why an SI might discount the benefits of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           colonisation is because they would only come about if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;           diverted some of its resources to the space mission,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           resources which could have been used for other purposes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Suppose that the objective of the SI is to maximise the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           amount of valuable computations it will carry out during its</i><br>
<i>&gt;           life time. At a certain time t it has a given capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;           (consisting perhaps of its mass or available energy). Part</i><br>
<i>&gt;           of this capital could be invested into a project that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;           yield returns at t'&gt;t, but meanwhile that capital could not</i><br>
<i>&gt;           be used to make valuable computations, i.e. there would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           an opportunity cost which would have to be subtracted from</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the expected returns when considering whether the investment</i><br>
<i>&gt;           is worthwhile. The question is what the function</i><br>
<i>&gt;           f=valuablecomputationspower(capital) looks like. For</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Clemmensen's argument to go through, it would not suffice</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that f had a jerk at some point, because different SIs would</i><br>
<i>&gt;           presumably start out with somewhat different amounts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           capital. If all SI had originally a capital less that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           critical amount, then they would invest in space missions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           but the benefit of space missions seems to come in chunks</i><br>
<i>&gt;           (one chunk for every planet or solar system one arrived at),</i><br>
<i>&gt;           and so there would be some overshoot: most SIs would obtain</i><br>
<i>&gt;           a capital greater than the critical value, and they would</i><br>
<i>&gt;           have little to lose from using the excess for new space</i><br>
<i>&gt;           missions. f would rather have to have the shape of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;           inverted exponential, so that for each amount of capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;           (greater than some start-up value), a slight loss of capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;           would reduce the computation power greatly, whereas a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt;           increase would bring but a negligible increase. Not only</i><br>
<i>&gt;           would the function have to be of an exponential character,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the constants would have to be rather great, considering</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that the gains would be obtained after perhaps a thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt;           years and be enjoyed for perhaps billions of years, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the required investment would presumably be very small</i><br>
<i>&gt;           compared to the SI's total capital whereas the gains could</i><br>
<i>&gt;           be very substantial. For instance, if any considerable</i><br>
<i>&gt;           degree of parallelization of valuable computations were</i><br>
<i>&gt;           possible, then df/d(capital) would certainly not decrease</i><br>
<i>&gt;           rapidly enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;           If Robin's objection, that not all knowledge can be obtained</i><br>
<i>&gt;           simply by sitting back and think (making computations), is</i><br>
<i>&gt;           directed against Clemmensen's basic idea rather than against</i><br>
<i>&gt;           some other more specific claim Clemmensen has made, then I</i><br>
<i>&gt;           don't think it carries very much weight, because there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;           obvious reason why SIs should be interested in the detailed</i><br>
<i>&gt;           structure of distant cosmic regions. We must not forget that</i><br>
<i>&gt;           a mere suggestion for where the Great Filter could be, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;           if it falls short of being a proof, would be very helpful;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           in any case there seem to be much greater difficulties with</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Clemmensen's proposal than that it assumes that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           curiosity of SIs is rather limited.</i><br>

<p>
This is a good description of the the disscussion Robin and I are<br>
having. I'd like ot clarify a few points, however.<br>
<p>
1) I do not really believe SI's will act as I have described. I believe<br>
that<br>
SI's motivations are incomprehensible to us. I was, as you suggested,<br>
trying<br>
to examine one possible element of the "great filter". Your points deal<br>
with<br>
the liklihood that this element is important. The actual filter is the<br>
more general possibility that SIs will choose not to explore for a<br>
reason that<br>
is generis to the condition of being an SI. The "computational discount<br>
rate" was<br>
intended only as an example.<br>
<p>
More later. I have to go do a kid taxi run.<br>
