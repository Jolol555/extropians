Ian Goddard backtracks -- <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been informed by Life Extension Foundation </i><br>
<i>&gt; Political Coordinator John Hammell that the article </i><br>
<i>&gt; contains serious inaccuracies.   </i><br>
<p>
Nevertheless it remains true that the FDA has been trying to restrict <br>
our access to vitamins for a long time, and shows no sign of giving up <br>
on this.  Meanwhile, other things such as pot and steroids are illegal, <br>
and this situation seems unlikely to change.  <br>
<p>
The questions remain:  how did this situation come about, and is there <br>
any way we can get leverage on it?  <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;     The pharmaceutical Corporations, were unable to control Congress </i><br>
<i>&gt; which recently responded to public pressure and allowed freedom in </i><br>
<i>&gt; food supplements.  However, they are not so easily defeated </i><br>
<i>&gt; in their quest to reap cartel style profits based on "reguations".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      So, they are going to the World Government institutions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumvent our rights...</i><br>
<p>
This seems unlikely to me.  Pharmaceutical companies can sell <br>
vitamins at a profit like any other product.  I read somewhere that most <br>
vitamins are made by pharmaceutical companies, usually Hoffman-<br>
LaRouche, and then repackaged under various labels.  (If the vitamins <br>
are supposed to be organic, they just mix in some floor sweepings <br>
so the tablets will be speckled and organic-looking :)  <br>
<p>
James continues: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...GATT=World Tyranny, not Free Trade!  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Frankly, it is probably too late to do anything about it!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Everyone was too busy calling us conspiracy theorists names </i><br>
<i>&gt; when we told you to oppose the UN, Gatt, Nafta, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and you also told us about the CIA sex slaves.  &lt;g&gt; <br>
<p>
We are trying to find a causal explanation of the fact that certain <br>
products are restricted and others are sold on the open market.  I think <br>
the UN, Nafta, and GATT are irrelevant to this particular point.  <br>
<p>
The main question is:  what is to be done?  There are several ways <br>
to approach this.  One way is to begin by considering what Peter Voss <br>
wrote in Extropy #17, pages 25 - 26:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Extropy is to a large extent a function of money.  Most of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; leading-edge technology that we want for a healthier, safer and </i><br>
<i>&gt; longer life is expensive.  Quality generally carries a premium:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Health foods and supplements(!), timely and effective preventative </i><br>
<i>&gt; and corrective medical care, healthy living environment (low on </i><br>
<i>&gt; pollution and noise), safe cars, homes and equipment, anti-aging drugs </i><br>
<i>&gt; and cosmetics, cryonics.  How much do you think artificial neurons </i><br>
<i>&gt; or genetic engineering will cost initially?  Hot (and healthy) bodies </i><br>
<i>&gt; are an expensive hobby.  Education and knowledge have their price.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Freeing ourselves from unfulfilling work, unpleasant environments </i><br>
<i>&gt; and dreary chores costs money.  Food for the soul, be it art, scientific </i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery or (interplanetary) travel, has to be paid for.  </i><br>
<p>
So, what is to be done?  Make enough money to buy your freedom.  <br>
Bill Gates and Ross Perot don't have to worry about health food stores.  <br>
They can hire their own chemists, if necessary.  Billionaires (and even <br>
multi-millionaires, in many cases) don't have to worry about drugs <br>
being illegal, either.  A marijuana garden in a mansion in Beverly Hills <br>
is not illegal in the same way that a garden in an apartment is illegal.  <br>
<p>
Maybe we are living in an era when basic freedoms are only available <br>
to the very rich.  As Twirlip would say, this kind of sucks in a way, but <br>
if this is reality then we had better recognize it as such.  <br>
