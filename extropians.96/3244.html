<i>&gt;Wasn't it Heinlein who coined it? IMHO it is often used a bit entropically.</i><br>
<p>
I was thinking about this too. <br>
1. Entropians love to<br>
propigate a "lack" mentality, for without the sense of hopelessness - it is<br>
harder to impose limits on people. <br>
<p>
2. I get a lot of lunches and dinners free, and it is the <br>
great pleasure of those who dine with me to provide them. <br>
And I am happy to do the same for anyone who is very fun to talk to. Or very<br>
pretty to look at, for that matter ; - )<br>
Now this doesnt mean that you should freeload or we need to abandon the<br>
notion that trading and exchange should and can be beneficial to both<br>
parties, but the negativity behind these little sayings can be subconsciously<br>
daunting.<br>
<p>
3. Life is full of thess little catch phases-homilies, old <br>
wives tales, fables.... a meme, a myth...<br>
the benefit would be, parents and elders can tell us our<br>
limits, try to warn us, I guess...<br>
But I avoid them all, and even try to avoid repetitious,<br>
obviously pat,  thoughts of my *own*. If I have decided<br>
 "it is so", and invented a little mental script, I am probably atrophy<br>
prone.<br>
There are to many NEW patterns to explore to get stuck <br>
on old ones.<br>
