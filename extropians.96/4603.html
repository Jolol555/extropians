In the throes of revelation, Chris Hind exclaims, "Hey, I just thought of <br>
something! Maybe the life I'm currently living is just a uploaded environment <br>
I've created and have switched on my Programmed Ignorance switch to enjoy and <br>
experience it. Perhaps when we die, we're just exiting the program."<br>
<p>
Actually, this idea's been around for thousands of years.  Mystics throughout <br>
the ages have been saying that we are living in Virtual Reality, in a world of <br>
illusions.  What do you think Jesus meant when he said, "My Father's house has <br>
many mansions.  I go to prepare a place for you." or "My kingdom is not of <br>
this world."?  He's talking about alternate VR worlds.<br>
<p>
Read the book _Illusions_ by Richard Bach.  The message is basically that the <br>
world we see is only an illusion and that one can learn to manipulate it <br>
however one wants to.  The idea is that we create and enter these VR worlds to <br>
learn various skills and knowledge and to have fun playing around.  Some of us <br>
like to get completely immersed in our fantasy worlds, and so we think they <br>
are all there is.<br>
<p>
There are many religions which teach this basic idea; that the world we are <br>
experiencing is an illusion that our soul is experiencing.  Even after we exit <br>
the program (that is, die), our soul is unaffected, no more than we are when <br>
we play video games and our character "dies".  We come away having learned <br>
some things, and we move on to other lessons.<br>
<p>
I have no idea whether this world is an illusion or not, whether there is some <br>
conscious entity outside this system, playing my life, like a very complex <br>
video game.  I have no evidence either way.  I am open to many ideas.  I just <br>
keep working on improving my observational skills and my rational thinking <br>
skills, and hopefully I'll get things figured out.  But whether it's an <br>
illusion or not, I can still have a lot of fun playing around with the reality <br>
I am experiencing and I can learn a lot from my experiences.  And that is the <br>
real point, as far as I'm concerned -- to learn and enjoy.<br>
