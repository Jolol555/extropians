(Btw, I read and respond to the extropians list in what must seem a very<br>
time-smeared, crypto-scrambled fashion.  Sorry if I'm strangely out<br>
of touch....yet, strangely, ah...*prophetic*, yeah, that's it...)<br>

<p>
Anders, what does that last line mean?  Also, what's platonic materialism?<br>
<p>
I am a little slow on the math here, but aren't wave packets in physics a<br>
lot like wavelets?  If so, wouldn't it be possible to pick and choose<br>
between all sorts of basis function sets, not just pure space or pure<br>
frequency?  Maybe we (meaning, the computers we download into) could be<br>
reimplemented in more and more spatially smeared, more and more frequency<br>
localized ways.  Is time-smearing an independent variable here?  Somewhere<br>
I got the impression that this is what "uncertainty" tradeoffs are about,<br>
or is a very close analogy to it... can someone straighten me out (or bend<br>
me, as appropriate)?<br>
<p>
Also, wouldn't the "domain" you're localized in determine how you<br>
perceive the multiverse as split into branches, in the multi-worlds view?<br>
<p>
The particular application I'm thinking about right now is, er, dirt-<br>
computing.  Just realized I haven't really coined a better term for it;<br>
let's try this:<br>
<p>
    Dirt Computing: using matter to compute, in a way that<br>
    looks (at first glance, to some observers at least) like<br>
    undisturbed nature, whether motivated by stealth, efficiency,<br>
    or other concerns.<br>
<p>
(Which points up an interesting thing about current spread-spectrum<br>
communications in this context: Although privacy and pure efficiency are<br>
concerns, the main driving force for it right now is how it lets you<br>
*share space and frequency* more gracefully.  "Dirt communications" is<br>
being developed as a method of *peaceful coexistence*.)<br>
<p>
If one can choose how to be smeared, then wouldn't all the wacky<br>
wavelet bases be available, too, and pseudo-random ones?<br>
<p>
Anyway, if mere spacetime smearing is available, that means civilizations<br>
with a lot of patience could spread themselves more widely and be less<br>
vulnerable to local attacks or sensors.  You could also be doing something<br>
that seems to have very sensible circuit diagrams to you, but looks like<br>
dirt to others.  That means only the post-singularity physicists, not the<br>
post-singularity computer scientists, have to do impossible things.<br>
I hope those Jupiter-brained nerds appreciate my suggestions.<br>

I imagine events on our macro time and space scale appear like weather<br>
to the dirties.  Predicting our actions is like predicting weather,<br>
dealing with us is like dealing with weather, and watching us is like<br>
watching clouds...<br>
   "Oh, there's a horse!"<br>
   "That one looks like a castle!"<br>
...only these guys have femtominiturized Jupiter-brains with more detailed<br>
imaginations...<br>
   "That one looks kinda like an essay on cryptocosmology, if you<br>
    turn your head sideways and squint a little..."<br>
   "Wow, yeah!"<br>
