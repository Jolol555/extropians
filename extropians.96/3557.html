I hate to put up a "me-too" post, but I'm distressed at the way<br>
discussion of the Rapture, er, I mean, Singularity, and discussion<br>
of meme-propagation strategies has taken over the list. I named my<br>
page about memetics "Meme Workshop" for a reason; the attraction<br>
of memetics is not merely in finding and propagating excellent<br>
memes, it is in creating *new* excellent memes, and that takes<br>
work: study, research, experimentation, thinking, and feeling. Lyle<br>
puts the lie to Ecclesiastes even while defending it, and in that<br>
he sets a good example.<br>
<p>
I have always disliked the typical mundane dictum "That's just<br>
science fiction stuff", but seeing the way the list has been going<br>
lately really makes me want to point out that the "Singularity"<br>
really is just science fiction stuff. No one agrees on exactly what<br>
it is or exactly when it's going to happen, and even those who<br>
agree on what it means don't agree on whether or not it would be<br>
a Good Thing.<br>
<p>
As for work, I am curious about how many subscribers to this list<br>
are involved in any of the various free software projects such as<br>
GNU, Linux, or the Debian distribution packaging project. Lately<br>
I have come to a realization that the success of Unix over other<br>
programming environments (and here I'm talking about success with<br>
programmers, not success with users) is a consequence of the fact<br>
that it was designed to evolve in a way that constructivist-rationalist<br>
operating systems such as Windows NT were not. I would not be at<br>
all surprised if the future evolution of free Unixen is intricately<br>
intertwined with other future technological developments, even<br>
though I know all about the shortcomings of Unix (it's not all that<br>
hot at realtime stuff, the main process forking mechanism is<br>
inefficient, the security model puts too much demand on skilled<br>
system administration, etc), but this is where my own interest has<br>
been taking me lately. I am particularly interested in the various<br>
attempts to transmogrify Unix into a distributed operating system<br>
(such as Plan 9, its offspring, and Gnu's HURD).<br>
<p>
What Debian is doing for the evolution of computer software seems to <br>
me to be something roughly analogous to Cairns-Smith's hypothesized<br>
cutover from clay crystals to DNA molecules. The Debian project is<br>
coming up with a standardized system of interchange of "genetic"<br>
(memetic, really) information between computer systems, so that<br>
operating-system modules can be exchanged and improved fairly easily.<br>
Unfortunately, intellectual property restrictions impede this process,<br>
but fortunately, intellectual property restrictions are strictly<br>
optional.<br>
