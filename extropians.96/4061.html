Your mileage may vary.  I know a number of people whom it has<br>
helped immensely. You may have been hit by some unusual and/or<br>
unusually long-lasting side effects.<br>
<p>
There are newer versions that have fewer side effects.  If you<br>
still have trouble with depression or whatever caused you to try<br>
Prozac, you may want to go to an up-to-date doctor and ask him<br>
what he or she would recommend.  Two doctors that I've asked look<br>
favorably on Serzone, but once again, your mileage may vary.<br>
