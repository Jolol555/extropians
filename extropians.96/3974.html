A high school freshman at age 10 - you really were a prodigy!<br>

&lt;Does anyone know how long the SATs have been given?&gt;<br>

Well, Lyle has said he took them back in the early 60s.  However, I <br>
looked back at my own high school transcript and found that there were <br>
a number of other interesting tests that used to be used in (most?) <br>
U.S. schools:<br>
                                 National<br>
Date    Grade   Age    Percentile   Test<br>
<p>
6911        9       14          98          ITED<br>
7011       10      15          97          ITED<br>
--------- psychedelic singularity! -----------<br>
7110       11       16         88          PSAT<br>
7111       11       16         87          ITED<br>
7202       11       16         96          CTMM<br>
7204       11       16         86          SAT<br>
73??       12       17     Skipped the tests?<br>
<p>
ITED = Iowa Test of Educational Development<br>
PSAT = Preliminary SAT<br>
CTMM = Calif. Test of Mental Maturity (IQ?)<br>
<p>
Anyway, the point of this is that focus and attitude can have alot to <br>
do with how well you score on these tests.  I dropped ten percentage <br>
points after going through what I've labeled a 'psychedelic <br>
singularity'.  I think I began ignoring alot of my classwork <br>
(transcript grades reflect this) to study things not on the <br>
curriculum, such as _The Essential Works of Anarchism_, radical <br>
psychology (and other hip topics of that time), letting my verbal and <br>
mathematical skills slip.<br>
<p>
At that time I wasn't planning to go to college right away - I wanted <br>
to "camp out on the land and set my soul free" - and computers were <br>
just something that Big Brother (supposedly) used to control the <br>
'oppressed masses'.<br>
