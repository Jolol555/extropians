<i>&gt;Damien asked about how I get rid of ants. I spray Raid along the crevice</i><br>
<i>&gt;where the wall meets the floor. It stinks. Ants still come in when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;rains. I read, I forget where, that ants will not cross a line of flour. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;haven't tested that.</i><br>
<p>
Someone mentioned "boronic acid".  I've used orthoboric acid to good effect.<br>
I buy it by the pound squeeze bottle and puff it into any crack that I see<br>
ants coming through (and some that I don't).  It's apparently harmless to<br>
humans if you don't eat it or wipe it in your eyes.  Children and pets don't<br>
know not to do this, so you have to sweep it all into the cracks.  I don't<br>
have children or pets, so my house sometimes looks like an explosion in a<br>
baby powder factory.  I've taken to putting it on my finger and spreading<br>
it in the cracks -- saves on boric acid and airborne particles.<br>
<p>
The ants don't come past the stuff I put down, but they keep finding new<br>
cracks.  No surprise -- what else do they have to do with their time,<br>
especially when the alternative is drowning (they mostly try to get in<br>
when it rains)?<br>
<p>
BTW -- ants may or may not like flour, but other bugs (like cockroaches)<br>
love it.  Roaches, on the other hand, also succumb to boric acid.<br>
<p>
Re William Kitchen's comment on salt:  I don't think salt would faze ants<br>
at all -- they have exoskeletons, unlike slugs.<br>
