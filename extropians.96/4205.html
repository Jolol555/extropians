<i>&gt; I had the same experience, at about the same age (21-22), but without</i><br>

<i>&gt; was 20.  The main effect has been concentration: I used to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentrate for hours at a shot.  Now, while I'm not a poster-fella</i><br>
<i>&gt; for ADD, I sure can't.  I can't even concentrate for 5 minutes any</i><br>
<i>&gt; more. </i><br>
<p>
Strange.  Is this always true, no matter what you are doing?  Maybe <br>
you are trying to concentrate on things that don't really interest you.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been thinking that taking up meditation (and stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; reading so much email!) might be a cure.  </i><br>
<p>
Maybe you should use drugs!  Abstinence affects different people in <br>
different ways.  &lt;g&gt;  <br>
<p>
I certainly agree about the e-mail, but it's a hard habit to break.    <br>
<p>
When I was 35 I started playing a video game.  I became obsessed with <br>
it.  I would play for hours at a time.  This could be considered a form of <br>
meditation.  The game required very fast eye-hand coordination (with <br>
both hands), and it required intense visual concentration -- not on an <br>
unchanging pattern, as in some forms of meditation, but on a moving <br>
pattern, which was just what I needed.   The breakthrough came about <br>
six months after I started playing the game.  Something snapped <br>
one afternoon, and that was when I started getting my strength back.  <br>
<p>
If you find something -- anything -- that utterly fascinates you, <br>
something you can do for hours and never think about the time, that <br>
would probably be a cure, or at least the first step towards a cure.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It may not have been the drugs, Lyle.</i><br>
<p>
This is true, of course.  I'm sure it wasn't *only* the drugs.  It was a <br>
complicated situation.  I've been thinking about what Mark said <br>
about "a lack of coherent purpose."  That was part of it.  As I think <br>
back over the sequence of events, there were indications that my mind <br>
may have been starting to freeze up before I took the mescaline.  But <br>
still, I'm sure the drugs made things worse.  I wouldn't take a chance <br>
on it happening again.  <br>
<p>
I guess most people on the list aren't old enough to remember Martha <br>
Mitchell.  She was the wife of John Mitchell, Richard Nixon's <br>
Attorney General.  She came from Arkansas, went to New York, had a <br>
very successful career as a model, married John Mitchell when he was <br>
an up and coming young lawyer, and eventually reached the peak of <br>
the Washington social scene.  She was one of the most famous women <br>
in America in the early 70s.  Then came Watergate.  Her husband was <br>
in disgrace.  She was caught in the midst of something beyond her <br>
comprehension.  John Mitchell divorced her, and left her with nothing.  <br>
Years later, she was living in a cheap hotel.  A writer (whose name <br>
escapes me at the moment) wondered what happened to her, and <br>
sought her out for an interview.  She said  "Life is slippery like a <br>
bar of soap.  If you think you have a good grip on it -- you're wrong."  <br>
<p>
The other side of this is that even if you do lose your grip, <br>
you can always recover.  At least that has been my experience, so far.  <br>
Martha Mitchell, however, died soon after the interview.  <br>
