Chris, I think one of the reasons that you haven't gotten much response on <br>
this one is that it's not something we Extropians/Transhumans are likely to <br>
be able to do much about because it's something that would have to be <br>
coordinated by governments on a global scale.  Also, it's unlikely that any <br>
government is going to try and control the weather (except, perhaps, the <br>
hurricane stuff you mention) without some major breakthrough or disaster - <br>
governments just aren't very innovative or daring, especially since <br>
improving the weather in one place is likely to have adverse side effects <br>
somewhere else.  Furthermore, our weather and climate models, while <br>
steadily improving, are still full of a huge number of unknowns.  We <br>
probably need alot more satellites and other sensors in place to monitor <br>
the weather before we could begin to play around with it.<br>
<p>
On the positive side, as VR and augmented reality become more widespread, <br>
we might see interactive, weather-manipulation simulations become popular, <br>
which would probably increase our knowledge of and appreciation for weather <br>
control enough so that there might be some popular push to get governments <br>
to perform more experiments.<br>
