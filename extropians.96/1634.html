<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    LYLE'S LAW: Whatever the future has in store for us of one thing we</i><br>
<i>&gt;    should be certain, the universe must be constructed in such a way that</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the majority of late 20 'th century bipeds on the third planet</i><br>

<p>
Heh, heh, I had a good chuckle at that, well put, John.  It's nothing new<br>
in the world at large of course, as an inability to accept alternative<br>
futures appears to be endemic in the majority of the population, and it's<br>
more sad than funny.  In contrast, it's quite hilarious to find a few here<br>
wearing their blinkers firmly in place and proudly proclaiming the Earth<br>
to be flat.  They're committing the only real crime possible in futurism,<br>
the denial of future possibility on the grounds of past precedent.  Your<br>
cutting humour is a very mild punishment ... :-)<br>
<p>
Perhaps this issue deserves highlighting a little more strongly within<br>
transhumanist circles.  I think of it as "Memetic Inertia", a force which<br>
acts as a brake on the rate of change in meme space.  It shares a niche<br>
with Neo-Luddite Activism, although it's not the same thing:  NLA is an<br>
active resistance to change on principle, whereas MI is passive and based<br>
not on principle but on a cognitive inability to accept that the world is<br>
in flux and that today's engineering was yesterday's science fiction.<br>
<p>
It applies not only to engineering but to economics and other affairs:  the<br>
sharp discontinuities in economics and politics and society that the world<br>
experienced over the last hundred years or so (eg. when the motor vehicle<br>
wiped out the horse-based economy) are lessons from which one should learn<br>
that "fixed points" are not fixed at all, and that discontinuities should<br>
be expected regularly.  The foundations of our cherished economic system<br>
are wobbly at best, Black Wednesdays being almost an institution.  In that<br>
light, a fixation with continuity in economics even when faced with the<br>
arrival of nanoscale control of materials indicates a total inability to<br>
comprehend the extent of the impact, memetic inertia of the first order.<br>
<p>
I think it was suitable that you gave this episode a humorous turn, John.<br>
Reasoned argument was clearly getting nowhere.<br>
