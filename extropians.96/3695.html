This idea evolved while communicating with Anders Sandberg, thanks to him<br>
for his enthousiastic feedback.<br>
<p>
subject: implanting of plant cell tissue capable of fotosynthesis under the<br>
human skin, to decrease the human dependence on his evironment.<br>
<p>
advantage 1: <br>
The decrease of dependence on food resources for energy, by the 'solar<br>
power' provided by the plant cell tissue.<br>
<p>
advantage 2: <br>
The decrease of dependence on nitrogen/oxygen rich atmospheres, by the<br>
'waste products' provided by the cell tissue.<br>
<p>
options for practical implementation:<br>
Colonization/voyages in hostile atmosphere environments. (space/ocean)<br>
Increasing efficiency in the use of available resources of non hostile<br>
environments. <br>
<p>
To increase efficiency further:<br>
<p>
1) the implanted cell tissue, could provide an oxygen/co2, energy, and (if<br>
combined with 'normal' food intake) waste product exchange locally, with the<br>
underlying cells/bloodvessels.<br>
<p>
A second option would be to link those organs now used to filter those<br>
substances to the tissue under the skin. (lungs, liver , etc) <br>
<p>
the following is a calculation and reation by Anders Sandberg:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;BOTA calculations: We have around one m^2 of skin,</i><br>
<i>&gt;assuming a third of it being in sunlight ought to give us around 100 W or</i><br>
<i>&gt;so of energy.  Plants might have an efficiency of 10% (probably higher,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but let's be conservative), which gives 10 W. Hmm, not bad. Perhaps not</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to sustain us (it is equivalent to a few percent of our daily food</i><br>
<i>&gt;intake), but definitely able to help a bit, get rid of CO2 in the day and</i><br>
<i>&gt;give us oxygen. This might be worth thinking of... </i><br>
<p>
(to increase efficiency further continued)<br>
<p>
2) The tissue under the skin would need a good ventilation system to avoid<br>
it drawing oxygen from the body in the dark. For hostile atmosphere<br>
environments i'm still looking for a solution. <br>
<p>
<p>
the idea developed when i was looking for alternatives to the human<br>
digestive system, to increase the energy output needed for the various<br>
additions to the human body that will become available in the future. <br>
<p>
It would be most efficient when combined with other sources of energy, as a<br>
versatile posthuman would be better off with multiple systems of energy<br>
production. This would increase his/her opportunities to find resources (be<br>
it light, food, fossil fuel or radio active material) needed to produce that<br>
energy, in order to survive more hostile environments.  <br>
<p>
It's also a different way of looking at the options we have, including, as<br>
an addition the the more common technological options, a 'greener' option,<br>
which may even appeal to some of our critics. A human efficiently using<br>
solar power, will become less of a strain on his environment. <br>
<p>
This is just the first setting out of the idea, (maybe there have been<br>
similar ones, i don't know as i'm new to this group), any one interested in<br>
helping it develop ? <br>
<p>
any additions and suggestions are more than welcome.<br>
