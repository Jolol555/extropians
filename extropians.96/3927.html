Eric Watt Forste contributes:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I also suspect that human cognition is far too plastic for us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be able to discuss these things as if they were givens. That's</i><br>
<i>&gt;something that economists pretty much have to do (accept human</i><br>
<i>&gt;values as data) according to the traditions of their discipline,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I like to think that we can do more than merely economic analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt;of ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
I think it's a pretty fine accomplishment to be able to do economic<br>
analysis of ourselves at all. It's a very abstract, revealing, and<br>
objective way of looking at ourselves, and shouldn't be discounted with a<br>
"merely". If a transhuman objective is to "develop rational values" -<br>
whatever those might be - I hope those in the know can tell me - surely<br>
economics is a useful tool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Whether our values are linearly comparable or not, to the extent</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we can only do one thing at a time with our bodies, we hack</i><br>
<i>&gt;out some internal linear measure anyway... that's how we decide</i><br>
<i>&gt;what to do with our bodies at any given moment. This hacked-out</i><br>
<i>&gt;scalar approximation of "value" clearly changes from moment to</i><br>
<i>&gt;moment and differs from individual to individual; it may or may</i><br>
<i>&gt;not be derived from a more stable "deeper structure" which might</i><br>
<i>&gt;be modeled by some more complex data structure than a priority</i><br>
<i>&gt;queue. Furthermore, this hypothetical deeper structure may or may</i><br>
<i>&gt;not have perceivable elements that are "objective": products of</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution that form a reliable (in the sense, I suppose, of living</i><br>
<i>&gt;a satisfying life and attaining reproductive success on both the</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetic and memetic levels???) "basis" for human values. But as</i><br>
<i>&gt;far as I'm concerned, all of this is merely metaphor, because none</i><br>
<i>&gt;of this is at the stage of measurement or prediction yet. It's not</i><br>
<i>&gt;even particularly precise.</i><br>
<p>
At least I agree with this idea that values are revealed by physical<br>
action. What you do reveals your values to others, and sometimes to<br>
yourself. (You may think that you value something, but perhaps it doesn't<br>
affect what you do.)<br>
<p>
Perhaps this "hypothetical underlying structure" has some elements that can<br>
be demonstrated. For instance, I think it's well demonstrated that<br>
evolution has enormous interest in individual control, and has selected for<br>
species and individuals that strive for such control and strive to avoid<br>
helplessness.<br>
<p>
There's been a lot of research, hundreds of studies in psychology, on this,<br>
most recently by Martin Seligman et al. Animals (rats, dogs, primates,<br>
goldfish, even cockroaches) show the benefits of choice and the costs of<br>
helplessness as do Westernized humans like us. They are energized by<br>
control and become passive, depressed, and suffer worse physical health<br>
when they are helpless.<br>
<p>
Given this evidence, one may argue that the value often called "personal<br>
responsibility" or "individualism" or "autonomy" has a deep, primal,<br>
arational basis.<br>
<p>
On this same thread Paul Wafker writes:<br>
<i>&gt;However, I believe that many people who are to adamant about this</i><br>
<i>&gt;sometimes &gt;forget the value of human interpersonal attributes such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;love, honor, &gt;loyalty, joy, etc. which are only very indirectly related to</i><br>
<i>&gt;money.</i><br>
<p>
Let's not fail to see that there are markets at work in all forms of<br>
interpersonal trade, including love, attention, friendship, and loyalty.<br>
