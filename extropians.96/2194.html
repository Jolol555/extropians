                     (DRAFT)<br>
<p>
In September 96, Boneh Demillo and Lipton from Bellcore announced an<br>
ingenious new type of cryptanalytic attack which received widespread<br>
attention (see, e.g., John Markoff's 9/26/96 article in the New<br>
York Times). Their full paper had not been published so far, but<br>
Bellcore's press release and the authors' FAQ (available at<br>
<a href="http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html">http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html</a>) specifically<br>
state that the attack is applicable only to public key cryptosystems<br>
such as RSA, and not to secret key algorithms such as the Data Encryption<br>
Standard (DES). According to Boneh, "The algorithm that we apply to the<br>
device's faulty computations works against the algebraic structure used<br>
in public key cryptography, and another algorithm will have to be devised<br>
to work against the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key<br>
techniques." In particular, the original Bellcore attack is based on<br>
specific algebraic properties of modular arithmetic, and cannot handle<br>
the complex bit manipulations which underly most secret key algorithms.<br>
<p>
In this research announcement, we describe a related attack<br>
(which we call Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA), and show that<br>
it is applicable to almost any secret key cryptosystem proposed so far<br>
in the open literature. In particular, we have actually implemented<br>
DFA in the case of DES, and demonstrated that under the same<br>
hardware fault model used by the Bellcore researchers, we can<br>
extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof DES encryptor by<br>
analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown cleartexts.<br>
The power of Differential Fault Analysis is demonstrated by the fact<br>
that even if DES is replaced by triple DES (whose 168 bits of key were<br>
assumed to make it practically invulnerable), essentially the same attack<br>
can break it with essentially the same number of given ciphertexts.<br>
<p>
We would like to greatfully acknowledge the pioneering contribution<br>
of Boneh Demillo and Lipton, whose ideas were the starting point of<br>
our new attack.<br>
<p>
In the rest of this research announcement, we provide a short technical<br>
summary of our practical implementation of Differential Fault Analysis of<br>
DES. Similar attacks against a large number of other secret key cryptosystems<br>
will be described in the full version of our paper.<br>
<p>
<p>
TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE ATTACK<br>
<p>
The attack follows the Bellcore fundamental assumption that by exposing<br>
a sealed tamperproof device such as a smart card to certain physical<br>
effects (e.g., ionizing or microwave radiation), one can induce with<br>
reasonable probability a fault at a random bit location in one of the<br>
registers at some random intermediate stage in the cryptographic<br>
computation. Both the bit location and the round number are unknown<br>
to the attacker.<br>
<p>
We further assume that the attacker is in physical possesion of the<br>
tamperproofdevice, so that he can repeat the experiment with<br>
the same cleartext and key but without applying the external<br>
physical effects. As a result, he obtains two ciphertexts derived from<br>
the same (unknown) cleartext and key, where one of the ciphertexts is<br>
correct and the other is the result of a computation corrupted by a<br>
single bit error during the computation. For the sake of simplicity,<br>
we assume that one bit of the right half of the data in one of the 16<br>
rounds of DES is flipped from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and that both the<br>
bit position and the round number are uniformly distributed.<br>
<p>
In the first step of the attack we identify the round in which the<br>
fault occurred.  This identification is very simple and effective: If<br>
the fault occurred in the right half of round 16, then only one bit in<br>
the right half of the ciphertext (before the final permutation) differs<br>
between the two ciphertexts. The left half of the ciphertext can<br>
differ only in output bits of the S box (or two S boxes) to which this<br>
single bit enters, and the difference must be related to non-zero<br>
entries in the difference distribution tables of these S boxes.  In<br>
such a case, we can guess the six key bit of each such S box in the<br>
last round, and discard any value which disagree with the expected<br>
differences of these S boxes (e.g., differential cryptanalysis). On<br>
average, about four possible 6-bit values of the key remain for each<br>
active S box.<br>
<p>
If the faults occur in round 15, we can gain information on the key<br>
bits entering more than two S boxes in the last round: the difference<br>
of the right half of the ciphertext equals the output difference of<br>
the F function of round 15.  We guess the single bit fault in round<br>
15, and verify whether it can cause the expected output difference,<br>
and also verify whether the difference of the right half of the<br>
ciphertext can cause the expected difference in the output of the F<br>
function in the last round (e.g., the difference of the left half of<br>
the ciphertext XOR the fault).  If successful, we can discard possible<br>
key values in the last round, according to the expected differences.<br>
We can also analyse the faults in the 14'th round in a similar way.<br>
We use counting methods in order to find the key.  In this case, we<br>
count for each S box separately, and increase the counter by one for<br>
any pair which suggest the six-bit key value by at least one of its<br>
possible faults in either the 14'th, 15'th, or 16'th round.<br>
<p>
We have implemented this attack on a personal computer.  Our analysis<br>
program found the whole last subkey given less than 200 ciphertexts,<br>
with random single-faults in all the rounds.<br>
<p>
This attack finds the last subkey.  Once this subkey is known, we can<br>
proceed in two ways: We can use the fact that this subkey contains<br>
48 out of the 56 key bits in order to guess the missing 8 bits in<br>
all the possible 2^8=256 ways. Alternatively, we can use our knowledge<br>
of the last subkey to peel up the last round (and remove faults that<br>
we already identified), and analyse the preceding rounds with the same<br>
data using the same attack. This latter approach makes it possible to<br>
attack triple DES (with 168 bit keys), or DES with independent subkeys<br>
(with 768 bit keys).<br>
<p>
This attack still works even with more general assumptions on the<br>
fault locations, such as faults inside the function F, or even faults<br>
in the key scheduling algorithm.  We also expect that faults in<br>
round 13 (or even prior to round 13) might be useful for the analysis,<br>
thus reducing the number of required ciphertext for the full analysis.<br>
<p>
OTHER VULNERABLE CIPHERS<br>
<p>
Differential Fault Analysis can break many additional secret key<br>
cryptosystems, including IDEA, RC5 and Feal.  Some ciphers, such as<br>
Khufu, Khafre and Blowfish compute their S boxes from the key material.<br>
In such ciphers, it may be even possible to extract the S boxes<br>
themselves, and the keys, using the techniques of Differential Fault<br>
Analysis.  Differential Fault Analysis can also be applied against<br>
stream ciphers, but the implementation might differ by some technical<br>
details from the implementation described above.<br>
