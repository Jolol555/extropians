<i>&gt; I agree with Shaun.  I didn't get turned on to most of the ideas that &gt; fascinate me so much as the result of media hype or some leader.  I &gt; was just a curious mind, and I explored the world of ideas because it &gt; was fascinating to me.  This is what I want to encourage:  people &gt; quietly exploring the ideas which interest them.  No fanfare.  No &gt; media hype.  No leaders.  Just people pursuing their own interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have nothing against highly respected people (a.k.a. "leaders); in &gt; fact, I wish to become one myself.  But I believe that people's most &gt; influential leaders should be themselves; that people should look to &gt; themselves to decide what to do with their lives rather than doing &gt; what others say they "should" do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The revolution that is occuring right now on this planet in freedom &gt; and independence of thought and the general "waking up" of humanity is &gt; a very quiet revolution.  It's a revolution that takes place within &gt; individual humans, as individuals start realizing that they can take &gt; control of their own lives and become the people they want to be.  &gt; It's not something that receives a lot of media hype, because each &gt; time the revolution happens, it only involves a single person.  People &gt; just start waking up and getting their lives figured out; they start &gt; realizing what they want and how to make it.  It's nothing that is &gt; decided by the government leaders, and they actually have very little &gt; influence over the revolution, since they don't have fine-grained &gt; control over every individual's mind.  The revolution is not an &gt;organization; it has no leaders.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Those who do free themselves to run their minds and lives how they &gt; want certainly have influence on other people; especially people they &gt; are close to.  People see them and see their freedom; they see someone &gt; who is not a sheep, who doesn't respond to things the same way that &gt; the flock does.  Some people are scared to leave the flock and become &gt; independent, but many people see the example of those who do free &gt; themselves, and they desire freedom also.  So they start figuring out &gt; how to do it, mostly on their own, learning how to take responsibility &gt; for their own lives, their own decisions, their own thinking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The single most important thing we can do to advance the quiet &gt; revolution is to continue making ourselves more free and powerful.  &gt; "Spreading the word" is not nearly as important as living it.  Freedom &gt; is not something that can be pushed on people or hyped up very much.  &gt; People will come to freedom when they are ready to take charge of &gt; their own lives.  Freedom is much more difficult a lifestyle than the &gt; alternative; if it wasn't so tremendously rewarding, there would be no &gt; reason to seek it out.</i><br>
