Cutting costs is a valid component in creating better products.  In fact,<br>
it's the component that makes those products available to the "masses."<br>
<p>
I suppose people do buy a lot of "junk."  That's their right; the Earth is<br>
not nearly as fragile as most environmentalists presume.<br>
<p>
Here's what I consider truly sinister: government bureaucrats (or<br>
gov't-appointed committees of "experts") deciding which products should be<br>
produced and which should not.<br>
<p>
Although the profit motive is not based on any specific morality, gov't<br>
regulation is: the morality of arrogance and corruption.  It is no surprise<br>
to some of that the Soviet Union and other socialist nations have been the<br>
biggest creators of pollution and "junk" products.<br>
<p>
Businesses can be voted out of existence by consumers.  Most career<br>
government bureaucrats have jobs for life.<br>
