Some of you may have heard of this paradox before, but I think that it's<br>
a paradox especially appropriate to an Extropian mailing list.<br>
<p>
The paradox goes like this.  Omega, customarily spoken of as "a<br>
superbeing from another planet" but here a Power or superintelligence,<br>
arrives on Earth and performs an experiment on humans.<br>
<p>
The experiment goes as follows.  Omega puts you in a room with two<br>
boxes, A and B.  Box A, Omega says, definitely contains $1,000.  Box B<br>
may contain either $1,000,000 or nothing.<br>
<p>
And then Omega says:  "You have two choices.  You can take both boxes, A<br>
and B.  But if I expected you to do this, I have left box B empty.  You<br>
get only $1,000.  Or you may take only box B.  If I expected you to do<br>
this, I have put $1,000,000 in box B.  You get it all.<br>
<p>
Omega waves farewell and zooms off to his home galaxy, leaving you in a<br>
room with two boxes.<br>
<p>
Do you take only box B, figuring that you'll get the million dollars<br>
that will be there?<br>
<p>
Or do you take both boxes... on the theory that Omega has made his<br>
prediction and left, so you can't possibly get LESS money by taking both<br>
boxes?<br>
<p>
(You can make Omega as accurate as you like; for example, you can assume<br>
that he's performed this experiment on 100 people before you and he was<br>
always right.)<br>
<p>
Consider on one hand that fifty people took only box B and got a million<br>
dollars, while fifty people took both boxes and got a measly thousand. <br>
The cause and effect seem fairly straightforward.<br>
<p>
Consider on the other hand that if you have a friend who peeks inside<br>
the boxes, then no matter WHAT their respective contents, he will want<br>
you to take both boxes.  And since the contents of the box are<br>
absolutely fixed while and after you make your decision - this is a<br>
condition of the paradox - who needs a hypothetical friend to know that?<br>
