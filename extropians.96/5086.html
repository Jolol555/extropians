I think the intuition here is that official borders often try to<br>
approximate natural game-theoretic "Schelling Point" boundaries of<br>
existing military powers.  If there is a line such that if I expect<br>
you to cross it I will want to try and repell you, and vice-versa, and<br>
if given these responses neither of us wants to attack, then we have a<br>
stable border.  A "border" for which there is not such an equilibrium<br>
is much less useful.<br>
<p>
Under current military technology, putting a kid with a gun on a hill<br>
greatly deters attack, relative to just a flag sitting there.<br>

<p>
I don't think these old homestead laws will be that useful here; we<br>
can't really create rules to approximate natural military boundaries<br>
until we learn more about the military space technology that will be<br>
concurrent with actual space colonization.<br>
<p>
To the extent that there are large powers or legal systems which can<br>
enforce contracts, then we can begin to think more in terms of<br>
allocating space property rights in a more efficient manner, rights<br>
which can be enforced via this power or legal system.  But to the<br>
extent that colonists are beyond the reach of such law, there isn't<br>
much point in gaining such property rights.  <br>
