     Now we have come to an issue which I think is important in the here and<br>
now, and about which I seem to have serious differences in viewpoint from most<br>
others. I would like to see what others think of my idea. I do not think that<br>
privacy is "evil", but simply that it is counterproductive to communications<br>
and to mutual understanding in human relations. In addition, in my view a<br>
person who has high self esteemm, ie. is proud of all his/her thoughts and<br>
actions should have no need for any privacy and, in fact, should be completely<br>
happy to have these things all open to the public.<br>
<p>
     In our present society, where scarciety rules and it is necessary to<br>
retain privacy of ideas which might produce wealth for oneself, it seems that<br>
some kind of privacy is necessary. For an alternative to this which I believe<br>
is portrayed very convincingly (and which I just loved when I read it) I<br>
recommend readers to James P. Hogan's "Voyage from Yesteryear"<br>
<p>
     In all my dealings with others, I try to be as open and revealing of my<br>
inner most thoughts as possible. I reject totally the idea that "white lies"<br>
are OK. Furthermore, I have stated many times that my desire to be able to<br>
communuicate with fidelity what I am is so great (and I seem not be able to<br>
accomplish this by standard interpersonal methods), that I would very much<br>
welcome a human augmentation which would allow us all to transmit and receive<br>
each others thoughts. I have stated that if such an augmentation were possible,<br>
then I would volunteer to be the first to allow others to read his thoughts. I<br>
believe that it would (eventually) be a much less violent and generally better<br>
world, if everyone could read everyone else's conscious mind whenever they<br>
liked. (Although if instituted suddenly it might lead to more than half the<br>
world's population killing each other.)<br>
<p>
My basic point here is to question the rationality of anyone valuing privacy.<br>
<p>
Let's hear what others think of this.<br>
