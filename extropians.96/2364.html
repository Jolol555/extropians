        What you are about to read has probably been said before.  I<br>
apologize for any possible inconsistancies this post may have, due to my<br>
constant scrambling to the door --it *is* Hallowe'en night!<br>
<p>
        There has been a lot of signal bouncing around for the past few<br>
months on this; signal --not noise-- dealing with consciousness and<br>
knowledge.  Questions have been raised about the feasibility of two parallel<br>
'selves' living at the same time.  In addition, there have been queries upon<br>
putting one's consciousness onto a computer chip.  Can there be two lives at<br>
once?  Can there be two 'mes'?  <br>
<p>
        My theory on this (and please inform me if someone has their name<br>
put to this) is that there *can* be two (or more) consciousnesses stemming<br>
from one original consciousness.  However, the exact millisecond that the<br>
second consciousness is conceived from the first, it has a new life; it is<br>
its own and no-one elses.  Even though the prototype consciousness may think<br>
that it has the same past experiences as the first, it truly has its own<br>
life from the point of its conception.  <br>
<p>
        In my opinion (and as far as I know), at the point of any<br>
consciousnesses conception --be it from birth or post-conceptual copying--<br>
there are a certain amount of chemicals in the brain that allow a<br>
consciousness to be developed.  From that initial potential, every single<br>
experience will add to the general consciousness.  <br>
<p>
        Let me tie this back in with post-conceptual copying.  If my(?)<br>
theory is true, then from the moment of the cloned consciousnesses<br>
conception, it will *not* be the original.  It cannot be what already is.<br>
The cloned consciousness will be only what it is, not what its creator is.<br>
When the cloned consciousness 'comes to be,' it will have a radically<br>
different view than what the original will.  It will feel the emotions of<br>
fear and uncomprehension wheras the original will feel awe and probably<br>
satisfaction.<br>
<p>
        I've never been much of a scientist, but I've heard that a<br>
consciousness can be created through a seemingly infinite amount of binary<br>
1's and 0's.  I can only assume that there are thousands of binary numbers<br>
added to the consciousness every millisecond.  The only time the conscious<br>
mind is stagnant is either pre-conception or clinical death.  I wonder<br>
whether or not there is any form of consciousness while under cryonic<br>
suspension?  Hmmm.<br>
<p>
        Now, of course, the only obstacle to cloning seems to be the actual<br>
cloning process; in effect, putting the mind on a microchip.  If the last<br>
paragraph is true, then I believe it will be possible to take one's<br>
consciousness at a certain point and copy it.  Seeing as how this theory<br>
states that the binary code constantly carries on, the 'consciousness donor'<br>
(forgive my crude wording) will have to be content with cutting the code at<br>
some point until the computer chip can process the consciousness.  From that<br>
point, the consciousness is in a suspended state; like a genie in a lamp.<br>
When the chemicals (or counter-<br>
programs) are harvested to allow for a consciousness, the microchip can be<br>
activated.  From that moment on, the consciousness will constantly have new<br>
experiences added to it.  The biggest problem with *this* stem of my(?)<br>
theory is that the microchip has to have enough room for its consciousness<br>
to expand within.  In other words, the chip has to have a tremendous amount<br>
of room to allow for consciousness expansion.  Another drawback is the need<br>
for a dramatically high processing speed.<br>
<p>
        This theory is a fair amount to chew on and mull over and --as I<br>
said before-- I'm no scientist, and consciousness is a highly scientific<br>
issue.  I do, however, think that this will be feasible within the next<br>
fifty years.  Please pick apart this theory, as it is only intended to<br>
explore one of the infinite possibilities...<br>
