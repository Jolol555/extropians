<i>&gt;I do have a complete philosophy, or at least a philosophy that aims at</i><br>
<i>&gt;completeness, and Extropianism is a subset of it. I like to refer to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;more complete system as...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maxism.</i><br>

Cute name.  It would be neat seeing it in the title of a book, and<br>
watching everyone walk by it in the bookstore and think it was a typo<br>
on the cover of a communist rant.<br>
<p>
How do you jump the is/ought barrier?<br>
<p>
For those who may not already know, here's a description of the<br>
barrier: Perhaps one can come up with a reasonable guess about what is<br>
true, but even with perfect knowledge of what is true, it is far from<br>
obvious how to convert this to a decision about what to do next.  The<br>
"is/ought barrier" is this logical gap between what "is" and anything<br>
having to do with planning personal or group action.<br>
<p>
I jump it by taking the premise that I choose to try to do things that<br>
have consequences interesting to me.  Each action has a chain of<br>
consequences, and I want the consequences of my actions to go off<br>
toward the future as far as I can forsee without them becoming boring.<br>
Thus, for instance, I generally try to avoid doing things that would<br>
kill me, since my death would lop off a giant bunch of interesting<br>
consequences.  It might not lop off all of the interesting<br>
consequences of things I have done, since, for instance, somebody in<br>
the future might conceivably read my thesis and do something useful<br>
with it.  (Ha!)  <br>
<p>
This strategy of leaping the barrier would also have worked a few<br>
hundred years ago when personal death was obviously inevitable, if my<br>
descendants, my peers, or my intellectual works had some plausible<br>
chance of being at the beginning of an infinite interesting chain of<br>
consequences.<br>
<p>
Answers to this question from people other than Max are interesting<br>
too.<br>
