<i>&gt;Kelley argues that benevolence should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;regarded as a major virtue, and shows the rationality (based on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-interested pursuit of life and flourishing) of civility, generosity,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and sensitivity.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, the pancriticalist's understanding of rationality can be construed<br>
so as to imply that a person is rational only in so far as they are<br>
prepared to seriously consider criticisms of their positions. And given the<br>
well-known difficulties in communication, seriously considering a criticism<br>
involves being sensitive to different senses in which words may be applied,<br>
sensitive to the values that might motivate this particular criticism, etc.<br>
<p>
"Compassion" is derived from words meaning "feeling with", and for<br>
practical purposes, I think it is very difficult to seriously consider any<br>
attempt at criticism without making some attempt to "feel with" the<br>
criticizer. Misunderstanding is easy, particularly if one is adopting a<br>
stance which promotes misunderstanding. Compassion is a psychological<br>
stance that enhances the reception and understanding of messages, including<br>
criticisms.<br>
<p>
Looked at this way, we can construe compassion as not merely something that<br>
rationality recommends, but as one of the sources from which full<br>
rationality springs.<br>
