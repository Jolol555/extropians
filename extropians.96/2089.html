...just watched the suspension on TV - not bad, definitely gave the first<br>
optimistic, positive view I have seen in the media- the nanobot graphics were<br>
pretty fun... Hey, it was great to see the familiar Alcor faces, and watch<br>
the procedure! They even showed then drilling his head open!  Feet look<br>
really interesting when they are frozen...<br>
Amazing....<br>
The whole tone was respectful and yet skeptical, I enjoyed watching. <br>
The closing statement:  : 0 )<br>
"....is stan just another frozen corpse or part of one of the longest and<br>
most amazing experiments in history...?" <br>
