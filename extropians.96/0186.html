Tim. It is not clear to me whom you are calling a <br>
"recreational offender". I believe that non specific name calling often<br>
has the harmfull consequence of causing unintended targuts to feel attacked.<br>

<p>
Thanks.<br>

The worst enemy of those who now or will need medical care is the politician <br>
who proscribes what doctors are allowed to prescribe and research. <br>
<p>
Those who understand this are strongly encouraged to modify this to <br>
fit their personality, and add this to their signature file, and<br>
organize to recover our freedom from Big Brother.<br>
<p>
For those who wait until they are sick, it will be too late.<br>
<p>
Those who suffer from diseases which might have been cured by fetal tissue <br>
research or schedule 1 drugs banned by Big Brother have the right to<br>
hold those accountable who sat on their hands while they remained ill.<br>
