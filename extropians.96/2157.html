How could I possibly take that wrong? Thanks! <br>

<p>
The big problem is gene therapy - so far we haven't been able to whip up<br>
the elixir, so to say. Most vectors are just virsuses able to change a few<br>
cells at a time, and that is not very useful (at least not for the<br>
"novelty" gene). Of course, with the right doctor and money, you could<br>
still try it, but gene therapy in the brain is tricky (a modified rabies<br>
virus with retroviral code? Chilling...). <br>

<p>
No, not yet. But I think it is possible today to modify alleles in <br>
embryos? <br>
