In Bayesian terms, the fact that you see a certain population history<br>
up to your moment in life tells you something.  But what exactly it<br>
tells you I'm not so sure.  Neither Gott nor Leslie have put together<br>
a precise Bayesian model which implies the conclusions they think that<br>
their analysis implies.  Leslie even thinks that Bayesian analysis<br>
isn't up to this task.  There is a good opening here for some careful<br>
thinking.  <br>

<i>&gt;What is the most interesting period to simulate?  Why, the Transition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;of course: those brief millenia when we went from being paleolithic</i><br>
<i>&gt;cavemen to posthuman gods.  </i><br>
<p>
This assumes there is some asymptotic god level which we won't reach<br>
beyond.  What if we just keep on growing? <br>
