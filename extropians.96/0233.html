A superb example of technological electronics combined with extropic<br>
transhuman mythic visuals is exemplified in an instillation by Bill Viola<br>
entitled _Stations_.  Because this work is a traveling exhibition, I thought<br>
some of you might be interested in viewing it if and when it comes to your<br>
area. So far, it has been exhibited in Paris, New York, Eindhoven, and<br>
Stuttgart. (I'm not positive, but it might also be traveling to Madrid and<br>
Tokyo.)<br>
<p>
"_Stations_ is comprised of five channels of video projections, screens,<br>
granite, and sound.  Five cloth screens are suspended from the ceiling of<br>
the darkened gallery.  Large slabs of polished black granite are placed flat<br>
on the floor at the bottom edge of each screen.  Individual human figures<br>
submerged in water head downward are projected onto each screen. On the<br>
slick surfaces of granite slabs one sees the righted reflection of the<br>
slowly moving figures.  Underwater sounds fill the gallery space.  At random<br>
intervals the projected figures glide slowly out of the frame, leaving the<br>
space dark and silent. Suddenly the figures plunge back into view with<br>
brilliant splash of sound and light, momentarily illuminating the entire<br>
gallery."<br>
<p>
The above-interpretation of the installation is descriptive, but it is even<br>
more vibrant and symbolic.  While entering the gallery space, it is actually<br>
solid black with only the slightest hint of light which gives a direction to<br>
follow.  The underwater sound is magnificent - reverberating throughout the<br>
space.  The five video screens are impeccably designed and are in exacting<br>
rectangular shapes from a frontal view and from the side-view appear as very<br>
thin lines of light (like lasers).  The floating bodies are life-size and<br>
naked, and basically in black and white with only a hint of earth tones in<br>
the hair of one model.  The light is very bright from the video screens, yet<br>
the bodies float slowly and gracefully.  Every now and then a body<br>
disappears into blackness and then reemerges with a sudden and shocking<br>
splash - as if being suddenly woken up.<br>
<p>
Interpretations of this intentionally poetic and meditative installation are<br>
varied.  Some see the video-screens with suspended bodies as cryonic dewars<br>
with suspendees.  The artist himself states, "There is no single viewing<br>
angle to the piece, and viewers are free to enter and move about the space<br>
at will.  An initial surface appearance of the eerie, serene beauty ...<br>
isolated, free-floating bodies evoking an eternal state between dream and<br>
death."<br>
