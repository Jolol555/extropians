True, but there is evidence that we're evolving to that point in the fact<br>
that we do _try_ to control ourselves as well as we can create designer<br>
emotions already <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
*BINGO!*<br>
<p>
Having a choice about what emotions to feel is reportedly a big part <br>
of certain cultures. It is quite uncommon in many parts of the world.<br>
<p>
My personal explorations with alternativs to disthymia (sp?) have <br>
convinced me that the Hedonistic Imperative is in line with optimal <br>
use of the current squishwae I'm limited to. Check out <br>

Now, I think that "negative emotions" are sometimes kind of like <br>
hunches--us trying to tell us something we perhaps have been ignoring <br>
or don't want to hear. Ergo, la-di-da soma-dosing is not anything I'd <br>
advocate. But emotional stuckness is still stuckness, and subclinical <br>
depression is not objectivity, it's subclinical depression. :)<br>
<p>
BTW, note to whoever was asking, I think the de Bono book you wanted <br>
was titled (The(?)) Mechanism of Mind. I haven't read it as such, but <br>
I'm sure a lot of it has seeped into his later books. It's <br>
interesting to stack that model up side by side with Minsky and Jung <br>
and even Freud (gasp!) and Reich (double gasp!!) -- and them look at <br>
it all through evolutionary-psychology-colored glasses. :) :)<br>
<p>
MMB, happy to be happy more often<br>
at but not for, etc.<br>
