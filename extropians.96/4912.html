<p>
Yes, you are misunderstanding me. What I am trying to point out that the<br>
same psychosocial mechanisms are active now as they were then, and quite<br>
definitely with negative consequences for both individuals and society. <br>
It is a chilling but interesting area of group psychology. <br>
<p>
Some similarities between the witch trials and modern pedophile trials are<br>
quite striking, such as basing the verdict of hearsay, the idea that<br>
children cannot lie (Urban Hjärne ended the Stockholm witch trials 1676<br>
when he managed to demonstrate that this was not true. Some self-appointed<br>
"experts" still claim small children cannot lie today), defending the<br>
accused is viewed with great suspicion, the fact that just being accused<br>
is enough to warrant a trial and rumors about evil conspiracies (sabbaths,<br>
pedophile networks, the world communist conspiracy). <br>
<p>
The problem is that the diffuse fear and hate of people crystallize<br>
against what is perceived as a truly evil enemy (witches or pedophiles),<br>
and a largely irrational witchunt ensues that wrecks many innocent lives<br>
and forces the juridical system in a draconian direction. <br>
<p>
I think we should be aware of the danger that this kind of memetic<br>
epidemic could turn against us; it is not the most likely threat, but it<br>
could be very damaging. <br>
<p>
The conditions for a witchunt seems to be an atmosphere of fear,<br>
self-appointed experts that can profit from the spread of the meme, an<br>
enemy that is seen as utterly evil by everyone but still exists hidden<br>
inside society; the enemy is both impossible to identify with and could be<br>
anyone. <br>
<p>
Suggested counterstrategies to prevent us from being targeted:<br>
<p>
1.	Somehow reduce societal tensions and the zero-sum meme. Hard.<br>
<p>
2.	Make sure we are present in the debate and media from the <br>
	beginning, arguing with the "experts" and destroying their<br>
	arguments.  This both reduces the alienness of extropianism and<br>
	prevents the "experts" of gaining a memetic monopoly. <br>
<p>
3.	Make ourselves somewhat visible. Not necessarily obvious, but <br>
	enough visibility to make people realize that we are people too<br>
	and do not hide what we are doing.<br>
<p>
4.	Spread counter memes, such as self-ironic jokes. <br>
<p>
Sounds paranoid? You bet. But better safe than sorry, and besides many of <br>
these strategies are good PR anyway. <br>
