<p>
One reason for that is that the &gt;H owner unsubscribed some people who signed<br>
up for the extropians list, without telling us. I just assumed that the list<br>
had gone under due to technical problems, and only recently resubscribed<br>
(haven't seen much there to make it worthwhile though).<br>
<p>
A lesser reason for the switch may be because extropians web-based archiving<br>
works, whereas &gt;H has been broken for quite some time.<br>
