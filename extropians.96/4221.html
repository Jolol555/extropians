     I have always been a great believer in the power of my subconscious to<br>
continue working on problems behind-the-scenes, and to place the answers into<br>
my conscious mind at the appropriate time. This used to often happen upon<br>
waking in the morning when I was much younger and doing more technical<br>
math/physics type thinking. However, it still works with me and happens in the<br>
morning shower or at other time of relaxation and head clearing.<br>
     It is now my rule of operation, to *not* spend a lot time on a problem<br>
once I have communicated to myself what are its basic parameters. I find it<br>
much more efficient to leave my subconscious to work on the problem, while "I",<br>
my conscious that is, does other routine work. In fact, if I *do* work too hard<br>
at consciously finding the answer, it even becomes more difficult to leave it<br>
alone and for my subconscious to work. I don't really understand why this is<br>
so. Anyway, I always think that it is neat to have, in effect, many independent<br>
processors inside my head working on different problems at the same time.<br>
