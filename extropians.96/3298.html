<i>&gt;As for the way far out, he has plenty to say about it. One of his favorite</i><br>
<i>&gt;novels is The Diamond Age, by Neal Stephenson. Its plot is built around</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology, the science of manipulating individual atoms to build</i><br>
<i>&gt;devices and circuits. Although nanotechnology is being taken more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;seriously, its possibilities seem positively chimerical. At its extreme,</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology would allow us to create stuff--anything from a chair to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;blimp--out of practically nothing. "So many of the things people do are</i><br>
<i>&gt;going to be unnecessary when matter can be rearranged arbitrarily," says</i><br>
<i>&gt;Andreessen. "I mean, this gets into all kinds of bizarre stuff.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Immortality. There's no fundamental reason why the breakdown of cell</i><br>
<i>&gt;structures is inevitable." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"There's no reason death should happen," he rushes on. "There's no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;decay shouldn't be totally repairable. There's no reason you shouldn't be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to design exactly the body you want." </i><br>
<p>
Maybe we should contact Marc somehow and introduce him to the extropians?<br>
This would increase the familiarity and public awareness of the group. He'd<br>
be a valuable asset as well as a superior forward thinker. Also it makes me<br>
wonder if Ross Perot invested in that nano company due to the possibility<br>
for immortality. Many wealthy successful people will do that if the're smart.<br>
