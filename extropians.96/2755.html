<p>
I think the most nontrivial problem might be to create an environment at <br>
all capable to sustain an upload... Making it stable is easy in <br>
comparison (actually, it's simply a side effect of the implementation <br>
paradigm naturally suggesting itself  ;)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; We need a large number of processes that interact in a robust, efficient </i><br>
<i>&gt; way (no, no upload can run as a single process - physics prevents that </i><br>
<p>
No, not even a single, biologically realistic neuron can be run in <br>
realtime on a current single-processor machine, however capable. (Just <br>
ask Joe Strout of MURG, he'll quote chapter &amp; verse).<br>
 <br>
A standard workstation class system (regardless, whether it has or <br>
hasn't got an FPU) equates to about 100 realtime _simplistic toy_ <br>
neurons (integer ops, shifts, primitive logics, lots of lookup tables, <br>
etc.) Whether these toy neurons are equivalent to biologically realistic <br>
neurons at some abstration level (translation procedure from raw voxel <br>
data to labeled geometry, then functionality, then reverse-engineering <br>
the according IAN circuit) is currently unknown (the big IF of uploading, <br>
since we're up shit creek should we be forced to stick to actual wetware <br>
geometry &amp; co). The only way increase the size of the simulation is to <br>
increase memory bandwidth, which means going WSI (wafer scale integration <br>
of CPU/RAM dies, since on-die accesses are orders of magnitude faster, burn <br>
less power and don't need bond pads) really soon. Since die yield goes up <br>
exponentially with die size, and we need a goodish amount of functional <br>
dies/wafer (let's say at least 50%), this means dies must be small <br>
(=simple). The smaller, the better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; powerful single processor systems, we have to go parallel) that can </i><br>
<i>&gt; withstand errors, breakdowns and crashes.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think uploads will run on von-Neumann machines at all. They will <br>
require nonalgorithmic virtual hardware, e.g. Integer Automaton Networks <br>
(a form of ANNs), which will be mapped to extremely braindead molecular <br>
CAMs (unless strong nanotech proves viable, and we can create complex, <br>
compact computer 3d-lattice with better OPS/volume/Watt ratio).<br>
<p>
Such hardware can't crash (if anybody is interested in mapping IANs to <br>
molCAM/quantum dot arrays, I can expand on that). Purely digital <br>
sequential systems should be confined to hybrid use only, everything else <br>
is much too dangerous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example, assume my brain is run on ten processor clusters and one</i><br>
<i>&gt; crashes (because a nano-squirrel munched up the power cable?). How to</i><br>
<i>&gt; handle it?  One natural solution would be to freeze the other nine</i><br>
<i>&gt; clusters as soon as the error is detected (which takes a short time</i><br>
<i>&gt; compared to my emulated mental processes) while error checking takes place</i><br>
<i>&gt; (was the data sent to the other clusters corrupted before the crash? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't want an involuntary digital ECT). Now we need to get the mental</i><br>
<i>&gt; state of one tenth of my mind, either from backup or by backtracking, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; place it on another processor cluster. Clearly nontrivial, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; since most of us don't want to loose too much of our minds when the lags</i><br>
<i>&gt; on our networks become too much and out internal communications become</i><br>
<i>&gt; asynchronus. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The above example suggests that fine-grained parallelism is the way to go </i><br>
<i>&gt; with our minds, we might even be able to stand a few emulated neurons </i><br>
<i>&gt; crashing. </i><br>
<p>
While IANs do not crash, the hardware might die (molCAMs will slowly <br>
deteriorate, requiring periodic hardware "upgrades" (which can occur <br>
transparently incrementally)). However, we harly notice microstrokes, <br>
even though they mean miniature neuron holocausts (several M of 'em, at <br>
a guess). So probably no such elaborate exception handling (which might be <br>
buggy itself, and certainly has negative impact on realtime response, <br>
which is crucial e.g. in battle) is necessary.  <br>
<p>
_Finest_ - grain parallelism is the only option possible.<br>
