<p>
I would like to dissuade people from the use of anti-extropic<br>
chemicals such as "Raid", while definitely worse for the ants,<br>
there is increasing evidence that there use is not in our best<br>
interests either.<br>
<p>
I had a former girlfriend whose family was so anti-bug that they<br>
regularly sprayed the outer window sills of their home with Raid,<br>
funny how they were all severely allergic and had numerous<br>
respiratory problems.....<br>
<p>
Hmmm this might be a good time to start a thread on integrative<br>
medicine, more on that later.<br>
<p>
Back to the ants.<br>
<p>
Ants normally infiltrate a home along an outer wall, as you<br>
indicated they seem to remain there unless it rains. This would<br>
tend to indicate the nest is outside. The best advice I could give<br>
is on the next suuny day, caulk the crevice where the wall meets<br>
the floor, then find the openings on the ground on the outside of<br>
that wall and generously apply the contents of a well heated<br>
teakettle (just plain boiling water). Works great.<br>
<p>
Unless you manage to get the queen they will of course return.<br>
<p>
If you live in a predominately wood structure you might want to try<br>
and reach some kind of symbiosis, ants and termites are mortal<br>
enemies, and the ants will not allow termites to establish<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
I don't know about flour, but since both ant weaponry and<br>
communication are based on acidic compounds as I recall, (formic<br>
and acetic) I wonder what effect baking soda would have?<br>
