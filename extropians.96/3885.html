<i>&gt;The VRML standards are irrelevant to the above point.  VRML is *not* a</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-operating/self-serving environment.  There is an entire layer of</i><br>
<i>&gt;software between the VRML and the operating system/network.  Normally, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;is an HTTP server, but for our purposes, an HTTP server will probably not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficient.</i><br>
<p>
It may not be sufficent but as new protocols are created and standardized,<br>
we will move the world from platform to platform and enrich it with more<br>
and more detail gradually as the technologies improve and thus allow it to<br>
evolve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, the final product *should* use off the shelf</i><br>
<i>&gt;protocols.  The server-side software will be more complex than an ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt;HTTP server due to the additional requirements and miscellaneous internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;protocols.  That you can accomplish everything you wish this world to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with just VRML is wishful thinking.</i><br>
<p>
Describe the world as best you can in text or render it with the help of a<br>
few of the lists graphic artists and gradually move it to the evolving VRML<br>
medium as it continues to grow and improve. Many people are working with<br>
VRML so the ability to move it forward is a for sure and if a new more<br>
efficent format comes along its a sure bet there will be conversion programs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The way you are describing this, the world won't be much better than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet already is.  It will be a chaotic hodge-podge of whatever static</i><br>
<i>&gt;material people put in their FTP directories.  There will be little useable</i><br>
<i>&gt;interactive or dynamic content.</i><br>
<p>
Not so. Java applets will enable dynamic content and could be used to<br>
communicate data between avatars. In fact the new USR 56kbps modems would<br>
be ideal for this sort of communication because they only work 56kbps<br>
recieve and 33.6 send where you would recieve the locations of the avatars<br>
in plain sight at 56kbps but only need to transmit your own location at<br>
33.6kbps.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I want to see personally is a tightly integrated environment that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;everything the Internet wishes it was.  I want to see creative landscapes</i><br>
<i>&gt;and artistic design mixed with person-to-person interaction.  No one should</i><br>
<i>&gt;be restricted from doing what they want, but it should be under the auspices</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a larger plan.  I don't see where these concepts are necessarily mutually</i><br>
<i>&gt;exclusive.  Architecture and design is important if you want this world to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be able to handle more than a dozen simultaneous users.  You can't throw all</i><br>
<i>&gt;the technical and design issues out the window for the sake of convenience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A chaotic software system is neither scalable nor particularly extensible.</i><br>
<p>
So we'll create a standard java applet for communcation! Just say if you<br>
want avatars add this applet and people will because people want<br>
interaction. Besides we can change any of this as we go along. If we all<br>
stick to standard off the shelf products we won't run into deadends because<br>
there will always be some sort of file conversion utility and if we use<br>
standard platform-independent file formats we can easily move them from one<br>
server to another and upgrade the hardware as necessary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And just as a note on 56kbps modems:  They won't work with every service</i><br>
<i>&gt;provider.  The modems assume that the ISP is using a PRI telco connection</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which is the case many times) and not one of the myriad of other options.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the ISP is using a PRI, then the 56kbps modem establishes a 1B quasi-ISDN</i><br>
<i>&gt;connection to the ISP over standard phone lines.  If the ISP uses any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;type of telco connection, you are stuck using the same slow speeds you</i><br>
<i>&gt;always did.</i><br>
<p>
Fortunetly USR has a monopoly on this scene so most of us will come through<br>
ok. Can't satisfy everyone unfortunetly but thats the way it is. Most of us<br>
won't be able to run it as well until we all upgrade to Pentium MMX<br>
200mhzs. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If people wanted to learn VRML, they would learn.  VRML can be a little slow</i><br>
<i>&gt;on older systems, but the requirements aren't terribly steep.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;VRML 2.0 will make the requirements significantly steeper.  Also, some</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating systems are more adept at this type of stuff than others.  Sadly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;some OSs common on older machines (such as DOS/Win3.11) are very poor for</i><br>
<i>&gt;this type of thing.  Win95 works ok though, and a Mac will get you by</i><br>
<i>&gt;(although this is a really poor platform for Java), so a great many should</i><br>
<i>&gt;people should have the minimum development capability.</i><br>
<p>
I would love to see someone like Netscape go in and tear up VRML and richly<br>
enhance it  and make it more powerful or perhaps build it into every<br>
browser not as a plugin or activeX extension but builtin to the code<br>
because being a plugin makes it remain a trivial eyecandy.<br>
