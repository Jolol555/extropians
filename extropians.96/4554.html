Shaun: Something is in the works. This list will remain as it is, but<br>
Extropy Institute will be creating new lists that will be much more<br>
selective. I don't want to say more now, since we're in the planning stages.<br>
I think there will always be a place for an open list like this, but I agree<br>
that something else is needed.<br>
<p>
Wait and see!<br>
