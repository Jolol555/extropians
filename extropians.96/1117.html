Robin said:<br>
If there is any sensible distinction between observation and<br>
experiment, it is in one's degree of control over a system.  Observers<br>
look, while experimenters change things (and look). <br>
<p>
I say:<br>
OK, so we appear to have the distinction between disciplines that<br>
1) observe-(model-)predict,<br>
and <br>
2) observe-(model-)make_a_change_in_what's_observed-predict, <br>
correct?<br>
<p>
Do I understand Robin to be saying that category (2) is an <br>
experimental discipline, and category (1) is not?<br>
<p>
Are they both justifiably called "science"?<br>
<p>
What if one _tries_ to make a change on what one is observing, and <br>
discovers that no different result is observed?  Were you not really <br>
conducting an experiment? Example: toggling the power switch on an <br>
appliance which is unplugged.<br>
