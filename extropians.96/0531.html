        As with my last poetry post, I ask for either personal or ML<br>
feedback regarding the poem in question.  This can give me more of an idea<br>
as to the interest in having a web page dealing with transhuman\extropian art.<br>

<p>
                        THE ICARUS TRILOGY<br>
                            -UNABRIDGED-<br>
<p>
<p>
I.)	UNDERWING<br>
<p>
I led a sheltered life<br>
In a labyrinth of strife<br>
My parents stopped my flight<br>
And kept me safe from light<br>
But my appetite for freedom<br>
Eluded their defense<br>
I knew I did not need them<br>
To carry out my life's intents<br>
<p>
Then one day I learned that I<br>
Could make my tender wax wings fly<br>
I was Icarus but my wings never melted<br>
<p>
I got away from the ones who kept me underwing<br>
I flew as high as I wanted to<br>
I did my own thing<br>
I flew like a bird with his heart set on the sky<br>
On simple wings made from wax and string<br>
<p>
In my newfound days of freedom<br>
I discovered a place on high<br>
Set in a source of light<br>
Far beyond the sky<br>
I gathered my mortal strength<br>
And set to fly abroad<br>
A course through the rays of the sun<br>
To the palace of the gods<br>
<p>
I got away from the ones who kept me underwing<br>
I flew as high as I wanted to<br>
I did my own thing<br>
I flew like a bird with his heart set on the sky<br>
On simple wings made from wax and string<br>
<p>
On the day I decided to fly away<br>
I flew to the sun<br>
My wings never melted<br>
But my heart did burn<br>
The days when I was underwing were done<br>
<p>
The gods gave me eternal life<br>
In Olympus on young Sol<br>
They named me the god of hope<br>
And the liberator of soul<br>
The days when I was underwing<br>
Were left far behind<br>
When the light had called to me<br>
I had made up my mind<br>
<p>
I was Icarus but my wings never melted<br>
<p>
<p>
II.)	CLIPPED WINGS<br>
<p>
Throw me down from the heavens<br>
Let me plummet to the deep blue sea<br>
My life as a god<br>
Is not the way I wanted it to be<br>
My views of hope have been lost<br>
Liberations of soul are no more<br>
Let me back to the labyrinth<br>
For I no longer want to soar...<br>
<p>
Immortality<br>
I never meant to reign on high<br>
Immorality<br>
All I ever wanted was to fly<br>
Oh mortality<br>
Your ties long to bound me again<br>
Massed morality<br>
I won't believe in godhood's reign<br>
<p>
The burning heart of my youth<br>
No longer beats in my tight chest<br>
My appetite for freedom<br>
Isn't quite so easy to digest<br>
<p>
Forfeit my wings<br>
For better things<br>
I am Icarus<br>
Please untie my strings<br>
<p>
The sun's not high enough<br>
But what's beyond it just can't be attained<br>
There's more to see<br>
Past where Olympian gods have ever reigned<br>
Bound by righteousness<br>
I'll never be allowed to roam<br>
If I cannot strive<br>
I might as well plunge down to my home<br>
<p>
Immortality<br>
I never meant to reign on high<br>
Immorality<br>
All I ever wanted was to fly<br>
Oh mortality<br>
Your ties long to bound me again<br>
Massed morality<br>
I won't believe in godhood's reign<br>
<p>
Forfeit my wings<br>
For better things<br>
I am Icarus<br>
Please untie my strings<br>
<p>
I am Icarus and my wings should have melted<br>
<p>
<p>
III.)	WINGED ASCENT<br>
<p>
I've been here and I've been there<br>
On this earth I've been everywhere<br>
To the North, the South, the East, the West<br>
A wingless traveler with no rest<br>
And I've found myself looking<br>
At a time I knew before<br>
Longing for a new way<br>
Another future in store<br>
I'd seen the earth from so far away<br>
I thought I might have been blind<br>
But now I know it's the same land<br>
I once had left far behind<br>
<p>
What we see<br>
Isn't always what we're looking for<br>
Implore<br>
Explore<br>
Be more<br>
<p>
When I look back in retrospect<br>
I see one thing I can't affect<br>
And my forlorn destiny<br>
Will forever beckon me<br>
Man is bound on Earth to die<br>
But for me I'd rather fly<br>
Seek out other better things<br>
And don my tender waxen wings<br>
<p>
On a warm and windy night<br>
I'll make my eternal flight<br>
Beyond the sun, beyond the moon<br>
Beyond this solar system's boon<br>
Beyond the Earth and its terrain<br>
Beyond the heavens -so insane<br>
<p>
I am Icarus and I shall fly beyond this plane<br>
<p>
What we see<br>
Isn't always what we're looking for<br>
Implore<br>
Explore<br>
Be more<br>
What we do<br>
Isn't always what has been programmed in<br>
Win<br>
Begin<br>
It's not a sin<br>
<p>
I may never reach my goal<br>
My lunacy might take its toll<br>
But if perchance I ever die<br>
At least I had the will to try<br>
<p>
I am Icarus and I shall fly beyond this plane<br>
<p>
