<i>&gt;Not because of any objective sense of fairness, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;bleeding-heartdom, but because it's objectively stupid to assume that</i><br>
<i>&gt;a huge segment of the population will quietly become obsolete.</i><br>
True. I'm not saying a huge segment will become obsolete. They'll only find<br>
short-lived niche jobs lacking a steady paycheck forcing them to endlessly<br>
look for work, going from job to job to job. The rest will become homeless<br>
but most will go the information/research career route and the niche jobs<br>
will hopefully be only for the fringe.<br>

<i>&gt;And if they don't worry about the people not adapting, someone's going</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be REALLY dead.  I can't say which side it will be, of course.</i><br>
Let them eat cake. :) No, there would be a rebellion so we must develop<br>
memes to cram more info into the shallow minded. How about a Stacker meme to<br>
run on the brain and compress information? :) Here is an idea. We should<br>
list all the things (ie. trances) you can do by concentration and thinking<br>
as well as techniques that make memes highly contageous (sp?) and then<br>
create a meme such as the Gaia theory with an extropian twist to spread<br>
extropianism like a religion across the globe. Could work!<br>
