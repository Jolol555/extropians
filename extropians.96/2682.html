<i>&gt; &gt;Also, the dominant form of biological life will be based on carbon, like</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;A star with a bit too much ultraviolet light output would simply</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Seven Day Planet where massive reproduction, high metabolic rates, and</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps creation or discovery of a silicon-based lifeform would be a large</i><br>
<i>&gt; step toward uploading because a silicon based lifeform would possibly be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more versatile than a carbon based one due to the complexity of the genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; architecture needed to support it. Some of the most successful organisms</i><br>
<i>&gt; grow where the fewest resources exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;i read a recent study of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;likely forms of intelligent aliens. According to the analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;evolutionary behavior, the humanoid form is the most likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;intelligent, though not necessarily mammalian or even human features,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but the bipedal, two eyes and ears, two to four arms, and four to six</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fingered hand, who is omnivorous. Of course,this is based on an expected</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;limited database of how much we think we know about our world, and how</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;little we know about others.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you remember what the publication was? I'd be interested to read it.</i><br>
<p>
It was on the web. I can't remember what i searched under.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Of course</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'd still like to see more people get intelligence amplification enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;so that I can converse with anyone as easily as most of you guys.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the mnumonic trick of the hypertext structure of the web is as powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; as is being suggested, the web may educate the masses into an intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; race. oh no!</i><br>
<p>
Gee, they may all become Libertarians!<br>
