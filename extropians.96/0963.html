The Cerebral Code<br>
Thinking a Thought in the Mosaics of the Mind<br>
William H. Calvin<br>
<p>
The Cerebral Code is a new understanding of how Darwinian processes=20<br>
could operate in the brain to shape mental images in only seconds,=20<br>
starting with shuffled memories no better than the jumble of our=20<br>
nighttime dreams, but evolving into something of quality, such as a=20<br>
sentence to speak aloud. Jung said that dreaming goes on continuously=20<br>
but you can't see it when you are awake, just as you can't see the=20<br>
stars in the daylight because it is too bright. Calvin's is a theory=20<br>
for what goes on, hidden from view by the glare of waking mental=20<br>
operations, that produces our peculiarly human type of consciousness=20<br>
with its versatile intelligence.<br>
<p>
As Piaget emphasized in 1929, intelligence is what we use when we=20<br>
don't know what to do, when we have to grope rather than using a=20<br>
standard response. Calvin tackles a mechanism for doing this=20<br>
exploration and improvement offline, as we think before we act or=20<br>
practice the art of good guessing.<br>
<p>
Surprisingly, the subtitle's mosaics of the mind is not a  literary=20<br>
metaphor. For the first time, it is a description of a mechanism of=20<br>
what appears to be an appropriate level of explanation for many mental=20<br>
phenomena, that of hexagonal mosaics of electrical activity that=20<br>
compete for territory in the association cortex of the brain. This=20<br>
two-dimensional mosaic is predicted to grow and dissolve much as the=20<br>
sugar crystals do in the bottom of a supersaturated glass of iced tea.<br>
