<i>&gt;&lt;Arcologies!! Imagine having a 50 story view looking down on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rainforest? Cool.&gt;</i><br>
It's spelled Arcologies. Lookup Arcosanti or play SimCity 2000, whichever<br>
you prefer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The economics of the architecture requires that most people wouldn't get</i><br>
<i>&gt;any kind of view at all, living and working in the interior.</i><br>
Thats simple, 3-D displays as psudo-windows that way everyone will have a<br>
beach-front view or rainforest view. Whichever you prefer. Imagine an<br>
arcology sitting in the middle of a future 'jurassic park' so that you'd be<br>
looking down onto a prehistoric world from the sky.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Secondly, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;people were allowed "ouside" for recreation, that rainforest would get</i><br>
<i>&gt;trampled for some distance.</i><br>
Telepresence. How about those floating webblimps w/stereoscopic vision? Or<br>
even nanotech utility fog you could control remotely, whatever.<br>
<p>
  (What population density are we talking<br>
<i>&gt;about in this archology?)</i><br>
Depends how large it is.<br>
<p>
  There's too much monkey left in us. <br>
So what? Thats what we are. Heres another interesting question: Why do most<br>
people see monkeys as an icky disgusting creature? Are they? or are we just<br>
looking down on them because they're a lesser form of human?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;BTW, if that window view of nature is so important to your determination</i><br>
<i>&gt;of "cool", doesn't it seem likely that a connection to nature is somehow</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary to the human psyche,</i><br>
absolutely. They've found that staying space for long periods of time is<br>
easier to deal with when there are green plants on board the spacecraft as<br>
well as people who have house plants live healthier then people who don't<br>
and pets relieve stress.<br>
<p>
 perhaps more than an archology can<br>
<i>&gt;offer.</i><br>
Nope.<br>
<p>
  How about this line?  "Arcologies!!  Imagine having a view looking<br>
<i>&gt;at all that plumbing and airvents? Cool."</i><br>
Funny you say that. I know a guy who *does* like plumbing and airvents as a<br>
view in his office, he states it's gothic looking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now mile high buildings within a traditional city are another matter.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt;cool!  (But who will put up with a five minute elevator ride several times a</i><br>
<i>&gt;day?)</i><br>
Maglev propelled elevators? You'd have to control the acceleration rate<br>
though or they'd either rocket through the roof or liquify during the rapid<br>
acceleration.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Okay, I know Max Moore is going to pummel me on this one, but are we</i><br>
<i>&gt;all sticking to the party line that FTL travel is really impossible?  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt;teleportation?</i><br>
I myself don't really care if FTL travel is possible because we'd still have<br>
two other possible technologies which are breaking into planch's length and<br>
leaping to a higher dimension to cut the time in half OR wormholes. And I'm<br>
all for teleportation via nanotechnology. The sooner the better! Commutes<br>
suck! Imagine all the media coverage on the day they finally begin tearing<br>
down the nation's superhighways being rapidly replaced with teleporters.<br>
That would be incredible and I hope to live to see that day.<br>
