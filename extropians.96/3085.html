Not true. We're in the saturation zone already. The development is <br>
discontinous. After maspar becomes mainstream, we'll see a jump, until <br>
we'll hit semiconductor photolitho limits. then we have to wait for <br>
wait for the advent of nanotech.<br>
<p>
Have a look how current machines become. Memory bandwidth is rising <br>
hardly at all. Due to cache hierarchy paradigm, pipelining, branch <br>
prediction, and all that happy shit our machines have become finicky, <br>
unpredictable in respects to optimization. Progressively catankerous.<br>
<p>
Read "High Performance Computing" by Kevin Dowd, O'Reilly. It will make <br>
your hair stand up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Computer power doubles every two *subjective* years.</i><br>
<p>
I dunno. Monster applications hog resources quite efficiently. Very<br>
little, if at all subjective speedup is left.<br>
<p>
How long it takes your machine to boot? Two generations back my <br>
home machine booted in about 1 seconds. It was slow, yet I landed right in <br>
a relatively powerful Basic environment. One could hack algorithms with <br>
it, it was a useful tool.<br>
<p>
On my home unix machine, I require X, shell, xemacs, make, gcc &amp; Co, <br>
needing lots of ugly incantations before I even can begin with solving my <br>
problem. Though Java is 20 times slower, being an interpretive language, <br>
it still offers faster turnaround cycles.<br>
<p>
Sorry, the usefulness has decreased imnsho.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Computer power goes to infinity four years after computer researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reach human equivalence.</i><br>
<p>
Current PC/workstation equivalent to 100 biologically realtime neurons <br>
(_not_ wet neurons).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Mathematically, I believe it's called a "singularity".</i><br>
<p>
Mathematical singularities are not identical with the technological<br>
Singularity. It's just a mental, fuzzy picture. Sufficiently different to <br>
become unpredictable. Way beyond the predictability horizont.<br>
<p>
Ask the maestro himself:<br>
