<i>&gt; OK, so it's 2am-ish and I've just got back from a night out clubbing. And on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way home I was thinking: if I, er, 'physically interacted' with another</i><br>
<i>&gt; person in a virtual world, but the experience was identical to the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; world except that I _knew_ it was only virtual, would that lessen the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think it would --- we live inside our minds, as they say, and<br>
our minds are good at compartamentalizing experiences.  Furthermore,<br>
remembered "real" experiences are often no more vivid than virtual ones,<br>
while virtual experiences can be especially vivid and as pleasureable as<br>
we wish them to be.<br>
<p>
Here's a trivial little example than no doubt many have experienced:<br>
you have a small drink and you turn on the CD player and you play some<br>
of your favourite tracks, and if you got the timing right and all the<br>
other unknowables are in sync then you experience a real high.  You<br>
know that the world hasn't suddenly become a nicer place, and you know<br>
that the same tracks wouldn't give you a high without the drink, and<br>
you know that the one drink wouldn't have any noticeable effect on you<br>
normally, yet you *ENJOY* the high, immensely, despite knowing that it's<br>
not based on anything beyond the bounds of your skull.  The experience<br>
was virtual (in at least one sense of the word) and you knew it, yet<br>
that didn't lessen the experience.<br>
<p>
(I know that this doesn't address the *exact* question you asked, Sarah,<br>
but I think it's reasonably related in the sense that it is experienced<br>
without any direct contact with the world outside our senses.)<br>
<p>
OK, one example doesn't make much of a statistical population.  Can<br>
folks think of others that either support or deny the premise?<br>
