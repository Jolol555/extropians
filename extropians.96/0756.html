I noticed that subject discipline on the list has gotten kind<br>
of lax, with lots of political frustrations coming out.  My bit<br>
in response to the "productive people each supporting<br>
millions of destitute loafers in the future":  Why would we<br>
want to do that?  Point being, they'd just keep breeding<br>
without foresight until they surpassed all the carrying<br>
capacity of the planet, and even with hightech, until in one<br>
last malthusian collapse they tried to consume the<br>
remaining products of civilization, leaving a burned out<br>
world without resources and with a slaughtered intellectual<br>
elite.  Let's face it, the only solution is to make conception<br>
a cognitive and pricey activity, thereby guaranteeing at<br>
least a semblance of planning, foresight and economic<br>
wear-with-all.  Let contagious nanotech provide universal<br>
barriers to all accidental conception.  The population<br>
would drop to very comfortable and elite levels within two<br>
generations.<br>
<p>
As for uploading and becoming von neuman machines. <br>
Honestly, am I the only extropian who likes the flesh?<br>
Maybe I should form a faction of tech fiends who are<br>
sleazy enough to appreciate the aesthetics and primal joy<br>
of a fit sweaty body.  Maybe I'm just an immortalist who<br>
thinks the whole universe should be our domain.  I guess I<br>
wouldn't mind being able to have alternate _identities_  of<br>
man, machine, cyborg, virtual entity--but I certainly don't<br>
want to be constrained to one.  Nor give up the best of<br>
humanity.  A product of the mind is art.  And beauty is<br>
art.  For those who think I'm shallow.  Take a look at<br>
Michelangelo's David.  I guess I'm as attached to physical<br>
beauty as I am to intellectual brilliance and scientific truth. <br>
Anyone else out there feel remotely the same?  Feel free<br>
to email me directly with suggestions or criticisms.  I have<br>
a thick skin, and don't want the list to get clogged with<br>
non-technical issues.<br>
