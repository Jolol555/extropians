In a message dated 96-11-24 14:09:07 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  At a 'fiction' convention, &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I know science fiction (SF) has gotten the "sci-fi" bad name because of all<br>
the non-"hard" science fiction written now.  I'm talking about what Ben Bova<br>
and Stanley Schmidt (Analog) describes about  sci-fi :  non-science fantasy<br>
and mystical stories or stories that would not collapse even if all the<br>
science was taken out.  I might tell people I write amateur SF or actually<br>
say "hard science fiction. "  I don't want myself to be associated with<br>
sci-fi.  On the other hand, look at the cover of the current Extropy and tell<br>
me that's not appealing to New Agers.  So, what's the big deal? Lets have a<br>
booth at a Star Trek or science fiction convention. <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;extropy<br>
 might seem like a 'nice thought' as opposed to an active philosophy.  If we<br>
 want extropianism to be publicized, we want it to be done seriously...&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I lot of people take science fiction seriously, esp. Star Trek.<br>
<p>
&lt;and  well; &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Many conventions are done well and we _would_ have control over our booth,<br>
right?<br>
<p>
&lt;otherwise, most people will turn their noses up at what seems<br>
 unattainable or unrealistic. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
People don't avoid science fiction even if it is unattainable or unrealistic.<br>
 People want to associate themselves with a positive optimistic future even<br>
if they don't think they will see it attained.  I'm sure a lot of people<br>
(pessimistically) didn't think they would see a Moon landing in their<br>
lifetime.  There _will_ be those kind of people.  I would not want to slow<br>
ExI's extropy because of the pessimistic people.  <br>

Dynamically Optimistic,<br>
