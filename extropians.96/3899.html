<i>&gt;&gt;The VRML standards are irrelevant to the above point.  VRML is *not* a</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;is an HTTP server, but for our purposes, an HTTP server will probably not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sufficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It may not be sufficent but as new protocols are created and standardized,</i><br>

<i>&gt;and more detail gradually as the technologies improve and thus allow it to</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolve.</i><br>
<p>
This is a pretty vague assertion.  Yes, 3 or 5 years from now, there may be<br>
a protocol that handles all these things.  But how do you think these<br>
protocols come about in the first place?  Someone has to do it!  The whole<br>
point of this is to be proactive instead of reactive.  The technology exists<br>
*now* to do these things if you are willing to take the extra step to mature<br>
it.  This won't be the first time I have ridden the bleeding edge of a new<br>
technology.  Thats where all the excitement is; doing amazing things that no<br>
one has done before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;However, the final product *should* use off the shelf</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;protocols.  The server-side software will be more complex than an ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;HTTP server due to the additional requirements and miscellaneous internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;protocols.  That you can accomplish everything you wish this world to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with just VRML is wishful thinking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Describe the world as best you can in text or render it with the help of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;few of the lists graphic artists and gradually move it to the evolving VRML</i><br>
<i>&gt;medium as it continues to grow and improve. Many people are working with</i><br>
<i>&gt;VRML so the ability to move it forward is a for sure and if a new more</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficent format comes along its a sure bet there will be conversion programs.</i><br>
<p>
I am not concerned with the capability of VRML.  I believe that VRML is both<br>
a capable environment and evolving in an intelligent, structured manner.  My<br>
assumption has been from the beginning that VRML would be the standard for<br>
interface design and construction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The way you are describing this, the world won't be much better than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Internet already is.  It will be a chaotic hodge-podge of whatever static</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;material people put in their FTP directories.  There will be little useable</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;interactive or dynamic content.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not so. Java applets will enable dynamic content and could be used to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communicate data between avatars. In fact the new USR 56kbps modems would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be ideal for this sort of communication because they only work 56kbps</i><br>
<i>&gt;recieve and 33.6 send where you would recieve the locations of the avatars</i><br>
<i>&gt;in plain sight at 56kbps but only need to transmit your own location at</i><br>
<i>&gt;33.6kbps.</i><br>
<p>
Wishful thinking.  Although client side Java applets would enable dynamic<br>
content and interaction, there are some serious limitations: <br>
<p>
1) Without any type of server-side software, there will be strict limits on<br>
the range and complexity of dynamic content.  About the most you could do<br>
with the Java applets would amount to eye candy.  For the really ambitious,<br>
it would be possible to get around this via cleverly designed CGIs and Java,<br>
but the performance would be poor and significantly limited in scope.<br>
<p>
2) You cannot coordinate communication between many different clients<br>
without a server to coordinate them.  This not a technological problem but a<br>
theoretical problem.  It is difficult for randomly addressed clients to<br>
locate other randomly addressed clients on a network.  This is especially<br>
true when you have a network as big as the Internet.  This is why there<br>
exists such a beast as the "chat server".<br>
<p>
There aren't really that many technological limitations to this project.<br>
Most of the limitations I have been discussing are limitations inherent to<br>
the nature of the technology.  These limitations must be appropriately<br>
addressed if you really intend to accomplish anything.  If properly<br>
addressed, these limitations would become minor.  Refusing to address these<br>
issues will only cause trouble in the long term, especially when you hit the<br>
limits they impose.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What I want to see personally is a tightly integrated environment that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;everything the Internet wishes it was.  I want to see creative landscapes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and artistic design mixed with person-to-person interaction.  No one should</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be restricted from doing what they want, but it should be under the auspices</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of a larger plan.  I don't see where these concepts are necessarily mutually</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;exclusive.  Architecture and design is important if you want this world to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be able to handle more than a dozen simultaneous users.  You can't throw all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the technical and design issues out the window for the sake of convenience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;A chaotic software system is neither scalable nor particularly extensible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So we'll create a standard java applet for communcation! Just say if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;want avatars add this applet and people will because people want</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction. Besides we can change any of this as we go along. If we all</i><br>
<i>&gt;stick to standard off the shelf products we won't run into deadends because</i><br>
<i>&gt;there will always be some sort of file conversion utility and if we use</i><br>
<i>&gt;standard platform-independent file formats we can easily move them from one</i><br>
<i>&gt;server to another and upgrade the hardware as necessary.</i><br>
<p>
As mentioned above, inter-client communication *requires* server-side<br>
software.  This cannot be avoided.  The vast majority of the components and<br>
software used will be off-the-shelf.  But I have rarely built an<br>
interactive, data heavy site that didn't require at least *some* custom<br>
client/server software.  This may seem complicated to you, but this is the<br>
way the technology is extended.  It really isn't that difficult.  From the<br>
standpoint of people building worlds, you probably won't even notice that<br>
there is a custom component behind it.  You would use VRML et al the same as<br>
you always did.  At worst, you may be required to use our own set of Java<br>
communications/interaction objects instead of the default ones, but even<br>
this should be very trivial to the people who have to program using them.<br>
In fact, this may simplify the Java code significantly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;And just as a note on 56kbps modems:  They won't work with every service</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;provider.  The modems assume that the ISP is using a PRI telco connection</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(which is the case many times) and not one of the myriad of other options.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If the ISP is using a PRI, then the 56kbps modem establishes a 1B quasi-ISDN</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;connection to the ISP over standard phone lines.  If the ISP uses any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;type of telco connection, you are stuck using the same slow speeds you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;always did.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fortunetly USR has a monopoly on this scene so most of us will come through</i><br>
<i>&gt;ok. Can't satisfy everyone unfortunetly but thats the way it is. Most of us</i><br>
<i>&gt;won't be able to run it as well until we all upgrade to Pentium MMX</i><br>
<i>&gt;200mhzs. :)</i><br>
<p>
The compatibility issues isn't with the hardware, but with the types of<br>
telco connections used.  However, a large percentage of ISPs use the<br>
appropriate types of telco connections, so you probably won't have a problem.<br>
