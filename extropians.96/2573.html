<i>&gt;  Does that mean they should be ground up by the wheels of the capitalist </i><br>
<i>&gt;  machine? &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Capitalism lets people free themselves from geography by creating means to</i><br>
<i>&gt; move and choose where you want to go.  I don't know of any capitalistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; society that forbids travel or even travel out of the capitalistic society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I do however know that socialistic governments place travel restrictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; even within their own borders.  In this way a capitalistic society is closer</i><br>
<i>&gt; to libertarianism than a socialistic government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; People born handicapped were killed in the (very socialistic) USSR and Nazi a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Germany.  I don't know of any capitalistic government that has ever done</i><br>
<i>&gt; that.  I fact there are many non-government groups in capitalistic countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; that help the poor, handicapped, jobless, homeless.  I see no reason to go</i><br>
<i>&gt; back to a socialistic government where those private groups are outlawed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; only the government rules.  I don't see charities decreasing in capitalistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries and see no reason why they would decrease in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian-capitalist society.</i><br>
<p>
Point of Misinformation: Again I have to say that socialistic does not<br>
mean totalitarian. The Nazis were not socialists. you'll notice that among<br>
the people lumped in the death camps were the communists, who hitler<br>
feared, because of his links to the industrialists.<br>
<p>
A state sponsored capitalism is even worse than unrestricted capitalism.<br>
Like we have here, where the government health care system is at the mercy<br>
of pharmaceutical companies price increase. The companies know they can<br>
increase the price of equipment as much as they want and the governemnt<br>
will soak it up. Same thing with the pentagon: guaranteed state market.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have seen people "ground" into submission by governments but they always</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to be the socialist governments.  Socialist governments want all people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be equal, equally poor, starving, no rich at all.  The only exception I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen is the Swiss were everyone is equally rich. They don't let anyone enter</i><br>
<i>&gt; their country and become a citizen that is poor.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't want that. Look at socialist democracies. They work fine. There is<br>
no oppression, but there are taxes. It's not the best system, but within a<br>
market economy, it's working fairly well. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Centralized government or centralized business is a great problem.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; either gets too much power the people can not negotiate a free and prosperous</i><br>
<i>&gt; life.  Perhaps you are talking about "centralized (business monopoly)</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism".  If so, we agree on that one point, at least.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I love competition. The thought of netscape and microsoft going head to<br>
head over who develops the best product is great, because nobody is<br>
getting crushed in the process, and I get (depending on who wins) better<br>
software. But with multinationals, and monopolies, this spirit of free <br>
trade and beneficial competition goes out the window.<br>
 With unrestricted capitalism, I think you'll get monopolies happening<br>
faster than ever, simply because unethical corporations are not punished,<br>
as thus can do whatever they want to get ahead. Then one corporation will<br>
be nastier, make more money, and be able to purchase all the other ones.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;Libertarianism would work if everybody could compete on fair </i><br>
<i>&gt;  terms, &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Decentralization helps because it lets people negotiate their choices with</i><br>
<i>&gt; many different other people.  The central authority does not control.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't like the people you are dealing with, go to the next one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That would be great!! But I have a feeling there won't be a next one. I<br>
think you'll get a situation much like the last century, where workers<br>
were ill-treated, and the merchants did whatever they could to further<br>
profits, regardless of the human impact it had.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;but they can't, so some are going to lose all the time. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Some people will lose all the time" to me is a meaningless statement.  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people we call "just plain losers".  Some people are lazy, stupid or</i><br>
<i>&gt; uneducated.  And, some people will not help themselves no matter what you do</i><br>
<i>&gt; for them. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes, I don't want to coerce anyone into being rich!!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some people will not choose to help themselves no matter what you give them</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make things equal.  Equality is not a stable state if people choose to</i><br>
<i>&gt; work harder than other people.  Soon they gain the fruits of their labor and</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything is unequal again (poorer vs. richer).  If one person learns more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the next. . . you no longer have intellectual equality (educated vs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; uneducated).   China tried this and the educated scientists cleaned toilets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Did the uneducated make a new scientific discoveries?  You should not force</i><br>
<i>&gt; equality anymore than you force people to do anything else.  China had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; disaster when they tried. They chose to stop the "inequality" of intellect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Ironically they got an _Atlas Shrugged_Ayn Rand disaster of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; making.      </i><br>
<p>
But everybody should have the same opportunity. I would like everybody to<br>
have the same chances offered to them to be rich as anybody else. If they<br>
refuse it, fine, but they should have the chance. Yes, having scientists<br>
clean toilets exclusively is bad, but rotating the menial jobs about, so<br>
the scientist has to clean a toilet a week, isn't.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Equality is not the answer.  It's too unstable.  The minute everything is</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal, things change and the society spontaneously drifts out of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; unstable state.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes, rigid equality is grotesque. I just picture Zamyatin's We. What I<br>
want is equal opportunity. This isn't offered in capitalism because the<br>
capital is held by others, who wouldn't  give it to you because they don't<br>
like you. Your idea may be profitable and great, but if you speak up<br>
against those who finance these things, you'll go down. <br>
