<i>&gt; If an agency like the NSA were to do as Lyle claims,</i><br>

<i>&gt; house that would shoot to kill any federal agent if such a state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; affairs were to occur.  </i><br>
<p>
Do these people know each other?  Are they organized?  Do they know <br>
who the federal agents are in that area, and where they live?  Do your <br>
revolutionaries know more about the agents than the agents know about <br>
them?  <br>
<p>
If you shoot one federal agent, you have to fight them all.  Is the <br>
reverse true?  If an FBI agent shoots one of your people, with the others <br>
come to his defense?  Did anyone come to Randy Weaver's defense?  <br>

<p>
No, that's not all it takes.  Far from it.  <br>

<i>&gt; The Second American Civil War is already well under way.  </i><br>
<p>
Calling the War on Drugs a "Civil War" is merely a figure of speech, <br>
and I don't think it helps us to understand what's going on.  This "war" <br>
is totally one-sided.  The drug dealers and growers aren't fighting back.  <br>
Nor will they ever fight back; nor would the public rally to their cause <br>
if they tried.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The war is one waged upon peaceful, innocent civilians by </i><br>
<i>&gt; powerlusting warmongers.  </i><br>
<p>
My experience of drug dealers, including pot dealers, has been rather <br>
poor.  I think they are treated like criminals because most of them <br>
act like criminals.  Their neighbors (and even their customers) don't <br>
generally regard them as "peaceful, innocent civilians."  There are <br>
exceptions to this, of course.  <br>
<p>
There is no organized body of men in America capable of conducting <br>
a civil war.  Nor is there any ideology (or "meme") capable of creating <br>
an organized fighting force.  As long as the economy remains strong, <br>
I don't think this situation will change.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The profound insanity of the War on Drugs is becoming more </i><br>
<i>&gt; apparant every day, and I believe it is only a matter of time until </i><br>
<i>&gt; the majority of Americans come to a full realization of the atrocities </i><br>
<i>&gt; committed in their own neighborhoods and begin to adamantly refuse </i><br>
<i>&gt; to finance such violence with their taxes.  It is in our interest to </i><br>
<i>&gt; inform others of the real situation, so that a quick end is brought to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the nightmare we call 'The War on Drugs'.  </i><br>
<p>
Ok, I agree with that.  But first we have to understand what the <br>
real situation is.  When we use the term "Civil War" in this context <br>
we merely confuse ourselves.  <br>
<p>
One step (among many) toward understanding the real situation is to <br>
stop using the term "War."  That's their word, not ours.  It isn't a war, <br>
it's something else.   The expression "War on Drugs" was coined by <br>
Lyndon LaRouche in the 1970s.  He published a magazine with that <br>
title for a couple of years.  Then the Reagan administration adopted the <br>
term, and it has been a national obsession ever since.   <br>
<p>
Words like "insanity," "atrocities," and "nightmare" are accurate as far <br>
as they go, but such words don't tell us much about the nature and <br>
etiology of the War on Drugs.  As with most things, you can't get a <br>
handle on this until you understand it in terms of cause and effect.   <br>
Rhetoric is not helpful.  <br>
