<p>
	This is a piece from Dostoevsky, found in "The Idiot":<br>
<p>
	There was always one instant just before the epileptic fit...when<br>
suddenly in the midst of sadness, spiritual darkness and oppression, his<br>
brain seemed momentarily to catch fire, and in an extraordinary rush, all<br>
his vital forces were at their highest tension.  The sense of life, the<br>
consciousness of self, were multiplied almost ten times at these moments<br>
which lasted no longer than a flash of lightning.  His mind and his heart<br>
were flooded with extraordinary light;  all his uneasiness, all his<br>
doubts, all his anxieties were relieved at once;  they were all resolved<br>
into a lofty calm, full of serene, harmonious in joy and hope, full of<br>
reason and ultimate meaning.  But these moments, these flashes, were only<br>
a premonition of that final second (it was never more than a second) with<br>
which the fit began.  That second was, of course, unendurable.  Thinking<br>
of that moment later, when he was well again, he often said to himself<br>
that all these gleams and flashes of supreme sensation and consciousness<br>
of self, and, therefore, also of the highest form of being, were nothing<br>
but disease, the violation of the normal state;  and if so, it was not at<br>
all the highest form of being, but on the contrary must be reckoned the<br>
lowest.  Yet he came at last to an extremely paradoxical conclusion.<br>
"What if it is disease?" he decided at last.  "What does it matter that it<br>
is an abnormal intensity, if the result, if the instant of sensation,<br>
remembered and analyzed afterwords in health, turns out to be the acme of<br>
harmony and beauty, and gives a feeling, unknown and undivined until then,<br>
of completeness, of proportion, of reconciliation, and of startled<br>
prayerful merging with the highest synthesis of life?"<br>
