My guess is that beside the obvious uses for high-performance computing,<br>
molecular modelling (there are many obvious nanotech applications for<br>
this, and it might provide a strong impetus to develop nanotech just to be<br>
able to build good quantum computers) and code cracking, I think the truly<br>
awesome application might be AI. I haven't got the faintest idea of how to<br>
implement AI in a quantum computer, but I think it could be tremendously<br>
more efficient than on a conventional computer.  Hmm, I wonder what<br>
happens if we move to quantum neural networks... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of the following is a rehash of stuff I sent to the list  </i><br>

<p>
Hmm, maybe this is a good time for us to do this on other subjects too? A <br>
kind of 'end-of-the-year' summary for all of us?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It gets even wilder, because the quantum mechanical state of the matter in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the machine's memory determines the output, Seth Lloyd of MIT thinks you </i><br>
<i>&gt; could run the machine in reverse, feed in information and change the state </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the memory,  the result would be a quantum mechanical micromanipulator.</i><br>
<p>
But it might be a rather limited micromanipulator, since most likely the <br>
state will be stored as electron spins or atomic excitations, not <br>
anything like molecular structures. Still, it might form an useful <br>
interface to nanotech. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find all this very exciting, it must have been like this in the late 1930's </i><br>
<i>&gt; when reports trickled in about nuclear fission and the idea occurred to </i><br>
<i>&gt; people that a bizarre device like a nuclear bomb might actually be able to </i><br>
<i>&gt; exist in the real world.</i><br>
<p>
And in neuroscience, more and more people are beginning to think that <br>
neural interfaces are a possibility... Happy new year!<br>
