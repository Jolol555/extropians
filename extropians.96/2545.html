<p>
There are still people out there who can't afford toothbrushes, but <br>
that's a different story. The average standard of living has improved, <br>
but the average poor person lives in much the same way they did 200 years <br>
ago, with a few more perks. While the rich standard of living has <br>
increase, say , by a hundred fold, the poor standard of living has <br>
increased maybe three fold.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: If people share your fear, nobody will get that many votes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They can only "impose their will" once they start to buy up all the </i><br>
<i>&gt; land.  Buying off and then growing the govt is the logical course </i><br>
<i>&gt; to take, and the most effective pretext for growth is socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So the logical course is anti-socailism, or laissez faire.</i><br>
<p>
Look at a company like Shell. They give us nice products like oil, right?<br>
They get it at the expense of people who can't afford to buy any of it. <br>
THe Ogoni in Nigeria. Yet, because they have our economic support, they <br>
don't need anybody else's. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Your saying that capitalism will lead to either [1] socialism</i><br>
<i>&gt; or [2] socialism so we would be better off with socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The fact is that both varieties of socialism you fear -- both </i><br>
<i>&gt; rule by a central cabal -- are achieved only by means antithetical </i><br>
<i>&gt; to capitalism, so there is a clear path: laissez faire.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
How will laissez faire prevent those things from happening? Either the <br>
workers and the poor, of which there will be far more, will revolt as <br>
Marx predicted. Or the powerful will have such control that the <br>
peop[le won't be able to revolt. Laissez faire will not move wealth <br>
around. It will centralize it into the hands of the most ruthless or capable.<br>
<p>
<p>
Socialism does not imply totalitarianism. It's completely different. <br>
Batista, Duvalier, Suharto, and Duarte all ran with capitalism, and yet <br>
they were, (still are in the case of Suharto), completely totalitarian. <br>
This is because the government was run for and by the private interests. <br>
Which is what I think happens with laissez faire.<br>
<p>
I live in Canada, which is a fairly good  liberal socialism. I agree with <br>
Banjo that capitalism needs a bit of government in order to keep it from <br>
running amuck.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Why is an utopia illogical? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: If its goal -- equalization of wealth -- violate it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; tenants -- liberty -- as in the case of "anarcho-socialism,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; then it's illogical.</i><br>
<p>
But it doesn't. The freedom to do what you choose is still there, but of <br>
course there are limits, because then you impinge on the freedom of <br>
others. There is more freedom than capitalism because noone can tell you <br>
what to do (with you having to take it, with no reasonable alternatives). <br>
There is also mroe equality. Of course it's not a perfect system. But I'd <br>
like a system that is flexible enough to meet the problems it runs into <br>
without too much bureaucratic  procrastination. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I'm advocating voluntary socialism, pretty much. No I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; impose this by force, because that's just not right. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: So you disagree with Chomsky when we says we need the federal govt?</i><br>
<p>
Well, no. Because the business interests have so much power, i think we <br>
need to get a strong populist government. The emphasis on the word <br>
populist. It's a neccessary evil to counteract another evil. <br>
