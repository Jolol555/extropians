In a message dated 96-08-22 06:49:03 EDT, ' gene was seen to write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 I think the only (and unintended at that) offense you might raise is that <br>
 of keeping (potentially embryonic &gt;H) people from discussing more technical <br>
 questions.<br>
<p>
Ok fellow embryo!  ; - )<br>
<p>
    How can intermittent interest in one subject *keep* one from talking<br>
about another?  It just provides another channel. Even sex isnt that<br>
fascinating that we would drop  everything else and only debate *it*.<br>
     Ok, sex is distracting -  even stops productive minds -at least<br>
sometimes. For some this is a welcome recreational break.But artists have<br>
notoriuosly high libidos,  so maybe hardscience minds dont really need<br>
it....but I find lack of sex far more distracting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Our mental resources ain't that plentiful to allow us  squandering 'em. </i><br>
<p>
Hey! : - ) Speak for yourself re: resources, mental or otherwise!  : - ) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I am quite astonished as to the low percentile  transhumanist technology</i><br>
discussion scores in the extropians mailing list.  I know these things are<br>
highly nonlinear in time, yet it still unsettles me  somewhat...<br>
<p>
If discussion of issues untechnical unsettles you, you could make a special,<br>
    <br>
hitech,  &gt;Htech list. People have suggested specific lists for<br>
specific-topics-only views. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I observe that, like emotions, people will tend to view Sex as</i><br>
noncognitive,<br>
<i> &gt; or "not an issue" with brain developement ( strange because most primates</i><br>
I<br>
<i> &gt; know spend a high perecentage of their brain energy trying to find it or</i><br>
<i> &gt; thinking about it) - A friend of mine returned from a week long conference</i><br>
on<br>
 <br>
( 'gene)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; There is nothing strange about this obsession with sex: all organisms are</i><br>
evolutionary artefacted.<br>
<p>
      NO NO - you missed my point, of course I meant it is strange that a<br>
whole conference on consciousness ignored it's existence. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, the hardwired "propagate, propagate, propagate" programme does </i><br>
 often inhibit other functions, in humans mostly ratio. An (otherwise <br>
 quite boring) <br>
<p>
     ( : - 0    You think sex is boring? Wow.sheesh, i have absolutely NO<br>
reference point for that one. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;physical act aquires a certain glorious aura, this also </i><br>
 happens to the perception of mate/offspring. Remember the last endorphin <br>
 high you rode when enamoured? Peek-a-boo -- ain't that one cute little <br>
 dude?<br>
 <br>
   Hmmm.......     I do not get the jist of the metaphor here. Our<br>
experiential referencing is too disparate. However I will point out that,<br>
seeing Transhumanists as immortalists, sex for the means of propogation is<br>
not the phenomenon I am referring to of course, but consciousness pleasure-<br>
 including but not limited to -the endorphins, yes.<br>
[and as Eric pointed out the experiental factor - interaction between two<br>
beings on a very lovely level)<br>
So, obviously sex expedites &lt;H evolution but that is not what we are<br>
discussing here -  I for one, see my own &gt;H future as being highly<br>
pleasurable as WELL as productive. <br>
I want to soar in ecstasy as well as knowledge and creativity.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The function itself is certainly ancient. Bacteria fuck (E.coli S+/-), </i><br>
<p>
EEEK !!!!!! bacteria do WHAT? oh....ok, thats one way to put it (blush)<br>
But do they enjoy it on a conscious level? Is that highly relative to<br>
cognitive functions of the human brain?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; polypes copulate, insects do it, too. The only thing of interest sex has </i><br>
 to it is the highly selective methods the evolutionary older brain <br>
 regions utilizes to manipulate the younger reagions. Neat trick, that. <br>
 This topics is interesting indeed, and should not be banned. Importance <br>
 of supressed olfactory data (MHC fragments) to mate selection &amp; the <br>
 influence of oral contraceptiva upon it. Heard about that one? Neato.<br>
<p>
No. Do tell! Olfactory means smells, the quckest way to the old brain, yes?<br>
You must tell me more... <br>
Smellipulation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; As Anders has once said: why not wiring the reward centre to some other,</i><br>
<i> &gt;constructive tasks? I hope I am not preaching askesis here, but devoting </i><br>
<i> &gt;an unnecessary amount of bandwidth + giving the subject much too much </i><br>
<i> &gt;glamour (highest bandwidth communication? Only as mb/s transfer rate </i><br>
<i>&gt; is involved. The same 4 mbases every time, with negligeable alterations. </i><br>
<i> &gt;Boooring.)</i><br>
<p>
You find it boring?  And the same each time? ( scratching head) Well&lt; i had<br>
to ask for this megabyte bit to be translated out of technospeak, but I get<br>
your jist - sex won't get us to the moon. Ok, so that is the reason why we<br>
would not want to spend every minute of our lives on it<br>
<p>
Dont equate the glamour aspect with the pleasure aspect, or the marketing<br>
 value of sex with the actual function of it - not really purely biological,<br>
but a happy addition to optimal lives ( since we are still talkng about human<br>
consciousness). Yes, it would be nice if " A not A " did give me a rosy<br>
endorphin high, I would have probably spent a lot more time in calculus. <br>
However I think you are still underestimating the brain by giving it limits<br>
on "bandwidth" that come anywhere NEAR to making it neccessary to eliminate<br>
sexual thought or pleasure stimuli in order to concentrate on technical<br>
advances ( this would also mean we have to quit vacationing and  whole lot of<br>
wonderful and creative adventures).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Replication in a limited environment (solid state mind ecosphere) is </i><br>
 bound to be limited (orelse we have to contemplate upon admitting the <br>
 Reaper in again, which imo is a Bad Idea), and, if not de novo would <br>
 create a chimaeric structure from several contributors. You can wire your <br>
 reward centre to it,<br>
<p>
<p>
This lat was over my head, 'gene - What do you mean by replicating? AI<br>
self-propogation? Your technospeak baffles me. Why must we then bring the<br>
reaper in?  Bandwidth again? What is a chimaeric structure?? Do you think in<br>
terms of hardware orgasms? BTW The reason age French used to call the orgasm<br>
" le petit mort" ..."the little death"... refering to that  state of<br>
consciousness of pure bliss, which gave one a temporary sense of<br>
"nothingness" - a sense of losing the self...which in humans probably<br>
facilitates that famous release from the tension - mental and physical, and<br>
is one of the best effects of sex itself ..if one assumes the reward center<br>
of AI would not need a break from it's busy calculations, nor be attuned to a<br>
set of neural and muscular prompts - this could be seen as  a strictly<br>
wetware debate perhaps. Hard to imagine uploads having ANY sex or gender<br>
anyway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but why bothering?</i><br>
<p>
That brings up the "fundamental differences" topic again. Why indeed? ( BTW<br>
If one doesnt *enjoy* sex, finds it boring or whatever then certainly one<br>
shouldnt do it). But more to the point:  What is one's reason for being a<br>
transhumanist? If it is to enhance one's own existnce, then perhaps playing<br>
about with ways of enhanced pleasure, stimulation ie:  rewards ( as in the<br>
rewiring of pleasure to say, enhanced productivity - faster learning or<br>
whatever) will be desirable. Similarly if you only want to spend your time<br>
and energy on technology and productivity,then  it is a waste of time. <br>
          If one's goal is to bring on the Singularity, or to become an AI,<br>
or simply think current humans won't actually be transhuman but should strive<br>
and sacrifice this life to the common good then pleasure and good feeling may<br>
be indeed pointless!   <br>
