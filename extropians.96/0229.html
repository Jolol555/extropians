<p>
I strongly second Robin's suggestion for a volunteer to gather the material<br>
and secure permissions. Actually, more than one volunteer would help. One<br>
person should be the coordinator and main archivist, but others can help<br>
with tracking down current addresses of past contributors to ask their<br>
permission to publically archive their posts, and posts that quote them. For<br>
really good posts that quote people who can't be tracked down, I suppose we<br>
can simply cut out the quotations. This will leave some messages slightly<br>
puzzling, but may still be worthwhile.<br>

<i>&gt;I have many megs of private archives, and don't think you all want me</i><br>

I have almost all the postings to the Extropians list for the five years of<br>
its existence. They mostly reside on floppies, but will soon be placed on a=<br>
 Zip.<br>
