I read sometime ago in Popular Science (SEPT. 95 ISSUE) about a military<br>
technology being developed in Alaska called High-Frequency Active Auroral<br>
Research Program (HAARP)in which you could create artificial satellites that<br>
you could bounce signals off of by heating sections of the atmosphere with a<br>
highly focused radiowave beam. PS also meantioned the ability for<br>
manipulating local weather (now I assume this would be by heating sections<br>
of the atmosphere in patterns to move moisture around). This HAARP<br>
technology is also in it's infancy so could it be possible that with a few<br>
breakthroughs in increasing the power of the highly focused radiowave beam<br>
that we could ultimately control global climate? Technology like this could<br>
be used for the benefit of mankind by dissolving hurricanes before they make<br>
contact with coastlines or moving rain clouds into drought areas. Can we<br>
forsee ourselves manipulating global climate in, lets say the next 20 years?<br>
Saving millions of dollars and thousands of lives?<br>
