It might be wise to read an entire post before you comment on it. I'll give  <br>
you the Readers Digest Condensed Version, the main theme of my post was that  <br>
the free market is NOT perfect, just the best instrument we have. The correct  <br>
price for a mass market object is the maximum amount that most people are <br>
willing to pay for it. If this price is less than the cost to manufacture and <br>
distribute it, then there is no point in making it at all, nobody wants it <br>
very badly. The market finds this price not by solving simultaneous equations <br>
but by experiment, with modern commutations it might not find the perfect <br>
price but it can come very close.<br>

In other words a society governed by the free market is not as good as one  <br>
lead by somebody who is infinitely wise, infinitely knowledgeable, and <br>
infinitely good. Well, I think that is perfectly true, the only trouble is, <br>
although  there are plenty of leaders who claim to posses these wonderful <br>
attributes, those who actually do in fact have these qualities are in rather<br>
short supply.   <br>

Capitalism yes, but few on this list have anything good to say about <br>
democracy, I certainly don't. And nobody want's to force you to do anything, <br>
all we ask is that you give us the same curtesy.<br>

Let's see, you don't want the state to have power, you don't want corporations  <br>
to have power, sound like you want a powerless wimpy civilization. Yes I know, <br>
you want the individual to have power, but until you spell out what that <br>
means  it's as vacuous as "power to the people".<br>

                  <br>
<p>
Sounds like you've been reading Brian Arthur. His idea of "increasing returns" <br>
is that positive feedback can be important in economics, small things can  <br>
lead to huge changes, and popularity alone can lead to even more popularity.  <br>
For example, a century ago for no very good reason, somebody made a QWERTY <br>
typewriter and today nearly every keyboard on the planet is a QWERTY, even  <br>
though it is not the most efficient layout. I think Arthur is a very bright  <br>
fellow and his increasing returns idea has a lot of validity, but I part  <br>
company with him when he uses it to justify government regulation.<br>
                  <br>
His argument boils down to 2 things, the free market is not perfect and <br>
standards are hard to change. Both points are true but neither can justify <br>
Big Brother using coercion to stop the Microsoft\Intuit  merger, as he <br>
maintains. I agree that the free market is not perfect, but then, perfection <br>
never enters into the realm of real world economics, regulators are not <br>
perfect either. And yes, it's difficult to tell when the time is right to <br>
change a standard, and yes, politicians are not nearly smart enough to make <br>
that decision.                        <br>
                  <br>
<i>                &gt;The spread of MicroSoft software is much like the spread of                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;a foreign bacterium in the human body.  A healthy body has                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;an immune system which keeps any substance (internal or                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;external) from rising to an excessive level. One can imagine   </i><br>
<i>                &gt;a social system which had similar internal, self-organizing                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;mechanisms acting to keep things decentralized</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I don't understand what prevents this mysterious regulatory mechanism from  <br>
falling victim to the same "increasing returns" and "positive feedback" you  <br>
so fear, especially when you consider that even at the start it MUST be more  <br>
powerful than Microsoft if it is to have any hope of regulating it.<br>
