<i>&gt;global climate control, new space tech such as the roton and methods</i><br>

<i>&gt;page and we concentrate on 5-10% of them? Sure the big three extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;topics are the most important but we *NEED* variety.</i><br>
<p>
Personally I am much more interested in getting deep enough into some<br>
topic to actually make some new intellectual progress, rather than<br>
briefly touching on hundreds of topics (workshop vs. party mode).  We<br>
still don't understand very much about the favorite topics, and they<br>
are well worth getting right.  They are hardly played-out territory.<br>
<p>
But then I am more of an academic, who doesn't think you really<br>
understand a topic until you can make original contributions to it,<br>
and who doesn't think you've made a contribution until it can stand up<br>
to detailed criticism.  Of course you don't have to share my<br>
preferences, but then neither do I have to share yours.<br>
