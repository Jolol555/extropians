Hi folks<br>
<p>
Max More recently posted a reply concerning the publication delay for Hans<br>
Moravec's MIND AGE, the sequel to MIND CHILDREN.  An error crept into his<br>
account, and Hans has asked me to post the correction.  He writes:  <br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
I think Max More<br>
incorrectly data compressed my too-long description.  Actually<br>
Oxford has been the saint in the saga of my book, the villain was<br>
Bantam Books.  The too-long story follows, maybe you could post<br>
it to correct Max's misimpression [snip]<br>
<p>
In 1992 I signed a contract with Bantam Books for the Mind Children sequel.<br>
Everything was going fine, I had received 2/3 of the advance as my manuscript<br>
took form.  Then suddenly in 1994, an awkward letter for my editor<br>
explained that my manuscript was incomprehensible and unpublishable, and<br>
immediately thereafter a Bantam lawyer demanded the advance back.<br>
<p>
I quickly learned that the same thing had simultaneously happened to at<br>
least dozens of other writers, including people like Gregory Benford and<br>
Murray Gell Mann. Bantam, along with Doubleday and Dell had been absorbed<br>
into German publishing conglomerate Bertelsmann, and downsized, dropping<br>
lots of editors (including mine) and their projects.  They exerted<br>
their legal muscle to intimidate writers to get their money back without<br>
contract-breaking penalties.  Most quickly found other publishers, and<br>
gave in to BDD to unencumber their rights.  It took me longer to get a<br>
very supportive offer from Oxford.  In the interim I had such<br>
unpleasant interactions with the Bantam lawyer that it became intolerable<br>
to me to give in to their original (extortionate) terms.  I offered a<br>
very protracted paback based on a fraction of the royalties from a new<br>
publisher, but they held out until finally (in September) I threatened<br>
to simply put the MS on the Web, reducing their probability of any payback<br>
to near zero.  The standoff delayed the book by at least two years, during<br>
which Oxford (also my German publisher Hoffmann und Campe) patiently waited.<br>
<p>
---------------------------------<br>
<p>
Noting that Hans's future post-Spike intelligences are dubbed Exes<br>
(Ex-human, ex-corporation, ex-traterrestrial), I wish you all a belated<br>
happy Ex-mas!<br>
