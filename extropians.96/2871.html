<i>&gt; &gt;IAN: Of course, as facts prove, you require ad hominem to</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have argued from the beginning that we should stick to facts and logic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is one thing to suggest the *possibility* TWA Flight 800 was brought</i><br>
<i>&gt; down by a Navy missile.  It is another thing to *announce* that is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; happened -- which is precisely what a couple messages reposted to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; forum did.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I never ruled out the possibility of a missile.  However, the cover-up</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory as presented is absurd.  It suggested the complicity of an entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; crew of a Navy destroyer, multiple gov't agencies, and the White House.  </i><br>
<p>
We know for one that this particular White House is capable of covering<br>
up ANYTHING that will preserve its power. We also know that multiple<br>
government agencies which work under the blanket of secrecy everyday do<br>
know how to keep a secret (SR-71 for ten years, the Stealth Fighter for<br>
more than ten years, as well as some things you have no idea about yet). <br>
In addition, something you may not know anything about Ira, is that on<br>
Naval vessels, there are very few, if any portholes. ANything happening<br>
in one section of the ship, due to its armoring, and the noise of<br>
internal machinery, would be drowned out, and those individuals<br>
involved, the vast number of whome are of low rank, know that if they<br>
are given an order to shut up over something that gets classfied, they<br>
will easily die if they open their mouths. I know this due to my own<br>
experiences in the US Military. The phrase "we take care of our own" has<br>
many meanings, some of which are pretty insidious.<br>
I<br>
<i>&gt; just don't think they could pull it off if they tried.  Gov't employees</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't that competent.</i><br>
<p>
US military personnel are not your regular government employees.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, it was on the basis of questioning gov't and media that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggested Salinger was an unreliable source.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But look at how quickly you and others embraced Salinger's remarks and</i><br>
<i>&gt; proclaimed victory!  (Remember, you originally stated that Salinger's</i><br>
<i>&gt; comments "proved" it was a Navy missile.)  I don't know what brought down</i><br>
<i>&gt; TWA Flight 800.  The official investigation doesn't appear to know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; brought down TWA Flight 800.  What we should be skeptical about is people</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of miles removed, with possible political motivations, or an</i><br>
<i>&gt; affinity for conspiracy theories, making spectacular but unsubstantiated</i><br>
<i>&gt; pronouncemnets about "what really happened."</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmmm.  I distinguish between arguments based purely on appeal to authority</i><br>
<i>&gt; versus arguments that are supported by authoritative sources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Never questioning "authority" is one extreme.  Always condemning authority</i><br>
<i>&gt; is another.  In my universe, authority is generally earned, so in itself it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not bad.  There are abuses of authority.  But guess what?  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; even more abuses by people with only self-appointed "authority."</i><br>
<p>
you mean, things like the National Security Act of 1947?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you are in a position of authority and declare TWA Flight 800 was not,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your opinion, downed by a missile of any kind your assertion will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; questioned, doubted, and even contradicted twelve ways till Tuesday.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't see why the same shouldn't apply to uncredentialed conspiracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I've never said "the Navy did it." I believe 90% a missile did it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't have enough information to say it was or wasn't a missile, but I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasingly doubtful it was a missile fired by the U.S. Navy and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; covered up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you are right.  I tend to believe authorities in various fields</i><br>
<i>&gt; before I believe people who come out of nowhere with sensational stories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I also recognize the positive role that radical, "outside"</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinkers can play.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I notice, however, there are radical optimists and radical pessimists.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to pay more attention to the former.  In my view, people who come up</i><br>
<i>&gt; with potentially new and better ideas always deserve a hearing.  At some</i><br>
<i>&gt; point, on the other hand, people who continually tell us the truth isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; what it seems, but can never prove it, and argue that you are obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; naive or have been duped if you disagree with them, deserve to be tuned</i><br>
<i>&gt; out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;IAN: He's a scoundrel because he has documents the GovtMedia does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;like?? Forget the fact that these documents, if they are nothing more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than the internet document, have not, to my knwoledge, been disproven</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in any fashion other than that they were anonymous and that the USN</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;says, "we weren't there." If the authorities say X is true, then X</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is true and anyone who says otherwise is an "intellectually dis-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;honest scoundrel." I reject that thinking as servile.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; He's intellectually dishonest because he tried to take personal credit for</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "document" he never bothered to check out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes Ian, only a scoundrel would accuse other people of criminal behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then refuse to show the "proof."  This is called slander.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Where's your proof that the internet document is false? I just, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;last post, presented evidence that the key feature of disproving it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that area W-105 is not a missile testing area, is compromised by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;USN dude saying the area is "not typically used for missile training."</i><br>
<p>
This is another fallacy. All civil air navigation maps specifically warn<br>
aircraft from that area for that very reason. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;That does not prove the Navy did it, but it leaves the door open on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the validity of the document. So where's your assumed disproof?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not the one trying to prove what happened.  Admittedly, it strikes me</i><br>
<i>&gt; as more honest for a Navy official to leave the door open than for</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy theorists to say with certainty "here is what really happened."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I remain skeptical about the conspiracy theory.  I am less skeptical about</i><br>
<i>&gt; a widespread investigation that has not ruled out (last I heard) mechanical</i><br>
<i>&gt; failure, a terrorist bomb, or a missile.  It's the conspiracy theorists who</i><br>
<i>&gt; have already made up their minds and are arguing from emotion.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; official investigation admits it does not yet have enough facts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The facts are that mechanical failure of the sort necessary to have the<br>
failure that occured in that plane by itself has been determined to be<br>
fantastically unlikely. It is also a fact that they have only found bomb<br>
traces on sections of the plane where ordinances had been stored for<br>
shipment during Operation Desert Storm. THe traces they found were no<br>
where near that beleived needed to induce the blast the plane<br>
experienced. What is left?<br>
<p>
The fact that it is Navy vessels collecting the debris is like letting a<br>
crime suspect examine and collect the evidence at a crime scene.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This plane went down over the Atlantic Ocean.  Many of the "facts" have not</i><br>
<i>&gt; been recovered.  Maybe they never will.  It will probably take a systematic</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort by a large number of trained investigators to get the answer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ***Skeptics will trust those who are retrieving and examining the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical evidence before they trust those who insist they already know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; "really happened" because they have pieced it together from select media</i><br>
<i>&gt; reports.***</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Skeptics of what?<br>
