 do not obviously reduce to some some more fundamental thing that I want. <br>
 <br>
 Robin D. Hanson  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I have to agree with Robin here. Privacy should always be a matter of choice.<br>
<p>
It is fundamental to the scenario that most people are self protective and<br>
rightfully so. They need to be granted that individuality and choice. <br>
While I agree with Paul that one should be as comfortable with yourself as<br>
possible, and have great pride and not want to hide, or shun the light of<br>
day, I cannot say that one should give up one's personal privacy because you<br>
are confident of your own worth.... <br>
(it is others who are unworthy sometimes.)<br>
While I love my body immeasurably, it is not practical that I display it in<br>
front of most of the men I know. It does not suit my agenda to do so, and I<br>
am happy that I do not have to - i wouldnt want to deal with the response. <br>
In fact, it is precisely because I value it so highly that i reserve it for<br>
those that i trust and who i like very much. <br>
<p>
The issue of personal privacy is one of personal values.<br>
<p>
Is it a valuable thing to reserve yourself and protect yourself from outside<br>
influences and undesirable scrutiny? Is it a bit idealist to take the stance<br>
u take Paul?  I applaud your self responsibility and pride. Just yet it may<br>
not work  for everyone, although in a utopia it may be reasonably possible.<br>
But not in this world yet.<br>
<p>
It is one thing to take self responsibility if people around you also do so,<br>
but one should also be self aware to know that there aren't always the<br>
circumstances which warrant being open, honest and totally free..<br>
Maybe someday.... <br>
