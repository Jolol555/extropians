But it's not a simulation because there is nothing to simulate, in your  <br>
scenario God makes the universe to solve problems and make interesting  <br>
structures. I can't see any reason except perversity to start such a universe  <br>
at such a low level, not help us out when we get into serious trouble, and <br>
most important of all, not give us at the very start the inheritance of <br>
acquired characteristics. I'm no saint but I couldn't sleep at night if I  <br>
knew that generations of conscious beings were suffering horribly in my  <br>
laboratory.<br>

"God" would know the basic laws of physics in the world created by His <br>
computer, but that does NOT mean He "would necessarily have a complete  <br>
understanding of the entire workings of that simulation".  In the cellular  <br>
automation universe of the "Game of Life" the physics is very simple yet it <br>
creates extraordinary patterns of great complexity, and the only way to <br>
figure out what it will do next is to run it and see. You can learn the <br>
physics (rules) of Chess in a few minutes, and spend a lifetime learning just <br>
some of its  ramifications.<br>
                 <br>

<i>                &gt;&gt;working hypothesis.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Michael                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;What is the simplest theory that actually axplains             </i><br>
<i>                &gt;everything? If you have one, you deserve the Nobel, cause                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;I haven't heard it....</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
If I could explain EVERYTHING I would deserve far more than a Nobel, <br>
even conferring the title of "God" on me would be far too puny a tribute.                             <br>
<p>
As I said, we may only be the second, and our universe just a program running <br>
on a computer in a Meta universe someplace. But there is no reason to  stop <br>
there, this Meta universe could also be a program running in a computer in a <br>
Meta Meta universe, but no reason to stop there either. We end up with an <br>
infinite number of computers and universes, but somehow that doesn't seem<br>
very simple to me, and anyway it wouldn't help a bit with the biggest  <br>
unanswered question of all, Why is there something rather than nothing? <br>
<p>
I don't think the human mind is able to conceive of a more difficult question.  <br>
I have about as much chance of correctly answering that as pigs have of <br>
flying, so I will focus on a much simpler, though still very difficult  <br>
question. What general form would the answer have to be in for it to be <br>
satisfactory?  Clearly "the universe exists because it should" is not  <br>
satisfactory because it implies the existence of ethical laws and existence  <br>
is what we are trying to prove in the first place. The anthropomorphic answer  <br>
that  the universe must exist or we wouldn't be here to ask the question, <br>
is true but just begs the question, why are we here? Any answer in the form   <br>
"the universe  exists because of X " will never satisfy us because it  <br>
immediately suggests another very obvious unanswered  question.<br>
<p>
The only halfway adequate way to explain it is if it could be shown that  <br>
"nothing" was somehow self contradictory so there must be "something".  <br>
Needless to say I have no idea how to do this.  Even in this case however it  <br>
assumes the existence of logical laws,  such as the law forbidding  <br>
contradictions. Being logically self consistent doesn't prove a thing's  <br>
existence (Moravec would disagree), so why does being self inconsistent prove  <br>
it does not exist?  <br>
<p>
I love logic, I think its useful in solving all problems, except this one.  <br>
I don't know if the question even makes sense. The first word of this question  <br>
is "why" which means " what is the reason". Reason implies logic and logic is  <br>
something. So we are asked to find a logical reason for reality, but clearly  <br>
we can't use logic to find it, after all, that would  be illogical. This sort  <br>
of thing could give circular reasoning a bad name  because it's totally <br>
without  meaning.  <br>
<p>
Or is it?  All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those  <br>
words also have  definitions made of other words also in  the dictionary, <br>
and round and round we go. Is a  dictionary totally without meaning? <br>
I suppose that  all depends on what meaning means.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;Then why call this being "God"? You must know that it is                 </i><br>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;burdened with more baggage than any other word in the                 </i><br>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;English language.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;What? John, I thought you were the premier taboo buster                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;around these parts! Such preconceptions should not burden                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;you. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Preconceptions about words do burden me. When I use a familiar word in a <br>
unfamiliar way, I at least try to make that new meaning clear.  That's not to <br>
say that ambiguity and unusual uses of words don't have a place, but it's in <br>
Poetry not Science.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;We use the word "computer" everyday in ways completly                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;divorced from its original meaning (a job description for a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;person with a slide rule). </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, when I use the word "computer" it is divorced from its original meaning,  <br>
but not from its common meaning. My use of the word rarely causes confusion  <br>
because I did not make up a new meaning out of thin air. On the other hand,  <br>
if I said I went to Burger King, bought a computer, put some ketchup on it, <br>
and then ate it, people might be puzzled.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Creating a new  definition for God should be an easy step..</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, very easy, far, far, too easy. There are so many they have lost all  <br>
value. <br>
