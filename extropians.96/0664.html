<i>&gt; In response to de Vries:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;As I see it, immortalists can be divided into two groups: those who </i><br>
<i>&gt; want to live on through there current minds and/or bodies, and those </i><br>
<i>&gt; who don`t care how the "I" fits into the picture as long as the </i><br>
<i>&gt; descendants are "better" than the current version of "I".&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think we should be so *binary* in that judgment.  The extent to</i><br>
<i>&gt; which we are willing to change or evolve is much more of a continuum</i><br>
<i>&gt; or spectrum.  </i><br>
<p>
True, it does not have to be binary, rather to extreme ends of the <br>
spectrum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Partly because none of us can agree as to when we've</i><br>
<i>&gt; passed beyond the threshold of humanity.  I am interested in changing</i><br>
<i>&gt; and growing and evolving a great deal.  Yet I feel that I'm unwilling to give</i><br>
<i>&gt; up some basics of my humanity.  That might be conservative to some, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; radical to the majority.  I suppose it comes down to an individual judgment</i><br>
<i>&gt; of what is really "I" at the core.  I'm willing to give up this body, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example, but not yet willing to give up the human form.</i><br>
<p>
A contradiction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  But I'd like it to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; enhanced of course.  Where does that place me in the extropian values</i><br>
<i>&gt; spectrum?  I guess I have similar reservations about my mind.  (Don't take</i><br>
<i>&gt; that sentence out of context.)  I'd like it to be better informed, faster, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; "sub-contracted" with daemon sub-routines, but all this in pursuit of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; current identity, values, and goals structure.</i><br>
<p>
If you have changed your cognitive abilities, especially size and <br>
speed, it will be quite unlikely that you have the same values and <br>
definitely not the same identity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I guess I have a serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aesthetic Appreciation for some aspects of humanity and my own life. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Presently, I would want that to continue forever.  I thought the very point</i><br>
<i>&gt; of immortality was continuity of the self.  Continuity of life processes is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a variant of the life cycle.</i><br>
<p>
Please elaborate on the last statement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't just want better descendants, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; want a better self.  Maintaining a self absolutely requires some limits to</i><br>
<i>&gt; how far you are willing to let yourself change, or evolve.  I think those</i><br>
<i>&gt; limits are probably different for each of us.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  If you are growing continously, the only thing that the <br>
remains constant is the act of growing.  This is exaclty why I hold <br>
that "I" is a process, not a thing.<br>
