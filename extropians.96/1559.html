That humans can destroy them more efficiently than they can reproduce.<br>
<p>
That humans don't try to hunt them down (they are simply not important <br>
enough), and they live more or less independently. <br>
<p>
That they realize they can profit more from living as scavengers or <br>
consultants to the humans.<br>
<p>
See the galactic centre novels by Benford for some ideas along these<br>
lines, although it is hard to say if the humans or the mechs are the<br>
pagets. I strongly recommend those books, they have plenty of transhuman <br>
ideas (uploads used as expert systems, neural enhancements, megascale <br>
engineering, alien and artificial civilizations and what looks like <br>
cosmic re-engineering). <br>
