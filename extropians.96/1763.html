How is the progress on Augmented Reality going aka Enhanced Reality (where<br>
you slap on a pair of transparent headmounted displays and walk around with<br>
digital images superimposed over real world objects)? I recently read in the<br>
LA Times that they're putting virtual ads superimposed over sports games<br>
such as tennis. The people in the stands see nothing but the people watching<br>
it on TV see the ad as though it is painted on the wall or floor. Imagine<br>
eventually seeing colored animated logos in the grass on the field during a<br>
football game! Strange indeed to see the grass move for the animated logo or<br>
thats what it would appear as. I truely wonder how far off the Snow Crash<br>
'metaverse' after seeing Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 and how long before we can<br>
have virtual ads appear everywhere. We will experience impossible virtual<br>
feats long before nano or uploading. I just wonder how long? Imagine sitting<br>
in your living room wearing augmented reality contacts or glasses and<br>
speaking 'menu' and having a menu popup in front of you and being able to<br>
select what texture you wish to wrap your wooden stairway with. You select<br>
black slick marble and suddenly your stairway appears to be made of marble.<br>
Or perhaps you want your window to be a hawaiian beachfront view. Not a<br>
problem. Perhaps it's christmas but your child's grandparents wanted to be<br>
their on christmas morning when your child opened all his/her gifts? Easily<br>
done, the grandparents could be superimposed anywhere in the living room and<br>
could walk around freely. They would appear as though they were there and it<br>
would appear to them as if they were there also because they would<br>
experience your living room though telepresence.<br>
