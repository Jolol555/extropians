There's a game called 'TCS', or 'Trillion Credit Squadron'. It began as a<br>
paper game that I played at school, where people used some rules to design<br>
a fleet of starships (of total cost one trillion 'credits', hence the<br>
name) and then battled against each other to see which fleet would win. In<br>
the late eighties someone wrote a program which allowed a Mac to play;<br>
this software is fairly well documented (at least one magazine article and<br>
one chapter of an AI book). The Mac played games against itself for a long<br>
time and then joined the world TCS championship. Two years in a row it<br>
beat all human competitors, then it was banned. <br>
<p>
However, the important point is this: there is a loophole in the TCS<br>
rules; each turn the player whose slowest starship is faster shoots first.<br>
The Mac discovered this and utilised it by, when neccesary, destroying its<br>
own slowest starships to ensure that its fleet shot first. To my knowledge<br>
no human player had ever used this tactic until the Mac discovered it. <br>
<p>
Is this creative or not? If not, then can we write off all prior human<br>
players as uncreative? Certainly I never discovered this tactic, so am I<br>
less creative than 68020 Mac? Or is this whole "creativity" thing just an<br>
example of "materialism" (i.e. carbon vs silicon)? <br>

P.S. Is there a recognized word for artificial discrimination against <br>
silicon-based life forms?<br>
