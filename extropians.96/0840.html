Oh boy, another sadistic SI!  The human race isn't some entity you can<br>
negotiate with; it's a bunch of humans, for whom war and murder and<br>
other less unpleasant activities are sometimes dysfunctions, but often<br>
are rational responses to the situation at hand.  Expecting a huge bunch<br>
of approximately autonomous humans to suddenly act like a borg because<br>
of threat of destruction isn't necessarily bright, or kind if it is bright.<br>

After all, who says the &gt;borgs will have solved such problems among<br>
themselves?  I doubt it.<br>

Leave Calvin and the Bible to the parish o' Dunbar.<br>
Give a blind man back his eyes to find the brightest o' the stars.<br>
Then lead him to the altar of a better God by far<br>
