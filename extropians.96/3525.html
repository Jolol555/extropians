<i>&gt; 1) It didn't occur to Eliezer that FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON is not a scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; report of an actual experiment and its sequelae but a crafted tragedy which</i><br>
<i>&gt; depends for its heartbreaking power upon that conclusion.</i><br>
What?  I don't get it.  I made a point that Charlie was a genius only in<br>
name.  FFA being fiction does not contradict this...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) It didn't occur to anaesthesiologists that if there were a technique to</i><br>
<i>&gt; control pain, with no downside, it would long since have occured as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural mutation.  Just as well it didn't occur to them.</i><br>
Controlling pain is a *major* evolutionary disadvantage.  Pain evolved<br>
as an evolutionary advantage; removing it is a disadvantage.  People<br>
with off-switches for pain would not tend to survive to adulthood. <br>
Pearce lists among his bookmarks a fellow who experiences no pain.  He<br>
once had trouble closing a door, only to notice that his hand was stuck<br>
in it.  It's amazing that poor guy's still alive, pleasant as his life<br>
may be.<br>
So in answer, your statement is correct but *you* are completely wrong.<br>
