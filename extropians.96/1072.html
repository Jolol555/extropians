<i>                &gt;What's the difference between improving us and improving our                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;tools? Aren't tools just extensions of ourselves?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A million years ago a stone ax was one of our best tools, back then if you <br>
were lucky enough to find a freshly killed large animal it made perfect sense <br>
to eat and eat and stuff yourself silly, because it might be a very long time <br>
before you find that much food again. Today our tools are different, we have<br>
things like refrigerators and grocery stores and it's no longer a good idea <br>
to eat as much food as you can shove in your face, but we have not changed so  <br>
we do it anyway and get fat.  <br>
<p>
Solving differential equations is not intrinsically difficult, our primitive <br>
computers are very good at it, lots of people, like me, would love to be able <br>
to solve them in their head in a few seconds, but at the time we evolved that <br>
ability had no survival advantage so  people are terrible at it.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Hands and intelligence evolved together.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, that certainly seems to be true, but I'd love to know the details of why <br>
that is true.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;My point is that everything costs something. This is just a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;natural fact, like friction in physics.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nobody is saying everything will be free. The price of the things we are  <br>
familiar with will never be zero, but it will approach zero asymptotely.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;What if they [diamonds] grew on trees that only grow half a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;mile underground in certain geological formations that only                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;occur in a few places in the world?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then diamonds would still be expensive. Obviously a Nanotechnology machine is  <br>
of no use to us if we don't have  accesses to it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;The silk worm can not reproduce itself in just any                         </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;simple environment,  only in a very specific, very                          </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;complex one.</i><br>
  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Exactly.  Just like orange trees.  Just like anything that                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;grows. Diamond trees, if they existed, would only grow in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;certain environments, and diamonds would still cost something.          </i><br>
       <br>
<p>
Nanotechnology would be much less sensitive to the environment than life is, <br>
or anything else we're familiar with, because it's only interested in the <br>
types of atoms in the environment, not how those atoms are put together. <br>
If your business is destroying buildings so you can reuse the bricks it's <br>
really not important what the architectural style of those buildings was.<br>
<p>
Of course Nanotechnology wouldn't be totally immune from the environment, <br>
great heat could be a problem, so would radiation if it was huge, like the <br>
center of a working nuclear reactor. I suppose you'd need special precautions <br>
if you wanted to operate in an ocean of liquid fluorine, but beyond that the <br>
environment is not important to Nanotechnology. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Some products will come from organisms or processes that                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;push the envelope of what's possible, and these products                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;will be expensive.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Large quantities of rare elements would still be hard to get, but I don't  <br>
think they'd be terribly expensive because the demand would not be large. <br>
Not a lot of uses for Californium. By far the most important elements would  <br>
be carbon and hydrogen and both are very common. In spite of this I basically <br>
agree with you, some things probably would be expensive, but those luxury <br>
items are things that our puny human brain could no more understand than a <br>
goldfish could understand a nuclear submarine.<br>

<i>                &gt;nanites are going to require programming and design                </i><br>
                <br>
Yes.                                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Some programmers and designers will do their jobs supremely                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;well, and produce  masterpieces of whatever they are making                 </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;other programmers and designers will  give less attention to                 </i><br>
                their tasks                   <br>
                <br>
<p>
Yes. <br>
                                                             <br>
<i>                &gt;and they will produce cheaper, generic  diamondoid products.   </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
No.  A shoddy design will not be produced, it will never get beyond the   <br>
prototype stage. If a superior design exists it will not be easier or cheaper  <br>
to use a crummy design.  By the way, reverse engineering would be a trivial <br>
task with Nanotechnology.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;They [Factories] will employ biotechnologists with rare and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;expensive skills.                </i><br>
 <br>
<p>
There is only one difference between a man (or a machine) who has skills and  <br>
a man who does not, the pattern of atoms arranged in his brain. <br>
Nanotechnology is about changing the way  patterns of atoms are arranged.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The managers will still understand the concept of planned                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;obsolescence.                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you mean there is no point in going to the trouble to make something that  <br>
will last longer than you will want to use, then I agree, but that's just  <br>
good engineering.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;the advent of molecular manufacturing will merely be an                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;adjustment within the existing economy.  The economy itself                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;won't cease to exist.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Using the words "merely" and "adjustment" in this context reminds me of NASA  <br>
calling the explosion on the space shuttle an "energetic disassembly". I am  <br>
certain  there will be an economy after The Singularity, any system that <br>
obeys the laws of Thermodynamics must have something like a economy, I am <br>
also certain that this economy will evolve over time, History will not stop. <br>
I am certain all  these things will exist, but I don't have the slightest <br>
idea of what they will be.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;The American economy is a genie machine, to a close                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;approximation. We can produce just about everything we want                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, but not in the quantities we want, that's why everybody isn't rich.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;In a genie machine there are a hundred million jobs that                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;need to be done.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And a Nanotechnology machine would have thousands of trillions of parts, <br>
per ounce.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I have been talking about the size of a genie machine, where                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;size is measured by complexity -- the number of jobs.  What                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;about size in the  sense of spatial extent?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
To build something, anything, you need 2 things:<br>
<p>
1) The ability to pick up the parts of an object and place them where you   <br>
   want them, and do it without damaging the parts. It's difficult to move    <br>
   individual atoms but at least you don't need to worry about damaging them,    <br>
   unlike a conventional factory that uses complex and fragile parts. Once  <br>
   you have mastered this admittedly difficult skill you only need one other    <br>
   thing to make anything.<br>
<p>
2) The information on where the parts should go. The spatial extent of the   <br>
   object is irrelevant.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;A genie machine has to be able to make ships, airports,                  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;cities -- anything.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
As long as a Nanotechnology machine has access to enough raw matter and raw <br>
energy the size of the thing it's building is not important, it's still just <br>
"pick up that atom here and put it over there.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Asking the beach-ball Japan to make a ship would be like                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;asking the actual Japan to make something the size of the                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;earth.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Do the math. Assuming the ball had a volume of one cubic foot and even <br>
assuming it took a full month (to Nanotechnology that's a very long time) for <br>
your beach ball to make a second beach ball, it would only take 6 years to <br>
make something as big as the earth.<br>
