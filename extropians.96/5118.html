<p>
Michael was quoting me, so I guess I should reply. What I meant was that<br>
there is zero chance of microbes having ever lived on the moon. There is no<br>
evidence of a watery past for the Moon, as there is on Mars. The ice is<br>
probably the remains of a comet impact (a very light impact I imagine, since<br>
those usually generate a lot of heat). Panspermians may believe in microbes<br>
in comets, but I'd bet against it.<br>
<p>
BTW, the link to the report I referred to didn't come across in Michael's<br>
text clip. It's<br>
<a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/9612/02/moon.life/index.html">http://cnn.com/TECH/9612/02/moon.life/index.html</a><br>
<p>
P.S. Michael was dead on about the Moon being a good source for He3. That<br>
would require a lot of onsite processing, i.e., people. And I didn't know<br>
you could slow-roast regolith to get oxygen. So now I'm excited about moon<br>
colonies again. Thanks.<br>
