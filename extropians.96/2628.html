A few months ago I wrote 3 messages to the list about a little adventure I <br>
had. As the question of personal identity and copies has come up again and <br>
there are a lot of new members I thought I'd repeat it.<br>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 <br>
<p>
<p>
I need some advice and it's not the sort of thing I can write to<br>
Ann Landers. About a year ago I started building a matter<br>
duplicating machine. It could find the position and velocity of<br>
every atom in a human being to the limit imposed by Heisenberg's law. <br>
It then used this information to construct a copy and it does it all <br>
in a fraction of a second and without harming the  original  in any way. <br>
You may be surprised that I was able to build such a  complicated machine, <br>
but you wouldn't be if you knew how good I am with my hands. The birdhouse <br>
I made is simply lovely and I have all the latest tools from Sears.<br>
<p>
I was a little nervous but I decided to test the machine by<br>
duplicating myself. The day before yesterday I walked into the<br>
chamber, it filled with smoke (damn those radio shack transformers) <br>
there was a flash of light, and then 3 feet to my left <br>
was a man who looked exactly like me. It  was at that<br>
instant that the full realization of the terrible thing I did<br>
hit me. I yelled " This is monstrous, there can only be one of me",  <br>
my copy yelled exactly the same thing. I thought he was<br>
trying to mock me, so I reached for my 44 magnum that I always<br>
carry with me (I wonder why people think I'm strange) and<br>
pointed it at my double. I noted with alarm that the double also<br>
had a gun and he was pointed it at me. I shouted "you don't have<br>
the guts to pull the trigger, but I do". Again he mimicked my<br>
words and did so in perfect synchronization, this made me even<br>
more angry and I pulled the trigger, he did too. My gun went off<br>
but his gun jammed. I buried him in my back yard.<br>
<p>
Now that my anger has cooled and I can think more clearly I've<br>
had  some pangs of conscious about killing a living creature,<br>
but that's not what really torments me. How do I know I'm  not<br>
the copy? I feel exactly  the same as before, but would a copy<br>
feel different? Actually there is a  way to be certain, I have a<br>
video tape of the entire experiment. My memory is  that the copy<br>
first appeared 3 feet to my LEFT, if the tape shows the original<br>
walking into the chamber and the copy materializing 3 feet to<br>
his RIGHT, then I would know that I am the copy. <br>
<p>
I'm afraid to look at the tape, should I  be? If I found out I<br>
was the copy  what should I do? I suppose I should morn the<br>
death of John Clark, but how  can I, I'm not dead. If I am the<br>
copy would that mean that I have no real  past and my life is<br>
meaningless? Is it important, or should I just burn the  tape<br>
and forget all about it?<br>
<p>
==========================================================================<br>
<p>
Feb 14 1996<br>
<p>
<p>
A few  days after I posted the above the shit really hit the fan. My PPA <br>
the Acme Protection Agency found out about it, and  I'd love to know which<br>
one of you guys squealed to them. Anyway, they were hounding me<br>
constantly, following me around and asking all sorts of<br>
embarrassing questions. I tried to explain to them that nobody<br>
really died because no consciousness was stopped or even<br>
interrupted, but they weren't impressed with my arguments. All <br>
they were interested in was that there was a dead body and it<br>
had John Clark's  DNA and John Clark was one of their clients. I<br>
picked Acme originally because they were a honest, tough no nonsense <br>
organization,  but now I wished I had picked a PPA that had <br>
a more philosophical bent. The fact that Acme also has capital punishment <br>
didn't seem as appealing as it once did either. <br>
        <br>
I knew that if I was going to do something I had to do it quickly. <br>
My lawyer told me I should expect to be arrested in the<br>
next few days. He said that my best bet was to plead self defense,<br>
but he didn't seem very optimistic, and  even if I eventually<br>
won it would take years and every dime I had in legal  bills. <br>
I had a better idea, it would solve things in one day and it would<br>
only cost half my money, but I would have to do something I'd<br>
been dreading  first. I looked at the video tape,  my worst<br>
fears were confirmed, I am the  copy, no doubt about it. This<br>
sort of threw me for a loop at first, but I  gradually got used<br>
to the idea, and now realized that I feel just the same so it<br>
can't possibly make any difference.<br>
<p>
I set up my video camera so it covered the entrance to the<br>
duplicating  chamber but was careful to make sure that this time<br>
it couldn't see into the chamber itself. I turned on my<br>
duplicating machine and walked into the  chamber, a few seconds<br>
later I walked out but there was somebody with me, somebody who<br>
looked just like me. I sent the tape to Acme and they dropped<br>
all charges against me. They had no choice, Acme may be tough<br>
but no PPA will  prosecute someone if they know there is a 50%<br>
probability they are innocent. They have no way of knowing<br>
which one of us killed the original John Clark,  even we don't know. <br>
<p>
Well, this solved one problem but it created another one, the copy. <br>
I've tried  to be broad minded about it, really I have,<br>
but the man is just obnoxious.  Mr. Know-it-all is always<br>
droning on and on about the stupidest things, and he thinks he's<br>
SO smart, personally I think he's a moron. Just as I feared he <br>
says he deserves half of my money, but I'm the one who made it<br>
not him, I remember how I earned every dollar. I don't like the<br>
way he looks at my girlfriend either.<br>
<p>
This entire experience has made me a wiser man. I now understand<br>
the value of subtlety, putting a bullet in the brain of the<br>
original John Clark was stupid. I also understand that the world <br>
is a dangerous place and that dreadful accidents happen every day. <br>
How very sad. <br>
<p>
I'm looking at the jerk right now  and he has an insufferable grin <br>
on his face. I don't know why he's looking so smug but that's OK, <br>
let him grin while he can, it won't last long. I know exactly how to <br>
deal with him, and to think, people used to say that I understood machines <br>
but not people. I'll soon prove them wrong.<br>
<p>
It looks like he's also writing a post but I can't quite make<br>
out from here what he's saying, probably just a bunch of<br>
pretentious nonsense, I'll read it when I come back, right now<br>
I've got to drive into town to get some supplies. I'll be<br>
mighty happy when summer comes, I do so hate driving on these icy<br>
mountain roads.<br>
<p>
<p>
===========================================================================<br>
Feb 18 1996<br>
<p>
I had decided that the only way to get Acme Protection Agency off my back was <br>
to make a duplicate of myself, that way they couldn't tell which one killed <br>
the original John Clark  so they couldn't prosecute either one of us. <br>
I walked  into the chamber expecting to see my double materialize next to me, <br>
but nothing happened. Terrified that the machine was malfunctioning I ran to<br>
the control panel, one of these days I've got to figure out a way to build a <br>
matter duplicating machine without using 89 pounds of enriched plutonium. <br>
To my surprise I could not find anything wrong with the machine, then I <br>
noticed  I wasn't alone. A large tough looking man was staring at me. <br>
<p>
"What the hell! How did you get in here?" I yelled at him. <br>
<p>
"Oh, sorry, sorry, didn't mean to offend,ah, are you John Clark" He stammered.<br>
<p>
For a tough looking guy he was sure acting like a wimp. I never could  <br>
intimidate big gorillas like this guy, but I guess those assertiveness <br>
training  tapes I bought on the home shopping network were paying off after <br>
all.<br>
<p>
"Yea I'm Clark and who the fuck are you"  I said in the tough man voice the <br>
tapes had taught me. <br>
<p>
Then I  noticed it was dark outside, 5 minutes before when I walked into the <br>
chamber it was about noon. <br>
<p>
" What's going on?" I said, not sounding quite so tough.<br>
<p>
" Oh I'm sorry, my name is Spade, Sam Spade, I'm a private investigator, <br>
I work for Acme, but don't worry I'm not here to arrest you or anything. <br>
Ten and a half days have passed since you walked into that chamber, and <br>
there is nothing wrong with your machine, it's sort of hard to explain but <br>
the fact is, I used the machine's maintenance logs to reconstruct you  <br>
5 minutes ago, just as you were the last time you used the machine, <br>
10 and a half days ago."<br>
<p>
For some, finding out they were a copy of a copy would be big news, but for <br>
me it was getting to be old hat. What was amazing was that some gum shoe had <br>
done it, and from the maintenance log. The information on the state of the <br>
machine and thus on every object I ever duplicated is in those computer logs, <br>
but the format of the logs would make it difficult to extract because that's <br>
not what they were made for. I never used them for anything except <br>
troubleshooting  the machine.<br>
<p>
"My congratulations Mr. Spade" I said " it's not every private eye that has a  <br>
good enough working knowledge of Schrodinger's Wave Equation, quantum <br>
coherence and non linear error correcting codes to read those logs correctly".<br>
<p>
"Yeah well... I got an A in shop class when I was a kid" He said with a touch <br>
of pride.<br>
<p>
"Really! I did too." I said " But what's been going on for the last 10 days?" <br>
<p>
Spade said "The copy of John Clark did duplicate himself, but apparently the  <br>
two versions didn't get along". <br>
<p>
" I've been told I'm a hard man to live with" I said a little sheepishly.<br>
<p>
"Both Clarks are dead, and they died at almost exactly the same time, <br>
it  could be accidental, but the deaths are a little suspicious, especially <br>
when you consider two almost identical posts made to the to the internet by <br>
them that are somewhat incriminating. One Clark was found in his car at the <br>
bottom of a thousand foot cliff. The roads were icy, but the brake lines <br>
didn't look quite right to me. The other Clark was found crushed under a <br>
Coke machine. The consensus is that  he put in his 50 cents and when it <br>
didn't give him his Coke he started beating on it until the machine tipped <br>
over on him and fractured his skull. Well maybe, but that machine was heavy, <br>
I tried, I could tip it over and I'm bigger than he was. I think they killed <br>
each other, they were similar enough to want to kill each other but diverged <br>
enough in 10 days to chose different methods".<br>
<p>
" Now you can't blame that on me" I said indignity, " I know nothing about it, <br>
I didn't even exist then, well not exactly..."<br>
<p>
"Nobody's blaming you" Spade said soothingly " and you are still one of our <br>
clients, so when I mentioned the maintenance logs in my report my boss said <br>
we were legally bound to make a good faith effort to revive you, so he told <br>
me to give it a try and do my best."<br>
<p>
He brought out a document from his coat " I am also authorized to offer you <br>
this deal, Acme agrees not to prosecute you in any manner for this incident  <br>
and to seal the case file, there are those who might find it, ah, titillating. <br>
In return, you absolve Acme of any liability in this matter and agree to <br>
resign from The Acme Protection agency within 5 working days. The unused <br>
portion of your premium will of course be refunded."<br>
<p>
Now you can't beat that deal with a stick, I signed the paper before they <br>
could change their mind. <br>
<p>
I said " I want to thank you Mr. Spade for bringing me back. Can I offer you <br>
a drink?"<br>
<p>
He was already heading for his car at a trot "Thanks but no" He said " I've <br>
got this, this important thing I've got to do, It's ah, a thing of importance, <br>
I've got to, ah, wash the lawn, I mean mow  the dog, I mean... good-bye".  <br>
<p>
I'm afraid our Mr.Spade is a bit of an oddball , I seem to run across more <br>
and more people like him lately.<br>
    <br>
As I stood there amid the smell of burning rubber a disturbing thought <br>
occurred to me, it was a pretty tricky job to get all the information about <br>
me just from the maintenance logs, was I really  OK, had Spade gotten <br>
everything right? I've always been good at mental arithmetic so I gave myself <br>
a test, 5 and 5 is 10, 19 minus 6 is 12, 8 times 9 is 73. Right on the money! <br>
That was reassuring. <br>
<p>
I must be John Clark, I have all of his memories, I remembered a happy day in <br>
my childhood when I joined the Vladimer Lenin fan club and received an <br>
autographed  8 by 10 glossy of the master that has hung in a place of honor <br>
in my bedroom until it disappeared that very day. Spade must of stolen it.  <br>
I remembered my triumphant election as the head of SHIT (Stop Heretical <br>
Independent Thoughts) and how I had always hated the Extropian and Transhuman <br>
philosophy. The memory of the time I played Twister in The Kremlin with <br>
Marilyn Monroe, J Edgar Hoover and The Dalai Lama while the Pope serenaded us <br>
with a lovely rendition  of Louie Louie, are as sharp in my mind as the day <br>
it happened.<br>
<p>
Clearly there was nothing wrong with my mind, but what about my body? <br>
I looked at myself in a mirror and I don't want to brag or anything but <br>
I looked great! My skin was a nice healthy blue, the scales on the tail were <br>
strong and sharper than ever. I smiled, what women wouldn't fall for that <br>
infectious grin and the handsome green slime that oozed out between my fangs <br>
and fell artistically to the floor.<br>
