IAN: That is logical: all notions of rights and ownership, <br>
are, like all notions, merely mental fabrications. <br>
<p>
However, some notions and their application as rules of human<br>
action prove to be more effective than other notions in reaching<br>
a given set of desired outcomes, such as technological progress.<br>
The theoretical system of private property rights proves most<br>
effective as a means toward technological progress, which<br>
in turn improves the welfare of the majority.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the most scientific measure of "ownership" is that X<br>
owns Y where X controls Y.  The Earth owns us all, the galaxy <br>
owns the Earth, and the Universe the galaxy. But at the smaller<br>
end of things, "I" own my body, or my body owns my body, because <br>
my body controls itself. Or more clearly, my body owns itself<br>
to the degree that it controls itself. By extension, my body<br>
owns those things in its external area that it controls,<br>
or manipulates. In this sense "ownership" is not "a <br>
hilariously ridiculous notion" as you suggest.<br>
