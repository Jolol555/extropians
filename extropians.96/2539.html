yeah, i agree<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; yup, although i don't think of the population of Uraguay in terms</i><br>

<i>&gt; Why not? It goes both ways. The only way you could make a profit from</i><br>

<i>&gt; of those egoists who never wants to be of service to anyone but yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; and your personal acquaintances.  ;)</i><br>
<p>
Nope, i'd define one of those egoists as someone who'd never help another<br>
unless they profited by it.  <br>
it seems to me that the opposite of "egoist" would be "selfless",<br>
as in "her selfless actions brought hope to many".<br>

<i>&gt; Yes, I think love can be thought of as a business.  I like business and don't</i><br>

<i>&gt; a profit and sometimes not.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; 2) are you married, in a Relationship, is this a relationship based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; trade ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it is based on trade:  Married people enter into a contractual</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship with all the meanings that has.</i><br>
<p>
not to love, honour and cherish, in sickness and in health, <br>
for better and for worse ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; 3) im curious as to how you define success as in "The most successful</i><br>
<i>&gt; people..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I define it as people who are happy because they have satisfied the four</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas of human happiness: to live well (eat, sleep, shelter, etc.) , to love</i><br>
<i>&gt; (friends, lovers, customers, etc.), to learn (to know things about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world), and to leave a legacy (to leave their mark on the world.)</i><br>
<p>
only one of the examples above require business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are responsible for ourselves first,  NOT to our neighbors, children,</i><br>
<i>&gt; aging parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped nor anyone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; first.   If we can not take care of our selves we can not help anybody else.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "We are all self-employed" meme satisfies the first and basic need, to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for oneself.   That is the basis of all other help we may then</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose to give others.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Without the meme _We are all self-employed_  there can be no help given to</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone in the other groups you mention (friends, neighbors, children, aging</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents, the mentally ill, intellectually handicapped).</i><br>
<p>
incorrect, the _We are all self-employed_ meme (M:WaaSE), is being discussed<br>
as being useful to propagate, therefore it is not now universally current.<br>
But being responsible for others in our communities is (where i come from)<br>
a common even old fashioned idea.  Therefore we do not require M:WaaSE to<br>
exist for help to be given.<br>
<p>
And if M:WaaSE was dominant, would people give aid if it didn't return a <br>
profit ?   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Imagine the alternative meme "We are all NOT self-employed".  To me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; means "It's not MY neck (business) if I get in trouble.  Lets leach off</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone else.  We don't need to be responsible for our own life. I'll let my</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents, government, religion, charity, neighbors, etc. help me and I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to worry about paying them back (altruism)."    It's a win-LOSE or</i><br>
<i>&gt; lose-win meme, zero-sum game. </i><br>
<p>
A simple alternative is meaningless.<br>
The alternative to "Always help those in need" (Saintliness) <br>
is "Never help those in need", i would not advocate either.<br>
<p>
Also, by your own argument above, would not a more useful meme (and one fairly<br>
current) be "I am responsible for my own life".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "We are all NOT self-employed"  could be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; motto for a communist (or any "Big Brother" style) government or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialist-libertarian anarchy.</i><br>
<p>
I come from a thriving Social Democratic society, at our last election, <br>
3 weeks ago we had a turnout in the high 80's (%), we have fairly <br>
universal (if somewhat abraided by New Right Economics) health care <br>
and Social Welfare.<br>
<p>
New Zealand is a bloody wonderful country, with a strong history of<br>
middle of the road Liberal/Socialist policies.  Pure Libertarianism<br>
Capitalism may be a workable system (tho' i doubt it), but i know by<br>
looking around me that it ain't the only way that works.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "We are all self-employed" is a win-win idea for capitalist or</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian-capitalist anarchy.  To get repeat love/business, treat other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people the way you would like to be treated (The Golden Rule).</i><br>
<p>
"he who has the gold makes the rules"<br>
<p>
As an excercise, may i suggest that you visit several different public<br>
places and observe.  Check out a Library, a beach, a playground,<br>
a supermarket and your family home.   Watch peoples' behaviour,<br>
is every relationship a business relationship ?  or are there more<br>
economical (using Occams razor) explanations and models ?<br>
