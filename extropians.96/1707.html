Thanks, Hara, for a very stimulating post.  I have a follow-up question.<br>
But first, given all the recent discussion about noise &amp; repetition on<br>
the list, e.g.,<br>

&lt;I'm actually beginning to believe the ravings of Mark Plus that<br>

<p>
and given that I've only been on the list since it became open in<br>
August, I hope if my questions raise issues that have already been<br>
discussed by the Old Ones (the 'eagles' who mostly seem to be silent<br>
lately) they will be interpreted in the context of spreading memes to<br>
newcomers, as opposed to being seen as a noisy repetitive loop.<br>
 ---------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hara Ra wrote (and hopefully my snips maintain your context):<br>
&lt;recovery of feelings and emotion and "sense of experiencing" are all<br>
memory based [snip] Information always requires context, the hardware<br>
within which it is realised [snip] the notion of self awareness ... is a<br>
loop stating  that "I exist"... all experiences are encoded with the<br>
presence of this loop.&gt;<br>
<p>
Hara goes on to provide some interesting discussion of "the universe as<br>
a kind of giant Feynman diagram" and then concludes:<br>
&lt;Another point to notice is that preserving physical memory implies that<br>
some of the particle states are not changed, which limits the number of<br>
possible memory preserving transformations. Ie, we come from many<br>
possible pasts and it is not possible to know which ones. Memory limits<br>
the possibilities both ways. This creates outrageous conclusions, which<br>
I use in my shamanic work&gt;<br>
<p>
My question is, has the following been discussed on the list, or does<br>
anyone have any opinions about it?<br>
<p>
In ch.4 of his book _Elemental Mind_, Nick Herbert describes the<br>
little-known Spacetime Reductive Materialism (SRM) theories of<br>
consciousness proposed by California PolyTechnic professor James<br>
Culbertson (author of _The Minds Of Robot_, 1963, and _Consciousness:<br>
Natural &amp; Artificial_, 1984, which, as Herbert notes, "has been<br>
generally dismissed by mainstream scientists as quirky and<br>
impractical"). SRM models are based on reflection points, influence<br>
trees and outlook trees described by 3 attributes: intensity, quality &amp;<br>
connectiveness.<br>
<p>
Superficially this sounds like it might be a useful model of<br>
consciousness, but then Herbert goes on to add, "Culbertson's answer to<br>
the evolutionary question [of why consciousness is advantageous] is that<br>
because of their ability to store memories in spacetime. rather than in<br>
space, conscious computers can perform the same job as unconscious<br>
computers  and require fewer parts to do so ... a conscious computer ...<br>
can access events that have happened long ago, events that lie 'outside'<br>
the computer's present state ... [having the advantage of] a kind of<br>
invisible spacetime 'hard disk' - that could give conscousness a<br>
competitive edge in the Darwinian struggle for existence." (p134).<br>
<p>
Nick Herbert also quotes physicist Herman Weyl (known for his particle<br>
physics 'gauge theory' efforts): "The objective world simply is; it does<br>
not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along<br>
the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a<br>
fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time." (p121)<br>
<p>
All of this seems to imply that memories and experiences might somehow<br>
be distributed in the environment through which we have passed, like<br>
some kind of hypertext Web that we can link to in some apparently<br>
non-local way (or, perhaps, by virtue of us being parallel processors in<br>
a larger network we're only beginning to glimpse), rather than *just*<br>
being hardcoded into our brains and central nervous systems.  While I<br>
agree that "information always requires context, the hardware within<br>
which it is realised", this SRM theory still sounds appealing to my<br>
naive, 'creole physics' understanding of things (the foundation of which<br>
views reality as consisting of three 'tangled hierarchies': Content,<br>
Context &amp; Contest ).  BUT, I have a hard time reconciling it with<br>
traditional scientific theories and approaches to uploading.<br>
