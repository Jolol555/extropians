I never mentioned alcoholism as dependent on the state of the economy.<br>
But come to think of it, i suspect you'll find that there are statistical<br>
correlations between Unemployment levels and, Violent Crime, addiction rates,<br>
suicides and mental illness.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; SOmeone who freely choses not to make the effort to obtain the education</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; THe HIGH poverty is a function of the amount of government subsidy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduction among those who freely choose to remain in poverty.</i><br>
<p>
I strongly disagree.  By your argument, if we exterminated those losers<br>
who "choose" to be poor, then we'll have "solved" poverty.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your Dale Carngie had it right. We are all free to chose wealth or</i><br>

<i>&gt; under bridges.</i><br>

ok, i dare you to *choose* to be a multi-billionaire.<br>

<i>&gt; Why?  Do you have better alternatives?  Better than. . . Capitalism?</i><br>
<p>
Yep, extremist-woolly-liberal middle-of-the-road socialism.<br>
Not State Socialism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's wrong with consumer choice and the voice of the people?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't you agree with private property?</i><br>

<i>&gt; Or, tort liability?</i><br>
<p>
Actually i take Mr Proudhons' stance that Property (in Capitalist terms)<br>
is Theft.  If a mining company discovers, claims and mines a large seam of <br>
coal, then i believe that they have stolen it from me and by implication,<br>
the everybody else (aka The People).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Banjo&gt;&gt;where is the proof ?&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; USSR (past, and for good reason past), Cuba, China and many other nations</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't let the consumer decide anything.  It's all state controlled.</i><br>
<p>
Communism, State Socialism isn't the only form of Socialism.<br>
It's unsophisticated and only useful for controlling peasant economies.<br>
There are many sucessful countries that are Socialist, look to Scandinavia,<br>
Australasia etc<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Contrast the capitalist countries with these.  Where would you want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; live?  No consumer choice, no property, and only contract law based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; government regulation of business deals.  Who has maximized the social</i><br>
<i>&gt; outcomes more?   I admit the US has increased the fascist-socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulations (private property gun control e.g. Republicans) and the Democrats</i><br>
<i>&gt; have reduced freedoms ways resembling communism  (increased taxation used for</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare programs).   But then, I'm a Libertarian and can see the US slipping</i><br>
<i>&gt; away from "Ian's maximum social outcomes".</i><br>
<p>
Taxing the rich (a little) to aid the poor (a little) is not Communism.<br>
<p>
You ask me where i would rather live... hey im already here. Godzone New Zealand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; how does "maximal social outcomes" coincide with high poverty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  homelessness, a stuffed-to-overflowing penal system, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you talking about the USSR and China?  They are the lowest standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; living I can think of in industrialized countries.  They have high poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt; and overflowing prisons.  The "homeless" in the US have the highest standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; of living than in "homeless"any other county.  Even Jesus said the poor, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; will always be with us.</i><br>
<p>
Well, if jesus said it was ok then it must be, not! <br>
<p>
The USA, USSR and China may be SuperPowers but they ain't the only countries<br>
in the world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Dale Carnegie?  Mr. _How to Win Friends and Influence People_.  You are free</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be rich or poor, it is up to you.</i><br>
<p>
Please inform the slum dwellers of Sao Paulo that they've chosen to be poor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &lt;&lt;some people don't win in a market economy&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not a meaningful statement.  Some people are lazy, stupid or</i><br>
<i>&gt; pessimistic too.    Tell me of a situation were most people win: Anytime you</i><br>
<i>&gt; pay for a product you want more than the money you spend.  For me that's most</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the time.  The fact that I don't "win" every time (Lose-win) makes up for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the times I (Win-Lose).  In general most situations are Win-Win in a market</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy and the standard of living goes up.  You make your own luck and for</i><br>
<i>&gt; some, the standard of living goes down or does so temporarily.</i><br>
<p>
Im not against a market economy, but i feel that, like all things, it should<br>
be applied in moderation.<br>
<p>
Your argument that some people "are lazy, stupid or pessimistic too", implies<br>
the Calvanist doctrine that the rich deserve to be praised for the wonderful<br>
qualities that made them rich, and that the poor must be chastized for the<br>
being the worthless slobs that they self-evidently are.<br>
<p>
maybe we should drop this or take it to private email, <br>
is this on-topic for extropians ?<br>
