The topics of conversation vary considerably over time. Sometimes there's a<br>
focus on physics, or neuroscience, or computers, or genetics, other times<br>
it's more on philosophical or cultural issues.<br>
 <br>

<i>&gt;It doesn't unsettle me, only the complete absence of technically flavoured </i><br>

<p>
Which reminds me: There was some talk about one person or a group<br>
coordinating the collection of former posts and getting permissions. I'd be<br>
delighted to see this happen. Who had suggested or volunteered for this? I<br>
have almost all the archives if someone wants to start going through them<br>
for good posts and to contact writers to permission to make them available.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;existance of the extropians and the transhuman mailing list to be </i><br>

<i>&gt;hint).</i><br>
<p>
Funny, it's always seemed to me that the signal to noise ratio is much<br>
better on the Extropians list. Far fewer nasty fights here, and less time<br>
spent on clueing people in. There's zero chance that the Extropians list<br>
will quit to give the Transhuman list a monopoly on discussion of these topics.<br>
