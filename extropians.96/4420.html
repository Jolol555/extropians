<p>
One link between depression and creativity is rumination. Mulling things<br>
over, following lots of mental paths, etc., can result in creative ideas<br>
or depression depending on which way your brain turns.  One part of being<br>
an optimist is not dwelling on bad things very long, keeping busy.  One<br>
part of being creative is thinking about something a lot.<br>
<p>
One thing you could try is working harder on other parts of optimism<br>
(bad things are temporary, limited, and not your fault; good things are<br>
lasting, significant, and your own doing) so that you can afford to spend<br>
some time in unstructured thinking.  Other things you might try are picking <br>
particular things to be creative about, reading a few of the excellent <br>
books giving methods for being creative, and doing enough new things<br>
in rapid succession that you mix up your conception of the world a bit.<br>
