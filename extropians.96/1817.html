Computer power have been doubling every 18 months or so since<br>
about 1950. Recently, the computing power accessible to my nominal<br>
researcher/hacker has been increasing a lot faster than that as<br>
machines have joined the internet. My assumption is<br>
that at some point a critical mass will be reached. My scenario<br>
has apparently not yet happened (as of last week) because the<br>
critical mass has not yet been reached or because it's been<br>
reached recently and the researcher hasn't gotten around to it<br>
yet. (Sometimes I wonder about Bill Gates....  :-)<br>
<p>
Computing power is not necessarily the only critical element.<br>
It's possible that the final missing link will be a particular<br>
piece of software such as an information-visualization package,<br>
or a decision-support package, or a knowledge database. The point<br>
is that the internet may then enter a super-critical condition<br>
in which a single seed may precipitate a phase change.<br>
