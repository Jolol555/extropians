My post last night may have come as a shock to some people.  In this <br>
post and the following one, I want to indicate very briefly what I mean <br>
when I say there are logical gaps in Michael Shermer's argument.  <br>
<p>
On pages 52 -53 of "Proving the Holocaust" there are two photographs <br>
showing crowds of people on the unloading platform at Auschwitz.  <br>
The caption of the second one says:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; These two photos serve as evidence that corroborate eyewitness </i><br>
<i>&gt; accounts of the arrival of a train of Hungarian Jews at Auschwitz and </i><br>
<i>&gt; the sorting of them into groups of men and women, where they were </i><br>
<i>&gt; then further subdivided and sent toward either the gas chambers or </i><br>
<i>&gt; the camp barracks.</i><br>
<p>
There are two assertions, <br>
<p>
1.  Trainloads of Jews arrived and were sorted into groups, <br>
2.  They were then further subdivided and sent toward either the gas <br>
chambers or the camp barracks.  <br>
<p>
These pictures corroborate the first assertion (which doesn't need to be <br>
corroborated, since it is obvious and acknowledged by everyone).  <br>
The pictures do not corroborate the second assertion, which is what <br>
needs to be proved.  <br>
<p>
Ignoratio elenchi:  the fallacy of offering proof irrelevant to the <br>
proposition in question.  A simpler term for this is "flim-flam."  <br>
<p>
Suppose you have two photographs of crowds of people in a large <br>
room, with the caption "These photographs corroborate testimony that <br>
people go to Eugenio the Psychic Surgeon, wait in his waiting room, <br>
and then go into his office and have tumors removed by psychic <br>
surgery."  Obviously, the photographs only corroborate the fact that <br>
they wait in the waiting room; they do not corroborate what needs to be <br>
proved, namely, that the patients have tumors removed by psychic <br>
surgery. <br>
<p>
Suppose you are on trial for murder.  The prosecutor introduces as <br>
evidence two photographs of boys in your living room, and says <br>
"These photographs corroborate the testimony of the witnesses who <br>
said the defendant lured boys to his home, then took them downstairs to <br>
the basement and killed them."  What would you want your lawyer to <br>
say at this point?  <br>
<p>
To corroborate testimony about gassings, you need to have photographs <br>
of gassings, not something else.  You have to show us pictures of <br>
people in the undressing room, in the gas chamber itself, and then after <br>
the gassing.  <br>

<p>
<i>&gt; After about two minutes the shrieks die down and change to a low </i><br>
<i>&gt; moaning.  Most of the men have already lost consciousness.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; After a further two minutes... it is all over.  Deadly quiet reigns... </i><br>
<i>&gt; The corpses are piled together, their mouths stretched open... </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is difficult to heave the interlaced corpses out of the chamber </i><br>
<i>&gt; as the gas is stiffening all their limbs.  </i><br>
<p>
Of course, we have all heard about this.  We all have this image of the <br>
sonderkommandos disentangling a mass of bodies.  But it occurs to me <br>
that this is just a mental image I have acquired over the years.  I have <br>
never actually seen a photograph of this famous scene.  And that's odd.  <br>
This must have happened many, many times.  If millions of people <br>
were gassed, this scene must have been repeated thousands of times.  <br>
And people do like to take photos.  Some people will always find a way <br>
to take photos of anything, no matter how forbidden or obscure, <br>
especially if there are naked women involved.  But there are no photos <br>
of any part of the gassing operation -- no photos of crowds in the <br>
undressing room, no photos of people being herded into the<br>
gas chambers, and no photos of masses of bodies in the chambers.  <br>
<p>
The Nazis were not shy about killing people.  There are pictures of all <br>
kinds of atrocities.  When they destroyed the Warsaw ghetto, they even <br>
made movies of it.  On page 106 of *The Hoax of the 20th Century,* <br>
Arthur Butz shows a picture of a mass grave at Belsen (which everyone <br>
should look at, as a reality check).  If Butz found a picture of interlaced <br>
corpses in one of the gas chambers at Birkenau, he would print it.  <br>
So would Michael Shermer.  So would everybody.  But there are no <br>
such photographs.      <br>
<p>
Michael keeps talking about "convergence of evidence."  The problem <br>
here is that the evidence does not converge.  The mosaic-like pieces <br>
don't give us a complete picture of the crime.  We have a series of <br>
pictures which approach the gas chambers from both directions, before <br>
and after.  They approach but they do not meet in the middle.  We have <br>
pictures of prisoners arriving at the camp, and pictures of bodies being <br>
cremated, but nothing in between.  There are no photographs of the <br>
gassing operation itself.  That part (the essential part!) of the mosaic <br>
is missing, so the series does not converge.  <br>
<p>
If there were photographs or movies of the gassing operation, then <br>
there would be no such thing as revisionism.  Likewise, if there were <br>
rooms in the ruins of Auschwitz that looked like the gas chambers in <br>
American prisons, revisionism would be impossible.  If there were <br>
records of the construction of gas chambers (as there are for the <br>
construction of crematoria), revisionism would be impossible.  If there <br>
were any documentation at all, any references by Himmler, Hitler, or <br>
anyone else to gas chambers, then revisionism would be impossible.  <br>
<p>
Revisionism is possible only because there is a total lack of physical, <br>
photographic, or documentary evidence for gas chambers.  <br>
<p>
If someone hadn't already heard about the gas chambers, he wouldn't <br>
learn about them from the speeches of Hitler, Himmler, and the other <br>
Nazis, nor from the photographs of the camps, nor from the documents <br>
describing the camps, nor from examining the remains of the camps.  <br>
A naive person investigating this subject would have no indication <br>
whatever that there were gas chambers, if all he had to go on was <br>
non-witness evidence.  One hears about gas chambers *only* from the <br>
statements of Broad, Hoess, Nyiszli, and other such witnesses.  <br>
<p>
That's why I refer you to the Nyiszli book, which is by far the most <br>
accessible of the witness statements.  Judge for yourself.  <br>
