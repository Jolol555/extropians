No, I don't think we are. My apologies for misunderstanding you Sarah.<br>
<p>
The recent discussion on spontaneous order encouraged me to do more thinking<br>
about whether Spontaneous Order should be one the Extropian Principles. I've<br>
been considering removing that as a principle for well over a year now. The<br>
confusion about the idea, its lack of immediate comprehensibility by most<br>
people (anyone without a substantial theoretical background in certain<br>
areas), and the lack of clarity in the concept (e.g. it might imply that<br>
Extropians like *all* spontaneous orders and their products), have all led<br>
me to decide that it's time to remove this as a Principle.<br>
<p>
I've been thinking about the structure of the next version of the Principles<br>
since v. 2.5 were completed. Version 3.0 should be done before long. What to<br>
do about Spontaneous Order has been one of the delays. I've now decided:<br>
Spontaneous Order will be replaced be the Principle of: Self-Ownership.<br>
<p>
I was anticipating an expansion in the number of principles from five to<br>
probably seven. Peter Voss made the good point that it's hard to remember<br>
more than four or five items in a list for most people. I now think there<br>
may be only *four* principles in version 3.0, but with sub-principles,<br>
values, and ideas, subsumed within each principle. I intend the new<br>
structure to make it much easier to explain the essentials of extropian<br>
thinking.<br>
<p>
More later...<br>
