<i>&gt;would be great, but so to would anyone with ideas about what to actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;put in this world - themes, ideas, concepts and how to present them in  an</i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting and aethetically pleasing manner.</i><br>
<p>
I'll get started on coming up with ideas for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- General meeting places - seaside/starside cafes, pavillions, forest</i><br>
clearings<br>
<i>&gt;Transhumanist Art galleries - basically anywhere.  Also have utility for</i><br>
<i>&gt;users to add there</i><br>
<i>&gt;own "rooms", or personal areas.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Institute of complexity - Place to explore all sorts of Java applets</i><br>
<i>&gt;dealing with fractals, a-life, cellular automata, genetic algorithms,</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary artwork, l-systems, neural networks, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Sit and watch the creatures in the a-life pool mutate and evolve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyways, just a few ideas of varying practicality and worth - anyone of</i><br>
<i>&gt;these could take years to develop in full, technicolor detail.  But if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;start off with the seeds of each, and just</i><br>
<i>&gt;have all sorts of people keep adding,adding, adding - it could all</i><br>
<i>&gt;come together into something quite formidable (That is if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;server doesn't crash long before - a good idea would be to eventually split</i><br>
<i>&gt;up initial world into subworlds that reside on different servers).</i><br>
<p>
Each personal space could be on their ISP's personal website space. This is<br>
the exact reason why I said before that we should begin writing the<br>
descriptions of the virtual worlds we'd like to live in. Eventually this<br>
simple VRML world will evolve into our uploaded living realm and we will be<br>
able to sit around and remember the days when we first designed the world<br>
on pathetic low-speed computers and how structures in the world have<br>
evolved since.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, I realize a lot of this sounds ambitious, but basically the only areas</i><br>
<i>&gt;that are holding us back are faster physical connections to Internet,</i><br>
<i>&gt;fleshing out multi-user VRML, and development of autonomous agents. But with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the rapid rate of development (Moore's Law), I expect to see 3D worlds</i><br>
<i>&gt;become "cool places to be" as early as a year or two from now. </i><br>
<p>
Hey you may be right on the money. US Robotics is releasing the new X2<br>
56kbps modem which recieves data at 56kbps Jan 97.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Which leaves a lot of time to develop our worlds offline.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Basically it's a win/win - the longer it takes for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the 3D Web revolution to happen, the longer it gives</i><br>
<i>&gt;us to perfect our creations.  If it happens earlier,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we can just add areas piecemeal.)</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So if any of this grabs your fancy, just e-mail me.  I'm hoping</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have a sample world up when I put up my web-page in a month or so.</i><br>
<p>
Great! Allow users to download it for offline viewing too so more people<br>
can see it.<br>
