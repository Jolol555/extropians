Dan Clemmonson:  <br>
<i>&gt; With MNT, it will be a lot easier for an individual </i><br>
<i>&gt; to produce an item than it is now. </i><br>
<i>&gt; ...An individual will be able to produce </i><br>
<i>&gt; essentially everything needed for a lavish lifestyle, </i><br>
<i>&gt; with none of the costs associated with trade. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's certainly the case that MNT "universal assemblers" </i><br>
<i>&gt; can build most items with no input other than matter and energy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is efficiently done by "re-tooling" as necessary, </i><br>
<i>&gt; building tools to build tools to ultimately build the desired article. </i><br>
<p>
Rich Artym:  <br>
<i>&gt; Once the means of production can be tailored at will </i><br>
<i>&gt; and replicated at the point of need, </i><br>
<i>&gt; production itself is no longer limited by capital and manpower, </i><br>
<i>&gt; only by the presence of the required feedstock and energy.  </i><br>
<p>
I'm going to call this idea Extropian Nanotech.  <br>
<p>
As a first step towards calibration of this idea, try comparing it <br>
with other processes that are similar in some ways:   <br>
<p>
- a termite colony building an ant hill<br>
- an orange tree growing an orange <br>
- a cedar tree growing wood to be used for lumber <br>
- a water purification plant, in which bacteria remove <br>
       certain contaminants from the water<br>
- an electric eel generating an electric potential <br>
- a firefly generating light <br>
- a cicada generating sound <br>
<p>
These analogies calibrate Extropian Nanotech only in the sense that they <br>
all involve replicating organisms producing various effects.  All these <br>
analogies are missing something -- the idea of a system that can do <br>
everything at once, in one place.  The following hypothetical projects <br>
are a closer calibration for Extropian Nanotech:  <br>
<p>
- an entomologist creating general-purpose (reprogrammable) termites, <br>
       which could build any kind of building (or tunnel, etc), to spec.<br>
- a biologist creating a general-purpose (reprogrammable) <br>
        orchard, which would grow all kinds of fruit in a small space.<br>
- a biologist creating a general-purpose (reprogrammable) <br>
        tree, which would grow any specified kind of wood <br>
- a biologist creating a general-purpose (reprogrammable) <br>
        hydroponic garden, which would grow all the food for a household <br>
- a biologist creating a general-purpose filter, using bacteria, fungi, <br>
        and/or green plants, to take any ion out of any solution<br>
- a biologist creating a general purpose energy-generating organism, <br>
        which can produce whatever kind of energy you need -- <br>
        light, electricity, sound, heat, etc.  <br>
<p>
Now we have gotten a very good calibration; what I have just described <br>
is almost isomorphic to Extropian Nanotech.  If you ponder these <br>
projects slowly enough to get them in focus, you can get an excellent <br>
idea of what is going to be involved in Extropian Nanotech.  <br>
<p>
How much would you have to know about termites, their society, <br>
their genome, etc., before you could make them reprogrammable and <br>
able to build structures to spec?  How long would this take?  Whatever <br>
the answer is, Extropian Nanotech will require about the same time, <br>
because it amounts to the same thing.  Nanites may not physically <br>
resemble termites, but they will have a genome that will be comparable <br>
to the genome of a termite, and their society will be as complex as a <br>
termite colony.  Creating nanites is isomorphic to creating <br>
reprogrammable termites.  Everything that has to be done in one case <br>
has to be done in the other.  <br>
<p>
Likewise for all the other projects on the list.  What would be involved <br>
in creating a general purpose energy-generating organism?  How long <br>
would this take?  Extropian Nanotech will take that long, too, because <br>
you will have to do something that amounts to the same thing.  <br>
You will have to find ways to generate all kinds of energy at the <br>
atomic level, and incorporate these mechanisms into replicating entities.  <br>
Your task is isomorphic to the biologist's task.  <br>
<p>
However, your task requires another step that the biologist <br>
doesn't have to worry about:  instead of modifying existing organisms <br>
and their cellular machinery to make materials, generate electricity, <br>
and so forth, you are going to use atomic machinery invented de novo, <br>
based on Eric Drexler's diamondoid constructors and replicators.  <br>
You have to do that before you can even start the higher-level projects <br>
discussed above.  <br>
<p>
Thus, to create Extropian Nanotechnology, you have to do everything <br>
the biologists have to do in the projects listed above, *plus* design a <br>
new kind of replicating entity, and all the necessary atomic machinery.   <br>
<p>
The last step in calibration is to write a computer simulation of <br>
Extropian Nanotechnology.  Instead of actually moving carbon atoms <br>
into their places in a diamondoid structure, you move simulated atoms <br>
from place to place in memory, and watch this happening on the <br>
monitor.  Everything that happens in a complete Home Nanotech <br>
Facility is represented in the simulation.  This means both atomic level <br>
processes, and also higher level processes, such as nanites making a <br>
tunnel, or a tree reprogramming itself to produce oak instead of <br>
cedar wood.  Everything described in the biology projects listed above, <br>
plus all the new diamondoid machinery, is simulated.  The retooling <br>
mentioned by Dan Clemmenson is also simulated.  If any part of the <br>
nanosystem is going to be evolved, rather than designed, that process of <br>
evolution is also simulated.  <br>
<p>
If you imagine writing the code required for the Nanotech simulation, <br>
you have a very good calibration of the Nanotech project itself.   <br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg:  <br>
<i>&gt; I think hyperchess has the drawback that it is an extremely complex </i><br>
<i>&gt; game;  how many entities are good enough at chess and cognitive </i><br>
<i>&gt; science to play it well?  </i><br>
<p>
Hyperchess is orders of magnitude easier than the Nanotech simulation.  <br>
At some point in the Nanotech project, you are going to have to write <br>
software, similar to a CAD program, to help you design atomic structures.  <br>
This will be more or less isomorphic to hyperchess.  This is just <br>
one little part of the whole project, something I didn't even bother to <br>
mention in my discussion above.  <br>
