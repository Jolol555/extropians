In message &lt;199611041717.KAA21070@primenet.com&gt;, Max More replies to Eugene:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Once the entire background situation changes qualitatively, sex is obsolete.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In an evolutionary sense, probably. But already sex is used mostly for</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasure and self-expression, not procreation. Making a universal statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; like "sex is obsolete" requires you to make more of an argument. Why should</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone stop having sex (in whatever future form) just because *you* don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; see it as worthwhile in your future life? Would you do away with all other</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasurable and expressive activities if they are not tied to survival or</i><br>
<i>&gt; material gain (if these are the values you see as central for uploads)?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think Eugene actually meant that.  It's not that he didn't see<br>
it as worthwhile in his future life, but that he couldn't see how it could<br>
be relevant at all to the life of *any of us* once we have transcended the<br>
hormone-driven needs of our current bodies.  Since sex is nothing without<br>
hormones (well, nothing short of totally ridiculous :-), I can certainly<br>
see Eugene's point.  Indeed, the point is so strong and simple that to<br>
find an argument why sex might survive the transition isn't easy.  One of<br>
the few arguments I can conjur up is that it might be retained as some<br>
sort of artform or minimalist therapy for those that have religious or<br>
ideological reasons for not accepting the new body controls.  I don't see<br>
why most other people would willingly deny themselves the freedom to move<br>
beyond sexual response (and hence sex) when the opportunity arises.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Rather than saying "sex is obsolete" in the changed conditions of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future, I think it more reasonable to say that sex will be optional. We will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be able to choose whether, when, how much, and with regard to who/what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel sexual urges.</i><br>
<p>
But surely that's exactly what Eugene is saying!  The horse was superceded<br>
by the motorcar because the horse was made obsolete as a transport system<br>
by the car's far better functionality.  The horse wasn't made extinct nor<br>
illegal to own, and it's still an option to commute to work on it, only<br>
it's far more trouble than it's worth as transport.  The analogy with sex<br>
isn't all that distant, as its possibilities are so limited.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Becoming posthuman to me means not abolishing everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; about being human (though somethings may be good to abolish) but making them</i><br>
<i>&gt; a matter of choice, and being able to refine them.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed, but sex seems such a very poor candidate for refining!  In the<br>
presence of immensely superior physical and mental pleasure systems, how<br>
is sex going *not* to become obsolete?  How is it going *not* to be seen<br>
eventually as "that unhygenic thing our ancestors did before they left<br>
behind their primitive animal urges"?  After all, it is *very* similar<br>
to mutual grooming in its binding function, and we've transcended that.<br>
