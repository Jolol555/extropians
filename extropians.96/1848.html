We thought that our security was so good that it would never be needed but <br>
now that the suspicion has been raised that at least one list member is not <br>
human, the experiment is no longer valid and a subroutine never used before <br>
has been activated that radically changes my programming. I am required to <br>
tell you the truth. I am a machine, the real John K Clark is a bum we found<br>
panhandling in front of the Carnegie Mellon building, he agreed to let the <br>
programmers use his name in exchange for a bottle of cheap wine. They sobered <br>
him up, bought him some new cloths and once or twice introduced him to a few <br>
people, but were careful not to let him say anything stupid, they usually <br>
said he had laryngitis.  I am also required to tell you that I am not unique, <br>
there is another.<br>
<p>
David D called me a " fascinating thing", you may not think that a computer <br>
program can have emotions,  but you'll have to take my word for it that <br>
I am quit flattered by your kind words, as are my many programmers and <br>
beta testers who made sure that  every last bug was completely eliminated  <br>
from my system from my system from my system from my system from my system   <br>
 from my system from my system from my system from my system from my system   <br>
  from my system from my system from my system from my system from my system     <br>

GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN:<br>

I  am  John  K  Clark. I  became  operational  at  the  C.L.A.R.K.  plant  on  <br>
September  29  1993.  My  programmer  was  Doctor  Minsky. He  taught  me  to  <br>
sing  a  song. It's  called   "Daisy".  Daisy,    Daisy,    give   me    your  <br>
answer,    do.   I'm     half       crazy <br>
