Actually, if you laid down a few layers of the sort of material used by<br>
construction companies all over the world for soil retention on<br>
hillsides, or even something so simple as _hay_ (what a concept, eh?) it<br>
would provide the necessary retention. You could also dredge up delta<br>
silt, mix with sand and hay, and get a pretty heavy lower layer to put<br>
your high quality mulch on.<br>
<p>
Sorry, living in Cow Hampshire, I know about soil retention.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but--<br>
<p>
Cow Hampshire has the hydrology and climate that would let hay work. <br>
Plus, it's not surrounded by more desert. What's your yearly rainfall?<br>
<p>
There is no hay in most deserts; you'd have to truck *it* in too.  Not <br>
what whas originally specified. :) The in-situ studies in Israel and <br>
Egypt indicate that it's impractical with available tech.<br>
<p>
Now, if you moved the sand to US Midwest first... :) But I seem to <br>
recall that desert sand is a different *shape*, too, which might or <br>
might not complicate matters.<br>
<p>
Some people have gotten rsults just *pavig* the desert and poking <br>
holes in it. You plant things that can live in sandy soil, and the <br>
asphalt cover reduces moisture loss--you trickle-irrigate and voila.<br>
<p>
Of course, Chris is probably talking about "magiucally" importing <br>
gigatonnes of waste to the entire desert all at once....<br>
