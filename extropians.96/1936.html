<i>&gt;&gt; don't understand is why it isn't blatently obvious to Suresh that private</i><br>
property is only maintained by force *when others try to forcefully take it<br>
 from the rightful owner*.<br>
<p>
David, being of native American heritage, that sentnce stuck in my craw.  It<br>
is your use of the word only.... maybe you should say "rightly"... In the<br>
USA, the land was taken by force and is still maintained by superior force.<br>
How land is "taken" in the first place may be a good  place to begin to<br>
analyze of some of our culture's deficient memes.  When members of<br>
technologically superior yet unethical (for example if they don't regard<br>
Indians or blacks as "human beings" but as, say, beasts in the field - which<br>
is something the Spanish Christian Missionaries had up their sleeve ie: to be<br>
slaughtered or  converted and enslaved was their "place" in life) or<br>
illmotivated 'tribes' take land by force, then keep it by force, it starts a<br>
Might is Right chain.<br>
<p>
This has less to do with capitalism, politics, it has much more to do with<br>
ethics and morality. It may be less of a successful guise today to  take<br>
land, money and gold, but does one think it still effects on us today? Do<br>
people still operate in this manner? The church is still here, the state is<br>
still here. In most cases, monarchy is not. But Might is Right is a basic,<br>
we've been doing it for years and anarchy has never been tried.  Do we<br>
passively assume such tyrannies wil dissapear overnight because we get less<br>
govt.  or do we have to do something (if one can do anything).<br>
