Geologists can't do much more.  Drill away, all we know about the core<br>
is from seismology, and is dependent on the whims of earthquakes.  It's<br>
amazing what we claim to know about the Earth -- or sun, similar<br>
techniques -- based on waves bouncing around, with nothing anybody would<br>
normally consider real evidence.<br>
<p>
And no, social scientists can't control every variable of the humans<br>
coming into an experiment.  You can't control the exact state of a gas,<br>
either, but we've found we can control what matters.  Why is it so hard<br>
to believe that social science could be making analogous progress?<br>
Perhaps because we don't notice much evidence of it, but that could<br>
indicate (a) progress is slow, because people are complex, but still<br>
happening; or (b) we don't know anything about the subject, but feel free<br>
to mouth off about it.<br>
