Last night I wrote, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is something I have never talked about, </i><br>
<p>
This morning it occurred to me that I wrote a similar post a few months <br>
ago.  Is something affecting my memory?  Hmm...  <br>
<p>
T.0.Morrow writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm familiar with a case of someone similarly taking a 1/4 street dose </i><br>
<i>&gt; of LSD-25 during a second attempt at the ACT (a test quite similar to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the SAT).  The auto-experimental subject allegedly had done well the </i><br>
<i>&gt; first time--in the 90 percentiles--but got a 99 %-tile score the second </i><br>
<i>&gt; time through.  So far as I can tell, moreover, the person in question </i><br>
<i>&gt; remains bright and lucid.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This interesting anecdote hardly qualifies as a double-blind study, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, but it does (if true) disprove over-broad claims about </i><br>
<i>&gt; LSD-25's allegedly universal and harmful effects.</i><br>
<p>
In case it wasn't clear from my post, I am not making any claims <br>
about universal harmful effects.  Acid, like all drugs, affects different <br>
people in different ways, and affects the same person in different ways <br>
at different times.  For some people, acid may be just what the doctor <br>
ordered.  At the Esalen seminar, one night we were sitting around and <br>
somebody brought up the question of how old we were.  It turned out <br>
that most of us (except for Terence himself) were quite a bit older than <br>
we appeared.  One man said he was 50, which we all found hard to <br>
believe.  He looked 35.  One woman said she was 42, and she looked to <br>
be in her 20s.  (Remember this is Esalen -- hot tubs -- I *know* what <br>
she looked like!)  These people were mushroom eaters from way back. <br>
(Except for me -- I had probably done less psychedelics than anybody <br>
there, but I ate a lot of brownies in those days.) <br>
<p>
The problem is, there is no way to tell in advance whether you are <br>
going to be one of those people who get long-term benefits from taking <br>
acid, or one of those on whom it has a neutral effect, or one of those <br>
who end up wasting a decade of their lives.  <br>
<p>
I am not surprised at what Max and Tom report about test scores.    <br>
Acid can also improve physical dexterity.  It can have all kinds of <br>
wonderful effects, *during the trip*.    <br>
<p>
As for being bright and lucid -- for a long time I insisted that <br>
I was as bright and lucid as I had ever been.  Now I know that I was <br>
kidding myself.  Sometimes it's very hard to be objective about oneself, <br>
especially when a belief system is at stake.  <br>
<p>
Mark Crosby adds, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I had a very similar experience, though I never felt that I was a </i><br>
<i>&gt; casualty of drug usage, it was mostly a lack of coherent purpose from </i><br>
<i>&gt; too many nihilistic memes.  </i><br>
<p>
I think it was my basically healthy "memes" (I'm getting very leery of <br>
that word) that kept me going.  I always had faith in myself.  I always <br>
knew that the "towel-in-the-refrigerator-door" syndrome only affected <br>
the shell, not the kernel.  <br>
