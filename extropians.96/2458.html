<p>
Right.  You want to have the last word.  Typical female tactic.  <br>
You're not going to get away with it.  <br>
<p>
In reply to my statement, <br>
<p>
:: Leslie didn't have a great mind, but in her limited way <br>
:: she was a real artist, not a "political" artist.  <br>
<p>
The Queene says:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That is BAITING of the first order, Lyle, there is </i><br>
<i>&gt; no such thing as being either one and you know it.  </i><br>
<p>
T.S. Eliot said this about Henry James:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; He had a mind so fine that no idea could violate it.  </i><br>
<p>
I read this remark as a student and was mystified by it.  What on earth <br>
did Eliot mean?  Now I think I understand.  <br>
<p>
Some artists start with an ism, and try to have the right thoughts <br>
as defined by their ism.  They have the right thoughts about sex, <br>
about race, about various other things.  And then they draw pictures, <br>
write stories, etc with the intention of making their audience also <br>
have the right thoughts.  This is political art.  <br>
<p>
Other artists see isms as constraints to be escaped from.  A real artist <br>
has no sacred cows or isms or ideas.  A real artist cuts through all kinds <br>
of political cant and is willing to entertain thoughts that no one else <br>
would dare to think.  A real artist just produces art, and lets the political <br>
chips fall where they may.  <br>
<p>
I'm not saying this distinction is always easy to make, nor that real <br>
artists are always better than political artists.  Some political artists <br>
produce very good work, and most "real" artists are not in the same <br>
league with Henry James.  But there is a distinction between the two <br>
kinds of art.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But Lyle you said your miracle didn't involve any mystic</i><br>
<i>&gt; event!  What about the resurection she had to have to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; your slave?  Has there been some new South African breakthrough </i><br>
<i>&gt; involving dead beauties?  </i><br>
<p>
She was my slave off and on for a couple of years, in 1990-91.  <br>
She died in 1995.  You're just jealous because you want me to <br>
put YOU on the rack.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
