I wasn't quarreling with Chris Hind out of pessimism or sheer<br>
orneriness.  I simply take issue with the statements he has<br>
made regarding its utility.  I've seen this issue cycle a number of<br>
times over the last few years.  I really would like to be proven wrong.<br>
<p>
Saying this,<br>
however, I _am_ heartened that the Extropians mailing list<br>
itself has opened up, in that it's now practical and within<br>
list charter to copy the newsgroup on interesting threads.<br>
This was impractical before.  Maybe this will change things.<br>
Maybe the increased general visibility of extropianism will<br>
contribute.<br>
<p>
It's yet to be determined who wins, though: topical posters<br>
or netspammers.  It's the mechanism itself which presents<br>
this vulnerability.<br>
