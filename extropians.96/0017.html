<p>
I agree that monopolies and oligopolies are not desirable in many cases, <br>
but I would argue that oligopolies (based on merit, not unfair business <br>
practices) can sometimes be helpful.  For instance, it would not be <br>
desirable for software developers to have to write software which <br>
runs on and supports 50 different operating systems in order to get <br>
enough customers to make a profit.  Settling on a small number of <br>
operating systems made by only a few companies (or a single company in <br>
this case) reduces the amount of overhead required to get software out <br>
the door.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I look at this being a by-product of monetary system. Money originally</i><br>
<i>&gt; was what I'd call an "enabling technology". It filled a purpose,</i><br>
<i>&gt; namely enabling a freer flow of products and services. It has had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; down-side effect, namely that most things are now done for the sake of</i><br>
<i>&gt; making money. This is not particularly an efficient way to go about</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing things, and I would argue results in a lot of wasted time,</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort, and money. Problems may get solved, but if the solution was</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a good idea, why couldn't it have been achieved without money as</i><br>
<i>&gt; motivation?</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  The overhead of a money based system isn't desirable.  <br>
Unfortunately is seems that this is a necessary tradeoff in order to get <br>
the flexibility which money provides.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been doing some writing recently on planned economies. The Soviet</i><br>
<i>&gt; Union was a good example of a planned economy gone wrong. Is a planned</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy workable at all? I'm not entirely convinced it isn't. I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; the major problem with the Soviet economy was that the control was too</i><br>
<i>&gt; fine grained. It's too complicated to try to design a system where</i><br>
<i>&gt; every aspect of the flow of money is controlled. The patterns are too</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex, there are too many interactions, and the act of controlling</i><br>
<i>&gt; those flows changes the flows themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The economic system "in the West" could have been designed, but only</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a high level:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Assume that a system of trade currently exists (e.g., barter)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Create a token (physical) which represents some amount of work or</i><br>
<i>&gt;   product</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Have people accept the token as valid (this is the hard part</i><br>
<i>&gt;   initially)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * People can put a value (based in tokens) on any product or</i><br>
<i>&gt;   service they produce.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; From here, I would claim you could predict monopolies, slave labour,</i><br>
<i>&gt; misers, paid employment (as opposed to entrepreneurs), investment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc. It wouldn't predict interest per se, though if you got as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt; banks, you might come up with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In my "ideal planned economy", I would have several goals:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * guaranteed food and shelter (some how -- guaranteed doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;   necessarily mean that some benevolent government is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   involved. Extended families, as opposed to the more recent idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the nuclear family, promote this sort of "social safety net")</i><br>
<p>
By "Extended families" do you mean the local community or do you simply <br>
mean blood-relatives that aren't as closely related as those in a nuclear <br>
family?  If it's the latter, how do you "plan" for an economy which <br>
encourages blood-relatives to be more willing to share food and shelter <br>
than they are now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * community-level money systems which augment a more socialist (in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   true sense of the word) system. The exchange of goods for services,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   services for services, and goods for goods (i.e., barter) is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;   efficient</i><br>
<p>
Barter?  It may be efficient in the sense that the handling of money is <br>
avoided, but this means that I would have to produce something which is <br>
wanted or needed by everyone which I want or need anything from.  In many <br>
fields, specialization is becoming more and more important because of <br>
the complexity involved in many tasks.  It would difficult to imagine <br>
how a brain surgeon would be able to trade his/her skills in order to <br>
buy toothbrushes, lawn mowers, and kitchen appliences.  Would this brain <br>
surgeon have to operate on the CEO of Sony in order to get a CD player?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it's fairly obvious that the attitudes of people living in</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a system would be different from these we see today. The main</i><br>
<i>&gt; point I make with this is that the economy we have today has</i><br>
<i>&gt; essentially zero planning associated with it. As a society, we have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; common goals which drive us to do anything. And given the scale of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy we share, I don't think that's possible. Generating small</i><br>
<i>&gt; micro-economies where people involved have common goals may be an</i><br>
<i>&gt; "evolutionary stable strategy" (using Dawkins terms) to eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt; replace the existing economy. Communes, cooperatives, small</i><br>
<i>&gt; communities of people with common goals. I would suggest that the main</i><br>
<i>&gt; point is that if you want to achieve something, you need to plan for</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieving those goals, that it won't happen spontaneously *because* of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the complexity involved. In the existing economy we already have</i><br>
<i>&gt; examples of this happening, in the form of corporations, which act as</i><br>
<i>&gt; a micro-economy where the people involved work towards a common goal</i><br>
<i>&gt; (this doesn't say anything of whether those people really care for</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they are producing, and the "common goal" is more often than not</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make money -- try saying something else and get investment!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Over and out</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -Oliver</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It's true that there are many people (including me) who consider their <br>
career (or future career) to be a reward in and of itself.  It's also <br>
true that many organizations are able to foster a feeling of pride for <br>
the things that the organization produces and/or does.  However, there's <br>
a rather large number of people out there who perform their work simply <br>
for the "individual goal" of getting money so that they can enhance other <br>
areas of their lives.  It seems that these people wouldn't be working for <br>
a common goal.<br>
<p>
<p>
Getting rid of the rather large overhead of a money-based economy is <br>
certainly a good goal, but it's important to make sure that the <br>
flexibility of money isn't given up in the process.  It's important that <br>
everyone be able to provide goods and services which can be traded for <br>
ANY other good or service.  Money is the intermediary which currently <br>
allows us to do this.<br>
<p>
If I have misinterpreted your plan for a socialist economy please correct <br>
me.  I just don't see how the flexibility of money can be achieved without <br>
some form of intermediary which has no intrinsic value.<br>
