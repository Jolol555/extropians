There have been several articles in Science magazine about the martian<br>
meteorites. Smoe of teh articles have discussed the energetics and<br>
balistics<br>
of the transfer of the material from Mars' surface to earth. Basically,<br>
a large<br>
bolide struck Mars, "splashing" the material laterally off the surface,<br>
through<br>
the thin martian atmosphere, an out into space in excess of martian<br>
escape<br>
velocity. (Assuming that I understood the articles correctly and that I<br>
remember<br>
them correctly.)  Thus, transfer of material from Mars to Eath is<br>
feasible.<br>
<p>
I don't recall a discussion of whetern or not such a transfer is<br>
compatible<br>
with the preservation of bacterial life, but it's not inconcievable. I<br>
don't<br>
think acceleration or even shock is a mojor issue for rock-dwelling<br>
bacteria.<br>
the problems would be heat (at launch and re-entry) and dessication and<br>
radiation (in space).<br>
<p>
The situation for Earth-to-Mars transfer is a lot less favorable, for<br>
three<br>
reasons: Earth has higher gravity, Earth has (and apparently has had) a<br>
much<br>
denser atmosphere, and Earth is nearer to the sun. For all three<br>
reasons, it's<br>
a lot harder to get a rock from earth to Mars without starting with<br>
enough energy to melt it.<br>
<p>
Panspermia requires a much longer time in space than Mars-to-Earth<br>
infection. Thus, Mars-to-earth infection is much more probable than<br>
either Earth-to-Mars infection or infection from a common source, IMO.<br>
