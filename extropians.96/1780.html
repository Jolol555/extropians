This is indeed an interesting thought experiment.  My suspicion is that<br>
the<br>
time between being granted such miraculous machinery, and the emergence<br>
of superintelligence would be exceedingly short.  On the order of weeks<br>
for one such as myself who only programs occasionally, perhaps only days<br>
for an experienced programmer who does it as his primary method of<br>
making a living, possibly even hours for a first class programming<br>
wizard (especially one with a passion for mathematics).<br>
<p>
The reason I think that such a short time scale is possible is that the<br>
feat could perhaps be achieved by creating a program, or more likely an<br>
interacting group of competing programs, that evolves on it's own once<br>
set in operation.  With unlimited computing resources (or at least<br>
enough to seem unlimited by modern standards), this initial population<br>
of virtual life would not need to be particularly efficient or effective<br>
in it's evolutionary progress.  It would only have to meet these<br>
requirements:<br>
<p>
   1. it could not permanently stagnate at any particular level of<br>
      development<br>
   2. it could not get into any kind of degenerative "devolution" mode<br>
      (or at least, such occurrences would have to be outweighed by<br>
      development in a positive direction)<br>
<p>
With truly immense computing power to play with, reiterative testing and<br>
modification of starting populations would be easily accomplished, so<br>
all false starts could provide valuable clues towards a functional<br>
solution.  And the first initial population to successfully achieve the<br>
above conditions would be an instant success.  With infinite computing<br>
resources, a superintelligence would exist as soon as the first<br>
successful program is set in motion.  It seems to me that the only<br>
limitation of the development of such an intelligent virtual lifeform<br>
would be imposed by the limitations of the available computer.  I cannot<br>
concieve of what kind of intelligence could evolve in a computer that<br>
was infinitely fast and with infinite memory.  But even with very large,<br>
but still finite resources, it is easy to imagine that the potential for<br>
such a virtual life scenario is awesome.<br>
