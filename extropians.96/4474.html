PRESS RELEASE   [excerpts]<br>
===========================<br>
<p>
CUPERTINO, Calif.--Dec. 20, 1996--Apple Computer, Inc. today  <br>
announced its intention to purchase NeXT Software Inc., in a friendly  <br>
acquisition for $400 million. Pending regulatory approvals, all NeXT  <br>
products, services, and technology research will become part of  <br>
Apple Computer, Inc. As part of the agreement, Steve Jobs, Chairman  <br>
and CEO of NeXT Software, will return to Apple--the company he  <br>
co-founded in 1976--reporting to Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's  <br>
Chairman and CEO.<br>
<p>
Gilbert Amelio:  <br>
"The acquisition of NeXT is the start of a new chapter in Apple's  <br>
history and represents a milestone in our transformation as a  <br>
corporation," said Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Chairman and CEO, Apple  <br>
Computer Inc. "Today Apple welcomed back its most talented  <br>
visionary--Steve Jobs, someone who can inspire a new generation of  <br>
customers and software developers and show that Apple remains the  <br>
industry home for innovation and excitement.  Today Apple returns, <br>
as an open player to the mainstream and the heart of this industry,  <br>
where our technology can once more set standards for innovation and  <br>
excellence."<br>
<p>
Steve Jobs: <br>
"Much of the industry has lived off the Macintosh for over ten years  <br>
now, slowly copying the Mac's revolutionary user interface," <br>
said Steven P. Jobs.  "Now the time has come for new innovation, <br>
and where better than Apple for this to spring from?  Who else <br>
has consistently led this industry -- first with the Apple II, then the <br>
Macintosh and LaserWriter?  With this merger, the advanced software <br>
from NeXT will be married with Apple's very high-volume hardware <br>
platforms and marketing channels to create another breakthrough, <br>
leapfrogging existing platforms, and fueling Apple and the <br>
industry copy cats for the next ten years and beyond.  I still have <br>
very deep feelings for Apple, and it gives me great joy to play a role <br>
in architecting Apple's future."<br>
<p>
John Warnock:  <br>
"This partnership is the best possible fit.  Both companies support  <br>
strong, open industry standards.  Combined with their rich media focus  <br>
and a command of the Internet, these strengths will play well into  <br>
Adobe's core markets," says John Warnock, Chairman and CEO, <br>
Adobe Systems, Inc. "NeXT's advanced operating system design, <br>
when combined with Apple's leadership in ease-of-use and multimedia, <br>
will provide Adobe and other developers with a robust, compelling <br>
platform on which to build great next-generation software solutions."<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
... the momentum of Java, Sun Microsystems' platform-independent <br>
programming language, has led Apple to conclude that by <br>
implementing a Java architecture across its platforms and development <br>
tools portfolio, Apple systems will be at the forefront  <br>
of Internet/Intranet design--an area of enormous potential growth  <br>
through the millennium.<br>
<p>
Apple's exhaustive research in operating system design(!!!) led the <br>
company to conclude that NEXTSTEP's maturity, networking, <br>
customer and developer acceptance(!!!!!), multi-tasking, protected <br>
memory, and scalability from portable to server-level products make it <br>
the clear choice for integration into the next major revision of Mac OS. <br>
Apple believes that the integration of NEXTSTEP technology in <br>
future versions of Mac OS will result in a robust, next generation OS <br>
that provides customers and developers with a multimedia-rich and  <br>
Internet-savvy platform.<br>
<p>
Apple Chairman and CEO Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Chief Technology  <br>
Officer Ellen Hancock, and Steve Jobs will announce details of <br>
how Apple will incorporate NeXT technology into future releases of <br>
Mac OS  at MacWorld San Francisco in January.<br>
