Lyle Burkhead related his story of being an "acid casuality", and this got me <br>
thinking about my experiences with acid and whether using LSD seemed to <br>
improve my life or not.  I've had some really wonderful "bliss trips" and some <br>
very frightening and traumatic experiences while on acid.  During all my <br>
experiences with acid, I learned a lot about my belief systems and my <br>
attitudes, and all the acid really seemed to do was to magnify and clarify all <br>
my thinking and help me work through whatever I had been thinking about during <br>
the time when I took the acid.  During my trips, I generally got a lot of <br>
mental work done very quickly and worked through a lot of personal problems <br>
and psychological weakensses very quickly.  Even my most traumatic trips ended <br>
up on a positive note, once I worked my way out of the terror I was <br>
experiencing.  But I think my positive results from using acid are because of <br>
my typical attitudes of making the best of my situation and making every <br>
experience something to learn from.  With a different set of attitudes, the <br>
acid may have had a negative effect on me.<br>
<p>
I stongly believe that all the results of using LSD can be achieved without <br>
the drug, and I have been working on developing the types of states of mind <br>
that I experienced on LSD, for the past few years, with great success.  I <br>
think that LSD and other psychoactive drugs are only one way to achieve <br>
certain results with one's mind.  I think it is more beneficial to develop the <br>
mental discipline to put oneself in various states of consciousness at will <br>
(although I have nothing against using the drugs -- in fact, I enjoy using <br>
them, but haven't for a while, due to the difficulty of obtaining them <br>
safely).  It's taken a lot of work, but my everyday experience now is far <br>
beyond anything I ever experienced on acid, and it keeps getting more intense <br>
all the time.<br>
<p>
I feel like I'm on a perpetual acid trip now.  All the beautiful and enjoyable <br>
aspects of my acid trips I've learned to create in my normal experience.  The <br>
extreme vividness of all my sensations.  The intense fascination with every <br>
detail of experience.  Seeing everything with a fresh mind.  The rapid pace of <br>
learning new things.  The creative and fantastic ideas constantly flowing <br>
through my mind.  The feeling of the ground being perpetually yanked out from <br>
under my feet as new, more extensive and powerful paradigms develop in my mind <br>
and obsolete my current ones.  All of this, and much more are part of my <br>
ordinary experience.  This is the result of me deliberately creating these <br>
states of mind within myself by working diligently on it for the past few <br>
years.  I wanted it so much that I just kept pursuing it, and now I've <br>
attained it.  Now that I've got it, I want more. I want things to be more <br>
intense and fascinating.  I want to learn things even faster.  More vividness! <br>
 More frequent and profound paradigm shifts!  These states of mind are the <br>
most addictive things I've ever encountered, and I just keep wanting more.  <br>
And I keep enjoying everything more profoundly and understanding everything <br>
with greater clarity and doing everything with greater ease and gracefulness.<br>
<p>
It's just so endlessly fascinating...<br>
