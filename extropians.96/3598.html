An interesting resource I came across a few months ago is the Foundation for<br>
Critical Thinking, based in Santa Rosa. Their website is<br>
<a href="http://www.sonoma.edu/cthink/">http://www.sonoma.edu/cthink/</a><br>
<p>
I ordered a book they publish called _Critical Thinking: What Every Person<br>
Needs to Know to Survive in a Rapidly Changing World_ -- sounds like a<br>
Singularity survival guide ;-&gt; -- by Dr. Richard Paul, apparently one of the<br>
key members of the organisation. It's quite good, though as basically a<br>
collection of previously-published academic papers there's a fair amount of<br>
repetition in it. Paul really lays into the traditional North American K-12<br>
education system, so his target audience appears to be teachers and other<br>
educators. Worth reading, though.<br>
