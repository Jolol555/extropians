<i>&gt;That's exactly what hypothermia does. Continuing the hypothermia to low</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough temperatures slow all biological processes so much that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"hibernation" without decay for 100's of years is possible. If the organism</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be cooled to such temperatures without ice crystallization (a process</i><br>
<i>&gt;called vitrification) then no damage to the organism whatsoever occurs.</i><br>
<p>
Why can't they freeze, thaw, freeze, thaw like a domestic freezer?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I read a big article in Discover Magazine years ago (mid 80s) by a</i><br>
<i>&gt;doctor who had gone on a house call early in his career. When he got</i><br>
<i>&gt;there, he took care of the patient, then noticed a rather still</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual in a chair. "oh thats just grandpa" they said. He had a pulse</i><br>
<i>&gt;of one or two beats a minute. According to the family he had been this</i><br>
<i>&gt;way for a decade or so. Upon thyroid treatment, he was brought back to</i><br>
<i>&gt;normal metabolic rates, only to find that he was terminal with a large</i><br>
<i>&gt;tumor that had also been dormant during that period....</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like a twilight zone plot twist to me!<br>
