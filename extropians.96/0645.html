SPONTANEOUS GALAXIES<br>
<p>
<p>
A comet makes its way through the vast forbidding void<br>
A simple rock of ages -a flaming asteroid<br>
An aimless path is made to the soul that it must find<br>
Foreign to the body, familiar to the mind<br>
<p>
Why not walk a mile on two forgiving legs<br>
Relieve your eyes of the black box give them the freedom for which they beg<br>
Look to the stars and rid your bones of their unease<br>
See the distant symmetry of colliding galaxies<br>
<p>
Let your spirit soar to where the light of day runs dry<br>
Where Haley has no comet, Gallileo no 'magic' eye<br>
Feel your heart pound like the chorus of interstellar starbursts<br>
Where spontaneity is the key to great discoveries and firsts<br>
Fly on lucid wings that could never be seen<br>
Be the spatial paladin that none have ever been...<br>
<p>
Your heart is your solar rationality<br>
Gives you strength to hide the stars from those who try to see<br>
Guide your own way to celestial love<br>
Let the celerity of being lead you to beyond and far above<br>
<p>
Let your spirit soar to where the light of day runs dry<br>
Where Haley has no comet, Gallileo no 'magic' eye<br>
Feel your heart pound like the chorus of interstellar starbursts<br>
Where spontaneity is the key to great discoveries and firsts<br>
Fly on lucid wings that could never be seen<br>
Be the spatial paladin that none have ever been...<br>
<p>
Space may have a limit if logic is not true<br>
The answer of the cosmos lies deep inside you<br>
The world may have no meaning but don't let that thought deter<br>
You can create your own destiny -ride that far off meteor<br>

        Hope you enjoy!  BTW, I visted Sarah Marr's booklist recently.  She<br>
obviously has done a lot of work on the page, and it is well worth reading<br>
or submitting to.  Kudos, Sarah.<br>
