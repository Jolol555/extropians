<i>&gt;I worry about looking for simple criteria because I'd rather find ways o=</i><br>
f<br>
<i>&gt;*broadening* the appeal of extropian ideas to a wider range of personali=</i><br>
ty<br>
<i>&gt;types, rather than only seeking those who already think in similar ways.</i><br>
<p>
Robin Hanson:<br>
We have different goals here.  I want to find out what we have in<br>
common.  If it turns out that most of us (including me) aren't really<br>
attracted to one of your "extropian ideas", then I'm not interested in<br>
trying to broaden the appeal of that idea. =20<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
I think what needs to be ascertained here is from whence the term=20<br>
=93extropian=94 and its definition come.  If indeed it is an invention<br>
solely=20<br>
of Max=92s mind, I believe it remains such until he surrenders it=20<br>
voluntarily to a consensus definition.<br>
<p>
This is one of the problems of trying to create a movement based=20<br>
on spontaneous order.  The very nature of the members is to react=20<br>
against a centralized authority.  I think that Max understands this. =20<br>
It=92s a problem in the Libertarian Party as well, which, I think,=20<br>
is a party of anti-partyists and therefore ineffectual. =20<br>
<p>
My own reason for being here isn=92t because I=92m desparate to see=20<br>
everyone become an Extropian, or to see Extropians become like=20<br>
me.  It is because the ideas make perfect sense to me.  I think that=20<br>
Extropian memes, with the possible exception of DO, will make=20<br>
their ways throughout culture with or without help from ExI.<br>
<p>
I agree with most of Max=92s ideas, and I believe he puts forth=20<br>
every effort to be rational, open-minded and honest.  I don=92t think=20<br>
I can accept pan-critical rationalism, because it still seems vibrantly=20<br>
clear to me that existence exists axiomatically.  But this doesn=92t=20<br>
upset any of the rest of the Extropian Priniciples.<br>
<p>
Max More:<br>
<i>&gt;... Nor do I think technical understanding will distinguish=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;proto-extropians from others well, though it will often be a factor=20</i><br>
<i>&gt;that contributes to extropian sympathies.</i><br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
For what it=92s worth, I=92m relatively free of technical understanding=20<br>
of the scientific issues.  I spent the first quarter-century of my=20<br>
(eternal) life studying music.  Only in the last few years have=20<br>
scientific concerns been of any interest to me.  I still don=92t think=20<br>
they=92re absolutely necessary for understanding of and resonance=20<br>
with Extropianism.<br>
<p>
Max More:<br>
<i>&gt; EXTROPY -- A measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality,</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth.</i><br>
<p>
Lyle Burkhead:<br>
Measure?  in what units?  Does this definition really say anything? =20<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
True, this does imply some kind of calculable Extropy Average. =20<br>
Perhaps it=92s not so much a definition as a sales pitch for an attitude.=<br>
 =20<br>
I accept it as such.<br>
<p>
Lyle Burkhead:<br>
Consider the expression "The philosophy that seeks to... " =20<br>
<p>
Does this mean that your metaphysics, your ontology, your logic, your=20<br>
philosophy of mind, your ethics, and your aesthetics will be determined=20<br>
by the need to increase the eight quantities that must be increased? =20<br>
<p>
Marx said "The point is not to understand the world, but to change it." =20<br>
This puts the cart before the horse.  The correct procedure is as<br>
follows: =20<br>
First one uses philosophy to ascertain the nature of the world; *then*=20<br>
one decides what should or should not be done. =20<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
I think that you=92re being unfair here.  Over and over, Max states that=20<br>
Extropianism is dynamic, not dogmatic.  The Extropian philosophy is=20<br>
geared toward encouraging behavior and situations that tend to increase=20<br>
our knowledge of the world and minimizing those that hide it from us. =20<br>
Put another way, an Extropian admits that he is not all-knowing and=20<br>
all-powerful; he actively seeks to rectify that through increasing his=20<br>
own intelligence, information, energy, vitality, experience, diversity,=20<br>
opportunity, and growth.  I think that Extropianism succeeds when=20<br>
seen as a catalyst for the individual, and when it is promoted as such. =20<br>
When there is a push to create an Extropian Society (tm), I grow=20<br>
suspicious.<br>
<p>
Ben Goertzel:<br>
Extropianism is certainly an interesting philosophy, and I sympathize<br>
strongly with most aspects of it -- this is why I subscribed to<br>
the mailing list.<br>
<p>
But I don't get the conceptual connection of Libertarianism with<br>
futuristic technology, complexity theory &amp; spontaneous organization.<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
I'm not sure what the consensus opinion is toward Rand on the list,<br>
perhaps it's on the antagonistic side, but it is through reading=20<br>
_The Fountainhead_ and _Atlas Shrugged_ that I acquired a taste=20<br>
for SO and self-determination.  Once again, I see Extropianism=20<br>
as a tool for the individual, not as an erector of social=20<br>
structures.<br>
<p>
Ben Goertzel:<br>
After all, is the State itself not a "spontaneous organization? --<br>
a self-organized structure.  The State was not exactly set in place<br>
from the outside, now was it -- it EMERGED, just like thought patterns<br>
in a neural network, just like hexagonal rolls in a Benard cell,<br>
etc. etc.<br>
<p>
My belief is that while current government structures are in many ways<br>
too restrictive, libertarianism would ALSO lead to an overly restrictive<br>
system.  Free markets don't seem to stay "free" -- they seem to drift<br>
into attractors consisting of MONOPOLIES or OLIGOPOLIES.  Look at the<br>
software market, which is a free market, but is dominated by MicroSoft<br>
to everyone's detriment.  What is needed is some kind of<br>
"institutionalization<br>
of experimentation" -- some kind of overall structure to prevent the<br>
spontaneous emergence of repressive governmental and corporate<br>
structures.<br>
IN my opinion.  But this is a personal opinion which I do not claim to<br>
have derived from scientific principles, mind you...<br>
<p>
I think the question of the optimal social structure is an interesting<br>
one, which is probably explorable by computer simulations along the=20<br>
lines of the commercial SimCity program. =20<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
To my mind, this all smacks Plato=92s _Republic_.  The point is, I'm<br>
inclined<br>
to resist having anybody=92s social structure imposed on me, no matter ho=<br>
w=20<br>
well-studied it is.  And another thing: Microsoft is not a monopoly. =20<br>
Repeat.  Microsoft is not a monopoly.  I know, you didn=92t say explicitl=<br>
y<br>
that it was.  I just like to say that :)<br>
<p>
Given, saying that something arises from un-spontaneous order is like<br>
asserting that something in the universe is un-natural.  Perhaps we<br>
should<br>
look at Max=92s definition again, which goes beyond the literal meaning=20<br>
of the 2 words:<br>
<p>
Max More:<br>
5. Spontaneous Order  =97 Supporting decentralized, voluntaristic social<br>
coordination processes. Fostering tolerance, diversity, long-term<br>
thinking,<br>
personal responsibility, and individual liberty.<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
Once again, I think the aim here is to support the elimination of<br>
barriers=20<br>
to individual choice which arise from centralized, entrenched power=20<br>
structures.  An individual, if aware of his own worth, will resist these<br>
kinds of structures and will gravitate towards those which propose to<br>
let him retain his autonomy.<br>
<p>
Ben Goertzel:<br>
I don't think that it is wise<br>
to link one political persuasion (libertarianism) with hi technology<br>
and freedom, to the exclusion of others.  Hasn't complexity science<br>
taught us that things are not this simple??<br>
<p>
Kurt Rongey:<br>
I would say that freedom is in fact inextricably linked with political=20<br>
thought.  Liberty creates the choices from which we can be =93free=94=20<br>
to choose.  The more choices the more freedom.  The degree to=20<br>
which liberty is limited is the degree to which choices are limited=20<br>
is the degree to which the individual suffers.  The degree to which<br>
the choices of a researcher (vis a vis experimental techniques) is<br>
limited is the degree to which that research is suppressed.  Thus<br>
the limitation and hampering of technological progress.  If there<br>
is something in complexity theory that challenges these conclusions<br>
of mine, I'd be interested to hear them.  At present, I think a=20<br>
barrier is a barrier.<br>
