<i>&gt; Evolutionary psychology is the only way to develop any understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatsoever of this subject.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<p>
I think I sort of understand mammalian sex in nonhumans which<br>
means I have some clues about human sexuality.  Does anyone know of<br>
any particularly good books or papers on the evolutionary psychology<br>
of human sexuality?  I have read a few things about the evolution<br>
of human sex (a book or two).  I have seen very little that deals<br>
with the chemical effects of sexual stimulation on the human brain<br>
and how it influences our personality and perceptions.<br>
<p>
I do think in general terms I understand how and why people select<br>
mates etc., but most of what has been written deals with reproductive <br>
strategies.  That is fine and it explains a lot of human behavior,  <br>
however I am not very interested in reproduction.  How humans<br>
generally are and why they got that way is interesting and useful<br>
but I am primarily concerned with discovering ways we can be to yield <br>
the greatest benefits.<br>
<p>
There are two basic questions.  First, what sort of teaming up<br>
maximizes extropian type goals and how can sex be of benefit in<br>
such teaming?  Second, what sorts of behaviors yield greatest<br>
pleasure?  The answers are going to vary depending on individual<br>
biochemistry, history, temperament, and circumstance but I still<br>
may be able to come up with some general guidelines.<br>
<p>
I seems clear that some form of cohabitation is a good thing.<br>
It is good to have at least one person who has a general feel for<br>
your customary behavior and who has a sense of when something is awry.<br>
It is good if there is someone who really cares enough to make sure<br>
the doctors are doing a good job if you are too ill to look out<br>
for yourself, etc.  The cost to benefit ratio of such arrangements <br>
is pretty small (assuming you pick people of comparable fitness and<br>
resourcefulness).  I suppose there are probably better ways to<br>
gain such security (like building a good professional relationship<br>
with competent doctors and lawyers) but someone intelligent who<br>
loves you never hurts.<br>
<p>
Personalities and projects vary but it is often good for people<br>
to have someone to bounce ideas around with.  Exposure to varying<br>
ideas seems to help people towards greater sanity (assuming they<br>
don't get overloaded too fast).<br>
<p>
People have value to us, as sources of information, as trading<br>
partners, etc.  However given the large number of people available<br>
to each of us, most people are fairly replaceable.  It is often<br>
easier and quicker to find new people to hang around than to help<br>
some old friend past some hurdle.  However many of us will have<br>
times in our lives when the help we receive will be of more value<br>
than the cost of giving such help to another.  It is however often<br>
hard to feel that value even if we can see it logically.  The sexual<br>
(or pleasure, or friendship, or some other emotion) bond can help<br>
our bodies to understand what we know rationally.<br>
<p>
I know at some animal level parts of me place a high value on sex;<br>
if I decide I value a relationship with someone greatly, sex can<br>
allow me to feel that as well as think it.  There are other ways<br>
to do that but sex is I think the fastest (going through<br>
a life-threatening crisis together may work even faster but is...<br>
well, life-threatening; perhaps there are things that would<br>
simulate that to the body).<br>
<p>
Then again, maybe the rapid intimacy it produces is a drawback of<br>
sex.  It certainly is not desirable if one is having sex primarily<br>
for fun with people one has no desire to bond with.  I know many <br>
people make a point to fight such intimacy. So is it the chemistry <br>
of sex that produces the intimacy or does sex teach us a lot about <br>
a person's basic behavior which helps to develop intimacy and decide <br>
how to structure a relationship?<br>
<p>
I think it's fairly well accepted that having a lover is a win.<br>
I am wondering what configurations are optimal.  For a long<br>
time I have thought small groups with each member belonging<br>
to a few groups and people rotating in and out would be good.  That <br>
would be a base with people varying their pattern based on how they <br>
travel and what projects they are working on.  I get that it's not <br>
going to be such a rational decision and that there are biology and <br>
cultural norms to consider but I'm trying to start somewhere.  Can <br>
anyone think of sources other than Heinlein that consider such things <br>
in depth?<br>
<p>
I suppose given the fairly gentle environment we live in, if one<br>
sets up good professional relationships, couples with close friends<br>
and maybe a little shuffling around works about as well as anything.<br>
I suppose open relationships with small multiples of close relationships<br>
or triads also work.  I haven't seen many other relationship types. <br>
Is that an artifact of reproductive biology or are such arrangements <br>
particularly stable for other reasons?  Maybe anything else is excessive <br>
other than as a hobby.<br>
  <br>
Oh well, I'm just groping here so I'll let this simmer for a while<br>
and go think about what sort of car I want to be driving or something.<br>
Hopefully someone with more of a clue will post a few quick paragraphs<br>
to put the topic in perspective. <br>
