<i>&gt; intelligence can increase incredibly as we change our ways of thinking and </i><br>
<i>&gt; develop more useful knowledge.  The nature of the "hardware" of our brains is </i><br>
<i>&gt; very important too, but the right "software" can make the difference between a </i><br>
<i>&gt; bumbling moron and a brilliant genius.  </i><br>
I`m not sure if that`s the case, although I certainly hope so. For <br>
example, take raw mathematical skills. While mine are fairly good, I <br>
don`t have a hope of having the same insights into problems as , say <br>
Richard Feynman did. I could practice day and night, and while I would <br>
certainly become better, my hardware just isn`t as good as his was. &gt; <br>
<i>&gt; We all have the ability to increase our intelligence by a tremendous amount by </i><br>
<i>&gt; constantly developing and refining more powerful thinking skills and </i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge.  I have been doing this for the past few years, and I am several </i><br>
<i>&gt; times more intelligent than I was a few years ago, and my rate of progress </i><br>
<i>&gt; continues to accellerate.  It is because I am constantly revising and refining </i><br>
<i>&gt; my observational and thinking skills.  I am rewriting my own software, and I </i><br>
<i>&gt; am becoming smarter because of it.  It requires a great deal of personal </i><br>
<i>&gt; discipline, but we can make ourselves more intelligent by altering our ways of </i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking and our ways of gathering information.</i><br>
<p>
Really. Could give me some of the techniques you have been using. I would certainly appreciate any methods of <br>
making myself more intelligent.<br>
How do you alter your ways of taking in information? More diverse media?<br>
How do you improve your observational and thinking skills. I just wrote a <br>
programming competition today, and I watched as I was stumped on one <br>
problem, a couple of people were burning up the score rankings. What <br>
makes a person have insights? &gt; &gt; - David Musick &gt; <br>
