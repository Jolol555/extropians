IRA to IAN: I don't "claim" to enjoy battling clueless paranoids -- I can<br>
prove that I enjoy battling them. &lt;g&gt;<br>

Funny that you claim the mantle of "skeptical inquiry."  I remain skeptical<br>
about the Navy missile theory.  I don't think the issue is whether one of<br>
us is skeptical and the other is not, I think the issue is what each of us<br>
thinks is a proper target of skepticism.<br>
<p>
While the world is brimming with liars and thieves, I remain dynamically<br>
optimistic that the truth meme is very powerful.  In the days before<br>
electronic media, the truth sometimes took centuries to finally assert<br>
itself.  Now, thanks to technological progress, the truth can travel just<br>
as fast -- if not faster -- than falsehood.<br>
<p>
While you and others spread the Navy missile story over the Internet, the<br>
news media (for all its faults) spreads reports via broadband fiber and<br>
satellite links of Salinger holding crumbled papers that he refuses to let<br>
anyone examine.<br>
While Navy Admiral Edward Kristensen left the door open a crack -- properly<br>
so, as he making statements based on what his staff tells him -- it is now<br>
clear that Salinger is the intellectually dishonest scoundrel that (ahem) I<br>
suspected.<br>
<p>
But in fairness, you deserve credit for backing off on Salinger.  I don't<br>
mean that in anything but a positive sense.  Most "clueless paranoids" are<br>
unable to back off on anything, instead building a case that becomes<br>
increasingly convoluted over time.  (I know this from countless hours<br>
battling them.)<br>
