[OK, these are cheap philosophical tricks and I don't plan to follow up <br>
much on them]<br>

Well, you know that *someone*, or *something* is cogitating. <br>

Hmm, what about:<br>

my computer or one of those motorized toy cars that babies think are<br>

The problem of other minds (does anybody but me have consciousness, or do <br>
they just mimic it?) is IMHO unsolvable, and the minimalist solution <br>
(solipsism) tends to be rather pointless. One simply has to decide on an <br>
useful interpretation. As Malcolm McMahon wrote:<br>
<p>
	To treat something as conscious when it turns out not to be is a<br>
	little foolish.<br>
<p>
	To treat something as not consious when it turns out to be is an<br>
	ethical outrage.<br>
<p>
	So the time will come when we must give the benefit of the doubt.<br>
