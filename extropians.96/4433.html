Since when I was born, the city of Lowell, Massachusetts actually named<br>
a day after me, I would like to put this holiday to good use. Everyone<br>
always talks about how they wished the "holiday spirit" of goodwill<br>
toward men and so forth were all year long. If so, what we need is a<br>
year long holiday season!<br>
<p>
So as to do my part to extend the holiday season by 47 days (41 if your<br>
count New Years), as a sovreign Netizen, I have declared Feb 10th as<br>
Mikeymas(tm). <br>
<p>
"Attention Internet Shoppers, you now have 47 more days to do your<br>
holiday shopping"<br>
<p>
ANyone else have their own holidays?<br>
