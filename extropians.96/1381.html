There are a number of high pressure phases of water, including a few<br>
which are<br>
solid at room temperature. It is often suggested as an alternate means<br>
of cryonic<br>
suspension. When I was at the Alcor festival I spoke with someone who<br>
had worked<br>
with an apparatus capable of creating these. The project is currently<br>
inactive and<br>
quite a few important physical questions need study. For example, if a<br>
sample were<br>
compressed and then cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, would it<br>
remain metastable<br>
when the pressure was released. On warmup, would the expansion be abrupt<br>
(ie, is<br>
it really a bomb?).<br>
<p>
On a lighter side, I was on a boat in Alaska in a fjord and snagged some<br>
glacier ice.<br>
The trapped air fizzled when the ice melted (A lot like Hot Rocks from<br>
the convenience<br>
store, which is CO2 trapped in sugar). I read once of a business<br>
failure, which was to<br>
ship glacier ice to bars around the country as a novelty item.<br>
