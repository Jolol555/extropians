John Clark said he has chosen to feel sorrowful because it seems that I was <br>
personally offended by his response to my original 'God' post.  John, let me <br>
assure you that I did not choose to be offended by what you wrote, and I in no <br>
way chose to interpret it as a personal insult.  I don't think you intended it <br>
to be insulting to me, and even if you did, it would be silly for me to cause <br>
myself to be "offended" simply because you chose to be "insulting".<br>
<p>
What really happened is that I interpreted your response to my 'God' post as <br>
not really responding to what I had actually writtend and intended.  I figured <br>
that you saw the word, "God" and that triggered off all your typical arguments <br>
against the common, Christian myth of God.  I was puzzled why it wasn't clear <br>
to you that I was referring to a different concept under the same name, a <br>
concept which I described in my post.  One possible reason that occurred to me <br>
at the time is that you were dogmatically athiestic, that you were determined <br>
not to believe in any sort of conscious creator of universes no matter what <br>
and that your fervor for this caused you to mis-read what I had written or to <br>
purposely mis-interpret it.  Another possibility that occurred to me was that <br>
I wasn't clear enough in my post in my descriptions of the nature of this <br>
"God" I was conjecturing.  So, I wrote a second post, in which I attempted to <br>
address both possibilities.  I explained my "God" idea more clearly and <br>
inserted a few attacks on atheistic dogmatism and dogmatism in general.<br>
<p>
I think I went a bit heavy with my attacks on dogmatism, and I think that led <br>
to your interpretation that I was personaly offended by your post.  I view <br>
dogmatism about the same way as I view self-lobotomization, and I am a strong <br>
advocate of people advancing themselves beyond crippling, dogmatic ways of <br>
thinking; hence my traditional signature line, - question tradition -.<br>
<p>
I didn't know whether you were truly dogmatic in your thinking, nor did I care <br>
much at the time; I was just enjoying attacking dogmatism, just like you were <br>
enjoying attacking goddism.  We may have looked like we were attacking each <br>
other, but I think it was very jestful, like children pretending to fight.  I <br>
sometimes enjoy engaging in those kind of intellectual mock battles, and I <br>
never become offended by them, not *really*, although it may seem like I am <br>
offended to observers, but that is just a way of making the play fight more <br>
fun!<br>
<p>
As you observed, "God" is a worn-out, old word, with much extra baggage, and <br>
unfortunately, it is difficult to use that word without evoking all of the <br>
unintended meanings.  I like the word, "U-Prime", which I first saw Michael <br>
Lorrey use.  I use this word to refer to the hypothetical creator of <br>
universes, one of which we find ourselves inhabiting.  It says nothing about <br>
the powers of this entity, except for the ability to have created our universe <br>
and possibly others, nothing more.<br>
<p>
Also, you were wondering why U-Prime would use Darwinian evolution with all <br>
its eons of suffering, when Lamarkian style evolution is much more humane and <br>
rapid.  First, a U-Prime may not have much choice in the matter; perhaps it <br>
can only specify a few parameters, and let the universe run from there and <br>
only influence highly conscious and intelligent systems which develop in that <br>
universe, or maybe not even them.  It also may not be possible to create a <br>
universe with sufficient complexity, at the outset, to exhibit Lamarkian <br>
evolution.  Universes may have to evolve Darwinianly for a while before they <br>
become advanced enough to evolve by passing on acquired characteristics.  If <br>
one views the long, drawn-out suffering of conscious beings in Darwinian <br>
evolution as a necessary step to truly advanced evolution, then it does not <br>
seem so horrible to create universes which pass through this stage, to emerge <br>
as glorious entities, *far* more conscious and wonderful than the <br>
comparitively insignificant beings who had to suffer in order to allow the <br>
emergence of such a wonderful, gloriously conscious universe.  Beings such as <br>
ourselves may be considered hardly conscious at all, and our suffering may <br>
mean little to truly advanced beings, any more than we're likely to care about <br>
the suffering of bacterial cells, or considering that it counts as *real* <br>
suffering. (But watch out for the emerging BioActivists: after animal rights <br>
are established, plants and bacteria are next.  Use of one's immune system <br>
will be considered a crime, and washing one's hands even worse than that :-)<br>
<p>
Well, John, I enjoyed your fine post about the question, "Why is there <br>
something, rather than nothing?"  I've been pondering that question for a <br>
while now, and I was going to bring it up if no one else did.  Maybe it's a <br>
ridiculous question, if you really think about it, but then again, maybe not.  <br>
Although, a truly ridiculous question, which I enjoy asking often is, "Is <br>
there really anything?"  Of course there is; there is this experience right <br>
now.  But, "What is the nature of this experience right now?"  And this <br>
question is not so ridiculous, and it makes me wonder about a great many <br>
things.  It also encourages me to be more watchful of my current experiences, <br>
to understand what it's like to experience this moment right now.  It seems <br>
such a profound mystery that this moment of experience exists!  Rather than <br>
nothing.  Why?<br>
