Max More begins The Extropian Principles as follows:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; EXTROPY -- A measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality,</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth.</i><br>
<p>
Measure?  in what units?  Does this definition really say anything?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; EXTROPIANISM -- The philosophy that seeks to increase extropy.</i><br>
<p>
Assume you can measure all these things; why are we supposed to want <br>
to increase them?  I can understand increasing intelligence, vitality, and <br>
opportunity, but some of the others are problematic.  Why should we <br>
seek to increase experience per se, no matter what kind of experience <br>
it is?  Do you really want to increase diversity?  Does this mean you <br>
oppose the homogenization of cultures?  I suppose "energy" refers to <br>
energy available for use in the economy, and "growth" refers to <br>
economic growth.  Do you want to increase these, no matter what?  <br>
Why is this axiomatic?  <br>
<p>
Consider the expression "The philosophy that seeks to... "  <br>
<p>
Does this mean that your metaphysics, your ontology, your logic, your <br>
philosophy of mind, your ethics, and your aesthetics will be determined <br>
by the need to increase the eight quantities that must be increased?  <br>
<p>
Marx said "The point is not to understand the world, but to change it."  <br>
This puts the cart before the horse.  The correct procedure is as follows:  <br>
First one uses philosophy to ascertain the nature of the world; *then* <br>
one decides what should or should not be done.  <br>
