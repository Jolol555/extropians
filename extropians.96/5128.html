<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Successful cult memes induce behavior (typically focused attention)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;between cult members which trips the "improving status" detectors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Tripping the detectors causes the release of reward chemicals without</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Examples of focused attention are "love bombing" in the Moonies and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;"auditing" in Scientology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is the one idea with real content in Kieth's post.  But it needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to be fleshed out a lot more.  If focused attention makes us go gaga</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so, it is a puzzle why more other social institutions don't find some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; way to trip this detector more.  Why don't we see more analogues to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "love bombing" without all the other destructive behavior?</i><br>
<p>
Economics I suspect.  Focused attention costs because it involved at <br>
least the time of another person.  On the other hand, we *do* see a lot<br>
of low cost tries.  Telemarketing for one.  Ads which try to simulate<br>
attention.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I remember reading in one of the science journals about a study done</i><br>
<i>&gt; where subjects just stared into each others eyes for certain periods. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; turned out that the longer you locked eyes, the more likely you were to</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop feelings of attraction for the opposite person. Does this sound</i><br>
<i>&gt; like an analogue to the focused attention effect?</i><br>
<p>
Might be.  There is a lot to be learned in the way we primates react to<br>
each other.<br>

Excellent example.  In fact, the reason we do a lot of things, including<br>
posting to this mail list, is because of the status it gets us, which we<br>
can sense by the level of attention we get.  Not that I expect many of <br>
us will improve our reproductive success (or even get extra mating <br>
opportunties) by these activities, but none-the-less, that seems to be<br>
the origin of the motivations involved.  &lt;g&gt;  Keith Henson<br>
