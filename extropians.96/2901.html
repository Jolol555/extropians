     The goal of the Prometheus Project is the fully reversible suspended<br>
animation of humans. This revolutionary idea has been a topic of science<br>
fiction for decades and was briefly considered by NASA for long-range space<br>
travel in the early 70s. Until now, however, no one has seriously believed<br>
that it might be achievable within our lifetime.<br>
<p>
     The Project began within a small group of futurists on the Internet who<br>
were discussing recent developments in organ preservation. After over 20<br>
years of underfunded, painstaking effort, the accomplishment of fully<br>
reversible long-term cryopreservation of human organs is now within our<br>
reach. From this discussion grew the idea that whole-body suspended animation<br>
is now probably attainable within 20 years.<br>
<p>
     The Prometheus Project conditional pledge campaign was developed to<br>
gauge whether there is sufficient support to launch this revolutionary<br>
project. Because of its length and difficulty, the Project will be done in<br>
two parts.<br>
<p>
     The first part will show full recovery of the central nervous system. In<br>
essence, this will be a ten year feasibility study to decide if the Project's<br>
main goal, suspended animation, is achievable. This initial work is expected<br>
to require about $1 million per year to accomplish. Four months into the<br>
pledge campaign, over 30% of the required funds have already been pledged.<br>
<p>
     The second part of the Project will need considerably more funding. But<br>
with the convincing demonstration of the suspended animation of the central<br>
nervous system provided by the first part, it is expected that this larger<br>
amount will then be obtainable.<br>
<p>
     The Prometheus Project will be conducted by top scientists in the<br>
required disciplines under the aegis of a for-profit corporation which will<br>
be formed for this purpose when the pledge campaign has reached its funding<br>
goal. No money is due for share purchases until the required total has been<br>
pledged, and pledgers have approved the science and business plans for the<br>
Project.<br>
<p>
     If the Prometheus Project's goal of fully reversible suspended animation<br>
is successfully accomplished, it will have an enormous impact on the practice<br>
of medicine. Doctors will have the option of placing their terminal patients<br>
into suspended animation until future technology can cure what is killing<br>
them. Many people with incurable and terminal conditions will elect such a<br>
procedure with the reasonable expectation that advances in medical science<br>
will find cures for their conditions in the near future. They would then be<br>
revived and cured before rejoining their loved ones and continuing the life<br>
that would otherwise have been prematurely taken from them.<br>
