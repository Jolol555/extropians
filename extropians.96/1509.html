<p>
When you buy from a business, you directly help me, your fellow man, by<br>
paying my salary.   Is that greedy or selfish of me and my big-business<br>
employer?<br>
<p>
There is nothing more selfish or greedy than a government who spends probably<br>
100%+ of my tax dollars on interest payments (I call it the "blackhole").  <br>
<p>
That tax money goes to pay someone else's salary probably not even in the<br>
Western Hemisphere.  Because of this, the tax money doesn't really go for the<br>
things you think it does.  <br>
<p>
Besides, taxes increase business operating costs forcing my company to reduce<br>
my salary or lay me off.  When you pay your taxes you do not help me.  <br>
<p>
However, I do not expect to be helped by you or others for "free".  I don't<br>
want government charity either.   I think you and I must _both_ make a<br>
satisfying exchange (e.g.monitary) or I perfer NO deal at all.  If you don't<br>
think my business is worth buying from, you should not buy from me.<br>
