Yes, and I agree with what you went on to say about the importance of<br>
keeping your immediate goals in the context of your major long term goals.<br>
<p>
There seems to be an assumption in this discussion that believing in a God<br>
will make a person more successful and that we need to find rational ways of<br>
achieving the same effect. I think there are ways of achieving extreme<br>
focus, but I seriously doubt that believing in a God helps much. When the<br>
runner said "the first person I want to thank is God", she was simply<br>
interpreting her victory in terms of her religious beliefs. She didn't see<br>
how utterly absurd this was (why should God favor her?). The fact that she<br>
interpreted the result that way is not evidence that her belief helped her<br>
win. How would her belief help? If she believes her winning is inevitable<br>
because God is on her side, she might actually train less hard. Someone who<br>
believes it's up to them, and believes that they *can* win through maximum<br>
effort, seems to have a better chance (other things being equal).<br>
<p>
I don't doubt that there will some tasks that religious people will do<br>
better, like sacrificing their lives for a cause, but I don't envy them for<br>
that.<br>
<p>
Over the years I've collected quite a variety of techniques for boosting<br>
motivation and the winning mentality. I'll be explaining some of them in my<br>
Dynamic Optimism seminar in September. Eventually I'll have them in written<br>
form.<br>

Upward and Outward!<br>
