<i>                &gt;The computer is a tool designed to do deterministic </i><br>
<i>                &gt;computation.  If you are foolhardy enough  to try to do a </i><br>
<i>                &gt;non-deterministic computation on a computer, you do so at</i><br>
<i>                &gt;your own risk.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All algorithms are deterministic but not all algorithms are predictable. If<br>
it's foolhardy to write or run the above program there is no way to tell <br>
you're a fool in a finite amount of time. If it has not stopped at one <br>
trillion perhaps it will stop at a trillion and two. It may have been running <br>
for 10 billion years but that tells you nothing, 10 billion years is no closer <br>
to being an infinite amount of time than one second is. It could stop in the <br>
next 5 minutes, it might stop in another 99 trillion years, it might never<br>
stop. There is no way to tell.<br>
                                                                              <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;In fact, I would submit that computers are *consciously </i><br>
<i>                &gt;designed* in such a way as to be unable to solve </i><br>
<i>                &gt;non-deterministic problems </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well, it's not like computer designers had any choice in the matter, it's<br>
just the way things are. My program may well be able to solve its problem,<br>
the point is there is no way to know if it can or can not except to run it,<br>
and even then you can't even be sure. If it stops  then you know, but if it<br>
hasn't stopped yet, well maybe you just don't have enough patience.<br>
                      <br>
                                 <br>
<i>                &gt;I still maintain that we understand arithmetic computation.  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Not being able to solve a non-deterministic problem is by no </i><br>
<i>                &gt;means contrary to this.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why not?<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;&gt;John:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;How about trying to understand if a photon polarized at</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;90 degrees will pass through a polarizer set at 45 degrees?</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;Measure anything you want, look anywhere you want, compute</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;anything you want, and it's  still a crap shoot, the odds</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;are 50 50. According to Quantum Physics the reason we don't</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;understand some things is that there is nothing to</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;understand, no reason, no cause, it's truly random.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;James:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;This a measurement issue.  Its a crap shoot because we can't</i><br>
<i>                &gt;measure the exact state of the photon just prior to it</i><br>
<i>                &gt;entering the polarizer.  We can only measure the outcome.</i><br>
                                 <br>
<p>
Not so. I have a LASER that spits out photons at a random and unknown <br>
polarization. I spin my polarizer, at random it is set at 63 degrees. When <br>
the random photon hits my randomly set polarizer only 2 things can happen,<br>
the polarizer can stop the photon or it can let it pass through, the chances <br>
are exactly 50 50. If it passes through the polarizer I know the photon is<br>
polarized at 63 degrees. How do I Know this? because if set another polarizer<br>
at 63 degrees there is a 100% chance the photon will get through, it could <br>
pass through a thousand of them. On the other hand if I set just one  <br>
polarizer at  153 degrees (63 +90) there is a 0% chance the photon will get<br>
through. What about the intermediate case? If I set the polarizer at 108 <br>
degrees (63 +45) then the odds are 50 50 that the photon will get through<br>
and there is nothing you can do to improve your certainty.<br>
