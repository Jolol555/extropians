In response to de Vries:<br>
<p>
&lt;As I see it, immortalists can be divided into two groups: those who <br>
want to live on through there current minds and/or bodies, and those <br>
who don`t care how the "I" fits into the picture as long as the <br>
descendants are "better" than the current version of "I".&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't think we should be so *binary* in that judgment.  The extent to<br>
which we are willing to change or evolve is much more of a continuum<br>
or spectrum.  Partly because none of us can agree as to when we've<br>
passed beyond the threshold of humanity.  I am interested in changing<br>
and growing and evolving a great deal.  Yet I feel that I'm unwilling to give<br>
up some basics of my humanity.  That might be conservative to some, but<br>
radical to the majority.  I suppose it comes down to an individual judgment<br>
of what is really "I" at the core.  I'm willing to give up this body, for<br>
example, but not yet willing to give up the human form.  But I'd like it to be<br>
enhanced of course.  Where does that place me in the extropian values<br>
spectrum?  I guess I have similar reservations about my mind.  (Don't take<br>
that sentence out of context.)  I'd like it to be better informed, faster, even<br>
"sub-contracted" with daemon sub-routines, but all this in pursuit of my<br>
current identity, values, and goals structure.  I guess I have a serious<br>
Aesthetic Appreciation for some aspects of humanity and my own life. <br>
Presently, I would want that to continue forever.  I thought the very point<br>
of immortality was continuity of the self.  Continuity of life processes is<br>
just a variant of the life cycle.  I don't just want better descendants, I<br>
want a better self.  Maintaining a self absolutely requires some limits to<br>
how far you are willing to let yourself change, or evolve.  I think those<br>
limits are probably different for each of us.<br>
<p>
Hey, does anyone here think the boomers have the drive and selfishness<br>
to push for massive investment in age-delaying technology in their own<br>
lifetimes?  Or are they all going to go zen and "age with grace--die<br>
content."  Which do you prefer they do?<br>
