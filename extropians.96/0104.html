Eric says,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The only value systems that libertarianism opposes are the ones which</i><br>
<i>&gt;seek to impose themselves on unwilling participants by force.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Ok, ok, ok.  I guess these issues have been beat into the ground by<br>
other people in the past, already.  E.g., I would argue that I should<br>
be allowed to drop acid if I want to.  But someone else might say:<br>
No, that is an imposition on me, because the acid might make you go <br>
crazy and hurt me ... so your freedom to take acid acts against my<br>
freedom to walk around unmolested....  And you have to take into account<br>
all the different effects that each person's act has on everyone else.<br>
<p>
<p>
I think about this stuff all the time, living in Australia and paying<br>
the 42% national income tax here.  I miss the extra cash i would have<br>
if the taxes were closer to the US level.  On the other hand, I also<br>
like the low crime, national health care, and general absence of<br>
squalor in city streets which results from having a really thorough<br>
public sector (unlike the US social welfare system, which is half-assed<br>
however you look at it; it's lousy socialism and lousy capitalism).<br>
IN the US I had more "freedom" as to what to do with my dollars --<br>
on the other hand, because of everyone having this extra "freedom,"<br>
I lost other freedoms -- e.g. the freedom to walk ANYWHERE, anywhere I<br>
want, without fearing for my life.  I can do this in Australia, and the<br>
reason I can is that there are high taxes which support the poor, who<br>
thus do not try to "earn" their livings by stealing my money....<br>
<p>
<p>
There is an interesting psychology here too.  Humans will choose to <br>
pay a high tax rate, but would NEVER choose to donate a high percentage<br>
of their income to anything besides themselves.  Well, almost never.<br>
This is the same principle as the Christmas club or pension fund, <br>
I guess -- we make decisions IN ADVANCE which then constrain our<br>
of-the-moment impulses later on.  So we vote for high taxes and then<br>
grumble about them.  Funny organisms, we are, caught between<br>
intelligent large-scale planning and momentary gratification.<br>
<p>
Thing is, if we all download and live in some giant hard drive (or<br>
whatever technology comes next), issues of resource allocation will<br>
not go away.  We'll still have the same disputes of individualism<br>
versus collectivism -- of narrow (Libertarian-style) interpretations<br>
of freedom versus interpretations that take into account the whole<br>
web of social interactions. <br>
<p>
That is why it would be very nice to have a compassionate, intelligent<br>
scheme for allocating resources in place BEFORE we move into<br>
cyberspace.  Unfortunately this seems unlikely to occur!  Instead<br>
cyberspace will be colonized, most likely, by the capitalist "democracies"<br>
we all know and love.  Welcome to Microsoft (TM) Reality!!!<br>
