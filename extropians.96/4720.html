<i>&gt; From: David Musick </i><br>
<i>&gt; A techno-elite will arise in *any* scenario.  And I, for one, don't see </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything wrong with that</i><br>
<p>
I think that's either a defeatist, fatalistic or impassionate attitude to<br>
hold. And apart from that we have to make shure that there will not be a<br>
too small elite as it will stop the exponential growth.<br>
The world of knowledge as of now, is very disorganised with lots of<br>
redundancy. The amount of information in science is increasing<br>
exponentially also. Soon no one can hold the amount of information, The<br>
same experiments and calculations will be developed several times at once<br>
because no one can find any information. We have to develop ways to embedd<br>
knowledge in systems so the amount of disorganised information won't stop<br>
development. We have to develop applications that make use of all the<br>
information with an easy interface. This embedded knowledge will/must help<br>
others to become part of the development instead of wellfare cases.<br>
That way the info gap won't be to big and development will be speeded up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually, I am considering ways of inspiring the "masses" to become </i><br>
<i>&gt; techno-elites themselves.  </i><br>
<p>
Then we are just splitting semantics. If the masses become a techno elite,<br>
there will no longer be an elite. Of course there will allways be somebody<br>
with more talent than others. And that will automatically create an elite. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have nothing against "spreading the word".  I just think that *living*</i><br>
it is <br>
<i>&gt; profoundly more important.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
At this point in time i will say that they are just about equal. But i<br>
think we mostly agre here.<br>
