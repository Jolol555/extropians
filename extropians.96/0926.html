The following paper plausibly argues that global economic history is<br>
repeating a pattern of a century ago.  If so, this would imply<br>
increasing global political tensions.  Robin<br>

     The late 19th and the late 20th century shared more than<br>
     simply globalization and convergence. Globalization also<br>
     seems to have had the same impact on income distribution: in<br>
     the late 19th century, inequality rose in rich countries and<br>
     fell in poor countries; according to Adrian Wood, the same<br>
     has been true of the late 20th century. Furthermore, while<br>
     George Borjas and Wood think that globalization accounted for<br>
     something like a third to a half of the rise in inequality in<br>
     America and other OECD countries since the 1970s, the late<br>
     19th century evidence suggests at least the same, perhaps<br>
     more. However, those modern economists who favor a rising<br>
     inequality explanation coming from (unskilled) labor-saving<br>
     technological change will be pleased to hear that it probably<br>
     accounted for more than a third of the rising inequality in<br>
     the New World and for more than a half of the falling<br>
     inequality in Europe. It also appears that the inequality<br>
     trends which globalization produced prior to World War I<br>
     were at least partly responsible for the interwar retreat<br>
     from globalization. Will the world economy of the next<br>
     century also retreat from its commitment to globalization<br>
     because of its inequality side effects?<br>
