I agree with Mr. Brin that it would probably be best for everyone if we could <br>
all keep an eye on each other, so that we could especially watch those who <br>
have a great deal of power, so that we can be aware if they are planning to do <br>
anything dangerous to us, so that we can take action to stop them.  I sort of <br>
agree with his point that not having privacy is a good thing.  However, what I <br>
have not read from Mr. Brin is *how* we can realistically prevent people from <br>
having high levels of privacy, especially the powerful.  How can we stop <br>
people from using encryption?  The people who are conspiring against us are <br>
the ones who will most desire privacy and secrecy, but I don't see any <br>
realistic way of preventing them from attaining a sufficient level of secrecy <br>
to keep their conspiracy private.  Advanced encryption is profoundly difficult <br>
to even detect or crack.  How do we stop the powerful from developing and <br>
using such technologies?  How do we even know that they are using such <br>
technologies?  Sure, we can voluntarily refrain from keeping our own affairs <br>
private, but how can we ensure that *everyone* does this?  Mr. Brin, are you <br>
advocating *forcing* everyone to be public with every detail of their lives?  <br>
Or are you just hoping that everyone will see the sense you argue in not <br>
having too much privacy and willingly avoid being secretive?  What about those <br>
who have a real interest in keeping their affairs secret, such as the <br>
powerful?  What are you proposing to do about them?<br>
<p>
Mr. Brin, you preach the virtues of a society without privacy.  I would like <br>
to hear your plans for actually implementing this idea.  It's one thing to <br>
argue that your idea is a good idea, and it's quite another thing to actually <br>
have concrete plans to implement the idea.  I don't see how your idea can be <br>
implemented.  Do you?<br>
