David: It would really be helpful if you were to first read the original<br>
Extropian writing on dynamic optimism. I think it will answer most of your<br>
questions. Reading primary writings is generally expected on the Extropians<br>
list before asking people to explain an idea that's already been explained<br>
at length. Once you've read the essay, you'll be in a good position to pose<br>
further questions.<br>
<p>
The essay appeared in Extropy #8. It's not on ExI's web site yet (I'm<br>
considering whether to put on there a new version) but it's on my web site at:<br>
