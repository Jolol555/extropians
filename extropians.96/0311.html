I know him. He is a bit of Gadfly, but a well educated sort and a new<br>
media pundit. He thought Extropians had something to do with Lyndon<br>
LaRouche but I set him straight about that.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; that impression! I'd appreciate any information about Stahlman -- his views,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; his writings -- that could help me get a grip on his point of view.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Those who remember the DigitaLiberty mailing list will recall Stahlman. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember his writing to be flamboyant but generally incisive, consistently</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the side of individual freedom. Bill Frezza was the ostensible "owner</i><br>
<i>&gt; and operator" of the list, but I think Stahlman may have had co-status of</i><br>
<i>&gt; some sort. AFAIK, there are no public archives of that list, although I</i><br>
<i>&gt; and most likely others have private archives. The list went down a while</i><br>
<i>&gt; back, flared up briefly and then vanished again. Just like Duncan Frissell</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Sandy Sandfort's Privacy 101, all the good lists seem to just die out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (But Duncan and Sandy are still visibly active, at least, on cypherpunks;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't seen more than the occasional brief op-ed from Stahlman, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing from Frezza since (Information Week?) was carrying his column.</i><br>
