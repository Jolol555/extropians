Perhaps what we are after is a sensibility towards _refined emotions_.  <br>
<p>
Refined emotions are developed through exercising careful thinking.  Some<br>
tools to help achieve a level of _refined emotions_, at our current<br>
transhuman stage, are achieved by acquiring the ability to replay situations<br>
accurately, monitor information input, simulation of information, obtaining<br>
feedback from others and utilizing error-correctoring.  These are mental<br>
exercises.<br>
<p>
Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think of<br>
exercising the management of emotions.<br>
