From: Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;The Darwinian competition is going to turn rather vicious, and people</i><br>
<i>&gt;with frivolous goals may not survive.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with Lyle that this is going to happen eventually, not too<br>
long after there becomes a variety of highly effective things a lot of<br>
people can do to accelerate their own personal evolution.<br>
<p>
However, it doesn't seem to be a commonly held view; lots of people<br>
seem to believe that the technology will always create usable<br>
resources faster than the accelerated personal evolution will entice<br>
people to use them up, leaving each person with plenty of time for<br>
leisure and frivolous pursuits.<br>
<p>
This has immediate consequences.  If you think things will get<br>
competitive eventually, you can start learning how to compete now.<br>
Since we are a social animal, tying to be intelligently social is part<br>
of this.  <br>
<p>
If you think things will be loose and have lots of room for leisure<br>
for the indefinite future, you might as well go have fun now.  Since<br>
there is unlimited slack in your future, there's no need to preserve<br>
relationships with anybody; there will always be more people, and even<br>
if you gratituously offend everybody on hand, you'll still have<br>
unlimited slack, maybe just a little less.<br>
<p>
I think the stereotypical rude extropian has a wrong expectation about<br>
how much slack is available in the long term.  <br>
<p>
