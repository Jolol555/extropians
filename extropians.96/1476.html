Me:<br>
I think it may well be that a hybrid of the two has merit: "hunches" you <br>
can count on as the serial interface, with the ability to back-trace <br>
the "why"/"how" if you really want to. The best of both worlds, and <br>
rather akin to having interrogatable agents (I think of them as <br>
"deputies").<br>

Anders:<br>
I think we should try to find ways of communicating that are flexible <br>
enough to allow many different modes. I'm thinking of some kind of <br>
standardized mind-map with serial nodes linked by parallel/divergent <br>
arcs, which could automatically turn into hypertext, plaintext or other <br>
structures.<br>
<p>
Me:<br>
I have mixed feelings about this idea Judging from the number of <br>
people who rush to turn HTML into a page-description language rather <br>
than going for deep-structure (such as typed links), I get the weird <br>
impression that if you built it, they would come--but they'd do a lot <br>
of "wrong" stuff with it. :\ :)<br>
