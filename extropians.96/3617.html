All kinds of cool things can be done with refrigerators!  <br>
<p>

<p>
I agree with your last statement.  Proteins are always in motion.  <br>
They are like an elaborate construction of balls held together by springs, <br>
and the whole thing vibrates and pulsates at many levels.  Think of a <br>
bowl of jello, shaking:  that's what proteins look like.  <br>
<p>
When a protein embedded in a membrane encounters a certain <br>
molecule, it reacts -- it suddenly changes its mode of vibration, and   <br>
this change reverberates all over the membrane, causing further changes <br>
in the vibrations of all other proteins embedded in the membrane.  <br>
As a result of one molecule encountering one protein, pores may <br>
open or close all over the membrane, as other proteins react to the <br>
change in vibration of the sensor protein.  <br>
<p>
That's how membranes work.  At a very low temperature, such <br>
pulsations would not exist.  The atoms would be nearly motionless.  <br>
Therefore biological membranes require temperatures in a certain range.  <br>
Below that range, one would have to use other mechanisms to replace <br>
membranes. <br>
<p>
Below (far below?) that range, drexlerian nanotech becomes possible.  <br>
The fact that atoms are nearly motionless, as far as random vibrations <br>
are concerned, means that the atoms can move in slower, more regular, <br>
more "mechanical" motions, which they could not do at higher <br>
temperatures.  <br>
<p>
What I want to do is imbed drexlerian nanotech within biological <br>
nanotech.  Machines within cells.  To do that, first one must create a <br>
region in the cell cold enough for machines to exist.  <br>
<p>
To imbed machines in cells, we are going to have to recapitulate the <br>
steps our ancestors took when they embedded machinery in the natural <br>
(macroscopic) world.  They lived, at one time, among trees, flowers, <br>
animals, rocks -- nothing was artificial.  Somebody had to make the first <br>
sharpened rock.   Somebody had to make the first ruler -- a piece of <br>
wood with a straight line on one side.  (This was the first straight line <br>
that ever existed on this planet, or in the universe as far as we know.) <br>
Then they used their first crude tools to make better ones.  Eventually <br>
they reached the point where they could cast metals into pre-conceived <br>
shapes.  Centuries later, they reached a level of precision that allowed <br>
them to make clocks and engines.  This whole process began with a <br>
crude workshop in a forest -- a bench, a hammer, a flint knife, and a <br>
man with imagination.  <br>
<p>
We are going to have to do similar things on the nano level.  We are <br>
given a cell full of proteins, membranes, microtubules, and so forth;  <br>
this corresponds to the rocks and trees our ancestors used when they <br>
first started making tools.  What corresponds to the first sharpened <br>
rock?  What corresponds to the first ruler?  <br>
