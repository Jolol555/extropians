<i>&gt;Seen any nano recently? Noticed some megaengineering? I shouldn't be</i><br>
<i>&gt;sarcastic, but we are very far from the judeo-christian god.</i><br>
<p>
Thats ok. Be as sarcastic as you like. I _rarely_ take things personally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And yes, you would need super-AI to create life with nano, either as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;part of yourself or as your designer. It is not trivial at all (just look </i><br>
<i>&gt;at any book on cell biology). Creating good artificial life in virtual </i><br>
<i>&gt;reality is hard enough. </i><br>
<p>
You don't think we will build tools powerful enough or find shortcuts<br>
around needing an SI to do the tasks such as smart tools like windows95<br>
'wizards' where the designer would just design the properties of the<br>
animal/plant they liked and the 'wizard' would fill in the blanks er organs<br>
to make the animal work. You need not render the entire animal just like<br>
with a virtual human you would need only to entirely process the brain but<br>
you can take shortcuts with the body due to the lack of need for internal<br>
organs. It's the same thing as rendering computer graphics in realtime with<br>
polygons instead of the time and processing intensive task of rendering the<br>
computer graphics pixel by pixel with complex algorithms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;These personalities does not work in parallel, instead they seem to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;different metastable "attractors" of the brain. The person shifts between </i><br>
<i>&gt;them (and they can be extremely different - there are even differences in </i><br>
<i>&gt;their sensory evolked potentials!), but when a personality isn't "used" </i><br>
<i>&gt;it doesn't exist.</i><br>
<p>
I watched a show on TV recently in which the girl referred to herself as<br>
'we' all the time and called her four remaining personalities the 'troops'.<br>
She could recieve messages from all four personalities at once or so it<br>
seemed. Can any cases of MP disorder share data between personalities? I've<br>
also heard about personalities writing to other personalities by writing<br>
letters to each other. Is there more than one form of this disorder?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But we have plenty of other multitask power in our </i><br>
<i>&gt;unconscious mind.</i><br>
<p>
Well this solves our problem as to where multitasking power can come from<br>
for background creative tasks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I was talking about running them. Let's say I want to create a cellular</i><br>
<i>&gt;automaton universe (the Autoverse) with roughly the same internal size and</i><br>
<i>&gt;complexity as the solar system. Assume we use clever compression so we</i><br>
<i>&gt;only have to deal with the places where matter exists, then we have around</i><br>
<i>&gt;10^31 kg of virtual matter, containing around 10^23 "atoms" each - 10^54</i><br>
<i>&gt;bits for the whole simulation. This simulation will not run in a computer </i><br>
<i>&gt;smaller than a star unless we can find some very clever optimizations...</i><br>
<p>
Do we really need to animate all the atoms which don't currently serve any<br>
practical use? We can simply suspend all atoms except for the ones which<br>
we're using and as the virtual cities grow and size and complexity of the<br>
universe grows, so will the processing power.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No, you will at best become something close to a greek god - powerful,</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledgeable, immortal and able to change yourself and the world. But you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are still not the least bit transcendent, omniscient, omnipotent or</i><br>
<i>&gt;omnipresent. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The sum of human knowledge sounds nice. But I want more. </i><br>
<p>
I completely agree! More is better but do we even know what more is yet?<br>
You're looking for quantity which is 'more' but we don't even know what<br>
awesome technologies are going to flow out of that great expanse of 'more'.<br>
I want quality as well as quantity and currently I'm focusing on quality so<br>
being a greek god will do me just fine until I'm there and can see better<br>
stuff coming down the tube. MUHAHAHAHA CREATE AND DESTROY AI CIVILIZATIONS<br>
AT MY WHIM! (please excuse the short power trip) The whole concept of<br>
uploading reminds me of Aladdin where Jafar becomes the genie (ie. The<br>
universe is mine to command! to control!) Just hope humans left behind<br>
don't destroy our magic lamp!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But you could of course simply halt them until the necessary technology </i><br>
<i>&gt;arrives. Instant (forward) timetravel. </i><br>
<p>
You could make the years of waiting appear to you as seconds as well as you<br>
wouldn't realize internet lag or slow updating of the virtual world because<br>
from your vantage point it would appear normal due to your mind slowing<br>
down with the virtual world.<br>
