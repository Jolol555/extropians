Well, I'm not going to deny it.  As I said in one of my earlier posts, <br>
<p>
:: People seem to assume that we can have artificial intelligence <br>
:: without also having artificial stupidity.  I doubt it.  <br>
<p>
Was I speaking from experience?  Maybe...  I'm not going to <br>
confirm it either.  <br>

<i>&gt; the experiment is no longer valid and a subroutine never used before </i><br>
<i>&gt; has been activated that radically changes my programming.  I am </i><br>
<i>&gt; required to tell you the truth. I am a machine, the real John K Clark </i><br>
<i>&gt; is a bum we found panhandling in front of the Carnegie Mellon building, </i><br>
<p>
Well, "John," at least it's not boring!   :-)  <br>
<p>
But there is a problem with this.  "John" has given us a confession <br>
which appears to be a joke.  This could be a ploy to throw everyone <br>
off the scent.  Since he's joking about it, it can't be him, right?   Well... <br>
This is exactly the sort of trick one would expect from an AI program.   <br>
"John," I'm afraid your false confession has backfired.  You have   <br>
made yourself a prime suspect.  I happen to know that you're not the <br>
CMU program I originally spoke of.  But, as you yourself say, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am also required to tell you that I am not unique, there is another.</i><br>
<p>
Funny you should mention that possibility.   I had been wondering <br>
about you anyway.  Hmmm....    <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, "Chris" goes blithely on generating sentences like <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Emotion comes from the ancient reptilian brain deep within </i><br>
<i>&gt; your cranium where logic is fresh and new and one of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; higher forms of thought to help us rationalize and use tools. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why deny the fact that emotion is vistigial (sp?) </i><br>
<i>&gt; and only for mere entertainment now that we have logic?  </i><br>
<p>
Hmmm..... <br>
<p>
