None of the "proofs" of The Bekenstein Bound that I know of have held up very <br>
well under close scrutiny, in spite of this I still think it's probably true, <br>
and my opinion plus 50 cents will buy you a cup of coffee. Tipler never <br>
claimed to have proven it, he just stated reason for thinking it might be <br>
true. If The Bekenstein Bound is true then it would certainly ace Tipler's<br>
argument that a copy of me accurate down to the smallest quantum level would <br>
indeed be me, but that's overkill. Tipler has said, and I agree completely, <br>
that his Omega Point Theory does not rise or fall on the validity of The <br>
Bekenstein Bound. A less than perfect copy of me would still be me, I'm the <br>
same man I was a half a second ago. I think. <br>
           <br>
For me the key unknowns in the Omega Point Theory are, will there be a <br>
Big Crunch, and if so, can the universe make an infinite (and not just <br>
astronomical) number of calculations between now and then?<br>
              <br>
