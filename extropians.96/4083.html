Seconded. Human psychophysiology varies so much that it is not a good idea<br>
to generalize from a single case. E.S.Y. has discovered that Prozac is evil<br>
*for E.S.Y.*. That's good. He's learned something about his own body which<br>
should possibly be inscribed in NINE FOOT HIGH LETTERS OF FLAMING GASOLINE<br>
- in his own backyard.<br>
<p>
Paxil is another useful selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; some people<br>
I know have had good effects from it. Another way of raising effective<br>
serotonin levels is by taking more precursors to serotonin such as<br>
5-hydroxy-tryptophan.<br>
John Morgenthaler's Life Enhancement Products (1-800-543-3973 for further<br>
info) sells it in a tasty drink mix. It has pleasant effects. YMMV. (5-HTP<br>
is legal to sell, though tryptophan is not.)<br>
