&lt;It appears that you want only Powers ascribed to Omega, anything less,<br>
any intermediate level (like Jupiter-size brains or gallactic minds) is<br>
"just ridiculous, wildly impossible"!!??&gt;<br>
<p>
	One hundred percent absolutely correct! The Powers will think faster<br>
than we are, be smarter. How in the world do you imagine that they'll<br>
get to an "intermediate level" and just *stop* there? The essence of the<br>
Singularity is that a smarter being has an increased capacity to invent<br>
still smarter beings; that's why everything goes to infinity.<br>
<p>
&lt;Even with the unlimited memory you imply for your Powers (BTW, what<br>
would be the point of having more than one of these all-knowing<br>
beings?), even if they are able to immediately view anything they ever<br>
knew, why should they remember anything that we know now? WE were once<br>
embryos and (most) remember nothing from that time.  A galactic brain,<br>
for example, is no more going to 'remember' a single planet than we<br>
'remember' a single cell in our bodies.&gt;<br>
<p>
	When you see a bear, you don't suddenly conceive of "the bear". You see<br>
a picture of the bear complete with millions of pixels, every one of<br>
which you consciously perceive all at once. I doubt the Powers will<br>
settle for less; why should they?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Our sole responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are;<br>
any problems beyond that are not ours to solve.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;Rather Deathist I'd say - counting on the children to carry on for<br>
you.  It seems like you're saying that, since *you* can't possibly see<br>
*all* then there's no sense in trying to fathom anything.&gt;<br>
<p>
No - I'm saying that since *no mortal* can imagine someone smarter - not<br>
more intelligent, but smarter - there's no sense in trying to fathom the<br>
Singularity.<br>
<p>
I'm saying that problems which can occur only when transhumans are<br>
already around should be left to transhumans. There's no reason for<br>
mortals to think about those problems or try to solve them with our<br>
inadequate brains, especially when they'll all have such simple and<br>
obvious solutions to the Powers.<br>
<p>
Nor is it the children who will carry on: I said "The Powers, our future<br>
selves." But you're right - in a sense it is Deathist, in the sense that<br>
there is a Great Boundary which we need not think beyond. For some, the<br>
boundary is Death - for me, Singularity.<br>
