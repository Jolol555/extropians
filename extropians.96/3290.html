Abstract<br>
       Nicotine has been found to improve memory performance in a variety of tests, including the<br>
       radial-arm maze. This improvement, together with the consistent finding of a decline in<br>
       cortical nicotinic receptor concentration in Alzheimer's patients, has fueled the search for<br>
       novel nicotinic ligands with therapeutic potential. In the current studies, a series of<br>
       nicotinic compounds was tested for effects on working memory performance in the<br>
       radial-arm maze. One of the three compounds tested, DMAE II (dimethylaminoethanol<br>
       cyclohexyl carboxylate fumurate), produced significant improvements in working memory<br>
       performance. In the first experiment, this drug produced a biphasic dose-response curve<br>
       with improved performance at the 20-mg/kg dose but not at 10 or 40 mg/kg. In a second<br>
       round of DMAE II administration, the same rats showed a significant improvement with the<br>
       40-mg/kg dose. In the second experiment, a new set of rats also showed a biphasic<br>
       dose-response to DMAE II. The 20-mg/kg dose caused a significant improvement whereas<br>
       the 40-mg/kg dose did not. Interactions of DMAE II with nicotine and mecamylamine were<br>
       also studied. Nicotine (0.2 mg/kg) by itself caused a significant improvement in working<br>
       memory performance. No additive effects of DMAE II with nicotine were seen. In fact, some<br>
       attenuation of response was seen with the combination. Choice accuracy data for<br>
       mecamylamine could not be analyzed because of excessive sedation and nonresponding.<br>
       These studies show that, like nicotine, the nicotinic ligand DMAE II causes an improvement<br>
       in radial-arm mace choice accuracy. The lack of additivity with nicotine may have been to<br>
       the partial agonist effects of DMAE II. <br>
