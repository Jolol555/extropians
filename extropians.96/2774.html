Facts are only tedious if one keeps putting them together the same way!<br>
Facts can never be boring simply because there is absolutlely no end to<br>
them or the ways they can be arranged. Being extremely concise doesn't make<br>
communication unpleasant, only a rigidity of vision can do that.<br>
<p>
Enlightenment may come when assumption is sleeping. If one really wants to<br>
"see" something, put it in a utterly alien context - it's not the thing we<br>
see, but it's juxtapostion or contrast. Every good painter knows that the<br>
stars only come out at night because the sky is dark.<br>
<p>
A careless arrangement of facts produces and incorrect assumption, while a<br>
thoughtful arrangemnent may be highly functional and may even be close to<br>
"the knowing the truth."<br>

Only the boring know boredom<br>
