<i>&gt;My ancestors acted like "Native American" socialists, I guess.  They acted</i><br>
communally and hunted for the group, finally settling down and farming for<br>
the group.  Not exactly (;-) capitalists.  They took land by force all the<br>
time (right up to the middle 1970's).  Some of them now days are capitalists<br>
and some are still socialists.<br>

You can put me in the class of capitalist. My ancestors too. Chinooks were<br>
formidable traders and were known for their business skills, especially the<br>
women. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The socialists "feel sorry" for me because I do not accept government</i><br>
entitlements.  It's a long story but I am not exactly (;-) attracting them as<br>
friends these days.  They want me to "fight" for more government money.<br>
<p>
Sounds like the art complex I live in ; - ) I agree, nonprofit is not as good<br>
as for profit, nohow, noway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The capitalists among us (who I am and others who I admire)  are starting</i><br>
businesses and supporting ourselves.  We don't like what they see as<br>
government "hand-outs".  <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I agree 100% - The government is not giving self ownership and self<br>
empowerment. <br>
