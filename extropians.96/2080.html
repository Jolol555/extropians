<p>
When you say _all_ our sensory input, if you're talking about all the<br>
nerve signals in your body and all the endocrine signals and so on,<br>
you're talking a huge amount of data.  Of course, most of that wouldn't<br>
be very interesting, and most of it never gets to the brain, let alone<br>
long-term memory.  Data reduction is non-trivial and emotions (or at<br>
least the brain's limbic system) seem to play a big role in deciding<br>
what is important enough to go into long-term memory.<br>
<p>
&lt;Also, would it be possible to go back into the brain and retrieve all<br>
our old memories in sequence and then be able to play them back and<br>
reexperience them?&gt;<br>
<p>
Brain surgeons have been able to bring up all sorts of old memories in<br>
people under local anaesthesia when stimulating various parts of their<br>
(cut-open) brains.  Those having the surgery say it's just like<br>
reexperiencing the event.  However, I doubt very much if it's possible<br>
to retrieve memories _in sequence_.  Our memories seem to be stored in<br>
something more like a hypertext web than a sequencial database.  I think<br>
we'll have to wait for digitized uploads before we could play back and<br>
rexperience events of our lives in any kind of controlled manner.<br>
However, there are alot of yoga and other types of disciplines that have<br>
the goal of reexperiencing one's life in meditation in order to flush<br>
out any karmic kinks; BUT, the key word there is *discipline* - it takes<br>
alot of training and dedication (and I'm not sure, even then, if some of<br>
the memories aren't being fabricated on the fly).<br>
<p>
&lt;possibility of being able to communicate realtime feelings or stored<br>
memories direct to another<br>
individual with a brain-computer-brain interface?&gt;<br>
<p>
Communicating real-time feelings, at least in some generic sense, is<br>
probably already feasible. When I say 'generic', I mean that you could<br>
feel if I was happy, sad, etc.  Now, if I'm happy because the realtime<br>
experience has reminded me of some happy memory from my childhood, I<br>
doubt if it would be feasible to communicate that to you, at least not<br>
in realtime - there's just too many convoluted, reentrant mappings<br>
between concepts in our brains to do this in realtime, if at all.<br>
<p>
BTW, the latest _Mondo 2000_ is full of articles on this type of stuff<br>
(I just picked it up yesterday).<br>
