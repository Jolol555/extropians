No, not at all...<br>

 I suppose that if crack is cheap so the people<br>

<i>&gt; that every spirit broken by abuse (with all the attendant psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt; and drug-related problems) is a victory for entropy.  It also seems to me</i><br>
<i>&gt; that looking for ways to heal those spirits so people can stand on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own two feet (as it were) instead of using drugs as a crutch is a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; constructive endeavor for Extropians than circling the wagons or running</i><br>
<i>&gt; people down for behaving weakly or foolishly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Considering that I've been involved in actively working to get a number<br>
of freinds and colleagues in Seattle sober, I would be the last person<br>
to say to hell with them. But also because of my experience, I can tell<br>
you that substance abuse is merely a symptom of other problems,<br>
typically having to do with childhood trauma.<br>
