<i>&gt; While I appreciate your insistence on real scientific analysis, i think</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are giving to much of a benefit of the doubt to the establishment.</i><br>
<p>
If I sound like a lackey of the AMA, allow me to correct that.  I have<br>
no love for them, or the FDA, or any other forced monopoly.  I simply<br>
wish to debunk the "The establishment supresses cheap cures" meme that<br>
charlatans employ to justify their snake oil.  The standards of science<br>
and of any rational thought do not allow "taking sides".  I'm not on<br>
the side of convention or the side of alternatives--I am a rational<br>
mind, and I respect only the facts.  Both sides are guilty of many<br>
crimes against truth, but if I did have to pick which is more guilty,<br>
it would be the alternative crackpots.  They offer ancedote after<br>
anecdote--just as you did in the message I'm replying to--without even<br>
a trace of scientific integrity or restraint, and then gladly sell the<br>
unproven treatments to the uneducated masses, consequences be damned.<br>
<p>
I am amazed that some seemingly rational minds are even persuaded by<br>
something as thoroughly disproven as colloidial silver.  If it really<br>
worked--if one single responsible peer-reviewed study proved that it<br>
did something useful--it would be all over every paper in the nation,<br>
and any doctor would be crazy not to take advantage of it.  HMOs would<br>
dump the expensive stuff from their formularies in a minute if it was<br>
cheaper and as effective.  But the plain facts are that it's a fraud.<br>
<p>
Spare me the personal story, I'm not interested.  Show me proof.<br>
