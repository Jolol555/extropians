<i>&gt;&gt; A techno-elite will arise in *any* scenario.  And I, for one, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; don't see anything wrong with that</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think that's either a defeatist, fatalistic or impassionate attitude</i><br>
<i>&gt; to hold. And apart from that we have to make shure that there will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a too small elite as it will stop the exponential growth.</i><br>
<p>
Terms like "fatalistic" apply only to those who put constraints on<br>
the exercise of free will, not to those who simply recognize that<br>
inherent differences in capability exist--and should.  The two forces<br>
that drive evolution are diversity and selection--if one does away<br>
with either, then progress will stop.  A capitalist society grants<br>
only one kind of equality--rights.  The richest industrialists and<br>
the most wretched pauper have the same rights to life, liberty,<br>
and property; and the same moral means of exercising those rights--<br>
free and honest trade.  Any attempt to "equalize" the products of<br>
that trade--wealth, education, power--is doomed to infringe upon<br>
those fundamental rights, and destroy the rational, moral foundation<br>
of a free society, and destoys the diversity needed for it to grow.<br>
<p>
Rationally moral transhumans will help the masses transform precisely<br>
because they will be more valuable and profitable that way.  How many<br>
blacksmith shops are there today?  Not many, because the technology<br>
advanced to the point where they weren't needed, and the "elite"<br>
naturally formed companies to produce new products, trained workers<br>
to make them, invested in more research, educated their children, and<br>
did all the other things that follow from being a rational capitalist.<br>
This is the "selection" part of evolution--old things are put aside,<br>
and the winners rise to the top, until a new thing comes along.<br>
<p>
We must resist the temptation to "control" the evolution of society<br>
or of ourselves, but rely on the spontaneous order and feedback<br>
systems that will be most effective. <br>
