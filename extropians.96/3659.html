"Better" is an observer-dependent metric. Being human encompasses a lot <br>
of traits, not all of them positive. You should list some of them up, <br>
then checking whether all extropians would agree. <br>
<p>
There is a danger in trying to press a heterogenous (an understatement) <br>
bunch of people under the outward spiraling banner of Extropy. Extropy is <br>
a tool, not a religion. There is a tendency here to use labeling as threat <br>
of exclusion:  "You are not Extropian. You do not belong to us. You have to <br>
think thus &amp; thus to call yourself Extropian".<br>
<p>
(Don't get me wrong, this is not an attempt to introduce <br>
 overpermissiveness: "anything goes" goes exactly nowhere. A movement not <br>
 recognizable as such is not a beakon, it draws zero followers. I just <br>
 say be wary of your argumentation stratagems. <br>
