	There is a meme going around now that has infected huge numbers of people.  <br>
The meme is completely irrational, and it is a meme which blocks many <br>
Extropian and Transhuman memes.  The basic core of the meme is: "natural <br>
things are superior to artificial things."  It is quite common for an <br>
advertisement to claim that it's product's greatest advantage is that it is <br>
100% natural.  Not that it necessarily works better than artificial products, <br>
but that its naturalness somehow makes it a better product.<br>
	There are several ways of rationally approaching and destroying this meme.  <br>
The first is very direct:  the realization that EVERYTHING is natural, <br>
including humans and their technology.  This rips out the basic heart of the <br>
meme which is that there is a distinction between humans and nature.  However, <br>
that idea is very ingrained in our culture; the idea that humans are <br>
super-natural; that we and our technology are somehow not part of the process <br>
of nature.  So, more subversive disinfectants should be used as well.<br>
	These methods involve granting (temporarily) that the basic premise is true; <br>
that humans are in fact different from nature and thus so is our technology.  <br>
Then you bring up lots of things that are 100% natural, but are seen as very <br>
bad, like malarya and other horrible diseases.  Starving to death in horrible <br>
agony is perfectly natural; it happens all the time in the wild, along with <br>
horribly painful injuries and death.  A high infant mortality rate is 100% <br>
natural!  Poisonous gasses being emmitted in the atmosphere and wiping out <br>
nearly all living species is a perfectly natural type of event; it happened <br>
when certain types of life started producing that horrible poison, oxygen as a <br>
waste product.  These things are brought up to show that just because <br>
something's natural, that doesn't mean that it's pleasant or desireable, and <br>
in fact, most often it isn't.  Most things that are 100% natural are actually <br>
quite dangerous to humans.<br>
	It's funny to see food products in the supermarket that advertise themselves <br>
as being 100% natural, because I always think to myself, "Dog shit is 100% <br>
natural too, but I'm not gonna eat it!"  Poisonous mushrooms are also 100% <br>
natural, and since they're all-natural, they must be okay to eat, right?  And <br>
of course, we don't want any artificial preservatives in our food; botulism <br>
(food poisoning) is much better, because at least it's natural to have food go <br>
bad and be overrun by all kinds of poisonous bacteria.<br>
	And then there's the advertisements for medicines which claim to be 100% <br>
natural.  Yeah, right!  Like those pills grew on trees!  But the raw <br>
ingredients came from the natural world, one might argue, so even though it's <br>
processed beyond all recognition of what it originally was, it's still <br>
natural.  A little thinking would show that ALL medicines are 100% natural by <br>
that logic, since all the chemicals originally came from the natural world.  <br>
And again, a lot of things that are 100% natural can kill you, and so can a <br>
lot of  synthetic things, so the real criteria for a medicine is how well it <br>
actually works; whether it's natural or artificial is irrelevant (and this is <br>
the basic core of the counter-meme; that all things must be evaluated by their <br>
*actual properties*; their source is irrelevant).  Just because a plant made <br>
the chemical, that doesn't necessarily make it more effective than a chemical <br>
that a human makes.  It's a matter for scientific investigation to decide.  <br>
Nature's pharmacy is mostly poison.<br>
	Well, these are just some of the vaccemes to help wipe out the irrational <br>
meme that "Natural is better."  The basic idea is to make statements or ask <br>
questions that reveal the blatant ludicrousness of the meme that says, "Nature <br>
is better."  This type of thinking prevents people from accepting many of the <br>
life-improving technologies that Extropians generally endorse.  Any type of <br>
bio-enhancements are looked at as tampering with nature.  Of course, the <br>
mindless mutations caused by cosmic rays are 100% natural, so they're okay.  <br>
No, they're more than okay, they're better than the genetic engineers could <br>
ever do, even if they made the exact same mutations, because they're 100% <br>
NATURAL.<br>

All the electrons used to transmit this message are 100% natural and <br>
completely recyclable.  Just doing my part to help the environment.  Have a <br>
nice, 100% natural day!<br>
