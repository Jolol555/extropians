Ah, memory.... I once invented something very similar. Imagine a<br>
cardioid with its cusp on the Y axis, much like the usual drawing of a<br>
heart. At the tip of the cusp place an axle with a hole in it through<br>
which a shaft is placed. As the axle rotates, the shaft slides through<br>
the axle guided by the cardioid. (The width of the cardioid is constant<br>
regardless of the shaft angle.) The center of mass of the shaft<br>
describes a circle, and as it rotates at a constant speed (as driven by<br>
the shaft), the net result appears to be a centrifugal force pointing<br>
downward.<br>
<p>
I actually tried to build a physical model, but my limited ability with<br>
metalwork (a teenager with hand tools) kept me from making one which<br>
would actually turn. Years later I realised that all that would really<br>
happen is that the device would jiggle a bit around the center of the<br>
circle described by the shaft's center of mass, with no net momentum<br>
transfer outside of the system....<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Imagine a centrifugal drum, like that seen edge on in the animation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; below. If you had several masses in the drum, rotating around the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; geometric center, they would all produce equal centrifugal force at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; every point in their orbits, so you would essentially have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; workings of a gyroscope. However, if you were able to speed each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mass up at one point in the orbit, and slow it down again on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; opposite side of the centrifuge, you would have a point in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; centrifuge where all masses were going slowly on that side, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fast on the opposite side. This would produce excess centrifugal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; force in a direction straight out from the point of highest velocity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you would also impose a large amount of torque on the drum and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chassis of the device.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Take a mass M, weighing one gram.  M goes around in the centrifuge</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown.  At D, M travels at 5 meters/second, at B, 10 meters/second.  At</i><br>
<i>&gt; A, M is pushed forward by an extra 5 m/s and at C, M is slowed by 5 m/s.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The total system, including the centrifuge, works like this.  Start at A</i><br>
<i>&gt; before M is accelerated, assuming the whole device to have zero</i><br>
<i>&gt; momentum.  At A, M is pushed forward by 5 m/s.  This transfers</i><br>
<i>&gt; -5gm/s of momentum to the centrifuge.  M goes around the centrifuge</i><br>
<i>&gt; through B, coming out at C going -10 m/s instead of 10, transferring 20</i><br>
<i>&gt; gm/s of momentum to the centrifuge.  M is then slowed down at C,</i><br>
<i>&gt; transferring another -5gm/s to the centrifuge.  M then goes from C to A</i><br>
<i>&gt; through D, going from -5m/s to 5m/s, transferring -10gm/s of momentum to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the centrifuge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Net change in momentum: -5 + 20 + -5 + -10 = *0*.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It does not work.  It will not go.  Sorry, Mike.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Trust me, I know how you feel - I, too, had a cherished Great Idea, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; luckily found the flaw *before* it was published.</i><br>
