I hadn't planed on writing on this subject so soon after my last post, but it <br>
seems that lately I can't walk to my mailbox without finding another important <br>
article about Quantum Computers. I keep thinking about Nuclear Physics in the <br>
late 1930's.        <br>
<p>
Most people thought that error correcting codes for Quantum Information was <br>
impossible, and this would be very bad news for Quantum Computers because <br>
these machines will certainly make errors, no doubt about it. It turns out <br>
however that most people were wrong, late last year Peter Shor of ATT found a <br>
quantum error correcting code. The trouble was, although Shor's idea worked <br>
well for storing and transmitting quantum information without error, it did <br>
not work for the actual calculation, many thought that surely was impossible. <br>
It turns out they were wrong about that too.<br>
<p>
In the August 30 1996 issue of Science is an article by J. I. Cira,  <br>
T. Pellizzari, and P. Zoller entitled "Enforcing Coherent Evolution In  <br>
Dissipative Quantum Dynamics". They propose a Quantum error correcting scheme <br>
with modest computational overhead that would dramatically increase the <br>
number of quantum logic gates the machine could have before errors made it <br>
unreliable. If p is probability that a single gate will fail, then without <br>
error correction, a Quantum Computer can only have 1/p gates as a practical <br>
matter. With this new quantum error correcting code it can have 4/p^2 gates <br>
before errors overwhelm it. For example, if the probability that one gate <br>
will fail is .09 then if you have no error correction your Quantum Computer<br>
better not have more that 11 logic gates, with this new error correcting idea <br>
it could have 494 logic gates without making more errors than the 11 did. <br>
 <br>
Apparently the appeal of making a calculation on 2^n numbers at the same time  <br>
with a machine that only has n qbits is too strong for the military to ignore.  <br>
In the same issue of Science is an article about the defense department  <br>
making a 5 million dollar grant to start an institute for Quantum Information  <br>
and Computing (QUIC).  It's charter has 5 aims.<br>
<p>
1) Improve quantum algorithms.<br>
2) Improve quantum logic gates. <br>
3) Improve the architecture of Quantum Computers. <br>
4) Improve quantum error correcting codes.<br>
5) Study the general theory behind quantum computation.<br>
