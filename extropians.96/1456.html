I'm in favor of some such list. I have just unsubscribed from transhuman<br>
list and am about to unsubscribe from the extropy list because even just<br>
scanning the often 40 or more messages a day is, to me, not worth the<br>
benefit - too many insults, too much irrationality and too much shooting<br>
from the hip. Yet, there are a number of very knowledgable, highly<br>
intelligent and polite writers on these lists. I like the concept of peer<br>
reviewed contribution admission to a public list.<br>
<p>
Anyone want to run with this ball?<br>
