After the planthuman discussion i briefly toyed with the ethics of using<br>
sentient (wether extraterrestial or not) lifefroms for consumption. I<br>
decided not to post anything about it then, but some recent postings have<br>
convinced me i should.<br>
<p>
1) Just to summon up what's been said already, and to bring back some<br>
discussion to a point where it split up into a discussion on vegetarianism,<br>
and a rational vs emotional discussion.:  (remember i 'adjusted' my views a<br>
little, for the purpose of creating some thoughts...)<br>
<p>
<p>

(someone)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I was also thinking about the idea of farming humans to eat.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;In a goal-attainment </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sense, farming humans for food is not "wrong". But why does it feel wrong?  </i><br>
<p>
(then someone wrote:)<br>
<i>&gt;I wonder if this is how cannibal psychopaths feel? We use emotions to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sympathize with other animals which is our sense of "others". Its probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;closely linked to self-awareness. If you are absolute logic and zero</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotion, cannibalism wouldn't be a problem which brings up the interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt;question if emotion and consciousness are inseparable.</i><br>
<p>

<p>
<i>&gt;	But, do feelings and emotions not have a logical and reasonable</i><br>

<i>&gt;Self-preservation?  Attainment of wealth?  I maintain that emotions ARE</i><br>
<i>&gt;designed logically, just designed generally on an unconscious level hence</i><br>
<i>&gt;we are sometimes unable to see the reasoning behind them.</i><br>

someone wrote:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; to eat animals?</i><br>

<i>&gt;It of course depends on your ethical system; animals do eat animals, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;animal meat is part of our original diet. We can choose to be vegitarian </i><br>
<i>&gt;or not, but there is no "natural" reason for it.</i><br>
<p>
**Point one: I'd like to add to this by stating that canibalism is very<br>
'natural' and common among animals ...so maybe we are not animals...<br>
<p>
<p>
then anders wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;2 Meat is inefficient to produce, and thus wastes too much valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources (this suggests that lower forms of life like insects and fish</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be acceptable since they can be bred more efficiently). This view</i><br>
<i>&gt;may or may not be relevant on Earth right now, but it would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasonable in an O'Neill colony or smiliar small biosphere. </i><br>
<p>
**point two: an efficient approach for dealing with already available<br>
resources would therefore suggest, we first eat all available animals, and<br>
then start farming more resource efficient food. (wether on an overpopulated<br>
earth or on a colony planet...) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3 Eating meat reduces the complexity of the world somewhat, so "higher" </i><br>
<i>&gt;animals should be avoided (are there plants more complex than animals?). </i><br>
<i>&gt;This is really a sub-version of 1, where the meme is "complexity is good". </i><br>
<p>
**so what is it ? 'complexity is good' or 'efficiency is good'. 'higher'<br>
animals are our direct competitors in the food chain. The only reason we can<br>
decide to keep them alive, is in a situation where humans don't need to eat<br>
them. You've just stated they use a lot of resources...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A modest proposal? :-) I think it is a bad idea on purely medical grounds </i><br>
<i>&gt;- - if you eat the meat of humans you can get human diseases from it, while </i><br>
<i>&gt;the meat of other species usually is safe. </i><br>
<p>
**Which ofcourse is because we CHECK our animals we breed for consumption,<br>
for those transmittable diseases, whereas we don't check humans... <br>

Then the following was said in a strange discussion about Ants:<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>&gt;Subject: Ants</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;} vanquished an ant infestation, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What's your trick?  I've beaten back a few with soapy water, the Finger</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of Doom, and patience.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Damien asked about how I get rid of ants. I spray Raid along the crevice</i><br>
<i>&gt;where the wall meets the floor. It stinks. Ants still come in when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;rains. I read, I forget where, that ants will not cross a line of flour. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;haven't tested that.</i><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
**Now i don't know if some of you may be aware of the recent discovery that<br>
Ants have a 'necropolis' and show signs of sentience... To further encourage<br>
thought, i have replaced the word ANT, by the word HUMAN in a rewriting of<br>
the previous discussion.<br>

Now after you've stopped laughing, think for a few minutes and read on..<br>
<p>
<p>
Here's where i'm heading:<br>
<p>
1) Ants could be 'sentient' yet Anders (among many others) suggest we start<br>
eating them (insects) as they make up 40% of all the animals on earth, are<br>
very rich in proteine etc.<br>
<p>
2) Now on the other hand 'farming' humans for consumption seems to result in<br>
some ethical problems, as we ourselves are human. How will this change when<br>
we become posthuman ? Are some of you suggesting we treat humans as a<br>
different species ? And if so, should we not start expanding our ethical<br>
view to 'other species' including the same values in dealing with other<br>
species that show signs of sentience ? Something which may become important<br>
in excactly how we will regard sentience in the future, as our visions of<br>
that are still very anthropomorphous. <br>
