<p>
The practicum for my master's degree focused on online facilitation, <br>
so my participation in listserves has been on several levels--as a <br>
participant and a meta-observer.<br>
<p>
I have noticed on this list a dynamic tension between two values/goals:  <br>
constructive intellectual debate and propogation of Extropian memes.  <br>
Various proposals regarding list efficiency have conciously or <br>
conciously emphasized one of these value/goals at the expense of the <br>
other.  <br>
<p>
Given that this list has only recently become more open, I could <br>
speculate that this is the natural fallout of list expansion.  This <br>
list could also be viewed as a coalition effort, however, and coalitions <br>
take work to maintain.  This is where filtering mechanisms fail to <br>
effectively promote more cohesive discussion.  Members must be willing to <br>
address problems with the person(s) involved, not simply turn their <br>
backs and never speak to the person again.  I saw one post regarding <br>
a sort of mentoring process--it would be interesting to hear that <br>
expanded upon.<br>
<p>
I have heard Max and other Extropians state that it is vital to <br>
respect every person's level of development.  Therefore, my one <br>
request is that participants in this discussion shift terminology <br>
away from loaded terms like "quality" and "better/worse" to more <br>
defined terms like "effective", "productive".  <br>
<p>
I won't put myself in the position of supporting any particular <br>
proposal, as I respect the longstanding involvement of most of the <br>
members of this list, but I am willing to provide my own obervations <br>
as they seem appropriate.<br>
<p>
