<i>&gt;My experience of this list is that people always speak out if the disagree</i><br>

<i>&gt;lack of responses to my original mail as agreement by the list, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagreement (and hence disagreement with you).</i><br>
<p>
I wrote to Sarah privately, saying:<br>
<i>&gt;I think this is a mistake.  I often don't reply to things I disagree</i><br>
<i>&gt;with.  Replying depends on having time, thinking the othe discussants</i><br>
<i>&gt;are worth talking with, and thinking email is a good forum for that</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of discussion.</i><br>
<p>
Sarah posted again:<br>
<i>&gt;However, in the light of Robin Hanson's corroborative post I must say it</i><br>
<i>&gt;seems I was wrong. In some ways I think that's a shame: if people disagree</i><br>
<i>&gt;with me I'd like to know. For instance, Robin and I had a short discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt;some time ago which showed me flaws in my thinking and allowed me to revise</i><br>
<i>&gt;my ideas on gender very productively. I'd hate to think I might have missed</i><br>
<i>&gt;that chance.</i><br>
<p>
The quality of a mailing list is a fragile thing.  If just takes a few<br>
"bad apples" willing to post enough junk, and then people will stop<br>
bothering to post a reply to every post they think is below par.  And<br>
it goes down from there.<br>
<p>
I think the net is in great need of some innovate alternatives to the<br>
stark alternatives of open vs. moderated lists.  One idea I've played<br>
with is a list pair, one open and one closed (to posting, but readable<br>
by all).  To apply for membership in the closed list, you submit five<br>
of your recent posts to the open list, which are forwarded to three<br>
random closed list members for consideration.<br>
<p>
The personal filter concept that this list used to have doesn't work I<br>
think.  It is important to have a common sense of what some community<br>
is seeing.<br>
