&lt;&lt;<br>
It must be that the CS you dispersed was simply carried up quickly by <br>
the radiant heat of the flame rather than actually burning and thus <br>
releasing toxic fumes. I would imagine that you may still have <br>
had low-level cyanide exposure. <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Mose gas grenade designs with which I am acquainted do indeed use the <br>
heat source to drive the _boil-off_, not combustion, of agent+carrier. <br>
Most also (in the fine print) say not to use the device in an enclosed area, <br>
but they don't say why. :) Two reasons might be setting a frame <br>
building on fire, and formation of toxic byproducts. Of course, <br>
people ignore gas grenade instructions all the time, or the only place CS <br>
and CN grenades would be used would be concrete-walled riverbeds. <br>
(1/2 g)<br>
<p>
Both HCN and phosgene have tolerable-but-bad-for-you dose levels.<br>
BTW, an electric spark would probably make a lot more phosgene than <br>
an open flame would--the open flame would tend to break the phosgene <br>
molecule down further via combustion.<br>
