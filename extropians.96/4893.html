<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;If America's underclass</i><br>

Nope, it was Eliezer's quote.<br>

<i>&gt;My wife student-taught at a school in a rough part of town in 1980.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It was common for the students to set lockers on fire during the day;</i><br>
<i>&gt;this happened several times each week.  Walking down the hall, past the</i><br>
<i>&gt;shells of burned-out lockers, still black and (in some cases) smoking,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you might have thought you were in a war zone.</i><br>

It was the trashcans at my highschool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Students would routinely</i><br>
<i>&gt;skip class, parents didn't care, and it was generally not a place where</i><br>
<i>&gt;much learning occured (the exception was the advanced classes, where</i><br>
<i>&gt;the kids were highly motivated).</i><br>
