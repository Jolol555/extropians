<p>
I agree that's a big if and probably the reason why it won't work and<br>
therefore the reason why I won't be doing it. Still the method,<br>
objectively, seems quite reasonable to me and it is only because bad chain<br>
letters have ruined things for me that the idea wouldn't work. Too bad, as<br>
usual the bad often ruin things for the good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What about your reputation?</i><br>
<p>
My rule of operation is *never* to think about my reputation per se. To the<br>
extent I do right, I will earn and will have a good reputation. To the<br>
extent I do wrong, I will deserve and will have a bad reputation. Doing<br>
right or wrong is all that I need be concerned about.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, if I'm not mistaken, at about the word "pay" it stopped being merely</i><br>
<i>&gt;obnoxious and started being illegal.  To miscellaneous government</i><br>
<i>&gt;agencies, the US Postal Service among them, I think "chain letter" +</i><br>
<i>&gt;"money" = "pyramid scheme"</i><br>
<p>
That's news to me. I pay so little attention to many legalities (always<br>
being much more concerned about right and wrong) that I did not know money<br>
payment chain letters were illegal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I certainly wasted time (not much money, fortunately) on such things in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;young and foolish days, [which, for you, were soooo long ago :)]</i><br>
<p>
This made me smile and take some pleasure from the implication that at 58,<br>
I might still be capable of being "young and foolish".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;when I knew less about both statistics and social psych.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, this could be taken as a comment that I don't know anything<br>
about these subjects :-)<br>
