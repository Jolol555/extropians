[Eliezer Yudkowsky on the uses of quantum computers]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Think genetic programming.  Current "populations" are in the 10^3-10^6</i><br>
<i>&gt; range.  With a 64-qubit QC, you could have a population of sixteen</i><br>
<i>&gt; billion billion.  Heck, with a 64-qubit QC, you could probably string</i><br>
<i>&gt; instructions together completely at random and wind up with the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful solution immediately.  Who needs evolutionary computation?  </i><br>
<p>
I thought along similar lines; I thought quantum parallelism would make<br>
constraint satisfaction problems (e.g. "find a path that passes through<br>
every vertex of this graph without intersecting itself") easy:<br>
Just put the quantum computer into a superposition that covers every <br>
element of the search space, and filter the superposition by asking some <br>
yes/no question about all its elements at once.<br>
<p>
Then I saw this thread and asked myself, "How would this actually work?",<br>
and decided to look for expert opinion:<br>

  [...] This requirement appears to be a general one: Quantum parallelism <br>
  will only yield an exponential speedup in problems whose structure avoids <br>
  the need to try exponentially many solutions.  Thus, a brute force approach <br>
  to some of the hardest computational questions, known as NP-complete <br>
  problems, will not succeed with the aid of quantum parallelism. [...]<br>
<p>
The point is that there is only a limited set of measurements you can<br>
perform on a real quantum system. The question you ask at the "read-out" <br>
step (e.g. "does the fitness measure exceed this cutoff?") must be <br>
practically computable, you have to be able to get at that information. <br>
<p>
In the case of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, there's a specific<br>
trick which makes it possible to find factors (see<br>
<a href="http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~schmuel/comp/node14.html">http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~schmuel/comp/node14.html</a>). But no one<br>
seems to know yet just what class of problems allows a speedup:<br>

  The real future of quantum computers occurs if a general computer can be <br>
  built.  This is what allowed classical computers to take off, since you no <br>
  longer needed to build a "one-task" computer (typically an analog computer). <br>
  If a general quantum computer (one that can be programmed, in some sense, <br>
  to solve many different problems on the once computer) can be constructed, <br>
  they are set to change the way computation is thought about.  If not, then <br>
  basically we are stuck with building computers that can only solve a very <br>
  limited group of problems (be it very quickly), restricting their <br>
  usefullness.<br>

  <br>
Q-gol - a high-level programming language for quantum computers!<br>
But still buggy, it seems. Elsewhere in his web (see the "summary" page), <br>
this guy says he's defined a whole set of generalizations of ordinary <br>
computation (of which quantum computation is just one), including one<br>
appropriate for time-travelling computation (in which you might have<br>
access to information from the future).<br>
<p>
Damien Broderick added:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If you crossed a quantum computer with Borges's Library of Babel, it struck</i><br>
<i>&gt; me a while back, might you destructively interfere all the `wrong'</i><br>
<i>&gt; descriptions of physics, being left with a single Book of True Everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Abridged)?  I  love the idea that you could turn on the infinite monkey</i><br>
<i>&gt; machine and get out Ed Witten Mark Aleph Null.</i><br>
<p>
The problem here (apart from general problems of implementation mentioned<br>
above): what do you use as your filtering criterion, to screen out the <br>
wrong descriptions?<br>
