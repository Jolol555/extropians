I just realized that I've posted no intro to this list, so I will now <br>
indicate that I am a professional "process person", practicing <br>
mediation, facilitation, and system design.  This is the perspective <br>
from which I asked Robin about list insularity.<br>
<p>
In light of Harry Hawk's comments, I will rephrase that into <br>
"avoid degenerating too far in the direction of intellectual <br>
insularity".  "Minority views" would include not only groups of <br>
persons numerically smaller but also new insights or approaches that <br>
might initially seem threatening to the established approaches.<br>
<p>
Robin Hanson replies:<br>
<i>&gt;I'd pin my hopes on the fact that a sister open list exists which a </i><br>
<i>&gt;large fraction of the closed list people read.</i><br>
<p>
You originally presented your idea as comprised of two sister lists.<br>
A dynamic could develop wherein persons on the restricted list would <br>
notice posts on the open list that related to their issue areas, but <br>
my own experience with a somewhat similar structure indicates otherwise.<br>
<p>
I have resided on a list-within-list structure, but the inner list <br>
was by invitation only and required clearance by several inner list <br>
members.  The two lists dealt with a human rights issue, and the outer <br>
list occupied the harassers while the real work was conducted on the <br>
inner list, which could not be read by the outer list.  <br>
Eventually many persons on the inner list unsubbed from the outer <br>
list, considering it a distraction.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
