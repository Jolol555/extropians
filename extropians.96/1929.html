I was watching Discovery Magazine on the Discovery channel tonite, and they<br>
meantioned that life could've possibly formed in the shallow seas on Mars<br>
when the planet was young. They meantioned that likely tufa tower formations<br>
have been seen in dry lake basins on Mars and they will send a probe by<br>
sometime in the future to verify that these are tufa formations. They say<br>
that these tufa towers provide lots of little cracks for life to latch onto<br>
in Mono Lake in California so why not on Mars. They meantioned that tufa<br>
towers on Mars would be a great place to look for fossilized life due to the<br>
quantity that could possibly be found there and that they find fossilized<br>
(sp?) life in the tufa towers in Mono Lake constantly. For those that don't<br>
know, there is a lake in california called Mono Lake which due to it's<br>
bizarre chemical makeup creates these towers of mineral deposits which rise<br>
up out of the highly salty lake. Does anyone know if these can be found<br>
anywhere else? This idea has really inspired me also being the fact that<br>
they've always said that Mono Lake looked as though it was from another<br>
planet! I've been to Mono Lake myself and it's a cool place to explore.<br>
Highly recommended. Check it out if you are near Mammoth Lakes. Oh yeah and<br>
if my writing looks rhetorical and like crap it's cuz I'm damn tired right now.<br>
