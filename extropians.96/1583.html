Several people have mentioned that the traffic on this list is getting so<br>
heavy that they don't have time to deal with it. I feel the same way. There<br>
have been many interesting threads and ideas on this list, and I hate to<br>
unsubscribe but there are ridiculous numbers of posts to wade through,<br>
especially if one is away for a few days. <br>
<p>
One reason the quality of the list was so high in the past, I believe, was<br>
the ability of a subscriber to do sophisiticated filtering so as to only see<br>
the threads and/or posters considered worthwhile. Now we have to do this in<br>
our own mail programs, which means downloading everything.<br>
<p>
There is definitely a point of diminishing returns. Max, is there any chance<br>
of charging some fee and getting hold of a list management program that can<br>
do filtering like the old one did? If some solution isn't developed for this<br>
problem, this list is going to rapidly degrade, because people who are only<br>
peripherally involved will be forced to disengage. <br>
