About the book ESCAPE VELOCITY<br>
<p>
I am quite familiar with it, as I just taught a course at Rutgers<br>
University for which it was one of the "textbooks."  The course<br>
was called FURUT  oops,  FUTURE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY, and along<br>
with EV we used a book called Frontiers of Complixity, which <br>
covers Alife, AIU ... oops, AUI oops, AI (must get a new editor<br>
) and so forth.<br>
<p>
Esc. Vel. is a very well thought out and well researched book,<br>
and the writing is good.  THere is a big focus on artsy stuff --<br>
survival research labs, techno &amp; industrial music, Stelarc &amp;<br>
other postmodern techno-savvy artists.  but there is a lot of<br>
intelligent discussion of the role of the body in futuristic<br>
technology ... "downloading" ... the way that the same pel<br>
peo0ple promoting this technology are "nerds" who maybe <br>
uncomfortable with their own bodies, etc.<br>
<p>
Generally, Dery (the author) is skeptical of the "antisocial"<br>
aspects of transhumanism, and he mentions Extropians in this<br>
light.  His attitude is much like mine, though he is less<br>
enthused about such things as downloading the mind than I am<br>
.  He interviews Moravec, and asks him what downloading of the<br>
mind m eans for the downtrodden billions who don't even have<br>
computers.  Moravec says, basically, "tough luck for them;<br>
humans are becoming obsolete, so a few billion more or less<br>
doesn't make much difference."  Dery finds this unconsciounable.<br>
<p>
I think Dery finds Extropianism somewhat scary in its alignment<br>
of future tech with libertarian, hyper-individualist politics.<br>
He would like to see future tech with a social conscience.<br>
<p>
This book was, incidentally, where I heard about Extropians,<br>
