<i>&gt;Point being, that a hyperintelligent mind is likely to be less subject to</i><br>
<i>&gt;mathematical behavior analysis than we are, not less.  It's likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;less "logical" in it's reasons, that the arbitrariness of humanity.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain to be more complex.   A "social" group of such &gt;H minds is likely</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be unfathenable in its behavior--and perhaps very inefficient and</i><br>
<i>&gt;illogical to outside analysis indeed.</i><br>
Could this mean that the culture of mysticism and it's illogical behavior<br>
could mean that people who believe in such are ahead of the rest of us??<br>
People believing in mysticism tap into many more emotions than atheists<br>
through "religious experiences". Is that where we're headed? Is religion a<br>
natural part of culture and intelligence except now due to our ability to<br>
control our fate, WE ARE BECOMING the gods through transhumanism?<br>
