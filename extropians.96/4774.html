<i>&gt; I think I proposed that open list members submit a set of 5 of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; posts to the open list, this submission going to a jury of 3 randomly</i><br>
<i>&gt; selected closed list members.  This minimizes the reading load of</i><br>
<i>&gt; closed list members. </i><br>
<p>
If a limited list has inherent value, why not take the obvious,<br>
simple, and fair approach of charging for it?  Only those with<br>
enough serious interest to participate and support the list would<br>
join, and that level of participation could be adjusted by price.<br>
That would also prevent a scheme like that above from excluding<br>
valuable participants with unpopular views or confrontational<br>
rhetoric, and prevent uninterested trolls from sneaking in by<br>
feeding 5 quick short simple posts, then flaming away.<br>
<p>
The official sanction of the Extropy institute is a valuable<br>
commodity for such a list, and I think it would be immoral not<br>
to profit from that, and to give the institute itself complete<br>
freedom to sanction and do business with whomever they choose.<br>
If they do a bad job, well then let the free market create<br>
another list to do better.<br>
