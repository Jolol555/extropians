<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;(Being a cautious person, I dislike experiments that are intended to go </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;BOOM. But I'm still proud of my utterly insane magnesium-manganese </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;dioxide-potassium chlorate mixture)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We used magnesium/potassium permanganate back then, before progressing to </i><br>
<i>&gt;ammonia nitrate-containing mixes. We made potassium chlorate from sodium </i><br>
<i>&gt;chlorate by mixing solutions of a commercial defoliant (80% sodium </i><br>
<i>&gt;chlorate) with potassium chloride. We also made aceton peroxide and </i><br>
<i>&gt;nitrogen trijodide &amp;c&amp;c.</i><br>
 <br>
Ammonium nitrate works well (9 out of 10 terrorists prefer...), but almost<br>
never detonates completely, and takes a really strong trigger to set it off.<br>
One of my favorite composites was packed ammonium nitrate soaked with<br>
nitromethane.  Much easier to detonate and TNT range performance.  Acetone<br>
peroxide makes a decent primary explosive for use in detonators, but is a<br>
little unsafe, like virtually all organic peroxides.  My favorite homemade<br>
primary was HMTD (also an organic peroxide).  Very powerful, pretty stable,<br>
and made completely from over-the-counter chemicals.  Only negative was that<br>
it chemically decomposed on contact with aluminum I believe.<br>
<p>
We used to have fun with nitrogen triiodide.  We would make large batch<br>
suspended in water, and then scatter the black precipitate in buildings and<br>
malls while it was still wet.  We would then watch people's reactions as the<br>
particles would spontaneously explode as it dried or people stepped on them.<br>
Good clean fun.<br>
<p>
Quite frankly, I am surprised I never got in trouble for doing all this<br>
stuff as a young teenager.<br>
