James Daugherty (snip of an excellent post on the economic effect of removing<br>
government intervention and the resulting balancing that could occur). <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Mankind's past is a bloody mess.</i><br>
<p>
I had to smile ... I hope I didn't offend anyone, It is not my intent to<br>
insult the other 7/8ths of my ancestry here,  I believe no one has racial<br>
immunity from meme defiency (ie stupid and unethical practices), I understand<br>
that white males are *not* the problem, and hope that you do not generalize<br>
me as just another "white male basher."<br>
<p>
I used the religious rationalization of genocide or coercion on   Indians to<br>
make the point that simple economics and simple poilitics will not completely<br>
(if at all) address the problem.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;The land in Europe was repeatedly stolen time after time though usually</i><br>
the people were of the same race and religion.  In the longer view, alien<br>
races and ethnicities repeatedly swept accross Europe looting, pillaging, and<br>
appropriating the land.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
True, and removing government wouldn't address this,  though it would<br>
certainly  cut down on existing *instituionalized* political looting.<br>
 Balancing the budget is good.  I agree with the basics of libertarian<br>
objectivist philosophy or I wouldn't be here... but if nothing internal<br>
changes ethically or in "man"kind's belief system what would prevent it<br>
happening again and again?<br>
Remember I spoke about a data base of meme defiency.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;I dare say Native Americans stole land from each other as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
Yes, I stated this.  I wrote (snip):<br>
" ...or  illmotivated tribes take land by force, then keep it by force, it<br>
starts a  Might is Right chain."<br>
<p>
James: <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;While I do not want in the slightest to minimize the theft of land by</i><br>
Europeans which occured all over the globe during the Imperialist era,<br>
historical wrongs cannot be "brought to book" on collective racial or ethic<br>
basis.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Nadia:<br>
I am specifically talking about *individual* ethics, not collective. <br>
 I agree Might is Right is cross cultural and cross religious. It exists in<br>
inner cities and in Beverly Hills, and it will probably expand to outerspace<br>
if "inner space" doesn't change.  Eptistomological (belief) systems that are<br>
in place today  do not seem to encourage self ownership or individuality or<br>
rational thinking.<br>
I *strongly* disagree about ethics not playing a part.<br>
 Members of my ancestor's tribe (the Chehalis/Chinook) took slaves.  They<br>
were a very peaceful tribe, with little need for anything, being the area's<br>
most prosperous fishing tribe.  This wasn't a result of economics.  It was<br>
lack of ethics.  Slavery was not ethical.  It was *wrong*.  However,<br>
economically it must have seemed like a good opportunity to some. : -)<br>
Overnight Libertarian political freedom looks like the ultimate test of what<br>
would happen if  economic *and* individual ethics (optimal embracing of self<br>
ownership worldwide, for example) is not brought to bear..<br>
My question is how, without the blatantly unlibertarian tactics of coercion<br>
or indoctrination (used by typical takeover governments and communist<br>
regimes) would this occur?<br>
