The September 30 issue of Business Week magazine has a one-page article (page <br>
42) about the Tampere Anti-Gravity Device.  They confirm that the report on the <br>
device that was to appear in Journal of Physics-D: Applied Physics has been <br>
withdrawn by the authors.  The article says, however, that many scientists are <br>
taking very seriously the possibility that the device may be for real.<br>
<p>
NASA, as well as other laboratories in Italy, Canada, and India to trying to <br>
duplicate the device.  The Business Week article says that the issue of whether <br>
or not the effect is real should be settled in the next few weeks.  (As far as <br>
scientific controversies go, that time frame may be quite optimistic.)<br>
