RE Eric Lerner's "The Big Bang Never happened", Ian Goddard noted:<br>
<p>
"At 01:32 PM 8/7/96 EDT, Crosby_M wrote: 'Lerner shows how the basic <br>
assumptions of the Big Bang theory have been  refuted by observation.'  IAN: <br>
How does he write off the appearance of universal expansion due to the <br>
red-shift of all starlight ?"<br>
<p>
My statement that "the basic assumptions of the Big Bang theory have been <br>
refuted" was a poor choice of words.  Basically, I think Lerner proposes an <br>
evolving universe driven mostly by dynamic electrical and magnetic currents <br>
generated at the gallactic level, as well as the more static gravitational <br>
forces of history that dominate general relativity and conventional <br>
cosmology.  When these forces are incorporated into theory, he sees no need <br>
for a Big Bang and some of its appendages, like black holes and dark matter.<br>
<p>
The red-shift, or "Hubble relationship" as Lerner refers to it, is "still a <br>
mystery", he admits.  In fact he devotes an appendix to the several theories <br>
on this, such as Alfven's antimatter theories and the various "tired light" <br>
theories first started by Dirac.  Lerner summarizes these thus: "light may <br>
lose energy as it travels through space, shifting it to red.  Or perhaps all <br>
objects, all space expands continuously, a certain tiny percentage a year."<br>
<p>
Another pillar of conventional cosmology is the idea that a Big Bang is <br>
necessary to explain the smooth cosmic background radiation that we see at <br>
the 'edge' of the universe.  Lerner, instead, proposes that this might not <br>
be an echo of some perfect past but rather "the glow from a radio fog <br>
produced in the present-day universe."  I'm definitely not an expert on this <br>
stuff but I might add that, perhaps, expansion is simply a side-effect of <br>
the ever-increasing complexity of matter as it evolves.<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste's comments concluded that: "If I were an astrophysicist or <br>
a cosmologist, I'd worry about the ultimate destiny of the universe, because <br>
that would be part of my job.  But I'm not, so I'll worry about it in a few <br>
hundred years, maybe."<br>
<p>
I am also not at all interested in "the ultimate destiny of the universe" <br>
EXCEPT for one reason: If there is no ultimate destiny of the universe, then <br>
that implies that we have access to unlimited creativity in the immediate <br>
reality.  I think it further implies that stages of life and intelligence <br>
beyond the human are not only possible but likely to exist already.  That's <br>
why I find 'anthropic' ideas of humans alone consuming the universe to be <br>
rather amusing (if not impertinent).  But I still endorse the "Mind <br>
Children" mission because it seems to be the next logical step in our <br>
species' diaspora "onward and outward" from the primordial tidal pool.<br>
<p>
I'm all for an empirical method of deriving one's values and theories from <br>
the evolving evidence of the immediate reality; but, let's never settle for <br>
the immediate reality and always strive to see how far we can jump beyond <br>
it.<br>
