<i>                &gt;Of course not. But this is an operational question posed                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;from *outside*  the skin of the two would-be uploaders.   </i><br>
                                 <br>
<p>
You can also ask the upload if he feels like the same person he was before, <br>
I can't see any reason not to believe him. Also, because I don't believe in <br>
an unfathomable soul I conclude that all consciousness must have a physical <br>
cause. If there is a difference in the consciousness between two unloads made <br>
by  different means, then there MUST be a physical difference of some sort <br>
between them, the only alternative is to invoke the vague mystical powers <br>
that religion and superstition so love. If Science says he is the same  <br>
person and the person says he is the same person then I feel very confident  <br>
in saying it is the same person.<br>

<i>                &gt;remains, as I posed it earlier:  would one be prepared to die                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;(sacrific one's current instantiation) in order that an                </i><br>

<i>                &gt;different substrate?  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
You would be justified in worrying about this exactly as much as you worry <br>
that you are the only conscious being in the universe, the Turing Test is  <br>
central to both ideas. If you trust it in one case you should trust it in  <br>
the other. Anyway, it's self contradictory that something could think it's me,  <br>
have my memories, think my thoughts, feel my feelings, and yet not be me,  <br>
because that's what is mente by "me". At least, that's what I mean by the word.<br>

<p>
No you have not. All you did was describe how exactly the same thing could be <br>
made in 2 different ways. Only the final product is important and if I show <br>
you that, you are unable to tell me which way it was made. If I purchase a  <br>
paperback novel there is no way I could know, nor would I care, if the author <br>
originally wrote it with a quill pen, a IBM PC, an Apple, or scribbled it on <br>
the backs of  envelopes with a crayon. The finished product is the same and <br>
that's all that matters. <br>
