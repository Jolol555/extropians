Eliezer shares, "I've been convinced that drugs are evil."<br>
<p>
Are you including ALL drugs in this condemnation?  Such a broad-sweeping <br>
generalization is almost sure to be incorrect.  Aren't there *any* drugs that <br>
you would say have a positive effect, when used properly?<br>
<p>
Talking about the crack problem, Elizer states, "The problem lies not within <br>
any humans but within the chemicals making up crack and the plants producing <br>
cocaine."<br>
<p>
Are you saying that people aren't responsible for becoming addicted to crack?  <br>
My opinion is that most people who are addicted to crack had some serious <br>
psychological problems before they ever used crack.  I have a hard time <br>
believing that someone with a healthy psychology would become addicted to such <br>
a harmful substance.  I myself have used crack several times one day, <br>
experiencing what I thought was a very mild effect.  This may have been due to <br>
the fact that I was aware that the man administering the drug was wanting to <br>
have sex with me and I was wanting to prevent myself from being taken <br>
advantage of, so I didn't allow myself to experience any overpowering effects <br>
from the drug.  The point is that crack was unable to take over my mind, <br>
because I was unwilling to allow it to.  The problem of crack addiction lies <br>
*almost entirely* within the humans who allow themselves to become addicted.  <br>
It is not the cocaine that takes over their mind; if they didn't have the <br>
drug, they would find some other way to fuck themselves up.  These people are <br>
living depressed, miserable lives; of course they want to "escape" that with <br>
drugs (which, of course, just make their problems worse).  The drug problem is <br>
first of all a psychological problem.  People are fucked up *before* they get <br>
into drugs (and more so after).  That is the problem we must deal with; the <br>
drugs themselves are not the main problem with the drug problem.<br>
<p>
Many people are depressed and have no real desire to live, and their children <br>
are raised to be the same way.  This is the root of the drug problem.  People, <br>
in general, don't know how to live happy, fulfilling lives -- it is a skill <br>
that requires much personal discipline, and people simply aren't trained with <br>
that skill, in general.  There is very little in our society which teaches <br>
people the intense personal discipline required to live a happy, fulfilling <br>
life.  Most people in our society don't even view happiness and fulfillment as <br>
the result of personal discipline; most people don't think it's something they <br>
can learn to control and create in their own lives; happiness  to them is an <br>
elusive quality that comes and goes unpredibtably.  Until people learn the <br>
skills required to live a happy fulfilling life, the drug problem will never <br>
go away.  Even if we could somehow get rid of all drugs, people would still be <br>
fucked up, until they learn personal discipline and learn to take personal <br>
responsibility for and control of their own lives and minds.<br>
<p>
Drug abuse and drug addiction are the results of much deeper problems, which <br>
have nothing to do with drugs.<br>
<p>

which turn humans against each other *are*. --<br>
