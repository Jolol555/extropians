I'm glad you think so. Then perhaps you can answer what has become my<br>
favorite question of late: has anyone managed to get artificial<br>
unsupervised feedback networks to do *anything* interesting?<br>
<p>
I've only just started poking around, but it seems to me that other than a<br>
few abortive efforts in the late '80s when neural-net research woke up<br>
again, all the work going on has been in supervised nets and feedforward<br>
nets, and that no one has the foggiest idea how unsupervised feedback nets<br>
do their stuff. (I know you know this, Eugene, but for those who are<br>
following this and don't already know, our best current<br>
computational-process-model of the brain is the unsupervised feedback net<br>
model.)<br>
<p>
Last time I checked progress was pretty stagnant even with supervised<br>
feedback nets.<br>
<p>
So it seems to me that this is a gaping chasm before us in k-space (or<br>
World 3 or whatever you want to call it) and no one is currently working on<br>
bridging it.<br>
They're working *toward* bridging it, by investigating simpler nets and<br>
fuzzy systems, but not yet *on* bridging it. And as far as I know, the best<br>
mathematical models we have for unsupervised feedback nets are ragingly<br>
nonlinear and not useful for much. Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;But don't you see, it is all in the details! If you know both the physics</i><br>
<i>&gt;and have an exhausting knowledge of the structures, the insights you gain</i><br>
<i>&gt;are solely limited by the available modeling power. If you know how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing works at an abstract level, then you can build a surrogate, an</i><br>
<i>&gt;ersatz neuron.</i><br>
<p>
And then simulate 100 billion of them at miniscule tolerances? Sure, maybe<br>
brute force will work. But the history of classical AI is a history of the<br>
failure of brute-force approaches (along with some stunningly fabulous<br>
spinoffs, I must add). My hunch (and it's nothing more than that) is that<br>
we will succeed neither in AI nor in uploading nor in developing<br>
"superintelligence" by some other means until we have a theoretical<br>
understanding of the computational process that we call mind. And while the<br>
progress that has been made has led to an explosion of useful technology,<br>
it hasn't really gotten us any closer to seeing how to cross that<br>
aforementioned gaping chasm. Again, please correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<p>
I understand if you disagree with me because you are confident of the<br>
future possibilities in brute-force simulation, but if you disagree with me<br>
about the path toward a theoretical understanding of what intelligence is,<br>
I'd really like to hear about it.<br>
<p>
And I long ago decided that since cryonics is just a time-transport<br>
technology, indefinite human lifespan will require either uploading or<br>
*really* drastic meddling with adult gene-expression. So if any of you out<br>
there are disheartened about the prospects for uploading and also want<br>
indefinite lifespans, I recommend studying molecular biology and embryology<br>
and human genetics and all that.<br>

<i>&gt;Apart from quantum dot 3d arrays, which is but a lab curiousity (no</i><br>
<i>&gt;arrays yet, just dots), I have failed to notice the advent of maspar</i><br>
<i>&gt;machines in the laboratory or the 'real' world. If one comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;think of it, especially in the real world. Alas, one cannot teach old</i><br>
<i>&gt;programmers new tricks. Remember what happened to Danny Hillis and Thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;Machines? (I know they are alive again/still).</i><br>
<p>
Sure. One of the reasons we can't program them is because we don't yet have<br>
a useful mathematical model of the only existence proof of a<br>
massively-parallel supercomputer, the brain. Some useful hardware advances<br>
happen serendipitously, but I think in this case theory is going to have to<br>
precede technology.<br>
