In a message dated 96-12-23 06:44:21 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt; &lt;&lt; sex is pleasurable by default for men, but</i><br>
<i> &gt;  not for women. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; Not true</i><br>
 <br>
 You mean it would always be fun, even if the guy only lasts three <br>
 seconds? Or should I have emphasised the 'by default'?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It is psychological, his "lasting" or not, usually...and it could be fun, if<br>
that was what the woman 'got off on"... and besides, is that "fun" for the<br>
guy?<br>
In most cases,  I think it would be humiliating unless his partner is really<br>
trustworthy and loving.<br>
<p>
Whoever made that post made a sweeping statement that took nothing into<br>
account except possibly equating the physical default of relative easiness of<br>
clitoral vs. penile orgasm during a (forced?) missionary position. Orgasm is<br>
not the sum total of sexual "fun", in fact for some men it is something to be<br>
avoided for while.... Tantric experts can avoid it altogether and they still<br>
have "fun".<br>
<p>
And it is also (to the grins of many women I am sure) making the assumption<br>
that (among other things), women will be choosing men as their partners...<br>
<p>
What I am saying is that this kind of blanket statement is never true or<br>
objective, only someones' subjective view, and a narrow one.<br>
