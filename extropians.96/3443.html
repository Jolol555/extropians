Something VERY BAD has occurred. I was discussing the possibilities of<br>
nanotech with my father when the idea came to my mother that in "The Book<br>
of Revelation" in the Bible it says something to the effect of "People will<br>
search for death but death will flee from them" and she contributed that<br>
factor to nanotech. She's anti-nano now and shes already spread the meme to<br>
a few others and even worse is the fact that she's the leader of a church<br>
fellowship! Aughhh!! She better not spread that meme any further. Memes<br>
like this will continue to develop and we MUST STOP THEM by throwing out<br>
counter memes.<br>
