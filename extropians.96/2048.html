More accurately, we can say that a few hundred billionaires have created<br>
more than 1% of the world's wealth.  What is rarely mentioned is that their<br>
"wealth" consists of ownership of businesses with a track record for<br>
creating excellent products and services and thousands of jobs.  Bill Gates<br>
does not have $18 bn stashed away in a closet or Swiss bank account.  His<br>
$18 bn is primarily derived from how the market values his company.<br>
<p>
Having worked for some very wealthy individuals, I can verify the<br>
observation first made by George Gilder that successful entrepreneurs are<br>
far less "greedy" than the average person on welfare.  The truly successful<br>
entrepreneur plows his money back into the business, creating more jobs and<br>
more good products.  The welfare recipient, in contrast, wants access to<br>
money earned by other people (and taken from them under threat of<br>
imprisonment).<br>
