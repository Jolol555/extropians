<i>&gt;They went to great lengths to get a computer for me to use when I was young</i><br>
<i>&gt;(circa 1980) despite the fact that we lived in poverty at the time.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;attribute my current success in the computer industry to the fact that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;bought that first computer (which I loved the instant they got it).</i><br>
<p>
Mastered Msdos 2.11 and Gwbasic at 8 yrs on my blazing 4.77Mhz XT!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A</i><br>
<i>&gt;worthwhile investment with good foresight on their part.  Sadly, they still</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't particularly computer literate.</i><br>
<p>
Same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I hold the theory that differences in measured IQ can be mostly attributed</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the environment the kid is brought up in from 0-6 years, with genetics</i><br>
<i>&gt;being a less differentiating factor.  When I was born, both my parents had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;lot of time on their hands, so they spent their time teaching me and playing</i><br>
<i>&gt;with me.</i><br>
<p>
Same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have three younger brothers, but by the time they were born, my</i><br>
<i>&gt;parents didn't have as much time anymore, and they had to divide their</i><br>
<i>&gt;attention among more kids.</i><br>
<p>
Same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;noticeable pattern in the IQs of my siblings and myself that can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;correlated to certain environmental factors.</i><br>
<p>
I'm thinking introvert. My second youngest brother was highly social from<br>
the start where I was an introvert and had to work my way out. I think this<br>
was largely due to not having children my own age in my local area, when he<br>
did so I gradually turned to other forms of more intellectual entertainment<br>
like tinkering or reading. Also I must add it was a plus to have my parents<br>
read to me early on. How many people here skipped crawling and went<br>
directly on to walking?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hehe.  Something similar happened to me.  I became disinterested in what I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was being taught in high school (primarily because it was *so damn boring*)</i><br>
<i>&gt;and studied, in great depth, things that I was interested in like AI, coding</i><br>
<i>&gt;theory, high-energy physics, chemistry, etc.</i><br>
<p>
Yep.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Absurdly high test scores (usually perfect) and very average grades.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;always kind of wondered how universities interpret that kind of pattern.</i><br>
<p>
Probably not good. It shows signs of nonconforming gifted intelligence<br>
which would not work in a structured university.<br>
