That was a very interesting line, it didn't make any sense at all. :-)<br>
(Sorry, I couldn't resist. The quoted line is definitely going into my <br>
quote collection)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are mathematical spaces, derived from mathematics.  There are</i><br>

<i>&gt; cognitive science - which of these is your "deity space" derived from? </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From your post, I'm guessing cognitive science.</i><br>
<p>
That seems most likely. The definition of "space" in cognitive science is <br>
quite loose, and perhaps more akin to a set. As a partial mathematician I <br>
sometimes wince at how the word is used - defining a neighborhood in a <br>
conceptual space is hard. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, by the power vested in me by being "Mr. Singularity", I pronounce</i><br>
<i>&gt; your "deity space" null and void.  I have no reason whatsoever to</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that a Power would fit in whatever cognitive space controls our</i><br>
<i>&gt; perception of really powerful beings.  As far as I can tell, the epitome</i><br>
<i>&gt; of your average "deity space" is a human at the top of the pecking</i><br>
<i>&gt; order, someone who does whatever the imaginer would do if granted</i><br>
<i>&gt; unlimited power.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Does this make deity space pointless? Not at all. If Powers emerge,<br>
then they might be the truly powerful beings, while humans continue to be<br>
impressed by their user interfaces, pets or garbage (not to mention<br>
posthumans with a sense of humour who play gods, of course. Anybody care<br>
for a post-singularity masquerade on mount Olympus?). <br>
<p>
What is important to realize that real power, perceived power, divinity, <br>
and the beliefs of people are interlinked in interesting and important <br>
ways. Whatever tools helps us to understand this area (such as deity <br>
spaces) are useful.<br>
