The body's physiology is much too complicated there are 1000's of<br>
independent hormones, enzymes, etc. which you would have to control. The<br>
only way you can approximate this at present is by hypothermia wherein you<br>
both cool and replace the blood (it gets too viscous and self-coagulating<br>
below about 20'C) with an electrolyte solution (no need for the hemoglobin<br>
since at that temperature, the dissolved oxygen in sufficient to run the<br>
slowed metabolic processes). 21st Century Medicine has recovered dogs<br>
without permanent deficits from 5.3 hours below 40'F with this technique.<br>
But it requires continuous perfusion and has not (yet) been time extended<br>
for whole-bodies (ie. for multiple organ types). Their goal for this work<br>
is to perfect flush-cool-ship-on-ice of humans where no damage would be<br>
done for up to 10 hours (sufficient time for some pretty long range<br>
shipping). Any more than this without full long-term suspended animation<br>
below the glass transition temperature is really hard to conceive being<br>
possible this side of the singularity and, personally, I don't believe that<br>
our nanotechnological/singularity dreams will come through for at least 50 <br>
and more likely 100.<br>

I am *not* trained in medicine nor biology for that matter. I was a<br>
professor of Mathematics and Physics. However, it is my understanding that<br>
in all the cases of cold water drowning, or outdoors cooling and revival,<br>
the core temperature of the individual has never been below 20'C. If is<br>
does then they are not recoverable with today's medicine.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;I guess I just see use of such blunt raw force approaches as being not</i><br>

<i>&gt;life going to be for someone who has to grow back 75% of their body (or</i><br>

<i>&gt;be cheaper to freeze someone at the start, what are the costs going to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be at the other end to revive the person, and then rebuild them?</i><br>
<p>
Aha! You are confusing suspended animation with cryonics as currently<br>
practiced. The whole purpose of the Prometheus Project is for the process<br>
to be fully reversible here and now, with today's medicine (at least the<br>
"today" at the end of the Project). Since no "rebuilding" will need to take<br>
place (except curing their terminal condition -- which might have been<br>
aging itself), the cost will not be that great. In any case the whole<br>
economics is a matter of how much money they can put away, what its growth<br>
rate is and what the cost of reviving the fixing them has been reduced to.<br>
I agree that it is conceivable that some people preserved either by<br>
cryonics or true suspended animation may only ever be restored by the<br>
charity of some others (or maybe their curiosity or their loyalty to<br>
friends and relatives?). Anyway, even for cryonics your argument is mixed<br>
up. All cryonics patients will have all damage (even the regrowth of a body<br>
from a repaired brain) repaired *before* they are even brought to<br>
consciousness. Ie. the restoration time and process will be exactly the<br>
same to them as the time frozen in liquid nitrogen. Unless/until they can<br>
emerge with a young, healthy fully functional body they won't be revived. <br>

<i>&gt;I would think that it should be developed for</i><br>
<i>&gt;people waiting for organ transplants, or waiting for FDA approval of</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain possible cures. I would guess that this sort of therapy could</i><br>
<i>&gt;become a widely used strategy for the hundreds of thousands of people</i><br>
<i>&gt;worldwide who are waiting for organs....</i><br>
<p>
Again, yes, it would be wonderful to have such a process, but reality is<br>
not always to obliging. I believe that the biomed research community would<br>
simply say that is appears to be a very difficult problem and there are<br>
many other clearly more easily solvable problems with higher priority. BTW,<br>
that's close to what they say about the Prometheus Project. My job is to<br>
find enough people for which suspended animation is a high enough priority.<br>
I do this because from my examination of the timescales of the advance of<br>
science and technology, I believe that the success of the Prometheus<br>
Project (or something like it) is the only way that I (and all of you too)<br>
will have a reasonable chance to gain a vastly extended life and potential<br>
immortality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I guess I just look at the freezing concept as being really a one way</i><br>
<i>&gt;trip, like I really don't have any faith in John Clarks flash uploading</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas either. I prefer gradual uploading and soft, failsafe hybernation</i><br>
<i>&gt;techniques.</i><br>
<p>
It ain't soft and failsafe if it doesn't exist! If you or some one else<br>
produces them, I will gladly embrace them. The Prometheus Project is based<br>
on extending existing technology, not on fundamentally new scientific<br>
discoveries for which there is no time estimation possible.<br>
<p>
Actually, I would rather just stay alive and healthy and eventually have<br>
non-invasive augmentation! But I am very much concerned that even if I live<br>
to 120 (which from my, genetics, current health, and healthy lifestyle, I<br>
fully expect to do), I will reach an end of what (then) current medicine<br>
and life-extension techniques are able to do for me. The very last thing<br>
that I want is go into suspended animation even if its fully proven to be<br>
non-damaging to my body and brain/mind. But I would take a straight<br>
freezing of just my brain anytime, rather than the total obliteration of<br>
death!<br>
