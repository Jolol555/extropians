True. What I really ment with my challenge, was to show that there <br>
are ways to circumvent the Bound even without introducing unknown <br>
physics. One of the most obvious would be to let the energy increase <br>
in a region without limit, that would enable an infinite amount of <br>
information (this may happen during the Big Crunch). <br>

Perhaps. But it has been rather quiet on the string front, I think <br>
the theory got stuck in mathematics and didn't get to the physical <br>
side. Still, some results are fascinating.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Beware, in a stringy universe the concept</i><br>

<p>
Yes, this is the most important problem to be solved. Personally I <br>
am more interested in non-manifold possibilities; who said spacetime <br>
is continuous? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Perhaps the quantum layer will prove</i><br>

<i>&gt; computation, but there's no way for us at this point in history to</i><br>

<p>
Exactly. There might be "information horizons" in physics, levels of<br>
structure that information cannot flow well through (such as the<br>
quantum level; the strings may have their own working information<br>
systems, but cannot interact in any useful way with the emergent<br>
structures on a larger level, which cannot influence the strings<br>
since they are epiphenomena). <br>
