I agree. I once said to Bart (or maybe it was in my Extropy #12 review of<br>
the book) that I thought it unfortunate that this approach came to be called<br>
"fuzzy logic" rather than, say, many-valued logic. The word "fuzzy"<br>
sometimes seems to invite abuse of the idea.<br>

I'm having lunch with Bart Kosko tomorrow and will mention the current<br>
discussion. He's a busy busy guy, but perhaps he may read and respond to<br>
some of the messages, especially the criticism of the passage quoted.<br>
