Please don't take this personally, but I think that statements like this<br>
(especially the last sentence, which sounds _very_ threatening) are<br>
counterproductive; they  will most likely offend, scare, and further<br>
polarize the 'luddites and conservatives' against us. While some of these<br>
people are probably beyond reconsidering their views, some of them might<br>
change or moderate their views if they are tactfully interacted with.<br>

If (partially as a result of being antagonized or feeling threatened?) these<br>
people go beyond not supporting our activities and actively try to prevent<br>
transhumans  from evolving, I will certainly care about it. I plan on<br>
persuing life-extension treatments and other enhancements regardless of the<br>
obstacles, but I would prefer things to be openly available. <br>
<p>
I know that it takes a lot of effort to interact with people who appear to<br>
be devoid of rational thought without getting flustered, but I think that we<br>
should be careful to keep tactics such as ridicule and threats out of our<br>
end of the communication process. <br>
