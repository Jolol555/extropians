<i>&gt; Alright. Anyone here seen the movie Strange Days? How possible is it that we</i><br>

<i>&gt; would say a 1 minute file be? </i><br>
<p>
A rough estimate (I don't have my books nearby) of the sensory input is a<br>
a few gigabits per second. [The human visual nerve has around a million<br>
axons, firing at around 1000 Hz, and the spinal cord is on the same<br>
order]. That would give an estimate of around 10-100 gigabits for one<br>
minute storage. However, I am sure this can be decreased quite a bit, both<br>
because there are inherent correlations that can be compressed, and<br>
because other estimates give lower values (they are in the megabit range,<br>
and have support in the literature). Of this information, most would be <br>
touch and vision, with smaller amounts of auditory information and a <br>
trickle of taste, smell and other senses. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, would it be possible to go back into the</i><br>

<i>&gt; them back and reexperience them?</i><br>
<p>
Hard. Episodic memory doesn't seem to be stored in any nice, sequential <br>
manner in any particular region of the brain (although some regions are <br>
of course more important than others); it is likely that our memories are <br>
distriobuted over large parts of our neural nets, mixed with each other.<br>
<p>
Besides, we do not remember sensory information. What we remember is <br>
rather our reactions to them, our elaborations, associations and actions, <br>
not exactly what happens. Memory is actually very unreliable, and <br>
continually recreated. <br>
<p>
[Yes, I'm studying cognitive science right now. I'm planning to write an <br>
"Owners Guide to the Human Nervous System" when I get the time]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also what about the possibility of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to communicate realtime feelings or stored memories direct to another</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual with a brain-computer-brain interface?</i><br>
<p>
Feelings might be transferrable, at least the basic data of arousal, <br>
activity in the mesolimbic regions etc; if combined with higher-level <br>
means of interaction I think we could transfer quite a bit of our <br>
feelings this way. <br>
<p>
Memories are much harder, as explained above, and the same goes for<br>
cognitive structures. Language or verbalized thought might be a<br>
bottleneck, but it is easy to transfer. Our personal mental languages are<br>
so different that they would be incomprehensible (Can anybody guess what a<br>
certain scaly, golden scorpion-like fractal that the viewer flies along<br>
represents to me?). <br>
