"I think a rwandan farmer should have the same opportunity to become a nanogod <br>
as the CEO of some big company. I realize I`ve probably contradicted many <br>
extropian political opinions, but I do embrace the hope for technological <br>
advancement helping out all of humanity instead of just the rich." <br>
<p>
First off, I also am very interested in the well-being of all humans, and also <br>
hope that all humans benefit from technological advancement.  However, I don't <br>
see the selfish and greedy interests of private business as conflicting in any <br>
way with the general welfare of humanity.  In fact, I see the selfishness and <br>
greed of the business world as the driving force of technological progress, <br>
the provider of nearly all the wealth that we enjoy, and I think that selfish <br>
and greedy business people are the most likely people to actually help the <br>
poor, even though other people have much more compassion for the poor in <br>
general.<br>
<p>
First of all, a business cannot make money except by selling what people want <br>
to buy.  So, a selfish, greedy business person, who only cares about making <br>
lots of money is driven to provide the best products and most appealing <br>
services in order to make lots of money.  They are in the business of <br>
satisfying people's desires, and the ones who do it the best make the most <br>
money.  But there is a great deal of competition in business, and the <br>
businesses which are more efficient than other businesses can sell products at <br>
lower cost than their competition while receiving the same amount of profit.  <br>
Thus, they will usually tend to make more money than their competition.  Also, <br>
those which are more efficient can provide higher quality products at the same <br>
price as their competition and thus outsell them.  <br>
<p>
Greedy, selfish business people are constantly driven to outdo each other in <br>
providing higher quality, less expensive products and services.  Thus, their <br>
greed and selfishness itself drives them to help people more than their <br>
competition, to be better at providing people with what they desire (and <br>
fulfilling people's desires is the best definition of "helping people" that I <br>
know of).<br>
<p>
But to provide better products and services at lower prices requires making <br>
progress in technology, improving manufacturing methods and so forth, and this <br>
is the basic driving force behind nearly all technological progress.  Their <br>
greed drives them to develop better technologies.  Nearly all the wealth we <br>
enjoy comes from our technology.  Even the money you are willing to pay in <br>
taxes to help the poor exists because of the efforts of many greedy, selfish <br>
business people.  Without all the greedy, selfish business people, we would <br>
all be very poor indeed.  If people weren't so greedy, they wouldn't compete <br>
so fiercely and refine the quality of their products so quickly and <br>
competently.  In fact, I wish people were *greedier* and *more* selfish, in <br>
general.  If they were, they wouldn't tolerate the government taking away over <br>
half their income, we would all be making way more money, businesses wouldn't <br>
have to pay so much in taxes and could afford to lower their prices <br>
considerably (they would be driven to lower them, through competitive greed).<br>
<p>
As far as greedy, selfish business people being the ones who will bring <br>
prosperity to the poor of the world goes, remember that businesses always seek <br>
to increase their number of customers.  When the market gets too difficult to <br>
enter in rich countries, like the United States, then poorer countries will <br>
look more appealing to the greedy business people.  At first, they will use <br>
the poor people for cheap labor. And, at this point, the bleeding-hearts in <br>
America start crying, "Exploitation!"  But we must remember that the poor <br>
people wouldn't work for these businesses unless they were being paid more <br>
than they were before.  They're still in a bad position, yes, but less so than <br>
before, because they're making more money than before, and they're gaining <br>
skills.  Then, other businesses will want to sell their products to these poor <br>
people, who can now afford a little more, and now that they have more skills, <br>
other greedy business people will want to come in and offer them jobs which <br>
pay a little more than they are getting from their other jobs, so that they <br>
can attract the best workers.  So, slowly, slowly, through the efforts of <br>
greedy, selfish business people, the poor are raised from their poverty and <br>
taught how to work and how to maintain a prosperous community.  Remember the <br>
early days of the Industrial Revolution?  Remember all the poor people working <br>
in the factories and all the cries of exploitation?  Well, look at the world <br>
today.  We are much richer now than ever.  And it is because of all the <br>
greedy, selfish people that exploit us whenever they can, as mush as they can. <br>
 But to exploit us, they must provide us with something we want, and then <br>
their competitors will try to outdo them and offer us something even better, <br>
and it goes back and forth and all around until eventually everyone is very <br>
wealthy.  But we must give it time to run its course.  The poor won't become <br>
wealthy overnight, but they are becoming wealthier than they ever were before. <br>
 We are making progress, and most of our progress comes directly from the work <br>
of greedy, selfish business people.<br>
<p>
If the governments would just get out of the way and let the greedy, selfish <br>
people do their good work, the prosperity would be spread around much faster.  <br>
Coercive, meddling governments are slowing down progress and the advancement <br>
of prosperity considerably, and they are the biggest enemies of poor people <br>
everywhere.<br>
<p>
A lot of the reason people are against greedy, selfish people is because they <br>
imagine that there is only a limited amount of wealth to go around, so if the <br>
greedy people take more, there is less left for everyone else.  Considering <br>
that nearly all the wealth we enjoy now was not around a few million years <br>
ago, or even a few hundered years ago, this view is patently absurd.  Wealth <br>
is constantly being created, and most of it is being created by greedy, <br>
selfish people, and that creation of wealth benefits us all.<br>
<p>
Another point to make is that while greed and selfishness are extremely good <br>
qualities for a business person to have, they are extremely dangerous <br>
qualities for anyone involved in the government to have.  This is because <br>
business people _make_ money through voluntary transaction (if they don't do <br>
it voluntarily, I don't consider them business people, I consider them <br>
thieves), while the government _gets_ its money by forcefully taking it from <br>
people.  Thus, greedy politicians will cause even more money to be taken from <br>
people and cause tyranny to grow while greedy business people will create more <br>
wealth and cause prosperity and abundance to spread to everyone.  <br>
