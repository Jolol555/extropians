Well, I don't doubt my own existence. What I doubt it identity in the <br>
common usage of the term - some inner core that is forever unchanged. <br>

Well, my philosophy is still somewhat fuzzy - I know what I mean, but I have<br>
so far not formalized my views. I think we are biased to place strict binary<br>
limits of 'me' and 'not-me' where there shouldn't be any - where do you end?<br>
Beyond your brain? Beyond your skin? Beyond your clothes? Beyond your<br>
personal space? Beyond your social interactions? As I see it, there is no<br>
black and white limit, just a gradual decrease of selfness. And this selfness<br>
can change greatly. There is no fixed 'me', just a bundle of causally<br>
interconnected events that share some common qualities. <br>
<p>
When I use the word 'I', I refer to this bundle. And since I prefer to <br>
look at its dynamic structure rather than its constituents (which are <br>
always flowing through it: ideas, atoms, energy...), I fully subscribe to <br>
the slogan "I am a verb":<br>
<p>
I am not an individual.<br>
An atom with a shining gnostic nucleus.<br>
I am a wind, a verb, a process<br>
That evolves and changes by my own rules.<br>
