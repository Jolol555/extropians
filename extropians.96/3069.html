Since we have lots of experts on the list, a question: stratospheric <br>
baloons fly pretty high, 30-40 km. Assuming a 1 ton baloon payload <br>
(which <br>
sure defines a gigantic hydrogen baloon), which drags a solid (Al, <br>
ammonia <br>
perchlorate, resin) booster, made from light compound with a very small <br>
<p>
payload (50 kg?), let's say 20 km high up, then igniting the booster to <br>
<p>
travel the rest of the way to LEO.<br>
Does this make sense, weight-wise? What are pros, what are cons?<br>

===============================================<br>
[[I did a study design on this about 20 years ago, using a two-stage<br>
hybrid (read cheap) (solid hydrocarbon, LOX) on a high altitude <br>
balloon.<br>
The specific impulse is much better than an all-solid.<br>
The all up mass (less balloon) was on the order of 500 Kg, payload<br>
on the order of 5 Kg.<br>
I did use a hydrogen balloon, BTW.<br>
The number one advantage is the reduction of atmospheric drag, <br>
permitting<br>
an open air, spherical tankage design and the attendant structural <br>
mass reduction. The chamber pressure also does not have to be run<br>
up to the bleeding edge, saving a lot of pump mass and such.<br>
The nozzles can be fixed, high expansion bells. If I remember, my<br>
second stage nozzle was an ablator nearly the volume of the LOX tank.<br>
<p>
The “free” altitude is of secondary interest.<br>
<p>
The launch coordinates are hard to control, and the platform is a long <br>
way <br>
from a service facility. The balloon is hard to recover. The all-up <br>
mass<br>
is quite limited, unless one develops a giant (reuseable?) balloon <br>
array<br>
thing.<br>
<p>
All in all, a reasonable proposition, and I think I’ve heard of similar<br>
proposals. Whether it can compete with subsonic aircraft launchers<br>
like the Pegasus is doubtful.<br>
