Lunar advertising: doesn't this happen in Heinlein's "Man who Sold the Moon"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; What are the physics behind sci-fi force fields? Are there any or is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; purely fantasy? Perhaps only nano force fields are possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Check out the Langstrom Field; Pournelle and Niven probably have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; equations stashed somewhere.  My understanding was that it was supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be a plausible force-field requiring only a few new discoveries.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "Building the Mote in God's Eye", Niven and Pournelle, in</i><br>
_AStep Further Out_, Jerry Pournelle: "[The Alderson Drive and the <br>
Langston Field] were invented to Jerry Pournelle's specifications by<br>
Dan Alderson ... at Cal Tech's Jet Propulsion Laboratories." So Alderson's<br>
the person to contact, but unfortunately he's dead. Jerry Pournelle should<br>
still be out there at jerryp@bix.com.  (Alderson also invented the<br>
Alderson Disc:  "A massive disc the size of a planetary system, with a small<br>
hole in the centre through which a star bobs up and down" - quoting<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/3699/sf-megastructures.html">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/3699/sf-megastructures.html</a>.)<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A memetic modelling tool could have some very interesting applications.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "good" modelling/engineering tool was designed, couldn't this give small</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations enormously disproportionate amounts of influence?</i><br>
<p>
See _In the Country of the Blind_, Michael Flynn. (In ths story, the small<br>
organization in question dates from the Victorian era, when they used <br>
Babbage's mechanical computers to make their extrapolations, and has<br>
survived into the present day.)<br>
