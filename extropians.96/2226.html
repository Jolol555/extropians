How true.  This brings up the theory that art is dead as presented by<br>
supporters of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadists, Italian Futurists as well as<br>
Actionists.  _Art is not dead._  Art has simply changed - mutated.  The<br>
necessity for "objects of art" is outdated.  As presented by Allan Kaprow<br>
(primary Happening artist and author of _The Blurring of Art and Life_), art<br>
is everywhere.  As presented by Conceptualists, art is thinking. The<br>
historical concept of art has changed.  Modern art has changed.  We are in<br>
the era of electronics and computers and virtual realities.  Our beings have<br>
changed.  We are no longer humans.  Our sense of self has become more<br>
refined, just as our emotions are becoming more refined.  We can embrace<br>
objects of art, or not.  Our choice.  The point is, there is a choice.<br>

<i>&gt;(snip) ... classification scheme of 'artists' vs. </i><br>
<i>&gt;'engineers'.</i><br>
<p>
This is another example of outdated classifications and stiffling art.  I'm<br>
currently reading _Iterations: The New Image_.  It is a collection of essays<br>
by artists who are also engineers, and a series of images which portray<br>
interactive computer generated designs as well as installations.  <br>
<p>
Also, a good book to read is _Art &amp; Other Serious Matters_ by Harold<br>
Rosenberg which grasps the cultural influences on the field of art<br>
criticism.  The last chapter is "Art is a Special Way of Thinking."<br>
<p>
In that art communicates knowledge, why not an engineer.<br>
