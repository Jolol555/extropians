So to hell with them?  I suppose that if crack is cheap so the people<br>
involved with it only destroy each other, we don't care that the reason<br>
they do so is that they were abused as children (say).  It seems to me<br>
that every spirit broken by abuse (with all the attendant psychological<br>
and drug-related problems) is a victory for entropy.  It also seems to me<br>
that looking for ways to heal those spirits so people can stand on their<br>
own two feet (as it were) instead of using drugs as a crutch is a more<br>
constructive endeavor for Extropians than circling the wagons or running<br>
people down for behaving weakly or foolishly.<br>
