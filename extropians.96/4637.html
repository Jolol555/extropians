Since <br>

myself <br>

50+ <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  messages, of which I read maybe two. The bulk of communication on the list</i><br>
<p>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I must unfortunately unsubscribe. (Like anyone will miss a turbo-lurker</i><br>
like <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  myself) I fully intend to check out the ExI web site and archives on a </i><br>
<i>&gt; regular </i><br>
<i>&gt;  basis, and to subscribe to Extropy. I hope these will prove as stimulating</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as </i><br>
<i>&gt;  this list was in its heyday.</i><br>
<p>
Hang tight.  As Max mentioned the other day, the perennial question of "list<br>
quality" is about to be addressed in a big way with some very interesting new<br>
ideas and initiatives by the Extropy Institute.  Any delay is due only to the<br>
desire to make the Institute's next steps _quality_ moves that really improve<br>
the group's "on-line life".<br>
