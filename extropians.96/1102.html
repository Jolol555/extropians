I don't know what brought down TWA Flight 800.  It seems unlikely it was a<br>
Navy missile.  But what is even more unlikely is that hundreds of people --<br>
starting with the entire crew of a Navy destroyer and extending all the way<br>
up to the President -- would participate in a cover-up.<br>
<p>
Are you suggesting the Navy intentionally downed a passenger airliner?  Or<br>
are you suggesting one individual pushed the wrong button at the wrong<br>
time, and now hundreds of people in multiple organizations (including<br>
absolutely everyone involved in the investigation) are desperately trying<br>
to conceal the truth?<br>
<p>
Sorry, I'm not ready to junk *all other* theories -- especially when this<br>
theory is largely based on information provided by "anonymous" sources.<br>
