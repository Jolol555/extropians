This is a good question. Just having everything float around as one glop <br>
is a sure recipe for unexpected chemical reactions (= inefficiencies). <br>
The recycling system is also interesting, maybe it  could work like this:<br>
<p>
Pipes, coated with macro- and microscopic cilia pump the waste forward (in<br>
zero gravity we need pumping to move the waste). Some specialized<br>
disassemblers are injected, and start to break apart the waste into more and<br>
more basic sludge as it moves through long, winding pipes (yes, it is a<br>
gut!). Through the walls the system extracts basic chemicals and add new<br>
disassemblers for each stage. At the end we have the unmanageable stuff that<br>
can be dealt with using heavy-duty disassemblers or dumped.  Around the<br>
winding "gut" we place a set of circulatory systems that take care of<br>
different chemicals (water, organics, metals, nanites) and pump them to their<br>
correct destinations. <br>

<p>
This depends on what materials the assemblers use. If they use prefabricated<br>
nanite parts, they would need stockpiles of them (and they are probably<br>
inert), but for general building we need inert, fairly general chemicals. My<br>
guess is that we might stockpile amino acids, the basic vitamins and<br>
co-factors, and common structures like the fatty acid or steroid backbone and<br>
ions in crystals. I imagine a cubical block of diamond filled with tiny<br>
compartments holding a chemical each, linked by quick molecular conveyor<br>
belts. <br>
