The following insightful statement was recentlyt re-posted by Eric Watt Forste:<br>
<p>
<p>
"I used to put up a lot of resistance to the idea of being a<br>
professional software engineer because it seemed so cold and<br>
abstract. But as the demands of the market and my own desire for<br>
income combined to draw me into that profession like a tractor<br>
beam, I found that creating software or modifying existing software<br>
really does feel much like writing poetry or sculpting (or, as is<br>
unfortunately most often the case, like editing someone else's<br>
poetry or modifying someone else's sculpture). The audience is a<br>
bit limited because the only people who get to really appreciate<br>
the work of most software engineers is other software engineers...<br>
the exception to this last rule is the user-interface engineers,<br>
and I suspect that that's one reason why that is such a popular<br>
line of work within software engineering."<br>
