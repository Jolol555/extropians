In reply to my statement, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Encrypting messages is like painting your windows black:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; it just attracts attention.   </i><br>
<p>
Eugene Leitl writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is the reason why PGP advocates suggest to encrypt the entire </i><br>
<i>&gt; email traffic (I would even suggest making some speedy, unsafe </i><br>
<i>&gt; encryption (e.g. XORing plain with CAM-generated pseudorandom </i><br>
<i>&gt; stream) a part of TCP/IP protocol suite): </i><br>
<p>
The NSA would love this.  It would give everybody a false sense of <br>
security.  An encrypted file generated by a speedy, unsafe encryption <br>
program would differ from a file generated by better encryption <br>
programs.  The difference wouldn't be apparent to a casual observer, <br>
but the NSA could see the difference.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; so that high-entropy pieces (compressed stuff causes this anyway) </i><br>
<i>&gt; won't cause scanner chips raise their virtual eyebrows whence </i><br>
<i>&gt; flowing thru NSA (heard the interrupt pling?) nodes </i><br>
<p>
True, they would have to rely on other methods besides scanner chips <br>
that simply recognize high-entropy messages.  But other methods are <br>
available.  Devising such methods would give them something to do, <br>
maybe increase their budget...  no problem.  <br>
<p>
In a sea of pseudorandom bits generated by a simple encryption <br>
program, a "seriously" encrypted message would stand out.  Then <br>
they would know:  here is somebody who has something to hide.  <br>
The standard encryption isn't good enough for this guy -- so who is he?  <br>
And then they would proceed to find out who he is.  <br>
<p>
Let me rephrase my original statement:  using more encryption than <br>
other people commonly use is like painting your windows black when <br>
everybody else uses curtains.  It just attracts attention.  <br>
