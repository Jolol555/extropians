<i>&gt; "semantic intelligence precludes social intelligence" in areas where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge is becoming widespread (like in parts of the computer industry)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and an increase in areas where new cadres of experts are developing, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well as a time-correlation between technologisation and the spread of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; belief in different nations. Any data on this? Perhaps checking popular</i><br>

How about examining the degree to which people revile certain<br>
professions? Car salesmen, lawyers, bankers, hackers, etc seem to the<br>
average person to have "secret knowledge" which they then use to take<br>
advantage of others. Plumbing alone mystifies many people, as well as<br>
draining their wallets. Possibly a historical example of memetic<br>
synergies would by the anti-semitism of Nazi Germany. There you had a<br>
populaly percieved notion that because Jews respected scholarship, they<br>
occupied a large percentage of the positions of economic and social<br>
leadership. Due to the hyperinflationary stress of living in Germany in<br>
the 20s and 30s, there was obviously a huge level of economic<br>
apprehension. if you tie these two memes together, plus the historical<br>
Christian bias against Jews, you get the Third Reich.<br>
<p>
WHile that movement was focused on bankers, think about the level of<br>
memetic hysteria towards lawyers today. What sort of additional memes<br>
would synergize with the current dissatisfaction with government and<br>
lawyers to the point that we could actually see a true movement to hang<br>
the lawyers? Of course you have a natural mechanism of negative<br>
feedback: to outlaw lawyers you need to pass laws, which takes lawyers,<br>
so this would be a difficult profession to get up in arms against.<br>
Anyways, most people understand how laws work, as they've been on one<br>
end or the other of at least a few laws in their lives.<br>
<p>
Using this, think of the building luddism in our society. What sort of<br>
memes would help synergize their memes, and what ones will act as<br>
negative feedback?<br>
