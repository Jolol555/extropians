IAN: The use of hallucinogenic agents is observed to be<br>
central to almost all primitive "religious" organization.<br>
However much we might like to trash religion,  I don't<br>
think any objective observer could honestly dispute its<br>
central formative role in, and expression of, the evolu-<br>
tion of human intelligence from pre-human conditions.<br>
The same goes for "rock paintings."<br>
IAN:<br>
<i>&gt;How many nonhumans have religions? How many nonhumans</i><br>
paint coherent images? None that I'm aware of.  As you<br>
concede that hallucinogens may have promoted their aris-<br>
ing, it seems that you must also concede that the hallu-<br>
cinogenic theory of the arising of human intelligence, <br>
specifically of those feature that mark its arising, <br>
correlates strongly with the physical evidence.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Good point! ...you may be onto something here.<br>
[I was making a joke  (have you ever tried to talk to someone on acid and<br>
have an intelligent conversation?) But then, I know, I always forget....you<br>
have to put a smiley face or we wont know its not 100% seriousity...]<br>
<p>
I don't know if prehistoric man ate acid, I dont really care ; - )<br>
<p>
But in essence (with or without mushrooms) you are talking about something<br>
quite important, more specifically *patterns and visualizations* and a keen<br>
observation about the intelligence of humans - being that (primarily) through<br>
the vision part of the brain, we have developed pattern recognitions that<br>
other species do not. <br>
How this will shape up in the debate about and developement of cognitive<br>
science and intelligence research  I am not qualified to say. <br>
But it is certain that our eyes and mind and imagination (mind's eye) all<br>
work together in a very different and cohesive way to make us what one would<br>
call "sentient".<br>
