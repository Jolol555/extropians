In that case I would say that the old list subscription scheme worked -- I<br>
was still skipping half the messages, but because they were so technical<br>
that I didn't have enough time to read up on the background, not because<br>
they were "low-quality". <br>

I think this was the biggest problem -- the old list was very unreliable,<br>
and while I'll forgive that on a free list it's really unacceptable when<br>
I'm paying for it. This is the same reason why I give away my software and<br>
don't charge for any of my Web pages (e.g. the car ads). I don't have to<br>
be so concerned about reliability if it's free.<br>
<p>
The other problem, of course, is paying for it. Foreign users have a hard<br>
time paying small dollar amounts by check, and sending credit card numbers<br>
over the Net is still potentially dangerous. <br>
