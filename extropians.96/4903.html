<i>&gt;One model of memetic engineering, focusing specifically on </i><br>
<i>&gt;propogation, goes under the informal name of "activism".  I </i><br>
<i>&gt;introduced the topic of memetics amongst a group of organizers last </i><br>
<i>&gt;summer, and they enthusiastically adopted it as a way of explaining </i><br>
<i>&gt;what they do (one of the few times I have successfully connected </i><br>
<i>&gt;progressives to a transhumanist subject!).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To mount a successful meme propogation campaign takes advance planning </i><br>
<i>&gt;and tactical knowledge.  This is rarely attempted by an individual;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;usually a team is set up based on individual expertise and training.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Having a central visionary is also helpful--someone who where the </i><br>
<i>&gt;campaign fits into a movement overall, someone who connects well to </i><br>
<i>&gt;other people through an understanding of their hopes and fears.</i><br>

I may be looking at this in a more abstract sense.  Consider the world as a<br>
chaotic system.  In chaotic systems, subtle exertions of influence can have<br>
far ranging impacts that scale far beyond the initial triggers.  There are<br>
many heuristics for why this happens in societies and how to propagate<br>
memes, but no concrete models.  In this case it may be a matter of<br>
complexity more than anything.  Truly understanding the why and how of<br>
memetic propagation would be akin to truly understanding all aspects of<br>
human behavior and possibly cognitive psychology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One of the major reference books in the area is _Organizing for Social </i><br>
<i>&gt;Change_ by Kim Bobo, Jackie Kendall and Steve Max of Midwest Academy.  </i><br>
<p>
Thanks for the reference.  I will check it out and see what information I<br>
can glean from it.  Studying the historical propagation of religions might<br>
also give me some clues to the reasons for memetic susceptibility.<br>
