Referring to the typical Christian, I said,<br>
<p>
"Their blatant dogmatism is evidence that they don't seek the truth,"<br>
<p>
Stephen de Vries replied,<br>
<p>
"No.  It is evidence that they don`t seek your truth.  From what I`ve heard <br>
from many christians is that they have found, and are very happy with, "the" <br>
truth."<br>
<p>
	I suppose I should clarify what I mean by "the truth" and what I mean by <br>
"seeking the truth."  "The truth" is the way things actually are.  "My truth" <br>
is the way things actually are for me.  "Your truth" is the way things <br>
actually are, for you.  "Seeking the truth" is to actively search for a more <br>
accurate perception and understanding of how things actually are, constantly <br>
refining one's own observational and rational abilities, so that the way <br>
things actually are can be perceived and understoond with greater clarity.<br>
	Thus, I maintain that most people, including Christians, do not seek the <br>
truth, whether that be my truth or their own truths.  Yes, they may have found <br>
a way of thinking and living that makes them happy, and they may call that <br>
"the truth", but I think it would more accurately be called "a good way of <br>
thinking and living", and not "the truth".<br>
	I repeat, to "seek the truth" is to be actively engaged in increasing one's <br>
own observational abilities (which include increasing sensory acuity and <br>
personal bandwidth), and increasing one's reasoning abilities.  It's about <br>
developing an increasingly accurate understanding of the way things are.  <br>
	Yes, we each have our own viewpoint, our own set of data to analyze, and <br>
thus, each individual would seek a different truth (if they seek at all).  <br>
However, I think it is valid to say that someone is not "seeking the truth" if <br>
they are not actively working on clarifying their perception and understanding <br>
of the data and thinking that is their personal world.  I also think that most <br>
people, including Christians, are NOT actively engaged in this process of <br>
"seeking the truth."<br>
	By saying, "most people do not seek the truth," I am not necessarily implying <br>
that these people are bad people or anything like that.  I intend it to have <br>
the same sort of connotation as saying, "most people are not auto mechanics."  <br>
I'm simply stating a fact about what sort of activities they don't engage in.  <br>
Someone who does not really work on automobiles but likes to think of <br>
theirself as an auto mechanic may be offended by being told that they are not <br>
really an auto mechanic, and likewise, people who aren't really engaged in <br>
improving the quality of their perception and understanding of their world but <br>
like to think of themselves as truth-seekers may be offended by being told <br>
that they really aren't seekers of the truth.  But their offense does not <br>
change the nature of their activities.<br>
