Sounds like a fine idea, but I used no sophistry. When you claim to have a  <br>
solution to the deepest problem in Philosophy you should be prepared to  <br>
defend it vigorously, have answers to difficult questions, and not just <br>
expect everyone to automatically call you a genius.<br>

                <br>
That won't do, how does it work?<br>

                <br>
<p>
In other words one is a subset of the other and there is no fundamental  <br>
difference. In an earlier post I wrote  " When I say that A caused B, I mean  <br>
that if I place the events observable from my frame of reference in a <br>
sequence  ordered according to time, and I find event A in the sequence, <br>
then I will always find event B at some later point in the sequence, and <br>
that's all I  mean".  <br>
<p>
That would seem to easily cover both of you cases. To repeat for the third <br>
time, what's the difference between cognitive and computational causality?<br>
                <br>

                <br>

I think you're telling me far more than you know.<br>
