<p>
<i>&gt; Such photos are in existence, and can be accessed in the US Army</i><br>
<i>&gt; archives, probably at your local National Archives.  </i><br>
<p>
Ok, I'll check that out.  Have you been to the archives yourself?  <br>
If not, what is the basis for this statement?  <br>
<p>
I am assuming that Michael Shermer gave us his best shot.  If such <br>
photos are in existence, why didn't he publish them in his article?  <br>
I have read numerous books on this subject and never seen any <br>
photographs of the gassing operation itself.  There are photos of <br>
everything else, but not that.  If they do in fact exist, then, as I said, <br>
revisionism becomes impossible.  That would settle the matter <br>
once and for all.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;: Revisionism is possible only because there is a total lack of physical,</i><br>
<i>&gt;: photographic, or documentary evidence for gas chambers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a total lie Lyle. </i><br>
<p>
Of course I expected to get this sort of thing... but I didn't expect <br>
to get it from you, Mike.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The camps are still in existence, </i><br>
<p>
Of course they are.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; though they are beginning to fall apart from age. Just because you </i><br>
<i>&gt; personally have never been there is no reason to doubt their existence, </i><br>
<p>
I don't doubt their existence.  My dad was in the US Army in WW2.  <br>
He was in the unit that liberated Dachau. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and anyone who has told you they do not exist is either misled </i><br>
<i>&gt; or a liar. </i><br>
<p>
No one has told me any such thing.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would suggest that anyone who doubts to go, </i><br>
<p>
I intend to go.  In the meantime I have to rely on photographs.  <br>
But please try to understand:  it's not the existence of the camps <br>
that I doubt.  I only doubt that the camps had gas chambers.  <br>
<p>
In the photographs I have seen, the rooms which are supposed to <br>
have been gas chambers don't look like gas chambers.  The alleged <br>
gas chamber at Auschwitz is a concrete room with a doorway (not a <br>
door that could be closed, locked, or sealed) opening into the <br>
adjacent room with the ovens.  It looks like a morgue.  I don't see <br>
how it could possibly have been used as a gas chamber.  <br>
<p>
If an archeologist examined the camps, not knowing what they were, <br>
it would never cross his mind that the rooms in question were <br>
gas chambers.  To repeat what I said last night:  if there were rooms <br>
in the ruins of Auschwitz that looked like the gas chambers in <br>
American prisons, revisionism would be impossible.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as your own eyes will not lie.  </i><br>
<p>
Sometimes people see what they want to see.  Some people can <br>
look at the same photographs I look at, and see gas chambers.  Being a <br>
creedal minimalist helps to keep this phenomenon under control.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In our social studies class in junior high our teacher showed us films </i><br>
<i>&gt; produced by the US Army at the end of the war of the camps. </i><br>
<i>&gt; THey definitely showed gas chambers, and showed the gas apparatus. </i><br>
<i>&gt; They also interviewed people who were prisoners at the camps who </i><br>
<i>&gt; had been put on details to clean out the gas chambers after use.  </i><br>
<p>
I'll check that out too.  There is of course a remote possibility <br>
that the US Army had its own agenda, and was more concerned with <br>
propaganda than with veracity.  Likewise for your social studies <br>
teacher.  Nevertheless, I will check out all leads.  <br>
<p>
I started working on this subject in the summer of 1995.  By December, <br>
I had written a 50 page critique of "Proving the Holocaust," in which I <br>
went over every facet of Shermer's article in the same vein as my post <br>
last night.  At the end of my article, I proposed a project, called the <br>
Gas Chamber Project, in which I would recruit 50 college students, <br>
and they would each write a thesis; the thesis topics would be chosen <br>
in such a way that, taken together, they would cover the whole subject.  <br>
My intention was to check out all leads, get all the evidence on the <br>
table, and settle the matter once and for all.  By that time, however <br>
(end of 95), I was sick and tired of the whole thing, and I put it aside.  <br>
But I still intend to pursue the project.  The idea is not to prove that <br>
gas chambers existed, nor to prove that they didn't exist, but to find out <br>
what happened.  <br>
