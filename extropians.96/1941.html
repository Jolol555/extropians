I just love arguments (as this isn't much of a debate) on the relative<br>
merits of socialism and capitalism. Recently I've tended to be more<br>
"socialist" in that I have misgivings on how capitalism and the free<br>
market work. My main problem is with money and it's social effects. I<br>
do believe money is a pretty good invention, but I think it's possible<br>
to do better with alternative socio-economic systems. No, I don't have<br>
a replacement though I think any replacement will have to occur at the<br>
community level.<br>
<p>
As for the argument:<br>

Personally I believe people are generally selfish. Not a bad thing,<br>
but when most people's lives revolve around money and the gathering of<br>
things money can buy, not to mention the consumer culture we've<br>
created, then I think most communes will fail.<br>
<p>
I'm slowly working on what I call my "complex". I figure I'd be most<br>
happy in an environment where I can do a wide variety of work<br>
(software, hardware, biotech, etc.) without a lot of requirements for<br>
monetary gain. I'm hoping that the only money I'll require once the<br>
complex is "complete" is to pay property taxes. I also need other<br>
people involved, not only because being holed up by myself could get<br>
pretty dull, but also having a wide variety of people involved in the<br>
project will be the only way it'll get completed.<br>
<p>
I expect there'll be some sort of socialism in place, though I won't<br>
call it a commune. I don't expect a money based system internally. It<br>
will probably be a corporation for legal purposes. Contracts will<br>
likely form the bulk of arrangements with people involved. I expect<br>
there will be a limited form of democracy for high-level things, maybe<br>
a voted board of directors. These things are to work out. One thing<br>
that I think will be necessary are a good set of written goals, short<br>
term to long term. I do believe most communes fail because of a lack<br>
of focus of the participants, and a bit too much freedom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hmm, maybe. Co-ops don't work well on a large scale, unlike cults</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Cooperative farming is not illegal in the U.S., but it does not</i><br>

<p>
I don't know what to make of this statement. If the intent was to blow<br>
out the competition, then I guess they failed. If the intent was to<br>
produce quality goods while supporting the people involved, then who<br>
knows? And don't US farmers get substantial government subsidies<br>
still? Perhaps it's not a level playing field. I don't know enough<br>
about the US agricultural industry to comment too much.<br>
