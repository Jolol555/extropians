<p>
Yes.  I didn't put this other step on the list because I don't know of<br>
a good neutral name for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On earth life seems to have started as soon as it possibly could, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;soon as the planet cooled enough to allow liquid water. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure we know that.  There was a billion years (a long time<br>
really) between the time the Earth formed and the oldest known life<br>
fossils.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Having got to this stage it was not easy to leave it, life stayed</i><br>
<i>&gt;stuck here for over 2 billion years.</i><br>
<p>
Only 1.7 billion years, actually.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;About stage 3: It must be hard to make a multicellular life form that is good </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough to compete with single cell life, it took a long time to figure out </i><br>
<i>&gt;how to do it. Live was stuck here for about 700 million years.</i><br>
 <br>
For Great Filter issues, "hard" would be expected times of a trillion<br>
years or more.  An expected times 700my is far from hard enough to matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;sense would indicate that a large brain must come first because a hand is of </i><br>
<i>&gt;no use if you don't have a big brain to direct it, but common sense is wrong </i><br>
<p>
Good point.  List has been changed accordingly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;About stage 6: If we ever get out of this stage we'll do it in less than a </i><br>
<i>&gt;thousand years, probably a lot less. It appears that each stage is shorter </i><br>
<i>&gt;than the one before.</i><br>
<p>
This is likely to be a New Yorker's view of the world phenomena.   The<br>
really hard stages, I think, do not cluster near us in time.<br>
