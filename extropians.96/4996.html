Surely, a Power will be slightly more complicated than a human being. <br>
Surely, because of the complexity/robustness necessary a Power will need <br>
nonalgorithmic control. If yes, then the whole concept of "hardwired <br>
behaviour" is meaningless. Imagine you could control a human: if a threat <br>
is detected you could disrupt his motorics, so that he is frozen <br>
immobile. But how does one detect a threat? There are zillion <br>
possiblities how a human being might kill another one with dire violence, <br>
and even more of them how it could be done with cunning. To catch them <br>
all, the filter must become arbitrarily complicated, nay, even sentient. <br>
Clearly, such a filter should become unreliable?<br>
