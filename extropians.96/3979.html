<p>
What do you mean by "designed logically"?<br>
<p>
Are you conflating evolution with logical design?<br>
<p>
On this point, I agree with what Sir Julian Huxley wrote:<br>
"The purpose manifested in evolution is only an apparent purpose. It is as<br>
much a product of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the<br>
ebb and flow of the tides. It is we who have read purpose into evolution,<br>
as earlier<br>
men projected will and emotion into inorganic phenomena like storm or<br>
earthquake. If we wish to work towards a purpose for the future of man, we<br>
must formulate that purpose ourselves. Purposes in life are made, not found<br>
... "<br>
<p>
"People who brandish naturalistic principles at us are usually up to<br>
mischief", warns biologist Sir Peter Medawar, in _The Future Of Man_. He<br>
points out the danger of using "naturalistic" or biological arguments to<br>
attempt to set<br>
up values:<br>
<p>
"...Our policies and intentions are not to be based upon the supposition<br>
that Nature knows best; that we are at the mercy of natural laws, and flout<br>
them at our peril. It is a profound truth ... that Nature does not know<br>
best; that<br>
genetical evolution, if we choose to look at it liverishly instead of with<br>
fatuous good humor, is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and<br>
blunder."<br>
