<i>&gt;Imagine future warfare where each human soldier control a flock of robots,</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibly by telepresence, and he with the best and most robots wins the</i><br>
<i>&gt;battle. I think this is the most likely way for future warfare to go. Off</i><br>
<i>&gt;course there will always be weapons that uses the battleaxe style instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the scalpel style that robotic warfare represents.</i><br>
<i>&gt;just look at it from a PR and political viewpoint. A Robowar will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;relatively inexpensive(none of our boys got lost) and hi tech war material</i><br>
<i>&gt;is always cool on the tube.</i><br>
<p>
Mach 17 autonomous fighter aircraft instructed via telepresence. Cool!<br>
Looks like war may be turning into more of a technological competition than<br>
tragedy.<br>
When the US have those little peacekeeping wars, even the Gulf War with<br>
Iraq it was merely a way for the country to go over there and play with<br>
their cool new toys.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem with rail guns is not the size of the rail. You can build</i><br>
<i>&gt;one the size of a pistol to give equivalent muzzle velocity. The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;is in the power supply. TO give sufficient gauss, with current capacitor</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology, you would need a backpack full to get enough power for a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;blasts, plus a power supply to "reload".</i><br>
<p>
So I guess that explains why in "Snow Crash" they had a mini fission<br>
reactor cell attached to the gun. hehe<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;THe US DOD now owns the designs......  ;-)</i><br>
<p>
Damn that sucks.<br>
