<i>&gt; Such an exercise might make an interesting document.  Pick a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of propositions; find pro and con advocates; let the advocates</i><br>
<i>&gt; draft opening arguments, look at and criticize each others, redraft</i><br>
<i>&gt; them, refine the proposition as necessary, question each other and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the others' evidence, re-examine the answers and follow up, take</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions from a panel of observers chosen adversarially, and let</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of this happen at the level of "discovery" ... &lt;snip&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Ok.  I propose a science court debate about the proposition <br>
"There were gas chambers at Auschwitz and Birkenau."  <br>
The prosecution says there were, the defense says the prosecution's <br>
arguments prove nothing.  I will argue for the defense.  <br>
<p>
Most people would say this debate is too one-sided to be interesting.  <br>
That's what I thought, until I started looking into it.  Last year I spent <br>
several months investigating this question.  My point of departure was <br>
"Proving the Holocaust," by Michael Shermer, which appeared in <br>
Skeptic magazine, volume 2, number 4 (the "pseudohistory" issue).  <br>
I sent Michael Shermer a copy of my conclusions, and he offered to <br>
debate me.  <br>
<p>
To anyone who is new to this subject, I would suggest the following: <br>
<p>
1.  Read Michael Shermer's article, and look for ad hominem <br>
arguments, non sequiturs, and other fallacies.  Consider the *form* of <br>
his argument.  <br>
<p>
2.  Read *Auschwitz, A Doctor's Eyewitness Account,* by Dr. Miklos <br>
Nyiszli.  Dr. Nyiszli is one of the prosecution's best witnesses.  <br>
Before reading the book, look at maps of the camps (available in many <br>
sources).  Auschwitz had one crematorium, Birkenau had four.  <br>
Obviously, anyone who was there would know this.  As you read the <br>
book, ask yourself if it could possibly have been written by someone <br>
who was there.  <br>
<p>
This should at least convince you that there is something to argue <br>
about.  <br>
<p>
