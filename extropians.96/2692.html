&lt;Vinge's flaw is the Zones.  The key difference (to me) is that the Zones <br>
aren't meant to enhance anything.  They're meant as an explicit gimmick to <br>
allow the existence of normal humans to perceive the glory of the Powers.&gt;<br>
<p>
Wow! I found alot more to the Zones in _A Fire Upon the Deep_ than that! <br>
 They represent (to me) the various levels at which processes can operate <br>
in this reality.  The Powers may exhult in the Transcend of the Contest <br>
level, but they must still sense through the Context level of the Beyond, <br>
and even descend to the Unthinking Depths of the Content level to let <br>
gravity do the dirty work of actually effecting change in the physical <br>
world.  (The Zones, in a somewhat more than metaphoric way, may also have <br>
some basis in cosmology, IMVHO, though I won't get into that here.)<br>
<p>
The moral of the Tines' world and the Slow Zone human Pham infected by Old <br>
One is that Powers can't do much at our level (though they probably have <br>
little interest in our level most of the time) without our help.  In the <br>
end, the Powers are reduced to operating through 'mere' human forms and <br>
some 'magnetic slime mold' (the Countermeasure - a more serious 'mystical' <br>
crutch, BTW, than FTL travel) in order to stop the Blight.<br>
<p>
Is the infected human Pham really just "His [Old One's] robot at the Bottom <br>
of the Beyond." 'No!" says Ravna, "you're human, and we're just working for <br>
the same things."<br>
<p>
These "same things" are the Patterns that Powers may play with at the Top, <br>
advanced races may trade in at the Middle, but only certified, <br>
uncontrolable primitives like humans (see experimental evidence from <br>
Hanse), can actually implement at the Bottom.<br>
<p>
At the risk of appearing Deathist, I might even suggest that it is <br>
primarily the threat of death that inspires humans to master the magic of <br>
self transformation.  Without this capability (ST), be we Power, Blight or <br>
Flenser, we are all Godscatter in the end.<br>

"This thing is a devil," Manuel said. "And this is the figure I desired to <br>
make, this is the child of my long dreams and labors. This is the creature <br>
I designed to be more admirable and significant than the drab men I found <br>
in streets and lanes and palaces! Certainly, I have loosed among mankind a <br>
blighting misery which I cannot control at all."  -- Dom Manuel the <br>
Redeemer, in James Branch Cabell's _Figures of Earth_ (1st printing 1921, <br>
latest printing (?) 1969 Ballantine Books)<br>
