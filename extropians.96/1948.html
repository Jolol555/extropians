This is the main altruistic idea of socialism.  It is why the USSR fell.  The<br>
more socialistic the government, the more they have populations starving<br>
(except the government officials of course).  Everyone else in a socialistic<br>
system is equally poor. I call it "Egalitarian Liberalism"<br>
<p>
Some of the "masses" (i.e. citizens) are "fooled" and don't realize what<br>
happened.  That is why those governments need censorship.  They need to keep<br>
"fooling" the population.  If the truth gets out, there is trouble:  People<br>
realize they are being "ripped off" and their work is being given to lazy<br>
beggars while their own family starves.<br>
