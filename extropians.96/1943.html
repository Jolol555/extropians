I'm sort of just popping into this thread -- I haven't really been<br>
following it that closely. Here are my thoughts:<br>

<p>
Possibly in one-on-one interactions, but not from my experience in<br>
business. Maybe it's just Vancouver, but it's incredible how many<br>
businesses I've had to deal with that don't like win-win deals: "Okay,<br>
you build a complete system, then we'll give you some money for it,<br>
and we'll own it!" or "I know our company is going to go bankrupt<br>
without some changes, but we can't afford to pay to save the company."<br>
or "Gee, that's a good idea Oliver. Why don't you implement QA<br>
department. How about by next Friday. Oh and you've still got that<br>
deadline on Wednesday. And no we can't pay you what you're worth."<br>
<p>
(that last one reminds me of Dilbert...)<br>

<p>
Assuming we don't have a major disease (super-plague anyone?) -- Of<br>
course some people might argue that wiping out most of the earth's<br>
population is a good thing. Sometimes I wonder...<br>
