<i>&gt;The easiest way to do an upload is the paint by numbers approach, replace  </i><br>
<i>&gt;each neuron with something much smaller and faster. To do this you'd need to </i><br>
<i>&gt;have a good understanding about neurons operate but you wouldn't need to</i><br>
know <br>
<i>&gt;how the brain as a whole operates. As you point out this is very limiting, </i><br>
<i>&gt;a billion fold increase in speed and immortality is about all we could</i><br>
expect <br>
<i>&gt;from it. To design something better we'd need to understand how intelligence </i><br>
<i>&gt;operates, and that could be enormously difficult. It could take uploads  </i><br>
<i>&gt;100,000 years of vigorous research to figure it out, that's about an hour </i><br>
<i>&gt;in our time. </i><br>
<p>
With faster brains imagine how that would change our society and social<br>
skills. Unless you had nanites, your body wouldn't be able to keep up with<br>
your brain so you'd need to slow it down. Someone could then ask you a<br>
question and you could set your brain into ultrafast thinking mode and<br>
ponder it for a few thousand years, sum it up into a sentence and answer<br>
the question. More would be accomplished in one second then in the entire<br>
history of the human race.<br>
