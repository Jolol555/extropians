<i>&gt; &gt;&lt;So we arrive back at the Great Filter problem.  The dinosaurs lived on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;earth for millions of years, but never evolved into tool-using creatures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Terence McKenna has suggested that when our ancestors discovered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;psychedelic mushrooms, that stimulated them to start thinking, talking, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;using tools.  That was when they broke through the filter and started</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;making progress.  Without mushrooms, we could have been stuck in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;evolutionary cul de sac for eons, like the dinosaurs.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I watched a show once where they suggested that it was the introduction of</i><br>
<i>&gt; seafood into the proto-human diet between 4 and 7 million years ago that</i><br>
<i>&gt; triggered the increase in intelligence.  The diets of most primates are</i><br>
<i>&gt; lacking in several important neuro-active and bio-active compounds directly</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved in higher brain functions.  Many of these compounds are generally</i><br>
<i>&gt; only found abundantly in nature in seafoods.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Several studies have been done on the impact of diet on intelligence.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; lack of seafood in a diet (especially from saltwater sources) has been shown</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have direct impacts on the average intelligence of a population.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; compounds are especially important during childhood.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Iodine is a case in point.  Naturally, iodine is found almost exclusively in</i><br>
<i>&gt; seafood sources.  There is a region in inland China where 1 in 8 people is</i><br>
<i>&gt; technically mentally retarded, and few people in the region have "normal"</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence.  As a whole, the average IQ of people in this region is far</i><br>
<i>&gt; below the human average.  The reason has been determined to be iodine</i><br>
<i>&gt; deficiency.  They have no access to sources of iodine in their diet.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; are genetically normally, but lack of a key compound has rendered them less</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent than their genetically determined capability.  Unfortunately,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the effects of this are structural and irreversible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fortunately for many developed countries, iodine is artificially introduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the diet so that this is not a problem.  This may also be why countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; with high seafood diets also are among the highest in raw IQ as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The introduction nootropics into the proto-human diet was very likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for the advance of our species.  I don't know too much about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mushroom theory, but the seafood theory does seem plausible.  AFAIK, humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; are the only primates that eat seafood.</i><br>
