<i>&gt; I have a remarkably low tolerance for extremists of any stripe,...</i><br>
<p>
If you are aware of this fault in your reasoning process, why do<br>
you allow it to continue?  Content-free judgments like "extremist"<br>
or "simplistic" or "unnatural" are convenient ways to connote without<br>
having to denote; that is, to judge without having to define a<br>
standard of judgment, or scale of measurement.<br>
<p>
Many of Rand's arguments certainly deserve criticism.  She glosses<br>
over, almost to the point of willful ignorance, the prevalence of<br>
blind chance as a player in human success, weakening her arguments<br>
for capitalism on moral grounds (though not on practical grounds).<br>
Her views on sexuality, and on homosexuality in particular, are so<br>
divorced from the reality known by those with more experience that<br>
they should not be taken too seriously.  I am thoroughly unpersuaded<br>
by her defense of monopoly government and intellectual property law<br>
in light of Childs and Breyer.<br>
<p>
But that does not mean that one should either discount all of her<br>
ideas--most of which are remarkable, beautiful, and sound--because<br>
she missed a few, or that one should discount them with a broad and<br>
vague characterization like "extremist".  Instead, if one finds the<br>
ideas somehow unsatisfying, try to root out /why/, and whether the<br>
fault in reasoning is ours or hers.  Since reading AS and her other<br>
works, I have tried this many times, and I must admit that I almost<br>
always find the fault is mine (the few cases above are exceptions,<br>
and very rare ones).  <br>
<p>
I think your feeling of revulsion to things you characterize as<br>
"extremist" may have some usefulness as a mental shortcut, because<br>
many ideas that fit that epithet are indeed evil ones; but I do<br>
not think that induction from those few cases is valid reason.<br>
