                  PUBLIC WELFARE FOR <br>
<p>
                BILLIONAIRE ROSS PEROT<br>
<p>
<p>
By Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
Ross Perot may be a billionaire several times over thanks to large<br>
government contracts, but that will not stop him from grabbing <br>
as much of the taxpayers money as he can get his greedy little <br>
hands on. As The Washington Post (8/19/96, A1) reports:<br>
<p>
        VALLEY FORGE, Pa. Aug. 18 -- Billionaire Ross<br>
        Perot accepted the presidential nomination of<br>
        his new Reform Party tonight [ which evidence <br>
        suggests may have been rigged ] and surprised <br>
        his loyal followers by announcing that he will <br>
        accept federal funds and contributions from <br>
        individuals for his campaign instead of <br>
        bankrolling it himself.<br>
<p>
Ross Perot then condemned both Dole and Clinton for receiving <br>
contributions from political action campaigns. Perot said, <br>
"It is wrong. These guys are bought and paid for by the <br>
special interests." Of course tax consuming billionaire <br>
Ross Perot expects to be paid for by YOU -- whether <br>
you like it or not. <br>
<p>
Responding to Dole's claim to cut taxes, Perot said, "We <br>
tried it in the '80s and it didn't work." Right, greedy <br>
tax feeders like Perot gobbled up rising revenues twice <br>
as fast as they came in, hence the debt. Perot continued<br>
blasting tax cuts saying, "There's no free candy, no free <br>
lunch." Except, that is, for Ross Perot a la the taxpayers.<br>
<p>
If Ross Perot stands against the corrupt Washington D.C.<br>
establishment, why is he defending its claim to seize <br>
your property? It doesn't take a genius to see through<br>
this transparent tax-consuming con man.<br>
<p>
<p>
ALAS, THERE IS A SIGN OF HOPE ------<br>
<p>
The first and only presidential candidate to qualify for <br>
federal campaign matching funds and yet turn down this <br>
opportunity to plunder the taxpayers is the Libertarian <br>
Party candidate, Harry Browne. Principle over parasitic <br>
public plunder. Surely, among the presidential candidates <br>
the Libertarian Harry Browne stands alone on the moral <br>
high ground. But is moral high ground what voters, <br>
such as yourself, want?<br>
