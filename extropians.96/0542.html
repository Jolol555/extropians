Indeed I do.<br>

<p>
I don't see why. The allocation of the adjective stupid to a group of<br>
individuals is always going to result in that group feeling insulted, unless<br>
the members of the group accept themselves as stupid and accept the<br>
adjective as being without its negative connotations.<br>

<i>&gt;          bloody...") in my original posting.</i><br>
<p>
There's no particular why an educator would hope that, because there's no<br>
particular reason why 'stupid' should lose its negative connotations: and<br>
whilst it retains them the link between the two sentences is a perfectly<br>
reasonable one to construct. Even if there were a reason for 'stupid' to<br>
become emotion-neutral, I still don't see how it could do that unless the<br>
'league of stupid people' set out to reclaim the word for themselves. Highly<br>
unlikely, in my opinion.<br>
