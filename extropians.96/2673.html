Michael Lorrey said, "universal translators "may" be possible".<br>
<p>
With regards to aliens, the "may" ought to be stressed infinitely more.  I <br>
think it is extremely unlikely that any sort of "universal translator" will <br>
ever be possible.  My belief is that the sum of all human thinking is an <br>
almost insignificantly small subset of all possible ways of thinking.  I <br>
believe that nearly all ways of thinking are incomprehensible to the human <br>
mind.  Shit, most of the ideas I think about would be nearly incomprehensible <br>
to anyone not as intimately familiar with my mind as I am.  Nearly everything <br>
I think is impossible to translate into language that other humans would <br>
understand (I do try my best, though.  But what I'm able to translate is only <br>
a small subset of my thinking).  I think the situation would be even worse <br>
with aliens.  Communication is only possible among sufficiently similar <br>
systems.  Communication is a form of resonance, a way for one system to cause <br>
another to behave similarly.  The greater the resonance, the greater the <br>
communication between two systems.  If two systems aren't similar enough, they <br>
can't cause each other to resonate together.  They can't mimic each other to a <br>
high enough degree to be considered to be communicating.  Human minds share <br>
enough similarities that they can create sensory experiences for each other <br>
which cause their minds to think similarly about various things.  We can guess <br>
the mental patterns of another human, based on how they're acting (what sounds <br>
they're making, what bodily movements they're expressing, things like that).  <br>
We're good enough at guessing each other's mental states that we can maintain <br>
a reasonable level of communication.  And the better we get to know someone, <br>
the more accurately we learn to guess what they're thinking, based on their <br>
actions.  I don't think we'd have much luck guessing what a being truly alien <br>
was thinking.  Not well enough to communicate, I think.  <br>
<p>
I think that one of the basic reasons that humans have even the low level of <br>
communication that we do is because we mimic each other so much.  We mimic <br>
each other's forms of expression so much that we have developed a lot of <br>
common forms of expression that we use with each other.  Thus, we build a lot <br>
of similar memories.  We also have grown up in similar cultural and physical <br>
environments, so we have at least some common ground.  I see no reason to <br>
expect that aliens will have much at all in common with us in our thinking and <br>
our ways of doing things.<br>
