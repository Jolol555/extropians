I completely agree with Anders' comments, and those of Lyle on this topic.<br>
The Singularity idea has worried me for years -- it's a classic religious,<br>
Christian-style, end-of-the-world concept that appeals to people in western<br>
cultures deeply. It's also mostly nonsense, for the reasons recently<br>
articulated by Anders', Lyle, and Hal F. <br>
<p>
The Singularity concept has all the earmarks of an idea that can lead to<br>
cultishness, and passivity. There's a tremendous amount of hard work to be<br>
done and intellectually masturbating about a supposed Singularity is not<br>
going to get us anywhere.<br>
<p>
Since many Extropians, like others, seem to be prone to uncritically<br>
absorbing this idea, in my revision of the original Dynamic Optimism, I will<br>
add an analysis and warning of the Singularity idea. I suggested that the<br>
idea of uploading could be abused in a similar way, even though uploading<br>
seems far more reasonable that a Singularity.<br>
<p>
There is no heaven, there will be no Singularity. We can create a wonderful<br>
posthuman future where we will be unshackled from many human limits, but it<br>
will take critical thinking, creativity, and hard work.<br>
