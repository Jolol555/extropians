<i>&gt;&gt; Read the Bible's book of Genesis and thats pretty much how the uploaded</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lifestyle would be. You could create anything spontaneously or rapidly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; evolve it from a metaphysical goo just by thinking about it because an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; algorithm could read your virtual brainwaves. You could then proceed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; create an entire universe, possibly one even better designed than we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; currently have.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sounds nice, but you are not describing life as an upload, you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;describing life in a perfect virtual reality with super-AI. Granted, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;ew can do uploading, we will have so much computing power and probably AI</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the potential for virtual reality is going to be awesome (it better</i><br>
<i>&gt;be, or the newly uploaded people will go slowly insane from badly rendered</i><br>
<i>&gt;drinks or bugs in their body models). </i><br>
<p>
Gods in the judeo-christian sense mean all knowing which will be partially<br>
true as an upload since your brain will have access to the sum of human<br>
knowledge pooled into a vat of ideas stored all over the internet. Being a<br>
God also means having the power to create life and with nano, or even<br>
closer to our present time: genetic engineering. We have almost filled the<br>
requirements for being a judeo-christian god. Why would I need a super-AI<br>
for any of this? Human brains can already be make to multitask stemming<br>
from multiple personality disorder where multiple people can live out of<br>
the same brain. I am pretty sure that very few of the general population<br>
will upload if there is no virtual reality to live in. People will want to<br>
go through the uploading process as themselves with little difference and<br>
then proceed to make changes when desired. (They want to make sure they<br>
make it across the transition ok). The only people I can figure who'd<br>
upload without a virtual reality would be chronically depressed people,<br>
people nearing death and wishing to save their lives, or body haters. If we<br>
can look to our current virtual reality algorithms such as in games like<br>
Tekken 2, and Super Mario 64 we can pretty much bet that we _will_ have a<br>
superb virtual reality to dip into when uploading comes around about 2030.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, I would definitely start working on building worlds (not entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;universes at first), but their complexities are still limited by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;amount of computation power we have - and that will be limited and cost</i><br>
<i>&gt;money too. Read _Permutation City_ by Greg Egan for some ideas.</i><br>
<p>
You need not even render them! You can describe them in fine detail on<br>
paper or in a text file and when truely simple VRML design tools come<br>
around, you can begin building these worlds and gradually upgrade them to<br>
the next design format standard that comes out and continually increase the<br>
detail till uploading time comes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem I see with many of the uploading scenarios I hear on this list</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that they are all too often of the kind "And after you are uploaded,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you become God." It isn't that simple - working uploading won't change</i><br>
<i>&gt;your mind very much (if it did, it wouldn't be you that emerged in</i><br>
<i>&gt;cyberspace).</i><br>
<p>
Won't change your mind much? Hows knowing the sum of human knowledge sound?<br>
Remember with uploading you fill the requirements for a judeo-christian god<br>
which is the god-like being standards which most people refer to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So when you are 'reborn' you will be an emulation of 10^11</i><br>
<i>&gt;neurons, their activity and lots of other pseudobiological data. Of</i><br>
<i>&gt;course, self-transformation now becomes almost too trivial (remember to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make backups often!) and you will be able to change much of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;structure.</i><br>
<p>
Why in even a primitive upload you will have some sort of virtual<br>
environment such as looking through the eyes of an avatar in Alpha World or<br>
having the first person perspective of the player in quake. You will have<br>
some sort of sensory data coming in or it would be torture to sit in stasis<br>
waiting for technology to increase to the point of good VR. Especially as<br>
an uploaded being, waiting for sufficently advanced VR would be torture<br>
because if your mental processes are _much_ faster, one day of waiting may<br>
seem like 10 years and this is a very conservative estimate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But you won't immediately be able to go far beyond your old</i><br>
<i>&gt;limits, they have to be untangled and enhanced away. This will require a</i><br>
<i>&gt;lot of *work*. It will quite likely be painful and tiring (in a mental</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense). It will take time.</i><br>
<p>
It would be alot of work but you'd enjoy every bit of it because you're<br>
doing it for yourself and your could even program yourself to release<br>
endorphins through the entire process. Painful and tiring? You're no longer<br>
limited to chemistry and physics so you can secrete unlimited amounts of<br>
any brain hormone and keep your neural pathways in tip top shape.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The exception may be uploading through gradual extension: when you become</i><br>
<i>&gt;100% uploaded, you are already quite evolved. But you are still far from</i><br>
<i>&gt;being a god. </i><br>
<p>
Ahhh there we go. The way I wish to be uploaded will be through gradual<br>
incremental uploading so that "I" will be the uploaded, virtual, digital,<br>
being rather than a digital duplicate running around as me. I could care<br>
less if my ideas were the only thing that transferred to the digital realm.<br>
I want to live in it! ME! ME! ME!<br>
