It's difficult to decide what sort of effect wormholes (iffy though they<br>
are) would have on cultural diversity without considering what sort of<br>
bandwidth they might provide relative to the routine bandwidth available<br>
for local (non-wormhole) travel and communication. (I know that<br>
generalizing bandwidth to cover travel and transportation is a little<br>
weird, but it's hard to beat the bandwidth of a 747 loaded up with CDs or<br>
humans. And increasingly inexpensive air travel, in my opinion, promotes<br>
long-term cultural homogenization even more effectively than satellite TV.)<br>
<p>
If the two levels don't differ much from one another, then you have a<br>
situation that tends toward cultural homogenization. But if the local<br>
bandwidth is very much greater than the available wormhole bandwidth, I<br>
think that within a fairly small sphere (contained within the galactic<br>
plane, say) you could get a great deal of cultural diversity in a short<br>
time.<br>
<p>
But taking this further would require a highly speculative (to say the<br>
least) economic analysis of wormhole construction, and considering how<br>
speculative the physics and theoretical-applied-science is already, I doubt<br>
anyone's going to put much work into that particular study anytime soon.<br>
But it might be fun in a few more years.<br>
<p>
Actually, I just realized that everywhere I said "bandwidth" above, I<br>
should have said "bandwidth costs", mutatis mutandum. But if I carry this<br>
on, I'll be doing the study myself, and fun as this is, other priorities<br>
call me away for the time being.<br>
