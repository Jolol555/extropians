Suresh Naidu said, to Ian Goddard, "You say the natural relationship between <br>
humans is trade. I say it's cooperation."<br>
<p>
Suresh, if you want food and I want a house, and we each have what the other <br>
wants, when we make a trade with each other, isn't this cooperation?  I don't <br>
see how you can maintain that trade isn't cooperation, when it most clearly <br>
is.  In a trade, all parties are cooperating with each other for everyone's <br>
benefit.  This is cooperation.  This is working together to achieve common <br>
goals.  I'm not sure why you refuse to see that.  <br>
<p>
In trading and in the capitalist system, only those who are willing to <br>
cooperate with others can make any money.  In the capitalist system, people <br>
don't trade unless they will get something in return that they value at least <br>
as much as what they're giving up.  This means that those who don't offer <br>
others value don't profit from the capitalist system.  This means that <br>
non-cooperative behaviour is AUTOMATICALLY cast out of the capitalist system, <br>
by its very nature.  <br>
<p>
In the capitalist system, those who don't pull their own weight don't get a <br>
ride.  In other words, unless you help people, they won't help you.  Thus, the <br>
capitalist system is cooperative AT EVERY TRANSACTION.  Certainly you don't <br>
advocate a system of "cooperation", where a lot of people who are able to work <br>
don't contribute to society but still receive the benefits of other's work.  <br>
These people would not be cooperating with the rest of society; they would be <br>
parasites.  The capatilist system has a very elegant way of getting rid of <br>
parasites; no one will trade with them because they have nothing to offer in <br>
return. (Although truly helpless people are often given assistance by those <br>
with kind hearts)<br>
<p>
The capitalist system is ENTIRELY about cooperation.  It is the best system of <br>
cooperation that exists.  Every act of trade is an act of cooperation.  Those <br>
who aren't willing to cooperate won't be able to find anyone to trade with.  <br>
Thus, the capitalist system encourages people to cooperate, and the more they <br>
cooperate with others, the more they are rewarded.<br>
<p>
Suresh, you reveal what you truly are against with this sentence: "But I also <br>
hate and fear the business interests which lie to me with their advertising <br>
and poison my water with their pollution."<br>
<p>
You are against lies and pollution, according to this statement.  Yes, some <br>
businesses do pollute and do lots of other awful things, but that is no reason <br>
to get rid of businesses and the capitalist system entirely.  It would be like <br>
killing all humans because some of them do terrible things.  <br>
<p>
You are not really against the capitalist system, because it is EXACTLY the <br>
type of massive, large scale cooperation that you have been advocating.  You <br>
are against people cooperating with each other to pollute and to lie to other <br>
people.  Unless you get clear about what the real enemy is, you're like a <br>
blind soldier, wandering around the battlefield, blowing away friend and enemy <br>
alike.  <br>
<p>
The capitalist system is fundamentally a GOOD thing; it is about people coming <br>
together, by mutual agreement, and trading what they have with each other.  It <br>
is also a good way of insuring that those who refuse to contribute to society <br>
don't get to benefit from it either (unless someone chooses to give them <br>
something).  <br>
<p>
Get clear about what you're REALLY against, and attack THAT; don't attack <br>
people for engaging in the peaceful activities of helping each other by <br>
exchanging goods and services.  By attacking the capitalist system, you attack <br>
the very thing you advocate; cooperation.<br>
