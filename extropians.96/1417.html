<i>&gt; &gt; our fantasies and imagination are objective, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sense that they are actually occuring inside our own heads.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Our fantasies and imagination are subjective, in the sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;      that they are actually occuring inside our own heads."</i><br>
<p>
	Who says that our fantasies and imagination are happening<br>
	inside our heads?  They could be happening inside the big<br>
	toe of the guy down the street, for all that it matters.<br>
<p>
     Objective:  Being the object of perception or thought;<br>
	belonging to the object of thought rather than the <br>
	thinking subject.<br>
<p>
     Subjective:  Existing in the mind; belonging to the <br>
	thinking subject rather than to the object of thought.<br>
<p>
	-Both- are happening as a result of the mind*.  It is<br>
	only when two or more people get together that the<br>
	distinction between objective/perception and <br>
	subjective/creation become important.  Otherwise <br>
	fantasies and realities	might as well be the same.<br>
<p>
	*	Please note that I did not use the term inside,<br>
	which is where I believe that most of the confusion is<br>
	coming from.  To say that a seemingly intangable thing<br>
	'is somewhere' leads to misconceptions, and strange loops<br>
	of logic.  I am not sure if a thought is an electron<br>
	crusing around a neuron, or if it is something completely<br>
	untangable.  Also, electrons only seem to exist, I do not<br>
	claim to know for sure if they do or do not exist.<br>
