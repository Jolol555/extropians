General Reply -<br>
<p>
I've responded to several replies to my tentative VRML proposal<br>
individually, but decided it may be simpler to post a general reply that<br>
tries to address each of the excellent points and suggestions being made...<br>
<p>
Yudhowsky made some excellent points about what type<br>
of underlying gaming architecture should be considered<br>
 - Yes, you can specify behaviors in VRML with Java.  While<br>
Java was designed specifically for VRML, the lastest<br>
version of VRML, also called "Moving Worlds", was designed<br>
with java-scripting in mind.  It also supports RSX sound<br>
compression, which is I have so far to be quite impressive.<br>
 - As for user-specified "room" addition - this is where things<br>
get tricky (At least for a novice like myself). <br>
 I have seen code where by the user can activate a script that<br>
will spawn "child nodes", which if we set it up right could have the desired<br>
effect of customized user  expansion of the world.  This is where any<br>
experience with<br>
MOO's would be valuable.  Somewhere else it would be valuable is in working<br>
the avatars.  So far multi-user shared VRML worlds are quite rare, but "The<br>
Circus", multiple-user world at Sony's "Community Place" VRML Browser site<br>
is one example...<br>
<p>
<p>
Max More made an excellent point about commercial viability and incentives.<br>
Right now I'm in the process of setting up a start-up with a few friends of<br>
mine.  We hope to break into the website development market;  we'll be doing<br>
HTML, Java, cgi, 2D/3D web graphics, and VRML.  The Transhumanist Virtual<br>
World would make a perfect place to showcase our skills.  That already gives<br>
me a monetary incentive to keep going with it, <br>
as well as both my friends (who are very skilled computer-wise and happen to<br>
be transhumanists...)<br>
Eventually, we could market the world itself, charging so much per hour;<br>
if that ever happens we'd make sure there was always a minimum access level<br>
where any non-paying user could still use the world.  Actually, one<br>
possibility that might allow<br>
the world to "pay for itself"  could be renting out that "office" space to<br>
corporations;<br>
it would be like advertising, but also a place to do real business at the<br>
same time.  <br>
Lots to consider.  One thing that I am quite confident in though is<br>
that if it gets off the ground with enough momentum, it will just keep on<br>
going.  Also keep in mind what we are working towards isn't one<br>
person's or group's world sitting on one server, but rather a <br>
transhumanist "multiverse" of sorts...those interested in setting<br>
up commercial areas will be free to do so, but no one will be held<br>
back in either direction...<br>
<p>
Basically, what I had in mind for the here and now was to put together a<br>
"nucleus world" - it would contain the initial forms of the locales<br>
mentioned in my first post.  Structurally, I'm picturing a straightforward<br>
fractal landform, in the middle of which an open space with some buildings,<br>
cafes, surrounded by one side by water and the other sides by<br>
high mountains where we can have paths leading underground, or to<br>
summits with nice views, or to portals to other worlds...a starry background <br>
would be nice, but not just white dots on black, but something like the <br>
pleiades cluster or a nebula, maybe two or three moons.  Not too unlike<br>
the descriptions in BeyondMOO, which I found very appropriately capture the<br>
transhumanist "sense of life" (A VRML sculpture of Prometheus would<br>
be definitely by a nice touch..)<br>
<p>
There seems to be of a schism - some are hoping to revel in an<br>
incredibly decentralized world, others are understandably concerned<br>
<p>
Chill out everyone - this is a fully object oriented endeavour!<br>
<p>
The process I imagine is as follows:<br>
<p>
1. Someone thinks of a useful addition<br>
2. Suggestion is made, feedback given, approval made unless<br>
serious objection made, in which case put to vote by appropriate<br>
"team".<br>
2. Addition is created and rendered, final result is a<br>
VRML object.<br>
3. Object is added as a node to one of several linked worlds.<br>
(If large enough, may warrant being a sub-world of its own, in <br>
which case it will just become another world)<br>
4. Addition will be visible, but will likely start off as<br>
just something to look at or a place to go, until someone<br>
assigns it a behavior.  This is where those<br>
<p>
<p>
Basically I see two different approaches - both valid and both<br>
very valuable. <br>
<p>
A) The World-builder/Renderer/3D-Artist;  mainly interested in<br>
building the world; creating interesting settings and places to go and see.<br>
<p>
B) The Animator/RPGer/Gamer; wants interaction - concerned<br>
with avatars, user interaction, user-agent interaction,<br>
animating behaviors, how users might add rooms,<br>
basically how the world can alter the user/character and how<br>
the user/character can alter the world and other user/characters.<br>
 <br>
(Of course there will be people that will dig both and see any<br>
division as silly, but for now I'll address the role of each individually)<br>
<p>
Basically all I have to say to the first category, is <br>
let your imaginations run wild.  Don't worry about how it "might<br>
all fit together" - that can be left to the second who have a more<br>
holistic, structured vision in mind.  If an idea is any good, it<br>
will find a place.  The second group will likely be more worried<br>
about tying it all together and imposing some modicum of order<br>
to it all, but really there is no dichotomy - I agree in part with those who<br>
are worried about a structured underlying gaming/character/event engine -<br>
lessons learned from working with MOO's/MUDs are all applicable, but<br>
those problems are mostly self-contained to the "gaming" or multi-user<br>
layer of the world.  Most VRML worlds out there have nothing like <br>
MOO or traditional adventure-game interface, mostly are just arrays<br>
of lifeless objects that you walk around in.  Let us build<br>
the world physically, and when it does come time to breath life into it,<br>
then we will worry about having the best, most flexible, reliable and open<br>
gaming architecture possible.  <br>
<p>
So for the renderers: don't worry about limits; there are none.<br>
For the coders and scripters: an intelligently designed <br>
set of primitives is a good idea, and we should get started as early<br>
as possible.  Personally, my skills lie in the rendering/graphic design<br>
area right now, and I'm currently in the process of closing the<br>
gap.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I've been caught off guard and don't yet even<br>
have my own homepage up!! Perhaps someone could volunteer<br>
part of their own to post bulletins, guidelines, listings<br>
of objects and worlds so far, useful/relevant links, suggestion<br>
form...<br>
<p>
Also, I did make the original post, but that doesn't make me any<br>
kind of an authority on what form the entire thing will take...<br>
I hope to be with the project all the way, but have no aspirations<br>
towards being or forming a central authority (sigh of relief amongst<br>
radical libertarian/Spontaneous order mavens....)<br>
As R.A. Wilson is fond of saying, "Communication is only possible<br>
between peers..."<br>
<p>
That's all for now...I have a feeling I'm going to be quite busy<br>
for a next little while...For now I will suggest some short-term objectives.<br>
<p>
- Web Page mentioned above<br>
- Scour net for VRML worlds that might be technically<br>
similar to what we're talking about (MOO's and MUDs as well,<br>
as Yudowsky mention can be instructive)<br>
- Brainstorm ideas - add and modify the scene list in my very<br>
first post<br>
- Familiarize oneself with VRML 2.0, Java and combining the two.<br>
- Continue with the wonderful discussion/debate already going on...<br>
- I've already started compiling a list of people who have expressed interest<br>
and the particular skills they have mentioned; I'll wait a while<br>
for any more such posts and compile a working list so we can<br>
start assembling very loose "teams"...<br>
<p>
<p>
BTW - A note to the musically inclined.  Personally I'm heavily<br>
into Jazz Fusion as well as Electronic/Synth type stuff like Tangerine<br>
Dream, Vangelis.  I haven't heard a lot of techno, but something<br>
definitely in the upbeat direction and spacey/synthy sound would<br>
be perfect background.  My only preference is to keep most of it<br>
instrumental.<br>
