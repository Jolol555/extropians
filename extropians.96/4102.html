Eliezer said, "And, as always, remember that frustration leads to higher SAT <br>
scores."<br>
<p>
I got fairly high SAT scores (750V/770M), but I wasn't frustrated, any more <br>
than I am when I do simple arithmetic.  The test was just easy.  The answers <br>
generally just seemed obvious.  Actually knowing the stuff leads to higher SAT <br>
scores.  Frustration is a good trigger of creativity, but creativity is not <br>
required in the SAT test, just certain skills.<br>
