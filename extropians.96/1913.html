Ask not what your brand name can do for you, <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IAN: Therein arises a key question: </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Who is to determine the proper level of " need " ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         ^^^</i><br>
<p>
Yep. Valid question. This is why decentralization is the key to any  <br>
equitable society. In small scale communities, people can keep tabs on <br>
each other, done with a feeling of "hey, this hurts people, why <br>
don't you stop it" . if you have any form of centralization, a huge power <br>
imbalance occurs, because the ones in charge can dictate to those not in <br>
charge. It becomes self-perpetuating, and is thus communism. <br>
<p>
But, thanks to such technologies as the internet, people can raise <br>
discussions all over the world, and so everybody will have the <br>
opportunity to discuss what need is. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Each person measures their own need. I cannot know everything </i><br>
<i>&gt; about the specific needs of even those right around me, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; even less about the needs of people in the next city, county, </i><br>
<i>&gt; or country. However, for equitable distribution of wealth to </i><br>
<i>&gt; ever be a reality someone MUST have such GLOBAL knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; upon which to measure proper levels of "need."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That "someone" will be a central cabal of economic planners. </i><br>
<i>&gt; These planners will, by human nature, exploit the masses for </i><br>
<i>&gt; personal gain through economic / social control and command. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Private property claims can be enforced </i><br>
<i>&gt; locally, requiring only LOCAL knowledge. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   ERGO: Private property does NOT </i><br>
<i>&gt;   require a central State.</i><br>
<p>
No, but is does require force to back it up, which is just as bad.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Collectivist social theory requires a central </i><br>
<i>&gt; cabal with GLOBAL knowledge, that is to say, </i><br>
<i>&gt; with knowledge derived from a broad section </i><br>
<i>&gt; of socail indicators and incomes, from which</i><br>
<i>&gt; "equitable" distributions are determined and </i><br>
<i>&gt; based upon which legal decrees are issued.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   ERGO: Collectivized property </i><br>
<i>&gt;   require a central State by design.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No, because I have enough faith in people that they can coordinate <br>
themselves, share knowledge through electronic means, and then discuss <br>
the issues this raises. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Furthermore, the collectivists theory of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; " socail contract, " that is defined as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; personal debt to the socail welfare that </i><br>
<i>&gt; abolishes any concept of private ownership, </i><br>
<i>&gt; weaves a logical and factual LEGAL web of </i><br>
<i>&gt; social debt that binds all people to one</i><br>
<i>&gt; another and in turn binds them to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; central cabal of planners that oversee </i><br>
<i>&gt; the allocation of social debt, who are </i><br>
<i>&gt; know as are "The People's" Party, </i><br>
<i>&gt; or the slave masters.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It's not a legal web, it's an economic one. However, if anyone wants to <br>
leave they can, and do whatever they want. But people will not stand for <br>
theives or dictators. Noting stops a person from going off and living off <br>
the land, and they might even keep ties with society. Imagine a woodsman <br>
opening a solar powered laptop to offer environmental reports.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  On the other hand:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The free market price system spontaneously transmits </i><br>
<i>&gt; the necessary information for local planers -- owners --</i><br>
<i>&gt; to adjust their activity toward to service of consumer, </i><br>
<i>&gt; i.e., socail, need. The free market society is run </i><br>
<i>&gt; by the invisible hand, the invisible hand is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; invisible planner, is the mind of the masses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The free market is the spontaneous and</i><br>
<i>&gt; decentrally directed collective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
No it is not, because the fundamental relationship is one of slavery: <br>
worker-employer. There is a huge power imbalance there. And since there<br>
always will be more workers than employers, the majority of people will <br>
be screwed.<br>
