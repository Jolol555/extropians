I've always been fond of Tom's essay in Extropy #3 pointing out that sex<br>
is, or at least can be, the highest-bandwidth form of communication<br>
possible between two human beings. Given my own recently growing<br>
conviction that (at least minimal) communication with other rational<br>
beings is part and parcel of rationality, this way of thinking about sex<br>
could lead to some interesting research programs into the possibility that<br>
sexual behavior (or at least some kinds of sexual behavior) can directly<br>
enhance cognitive function and even, yes, rationality. <br>
