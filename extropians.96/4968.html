<i>&gt; You throw out any code that might break the security,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even when it doesn't, *because* of the halting problem. Only simple code</i><br>
<i>&gt; will pass the verifier. So you're limiting people's ability to write good,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast code in order to ensure that it's theoretically secure. If GNU come</i><br>
<i>&gt; out with a super-duper highly-optimized free compiler which doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce the same bytecode as Sun, then their applications will be bounced.</i><br>
<p>
Tough luck for GNU.  I know what the Java bytecodes are and how they're<br>
verified, and that shouldn't pose any major barrier to optimizing<br>
compilers if a bit of intelligence is exercised in their design.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; More to the point, a 'secure' language should not need a verifier. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; mere fact that Java bytecode must be verified before it's run shows that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the bytecode is not secure</i><br>
I agree.  If I'd designed the bytecodes, they'd be inherently secure and<br>
we could write self-modifying Java code.  (All you need are multiple<br>
stacks.)  However, the Java language is not just bytecode, but bytecode<br>
+ verifier.<br>
<p>
(From me:)<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In point of fact, if Java wasn't secure, *then* I could write a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Turing machine capable of solving the halting problem.</i><br>
How?  Easy enough:  A Turing machine is vulnerable to the halting<br>
problem only because it can be encapsulated within a Universal Turing<br>
Machine.  (See Turing's original argument.)  If the encapsulation can be<br>
broken, I can modify the Turing machine to correctly say "Goes on<br>
forever" when implemented on the basic level, and (incorrectly say)<br>
"halts immediately" when encapsulated by the UTM, thus making it<br>
invulnerable to the halting problem.  This only works if the<br>
encapsulation can always be broken.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And how exactly do you prove there are no flaws in the implementation? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Plenty have been found and exploited already, and more will be.</i><br>
How do you prove that there are no chocolate cakes in the Asteroid belt,<br>
especially when the first SF fans to enter the Asteroid belt,<br>
particularly via time travel, will probably toss a chocolate cake in<br>
there out of sheer mischief?<br>
