Ian's post about terrorism prompted some random thoughts:<br>
<p>
First, as a matter of my own personal practice, I find it is usually not<br>
fruitful to comment on the weight of evidence in any particular pending case<br>
that has interest to the general public (look at the billions of wasted words<br>
in connection with the OJ Simpson case ...).  This is because both sides in<br>
the actual case have a strong interest in *advocacy* rather than<br>
truth-seeking (that's how the system is supposed to work, after all) and<br>
unless you're involved in the case personally as party, judge, advocate or<br>
juror, you're unlikely to see anything like a balanced presentation of<br>
evidence.  While a "fair" legal journalist may attempt to present a balanced<br>
subset of the evidence and arguments, taking that journalist's presentation<br>
as a basis of opinion is just accepting her work as a substitute for the<br>
gestalt of a trial.  As we say down here in Tejas, no matter how thin you<br>
pour the pancakes, they always have two sides.  That's why we have trials.<br>
<p>
An aside: For what its worth, Ian, one of McVeigh's lead lawyers, Michael<br>
Tigar, is known to me to be a tough, bright, creative and highly capable<br>
lawyer.  Tigar will see to it that McVeigh gets the fairest possible trial,<br>
leaving no stone unturned and exploiting every weakness and error in the<br>
state's case.  I don't know anyone on the prosecution side of the case, but<br>
chances are Tigar's twice the lawyer any one of them could ever hope to be.<br>
<p>
That said, however, Ian has referred to something that has troubled me.  I've<br>
noted a disturbing phenomenon when discussing extropianism and transhumanism<br>
with folks who are either aware of the ideas themselves or not: Through some<br>
memetic mapping process, people seem to somehow link these movements with the<br>
violent fringe crazies of the "militia movement".  Unfortunately, it seems<br>
that the wild-eyed "militiamen" have become icons in the public consciousness<br>
that stand far too close to the concept of liberty.<br>
<p>
I can't claim to have made anything like an in-depth study of the so-called<br>
militia movement.  But what I have read and seen doesn't impress me.  I can<br>
say their "legal" writings I've seen on the Net don't cut the mustard for me:<br>
By and large they seem to be a mish-mash of half-baked caricatures of the<br>
traditional common law and ideology from the time of the US Revolution,<br>
pasted together crudely to reach the results they want without any real<br>
analysis of the ideas they borrow and steal.  The so-called "common law<br>
courts" they have put together seem more like kangaroo courts thrown up as<br>
rationalization machines to publicize their ideas, rather than tribunals for<br>
resolving disputes, the only legitimate purpose of a court.  In this they<br>
serve exactly the same purpose as Stalin's show trials: Ideological theater.<br>
 Nothing is more threatening to the ideal of law.<br>
<p>
Beyond this, the "militia movement" seems far too broad to generate much, if<br>
any good.  Most of its adherents seem to accept unquestioningly that a<br>
powerful state should exist; they just don't like the one they happen to live<br>
in and claim the right to violently oppose its policies.  That's bad medicine<br>
in my book.  Furthermore, there are undeniable racist and fundamentalist<br>
religious currents in the militia culture, absolute anathema to extropians.<br>
<p>
Ian writes:<br>
<i>&gt; It is possible that terrorist events could be used as modern day Reichstag </i><br>
<i>&gt;  fires, establishing the pretext for massive increases in police state </i><br>
<i>&gt;  powers, "new anti-terrorist powers" to be brought to bear against </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "anti-govt hard-liners."</i><br>
<p>
I don't doubt for a minute that this is true.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In fact, that is exactly the result. It </i><br>
<i>&gt;  would be too easy -- well, no, .. it IS too easy. But only as long </i><br>
<i>&gt;  as people do not question and examine the gov't / media story.</i><br>
<p>
I, too, cringe at the infringements of personal liberty that both mainstream<br>
political parties are falling over each other to implement in the name of<br>
"anti-terrorism."  But there doesn't need to be a "statist conspiracy" for<br>
this to have happened.  In fact, this is probably just the natural result of<br>
the market for votes operating unconsciously on the sellers of "political<br>
goods" (can you tell I just finished "The Machinery of Freedom"???).  <br>
<p>
I've constructed a little alarm in my mind that goes off whenever the "Hitler<br>
meme" is invoked.  The rhetorical power of images of Nazis is so great that<br>
I'm suspicious of their use.  Those images should be used *very* carefully so<br>
as no to debase the currency of historical analogy.  If you call Bob Dole a<br>
"fascist", you don't have anything left to distinguish Herman Goering.<br>
<p>
Finally, of course we should "examine the gov't/media story".  That is why we<br>
have public trials.  But let's recall that the trial *will* be public and the<br>
public will be treated to a view of Michael Tigar's talents in defense of Mr.<br>
McVeigh.  Contrary to the rhetoric of the militiamen, this isn't Berlin or<br>
Moscow in 1936.<br>
