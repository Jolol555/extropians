i agree with Steve, Sex and Death are two basic mechanisms of evolution.<br>
Whether Technological/Cultural evolution will not need them, or whether<br>
it'll use them in it's own way is an open question.  I suspect that <br>
the evolutionary strategy has good efficient reasons for them.<br>
Afterall, all life has sex and dies, (with the exception, maybe, of<br>
bactaria and virii ).<br>
<p>
Sex is also in human terms, a form of communication, reassurrance, bonding,<br>
recreation, pleasure and sometimes power.<br>
<p>
Im new to this mailing group, ive read and i like a lot of the basic <br>
books that extropians recommend.   I find it a bit sad that such obviously<br>
intelligent people seem to have a blind spot regarding the complexity<br>
and sophistication of day to day human relationships.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that some people here want to become not so much Transhuman<br>
as non-human.<br>
