<i>&gt;COMPUTER CRACKERS ADOPT NEW STRATEGY FOR BREAK-INS</i><br>
<i>&gt;Recent attacks on computer systems have adopted a new strategy for cracking</i><br>
<i>&gt;security codes, exploiting the way that imperfect computers implement</i><br>
<i>&gt;encryption systems in the real world.  Scientists at Princeton University</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Bellcore have been working together to discover how they can force a</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer or encoding chip to err in its calculations while encrypting a</i><br>
<i>&gt;message and, at the same time, leak information about the message being</i><br>
<i>&gt;encrypted.  One way they found to do this is by irradiating the chip, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then by comparing a number of error-ridden encryptions with a single</i><br>
<i>&gt;flawless one, they discovered they were able to crack virtually any</i><br>
<i>&gt;public-key system.  Their technique was carried a step further by</i><br>
<i>&gt;researchers at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, allowing them to decipher</i><br>
<i>&gt;the secret key from a 56-bit Data Encryption Standard algorithm with little</i><br>
<i>&gt;trouble, using "differential fault analysis."  This doesn't mean that</i><br>
<i>&gt;encryption doesn't work, says Richard DeMillo, a member of the Bellcore</i><br>
<i>&gt;team.  "It's a matter of recognizing vulnerability," and doing something</i><br>
<i>&gt;about it.  (Science Magazine 1 Nov 96 p716)</i><br>
<p>
There are some implications for the "play dirt" strategy: first of all, you<br>
have to be invulnerable to any sort of attack, both by redundancy and<br>
rerouting, and also in the sense of not revealing anything when stressed.<br>
Sounds like we haven't achieved anything like the latter--current<br>
cryptosystems seem to spill the beans under torture.<br>
<p>
Second, the way the technology of cryptology evolves in our world today<br>
is by constant attempts to defeat what has gone before.  If this were<br>
simply institutionalized--with testing on live subjects, as it were--it<br>
would provide a way to simultaneously improve one's weapons, seek out and<br>
attack enemies or prey, and enforce the "lie low" rule.  Just constantly<br>
shoot bullets over everyone's heads.  Of course, you keep backups, don't<br>
you?<br>
