All people make sense, I tell myself.  If you know their values (which<br>
may be inconsistent) and their perceptions (which may be 'flawed') then<br>
you know them.  So I tell myself.  In fact, empathy may be much easier<br>
with different or even inconsistent values than with different<br>
perceptive systems and filters...<br>

} "doomsday argument" at length.  This is the idea that if the human race is<br>

...e.g. I find this argument utterly bizarre.  Whether 21st century<br>
humanity dies out or goes on to Omega, to reach the 21st century someone<br>
had to live in the 20th.  That happens to be us.  If someone else lived<br>
now, "we" wouldn't live later on; "we" are those who live here and now,<br>
who have grown up in this century.<br>

When contemplating any future with a history, given that the future will<br>
happen the probability of the history having happened is 1.<br>

} the point it was created, within a few decades of the year 2000.  Hence<br>

<p>
So what about the 19th century?  Or the 5th B.C.?  Someone lived through<br>
those moments.  Should Babbage have commented on how unlikely it was for<br>
him to have existed?<br>
<p>
I'm not sure about the dice.  Every instinct says that the probability<br>
is always 1/36, but I haven't figured out how to refute the 90% argument<br>
in the past couple of minutes.<br>

"Perhaps you are thinking: "But a tank costs several million dollars,<br>
  not including floor mats. I don't have that kind of money."<br>
Don't be silly. You're a consumer, right? You have credit cards, right?<br>
Perhaps you are thinking: "Yes, but how am I going to pay the credit-card<br>
  company?"<br>
Don't be silly. You have a tank, right?" -- Dave Barry<br>
