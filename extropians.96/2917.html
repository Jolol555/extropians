Like hell.  Visualize "sunset".  Now visualize "dusk".  Which image do you<br>
want to remove from your list of communicable images (I don't know about yours,<br>
but my image of "dusk" has no sun in it)?  What kind of 1984-type language<br>
reductionism is this?  why don't we just call them "light-start" and<br>
"dark-start"?  Yeesh.<br>
<p>
Sorry for the outburst, but I love the English language for its richness.<br>
<p>

<p>
"Patient" comes from the Latin root "pati-", "to endure".  I can certainly<br>
see how that applies to both senses of the word.  Saying that someone (like<br>
a doctor) makes a "horrible patient" captures both at once.<br>
<p>
"Teacher - student" is a relationship that applies when someone who has<br>
certain knowledge has agreed to transmit it, and someone else has agreed<br>
to receive it (or in school to at least be present while it's transmitted --<br>
sigh).  That the teacher might learn something in the process doesn't<br>
invalidate the relationship.  Sorry, I think this one has a place in the<br>
language, too.<br>
<p>
BTW, if I had to pick a word whose concept I'd like to erase from the language,<br>
I think I'd have to pick "sin" hands-down.<br>
<p>
Out of curiosity, what would you do with "fall in love"?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
