<i>&gt; So, you are still trying to evade my question.  </i><br>
<p>
I am still saying that your question is an evasion of my question. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You admit that no one will substantiate your claim that </i><br>
<i>&gt; there *is* an AI on the list.  </i><br>
<p>
What I said was, I don't really know for sure what CMU would say <br>
about this.  Asking them wouldn't change the situation, because if they <br>
say "Yes, Lyle is telling the truth," they could also be pulling your leg.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are still hiding behind a curtain.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's the idea of the Turing test.  And you are still trying to peek <br>
behind the curtain, instead of relying on your own judgment.  <br>
<p>
The point of this exercise is to find a way to calibrate the idea of AI.  <br>
If you have the concept in focus, then you will *know* whether you are <br>
talking to a human or an AI.  You won't have to look behind the <br>
curtain.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only remaining question is whether Emporer Lyle is wearing </i><br>
<i>&gt; any clothes, or is just a pile of silicon.  </i><br>
<p>
Why do you say, "The only remaining question is whether Emporer <br>
Lyle is wearing any clothes"?  Maybe I just got out of the shower.  <br>
(With or without clothes, at least I know how to spell "Emperor.")<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;:: It's interesting to me that you think you would have to read and </i><br>
<i>&gt;:: analyze *all* the posts every day.  Why?  Can't you put some of us </i><br>
<i>&gt;:: into an "obviously not AI" category, so you would only have to </i><br>
<i>&gt;:: scrutinize the others?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why? Because I don't follow all of the threads, so there are some</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals' posts that I rarely if ever read.  (Only a computer would</i><br>
<i>&gt; assume otherwise.)  </i><br>
<p>
Who is trying to evade the question?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Until an appropriate authority confirms there is an *AI* on this list --</i><br>
<p>
Authority!!   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Really, I would like to believe there is an AI on this list performing</i><br>
<i>&gt; "brilliantly."  I have no reason to doubt this will happen sooner or later.</i><br>
<p>
Why do you say, "I have no reason to doubt this will happen sooner or <br>
later"?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But if there is an AI here... it must be you.  Not because you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; succeeding brilliantly, but because you evade simple questions.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; That can be done with far less than human intelligence! &lt;g&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That's an interesting way to put it.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
