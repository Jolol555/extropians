<i>&gt; Cut-price space flight crept closer last week, following tests of a </i><br>
<i>&gt; lightweight liquid-fuelled rocket engine in New Mexico.  Its makers, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Californian company Microcosm, claim that the Scorpius rocket </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be significantly cheaper than its competitors.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The company plans to develop Scorpius rockets that can put larger </i><br>
<i>&gt; payloads into orbit for under $1000 per pound.  This compares with </i><br>
<i>&gt; roughly $10,000 for the shuttle.  Microcosm's president, James </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wertz, claims that the new rockets will be more reliable than </i><br>
<i>&gt; competing engines.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since some of the engineering in the Scorpius rocket is not yet </i><br>
<i>&gt; patented, Microcosm will not reveal all its tricks, but Wertz says the </i><br>
<i>&gt; company has taken advantage of new materials and eliminated the </i><br>
<i>&gt; most expensive parts of traditional designs.  "This engine is not a </i><br>
<i>&gt; breakthrough in performance for liquid propulsion systems, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather a major breakthrough in cost," he says.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Scorpius does not have turboprops to deliver fuel to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; combustion chamber and the engine is not mounted on gimbals to </i><br>
<i>&gt; direct its thrust.  This eliminates some of the most expensive </i><br>
<i>&gt; components needed for conventional liquid fuel engines.  Scorpius </i><br>
<i>&gt; runs on Kerosene and liquid oxygen, which are both relatively cheap.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Microcosm estimates that its new rocket delivers thrust at $2.80 per </i><br>
<i>&gt; pound.  In comparison, a Rocketdyne engine of a similar size </i><br>
<i>&gt; costs $60 per pound and an Aerojet engine costs $260 per pound.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The latest test burn for the 5000 pound thrust (20,000 newton) </i><br>
<i>&gt; prototype engine took place at New Mexico Institute of Mining and </i><br>
<i>&gt; Technology in Socorro.  The prototype has 31 parts but no precision </i><br>
<i>&gt; or high-tolerance components, says Wertz.  He claims it was </i><br>
<i>&gt; assembled in less than 40 hours and cost less than $5000 to build.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet this simple engine has already been fired for 200 seconds -- </i><br>
<i>&gt; about 10 percent longer than the time needed to put a vehicle into </i><br>
<i>&gt; low Earth orbit.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The basic design includes graphite-epoxy fuel tanks, a pressurized </i><br>
<i>&gt; delivery system, rather than fuel pumps, and a simple combustion </i><br>
<i>&gt; chamber which is also made of composite materials.  Microcosm </i><br>
<i>&gt; intends to extend the design to create increasingly powerful rockets.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; With funding from the Department of Defense and NASA, it plans to </i><br>
<i>&gt; build launchers powered by several engines, each rated at 5000 </i><br>
<i>&gt; pounds thrust, then scale these up to 20.000 pounds thrust per engine.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Our eventual goal is to be able to put 170 pounds into low Earth </i><br>
<i>&gt; orbit for $750,000, and 2200 pounds for under $2 million," says </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wertz.  Providing funding continues, Microcosm hopes to launch the </i><br>
<i>&gt; first single stage rockets next year and launch to orbit within three </i><br>
<i>&gt; years.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "We have sought not to invent anything new where possible, instead </i><br>
<i>&gt; preferring to adapt existing ideas, such as thrust-vectoring based on </i><br>
<i>&gt; injecting fluid into the combustion chamber to divert the thrust, </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than mount the engine on expensive gimbals," says Wertz.  </i><br>
