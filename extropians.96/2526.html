IAN: Sometimes I have to accord myself the luxury of not<br>
documenting ever statement I make. Your questions can only<br>
be answered property from a lengthy inquiry, which it seems<br>
you've yet to begin. But here are quick answers, and they're <br>
all I've time for:<br>
<p>
(1) Poverty is measured by the inability to access resources. <br>
Laissez-faire capitalism has basically done one thing: maximize<br>
accessibility of resources as a result of free enterprise and <br>
mass production, founded upon the theory of private property. <br>
Laws do not and cannot reduced poverty, they can only spread <br>
it around. <br>
<p>
(2) Homelessness is measured as a condition in which the supply <br>
of available housing falls below demand. Price controls, such as <br>
rent controls, are universally correlated to this phenomenon.<br>
Such cantorls are vioaltions of laissez-faire markets.<br>
<p>
(3) The penal system overload is a direct result of violations <br>
of Laissez-faire capitalism, specifically, free trade in drugs.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt;some people don't win in a market economy</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; simply because each individual is</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; compelled to serve the consumer, the people, or suffer material</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; privations. Privations which would not exceed those suffered had</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; the individual chosen to forgo human association altogether, and</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; therefore such privations cannot be measured as an initiation of harm.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; i don't understand.  are you saying that someone who "suffers material</i><br>
<i> &gt; privation" (aka Poverty), deserves it.  Is the market equivalent of</i><br>
<i> &gt; an outcaste or hermit ??</i><br>
<p>
IAN: It's not a matter of "deserves," it's a matter of fact. <br>
If I receive no votes, nobody voted for me, ipso facto. Did I <br>
"deserve" no votes? I guess the whole of the people thought so. <br>
<p>
You see, the position you hold stands at odds with the will of <br>
the people. If people don't want to vote for someone, the redist-<br>
ributionist will force people to vote for them. That's why the <br>
redistributors instinctively seek to marshal the weaponry of <br>
the State to force their neighbors against the threat of physical <br>
violence to serve their will and to distribute their resources <br>
according to their plans. I think people do not deserve that.<br>
<p>
The allocation of votes -- capital -- should be <br>
directed by choice not force. That's democracy.<br>
