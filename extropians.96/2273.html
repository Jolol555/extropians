<i>&gt;IAN: I'm not sure exactly how this ties in but, having fairly </i><br>
<i>&gt;extensive lucid dream experience -- where, while asleep you </i><br>
<i>&gt;"wake up" in your dream to realize, "Like woh, I'm dreaming, gee,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is cool" -- up to the point of willful lucid state induction, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I've observed the amazing phenomenon that one can, in the sleeping </i><br>
<i>&gt;dream state, have a set of memories that even upon careful review </i><br>
<i>&gt;appear to be 100% accurate and true to your non asleep life, yet </i><br>
<i>&gt;upon waking are seen to in fact have been 100% false.</i><br>
<p>
I think i know how this ties in. What is it like to be a non self-aware<br>
individual? It should be like being in a dream where you're only a passive<br>
observer and then when the lucidity kicks in after 2 years of life, you're<br>
then able to realize things and make choices for yourself. I myself have<br>
had dreams where I had sets of memories in the dream only to wakeup and<br>
realize they were entirely false. Dreams also add to chaos and confusion<br>
when you try to remember events in your past which were actually dreams and<br>
never actually occurred. I have had dreams merge with my real memory upon<br>
waking up. Perhaps this is some sort of sleep disorder? I've had some of<br>
those spontaneously prefabricated dream memories grafted into my real<br>
memory bank and thus create confusion. One example is I've woken up and<br>
thought to myself, "Hey I just dreamed a continuation of a dream I'd had<br>
before" when I hadn't. This can sound confusing just talking about it. I<br>
_really wish_ I could have more lucid dreams! I only have them when I'm<br>
sick with a cold or flu and thats even rare. Although usually any dreams of<br>
mine are _so bizarre_ to be incomprehensible to descramble and discover<br>
their psychological meaning. Also have you noticed that whenever you see<br>
printed words in a dream every time you look away and look back they say<br>
something different? Also through studying computer graphics and virtual<br>
reality and watching such computer graphics videos such as "Beyond The<br>
Mind's Eye" my dreams, when I _do_ have them are _extremely_ vivid with<br>
rotating camera angles, panning, etc, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'll write </i><br>
<i>&gt;something down on this dreamland pad of paper, hay, the letters </i><br>
<i>&gt;I just wrote are changing before my eyes</i><br>
<p>
Exactly! What causes this phenomenon?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course, logically, this must draw into question the </i><br>
<i>&gt;reality of any mental phenomena, opennng the door to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;ideation that everyting is a dream, or less to 100% true.</i><br>
<p>
Scary idea that our world isn't as predictable as we might have thought.<br>
