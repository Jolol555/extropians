Iridium will deliver services composed of baseline 2,400 bps channels.  The<br>
standard voice call will employ two concatenated channels (4,800 bps --<br>
will probably sound mechanical) and will cost about $3.00 per minute.  I<br>
suppose Internet access could be provided by concatenating four channels<br>
(9,600 bps), but it's hard to imagine who would pay for it.  (Someone else<br>
said 14 kbps -- even harder to imagine.)  Instead, I think they will sell<br>
text messaging (perhaps using a shared 2,400 bps channel) as an optional<br>
service for corporate customers.<br>
<p>
Yes, Teledesic plans to support 18 inch dish antennas.  I have visited them<br>
and interviewed CEO Russell Daggett.  They are going after corporate<br>
customers, not consumers.  The ideal customer is a company that wants to<br>
set up a factory in a developing country with inadequate telecomm<br>
facilities.<br>
<p>
The one LEO that is defintely going after consumers is Orbcomm.  This will<br>
be a global, two-way paging system.  They are looking at hikers and<br>
mountain climbers as one market.  They are also trying to get auto<br>
manufacturers to sell in-dash terminals that will let people signal for<br>
emergency roadside assistance.  In general, they can provide two-way<br>
messaging to rural and remote locations.  The terminals and service will be<br>
reasonably-priced (at least, last I heard).<br>
<p>
There is a small firm in St. Louis that has proposed a high-speed data<br>
service for both businesses and consumers via geosynchronous satellites.<br>
They claim their system can support up to 500,000 simultaneous T1 (1.54<br>
Mbps) connections(!)  However, I have heard there are some questions about<br>
its viability.<br>
<p>
BTW, I don't know which Hughes system is offering 400 kbps right now<br>
(according to Ray Peck), but it is not Spaceway.  It is probably older (and<br>
more expensive) VSAT technology.<br>
