Whether or not you know they have *a* secret is really immaterial. If<br>
someone publishes their company's plans for the next year and their<br>
competitors use that information to beat them then noone's likely to care<br>
that the 'open' person has a secret Pam Anderson .GIF collection. The<br>
point is that some secrets are *useful* and your social status will depend<br>
on how well you can keep the useful secrets. A completely open person will<br>
be unable to keep any secret and stuck with very low-level work.=20<br>

<i>&gt; What is a secret if not a piece of intellectual property surrounded by</i><br>

Actually, crypto-anarchy intersects this thread in an interesting manner.=<br>

On the one hand it allows people to keep their own secrets absolutely<br>
secure, yet on the other it allows anyone to spread any information with<br>
no possibility of physical retribution. So it's a society where secrets<br>
are secret, but as soon as anyone finds out your secret you can't keep it<br>
secret any longer. A strange combination of complete privacy and complete<br>
openness; the biggest problem in such a society would not be keeping<br>
secrets, but determining what revealed information is actually true.<br>
=20<br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but if the eventual effects of the secret are never felt by anyone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the advantage to having the secret was nullified. If they are felt,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the secret can be inferred.</i><br>
<p>
How? Suppose I have inside information that allows me to make a 100:1<br>
profit on the futures market. You accuse me of insider trading, but I can<br>
point to all the surveillance cameras and point out that you have a=20<br>
complete record of my actions and I was just lucky.<br>

<i>&gt; Ooh, I just had a flash. Perhaps Brin=92s</i><br>
<i>&gt; world has people accusing each other of holding secrets the way people</i><br>

<p>
Or as innocent people today are anonymously accused of dealing drugs... of<br>
course they will.=20<br>
