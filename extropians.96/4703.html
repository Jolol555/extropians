Thanks a lot for your story, Anders. It resembles the new direction of <br>
Moravec's thinking more than a bit: he speaks of an transformation wave <br>
(phase transition, to the next vacuum) flooding back from the outer <br>
layers of the expanding noosphere light cone, overwhelming the "mindless <br>
depths" of the nucleation. He actually argues that it is has happened <br>
already, that, unawares, we have been transformed, way in the past.<br>
<p>
I do not see how this can be a scientific theory. It has chilled me <br>
slightly to find out that vacuum decay is not just a concept occuring in <br>
cellular automata runs (and in science fiction), but an actual physical <br>
event (according to hyperspace theory, currently sole TOE candidate, <br>
primeval symmetry breaking, causing most of spatial dimensions to <br>
collapse to the Planck scale and created our universe (as we know it) was <br>
such a phase transition). It would be _extremely_ interesting to find <br>
out, whether our current vacuum is truly the ground state, and not yet <br>
another local minimum. I now understand why the quest of calculating the <br>
true vacuum (Michio Kaku, "Strings, Conformal Fields, and Topology") <br>
might be more than a confirmation/knockout criterion of the theory.<br>
<p>
We're living in truly interesting times.<br>
