This recent trend is nice, and gives us more breathing space, but I<br>
don't think we should pin too many hopes on it.  There are<br>
subpopulations of rich countries with large birth rates, and over the<br>
long term they should come to dominate.  You might pin more hopes on <br>
the idea the soon our economic growth rate may exceed any feasible<br>
population growth rate, given the familiar technology of having<br>
babies.  But with uploads, this limit should go away.<br>
