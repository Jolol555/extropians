<i>&gt;Yes, but do you know what that gene therapy does? It changes *one* gene</i><br>
<i>&gt;making *one* protein.</i><br>
<p>
True but the closest we've gotten to nano are molecular steam engines,<br>
wires, and moving around atoms to spell words. Hell I'd love a moniter with<br>
the resolution of atoms! Not insulting nano or anything but it just seems<br>
closer to reality than nano<br>
due to the unimaginable possibilies that nano will unfold perhaps?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What you propose is</i><br>
<i>&gt;roughly to create a customized multicellular lifeform,</i><br>
<p>
What was the geep (goat+sheep) and glowing tobacco plant (firefly gene) all<br>
about?<br>
We should begin by looking to viruses as you suggested or bacterium.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;genetics may </i><br>
<i>&gt;turn out the be the easiest way towards nano.</i><br>
<p>
I'm betting on this one and I have lots of friends going into the field of<br>
genetic engineering so I'm hoping to get the beta uploading kit before it<br>
goes mainstream! :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I object to is your claim that this bio-uploading is simpler than </i><br>
<i>&gt;doing it with nano; both proposals are very hard and will require </i><br>
<i>&gt;enormous advances.</i><br>
<p>
Obviously but I was merely saying that we are already getting real world<br>
experience with genetic engineering when we're still creating the tools for<br>
nano although you _could_ say certain microsurgeries are close to being<br>
called nano experience but not really.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;:-) No, what I was thinking of was using something like a rabies virus, </i><br>
<i>&gt;that spreads from synapse to synapse, and instead of killing the cell </i><br>
<i>&gt;turning them into a part of your uploading organism from the inside </i><br>
<i>&gt;instead of from the outside.</i><br>
<p>
Good idea! Engineer the organism to have a membrane or something around it<br>
which transforms each individual neuron into the uploading organism from<br>
the inside out and transforms the neuron into one of the organism's cells<br>
or should I say 'pointer' cell which points to the location of a specific<br>
piece of data inside the computer. I'm not so keen on your mushy brain idea<br>
though. :) Also perhaps we can learn from Canaries which can repair and<br>
grow new neurons and learn how to slowly convert the brain to a new type of<br>
easily uploadable neuron.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Uploading though letal disease, anyone? :-)</i><br>
<p>
ohhh! Sounds appealing! :) Then again no one said uploading was risk free.<br>
