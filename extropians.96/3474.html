&lt;&lt; Note:  This letter was originally written in response to the Star<br>
Trek fundraising suggestion, but, I was later informed, never made it to<br>
the mailing list.  I am therefore reposting it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The bit about fundraising at Star-Trek conventions is impractical,<br>
inadequate, but at least it's something. Still, I don't think we should<br>
accept unearned gold at this point. Any serious push for the Singularity<br>
should be funded by venture capital (if the venture has short-term<br>
possibilities) or by a single rich veteran of the short-term pushes (if<br>
it's a purely long-term thing or something too dangerous for venture<br>
capital); anything else is just *asking* to become a cult.<br>
<p>
Think of your job at this point as the laying of groundwork. At one<br>
point, someone with major money will be stricken by a vision of the<br>
Singularity, or someone with a vision of the Singularity will succeed in<br>
building up funding. Maybe me. Maybe you. Maybe that Netscape guy,<br>
Andersson or something. The point is, I'd like to see complete action<br>
plans for all levels of funding between $10^5 and $10^10.<br>
<p>
I'd like to see frequently updated, ready-to-use lists of all major<br>
researchers involved in Singularity-oriented research, their current<br>
salaries and funding situation, how much good some additional funding<br>
could do and the potentialities for short-term profits.<br>
<p>
I'd like to see lists of all the venture capital that would be<br>
interested in funding Singularity-oriented ventures, with specialties,<br>
generosity and control-freakness clearly indicated by business records<br>
and interviews with former partners.<br>
<p>
In other words, what I would like to see is a completely laid out plan<br>
that can be polished in advance of anyone with the ability to implement<br>
it. I don't want idealistic plans for a fan club that will someday rule<br>
the Earth; I want hard figures. I want an analysis of the legal problems<br>
faced by foundations, corporations, Internet-coordinated public<br>
conspiracies, and any combination thereof.<br>
<p>
Show the names of Extropian CEOs, CPAs and (shudder) lawyers who could<br>
keep a corporation running. Put everything into place that can be put<br>
into place with a little research, a little experience, some advice from<br>
more experienced friends and access to the Net version of the Wall<br>
Street Journal. As a start, you might want to try and form a group of<br>
Extropian businessfolk who could form such a plan as a hobby. If there<br>
are no Extropians who can run a corporation, that's a major roadblock<br>
that we can start solving now. I don't care about MBAs, but if NONE of<br>
us know how to do this, some of us better learn. I've read "Start Up" by<br>
(I think) Jerry Kaplan, a story of a pen-computers company which was<br>
killed by Microsoft, which seems like a nice place to start. <br>
<p>
You could be hit either by a really bright idea or by a lot of money.<br>
Have detailed enough preparations in place for both, and one or the<br>
other will soon come along. You may not be rich, but there are some<br>
things you can do, and one of them is planning.<br>
<p>
This is not a call to arms; do not send *me* email volunteering for the<br>
project. Someone else save this document and gather the Procedure<br>
Preparation People. After Triple-P gets a basic plan set up, I can stomp<br>
it to shreds looking for logical flaws and then spin the tattered<br>
fragments into something that works, but I can't start Triple-P itself.<br>
That's a project, and a project requires a plan. I can't handle long<br>
linear causal sequences well enough to formulate one, for reasons<br>
explained in "Algernon's Law", the second Web page in my signature.<br>
<p>
Even if I get hit by a truck, though, it might still be a good idea to<br>
have a plan in place. One, it will get you thinking along the right<br>
paths, practical ones. Two, you may go through the planning procedure<br>
and find at the end that your plan requires neither money nor a<br>
brilliant idea, in which case you may proceed to actually implement it.<br>
Three, all kinds of interesting facts pop up when you think practically;<br>
we may wish to know about them. Four, if we don't think it out in<br>
advance, we will screw up. Five, having a framework in place will ground<br>
all the conversations around here and make them much more interesting,<br>
in the same way that science is more interesting than philosophy. Six,<br>
building the plan will give everyone involved experience working<br>
together on an Extropian project; this may be important later.<br>
<p>
What needs to be planned? Let's say I want to start a corporation<br>
devoted to building AI interfaces to applications. It's<br>
Singularity-oriented because it will be developing AI that can be used<br>
to organize scientific knowledge, and because the founders will be using<br>
their gains to fund other ventures. Part one. Where do I start? Look for<br>
venture capital? Write a business plan? Build a prototype? If I look for<br>
venture capital, who should I go to? How much venture capital can I<br>
expect and how many programmers can I hire with it? What types of fame<br>
and/or credentials will impress venture capitalists? Which is most<br>
impressive: A doctorate, having published a book on the subject, five<br>
years of experience, winning a prize within the field, or being<br>
world-renowned for something? Are any of the above absolutely necessary?<br>
This, you understand, to see if I need a figurehead and if so, what<br>
kind.<br>
<p>
Where can I get advice? Where can I get advice on whether my bright idea<br>
is any good - without, of course, giving the bright idea away? There<br>
must be ten thousand books on how to start your own business. 90% of<br>
them will be worthless. Does anyone have a list of the top ten? No sense<br>
in duplicating effort; some of the step-by-step guides will already be<br>
done.<br>
<p>
Think practical, practical, practical. Let's all remember that we don't<br>
care about what happens after the Singularity because IT'S NOT OUR<br>
PROBLEM. Sure, I wrote an entire Web page about the Beyondness of the<br>
Powers. But that was for the benefit of my fellow humans and was<br>
intended to settle the issue by impressing all concerned on how *futile*<br>
that kind of speculation was. <br>
<p>
Also, I tried to include arguments that were not just impressive but<br>
scientifically informative. How to set up a Power with numeric intuition<br>
is a problem that we, unaided humans, may need to solve before the<br>
Powers take over. Not exactly a practical problem for the near future,<br>
but it's something about which thought may be useful, especially since<br>
it might be adaptable to a modern, non-Power CAD station or something.<br>
<p>
We aren't going to get to the Singularity by singing hosannas to Powers<br>
that won't even exist unless we do something! Start planning!<br>
