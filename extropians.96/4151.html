I recently read a book called _Body and Soul_, dealing with the concept of <br>
healthy sexuality.  The author , Anne Stirling Hastings, discusses at length <br>
her conception of natural sexuality and the many things that get in its way <br>
in our culture.  I found many of her ideas enlightening but I am left with <br>
some unresolved questions that I consider important.<br>
<p>
Hastings describes natural sexuality as a type of emotional energy that is <br>
available and controllable.  She claims that nearly all problems with sex <br>
are a result of a society that inhibits the  natural expression of sexuality. <br>
She then paints a picture of what natural sexuality would be like.  Some <br>
of her conceptions include: free expression of sexuality by children with <br>
adults looking on approvingly but not responding with their own sexuality;  <br>
free sexual exploration by children and teenagers among their peers; the <br>
development of trial pair bonds that  do not work out well enough to <br>
maintain;  the eventual formation of strong monogamous sexual bonds that <br>
eliminate the desire to flirt outside the relationship.<br>
<p>
I am persuaded by her arguments and can see how the situation she describes <br>
is indeed in line with the biology and natural inclination of at least a <br>
segment of the population.  However, just because something is natural or <br>
feels right does not mean it is the most practical thing to do.   Given my <br>
interest in living as long as I can and enjoying myself as much as I can, I <br>
am interested in forming the best relationships I can and managing my <br>
sexuality in ways that serve my goals.  What are reasonable guidelines for <br>
the productive use of sexuality?  <br>
<p>
Sexuality is a hormonal state, so it is very much like a mind-altering drug.  <br>
I have nothing against the recreational use of drugs, but I am aware that <br>
they can be used in ways that are detrimental.   Hastings claims that <br>
most people use sex in ways that numb their minds and deprive them of the <br>
greater pleasure that can be obtained by a strong monogamous bonding.  She <br>
believes flirting, affairs, multiple relationships, pornography, fantasy, <br>
etc.,  weaken the bonding of couples and are engaged in because of sexual <br>
damage experienced during childhood.  <br>
<p>
So here are my questions.  Is it good to flirt?  Is the heightened sexual <br>
energy that results something that can be channeled productively, a <br>
pleasant feeling that does no harm, or a needless distraction that <br>
interferes with people relating to people in more worthwhile ways?  <br>
Is it good to use sexual energy to intentionally form bonds with selected <br>
people (or for that matter anyone you like)?  Is it good to use sexual <br>
stimulation to enhance one’s work efforts?  Is a strong monogamous bond <br>
something to be avoided because it relies too much on one person; would it <br>
be better to build multiple bonds?  Would those bonds of necessity be <br>
weaker?  How practical is sexual bonding for small groups; can human <br>
biology allow such bonds to be as strong as pair bonds?  Are there other <br>
sorts of bonds that would be more appropriate?  Would it be best to use <br>
sexuality to form bonds with anyone who has common goals (and is willing <br>
to be sexual) or is sexuality something best reserved for only a few?  Does <br>
it make sense to use sexuality to persuade, barter, etc.?  Am I thinking<br>
about this too much? :-)<br>
<p>
The book also brings up some other eye-opening ideas about sexuality:<br>
* Heterosexual men sneak in sexual behavior with other men.  <br>
* Most people require unhealthy ritualize behaviors to avoid sexual shame.<br>
* Legislating sexuality does just the opposite of what people intend.  <br>
* Lust interferes with healthy sexuality.<br>
* A sex drive is really a sex addiction.  <br>
* Sexual behavior is very common but people often deny it.   <br>
* People respond sexually to many things that only resemble sex in some way.  <br>
* Many  women are sexual with their children in destructive ways.  <br>
* Romance is just another form of sexual addiction.  <br>
* Our societies gender roles are the first cause of these sexual problems.<br>
<p>
_Body and Soul_ did a lot to expand my understanding of human sexuality <br>
and our culture (at least I think it did; I’ll have to watch myself and <br>
others for a while to see if the theories pan out) but I certainly do not <br>
agree with the author on every point.  If anyone would be so kind as to <br>
recommend other books that give good insight into human sexuality and <br>
bonding relationships I would appreciate it.  I hate to hear only one <br>
side of an argument and I think that I would benefit from a better <br>
understanding of human sexuality.<br>
