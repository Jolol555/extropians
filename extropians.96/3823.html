From: "David Musick" &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Hal Finney paraphrases David Brin: "Encryption must be banned!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is impossible to ban encryption, at least not the really good stuff, </i><br>
<i>&gt; because you don't even know the encryption is there; the message looks like </i><br>
<i>&gt; any other message.  That's the whole *point* of cryptography.  By its very </i><br>
<i>&gt; nature it will be secret and undetectable without the proper knowledge, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; is also secret.</i><br>
<p>
As I mentioned, David Brin did follow his rather startling comment with<br>
some practical qualifications based on the kinds of considerations that<br>
David Musick mentions.  He recognizes that in actuality it is not possible<br>
to detect all forms of encryption.  However he suggests that there still<br>
would be value in having some kind of legal or financial penalty for<br>
the use of crypto, so that it is not used routinely, but only for the<br>
exceptional message.<br>
<p>
You could still imagine a world in which massive encryption is going on,<br>
hidden behind all the music videos and corporate spreadsheets which are<br>
floating through the nets.  But I think Brin is right that laws against<br>
encryption would succeed in greatly reducing its use.<br>
<p>
I see this as a bad result, because I suspect that it would only increase<br>
the distinction between conspiring criminals, who would certainly hide<br>
their messages, and ordinary people, who would be more out in the open<br>
and vulnerable than ever.  I'm not sure what the impact would be on the<br>
intellectual property problem; perhaps it would be more effective in<br>
that regard.  But generally, rather than leveling the playing field,<br>
it would make it more lopsided.  That is why I have worked for many<br>
years to try to increase the availability of crypto tools for the masses.<br>
