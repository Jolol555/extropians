Max MOre asks,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do you really think the software market would function better if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;government decided what products could be made, by whom, and how</i><br>
<i>&gt;much they could be sold for?</i><br>
<p>
Certainly not!<br>
But I resent being presented with a forced-choice between 20'th<br>
century "free market" capitalist "democracy" and Soviet-style<br>
state socialism (state capitalism, some would say).<br>
<p>
I am in favor of decentralization, and am interested in the possibility<br>
of new social/cultural systems emerging which lack both the centralized<br>
control of the Soviet system and the centralized corporate control<br>
of the current US system.<br>
<p>
I understand that the expansion of something like Microsoft software<br>
is a natural phenomenon -- it's what the economists call "increasing<br>
returns" (rather than the textbook "decreasing returns").  The more<br>
you sell, the more you gain "mind share" as well as market share,<br>
and the more other software vendors write software only compatible<br>
with your stuff.  Positive feedback!!  <br>
<p>
The spread of MicroSoft software is much like the spread of a<br>
foreign bacterium in the human body.  A healthy body has an immune<br>
system which keeps any substance (internal or external) from rising<br>
to an excessive level.  One can imagine a social system which had similar<br>
internal, self-organizing mechanisms acting to keep things decentralized,<br>
