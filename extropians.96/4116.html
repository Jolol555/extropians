My point exactly (I know, it's not what you intended, but I like it anyway).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's not to be taken seriously.</i><br>

<p>
However (to paraphrase), "One can die as surely from a million pinpricks<br>
as from a single sword thrust.".  I get plenty of junk mail from random<br>
ad agencies -- et tu, Chris?  (Max, actually, in case he's still following<br>
this.)<br>
<p>
The danger in the snowball and all chain letters is their exponential<br>
nature.  The note isn't just sent to 100 people and back -- it's sent to<br>
"everybody you know".  I personally could make it to over 1000 people<br>
easily -- I wonder how many each of them can reach?  Follow that exponential<br>
growth curve out a few steps and the traffic could become dizzying, and<br>
well-connected people could end up getting dozens of copies without sending<br>
out a single one -- no wonder chain letters have such a bad rep!  Some<br>
net.gurus I know have been predicting the meltdown of the Internet backbones<br>
for a while now (apparently it's already started) -- this sort of thing<br>
certainly doesn't help matters.<br>
