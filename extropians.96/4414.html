<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This is a classic case of opposing forces which find a dynamic<br>
equilibrium (or, in a continuous time chaotic system, produces a strange<br>
attractor.) Therefore you are not arguing against the relative stability<br>
of the transparency values of this variable in our chaotic system, but<br>
that this "stable" range can never be reached. Your argument to that end<br>
proceeds as follows:    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In Anti-Brin's world if it is discovered that I do NOT have a secret, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumed I that I am a fool and have no chance of being financially successful,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am ridiculed and held in contempt. This is certainly a disadvantage, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the situation is made even worse because you know all about my plans and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know nothing about yours, and this is a double disadvantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
First,<br>
<p>
I question the ability of the people of Anti-Brin to determine that you<br>
do NOT have a secret. I maintain (and so do you) that a secret can be<br>
held secret up until it is acted upon.<br>
<p>
If they went about holding those that were so private that the fact that<br>
they had secrets was a secret (as per your analysis of secrets exiting<br>
even in Brin’s World) in scorn, then they would be scorning the most<br>
subtle of the population. Not a safe thing to have been doing when their<br>
secrets were finally acted upon.<br>
<p>
A person who had no secrets would not be scorned, but more likely<br>
admired by those assuming (because of the nature of the prevailing meme<br>
structures) that everyone had secrets, and that his were just especially<br>
well hidden. Perhaps they would elect him to be there leader. Did you<br>
ever see the Peter Sellers movie "Being There"?<br>
<p>
Second,<br>
<p>
An interesting additional counter force to secrecy occurs in Anti-Brin.<br>
With total secrecy, as Brin pointed out, one loses accountability. And<br>
accountability is one of the reasons people keep secrets. If you tell<br>
someone a secret, and he deems that it is in his best interest to tell<br>
others (because they will pay him for it, or for some other reason), one<br>
thing that might keep him from doing so is that he is accountable to<br>
you. He risks your anger, or at the very least your failure to share<br>
future secrets with him. The old phrase "A secret shared is no longer a<br>
secret" applies in a much greater way in Anti-Brin where total privacy<br>
makes the odds of your discovering that someone has betrayed you<br>
approach zero.<br>

What is a secret if not a piece of intellectual property surrounded by<br>
metaphorical barbed wire?<br>

<i>&gt; to you and me and nobody else. There are ways I can prove that I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain piece of secret information without giving you the slightest clue as</i><br>

<i>&gt; only don't know what I'm saying you don't even know who I'm talking to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are ways of using Steganography so you not only don't know who I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking to, you don't even know I'm talking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but if the eventual effects of the secret are never felt by anyone,<br>
then the advantage to having the secret was nullified. If they are felt,<br>
then the secret can be inferred. Ooh, I just had a flash. Perhaps Brin’s<br>
world has people accusing each other of holding secrets the way people<br>
were once accused of witch-craft! There’s no proof, but the cow’s milk<br>
did curdle for no apparent reason! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It just keeps sounding better and better.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed. I think we have just talked me out of any possibility of<br>
supporting such a thing. Lets see:<br>
<p>
If secrecy becomes not normal, then tolerance of other normal behavior<br>
increases, and tolerance of abnormal behavior increases because it can<br>
be easily seen to cause no harm. Secrecy itself, however, is an abnormal<br>
behavior, the effects of which can not be easily seen, so it is feared.<br>
Since secrets, by nature of being secret, are not easily detectable<br>
people will end up fearing secrets irrationally where none exist and<br>
chance successes or failures will be blamed on secrets. (What is chance,<br>
after all, but an illusion caused by an inability to be able to perceive<br>
all the relevant information acting on a system?) Less successful people<br>
will persecute the successful (well, that happens now) as holders of<br>
secrets thus reducing their success.<br>
<p>
It still looks stable to me, but its pretty horrifying in a lot of<br>
ways..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The real question is not whether a transparent society is</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;possible but whether it is "better or worse." [...] In fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;personally, I find the whole transparency meme pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;abhorrent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure why were arguing. Whether Brin's world is possible or not is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective question, whether it would be nice or not is subjective. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; nauseates me but your mileage may vary, at any rate, I worry about it about</i><br>
<i>&gt; as much as I worry that gravity will reverse direction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Your right, were arguing  the objective here, but I am using the process<br>
as a means of trying to shed light on the subjective; at least for<br>
myself.<br>
<p>
Were arguing partially because I think Brin’s world, or something close<br>
to what we are calling Brin’s world is possible and you don’t -<br>
partially because if it is possible, I would like to see if it can be<br>
"good" (I don’t think it can, but I’m more than a little concerned about<br>
the lack of accountability under Anti-Brin as well) - and partially<br>
because I just like to argue. (Arguing the other side would equally well<br>
serve my purposes for being here.)<br>
