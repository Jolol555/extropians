<i>&gt;Intrinsic goal: get some honey. Why? Because you just happen to want some</i><br>
<i>&gt;honey.</i><br>
<p>
But that's just hiding things under the rug.  Let's play a little harder:<br>
<p>
Intrinsic goal: get some honey. Why? Because I just happen to want<br>
some honey.  Why?  Because ...  er ..., gee, I have this mental state<br>
that says I desire honey.  Why?  Well, either the mental state is a<br>
stupid mistake arising from general mental flakeyness (and the desire<br>
for honey is therefore a stupid goal), or the mental state has some<br>
valid cause outside of itself, such as evolution plus a need for<br>
calories or nutritional completeness or some such.  Why?  Well, I need<br>
calories or nutritional completeness so I can stay alive and healthy.<br>
So now the goal has become either extrinsic or stupid, right?<br>
<p>
If we call it extrinsic, we should take the trouble to remember the<br>
original thing that made us want to call it intrinsic -- the emotion<br>
with which it was held.  It's the emotion that makes satisfying the<br>
goal non-drudgery; I don't think it is important that the emotion is<br>
the ultimate justification of the action.  Emotions are quite<br>
flexible, so it is very risky to use them as an ultimate<br>
justification.<br>
<p>
Quite often people think a goal is somehow "true" if you don't know<br>
where it came from.  This is quite analogous with Christians who think<br>
that Faith is good simply because there is no rational reason to do<br>
it.  Yuck.  I prefer extrinsic goals, since IMO the allegedly<br>
intrinsic ones are either stupid goals or are really extrinsic goals<br>
that are not well-understood.  Calling them intrinsic stops the<br>
understanding.  Among non-philosophers, intrinsic goals are called<br>
"fun".  These are the frivolous goals Lyle was talking about.<br>
<p>
Having fun is okay, but don't use it to justify your actions.<br>
