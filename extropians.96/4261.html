<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
The force drops to nothing almost immediately.  The Casimir force is closely<br>
related to the zero point field physics I discussed a month or two ago.  As<br>
you mentioned previously in this thread it is a quantum mechanical effect.<br>
The measured force is actually the repulsion between<br>
"virtual"(Heisenberg-ish) electrons.<br>
<p>
Here is how it works:<br>
<p>
Quantum mechanics describes electrons as occupying a probability space as<br>
opposed to having deterministic locations (Heisenberg uncertainty principle<br>
and Schroedinger among others).  The probability curve is such that there is<br>
an astronomically small, but finite, probability that one of the electrons<br>
in your body is quite possibly occupying the space in front of me as you<br>
read this.  <br>
<p>
The Casimir force is a manifestation of these electrons popping up and<br>
disappearing momentarily in space.  We are constantly emersed in a sea of<br>
these virtual electrons, but the density increases with proximity to mass.<br>
The more mass, the denser the field.  Consider the non-conductive parallel<br>
plates used to demonstrate the Casimir force.  You have two plates in very<br>
close proximity to each other.  So close, in fact, that the probability of<br>
an electron popping into existence is considerably higher between the plates<br>
than the probability of an electron emerging outside of the two plates.  The<br>
probability is higher because at the distances involved, both plates are<br>
generating significant quantities of these virtual electrons due to the<br>
proximity of the space to the plate.  The net result is that the<br>
concentration of electrons in the space between the plates is significantly<br>
higher than the concentration on the outside of the plates, due to<br>
significant overlap of the electron density curves.  This generates a<br>
repulsive force due to electron interaction between the plates that is<br>
larger than the repulsive force generated on the outside of the plates where<br>
the electron density is less.<br>
<p>
Hope this makes sense.  If not, I can elaborate.<br>
