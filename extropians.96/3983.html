It of course depends on your ethical system; animals do eat animals, and <br>
animal meat is part of our original diet. We can choose to be vegitarian <br>
or not, but there is no "natural" reason for it.<br>
<p>
I can see some valid reasons for vegitarianism:<br>
<p>
1 Meat is unaesthetic, against your religion, culture or values (I.e your<br>
memes doesn't allow it)<br>
<p>
2 Meat is inefficient to produce, and thus wastes too much valuable<br>
resources (this suggests that lower forms of life like insects and fish<br>
would be acceptable since they can be bred more efficiently). This view<br>
may or may not be relevant on Earth right now, but it would be very<br>
reasonable in an O'Neill colony or smiliar small biosphere. <br>
<p>
3 Eating meat reduces the complexity of the world somewhat, so "higher" <br>
animals should be avoided (are there plants more complex than animals?). <br>
This is really a sub-version of 1, where the meme is "complexity is good". <br>
<p>
Myself, I tend towards eating little meat, but have recently begun to try <br>
to eat more of it since I think I need somewhat more protein. I agree <br>
somewhat with 3 and 2. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was also thinking about the idea of farming humans to eat.  Humans are </i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive to feed, and they take several years to mature, but if someone </i><br>
<i>&gt; really enjoyed human meat, is there anything wrong with farming them?</i><br>
<p>
A modest proposal? :-) I think it is a bad idea on purely medical grounds <br>
- if you eat the meat of humans you can get human diseases from it, while <br>
the meat of other species usually is safe. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, I'm certainly not advocating any of these activities, but I think it's </i><br>
<i>&gt; important to think about and discuss why we do or don't think various </i><br>
<i>&gt; activities are "wrong".  Is it possible to have a system of "rational ethics"? </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Would it be based totally on achieving one's goals, or is there more to </i><br>
<i>&gt; ethics than that?</i><br>
<p>
I think an ethics has to be useful to be good (but of couse, ethical<br>
syustems, being memes, will try to spread anyway): it has to provide you,<br>
and presumably others, with some benefit. The classic "nice ethic" (love <br>
others as you love yourself, do not harm, steal, lie etc) provides a <br>
practical framework for a society by reducing internal competiton and the <br>
risk for backstabbing (although it is vulnerable to exploitation; this is <br>
why rules have always liked "Slavenmoral" among their underlings).<br>
<p>
I think it is quite possible to design a rational ethics, given some<br>
social and mental preconditions (is it intended for one person, a society,<br>
the whole world, are people rational?), perhaps by applying game theory,<br>
memetics and computer simulations (like running genetic algorithms to<br>
develop an ethical system). It would make a very interesting project, one<br>
which I have wanted to work on for a long time. <br>
