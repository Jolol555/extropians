Are you sure about this? If the physical needs and desires align with <br>
what you want to conquer, you will be very good at it and enjoy the trip <br>
too. Imagine linking your pleasure center to some way of measuring your <br>
evolution.<br>

<p>
We humans are embodied, physical beings with a lot of emotional baggage - <br>
we *are* our bodies in some sense. So far all realistic uploading <br>
scenarios have simply dealt with copying the neurochemical pattern of us <br>
into a digital emulation, where we continue to live as emulated physical <br>
beings (who of course now can start to automorph very freely - who needs <br>
physical continuity?). <br>
<p>
We wont immediately become "pure intellect" - that doesn't exist, at least<br>
no human or human-derived intellect can work without emotion, motivation<br>
circuits and plenty of brainstem processing (you don't want to loose your<br>
superior colliculus or habenula when you upload). Without these parts we<br>
would simply not function well, and be less (effectively) intelligent. We<br>
might change ourself into posthuman beings with completely new such<br>
structures, but that will take plenty of work. <br>
