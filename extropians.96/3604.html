Chuck Moore (of Forth fame) still programs in this way. At iTV they had <br>
to deassemble a large application (a circuit simulator) he wrote entirely <br>
using his crazy octakey (not hexapod) input scheme. This very nontrivial <br>
application (he uses it to develop his i21/F21 chips, since the <br>
commerical simulators produce only digital barfics if let loose upon his <br>
designs) never had any source. (Why do you think his old company did run <br>
by the name "Computer Cowboys"? Yeeeehaw!)<br>

<p>
Current RISCs have become finicky as formula1 cars. They either break <br>
the sonic barrier, or, break down. Nothing else in between. Gcc is very <br>
good at producing terrible Alpha AXP code (while running like molasses <br>
during compilation), while handcrafted assembly runs like a fox (orders <br>
over orders) on the same problem/machine. Hang compilers.<br>
<p>
I predict radical simplification of the CPUs, down to the scale of few 10 <br>
kTransistors (only the core, not the RAM) due to their drastically better <br>
price/performance ratio (especially memory bandwidth) and the obvious need <br>
to go WSI (wafer-scale integration) quite soon.<br>
<p>
1) CPU dies must cost in the 1-50 $ range for maspar applications<br>
2) complex dies are dear, both because of design and yield issues<br>
3) bad die yield goes up exponentially with die size<br>
4) WSI needs a relatively high percentile (50%) of viable dies<br>
5) WSI demolishes cutting, packaging, testing in one fell swoop, and <br>
   offers small bus geometries and good memory bandwidth since<br>
6) on-die accesses are orders of magnitude faster and burn much less <br>
   juice due to absence of signal up/downscaling<br>
<p>
Corollaries:<br>
<p>
1) CPUs will become _very_ simple, see MISC.( I doubt InTeL will pioneer <br>
   this, though they sure will join the party, once it has started. I <br>
   don't know what M$ might or might not do...)<br>
2) RAM grains will be small 128...512 kBytes due to yield reasons, <br>
   ergo <br>
3) OSses will feature handcrafted nanokernels (10-20 kByte) and<br>
4) need threaded code, requiring a on-die bi-stack architecture<br>
5) Buses will be large (128-1024 bits), and we'll have VLIW (notice how <br>
   my old predictions correlate with what you can now read in <br>
   the newer Microprocessor Reports).  <br>
6) Programming paradigm will be low-overhead asynchronous OOP, requiring <br>
7) redundant hypergrid wiring scheme to catch the dead dies due to WSI <br>
   and to offer sufficient on-wafer communication bandwidth<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; } easily abstracted.  Other applications, such as database or systems</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm.  Graphical representation of a database of records; highlight a</i><br>
<i>&gt; field to be the sort index, drag and drop "Quicksort"...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But someone had to write "Quicksort". </i><br>
<p>
For a large class of problems clean algorithmics do not exist (I'm amazed <br>
my MessagePad 130 (btw, have a look at emate300 and the next Newt (2000)) <br>
can read my scrawls most of the time, but then they use a large database <br>
with script samples for the noncontiguous script recognition). <br>
Such problems are best solved by WYWIWYG, GA-growing your code/data for <br>
fitness. Such problem solving methodologies, whether digital (a very smart <br>
RAM) or analog (VLSI ANNs, the C. Meade approach) require a dedicated <br>
architecture, being unable to run on von-Neumann (generically used) <br>
monoprocessors worth $0.02. We'll see hybrid architectures before very long.<br>

<i>&gt; } &gt;Everybody (almost) agrees that the GUI is a better way to comunicate with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt;computer than a command language. Everybody except system developers. Eh...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Around here, programmers in general, and many people who don't program</i><br>

<p>
Even a CLI is a GUI. You don't see signal levels (ok, in EM you do, but <br>
that's just another hardware GUI), do you? ;) A GUI you can't customize <br>
is useless.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; option available.</i><br>
<p>
That's the reason why Apple boxes suck (unless they run MkLinux, that <br>
is). (No, Newt does not Linux. ARM is great for Forth, though, and I <br>
wonder whether They (apage, vade retro &amp;c) have messed up him StrongARM?)<br>
