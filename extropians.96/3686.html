<i>&gt;&gt;Someone</i><br>
from the Church of the Euthanasia believes they're working for a better<br>
future, which happens to involve the reduction or extinction of the<br>
human race.  Are they extropic?  Why not?  They're pushing for a better<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Defining "better" as a dumb idea is is a dumb idea.<br>
<p>
Better doent mean some  bad idea that <br>
one "calls" better...anymore than heavier <br>
means some thing we "call" heavier...<br>
<p>
The question you posed  is "better for who?"<br>
"better than what?" NOT  "is there a better?".<br>
<p>
Better is subjective to a degree, not 100%.<br>
Juse like art is subjective to a degree, not 100%.<br>
<p>
( and BTW) I have thought it through, and they can't<br>
ONLY kill the human race...<br>
They have to eliminate ANY scrap of life and DNA, <br>
because it could EVENTUALLY evolve and become a <br>
threat...<br>
