Machines have been joining the internet for a long time, without any<br>
visible takeoff resulting.  So you must have in mind some critical<br>
number beyond which your imagined effect happens.  And visualization,<br>
decision-support, KB, etc software has been around for awhile, so you<br>
must be imagining some special effect of some as yet unseen aspect of<br>
such programs.  Both of these seem like wishful thinking to me.  <br>
