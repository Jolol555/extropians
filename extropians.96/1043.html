<i>&gt;  Commercial companies are very good at providing motivation</i><br>

<i>&gt; of ideas and effort - this seems to be a winning combination</i><br>
<i>&gt; when an idea is relatively simple and can be developed into</i><br>
<i>&gt; a product by a relatively small group of people in a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; time frame.  When one wants to design a global system that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit many diverse groups of people in the long run, then open</i><br>
<i>&gt; social discussion would appear essential.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Now, what if one tries to develop a business providing services</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a wide range of implications?  Like a new system of knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; distribution on the Net?  Is it possible to find an approach that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would promote business interests (profit, market share, security, PR,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not scaring away investors and not giving advantage to competition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.)  of the company, and at the same time involve people in</i><br>
<i>&gt; academia and general public in discussing optimal structure of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; venture and its product line, writing additional software, choice of</i><br>
<i>&gt; which parts of the sytem should remain proprietary and which should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be made open?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   I think this is a generally interesting issue - and it seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; growing in importance as more and more businesses and products become</i><br>
<i>&gt; parts of the global system. Now I also find myself quite practically</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in it, as I am working on development of Automated</i><br>
<i>&gt; Collaborative Filtering (ACF) systems for Internet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I would appreciate any general or practical ideas you may have on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subject, or references to any relevant sources.</i><br>

 hello alexander,<br>
<p>
  i know almost nothing about business and acadmia, or the global<br>
  services that will be bneficial for the whole. first i have to<br>
   say that i realy admire the altruistic feeling of the people<br>
   of wholsystm-group. and second i would like to mention that<br>
   Kirby Urner have introduced the idea of global design using<br>
   the intrenet and the latest developement which includes Java<br>
   programing language. i feel this idea is realy great, how<br>
   is it going to be set, and its total ramification is beyond me.<br>
   but it seems that it can be so inclusive to  creat even<br>
   creative zones for young people to do research and development.<br>
   on all kind of level, you might think of it as MIT global<br>
   lab(future_connected to wire magazine). i sugest that you<br>
    can contact him for some ideas; not precisly what you<br>
   are looking for, but there might be some shared ideas.<br>
<p>
   cheers tagdi <br>
<p>
   p.s i think there is some spirit of connection in<br>
       cross posting.<br>
