I wrote about a potential Transhumanist Trilogy: THE Power, Omega and the <br>
Singularity.<br>
<p>
Lyle fussed:<br>
&lt;Excuse me, but this is not poetry.  It doesn't scan.  It has no structure. <br>
 Writing prose in short lines doesn't make it into poetry.&gt;<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste warned:<br>
&lt;Once upon a time, in the extropians FAQ, I wrote "extropians have no sense <br>
of humor, none whatsoever". Of course, I intended this as a joke [snip] But <br>
then again, Lyle doesn't consider himself an extropian, so maybe he really <br>
does lack a sense of humor.&gt;<br>
<p>
However, on another recent thread, Lyle wrote:<br>
&lt;Chris, why don't you go to the L.A. airport, wearing an Extropy t-shirt or <br>
some kind of Extropian costume (use your imagination), and ask for <br>
donations?  [snip, and] One afternoon I was approached five different times <br>
by Christians who wanted me to come to a revival meeting.  The fifth time, <br>
when the guy asked me if I was a Christian, I said "No, I'm a Satanist," <br>
and a very interesting conversation ensued.&gt;<br>
<p>
Lyle hasn't lost his sense of humor - that's what parody is, twisting <br>
things out of the context they're normally seen in, just as Lyle recently <br>
asked David Musick to substitute "corporations" for "highly advanced <br>
beings" in his The Power of Symbiosis thread to see what it sounded like.<br>

&lt; Personally, I believe that there _is_ such a thing as free verse; the <br>
lines must not just be short, they must have rhythm to them.&gt;<br>
<p>
P.S. Hint for any unconverted athiests: a surprisingly similar rhythm can <br>
be heard at any Catholic mass.  Wasn't trying to be cruel or bitter though, <br>
just a playful challenge...<br>
