From: arkuat@factory.net (Eric Watt Forste)<br>
<i>&gt;Nobody worth discussing these things with really believes, deep down</i><br>
<i>&gt;inside, that the wrongness of murder is entirely subjective. To me,</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural law means the stuff that human societies have universally</i><br>
<i>&gt;found it wise to prohibit, through trial and error over the course of</i><br>
<i>&gt;history.</i><br>
<p>
I presume we agree that murder isn't part of a long term plan, since<br>
there's some risk that the potential victims will eventually organize<br>
and stop you, and there is little corresponding benefit.<br>
<p>
We evolved in circumstances where this is true, so our emotions are<br>
biased to feel this way.<br>
<p>
So I think the wrongness of murder is subjective, but that doesn't<br>
make it an arbitrary stupid premise; our subjectivity approximately<br>
obeys laws because we got where we are now by evolution.  Murder feels<br>
wrong because it is impractical and it was impractical for all of our<br>
ancestors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...Hofstadter's "superrationality" from Metamagical Themas, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;ethical skeptics have a hard time with.</i><br>
<p>
Hofstadter had to assume that perfectly rational beings should all<br>
make the same choices in the same circumstances.  This is a premise<br>
that leaps the is/ought boundary.  I don't see where he acknowledges<br>
that his premise is arbitrary, and I actually do not believe the<br>
premise.  In any case, since I'm not a perfectly rational being, I<br>
don't see any way to reliably use the premise, since it involves<br>
predicting the behavior of beings more complex than myself.  <br>
<p>
I'll have a look at the Gautier reference.<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>
