<i>&gt; advancement helping out all of humanity instead of just the rich." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First off, I also am very interested in the well-being of all humans, and also </i><br>
<i>&gt; hope that all humans benefit from technological advancement.  However, I don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; see the selfish and greedy interests of private business as conflicting in any </i><br>
<i>&gt; way with the general welfare of humanity.  In fact, I see the selfishness and </i><br>
<i>&gt; greed of the business world as the driving force of technological progress, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the provider of nearly all the wealth that we enjoy, and I think that selfish </i><br>
<i>&gt; and greedy business people are the most likely people to actually help the </i><br>
<i>&gt; poor, even though other people have much more compassion for the poor in </i><br>
<i>&gt; general.</i><br>
Really, tell that the the CEOs of Nestle and  Shell. I`m sure everybody <br>
on this list knows what these two businesses do to the Third World. face <br>
it, folks, our freedom is built on other peoples oppression. &gt; <br>
<i>&gt; First of all, a business cannot make money except by selling what people want </i><br>
<i>&gt; to buy.  So, a selfish, greedy business person, who only cares about making </i><br>
<i>&gt; lots of money is driven to provide the best products and most appealing </i><br>
<i>&gt; services in order to make lots of money.  They are in the business of </i><br>
Umm, wrong. A business is driven to make profits, not make the best <br>
product. They will cut the corners and do everything in their power to <br>
keep production costs low as long as it doesn`t undermine consumer interest. <br>
The fact that products like the electric toothbrush, disposable diapers,  are <br>
demanded by the public scares me. You`ll notice that the public is only a <br>
small minority of people, yet entire societies and ecosystems are <br>
consumed in our mad rush for more junk.<br>
<i>&gt; satisfying people's desires, and the ones who do it the best make the most </i><br>
<i>&gt; money.  But there is a great deal of competition in business, and the </i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses which are more efficient than other businesses can sell products at </i><br>
<i>&gt; lower cost than their competition while receiving the same amount of profit.</i><br>
efficiency, smefficiency. Having slave labour is very efficient, but it <br>
doesn`t help the workers any. While I don`t like union structures, they <br>
are necessary if corporations are going to be this evil. What ever <br>
happened to public conscience.  <br>
<i>&gt; Thus, they will usually tend to make more money than their competition.  Also, </i><br>
<i>&gt; those which are more efficient can provide higher quality products at the same </i><br>
<i>&gt; price as their competition and thus outsell them.  </i><br>
Assuming consumers are enlightened enough to know. This is where that <br>
tool of oppression known as mass media comes in.Advertisers can direct <br>
the news by controlling what shows they sponsor. Of course, they can <br>
dictate what the public thinks if they onw the means of communication. <br>
For example, GE owning NBC. Do you think anyone on NBC news will say <br>
anything against SDI, which benefits GE in a major way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Greedy, selfish business people are constantly driven to outdo each other in </i><br>
<i>&gt; providing higher quality, less expensive products and services.  Thus, their </i><br>
<i>&gt; greed and selfishness itself drives them to help people more than their </i><br>
<i>&gt; competition, to be better at providing people with what they desire (and </i><br>
<i>&gt; fulfilling people's desires is the best definition of "helping people" that I </i><br>
<i>&gt; know of).</i><br>
What about the people they screw over in they`re desire to become the <br>
richest fattest people possible. They screw over <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But to provide better products and services at lower prices requires making </i><br>
<i>&gt; progress in technology, improving manufacturing methods and so forth, and this </i><br>
<i>&gt; is the basic driving force behind nearly all technological progress.  Their </i><br>
<i>&gt; greed drives them to develop better technologies.  Nearly all the wealth we </i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy comes from our technology.  Even the money you are willing to pay in </i><br>
<i>&gt; taxes to help the poor exists because of the efforts of many greedy, selfish </i><br>
<i>&gt; business people.  Without all the greedy, selfish business people, we would </i><br>
<i>&gt; all be very poor indeed.  If people weren't so greedy, they wouldn't compete </i><br>
<i>&gt; so fiercely and refine the quality of their products so quickly and </i><br>
<i>&gt; competently.  In fact, I wish people were *greedier* and *more* selfish, in </i><br>
<i>&gt; general.  If they were, they wouldn't tolerate the government taking away over </i><br>
<i>&gt; half their income, we would all be making way more money, businesses wouldn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; have to pay so much in taxes and could afford to lower their prices </i><br>
<i>&gt; considerably (they would be driven to lower them, through competitive greed).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as greedy, selfish business people being the ones who will bring </i><br>
<i>&gt; prosperity to the poor of the world goes, remember that businesses always seek </i><br>
<i>&gt; to increase their number of customers.  When the market gets too difficult to </i><br>
<i>&gt; enter in rich countries, like the United States, then poorer countries will </i><br>
<i>&gt; look more appealing to the greedy business people.  At first, they will use </i><br>
<i>&gt; the poor people for cheap labor. And, at this point, the bleeding-hearts in </i><br>
<i>&gt; America start crying, "Exploitation!"  But we must remember that the poor </i><br>
<i>&gt; people wouldn't work for these businesses unless they were being paid more </i><br>
<i>&gt; than they were before.  They're still in a bad position, yes, but less so than </i><br>
<i>&gt; before, because they're making more money than before, and they're gaining </i><br>
<i>&gt; skills.  Then, other businesses will want to sell their products to these poor </i><br>
<i>&gt; people, who can now afford a little more, and now that they have more skills, </i><br>
<i>&gt; other greedy business people will want to come in and offer them jobs which </i><br>
<i>&gt; pay a little more than they are getting from their other jobs, so that they </i><br>
<i>&gt; can attract the best workers.  So, slowly, slowly, through the efforts of </i><br>
<i>&gt; greedy, selfish business people, the poor are raised from their poverty and </i><br>
<i>&gt; taught how to work and how to maintain a prosperous community.  Remember the </i><br>
<i>&gt; early days of the Industrial Revolution?  Remember all the poor people working </i><br>
<i>&gt; in the factories and all the cries of exploitation?  Well, look at the world </i><br>
<i>&gt; today.  We are much richer now than ever.  And it is because of all the </i><br>
<i>&gt; greedy, selfish people that exploit us whenever they can, as mush as they can. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But to exploit us, they must provide us with something we want, and then </i><br>
<i>&gt; their competitors will try to outdo them and offer us something even better, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and it goes back and forth and all around until eventually everyone is very </i><br>
<i>&gt; wealthy.  But we must give it time to run its course.  The poor won't become </i><br>
<i>&gt; wealthy overnight, but they are becoming wealthier than they ever were before. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  We are making progress, and most of our progress comes directly from the work </i><br>
<i>&gt; of greedy, selfish business people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
We are making progress, definitely, but HUMANITY is not making progress. <br>
Ethnic strife brought on by excruciating poverty and famine is ransacking <br>
much of the world. The western nations are a safe haven from the problems <br>
of the world. The biggest problem Canada has, according to the news, is <br>
constitutional matters. These seem to pale in comparison to the plight of <br>
people in Nigeria, where Shell is busy assisting in the extermination of <br>
an ecosystem and the suppression of human rights.<br>
<i>&gt; If the governments would just get out of the way and let the greedy, selfish </i><br>
<i>&gt; people do their good work, the prosperity would be spread around much faster.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Coercive, meddling governments are slowing down progress and the advancement </i><br>
<i>&gt; of prosperity considerably, and they are the biggest enemies of poor people </i><br>
<i>&gt; everywhere.</i><br>
Governments are villainous, I agree, but not as much as big business. Big <br>
business has government so firmly in it`s pocket it dictates when we have <br>
was. The gulf war was necessary to justify arms funding, which of course <br>
means more government subsidies. &gt; <br>
<i>&gt; A lot of the reason people are against greedy, selfish people is because they </i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine that there is only a limited amount of wealth to go around, so if the </i><br>
<i>&gt; greedy people take more, there is less left for everyone else.  Considering </i><br>
<i>&gt; that nearly all the wealth we enjoy now was not around a few million years </i><br>
<i>&gt; ago, or even a few hundered years ago, this view is patently absurd.  Wealth </i><br>
<i>&gt; is constantly being created, and most of it is being created by greedy, </i><br>
<i>&gt; selfish people, and that creation of wealth benefits us all.</i><br>
Depends on definition of wealth. In our still very industrial age, oil <br>
and other finite reserves imply wealth. Until we expand out into space <br>
and begin harvesting resources from there, we will have a limited amount <br>
of wealth. Especially now that we are so close to the brink.&gt; <br>
<i>&gt; Another point to make is that while greed and selfishness are extremely good </i><br>
<i>&gt; qualities for a business person to have, they are extremely dangerous </i><br>
<i>&gt; qualities for anyone involved in the government to have.  This is because </i><br>
<i>&gt; business people _make_ money through voluntary transaction (if they don't do </i><br>
<i>&gt; it voluntarily, I don't consider them business people, I consider them </i><br>
<i>&gt; thieves),</i><br>
Voluntary transaction being you can either work for the bare minimums <br>
and the possiblilty of death on the job or starve. Everybody has choices, <br>
just some people have choices which suck more.<br>
 while the government _gets_ its money by forcefully taking it from <br>
<i>&gt; people.  Thus, greedy politicians will cause even more money to be taken from </i><br>
<i>&gt; people and cause tyranny to grow while greedy business people will create more </i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth and cause prosperity and abundance to spread to everyone.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
MmMM, food for thought there. Government, in theory, is accountable to <br>
the people, corporations don`t even have the theory. If they can suppress <br>
a minority in order to gain the consumer support of a majority, they win. <br>
