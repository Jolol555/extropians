I just got a laptop and put my backlog of email in it.  Thought I could<br>
hang out in the cafe--or relax on the couch--and catch up on extropians.<br>
It is tougher than I thought.  I will try Eudora Pro 3.0 with its filters<br>
and its not-splitting-long-messages, before I give up altogether.<br>
<p>
Just want to say that I like short, sweet and thoughtful discussion of<br>
ideas, not long drawn out debates or discussions of plans for activism.<br>
Sometimes usenet groups split off separate -activism groups for that sort<br>
of stuff; if people are interested in that, maybe we can create an<br>
extropian-activism list?<br>
<p>
And btw, even comparing to other forms of activism, this all-out memetic<br>
warfare idea doesn't interest me.<br>
