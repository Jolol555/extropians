If this is genetic (as you imply), then we might find examining the way<br>
the genes control this behaviour useful. The most obvious mechanism is<br>
simply the pleasure factor -- sex is pleasurable by default for men, but<br>
not for women. If true, then women aren't refusing to have sex with random<br>
guys because they think it's in their genetic interest, but because it's<br>
just not likely to be much fun with someone who doesn't care much for<br>
them.<br>
<p>
Then there need be no physical (or even pyschological) brain differences,<br>
and if bodies were modified to make sex as safe and fun by default for<br>
women as it is for men, then there may well be no non-cultural sexual<br>
behaviour differences between the two genders at all. As someone has<br>
pointed out, the wide variation in behaviour around the planet tends to<br>
support this idea. <br>
<p>

<p>
I don't see how your statistics prove that -- they show that women are<br>
less likely to agree to have sex with a random guy than men with a random<br>
woman, but that's all. Why that is is another matter. <br>
