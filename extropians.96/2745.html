<p>
        I think a lot of communication stems from assumption.  Assumption is<br>
a primarily human trait that enables us to make a judgment without hearing a<br>
whole situation.  This realization was quite apparent for me yesterday after<br>
an unfortunate car accident on my behalf.  Anyhow, I believe that assumtion<br>
is one of the biggest flaws of human language.  Once someone makes an<br>
assumption, that assumption will eventually turn into what that person sees<br>
as true.  For example, a person passing by the scene of my accident might<br>
say "He must have been going too fast around that turn." when truly, that is<br>
not the case as all.  That person could go home and tell his\her family<br>
about how someone was "...going too fast down Nash Street".  That is not<br>
effective communication.<br>
<p>
        What *is* effective communication is fact-based discussion.  If the<br>
person [mentioned above] who saw my car after the crash was to find out<br>
*exactly* what happened, then he\she could effectively tell his\her<br>
family...or whoever truthfully.  However, if humans were to use fact-based<br>
discussion all the time, there would be a tremendous lack of creativity in<br>
the human race.  We're back where we started.  What exactly is the<br>
definition of 'effective communication'?  Sure, fact-based discussion is<br>
effective...but it gets very boring.  There has to be some sort of<br>
equilibrium between fact and filler.  There must be some way to say what we<br>
want to say while still keeping some sense of 'being human' within our<br>
words.  Any help or enlightenment as to *how* would be appreciated!  :~)<br>
