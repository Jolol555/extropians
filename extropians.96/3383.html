Michael Lorrey said in response to my criticism of his invention:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I was expecting this sort of response from many.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Eliezer Yudkowski replied: <br>
<i>&gt; Ah!  The persecution complex begins!  If you were expecting this, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; did you say anything before you had any experimental evidence?</i><br>
<p>
Indeed.  My "expected" response would have been entirely different <br>
had Mr. Lorrey not presented his idea such that it has all appearance <br>
of being just another variant of the Dean Drive, which has all the <br>
credibility of a perpetual motion machine.<br>
<p>
To Michael Lorrey:<br>
<p>
If you don't want to make yourself look like a crackpot, but are<br>
unwilling to reveal a critical detail without which your idea<br>
appears as pure quackery, then you should refain from revealing<br>
anything about it until you have the proper legal protection (i.e.<br>
patents) and are ready to disclose enough information to show how it <br>
might get around it's apparent fatal flaws.  I suggest that you read <br>
your own description of it while attempting to maintain the point of <br>
view of someone who does not know the critical secret ingredient.  <br>
Would you not find the concept highly suspicious from that <br>
perspective?<br>
