A generalization of the idea of a mantra <br>
<p>
A mantra is a sound that is repeated over and over, until it changes <br>
one's consciousness.  When I was a little boy, I discovered that if I said <br>
a word, any word, over and over, it would lose its meaning.  Try saying <br>
the word "tomorrow," for example.  After awhile it will become a <br>
resonant sound in your mind, and it will no longer be a just a token for <br>
the day after today.  Then when tomorrow comes, and you stop and <br>
remember this moment, and connect with it -- the result is not quite the <br>
same as deja vu, but similar.  (This was one of the first ways I found to <br>
get "stoned.")   <br>
<p>
Yogis have been experimenting with Sanskrit mantras for many <br>
centuries.   <br>
<p>
In the West, we have traditionally changed our consciousness with more <br>
complex patterns of thought.  In the renaissance, for example, there was <br>
an elaborate art of memory, in which the student would imagine a <br>
cathedral in great detail, and associate an idea with each point of the <br>
space in the cathedral.  He would imagine starting at a certain point, and <br>
going from there to the next point, and so on through an elaborate train <br>
of thought.  This is where the expression "in the first place" comes <br>
from.  When explaining something, a professor would start at the first <br>
place, then go on to the second place -- almost literally.  The students <br>
were expected to "follow," in the same almost-literal sense, as the <br>
professor led them from point to point in the cathedral.  <br>
<p>
Today, we have lost the rich metaphor of the building.  But we still try <br>
to guide ourselves though a train of thought -- that's what a university <br>
curriculum is for.  To get a degree in medicine, you go to a series of <br>
lectures and lab meetings where your attention is directed toward <br>
certain topics in a certain order, and you emerge with a mind that thinks <br>
like a doctor's mind.  Each profession has its own vocabulary and its <br>
own habits of thought, and each professional person goes through a <br>
long training program to learn those habits of thought.  <br>
<p>
Everybody, professional or not, learns certain habitual thought patterns. <br>
The idea of a mantra can be generalized to include all habits of thought <br>
that are repeated for a long time and result in a certain form of <br>
consciousness.  <br>
<p>
Some people don't just do this in their professional training.  They try <br>
to guide themselves through a train of thought designed to change their <br>
consciousness, not just when performing practical tasks, but also when <br>
contemplating the universe.  When thinking about physics, for example, <br>
such a person -- who, we are assuming, is not a professional physicist -- <br>
would study the argument in a certain chapter of a certain book, and go <br>
over it in his mind, over and over, connecting words to images, putting <br>
the images together into a whole, until he "saw" the principle of <br>
relativity, i.e. he saw, as an immediate gestalt, how the constancy of the <br>
speed of light is the central axiom which makes the rest of <br>
electromagnetism coherent.  He would see this vision as clearly as the <br>
renaissance student saw his cathedral.  <br>
<p>
This results in a change of consciousness every bit as intense as LSD, <br>
and much more productive.  <br>
<p>
The same phenomenon occurs in other areas besides science.  Jimmie <br>
Connors repeated the tennis mantra with such force that he could see, as <br>
the ball left his opponent's racquet, which way it was spinning.  To him, <br>
when he was at his peak of concentration, a tennis ball looked as big as <br>
a basketball, and seemed to be moving in slow motion.  <br>
<p>
Video games can also be effective mantras, especially the ones which <br>
take you through a series of screens, each one similar to the earlier ones, <br>
but faster and more difficult.  If you play one of these games hundreds <br>
of times, until you can routinely reach the 15th screen, you find yourself <br>
in a new state of consciousness, in which a lot of things seem to move <br>
in slow motion.  <br>
<p>
Most people don't make this effort.  They let their environment guide <br>
their thoughts.  Most people go through a daily mantra of muzak and tv, <br>
created for them by the entertainment industry, which is more than <br>
happy to perform this service.  <br>
<p>
So, there are conscious mantras, patterns of thought chosen by us, <br>
and default mantras, given to us -- sometimes forced on us, to some <br>
extent -- by society.  We always have a choice, either to create <br>
a mantra for ourselves, or to drift along on one of the many mantras  <br>
that are provided for us.  <br>
<p>
Now, suppose someone decides to take control of his own mind, and <br>
choose his own mantra, day by day.  He is going to let his thoughts be <br>
guided, not by his environment, but by his quest to see the origins of <br>
things.  Suppose he studies causality in many contexts:  he reads <br>
Cairns-Smith and Kauffman on the origin of life, Rene Thom on <br>
embryology and morphogenetic forms, Ophiel on creative visualization, <br>
Aristotle on the four kinds of causality, Leibniz and Heidegger on the <br>
Principle of Sufficient Reason, and so forth.  Suppose he forms the <br>
habit of seeing things not as they present themselves, but as part of a <br>
causal chain.  For example, a towel came from a store, before that from <br>
a factory, before that from a cotton mill, before that from a farm;  and <br>
meanwhile, on another causal track, it began as an idea in somebody's <br>
mind.  The student who follows this mantra for years, until it becomes <br>
part of the fabric of his thoughts, will, at unpredictable times, fall into a <br>
state of reverie, perhaps artificially induced, perhaps not, in which the <br>
vision I mentioned earlier will appear.  <br>
