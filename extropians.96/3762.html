                <br>
<p>
That's not very reassuring, you're saying the universe exists for the same  <br>
reason that Santa Claus exists. Your sentence can't examine itself unless  it <br>
already has the laws of logic at its disposal, and the laws of logic are <br>
something. Far from justifying itself all you have shown is that the logical  <br>
system you're using is inconsistent, as you can use it just as easily to  <br>
prove that Santa Claus does not exist with it.<br>
<p>
Not that there is anything particularly bad with the system you used, all of <br>
them have flaws. Godel proved that any logical system is either incomplete or  <br>
inconsistent or both. For example, I could use Russell's Theory of Types to  <br>
brand such self referential sentences as meaningless, but unfortunately I  <br>
would be forced to condemn many other innocent sentences as meaningless too <br>
even though their only crime is to use the word "me" or "I", even a sentence  <br>
as splendid as this one would be called meaningless, obviously such an <br>
outrage  can not be tolerated. <br>
                        <br>

<i>                        &gt;&gt;By far the deepest problem in Philosophy, why is                       </i><br>
<i>                        &gt;&gt;there something rather than  nothing?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I don't know.                                  </i><br>
                <br>
Me neither.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;That there is in point of fact something illustrates that                                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;there are  self-justifying causes.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All you're saying is "The reason the universe exists is the reason the <br>
universe exists". Perhaps, but that's less that helpful and it doesn't  <br>
explain what's wrong with the idea "The reason the universe does NOT  exist <br>
is the reason the universe does not exist". Anyway, there may not be a  <br>
reason at all, lots of things have no cause.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;And, the problem is neither deepest - nor the most                                 &gt;complicated.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
"Absolutely Nothing" seem like an elegant solution to me, I can find nothing  <br>
self contradictory in "Absolutely Nothing", after all, there are no rules of  <br>
logic to contradict, it's the ultimate in elegant simplicity. "Absolutely  <br>
Nothing" even obeys Occam's Razor, not that it needs to, the Razor is  <br>
something, so it wouldn't exist either. <br>
<p>
Yet there is something. Why? It's even more puzzling than trying to figure   <br>
out why induction works.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;A surplus of mental energy and self-esteem is NOT an                                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;evolutionary advantage   </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
I don't think that's true, but even if it were, why should that concern me? <br>
Immortality would not be an evolutionary advantage, but it would certainly be <br>
an advantage to me, if evolution determines that it will slow down the  <br>
duplication of my genes in the population I don't care. If evolution doesn't  <br>
like it evolution can lump it.<br>

<i>                &gt;Computational causality is what makes a Turing machine move                                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;forwards in time. Cognitive causality is what makes a person                      </i><br>
<i>                &gt;say: "A causes B" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A person is a Turing Machine (with a finite tape). In this particular case  <br>
the output computed by the Turing Machine is "A causes B".<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Cognitive causality is a set of algorithms.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly. To repeat, what's the difference between cognitive and computational <br>
causality?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Thermodynamic causality is a statistical application of                                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Occam's Razor.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, Thermodynamics makes use of probability and statistics, but there are  <br>
only 2 reasons we resort to this approximation: <br>
1) Lack of information about initial conditions. <br>
2) Lack of sufficient computational resources. <br>
I think you'd do better to talk about Quantum  Mechanical causality, or  <br>
rather, non causality.<br>
                  <br>

<i>                &gt;Platonic is the reason why 2 + 2 = 4; it is a form of                                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;causality which does not involve time.                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I would think that causality would need to "cause" something to happen, <br>
but  in your example nothing is happening. Like all true  equations it's a  <br>
tautology.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Would you agree to the statement:  "All computations are                                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;equally existent regardless of  any physical implementation?" </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
No, I would not agree. Even though almost all Real numbers are random, a <br>
computation that produces such a random number does not exist. A computation  <br>
that produces the largest prime number does not exist. If Tipler is wrong and  <br>
the universe is not capable of making an infinite number of calculations <br>
between now and The Big Crunch then there is an entire class of computations <br>
that do not exist, at least if the word "exist" is to have a useful meaning.<br>
