<i>&gt;&gt; From: David Musick </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A techno-elite will arise in *any* scenario.  And I, for one, don't see </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; anything wrong with that</i><br>
<p>
Max M:<br>
<i>&gt;I think that's either a defeatist, fatalistic or impassionate attitude to</i><br>
<i>&gt;hold. And apart from that we have to make shure that there will not be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;too small elite as it will stop the exponential growth.</i><br>
<p>
Over the past year, I have read many books on the progress of <br>
technology and its historical impact on society.  Aside from the <br>
inevitable growing pains and periods of socio-economic instability, <br>
there seems to be a repeating pattern of the "new" technologies <br>
becoming more accessible, easier to use, less expensive, more available <br>
to people with lower levels of training.  The "elites" move on to newer <br>
applications or the invention of newer technologies, and everyone <br>
else gets a crack at the goodies that were previously unavailable.  <br>
<p>
Let's use the Internet as an example.  It used to be the province of <br>
highly-trained technologists of various fields, and us non-technical <br>
dweebs only got into it through the efforts of our (very patient) friends<br>
to train us.  And we discovered our own instinctual abilities to <br>
navigate the abstractions of cyberspace, thereby adding to the pool <br>
of human evolution.  Over the past twenty years, through economic and <br>
career incentives, millions of public portals have been added, <br>
guidebooks published, training classes established.  An entire <br>
movement has arisen based on a commitment to retaining free access <br>
("freenets").   The "elites" that gripe about the newbies found that <br>
they could simply move to more private forums--plenty of bandwidth for <br>
all.<br>
<p>
I could see where this separation between the technological vanguard <br>
and everyone else could become deadly significant--the point at which <br>
someone invents a transformational technology that renders the users <br>
nonhuman.  That might rupture the process of information dissemination <br>
and leave a lot of people behind, unless this was taken into account <br>
during the development of the technology.<br>
<p>
