Banjo said:<br>
I'm reminded of the Japanese <br>
saying "when all you have is a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail".<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
With respect, the farthest back I can trace this is to Abraham <br>
Maslow. I'd love to get a source for its being Japanese. Do you have <br>
one?<br>

Banjo said:<br>
i'm not denying that "commerce is natural", i'm only denying that<br>
"commerce is all"<br>
<p>
Me:<br>
I'd say that "commerce is the minimum level of civility with which <br>
we can, or ought hope to, hold as a standard for dealing with strangers".  <br>
Courteous commerce, not commerce shoved down anyone's throat. <br>
And that's sometimes a blurry thing, unfortunately (see below).<br>
<p>
But we're told the Phoenicians managed it, without even knowing the <br>
languages of the people they traded with (in some cases, at least).<br>
<p>
The source of that civility may be anything, including especially <br>
compassion. For example, the Rotarians, corny as they may seem.<br>
<p>
What an utter stranger needs to know most, however, is not <br>
"does this unknown person want me to have a wonderful life?" but rather <br>
"will this person rip me off, or kill me, or enslave me?" <br>
<p>
Or to quote Einstein (possibly apocryphally), "The most important <br>
question a person can ask is: 'Is the universe a friendly place?'". <br>
<p>
There's friendly-like-Mom-&amp;-Dad, and there's friendly-like-the-nice-<br>
man-behind-the-candy-counter, and there's friendly-like-the-crack-<br>
dealer-down-the-block. Are they interchangeable? Not really. (1) may <br>
be better than (2), but (2) is better than (3). I think. And these <br>
are all generalizations, anyway.<br>
<p>
Ob Extropian comment, re: "what is enlightenment":<br>
I see the H. accelerans speed-mismatch issue as being one that <br>
could result in considerable trouble and potential mistrust. <br>
<p>
Consider how irritated some people get when they're stuck in <br>
traffic after just a couple coffees. Now scale that by two orders <br>
of magnitude. How pissed-off can someone get in a subjective <br>
half-hour, waiting for the non-accelerated human in front to <br>
notice the light has been green for 18 whole objective seconds?<br>
<p>
And how tempted to do something impolite and self-serving?<br>
<p>
Perhaps enlightenment is that set of qualities that will keep <br>
accelerated humans from doing such, even when sorely tempted...?<br>
