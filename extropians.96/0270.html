It's difficult to understand what the goals of transhumans (used in the<br>
sense of "transcended humans") might be. As you say, the paths may not<br>
be mutually exclusive, however, it seems to me that economics dictate <br>
the inward path. For example, you launch a manned exploration/colonization<br>
mission to Mars, I send trillions of nanoprobes to cover the planet and<br>
recreate all of Mars inside a VR. The material mass of my effort may be<br>
only a few grams, miniscule compared to your mission. I'm not sure that<br>
any additional benefit you get with the larger mission (mostly, it would<br>
seem to consist only of additional matter to process) would justify<br>
the extravagent cost. So I don't think it's just the difference between<br>
couch potatoes and explorers; one could explore my VR Mars virtually<br>
forever.<br>
<p>
Not to get mystical here, but, to me, the entire "external" universe<br>
exists inside my head. Perhaps there's an "end to science", where increased<br>
knowledge only improves our comprehension of the universe by a few<br>
decimal places. In such a case being able to construct a clockwork<br>
universe inside VR at least means we'll be able to understand the totality<br>
of it eventually. We just print out the source code.<br>
<p>
The original Great Filter post wondered why we didn't see evidence of<br>
intelligent reengineering of the universe. It might seem a shame to us<br>
to consider that advanced civilizations always take the inward path,<br>
but it seems possible that the rewards therein may be as great, or<br>
even greater than, those obtained by outward exploration. Perhaps they<br>
discover that the whole universe is a computer program, and escaping it<br>
(or teleporting anywhere within it) is just a matter of reconfiguring the<br>
kernal.<br>
