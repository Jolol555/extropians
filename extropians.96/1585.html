<i>&gt; The whole issue is about the rates of change.  You have been claiming</i><br>

<p>
1) Assumption: the compuer component contributes non-trivially to the<br>
   intelligence of the entity, once the entity comes into existance<br>
2) Observation: computer hardware and software technology are advancing<br>
   at an empirically-observed exponential rate known as "Moore's Law",<br>
   which we both agreed is unlikely to change in the near future. This<br>
   rate is dramatically faster than the 30-year sustained rates of<br>
increase<br>
   of the other technologies you mention.<br>
3) Assumption: a more-intelligent entity can develop<br>
intelligence-augmentation<br>
   faster than a less-intelligent entity.<br>
4) Conclusion: This is a fast-feedback loop.<br>
<p>
Best I can do concisely, Robin.<br>
