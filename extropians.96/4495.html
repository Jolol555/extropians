<i>&gt;The challenge I see here is that there might have to be a 'speciation' </i><br>

<i>&gt;assuming that the wave-front probes could only have 'one' goal if they </i><br>
<i>&gt;were to be able to expand at ~lightspeed: grab resources, replicate </i><br>
<i>&gt;(if necessary) while *always* on the move. That is, they would not </i><br>
<i>&gt;have time to stop and 'smell the flowers', analyze the environment, or </i><br>
<i>&gt;design anything new.  They would have to leave behind non-probe </i><br>
<i>&gt;'seeds' that would grow to fullfill these more leisurely functions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;These lingering colonists would be the ones that would have time to </i><br>
<i>&gt;actually interact with their environment, create art and design new </i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies.  Maybe the difference between the two groups would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;more like sexual genders than different species?</i><br>
<p>
If the probes don't stop, you are placing the task of reproduction of those<br>
probes in the hands of whatever 'seeds' they leave behind, therefore the<br>
individual 'seeds' would not have much time either, to 'smell the flowers'.<br>
The only goal of such a culture would be Expansion, unless you come up with<br>
a 3 gender structure, viewing both the probe and the replicators as 'units'<br>
whose sole purpose is to spread the human/transhuman/posthuman or whatever<br>
life form... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would there be any possibility for the always-moving-on probes to ever </i><br>
<i>&gt;learn from the environment (other than reflex reactions, such as </i><br>
<i>&gt;avoiding clouds of antimatter or blasts of lethal radiation)? Would </i><br>
<i>&gt;there be any way (or even need) for the probes and colonists to </i><br>
<i>&gt;communicate and adapt based on each other's knowledge?</i><br>
<p>
They could 'drop off' their gathered knowlegde like their 'seeds' at every<br>
new 'colony' they create, the knowledge could then be brought back at lower<br>
speeds by a fourth type of unit, that gathers information and spreads it<br>
between the colonies, not just between colonies that were created by the<br>
same probe, but far more efficiently by passing at least one colony of each<br>
probe, on its way back to earth. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps there are ways around my assumption that the expanding </i><br>
<i>&gt;wave-front would not have time to adapt and learn new things?  I </i><br>
<i>&gt;assume that, even at lightspeed, the probes would still be subject to </i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary pressures and would be 'blindly' selected/adapted in that </i><br>
<i>&gt;way. Still, I can't see any way for the probes to learn anything from </i><br>
<i>&gt;those they left behind. Maybe they wouldn't need to as long as they </i><br>
<i>&gt;continued to carry on the seeds necessary to create more colonists?</i><br>
<p>
If the probe 'drops' it's latest knowledge at it's last colony, they can<br>
make new probes that include technology based on that new knowlegde.<br>
Ofcourse there would be a loss of time. In case of a time sensitive<br>
disaster, we would have to do with the probes we've got. <br>
