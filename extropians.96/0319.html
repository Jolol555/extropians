	There's a lot of very obvious things that could be programmed into a parallel <br>
computer quite easily.  Most serial programs existing contain routines which <br>
are pretty much independent of each other and could be done simultaneously.  <br>
And then there's all the stuff that's programmed to appear that  things are <br>
running simultaneously, such as the multi-tasking environments, like Windows.  <br>
Why don't people build machines that are capable of true multi-tasking?  <br>
Current programming techniques would only have to be modified slightly to take <br>
advantage of the parallel processors.  Parallel programming really isn't that <br>
hard... unless you're an idiot.  Every time I write I a program, I think, "My <br>
God! this would be so much easier if I had a parallel processor!"  It's not <br>
really that hard for humans to think about the fact that many things should be <br>
happening at the same time to solve a problem efficiently.<br>
	One good use for parallel processors is Virtual Reality.  If there was a <br>
small processor for each pixel or small group of pixels, calculating the <br>
scene, we could have high quality, real-time ray-tracing.  Each pixel is <br>
independent of all the others, so all the pixels can be calculated <br>
simultaneously.  One could even build a parallel processor and put it on a <br>
card that could be added on to current PC's as a device.  There's probably a <br>
market for a good rendering chip.<br>
	I'm thinking people should build computers that are parallel, down to very <br>
small components.  Each component has connections to a few of it's neighboring <br>
components and can be programmed to respond to input in various ways and give <br>
output to their various neighbors, depending on how they transform their <br>
input.  Machine level programming would basically be about specifying how each <br>
component responds to input, and arranging the patterns of response into <br>
systems which accomplish a particular goal.  These systems can be used as <br>
components within larger systems of interaction and so forth.  Anything that <br>
can be done on modern serial computers could be done one these massively <br>
parallel computers; one could even simulate a serial computer on it, but it <br>
can also be used for very fast parallel computations.<br>
	Parallel computers just make so much more sense than serial computers, so I <br>
think it's only a matter of time until they're commonplace.  Programmers who <br>
are too lazy or stupid to write parallel programs could still write serial <br>
programs on a parallel computer; they wouldn't be taking full advantage of the <br>
machine's capabilities, but they would have nothing to complain about since <br>
they could still do whatever they did before. <br>
