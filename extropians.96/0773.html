Lots and lots of problems are solved if everyone approximates a plant.<br>
By which I mean having within one's sphere of influence enough wealth to<br>
survive.  Actually, if you count human labor (all spheres) most of us<br>
already have that.  The problem of course is that generally the welath<br>
needs help to be converted into usable form, the way desert farmers need<br>
to trade for water.  Which means everyone must trade to survive, which<br>
means that the first libertarian liberty of being able not to interact<br>
is meaningless, which is why I'm suddenly taking issues of economic<br>
coercion much more seriously.  Having one's own self-sufficient wealth<br>
would solve that problem; I think it would also help solve the<br>
reproduction problem.  A rational being (and most people can be locally<br>
rational) wouldn't have more children than their sphere could support.<br>

If there wasn't a frontier (uh oh, extropians like frontiers) and<br>
children didn't have a high probability of dying and it was clear how<br>
many people at what level your domain could support, people should breed<br>
less.  If they didn't, people otherwise inclined to feel guilty could<br>
point to the time when everything was set up right and say to the excess<br>
children "We're sorry, but this is clearly your parents' fault, and we<br>
clearly can't help you without becoming equally poor ourselves.  Go<br>
away."<br>
<p>
} Problem: how do we get there?<br>
<p>
Er.  Massive one-time redistribution?  But there might not _be_ enough<br>
easily usable wealth to go around.  <br>

} reproductive capacity (can you hear all the libertarians screaming <br>

Libertarianism is ill-defined regarding reproduction, IMO.<br>

I'll dance upon your grave a twelvemonth and a day<br>
I'll do as much for you, as any maiden may.<br>
I'll make you rue the very day you were born<br>
