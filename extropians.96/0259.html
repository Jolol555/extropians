<i>&gt; If you haven't read Linda Nagata's "The Bohr Maker" (Bantam Spectra, Apr'95, </i><br>

<i>&gt; little time for fiction. Her story (with well-developed characters &amp; drama </i><br>
<i>&gt; for a first-time novel) involves a near-future solar system based on </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology, 'attrium' implants for full immersion into VR and the </i><br>
<i>&gt; transmission of mind copies between distributed attriums.</i><br>
<p>
I also recommend the book, I have no doubt many extropians will enjoy it. <br>
By the way, it is "atrium", not "attrium" (probably from the open room at <br>
the center of roman villas where visitors were received). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Plus, there's a </i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian struggle against a 'Gaian' World government that exists for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; primary purpose of avoiding a 'gray-goo booboo' AND proscribing transhuman </i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies.</i><br>
<p>
It is a bit more subtle than that. I think the Commonwealth represents<br>
just the kind of state (or in this case, international organization) that<br>
extropians fear and want to fight again (guess why the book is so fun<br>
reading then). But it isn't naive - there is a real fear, and a real<br>
danger, so public opinion generally supports it (_Tech heaven_ give some<br>
hints of its beginnings). All transhuman technologies are not proscribed, <br>
just the too drastic (independent AI, uncontrolled assemblers, multiple <br>
physical copies of the same person). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While it may be feasible that such a device itself could eventually be built </i><br>
<i>&gt; and implanted, a few practical interim questions are (a) how would an </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'attrium' interact with the organic human brain and nervous system;</i><br>
<p>
As I see it, Nagata's idea is that the atrium itself is a nanocomputer <br>
network that send out interface threads to neurons in the owner's brain. <br>
For example, it might be located above the cortical surface, sending down <br>
bundles of nanofibres into the sensory and motoric pathways so that it <br>
can override/augment the outside signal (this could be done by inhibiting <br>
the primary sensory imput and sending in new input; a quite fun <br>
neuroelectronic problem). With nanotechnology this is probably quite <br>
simple, the hard part is making sense of the signals (in the I/O parts of <br>
the brain there is probably less variation than the cognitive systems). <br>
<p>
Creating ghosts seem to imply that the nanofibers can read *all* of the <br>
brain, and transmit the uploaded pattern. This is much harder and less <br>
likely.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; how could the necessary wide-bandwidth and far-ranging communications be </i><br>
<i>&gt; implemented, especially given the current worries about the effects on </i><br>
<i>&gt; organic functions of ELF and more high-powered electromagnetic energies? </i><br>
<i>&gt; (When even cellular phones are suspected of having some impact on brain </i><br>
<i>&gt; tumors in certain genetically susceptible individuals, it seems unlikely </i><br>
<i>&gt; that a radio transponder could be implanted in human brains without serious </i><br>
<i>&gt; biological side effects.)</i><br>
<p>
What about a body area network a la those under development at MIT? <br>
Signals could also be sent to a transponder (or several) outside the head <br>
area, and medical nanites could keep the surrounding tissues healthy. <br>
Although I would probably opt for a infrared system, which interacted <br>
with the surrounding local networks (but in _The Bohr Maker_ the system <br>
seems to be able to function by radio).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a communication alternative, there is some speculation in the quantum </i><br>
<i>&gt; physics community over the potential for non-local communication, i.e., once </i><br>
<i>&gt; they have interacted, two quantum particles remain immediately correlated </i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of their distance from each other. Some progress in quantum </i><br>
<i>&gt; computing based on these principles has been made.</i><br>
<p>
Quantum entanglement isn't useful as an information carrier (I think this<br>
has been proven quite rigorously), but it is useful in cryptography and<br>
quantum computation. If I have one of a pair of correlated particles and<br>
you the other, any change I do to the particle will destroy the<br>
correlation and does not cause any detectable change to your particle (it<br>
is the initial states that are correlated). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it is for these reasons that Linda Nagata envisioned fully-immersive </i><br>
<i>&gt; communication between attriums taking place only via the downloading of </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'ghosts', extracts of a person's sensibilities, memories &amp; mind, able to </i><br>
<i>&gt; transmit to another's attrium, reside there 'off line' from the originator's </i><br>
<i>&gt; mind, and able to return the experiences to the originator only by </i><br>
<i>&gt; disengaging and uploading back to the 'home address'.</i><br>
<p>
This seems to be reasonable over interplanetary distances too (even on <br>
the same planet; the delays become comparable to neural delays on a scale <br>
of just thousands of kilometers). <br>
<p>
Interesting idea: "squatter ghosts" and other infomorphs that move <br>
between the atria of people, using the empty buffer space used to <br>
receiving ghosts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 07/20/96. ATTRIUM DESIGN LEVELS. While Nagata doesn't go into any of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; following, I think there would likely be several stages in the development </i><br>
<i>&gt; of such attriums:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A level 1 Attrium would basically be a thought &amp; experience recorder: able </i><br>
<i>&gt; to replay sensations and subvocalized thoughts; which also implies a </i><br>
<i>&gt; capability to generate something like a 'hypnotic state' for controlled </i><br>
<i>&gt; overriding of sensations from ones' immediate physical environment during </i><br>
<i>&gt; playback.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds almost like an enchanced reality version of the current prototype <br>
wearable computers, with an useful user interface. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Key areas to be explored would include </i><br>
<i>&gt; agents that could simultaneously monitor 'mood' from within the </i><br>
<i>&gt; hormone-filled ventricles of the brain</i><br>
<p>
Just a small correction: the hormones in the ventricles are rather bad<br>
predictors of mood (especially since most hormones are released into the<br>
blood) - I suggest that you look at the activity in the limbic system<br>
instead. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A practical goal would be a system for handicapped people </i><br>
<i>&gt; that provides a simulated keyboard in their minds that could be used to </i><br>
<i>&gt; capture mentally spelled-out sentences.</i><br>
<p>
There have been some success in interpreting arm movements in monkeys due <br>
to cortical activity patterns (Schwartz et al, see SciAm a few months <br>
back), so this may be feasible. <br>
