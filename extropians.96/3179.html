The Power of Symbiosis<br>
<p>
I've been contemplating the possibility that highly advanced beings will <br>
eventually regard humans as useless and entropic and destroy the humans.  Eric <br>
Watt Forste has suggested that I consider the idea that advanced beings may <br>
use humans as processors of certain types of information, sort of like we use <br>
calculators now.  <br>
<p>
This idea would be much more likely to happen if the humans were equipped with <br>
more powerful interfaces, such as virtual reality suits or computers linked <br>
directly to their brains, which allowed them to quickly and accurately express <br>
their ideas by creating images and other data structures which they could then <br>
send to other computers, which could pass the ideas on to other humans or to <br>
the advanced beings.  The humans could also receive complex data structures <br>
through their computer interface.  It may appear to them as images and three <br>
dimensional environments, and they will manipulate the data that they are <br>
given and pass it on.<br>
<p>
I can imagine engineers taking on projects to design objects and systems with <br>
various properties, visualizing all their work by using the computer in their <br>
head, using that computer to communicate with other computers to retrieve <br>
needed information (such as various precise properties of different <br>
substances).  When they were done with their work, they would send it off to <br>
the entity requesting it, and they would receive the agreed benefits from <br>
doing that work.  An advanced being who is wanting to design a very complex <br>
system may subdivide the task into many parts and use human engineers to <br>
complete various tasks, much as we often use a calculator to perform <br>
arithmetic tasks for us; it's often more efficient to buy, maintain and use <br>
the calculator than to do all the arithmetic ourselves.  There are many tasks <br>
which humans are good at, and I can imagine very powerful entities hiring <br>
humans to complete various tasks as long as there wasn't a more efficient <br>
device to carry out the task.<br>
<p>
When humans are all wired to computers, with virtual reality suits or brain <br>
implants, one could think of the whole world of humans and computers as a <br>
large and highly complex computer system, with human minds acting as one type <br>
of processor in that system.  Information that is best processed by humans <br>
will be directed to humans to work on, and they will send their results to the <br>
appropriate places to be processed further. <br>
<p>
Actually, I already view the world that way.  We are not all wired to <br>
computers yet, but we all interact with each other or with systems that <br>
interact with others.  We all take in information from the world and make <br>
changes to the world which others take in as information to process.  We are <br>
all processing information and communicating it to each other, by our actions, <br>
by the changes we make in the world.  We cause air to vibrate as sound; we <br>
create objects and visual images; we create machines; we make many changes in <br>
the world, and all our changes are forms of communication with other people <br>
and whatever other systems are influenced by the changes we make.  Our <br>
cultures and societies are huge organic and psychological machines, evolving <br>
and mutating.  We are components of these organic machines, and we each have <br>
varying degrees of influence over the behavior of the machine and other <br>
components of the machine.  <br>
<p>
My goals include developing a deep understanding of the nature of the organic <br>
and psychological machine that I find myself to be a component of; to learn <br>
how to manipulate the behavior of this machine so that it works to achieve my <br>
goals.  The machine of Humanity is tremendously large and complex.  It is <br>
composed of the minds of individual humans, linked together through social <br>
systems, such as language, religion, government, science, technology, art and <br>
so forth (all are forms of language, actually).  Through these social systems, <br>
human minds interact with each other.  We manipulate each other's sensory <br>
environments by causing changes in the world which others observe and respond <br>
to.<br>
I am working to become adept at using all these forms of communication to <br>
influence the thinking of Humanity.  I wish to alter the behavior of human <br>
minds and the systems they create, in such a way that my goals are <br>
accomplished.  To some extent, we all are doing this; we all have found ways <br>
to get what we want from the world, to some degree.  By behaving in certain <br>
ways, we have learned to influence others to provide us with money and other <br>
experiences we seek.  We all have learned to manipulate the system to some <br>
extent.  I, however, am working on doing this to a much greater extent than <br>
most do.  I am working to understand how to tweak the system of Humanity in <br>
the right ways to have my goals be accomplished by the system.<br>
<p>
As an Extropian, my goals include improving the system of Humanity, finding <br>
ways to make it more intelligent and creative.  As a component of that system, <br>
I will benefit from helping other components to be more intelligent and <br>
competent at accomplishing their goals, since many of our goals are very <br>
similar.  I am working first on training my own mind and increasing my own <br>
intelligence and creativity.  Then, I wish to use my advanced intelligence and <br>
creativity to become highly competent in the many fields of human endeavor <br>
which interest me.  I wish to make significant improvements in every field I <br>
enter and to assist others in training their minds to do the same in their <br>
chosen fields of interest.<br>
<p>
It is my understanding that to influence others to assist me with my goals, I <br>
must provide them something of value; I must assist them in accomplishing <br>
their goals as well.  What value can I provide others so they will help me <br>
accomplish my goals?  How do I acquire this value, this ability to influence <br>
others?  My understanding is that I must create it within myself first.  I <br>
must become more intelligent and creative and more expert in working with <br>
others, to help them achieve their goals effectively.  If I help them to <br>
increase their intelligence and creativity, they will also be more competent <br>
in accomplishing their goals and in helping me accomplish my goals.<br>
<p>
To accomplish my goals effectively, I am realizing that I must work closely <br>
with many other people.  It is strongly in my interest to help increase the <br>
intelligence and creativity of those I work with so that we are more able to <br>
effectively and efficiently achieve our common goals.<br>
<p>
As I advance myself, it is in my interest to help others advance as well, so <br>
that we may be strong partners and be more effective working together than any <br>
of us would be working alone.  It is also in my interest to not create <br>
enemies, any system which would impede my goals.  As far as I understand, the <br>
best way to avoid creating enemies is to make oneself of great value to as <br>
many other systems as possible.  This way, it is in very few systems' interest <br>
to interfere with one's goals.  I must be very careful to not appear as a <br>
threat to other's goals so they do not make themselves a threat to mine.  This <br>
is the wisdom of "loving one's enemies", turning them into friends and the <br>
wisdom of developing deep, loving emotional bonds with as many others as <br>
possible.  It is an excellent strategy for accomplishing one's goals, <br>
encouraging others to work cooperatively with each other and oneself to <br>
achieve common goals.<br>
<p>
So, is an advanced and extremely powerful entity likely to destroy humans?  It <br>
seems to me that the most advanced and powerful entities will be those who are <br>
extremely adept at cooperating with as many others as possible and assisting <br>
as many others as possible to advance themselves as well so they are able to <br>
assist each other more effectively and intelligently.  It seems to me that the <br>
most advanced and powerful beings will not be those who dominate and control <br>
others, but those who are able to develop strong, mutually beneficial <br>
relationships with as many others as possible.  I believe that the most <br>
powerful and advanced beings will be constantly searching for ways to develop <br>
symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationships with as many other systems as <br>
possible.  I believe that the most powerful beings will eventually be those <br>
who are of the greatest value to the largest number of systems.  Because they <br>
will be of value to the most systems, they will have the greatest number of <br>
systems working to help them accomplish their goals, and because the ability <br>
to effectively achieve one's goals is what power truly is, these beings will <br>
be the most powerful beings.<br>
<p>
Considering this, it seems unlikely that extremely powerful beings will be a <br>
threat to humans, since they will be most powerful by developing ways to <br>
cooperate effectively with as many humans as possible.  I also believe they <br>
would have a great interest in assisting humans in becoming more intelligent <br>
and creative since this would enable the humans to more effectively assist the <br>
powerful beings.  The most powerful beings on this planet have always had <br>
deeply symbiotic relationships with other beings.  Humans are some of the <br>
results of profoundly symbiotic relationships among all their cells and among <br>
the other bacteria which live in their bodies and among the other living <br>
organisms on the earth which produce food for humans and maintain a suitable <br>
living environment for humans.  I expect that truly advanced beings will <br>
continue to follow this successful strategy of developing profoundly symbiotic <br>
relationships with many, many other systems.<br>
