<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Thisis understood. Where I am coming from is that everthing humans do is<br>
done with the best of intentions (possibly excepting an extremely small<br>
fraction that know that they are doing evil and willfully continue), and<br>
that, as it is said, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<br>
<p>
Successful memes are so because they are seen by a large enough<br>
percentage as beneficial and for the good of all. A meme that is<br>
recognized by at least a majority to be wholly evil will never be<br>
successful. While one may counter that communism is such an example of a<br>
successful evil meme that was opposed by a large percentage, this is<br>
not  the case. For starters, communism has enjoyed nowhere near the<br>
success as a meme as say, Christianity has (less than 5% proportionate<br>
life), nor has penetrated as deeply into as many societies for as long<br>
as Christianity.<br>
<p>
A more comparative meme is capitalism. It has been a successful meme<br>
even longer than christianity, beacuse it also works inconcert with<br>
humanity's basic instinctual and other prior memscapes to a far greater<br>
extent. Communism sought to reverse human behavior, and died as a<br>
result.<br>
<p>
To relate this to extropy, we can take two roads:<br>
<p>
1) if we assume that human history only has a few hundred years at most,<br>
if not less than a century of life left to it, we can take the low less<br>
principled road, and adapt the practical aspects of extropy to<br>
interweave with the existing memescape, to take on and mold our<br>
civilization by storm, which is essentially what it will take (it took<br>
communism 50-70 years to take over half the world, using any means that<br>
achieved the goals).<br>
<p>
2) if we assume that the principle of transhuman singularities are only<br>
relative to the past, and we will still be subjectively "human" (while<br>
our prior selves will look like barbarians, or infants) then we can take<br>
a more principled approach, with a long view of taking centuries to<br>
reach a level of saturation to become the dominant memplex in the<br>
memeography.<br>
