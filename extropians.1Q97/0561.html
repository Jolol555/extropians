No insult taken, I just think you're wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) the colony would all be in one tight little place</i><br>
<p>
Well, you'll be adding a lot of expense and complexity if you try to<br>
spread your colony out too much. Anyway, a 10MT warhead will destroy any<br>
habitation at a depth of six feet over an area of more than a square km. <br>
The same could be achieved with a larger number of much smaller warheads. <br>
<p>
This assumes, of course, that a groundburst explosion on the moon will<br>
have the same underground effect as on Earth. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) all habitats would be mapped out with correct public coordinates</i><br>
<p>
What valid argument would your colony company have for keeping its<br>
location secret? Wouldn't the governments of the world be rather unhappy<br>
when they discovered just how hard you were working to prevent them from<br>
controlling you? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) that the warheads would be accurate (a big if at the velocities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; course,and distance you are talking about if you know anything about</i><br>
<i>&gt; such things)</i><br>
<p>
Well, Apollo managed an accuracy of under a mile back in the seventies. <br>
That's all a 10MT warhead would need in order to have a high probability<br>
of destroying your colony. The mass-driver, of course, is a huge target so<br>
it can easily be destroyed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Note: SDI failed not because of technical problems, but because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; politics and money.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, lack of an infinite money-pot to spend...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With boost phase, you do have an economic advantage in that with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; opponent that has MIRVed missiles, you can take out multiple warheads</i><br>
<i>&gt; with one hit, making each shot more cost effective.</i><br>
<p>
And because they're much easier to track when they're radiating MW of IR<br>
from the rocket exhaust. On the moon you won't even have a reentry plume<br>
to track them by. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Such weapons based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon with no atmospheric problems would be able to hit any target with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lunar trajectory within 10,000 miles of leaving earth.</i><br>
<p>
How are you going to track a warhead with the cross-section of a marble<br>
from 240,000 miles away!?!?!?!?! <br>
<p>
Let's suppose you have a 1GW radar beam which scans all space between the<br>
Earth and moon once a minute (and going faster would make detection<br>
harder). That means your 1GW is going into an area of about 10^15 square<br>
meters. My warhead has a radar cross-section of about 1 cm^2, so it reflects<br>
10^9 * 10^-4 * 10^-15 W. That's 10^-10 W at a distance of about 400,000<br>
km. Now, if I remember radar correctly, the reflection you receive will be <br>
10^-10 / (4*pi*(4*10^8)^2) ~ 10^-28 W/m^2. Even if you set aside 1000 square <br>
km as a receiver your signal will only be 10^-19 W. I don't believe that you <br>
can do anything useful with such a small amount of power, and a realistic <br>
value would be much lower. <br>
<p>
Now let's assume that a microwatt is enough signal to detect something.<br>
The received power will scale with the fourth power of distance, so you<br>
need to improve the signal by 10^13, or reduce the distance by a factor of<br>
<i>&gt;10^3. So your huge investment in radar technology would mean that you</i><br>
could detect my warheads from 300km, around fifty seconds before impact.<br>
If, more realistically, you can only build a 1000m^2 receiver then you'll<br>
be down to 3km, or around 0.5 seconds to impact. Even worse, if you're<br>
scanning the sky once per minute then you only have a 1% chance of detecting <br>
it before it hits.<br>
<p>
If you increase the scanning rate you're more likely to detect it, but<br>
the detection range decreases because you put out less energy in each<br>
scan. The crossover point where you're guaranteed to detect the warhead <br>
before impact is at around 200m. That's about 33 milliseconds before <br>
impact. It might even be close enough to the ground that I could <br>
detonate the bomb anyway.<br>
<p>
Of course, I launched a thousand decoys with each warhead, so you have 33 <br>
microseconds to hit each one. Each one you miss is a 1/1000 chance of <br>
losing your colony. How fast can your lasers retarget, and can they put <br>
out enough power to destroy a warhead in 33 microseconds? <br>
<p>
Not to mention that your radar transmitter would be an wonderful beacon<br>
for me to use in targetting my warheads... and if I can't do that I just<br>
blast you with a 1GW radar from Earth and use that for terrain mapping<br>
guidance in the last few seconds. I don't have to worry about the <br>
power-of-four attenuation because my receiver is a thousand times closer <br>
than the transmitter.<br>
<p>
Note: You might be able to do something with radar receivers in orbit; <br>
stealth works in a large part by scattering the radar reflections off in <br>
a direction away from the radar source. Receivers in orbit might be able to <br>
pick up some of that scattered radiation and help your tracking.<br>
<p>
Finally, I could do something clever like braking around the back of<br>
the moon to put the warhead on a low-angle ballistic trajectory towards<br>
your colony. If you're only scanning the sky in the direction of Earth,<br>
then you're history.<br>
<p>
[Phalanx]<br>
<i>&gt; This is controlled by a computer/radar/IR</i><br>
<i>&gt; control system that has been demonstrated to be VERY effective.</i><br>
<p>
But can it hit a marble in 0.000033 seconds? AFAIR the rate of fire is <br>
only about 100 rounds per second, so a single gun certainly can't. If<br>
you had one gun per incoming warhead and decoy you'd have 33 milliseconds, <br>
giving you three shots at each target. Might work, but I don't think that <br>
the US government would be willing to sell you a thousand of them ;-).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reports in the media that Patriot was wholly unsuccessful were</i><br>
<i>&gt; untrue.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I don't have my mailing list archives online, but I seem to remember<br>
that the article was reporting on a military report to a Congressional<br>
committee, so Congress might be interested to hear about it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; if the majority of the installation is underground, they would never</i><br>
<i>&gt; notice.</i><br>
<p>
High-powered lasers and radar stations won't do you much good if they're<br>
underground, and you don't need 1000m^2 of radar receiver for tracking<br>
incoming transports with a radar cross-section the size of an office<br>
block. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What in numbers of people? useless. in numbers of rocks launched by</i><br>
<i>&gt; railgun? You would not need to decimate the entire surface, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; assertion is just ludicrous.</i><br>
<p>
But you were the one who first made that assertion. You said that you<br>
could pulverize the Earth's surface before missiles from Earth hit you. I<br>
proved that even with your optimistic figures that was far from the truth. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The goal of battle is to destroy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; enemy's ability to wage and support war.</i><br>
<p>
And how do you do that with dumb rocks? How do you target military<br>
installations from 250,000 miles away with no terminal guidance? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Using estimates that the US and Russia</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the combined ability to decimate the world ten times over,</i><br>
<p>
That figure is, of course, nonsense. Realistic estimates show that even<br>
wiping out the entire population of Britain (i.e. 'decimating them ten<br>
times over') would take around 2,000 MT. That's 1/4 of your figures for<br>
the total stockpile to kill off 1% of the world's population. <br>
<p>
Even if your figures are correct, those 40,000 warheads were still not<br>
considered to be enough to wipe out all military targets! This is why they<br>
wanted even more. Of course you would only need to destroy those<br>
installations that could hit you, but that would just leave the rest of<br>
the military very pissed off. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Given our 10 kiloton clean ferrous warhead (weighing one ton), we</i><br>
<i>&gt; could decimate the world with 110,000 one ton ferrous rocks.</i><br>
<p>
But this is the problem. I don't believe your figures, and still haven't<br>
had time to find an official 'J to MT' conversion rate. The two figures I<br>
have handy are that the explosion speed of TNT is about 5500m/s and that<br>
something like 50g of antimatter is equivalent to 1MT. So that would give<br>
figures of 0.5*5500*5500 = 1.5x10^7 or 0.1 * c^2 / 10^9 = 9x10^6 J per kg<br>
of TNT. So let's say 10^7 J/kg. <br>
<p>
Freefall velocity from the moon is around 11km/s, so a minimum energy<br>
launch will give you 500 * 11000 * 11000 = 6 * 10^10 J. That's<br>
equivalent to about 6 * 10^3 kg of TNT, or 6 tons. Hence, a thousand times<br>
less than you claim. Sure you haven't got tons and kg confused? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the military industrial complex of the world covers a much smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; percentage of it surface, I'll bet that a lunar colony could decimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; the US Chinese and Russian military capability with less than 6000 rocks</i><br>
<p>
Even if that's true, you now have to increase the figure to 6,000,000, and<br>
your total to 110,000,000. In my earlier message I showed that you can<br>
launch 18,000 before forces arrive from Earth. Note, of course, that if my<br>
warheads can't target you at 6km/s, then your rocks will certainly not be<br>
able to target me at 11km/s, and decimating the military will still leave<br>
90% of them just itching to wipe you out. <br>
<p>
The fundamental problem is this: launching rocks from the moon gives you<br>
around a factor of four increase in energy from gravity. So you can put<br>
four times as much energy into Earth as you can generate. In order to hit<br>
the Earth with 60 MT worth of rocks you need to generate 15 MT equivalent<br>
of energy. That's 15 * 10^7 * 10^9 J. With a 1GW reactor to power your<br>
100% efficient mass-driver that will take you about five years.<br>
'Decimating the planet' with 1,100 MT will be impossible, because you'd<br>
need a century to launch that many rocks, in which time the population<br>
would have increased by a factor of four. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (count the installations), and that is taking into account interception</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems, giving 105 rocks to each target based on importance. Places</i><br>
<i>&gt; like NORAD control in Colorado would get some extras just for fun.</i><br>
<p>
10 ton impacts will have little effect on a base that's buried under<br>
hundreds of feet of solid rock. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, consider this: Luna could put any number of rocks up in orbit way</i><br>
<i>&gt; ahead of time, as part of its minimg operation to supply the</i><br>
<i>&gt; construction of solar sats and colonies.</i><br>
<p>
True, but six million? You really need five year's backlog of launches in<br>
space to supply construction? And what if one of those rocks is perturbed<br>
enough by some passing body or gravitational change to fall to Earth by<br>
accident? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Keeping a decent backlog of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rocks in orbit with little thruster packs would work as an excellent</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterrent system that could not be sabotaged.</i><br>
<p>
How much will six million 'little thruster packs' cost you? Lunar orbit to<br>
Earth orbit will take around 1.5 km/s, so if you have solid rockets then<br>
Mr = e^(1500/2500) ~ 1.5, and you'll need at least half a ton of current<br>
rocket fuels. At current prices that's around $15,000 per thruster, giving<br>
a total cost of at least $90 billion before we even think about<br>
electronics and other hardware. You also have to launch all those<br>
thrusters, which will take another two or three years. <br>
<p>
So by now you've spent untold billions building your colony, and all your<br>
mass-driver has done for the first eight years is stockpile rocks in orbit<br>
in case you decide to attack Earth, *and* you've spent another $90 billion<br>
on thrusters. Frankly I think your bank manager and creditors will come<br>
after you long before the US government. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your assertion that a 1 ton rock falling from lunar space to earth would</i><br>
<i>&gt; only impact with 10 tons of force is also completely laughable. You've</i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously never taken a physics course.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I have a degree in the subject, which is why your figures looked<br>
dubious and I checked them rather than taking them at face value. My<br>
calculations are publically available above; please either prove me wrong<br>
or stop claiming that you're right. The whole problem with your scenario<br>
is that your calculations are out by a factor of 1000, which invalidates<br>
the whole scheme. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Force equals mass times</i><br>
<i>&gt; acceleration ( for which (end velocity^2)/2 can be substituted). Using</i><br>
<i>&gt; gravity, a 1 ton rock accelerates at an average of .5 G for over 150,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles (assuming a negligible velocity near the L1 point where Earth and</i><br>
<i>&gt; lunar gravity forces are equal). Falling falling falling.</i><br>
<p>
And if you do the integration the answer is around 11km/s. As I used in<br>
the calculations above. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; no. safer for the inhabitants (as they will be less likely to be hit by</i><br>
<i>&gt; collateral damage).</i><br>
<p>
Which collateral damage? Your mass-driver is there to launch rocks for<br>
construction of habitats, not as a weapon! You seem to think that you can<br>
run your commercial colony on a war footing 24 hours a day, 365 days a<br>
year. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Look at Area 51</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a good example.</i><br>
<p>
You mean that place that everyone knows about and of which aerial photos<br>
have even been included with plastic kits of stealth planes? <br>
<p>
[Commie Infiltrators]<br>
<i>&gt; They didn't get every secret,</i><br>
<p>
They got everything they needed to build a precise duplicate of the<br>
American bombs. At one stage they were collecting so much classified<br>
information from all over America (not just on nukes) that they had to<br>
ship it out by the plane-load! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are also not</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding the dynamic of the people involved on the moon. ANyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; forced off earth will feel toward earthgov as Cuban Expatriates in Miami</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel toward Fidel Castro. How many of them would spy for old Fidel?</i><br>
<p>
Uh, are we talking about completely different things here? First your<br>
colony was a commercial venture to build space habitats, now it's some<br>
kind of prison, presumably run from Earth. Which is it? If it's a company<br>
then most people probably won't want to kill their relatives on Earth, and<br>
if it's a prison then they won't be able to build the kind of hardware<br>
that you're talking about. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; True, but fortunately, every credit agency in the world is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence agency for hire. you can learn A LOT from a persons credit</i><br>
<i>&gt; record.</i><br>
<p>
And every credit agency in America cooperates with the US government as<br>
part of the Witness Protection Program. Do you really think they don't do<br>
the same for CIA agents? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ALso, the kind of Americans likely to migrate to the moon are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not likely to resemble candidates for CIA training. (not many Yale</i><br>
<i>&gt; yuppies digging moon dirt)</i><br>
<p>
Most of the people working on the moon would be engineers or scientists.<br>
The original L5 studies (I presume you have read 'The High Frontier'?)<br>
showed that their mass-driver could be continually fed with one bulldozer. <br>
Doesn't leave much opportunity for unskilled dirt-diggers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No wonder we are having this argument, you haven't even studied the</i><br>
<i>&gt; preparation material. What would your professors have said? Read it then</i><br>
<i>&gt; come back.</i><br>
<p>
I don't need to, I know the basic plot because it's been discussed so <br>
many times before. I just want to know more about the specifics.<br>
