Interesting.  When I published the suggestion, in 1971, that cryonicists<br>
could freeze severed heads instead of going to the expense and added risk<br>
of storing the whole body (a process now called `neurological suspension',<br>
and in which I was anticipated in print by several years), I suggested that<br>
the spinal cord should also be preserved.  It seemed to me then (and still<br>
does) that a considerable amount of salient information is embodied/encoded<br>
therein.  This would also be relevant, therefore, to upload procedures.<br>
