<i>&gt; Its odd that you and I can agree here but have different views on</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property. What I am proposing is that intellectual property</i><br>
<i>&gt; be fully recognized as a basic human right (part of the natural law</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing), possibly THE basic human right, and that patents, copyrights,</i><br>
<i>&gt; trademarks etc are merely government recognition of individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; exercising these rights in acts of creation. </i><br>
<p>
You are asking far more than that; you are asking not only that I<br>
recognize your right to use your creation, but that I further give<br>
you the power to use force to prevent anyone else from using it, even<br>
if it was independently created, or given freely.  You don't want a<br>
right to use your mind; you want permission to use your fists to<br>
prevent me from using /my/ mind.<br>
<p>
"Property" is a human right by virtue of the objective nature of it:<br>
that a piece of property cannot simultaneously serve the ends of two<br>
different people.  If you want to expand that to include things that<br>
/can/ simultaneously be used by everyone, then give me a /reason/, not<br>
just your feeling that it is "natural".<br>
