Improving the body includes improving the mind, and to a limited extent,<br>
even if no modifications are made directly to the brain itself.  Besides, I<br>
think *most* extropians want to improve their minds.  In fact, I think this<br>
is one of THE primary characteristics of extropians.  <br>
<p>
What good is universal power and physical omnipotence if the total<br>
experience exceeds the useable bandwidth of the mind?  Most of us recognize<br>
the distinct need for more cognitive power and improved cognitive structure.<br>
I know I do, and most of us already have more cognitive abilities than the<br>
average person.<br>
<p>
I might even go so far as to submit that cognitive improvements are the only<br>
improvement of fundamental value, and by the same token are the limiting<br>
factors to continued future advancements.<br>
