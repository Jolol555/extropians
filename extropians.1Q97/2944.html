<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Given the frequency with which candidates break promises ("Read my</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;How about posting a bond that you lose if you break your promise?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Compared to most political promises, this should be relatively easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;verify that it was broken.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;are making now? There appears to be plenty of demand for the benefits</i><br>
<i>&gt;it would provide, and I can't see any obstacles that deter its use.</i><br>
<p>
Two theories come to mind:<br>
1.  Voters really don't want to elect a leader whose hands are tied in<br>
this manner.  They know these promises are just cheap talk, they don't<br>
take them any more seriously than that, and that's they way they like it.<br>
2.  Being the first to make a promise like this would flag you as<br>
someone who thinks we won't trust you, and as someone with an ususual<br>
fascination and trust in monetary incentives.  Looks too weird.<br>
