I would disagree with your concept of property.  Inventions, techniques,<br>
etc. are patented b/c the represent the the intensive work product of an<br>
individual.  To steal this workproduct without the permission of the one<br>
who truly created it would be tantamount to taking credit for something<br>
you did not create (plagirism or using a trademark).<br>
    Not having a system of protections for these future oriented people<br>
would give the lazy and oportunistic the right to benefit from the work<br>
of others - not a very libertarian concept.  Besides, patents expire<br>
(voila IBM clones) giving others the right to benefit from the<br>
advancement, but also giving the individual(s) their just rewards.<br>
