Extropians,  Thanks for your thoughtful responses to my recent postings<br>
about Environmental issues on this list which were my debut in this<br>
learned forum.  Ideologically I consider myself an inquisitive person<br>
who wants to view issues from many different perspectives and so forums<br>
such as this are my natural element.<br>
<p>
<p>
                  In the past few years, I have been a member of various<br>
environmental forums.  Deep Ecology, Ecopsychology, Abbeyweb,  ISHMAEL<br>
etc. have been the ones that I subscribed to  for various durations.<br>
There was much wisdom and much foolishness to be found in these mailing<br>
lists.  Many environmentally minded people have an unhealthy<br>
technophobia.  An exception is the environmental poet and philosopher<br>
Gary Snyder who has an Internet access and e-mail at the University of<br>
Calif. Davis.  Gary Snyder and other environmentalists are also on the<br>
Global Business Network, seeking answers to tough questions.  It is with<br>
this sort of mentality that I would want to approach environmental<br>
problems.<br>
<p>
Julian Simon is a sort of court jester.  If anyone falls for his ideas,<br>
well I got a bridge to sell you.  He is so transparent.  And the<br>
organizations he belongs to lobby to do away with environmental<br>
regulations on industry.  I watched them numerous times on C-SPANN.  One<br>
got their seed money from a certain brewery in Colorado which has not<br>
endeared itself to environmentalists.<br>
<p>
Greg Burch, your postings and Extropian environmental homepage are<br>
great.  I am planning on going to Alaska this summer so I won't make<br>
your New Mexico backpacking hike.  I was in New Mexico last summer.<br>
<p>
<p>
