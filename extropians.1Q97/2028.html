Nice try, but you're seeing the "system by whatever name" from the inside,<br>
whereas I am seeing it from the outside to my advantage. For example, you<br>
are expressing by quoting sentiments such as the above you are doing<br>
stirring almost patriotic fervor. Someone would think that you view money<br>
as an actual finite resource not to be wasted or loose value. Heck, if the<br>
people who print it for a fee thought it was valuable wouldn't they be<br>
trying to keep its value up.<br>
<p>
There are new ways of finding communication value other than in price, and<br>
that don't jeopardize safety. (which I trust is of paramount value to this<br>
discussion)<br>
