<i>&gt; The original topic of discussion was reason vis a vis emotion. Are</i><br>
<i>&gt; you now contending that emotion is unreal? I think your original</i><br>
<i>&gt; contention was that reason has a valid principal role to play in</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognition, and that emotion has no role to play in cognition.</i><br>
<p>
"Emotion is unreal"?  That's just so completely contradictory<br>
to what I said that I can only say "read me again."<br>
<p>
As for emotional response having no role to play in cognition,<br>
I probably did leave that impression, but there are clearly<br>
counterexamples that I must face.  For example, there are<br>
data to show that stress improves memory.  The same chemical<br>
reactions that produce stress response also trigger the brain<br>
to say "hey, this is important, remember this".  It can be<br>
simulated with drugs: a shot of adrenaline while viewing a<br>
scene aids in remembering it; beta blockers make it harder.<br>
<p>
So in that sense, it is clear that "emotions"--which we will<br>
have to identify ostensively for now lacking more precise<br>
definition--"have a role to play" in cognition, to the extent<br>
that they affect it.  I am also well aware that the esthetic<br>
value of ideas can guide one into which areas to research.<br>
<p>
All I am trying to say is that there must be a final arbiter<br>
of what to call "knowledge", and that however emotion may have<br>
helped or hindered the process of getting there, somebody has<br>
to be the last guard at the gate.  Right now, I have given<br>
those keys to a guy called "reason", because he has served me<br>
well.  The vast torrent of concepts and percepts may compete<br>
among themselves by any means available, but whatever winners<br>
come to the gate of knowledge, only one test lets them in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Consistency" has a clear and precise meaning in the study of formal</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems, and you are banking on that meaning. But "consistency", as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; relation between "knowledge" and "conscious experience of reality" is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; radically unclear notion. This is not a definition of a poorly</i><br>
<i>&gt; understood notion in simpler and better understood terms; this is just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; postponement. Both "knowledge" and "conscious experience of reality"</i><br>
<i>&gt; refer to information processes within human brains that we have barely</i><br>
<i>&gt; begun to grasp. (Emotions are another example of information processes</i><br>
<i>&gt; within human brains that we have barely begun to grasp.)</i><br>
<p>
I cannot disagree, but until that understanding comes, I'm stuck<br>
with what I have.  If someone finds a more precise definition of<br>
knowledge or better methods judging reality, his burden is simple:<br>
show me.  Demonstrate to my senses that your understanding can<br>
accomplish more than mine.  Invent some things.  Walk on water.<br>
Cure cancer.  Don't just yell at me "You don't understand!", and<br>
walk away, because I'll ignore you and get on with my work to the<br>
best of my current ability.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;In judging methods,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;consistency is required, completeness not.  I.e., any method that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;produces false knowledge even once is out,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Science produces such "false knowledge" all the time... and then moves</i><br>
<i>&gt; on and corrects it. (Once again, my harping on the luminiferous ether.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is science then not to be understood as an instance of reason?</i><br>
<p>
Science never produces false knowledge, because it never produces /any/<br>
knowledge.  Scientists are generally skeptics, afraid to commit to<br>
anything.  Scientists say things like "Our current best understanding,<br>
based on these data, is..."  What I have called "knowledge" in the<br>
foregoing discussion is what a scientist calls "data", but not quite.<br>
The conclusions drawn from that are useful, justifiable, guesses that<br>
can be used to accomplish things, but I'm not sure I would elevate<br>
them quite to the level of "knowledge".  Perhaps we need more words<br>
for these fine distinctions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, they are not. But you don't seem to realize that encouraging people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to operate within the tradition of Reason is a very different thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; from encouraging them to use a screwdriver instead of a hammer. Our</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts are informed by varying degrees of careful study of reality;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "oxidation" is better informed in this way than "phlogiston" is. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; contention is that "reason" is a traditional concept that has evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt; through the use of words, and not a concept that has itself emerged from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the careful and direct study of reality. We are only recently embarking</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the kind of empirical study of brains and neurocomputational</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes that *might* yield a scientific concept that would warrant the</i><br>
<i>&gt; precision and semantic force that you are asking of "reason".</i><br>
<p>
Like I said, when you find something better, show me.  I do not deny<br>
that it might exist, I only state what I have seen to be the best so far,<br>
and since 90% of the population hasn't even accepted that yet, and there<br>
is still much to be accomplished with it, I find it more profitable to<br>
invest my time in reason as I know it than in speculation about something<br>
better, until I find some limitation of it to inspire the search.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; that words cannot hurt people. This is an attitude that I would *expect*</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; to find only among those who are accustomed to using physical force to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; hurt people.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Interesting.  Hate to blow your theory, but I've never thrown a punch</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in my life, never owned a gun, and am utterly repulsed by violence.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This doesn't blow my "theory", since it contained no assertions about you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Besides, I deliberately expressed it as a mere expectation and not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, so that you wouldn't think I was trying to take a cheap shot at</i><br>
<i>&gt; you. But apparently you thought so anyway. I wonder why?</i><br>
<p>
All I meant was, "Interesting speculation, here's a counterexample.",<br>
nothing more.  Why would you think I saw it as a "cheap shot"?  I saw<br>
it as a speculation, just as you intended.  Look closely at that<br>
sentence "This is an attitude...".  It is short and to the point, has<br>
no extraneous adjectives, no connotation-loaded nouns, and is clearly<br>
worded as a guess.  It is not possible for me to interpret that as a<br>
cheap shot if I undestand English correctly, yet you expected me to<br>
take it that way, and even thought I did when I didn't (I admit that<br>
my reply was not so carefully worded and might be misinterpreted, but<br>
it certainly didn't say that I took it that way).<br>
<p>
That is a fascinating example of miscommunication, though, isn't it?<br>
Thank you for arranging that, however unintentionally.  I'm not sure <br>
what relevance it has to our discussion, but it is enlightening.  Maybe<br>
I'll start spending more time learning Lojban, or write a book on it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, yes, I love a good fight myself. That's why I'm giving you one. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; you should be able to distinguish between someone who is seeking an</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggressive argument and someone who is seeking a cooperative discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Both can be carried on as positive-sum-games, but why limit yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; only to exchanging information with people who like aggressive argument?</i><br>
<p>
That's an interesting idea.  I'll have to think about that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I guess what I'm fighting for is the idea of context-sensitivity in</i><br>
<i>&gt; these things. I am not interested in debating the morality of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; topics right now: morality is an immense field of study in its own</i><br>
<i>&gt; right. What I am wondering is how you could possibly believe that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your or anyone else's interest for you to close off the mind you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; addressing by provoking negative emotional reactions in em? </i><br>
<p>
If an honest expression causes someone to "close off" his mind, then<br>
that fact in itself is dangerous and needs to be dealt with.  I suspect<br>
the opposite: I suspect that a shocking fact or opinion actually draws<br>
attention to itself and increases the chance of the listener really<br>
thinking about it.  Maybe I'll call it the Geraldo effect :)<br>
