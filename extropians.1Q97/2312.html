<i>&gt; I think far too many people pretend beliefs they do not have in order to </i><br>
<i>&gt; fit in. The worst thing isn't the hypocricy (quite often it is necessary </i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to remain in the group) but the fact that make believe beliefs </i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to rub off. We tend to start to believe in what we say, regardless </i><br>
<i>&gt; of what we say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How to deal with this? Being more open about what we think will cause </i><br>
<i>&gt; more friction, and in some cases might even be counterproductive, but in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the long run I think it is healthier to decrease the dissonance between </i><br>
<i>&gt; what we really think and what we say we think. It also promotes others to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be more open, if they know you can tolerate their divergent opinions. </i><br>
<p>
Well said, but as usual I would put it much more strongly: Anyone whose<br>
relationship with you is so fragile that expressing your honest beliefs<br>
might jeopardize your friendship is no friend.  Such a relationship can<br>
be of no benefit to you, and if your honesty ends it, then it has saved<br>
you time and energy that you might more profitably invest in a healthy<br>
relationship elsewhere.<br>
<p>
Likewise, if your friend has some psycological need for your approval of<br>
his ideas, your acquiescence is no benefit to him; it only serves to<br>
feed his neurosis.<br>
<p>
Of course, this applies mainly to voluntary relationships.  There are<br>
certain externally-imposed relationships like close family, roommates,<br>
and business associates that may require different treatment.  I tend to<br>
deal with these mostly by treating them as obstacles to be worked around.<br>
I do not loudly proclaim my atheism to my Baptist minister uncle, but<br>
nor have I had to deny it--I simply don't let our conversations turn to<br>
that.  I simply acknowledge that my time is better spent developing my<br>
voluntary relationships (which, happily, include my parents, my sister,<br>
and my rommate (though not all of their spouses, alas).  I have never<br>
needed to express a belief I don't hold, though I have often had to bite<br>
my tongue and quietly move to a different conversation.<br>
