<i>&gt;  &gt;You could now run for office on a platform that if elected, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;will replace yourself with a randomly selected member of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;electorate.  Since people do not now run on such platforms, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;suspect that voters do not in fact trust such a random person to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;do as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is bad evidence, because legislators cannot replace themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; with whomever they like. In the US federal House of Representatives,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a legislator can resign at will, but the replacement is chosen by</i><br>
<i>&gt; a special election called by the executive authority of the state</i><br>
<i>&gt; from which the legislator was elected. Similar schemes are in effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; in most other polities with representative legislatures.</i><br>
<p>
You could, however, run on the platform that you would randomly<br>
select some citizen and allow him to make all your voting decisions.<br>
That would at least work until you were recalled (which I think<br>
would be likely).  I am still not optimistic that those votes would<br>
be any less heinous than those of an elected official himself--in<br>
fact, I'm quite sure they would not be.  The masses today believe<br>
in all kinds of nonsense.<br>
<p>
When I lived in Seattle, a man changed his name to "Absolutely<br>
Nobody" and ran for Lieutenant Governor.  He promised that if he<br>
were elected, he would return his salary and never show up for work.<br>
There's a tweak to democracy I might support--a definite step in<br>
the right direction.<br>
<p>
It also served to allow me to say something to our LP candidate<br>
that one rarely gets to say--"Congratulations, Tom, nobody got more<br>
votes than you did."<br>
