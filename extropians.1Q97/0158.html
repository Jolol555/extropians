<i>&gt; wrote an essay titled "Collectivist anarchy vs. Individualist anarchy".</i><br>
<i>&gt; In it he described his idea of a collectivist or socialistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchy vs. a individualistic and misnamedly capitalistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchy.  I think he had his definitions mixed up, however, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll attempt to set the record straight.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Anarcho-syndicalism looks to me like "Anarcho-communism, communism without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the state" or because communism is though of a state, more accurately:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spontaneous socialism/ collectivist anarchy. AKA Libertarian-socialism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is more or less true, however, what is left out is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-syndicalism, or libertarian socialism, is not a philosophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; based on altruism but in fact on rational, enlightened self-interest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are in fact both win-win, and lose-win situations in a socialistic</i><br>

I am 30 years old and fairly new to the extropian movement.  I come from<br>
the <br>
standard Libertarian viewpoint of:  Yes, I want a goverment.  One whose<br>
only purpose <br>
is to help me protect my individual rights.  The ten two-word phrases<br>
I've listed <br>
above seem contradictory to me.  Are these phrases important parts of<br>
the Extropian <br>
movements? I ask this out of sheer ignorance.  The only one of these<br>
phrases that I <br>
remember reading in the extropian FAQ's was Anarcho-capitalism. I<br>
remember similar <br>
phrases to these in one of those early-20th-century-Union-Movement<br>
books.  From what I<br>
understand, every "ism" mentioned above wants a gov't to do certain<br>
things for them.<br>
Has this usage changed? Is it assumed that Trans/Posthumans will not<br>
take actions that <br>
affect individual rights, for good or bad? Won't Trans/Posthumans try to<br>
create<br>
organizations to deal with (and/or deal *out*) use of force? In my<br>
jargon these<br>
organizations are called governments..whether they are corporate,<br>
dictatorial,<br>
constitutional, democratic, etc..<br>
<p>
(snip)<br>
<i>&gt; To expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalists to "hold themselves back" from making profits because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; harms other besides themselves (and even themselves in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; LONG run),</i><br>
<p>
How does an individual improve his existence without profit?  How is<br>
profiting harmful to others? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is to expect capitalists to be altruistic, and of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they cannot be, because the capitalist meme is forever at war against</i><br>
<i>&gt; any altruist meme. (except, in the case of FDR style liberal</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism.. also called "social democracy).</i><br>
<p>
I wish this were true.  I've never seen any corporate leader (alive<br>
today)<br>
blatantly attack altruism at its philosophical roots...actually<br>
attacking the meme "altruism".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Collectivist anarchy and Individualist anarchy vs "anarcho-" capitalism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are two groups of Libertarians: the Spontaneous</i><br>
<i>&gt; Socialists (Collectivist anarchy) and the Individualist Anarchists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is another group, the so-called anarcho-capitalists, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they in fact are one of the current incarnations of a form</i><br>
<i>&gt; of liberalism that existed before the more common Liberalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the post-FDR years.  This type of "liberalism" bases it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; "liberal" emphasis on the fact that it opposes the State and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Church as entities that control capital.   It does not,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, have much to say about liberty of labor, or the rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; of individuals in the labor force, beyond that they have the "choice"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of whom to take order from, or the opportunity to become a boss</i><br>
<i>&gt; and give orders to someone else.</i><br>
<p>
You either produce the products you want for life's enjoyment yourself <br>
or you get them from some other source.  That other source wants<br>
something <br>
in return.  This is why the Customer/boss gives orders.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first group is where Rudolf Rocker, Noam Chomsky</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Gregory P. Maximoff stand. A common misconception is that their</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems are based on the illegalization of private property.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not true.  anarcho-syndicalism, or libertarian socialism, is based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on working class individualists putting their own self-interests</i><br>
<i>&gt; first and _abandoning_ the system of private property that</i><br>
<i>&gt; exploits them.</i><br>
<p>
I like private property. I've put alot of effort to acquire the private<br>
property<br>
that I own (no real estate yet). Abandoning my private property is not<br>
in my<br>
self-interest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The survival of such a group is not based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; "expelling" win-lose meme private property people, but rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; in keeping the win-win libertarian socialist people.</i><br>
<p>
If the word "socialist" still means he who offers or receives<br>
self-sacrifice,<br>
then a libertarian socialist (huh?) is operating on a win-loose (at<br>
best) meme.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; This group does not force itself to not see the "win-win" aspects</i><br>
<i>&gt; of capitalism: it's pretty obvious that there are some win-win</i><br>
<i>&gt; transactions, where two powerful capitalists might make a transaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; and each side be satisfied... however, what they recognize is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there is ALWAYS a win-lose side to capitalism in how workers</i><br>
<i>&gt; are treated.</i><br>
<p>
If it's truly a capitalist society, then the worker is free to get up<br>
and leave.<br>
But, if he expects to consume goods and services, someone will have to<br>
produce them.<br>
If he expects someone else to produce for him, he'll have to pay the<br>
producer. As we see from today's America: if you set up a system where<br>
you don't pay the Piper, the vermin take over.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Individualist and Socialistic anarchy are not fundamentally different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some capitalist theorists have argued that capitalism is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individualist philosophy based on the idea that the "individual"</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalist is pitted against the "mass" of workers.  But the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality is that it is the individual worker against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual boss.  </i><br>
<p>
My model pits my resources against my desire to live and enjoy life. <br>
It's a battle I would rather not fight without the ability to trade<br>
(division of labor and all that).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The model of "mass" representing the left,</i><br>
<i>&gt; something boosted by Stalinist ideology, only helped re-enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the illusion of "individual" on the capitalist side.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the early individualist anarchists were not in favor of capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; per se, they were simply opposed to mass state organizations like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Communist Party.  Individualist-leaning philosophers like Thomas Jefferson,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Adam Smith, Lysander Spooner, Henry David Thoreau, Max Stirner and so on</i><br>
<i>&gt; all believed that workers had fundamental rights, and the right to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; fair share of labor... but they had to claim it themselves, through</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own efforts, and through acts of resistance, strikes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and civil disobedience.. not by imposing ones will on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalist individual, but by refusing to be exploited by the capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual.  Take the delemma of the con-man: he has only his</i><br>
<i>&gt; wits to rely on.. no money, no resources: just his mind.  His</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer to those who wail "how could you trick and exploit me!?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is: "You allowed it to happen to yourself."  Libertarian Socialism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or anarcho-syndicalism is no more and no less than the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; of no longer permitting oneself to be conned, used, exploited, coerced,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or tricked. Not by a capitalistic boss, or a political party "leader".</i><br>
<p>
Jamal, I have to disagree with you on this.  This paragraph equates<br>
free, voluntary trade with fraud, theft and coercion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another name for libertarian socialists might be "Laissez-Faire</i><br>
<i>&gt; Socialists": the saying goes that if a group of libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers were approached by a government official who asked them</i><br>
<i>&gt; "what can I do for you?", the answer would be "leave us alone:</i><br>
<i>&gt; labor united can solve it's own problems".  The Communist and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Socialist parties turned to electorialism and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; state as a tool to solve the working class's problems... but</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian and individualist anarchists historically</i><br>
<i>&gt; rejected this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Laissez-Faire Socialists (individualist and syndicalist anarchy)</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe people like to work hard and get paid fairly for it. Win-win...</i><br>
<i>&gt; (though capitalists often force themselves to refuse to see the win-win</i><br>
<i>&gt; aspect of such a situation and only see it as win-lose, thus opposing</i><br>
<i>&gt; working-class individuals who ask for nothing more than freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt; from exploitation)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
What is a Laissez-Faire Socialist?<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Libertarian Socialism/ anarcho-syndicalism encourages people to work and</i><br>
<i>&gt; be paid a fair wage (WIN-WIN) when they are employed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Libertarian socialism assumes people own their own bodies, unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt; "anarcho-capitalism" where the individual is "owned" by the corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt; they work for. In "anarcho-" capitalist society human behavior is regulated</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the imposition of regulatory patents, copyright laws, and so on.</i><br>
<p>
Who owns the property in Libertarian Socialism.  Can I produce and trade<br>
as I please?  Does socialism not imply the existence of a State that<br>
owns the means of production?  I'm getting the feeling that I'm actually<br>
responding to some "Initiation meme/post".  <br>
OK guys, you caught me with my mouth open, ha, ha!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW, Fascism is a form extreme capitalism. Fascism occours when small business</i><br>
<i>&gt; owners, frightened of a rising, militant and organised working class,</i><br>
<i>&gt; turn to the extreme right which uses workerist rhetoric and emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt; appeals to build a counter-revolutionary movement to stop the spread</i><br>
<i>&gt; of (libertarian) socialist ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dynamically Optimistic,</i><br>
