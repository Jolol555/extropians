Jim,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Please explain what you mean here, because my mind has no referent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for the word "economics" that comes anywhere close to the attributes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you assign to it here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Avarice &gt; self-interest &gt; Economics</i><br>
<p>
If self-interest is "bad" than does this mean that good is "society's<br>
interest", "the government's interest", or perhaps "your interests".<br>
Exactly whose interest are you going to substitute for self-interest?<br>
And while we're at it who's going to enforce whatever interest is going<br>
to take the place of self-interest?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example, when powerful enough we'll kick-down the media with education</i><br>
<i>&gt; first, then by randomly declaring 'free days' where no explicit money can</i><br>
<p>
Likewise who's going to enforce these no-money days, and will they be<br>
using guns?  I really don't feel that we're going to trancend self-interest<br>
or achieve any kind of unity by going out and kicking-down this or that.<br>
