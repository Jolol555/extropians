<i>&gt; Hal comments:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A commercial jet flying at 10000 m will therefore have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;speedup due to GR of about 10^-10.  This is an order of magnitude more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than the relativistic slowdown of even the mile per second plane, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it will swamp that effect in normal situations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This has been an empirical issue for many years.  A quick hunt of my shelves</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not locate the detailed account, which I recall showed a (very small)</i><br>
<i>&gt; overall loss of time in the airborne clock.  Britannica says: `The</i><br>
<i>&gt; clock-paradox effect also has been substantiated by experiments comparing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the elapsed time of an atomic clock on Earth with that of an atomic clock</i><br>
<i>&gt; flown in an airplane.  The latter experiments. furthermore, have confirmed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gravitational contribution to time dilation, as predicted by the theory of</i><br>
<i>&gt; general relativity.'  No plus or minus signs, damn it, but presumably if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; joint effect had conformed with Hal's estimate this would have deserved</i><br>
<i>&gt; mention in the EB.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, I made a numerical error and used a value of c that was a<br>
factor of 10 too low.  Actually g/c^2 is about 10^-16 per meter and<br>
so at 10000 m the gravitational speedup would be 10^-12.  This puts<br>
the relativistic slowdown back in the lead since it was about 10^-11,<br>
although Eliezer's plane was going pretty darn fast (nearly at orbital<br>
velocity).  For ordinary commercial jets it looks like the relativistic<br>
slowdown just about cancels the gravitational speedup!<br>
