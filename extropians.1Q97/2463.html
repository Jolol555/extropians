<i>&gt; &gt; A person has will, and can act for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; his own benefit.  When you create "society", and assign it rights, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have given rights to an entity with no means or will to exercise them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and no way to benefit from them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "no means or will"? A society is an organisation. An organisation can</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily have a free will. Or perhaps you mean that an individual is aways</i><br>
<i>&gt; more powerfull than organisations? </i><br>
<p>
I did word that badly.  Yes, a complex enough organization can behave<br>
as if it has "will"; we ourselves are such organizations, and when we<br>
collect enough of us with diverse drives to work collectively, the<br>
results of those interactions can appear willful.  What I object to is<br>
the assignment of "rights" to this organization, because history shows<br>
me that doing so is always detrimental to the individuals--all of them.<br>
Because physical resources are limited, they must be allocated.  To<br>
allocate some to "society" requires taking them from individuals.  If<br>
doing so was a positive value to some individuals, they would willingly<br>
do so--the fine tradition of private charity bears this out.  But<br>
democratic policies take those resources by force, and therefore by<br>
definition are unaccountable for their use.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How have you been compassionate recently as an individual? </i><br>
<p>
I, and all libertarians I know, are very compassionate people.  I<br>
take care of my friends and family, I support charities (only private<br>
ones), I have done volunteer work, and I perform the single, most<br>
fundamentally moral, socially responsible act there is: I earn an<br>
honest living, by voluntary contract.  I do not steal from others,<br>
either by robbery of by vote.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The faster technolgy progresses the less the libertarian ideas will work</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the common man. It will turn the world into a place where a technoelite</i><br>
<i>&gt; owns the mean of production. When technology makes it possible for the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; talented people to do allmost everything what will then happen to the not</i><br>
<i>&gt; so talented?</i><br>
<p>
They will be fabulously wealthy by today's standards, just as the poorest<br>
Americans today are wealthy by their ancestors' standards.  They will<br>
enjoy the benefits of all the technology produced by those elites, and<br>
they will probably continue to complain about the injustice of the system<br>
that created them, and continue to fight it with pretty words like<br>
"equality" and "democracy", while continuing to enact policies that result<br>
in the exact opposite results.<br>
