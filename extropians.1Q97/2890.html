Lee Daniel Crocker responded:<br>
<i>&gt;It is likely that agencies would pool some of their resources for</i><br>
<i>&gt;defense.  That would be part of their cost of service.  Free riders</i><br>
<i>&gt;are likely to be a very small problem: first, because "going armadillo",</i><br>
<i>&gt;i.e., not hiring a protection agency, leaves you vulnerable to all</i><br>
<i>&gt;kinds of mischief.  </i><br>
<p>
The question is what prevents someone from starting a new PPL which<br>
protects you from local crime, and makes the appropriate agreements<br>
with other PPLs, but doesn't contribute to this defense "pool".  <br>
<p>
I also wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; More severely, it might notice when no other law was patrolling the</i><br>

<i>&gt; other customers.  The competing law might know it would cost it more</i><br>
<i>&gt; to compensate this with more monitoring, or retaliatory accidents, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; so be persuaded to leave the area. </i><br>
<p>
Lee responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Predation is a more expensive strategy than cooperation.  It makes more</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense for agencies to contract with each other for arbitration than to</i><br>
<i>&gt;risk going to war.</i><br>
<p>
I describe a concrete scenario, and you respond with a slogan.   Sure<br>
predation is expensive, but the threat of predation can be cheap.  <br>
