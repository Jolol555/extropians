Tony Csoka asked, "Have you been able to significantly increase you <br>
mathematical ability through mental traing? Also, do you believe there is any <br>
aspect of intelligence that is more difficult to improve than others?"<br>
<p>
Math is something I really enjoy doing, so I've done a lot of work with that, <br>
and my mathematical abilities are significantly greater than they ever have <br>
been.  The complexity of problems I'm able to solve and the speed with which <br>
I'm able to solve them keeps increasing the more I practice my math skills.  <br>
After a while, I start picking up on little tricks and shortcuts and develop <br>
more advanced thinking tools, and problems start seeming a lot easier.  Also, <br>
just doing some problems makes it easier to do similar problems.  <br>
<p>
What I'm working on now, with my math, and this can be applied to lots of <br>
other areas too, is to stop hesitating so much between steps.  I have the <br>
unfortunate habit of interrupting myself when I am working on a problem and <br>
pausing frequently.  I want to train myself to just do the problem straight <br>
through, in one swift, fluid motion.  It is hard for me to break this habit, <br>
but I am getting better, and I am getting faster at solving problems, as a <br>
result.<br>
<p>
Regarding the second question; yes, some cognitive abilities are harder to <br>
improve than others.  Generally, when I'm not very good at something and don't <br>
have much experience using an ability, it is very difficult to improve my <br>
ability.  But the more I work at it, the easier it gets to improve my ability <br>
in that area.  From watching myself, it seems like learning a new ability is <br>
very much about creating an internal language that is appropriate for that <br>
ability.  At first it takes a lot of experience to even find general <br>
principles which are accurate, but once those are noticed, they become symbols <br>
and it becomes easier to think about an analyze the ability.  As more <br>
experience is gained, my internal vocabulary regarding that area of ability <br>
continues to grow and my internal dialogue becomes more and more complex in <br>
that area and it builds on itself faster.  Also, I start seeing relationships <br>
between what I am learning in one area and what I have learned in another <br>
area, and I can transfer the old knowledge to the new area.  By the way, the <br>
internal language I develop when I learn new things is very different (at <br>
least superficially) to spoken language; there are no sounds to represent the <br>
symbols, so they are not anything I can communicate easily to other people, <br>
but I know what I mean when I think them.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that every cognitive ability can be improved significantly with <br>
practice.  The level of difficulty seems to depend on how familiar one is with <br>
the ability and with how strongly one is motivated to improve it.  Also, it <br>
depends on how appropriately one goes about improving the particular ability; <br>
each one requires a different approach to improve.<br>
