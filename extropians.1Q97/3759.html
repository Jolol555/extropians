I spent this past weekend at a conference in Munich, Germany discussing why<br>
Europe is undergoing a "Big Fatigue" while the USA seems so much more<br>
vibrant. Reading one of Reilly's posts just now prompted me to relate this:<br>
<p>
The first speaker on Saturday, an extropic artist from the UK presented his<br>
ideas clearly and refreshingly. He was followed by Dieter Kamper -- the man<br>
responsible for introducing postmodernism to Germany, I'm told. I wish<br>
Reilly had been there, heavily armed to save us from boredom. :-)  Kamper,<br>
as I would predict from his intellectual approach, was utterly<br>
incomprensible. I thought it might be a poor transation, but my Germany<br>
writer and extropian sympathizer Gundolf Freyermuth (his last book was<br>
Cyberland) confirmed that it was the content not the language that was the<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
Another amusing incident: After I gave my talk on Sunday on extropian ideas<br>
and how they were much stronger in the USA (esp. California) than in<br>
Europe, a Brit called Paul Treanor attacked me in quite a nasty way. This<br>
fellow thought that old technologies should be subsidized to keep their<br>
producers in business, and that free market people are the scum of the<br>
earth. He said that he could bear the thought of people like me existing so<br>
long as we were all in California. <br>
<p>
What really amused me was his own talk. In Ayn Rand's novels, the bad guys<br>
generally match their ugly ideas with some kind of physical repulsiveness.<br>
Perhaps it's just my childish glee, but I couldn't help finding it fitting<br>
that Treanor's entropic ideas were presented with a really unpleasant wet<br>
nasal sound!<br>
<p>
I enjoyed meeting List subscriber Eugene Leitl. Since a couple of women who<br>
live in Munich came up to say they enjoyed my talk, perhaps Eugene will<br>
have someone he can talk to off the Net now...<br>
