<i>&gt;What do you mean by "city"?  My impression is that in large urban U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;inner cities, the police is not very accountable to the local</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens, who are in fact largely armed.  Here there does seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;scope for substantial improvement by having a more local "subcity"</i><br>
<i>&gt;police with laws and enforcement chosen by locals to be tuned to local</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumstances.</i><br>
<p>
I would agree.  A city needs to be fairly small for the government and its<br>
agents to be "us", even in a democracy.  I think 50,000 - 100,000 seems to be<br>
the upper limit.  I haven't personally analyzed the exact numbers, but the<br>
current planned communities going up around here (Orange County, CA)<br>
generally plan for about 50,000, so I figure that's a good number.  Modern<br>
metropoli of 1 Meg or more are certainly too big.<br>
<p>
Inner cities have additional problems, in that they often have weak civil<br>
societies and business communities.  No, I don't have any pat answers for<br>
these kinds of problems; in the absence of an outside state I see<br>
difficulties in their creating either a functional traditional community<br>
police or a "police-for-hire" situation.  The situation there with an<br>
external state supposedly enforcing laws is pretty gruesome as well.<br>
