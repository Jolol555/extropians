Lee, where can I find out more about Anarcho-capitalism. It seems at<br>
first and second glance to be a self-contradicting term but I'd like to<br>
see what its principles are. Does it exclude property rights? I'd also<br>
like to read your arguments against patents/copyrights. You can respond<br>
through the mail list or at my e-mail address:  jvaquer@primenet.com<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>
