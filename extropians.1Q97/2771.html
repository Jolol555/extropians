&lt;You are making a category error to compare trade with "other things" <br>

the same category.  Trade is a principle of human interaction, not a <br>
value in itself.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes. Both Damien and Nadia's responses seem to assume that trade is <br>
only about material objects and that human emotions are somehow not <br>
subject to the principles of communication and economics that are <br>
nicely summarized by the single word 'trade'.<br>
<p>
Of course, when you make statements like<br>
&lt;No measure of value better than the dollar.&gt;<br>
<p>
which allowed Gregory to ask<br>
&lt;What is the monetary value of your love for your mother?&gt;<br>
<p>
and Damien to post his sarcastic scenario which I won't repeat.<br>
<p>
Of course there are some things we value where it is not practical to <br>
put a _monetary_ value on them, particularly in life-threatening <br>
situations.  But this does not mean that the principles of trade don't <br>
still apply in most situations where there is time for reasoned <br>
thought rather than immediate reflex reaction.<br>
<p>
Lee added:<br>
&lt;Most societies  in the present era have moved from hunter-gatherer to <br>
slave/exploiter.  Hopefully we can progress further to free traders. <br>
 Perhaps in some long-distant future in a different technological <br>
world, something even better might be possible (say, immortal <br>
non-consuming explorers), but not yet.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes again.  I think people like Gregory (and Jim Legg, who <br>
coincidentally departed just before Gregory appeared) seem to think <br>
that it's already feasible for us to be "immortal non-consuming <br>
explorers", just because that is what most transhumanists and <br>
extropians desire, just because some of us are already living in an <br>
'information age', even though the majority are still stuck in the <br>
agricultural or industrial ages.  I don't believe in sudden <br>
transcendance - no human or AI or SI can suddenly *absorb* all the <br>
knowledge of the ages overnight, even if they miraculously had <br>
*access* to it.  If, as you say, we are not first "free traders", then <br>
we are regressing to a "slave/exploiter" mode.  Both self and societal <br>
transformation have to happen in stages.<br>
<p>
This thread is rearing its head "once again" because it's such an <br>
important principle, so easily misunderstood.  I think the following <br>
notes from my archives might also add some value here:<br>
<p>
&lt;06/23/93. COMPULSORY ETHICS. Letters to the Wall Street Journal <br>
regarding Michael Lerner's 6/3 Counterpoint article "The Meaning of <br>
the Politics of Meaning" are unanimously negative. As John W. Deming, <br>
Jr. of Palo Alto, Calif., writes: "The activist government of Mr. <br>
Lerner's (and Hillary Clinton's) 'politics of meaning' means <br>
increasing state intrusiveness into our lives at the expense of our <br>
own voluntary pursuits of happiness. Such noncoercive pursuits are <br>
what make up the marketplace, a natural human phenomenon that Mr. <br>
Lerner scorns. It's interesting that he considers peaceful commercial <br>
activity as evil while he views state coercion as the font of goodness <br>
and light. In fact, his views and incidentally Mrs. Clinton's also, <br>
betray an appalling ignorance of how markets actually function. The <br>
free market is the world's most vivid example of the Golden Rule. <br>
Since the marketplace arises from noncoercive exchange, the only way <br>
to succeed in a market environment is to create value for others." Dan <br>
Lyons of Wheaton, Ill., adds: "Mr. Lerner refers to our capitalistic <br>
process as 'an economy whose bottom line metality rewards those who <br>
are most effective at manipulating or controlling others ...' In a <br>
truly free market no one controls or manipulates anyone. A deal is <br>
consummated only if all involved parties mutually benefit from the <br>
transaction. The only institution that unduly controls us is the <br>
activist government that Mr. Lerner purports to be associated with."&gt;<br>
