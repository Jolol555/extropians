I agree completely. Cloning per se is not a useful way to enhance one's <br>
own life, except in some applications. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are serious problems raised as well.  Let us suppose that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; becomes relatively common for people to choose to give birth to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; clone of an existing person rather than a new individual with randomly</i><br>
<i>&gt; chosen genetics.  You can get a sure thing rather than a crap shoot.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course the sure thing may lack any of the parents' genes, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience of people who adopt children suggests that this may not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; much of a barrier.  You can have a child who is virtually guaranteed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a genius, or have marvelous atheletic or musical talent, or to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical beauty, simply by cloning an adult with these characteristics.</i><br>
<p>
Beware of genetic determinism! While it is certainly quite possible to <br>
give birth to children that have good preconditions for becoming athletes <br>
or musical, much more than that is required. I seriously doubt Beethoven <br>
would have become the great composer he became if he grew up in a middle <br>
class american family. Some studies implies that geniuses while <br>
intelligent, almost always excelled mainly because of early and through <br>
training (due to good teachers or personality). Giving your cloned child <br>
the right upbringing is even harder than bringing up a child in general, <br>
since you try to nurture traits you believe it has big potential in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or people may choose to clone themselves, Mommy's little girl and Daddy's</i><br>
<i>&gt; little boy.  Everyone who ever secretly wanted a twin sibling can now</i><br>
<i>&gt; get their wish, albeit gratification delayed.  You can raise your clone</i><br>
<i>&gt; just the way you would have wanted to be raised.</i><br>
<p>
I have a friend who would like to try this, placing clones of himself in <br>
a variety of families and creating a group of versions of himself as he <br>
could be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At the same time there are obvious problems with such a society.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; child who grows up as a clone is going to be facing an unusual set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; expectations.  Hopefully his innate talents will be in close accordance</i><br>
<i>&gt; with his pre-programmed career goals, so that the Michael Jordan clones</i><br>
<i>&gt; will take to basketball as soon as they can walk.</i><br>
<p>
This is also a problem with genetic improvements and actively <br>
trying to bring up children into geniuses. It is worth studying how to <br>
deal with it, both in terms of how to help the child and how to deal with <br>
the often unrealistic expectations of the parents.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ownership of genetic code is an interesting problem with a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; similarities to today's debate about intellectual property.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, shouldn't it be possible to copyright one's genome? That means <br>
replication of it without permission is not allowed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should a person be able to control how and when</i><br>
<i>&gt; new clones of himself are made?  If so, how about second-generation copies?</i><br>
<p>
Sound reasonable. But once the clone is accepted as a person, he can <br>
justly claim the ownership of his own genome and making any clones of <br>
himself is his decision, not the original clone (hmm, I have to watch <br>
Multiplicity, I think). <br>
