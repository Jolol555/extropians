dasher@netcom.com (Anton Sherwood):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;With the reissue of _The Probability Broach_, everyone has had a new </i><br>
opportunity to say how wonderful it is.  I found it deeply flawed. <br>
Here are the gripes that I remember after ~13 years:<br>
     <br>
- All female characters are Heinlein heroines.<br>
- The goodguys survive because the badguys never use their guns.<br>
- Unable to stop the badguys' evil plan preemptively (because that<br>
        would be coercive), our heroes blow them up accidentally. <br>
        This is described as a triumph of free will.<br>
- As is Bear's double existence, as if gametes were chosen consciously. <br>
- Griswold's chilling reputation is presented but never justified.<br>
- I can accept a talking gorilla.  I can accept a gorilla with an English<br>
        surname.  But a gorilla with an English *hyphenated* surname? <br>
        (And does the wrist-gadget pronounce it Fanshaw?)<br>
     <br>
Am I alone in my opinion?  Did I misread or misremember? <br>
Are some of the flaws corrected in the new edition?<br>
     &lt;<br>
     <br>
        I just re-read it an enjoyed it.  I don't agree with all of <br>
        your criticisms... BUT...A few things I found bothersome:  the <br>
        New-Agey concept of intelligent apes and dolphins, under the <br>
        supposed premise that even in *our* world these animals are <br>
        really intelligent if we only knew how to communicate with <br>
        them.<br>
        <br>
        The idea that it was impermissible to take a preemptive strike <br>
        against the Hamiltonians' plan to conquer and possibly nuke <br>
        the Confederacy.<br>
        <br>
        The idea that the bad-earth people would be farther ahead in <br>
        nuclear weapons technology than the good-earth guys, who are <br>
        so much richer, more advanced technologically--and also big <br>
        weapons fanatics.<br>
        <br>
        If I recall right, the good guys helped install a broach, with <br>
        the help of Vaughn Meiss (get it, von Mises...) on the bad <br>
        earth.  But later on an accident occurred when Win Bear went <br>
        through the broach--some guy got caught in it and it caused a <br>
        big explosion on the other side (the bad earth side).  They <br>
        admitted that if more of the guy's mass had been on the other <br>
        side of the broach, the entire city or country could have been <br>
        blown up.  Where is the responsibility here?  Is this itself <br>
        not an act of aggression against all the bad-earth Americans <br>
        who were almost killed due to a scientific experiment of the <br>
        good guys?<br>
        <br>
        The implausibility of the history:  even if Jefferson had been <br>
        able to abolish slavery, it is my understanding that he wanted <br>
        to ship the blacks to Africa to avoid racial conflict etc., <br>
        since he thought the blacks inferior and that they would never <br>
        be able to live in harmony with whites.  Apparently, after <br>
        Jefferson freed the slaves, they were allowed to stay.  But <br>
        this is admittedly a pretty minor matter.<br>
        <br>
        I also thought Smith's list of presidents interesting--Rand, <br>
        Spooner, Hospers, etc., but very unrealistic, since most of <br>
        these people were thinkers but not necessarily political <br>
        leaders.<br>
