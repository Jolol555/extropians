<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Decades/centuries?  Peter Russel in his fairly recent book</i><br>
<p>
Yes. I first typed 'decades', wrote on, thought, then came back and added <br>
'centuries'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 'The Global Brain Awakens' makes a fairly strong case that we</i><br>

<i>&gt; exponential growth curves are involved.  I tend to agree with</i><br>
<p>
I know that. It's just that I don't believe that an exponential (or <br>
hypergolic hyperbolic) curve describes future developments adequately. <br>
(I wish it did, since liquid nitrogen is _very_ cold, and my belly <br>
(emotion) does not buy everything my head (ratio) tells it about <br>
identity conservation). The whisky is good, but the steak is substandard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; him.  Decades I would agree with (if the number of them were low)</i><br>
<i>&gt; but, IMO, not centuries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is also the possibility that technological development may</i><br>
<i>&gt; end up being hyper-exponential (with time) when "qualitative" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "non-continuous" breakthroughs (e.g. as in that often mentioned</i><br>
<p>
Oh yes, Singularity is a nice concept. Saturation sounds much less <br>
interesting. And developmental discontinuities (plateaus), caused<br>
to JIT-unavailabilty of next-generation technologies sound outright <br>
grim. So I'm a killjoy. Sue me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "hardware vaporware" that will suddenly boost computer/communication</i><br>
<p>
"Vaporware"? One might be tempted to take it verbatim. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; speeds by factors of thousands that I keep hearing is right around</i><br>
<i>&gt; the corner) not to mention unexpected cross-fertilizations between</i><br>
<i>&gt; different disciplines.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, there's a lot of things happening. However, I think that <br>
superintelligent machines are the key, and these will need truly <br>
impressive hardware, which will need oodles of cash and manpower for R&amp;D, <br>
which industry might be unwilling (local optimization), and the state <br>
unable to spend and a couple decades to hatch (wet neurosci results, <br>
molecular manufacturing, macroscopic von Neumann probes, etc.) which is <br>
simply is not happening.<br>
 <br>
Maybe we need better PR.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe it won't in fact be hyper-exponential, but I feel that your</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion still falls under what I would call the default way</i><br>
<i>&gt; of estimating the future that Russel describes as flawed.  What</i><br>
<i>&gt; do you think, do I have the beginnings of a compelling case?</i><br>
<p>
Eliezer makes a very good point, one which maestro Vinge described <br>
in the blooming of the Blight at the beginning of AFUTD: each subsequent <br>
second grew longer and longer. Arithmetically, the argument is <br>
impeccable: a fast machine can be used to build a yet faster machine, <br>
which in turn... However, remember the reasons why Lem's 'GODs' in <br>
"Fiasco" were so tiny. Wormhole building is accessible (if at all) at <br>
very high energies, which take vast structures, which take some time to <br>
build. There might be even a natural barrier (killjoy, killjoy), the <br>
grapes might be hanging a trifle too high for natural life (spake Michio <br>
Kaku in "Hyperspace").<br>
<p>
So relativistic physics sets us a barrier. Building megascale physical <br>
structures a yet another. Moreover, the future is in flux. We can't be <br>
certain of anything. We all might be dead or thrown back noticeably by <br>
2030, because of a natural, or, engineered pandemia, a society breakdown, <br>
a global war for resources, whatever (Boulding's War Trap, Population <br>
Trap, Entropy Trap in the "Great Transition" (1964)). The only certain <br>
thing about the future is that it is uncertain. Trivially? True.<br>
