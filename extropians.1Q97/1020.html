Yes. Now you slavishly serve your memes, such as your superstitious<br>
rigid belief in a clearcut and well-understood distinction between<br>
"reason" and "emotion". You haven't got the foggiest idea what the<br>
referents of those words are: no one does, as of yet. You could<br>
just as easily be dogmatically ranting about phlogiston or the<br>
luminiferous ether.<br>
<p>
The funniest thing is that in your foolish ranting against the<br>
passions, you don't even notice that you are entirely caught up in<br>
your emotional passion for rationality. You just blindly whirl<br>
about in your libertarian macho-flash routine, giving the beliefs<br>
that you happen to share with me a bad name in your community (which<br>
pisses me off, incidentally), prating about "free will" while<br>
functioning as a marionette for Ayn Rand's mind.<br>
<p>
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I rude? I'm just calling it like I see it here.<br>
I certainly hope you won't be so irrational as to allow any of your<br>
buttons to be pushed by this post. Perhaps when you respond, you'll<br>
show some evidence of actually having read it, rather than simply<br>
seizing another opportunity to grind your ax at us.<br>
