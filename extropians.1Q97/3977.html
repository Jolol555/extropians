<i>&gt; This is an excellent point.  The more I think about it, the more I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; forced to agree with the great mind of Eli Yudkowski: evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychology is the best field of study to answer those questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; People, and the societies they form, are the way they are because we</i><br>

Exactly. I had seen on  somebody's page somewhere, along with a FAQ, a<br>
FAD, or Frequently Asked Doubts (I beleive it was on either the Black<br>
Horse Rocket Plane page, or Gary Hudson's ROTON page) which dealt with<br>
people's statements of disbeleive or opposition. THis might be something<br>
to add to the extropians site....<br>
