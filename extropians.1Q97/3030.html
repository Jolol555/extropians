<i>&gt; "perfectly preserved 400,000 year old wooden spears"!</i><br>
<p>
  There's no reason for the exclamation point except perhaps to remark<br>
on the fact that circumstances conspired to preserve artifacts made<br>
from organic substance for that long.  Stone tools which most people<br>
would say are of comparable complexity to simple wooden spears, if not<br>
more complex, are known from something like two million years before<br>
the present; also dating from a million years ago, or longer, is<br>
indirect evidence of the use of leather containers (polishing of stone<br>
artifacts, or maybe it was bone), and evidence of possible systematic<br>
use of fire (not to say its creation).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just what *did* happen to humans in the last 50,000 years?  </i><br>
<p>
  A fine question; possibly the time should be a little more remote,<br>
but that's a detail.  Biologically, nobody knows, and there is much<br>
controversy.  Culturally, by degrees, fancier technology, and evidence<br>
of larger-scale and more sophisticated cooperation.<br>
