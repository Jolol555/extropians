My idea had been that there's always someone who likes organizing these<br>
things, so they can race ahead to the Far Edge and start organizing.<br>
Build a Dyson radio[1] to get everyone's attention, and possibly shunt<br>
some stars around[2] to make a weird place to be.  I figured you'd leave<br>
a megayear so that everyone else can mosey over.  Possibly more time if<br>
the organizers are doing something fancy.  One idea I'd had was a<br>
Kemplerer rosette of stars, each with a habitable planet, each with a<br>
new intelligent species on it.  This would be a party for the Powers who<br>
really feel godlike and superior.<br>
<p>
Or I suppose there'd be one -- or more? -- Meepoints near the center,<br>
and various parties cropping up elsewhere.  I'd like to be the first to<br>
suggest spamming of the 21cm band as a future problem.<br>

[1] A Dyson sphere powering a radio, of course.  Robin claimed (in a<br>
different conversation) that this could be intergalactically visible,<br>
unless he was talking about a galaxy-powered radio.<br>
<p>
[2] I think gravity-tethered solar sails should work.  Huge sails at the<br>
height where they're supported by radiation, and inflecting most of the<br>
light back around (not at) the star.  Photons go one way, something has<br>
to go the other, and if the sails can be kept stable over the star, both<br>
star and sail should slowly glide off.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
