Greek anarchist Spyros Dapergolas was arrested on 21/6/1995, after an<br>
unsuccessful bank robbery, along with Marios Chrysostomou. Their attempt<br>
was quite amateurish, as he described it himself: he used his own motorbike<br>
and a broken gun. The police decided to get as much as possible out of<br>
this event. They accused Spyros, member of anarchist weekly "Alpha" of yet<br>
another bank robbery which supposedly committed with the help of another<br>
well known anarchist, Kostas Kalaremas. Their only evidence to support this<br>
case was the "confession" of a person Spyros and Kostas hardly knew.<br>
Although this person has long retracted this "confession", the police have<br>
used it in order to keep Spyros in jail beyond the 18 month period, that is<br>
according to greek law the limit after which a prisoner is set free, if he<br>
hasn't yet been brought to court.<br>
Spyros Dapergolas has been on hunger strike since 9/11, demanding his<br>
release. His health condition is critical. He has lost 30 kilos, his sight<br>
has been influenced and he's about to fall into a coma. He was taken to<br>
hospital, but a doctor sent him back to jail, last Thursday, because Spyros<br>
refused to have serum. Despite all these, he is decided to continue his<br>
struggle for freedom until the end, so on Sunday he started a thirst<br>
strike, too. This means that he may die in the next couple of days.<br>
The supreme court will probably rule on the legality of his imprisonment<br>
beyond the 18 month limit, on January 21. If their decision is that his<br>
imprisonment for 23 months is legal, there is also a chance that Spyros be<br>
released because of his health condition.<br>
There has been a number of  anarchists' demonstrations in support of<br>
Spyros, in Athens and Salonica. On Monday there was another one in Athens.<br>
About 500 persons participated in it, promising that "if our comrade dies,<br>
the centre of Athens will be burnt down".<br>

        FREEDOM TO SPYROS DAPERGOLAS NOW<br>

[We believe it will be very helpful if people interested in supporting<br>
Spyros could  send faxes to the ministry of justice of Greece, demanding<br>
Spyros' immediate release from jail. Their fax number is: ++01 775 58 35 ]<br>
