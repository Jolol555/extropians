Eliezer writes, <br>

<i>&gt; The stock market will never be stable until the government gets the heck</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of it.  "Stock market drops 200 points on news of strong economy." </i><br>
<i>&gt; What?  Shouldn't stock prices *rise* if companies are doing better?  No, </i><br>
<i>&gt; because the government, in the name of "stabilizing" (= slowing down)</i><br>
<i>&gt; the economy, raises interest rates that should be set by private bankers, </i><br>
<i>&gt; thus causing bonds to be more attractive than stocks.  </i><br>
<p>
The same thing would happen if rates were set by private bankers.  <br>
<p>
Anyway I was kidding about the stock market going up exponentially.  <br>
This was supposed to be an absurd fantasy to get the new year off to a <br>
humorous start.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "The Incredible Bread Machine" is a fine reference on how the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; boom-and-bust cycle is intrinsic to government, not capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
When you're ready to read books for grown-ups, you will find that <br>
business cycle theory is a large subject, in which simplistic answers <br>
don't get you very far. You might want to read *Differential Equations, <br>
Dynamical Systems, and Linear Algebra* by Hirsch and Smale, <br>
to get an overview of instability and oscillations in dynamical systems.  <br>
Another useful reference is *Perspectives of Nonlinear Dynamics* <br>
by E. Atlee Jackson.  <br>
