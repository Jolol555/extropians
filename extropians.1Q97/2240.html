I'm not convinced that extropian ethics can really lead to results<br>
that are at all compatible with modern-day environmentalism.<br>
<p>
First there is the issue I raised earlier, that the diversity produced<br>
by nature may pale in comparison to what we will have in a few decades.<br>
<p>
I am also unconvinced by the argument that studying nature will shed<br>
light on our competitors and teach us more about our own evolution so<br>
that we can survive better.  The only significant competitors we will<br>
have are other people.  Nobody is going to be threatened by the three<br>
toed sloth.  And improving our own function will probably be best done<br>
by studying our own bodies, and even more by conceiving new and better<br>
augmentations.  We will be able to move so far beyond nature that<br>
information from digging up plants and studying bugs will be of little<br>
relevance to our survival.<br>
<p>
Besides that, there is also an externalities/public-goods problem.<br>
The benefit to me of turning the local vacant lot into a revenue-producing<br>
parking lot will probably be much greater than the negligible loss of<br>
diversity that it causes to the ecosystem as a whole.  That lot is a<br>
tiny fraction of the earth's surface and paving it over won't cause<br>
much loss of diversity, while the profit from developing it is a very<br>
tangible monthly income.<br>
<p>
Millions of decisions like this by people all over the world will lead<br>
to an outcome where the amount of diversity on other people's lands<br>
is less than I would want to see.  My preference is external and not<br>
reflected in their decision to convert their property to productive use.<br>
Biodiversity in this broad sense is a public good.  If one of us lives<br>
in a world with protected rain forests, we all do.  And individualist<br>
economic systems tend to underproduce public goods.<br>
<p>
In a contrarian mood -<br>
<p>
Hal<br>
