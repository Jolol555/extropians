<p>
In humans and the higher mammals the superior colliculus is a<br>
visual center secondary to the more important striate cortex<br>
(areas 17 and 18 on the Brodmann map) located at the rear of the<br>
cerebral hemispheres, but in lower animals such as the frog and<br>
snake, which lack any significant cortex, the superior colliculus<br>
(or optic tectum, as it is called in them) is their principal<br>
visual center. It is an important center even for mammals, however,<br>
and it works roughly as follows.<br>
<p>
The top-most layer of the superior colliculus (hereafter, SC)<br>
receives projections directly from the retina, and it constitutes<br>
a metrically-deformed topographic map of the retinal surface (figure<br>
7b) [...]. Vertical elements connect this layer to the deepest layer<br>
of the SC. These vertical connections appear to consist of a chain<br>
of two or three short interneurons descending stepwise through two<br>
intervening layers [...], of which more later. Also, the dendrites<br>
of some of the deep-layer neurons appear to ascend directly into<br>
the visual layer, to make synaptic connections with visual cells<br>
[...]. The neurons of the deepest layer project their output axons<br>
via two distinct nervous pathways, one of which leads eventually to<br>
the pair of extra-ocular muscles responsible for horizontal eye<br>
movements [...].<br>
<p>
Intriguingly, this underlying motor layer also embodies a topographic<br>
map, a map of state space that represents changes in the contractile<br>
position of the ocular muscles, the muscles that make the eye jump<br>
[...]. Microstimulation by an electrode at any given point in this<br>
deepest layer causes the eyes to execute a saccade of a size and<br>
direction characterisitic for that point, a saccade which moves<br>
the eye's fovea into the position originally occupied by that retinal<br>
cells which projects to the immediately overlying cell in the<br>
top-most layer of the colliculus [...]. In other words, the relative<br>
metrical deformations in the two maps have placed into correspondence<br>
the appropriate points in the upper and lower maps. (This means<br>
that the "deformation" seen in figure 7b should not of itself<br>
be taken as evidence for the state-space sandwich hypothesis. What<br>
is crucial is the deformation of the maps relative to each other.)<br>
<p>
Finally, any sufficiently strong retinally produced stimulation<br>
in that top-most visual map is conveyed downwards to the motor map<br>
by the appropriate vertical elements, where it produces a saccade<br>
of just the size and direction appropriate for the foveation of the<br>
external stimulus that provoked it. The SC thus appears to be an<br>
instance of both the structural and the functional pattern displayed<br>
in figure 6. It foveates on changing or moving visual targets by<br>
essentially the same means whereby the schematic cortex of the crab<br>
reaches out for triangulated objects.<br>
<p>
A word of caution is in order here, since the account just offered<br>
does not do justice to the full complexity of the superior<br>
colliculus. In mammals, especially the higher mammals, the SC is<br>
a tightly integrated part of a larger modulating system that<br>
includes inputs from the visual cortex and the frontal eye fields,<br>
and output to the neck muscles. The functional properties of the<br>
entire system are more varied and more subtle than the preceding<br>
suggests, and the job of sorting them out is still underway [...].<br>
The preceding is submitted as an account of the central or more<br>
primitive functions of the SC, at best.<br>
<p>
With these examples in mind -- the crab's "cortex," and the<br>
superior colliculus -- it is appropriate to focus on the many<br>
other topographically-organized multilayered cortical areas<br>
scattered throughout the brain, and ask what coordinate<br>
transformation they might be effecting. Here it is very important<br>
to appreciate that the topographic maps we seek to decode need<br>
not be, and generally will not be, maps of something anatomically<br>
obvious, such as the surface of the retina, or the surface of<br>
the skin. More often they will be maps of some abstract state<br>
space, whose dimensional significance is likely to be opaque<br>
to the casual observer, though of great functional importance to<br>
the brain. Two pretty examples of such abstract maps are the<br>
map of the echo delays in the bat's auditory cortex, and the<br>
map of binaural disparities in the owl's inferior colliculus<br>
[...].<br>
<p>
All of this suggests that the brain may boast many more topographic<br>
maps that have so far been identified, or even suspected.<br>
Certainly the brain has a teeming abundance of topographically<br>
organized areas, and recent work has expanded the number of<br>
known sensory-related maps considerably [...]. All of this further<br>
suggests that we will make better progress in trying to understand<br>
the significance of the many topographically-organized cortical<br>
areas when we approach them as maps of abstract but functionally<br>
relevant state spaces.<br>
<p>
5 Cortex with more than two layers<br>
<p>
While we are discussing the biological reality of the laminar<br>
mechanism proposed, consider the objection that our modl cortex<br>
has only two layers, whereas the typical human cortex has six<br>
layers, and, counting fine subdivisions, perhaps eight or nine<br>
in some areas. What are they for?<br>
<p>
There is no difficulty in perceiving a function for such additional<br>
layers. Let us return to again to the superior colliculus, which<br>
illustrates one of many possibilities here. Between the visual and<br>
the motor maps of the SC there are, in some creatures, onee or<br>
two intermediate layers (see again figure 7). These appear to<br>
constitute an auditory map and/or a somatosensory map (a facial or<br>
whisker map), whose function is again to orient the eye's fovea,<br>
this time toward the source of sudden auditory and/or somatosensory<br>
stimulation [...]. Not surprisingly, these intervening maps are<br>
each metrically deformed in such a fashion as to be in rough<br>
coordinate "register" with the motor map, and hence with each other.<br>
Altogether, this elegant three- or four-layer topographic sandwich<br>
constitutes a multimodal sensorimotor coordinate transformer.<br>
<p>
Multilayered structures have further virtues. It is plain that<br>
maps of several distinct modalities, suitably deformed and placed<br>
in collective register within a "club sandwich," provide a most<br>
effective means of cross-modal integration and comparison. In the<br>
SC, for example, this multimodal arrangement is appropriate in the<br>
production of a motor response to the joint receipt of faint but<br>
spatiotemporally coincident auditory and visual stimuli, stimuli<br>
which, in isolation, would have been subthreshold for a motor<br>
response. For example, a faint sound from a certain compass point<br>
may be too faint to prompt the eyes into a foveating saccade, and<br>
a tiny movement from a certain compass point may be similiarly<br>
impotent; but if both the sound and movement come from the same<br>
compass point (and are thus coded in the SC along the same vertical<br>
axis), then their simultaneouos conjunction will indeed be sufficient<br>
to make the motor layer direct the eyes appropriately. This<br>
prediction is strongly corroborated by the recent results of Meredith<br>
and Stein (1095).<br>
<p>
Further exploration reveals that multilayered sandwiches can subserve<br>
decidedly sophisticated cognitive functions. In an earlier publication<br>
[...], I have shown how a three-layer state-space sandwich can code,<br>
and project, the path of a _moving_ object in such a fashion as to<br>
position the crab's arm to catch the moving target on the fly.<br>
Evidently, a multilayered cortex can offer considerable advantages.<br>
<p>
6 Beyond state-space sandwiches<br>
<p>
The examples studied above are uniform in having an input state<br>
space of only two dimensions, and an output state space of only<br>
two dimensions. It is because of this fact that the required<br>
coordinate transformation can be achieved by a contiguous pair<br>
of sheet like maps. But what of cases where the subsystems involved<br>
each have more than two parameters? What of cases where the<br>
coordinate transformations are from an input spac of n to an<br>
output space of m dimensions, where n and m are different, and<br>
both greater than 2? Consider, for example, the problem of<br>
coordinating the joint angles of a limb with three or more<br>
joints, and the problem of coordinating several such limbs with<br>
each other. Or consider the problem of coordinating the even<br>
larger number of muscles that collectively control such limbs.<br>
As soon as one examines the problems routinely faced, and solved,<br>
by real creatures, one appreciates that many of them are far<br>
more complex than can be represented by simple two-dimensions<br>
to two-dimensions transformation.<br>
<p>
Perhaps some of these more complex problems might be solved<br>
by dividing them into a set of smaller ones, problems that<br>
can be managed after all by a set of distinct two-dimensional<br>
state-space sandwiches, each addressing some slice or<br>
aspect of the larger problem [...]. The predominance of<br>
laminar cortex in the brain certainly encourages speculation<br>
along these lines. But such solutions, even approximate ones,<br>
cannot in general be guaranteed. The brain badly needs some<br>
mechanism beyond the state-space sandwich if it is routinely<br>
to handle these higher dimensional problems.<br>
<p>
Andras Pellionisz and Rodolfo Llinas [...] have already<br>
outlined a mechanism adequate to the task, and have found<br>
impressive evidence of its implementation within the<br>
cerebellum. The cerebellum is the large structure at the<br>
rear of the brain, just underneath the cerebral hemispheres.<br>
Its principal function, divined initially from lesion studies,<br>
is the coordination of complex bodily movements, such as<br>
would be displayed in in preparing a dinner or in playing<br>
basketball. It displays a neural organization quite different<br>
from that of the cerebral hemispheres, an organization whose<br>
significance may be rendered transparent by the Pellionicz/<br>
Llinas account.<br>
<p>
To illustrate this more general mechanism for coordinate<br>
transformation, let us consider an input system of four dimensions<br>
whose inputs a, b, c, d, are transformed into the values x, y, z<br>
of a three-dimensional output system. As before, the outputs<br>
and inputs are can each be regarded as points in a suitable<br>
state space. Since they are n-tuples, each can also be regarded<br>
as a vector (whose base lies at the origin of the relevant<br>
state space, and whose arrowhead lies at the point specified<br>
by the n-tuple).<br>

<p>
A standard mathematical operation for the systematic transformation<br>
of vectors into vectors is matrix multiplication. Here it is the<br>
matrix that embodies or effects the desired coordinate transformation.<br>
To see how this works, consider the matrix of figur 8, which has four<br>
rows and three columns. To multiply the input vector &lt;a,b,c,d&gt; by this<br>
matrix we multiply a times p_1, b times p_2, c times p_3, d times p_4,<br>
and then sum the four results to yield x. We then repeat the process<br>
with the second column to yield y, and again with the third column to<br>
yield z. Thus results the output vectors &lt;x,y,z&gt;. [of course matrixmult<br>
is but a narrow example of a generic mapping, which can be written as<br>
a table -- 'gene ]<br>
<p>
This algebraic operation can be physically realized quite simply by<br>
the neural array of figure 9. The parallel input fibres at the right<br>
each send a train of electrochemical "spikes" towards the waiting<br>
dendritic trees. The numbers a, b, c, d represent the amount by which<br>
the momentary spiking frequency of each of the four fibres is above<br>
<p>
[ Figure 10 Schematic section: cerebellum is omitted due to ascii art<br>
  limitations. You see lots of treelike Purkinje cells (sprouting<br>
  synapses on tree branches) reaching into a thick slab of parallel<br>
  fibres. Some granular cells (below the Purkinjes) generate some<br>
  of the input of the parallel fibres. (Well, a picture _is_ worth<br>
  a 1 kWord ]<br>
<p>
(positive number) or below (negative number) a certain baseline<br>
spiking frequency. The top-most input fibre, for example, synapses<br>
into each of the three output cells, making a stimulating connection<br>
in each case, one that tends to depolarize the cell body and make<br>
it send a spike down its vertical output axon. The output frequency<br>
of spike emissions for each cell is determined first by the simple<br>
_frequency_ of the input stimulations it receives from all incoming<br>
synaptic connections, and second, by the _weight_ or strength of<br>
each synaptic connection, which is determined by the placement of<br>
the synapses and by their cross-sectional areas. These strength<br>
values are individually represented by the coefficients of the<br>
matrix of figure 8. The neural interconnectivity thus implements<br>
the matrix. Each of the three cells of figure 9 "sums" the<br>
stimulation it receives, and emits an appropriate train of spikes<br>
down its output axon. Those three output frequences differ from<br>
the background or baseline frequencies of the three output cells<br>
by positive or negative amounts, and these amounts correspond to<br>
the output vector &lt;x,y,z&gt;.<br>
<p>
Note that with state-space sandwiches, the coding of information<br>
is a matter of the spatial location of neural events. By contrast,<br>
with the matrix-multiplication style of computation under<br>
discussion, input and output variables are coded by sets of spiking<br>
frequencies in the relevant pathways. The former system uses<br>
"spatial coding"; the latter system used "frequency coding." But<br>
both systems are engaged in the coordinate transformation of<br>
state-space positions.<br>
<p>
The example of figure 9 concerns a tree-by-four matrix. But it is<br>
evident that neither the mathematical operation nor its physical<br>
realization suffers any dimensional limitations. In principle,<br>
a Pellionisz/Llinas connectivity matrix can effect transformations<br>
on state spaces of a dimensionality into thousands and beyond.<br>
<p>
The schematic archetecture of figure 9 corresponds very closely<br>
to the style of microorganization found in the cerebellum<br>
(figure 10). [...]. The horizontal fibres are called parallel fibres,<br>
and they input from the higher motor centres. The bushy vertical<br>
cells are called Purkinje cells, and they output through the<br>
cerebellar nucleus to the motor periphery. In fact, it was from<br>
the observation of the cerebellum's beautifully regular architecture,<br>
and from the attempt to recreate its functional properties by<br>
modelling its large-scale physical connectivity within a computer,<br>
that Pellionisz and Llinas were originally led to the view that<br>
the cerebellum's job is the systematic transformation of vectors<br>
in one neural hyperspace into vectors in another neural hyperspace<br>
[...].<br>
<p>
Given that view of the problem, the tensor calculus emerges as<br>
the natural framework with which to address such matters, especially<br>
since we cannot expect the brain to limit itself to Cartesian<br>
coordinates. In the examples discussed so far, variation in<br>
position along any axis of the relevant state space is independent<br>
of variation along any of the other axes, but this independence<br>
will not characterize state spaces with nonorthogonal axes. Indeed,<br>
the generalization of the approach, to include non-Cartesian<br>
hyperspaces, is regarded by Pellionicz and Llinas as one of the<br>
most important features of their account, a feature that is<br>
essential to understanding all but the simplest coordination<br>
problem. I cannot pursue this feature here.<br>
<p>
Four final points about the neural matrix of figure 9. First, it<br>
need not be limited to computing linear transformations. The<br>
individual synaptic connections might represent any of a broad<br>
range of functional properties. They do not need be simple<br>
multipliers. In concert then, they are capable of computing<br>
a large variety of non-linear transformations. Second, a neural<br>
matrix will have the same extraordinarily speed displayed by<br>
a state-space sandwich. And third, given a great many components,<br>
such matrices will also display a fierce functional persistence<br>
despite the scattered loss of their cellular components.<br>
<p>
Finaally, such systems can be plastic in the transformations they<br>
effect: changes in the weights and/or numbers of the synaptic<br>
connections are all that is required. What is problematic is how<br>
a useful set of weights, i.e. a set that effects a transformation<br>
useful to the organism, gets established in the first place. How<br>
does the matrix 'learn' ot implement the right transformation?<br>
<p>
The problem is certainly solvable in principle. The 'back-<br>
propagation' learning algorithm of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams<br>
(1986) has shown that distributed processors of this general<br>
type can learn with extraordinary efficiency, given a suitable<br>
regime for propagating discovered error back through the<br>
elements of the system. And it may be solvable in fact, since<br>
the cerebellar network does contain a second input system: the<br>
climbing fibres (not shown in figures 9 and 10 for reasons of<br>
clarity). These ascend from below each of the Purkinje cell<br>
and wrap themselves like vines around the branches of its<br>
dendritic tree. They are thus in a position to have a direct<br>
effect on the nature of the synapses made by the parallel<br>
fibres onto the Purkinje dendrites. According to a recent model<br>
by Pellionicz and Llinas (1985), the cerebellum can indeed<br>
become 'coordinated' by essentially this method.<br>
<p>
These brief remarks do not do justice to the very extensive work<br>
of Pellionicz and Llinas, nor have I explored any criticism.<br>
[...]. The reader must turn to the literature for deeper<br>
instruction. The principal lesson of this section is that the<br>
general functional schema being advanced here -- the schema<br>
of representation by state-space position, and computation<br>
by coordinate transformation -- does not encounter<br>
implementational difficulties when te representational and<br>
computational task exceeds the case of two dimensions. On the<br>
contrary, the brain boasts neural machinery that is ideally<br>
suited to cases of very high dimensionality. We have then<br>
at least two known brain mechanisms for performing coordinate<br>
transformations: the state-space sandwich specifically for the<br>
two-dimensional cases, and the neural matrix for cases of<br>
any dimensionality whatsoever.<br>
