I've been wondering: what is the absolute minimum state that could<br>
stabilize something like David Friedman's competing private laws?<br>
<p>
I assume that you'd need a large scale "state" to manage national<br>
defense.  There would be serious free rider problems otherwise, and<br>
there seem to be strong economies of scale to military coordination.<br>
<p>
Given that this central defense system exists, I imagine<br>
that it could be available to enforce contracts between competing<br>
private laws.  That is, two laws could pay this central system to<br>
adjudicate the contract between them, "sending in the army" to<br>
punish/disband a violator.   <br>
<p>
My first question is: is this enough to preserve local legal diversity?<br>
Imagine some law held 40% of local customers, with the next highest<br>
law holding 20% of customers.  And imagine that this law is going to<br>
try to get 95%+ local market share.  This biggest law would seem to<br>
have a lower monitoring/patroling cost.  For the same number of patrol<br>
cars it gets to swing by twice as many customers.  So it might try to<br>
lower prices to drive out competition.  <br>
<p>
More severely, it might notice when no other law was patrolling the<br>
customer of a competing law, and make some "accidents" happen to those<br>
other customers.  The competing law might know it would cost it more<br>
to compensate this with more monitoring, or retaliatory accidents, and<br>
so be persuaded to leave the area.  Is there a contract laws could<br>
write with each other ahead of time to assure customers that this<br>
scenario would be very unlikely?  <br>
