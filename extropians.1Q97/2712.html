San Jose Mercury? I don't know much about it, but I've seen reliable<br>
stories from it before. I also saw an AP article a couple of years ago<br>
about a DEA seizure of a ton of cocaine which was bounced by the CIA<br>
because they were importing it for some drug gang that they wanted help<br>
from. I probably still have the details on a CD-ROM somewhere, but not<br>
handy; I particularly remember it because it was the first time I'd seen<br>
such a story from such a (relatively) reliable source. There might be a <br>
copy somewhere on the Web.<br>

Leary did pretty well when he was treating criminals with LSD, but I don't<br>
think they were particularly violent. AFAIR many of them did end up back<br>
in prison eventually, but mostly for parole violations rather than new<br>
crimes. I think the full details are somewhere in the hyperreal archives. <br>
