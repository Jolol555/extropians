I think the problem with your argument is that even though we define the<br>
universe as everything, I find theists generally consider god to somehow<br>
be "outside" of the universe.  I don't think you're going to change their<br>
opinion on this.<br>
<p>
However, one argument I see theists constantly using is that of teleology.<br>
They will point out that if anything is complex, it must be made by<br>
someone.  If we see something complex like an airplane, it must be made<br>
by an intelligent creator( in this case, human beings)   Then the theist<br>
will ramble on about how amazingly complex the human body is, how if the<br>
human genome was in book form, it would fill the grand canyon multiple<br>
times, etc., etc.  Anyway, if you are making a precise map of the<br>
mandelbrot set, it will overflow an infinite number of universes, so the<br>
human complexity thing is a bit of a silly argument meant to awe people<br>
into a faith in a higher power.<br>
<p>
	Anyway, if a theist ever tells you that the universe is too<br>
complex to have just "popped" into existence, you've got them nailed.  The<br>
problem with saying that complexity must have a creator is that it has no<br>
end.  If the a deity created the universe, then logically this deity is<br>
more complicated than the universe.  For this deity to be THAT<br>
complex(according to theist logic), it MUST have a creator.  So there has<br>
to be a God version 2 basically that created version 1.  And it goes on,<br>
and on, and on.  To what end?  Wouldn't it be simpler to just to let the<br>
universe stand on its own, or to have multiple universes popping into<br>
existence like virtual particles?<br>
<p>
	I disagree with Johnny Carwash's statement that some are too pious<br>
to be swayed from their faith in god, or that faith and science can<br>
coexist(although I think he actually said faith and nanotechnology)  I do<br>
not see how faith and Pancritical Rationalism can exist together, and PCR<br>
is really what is necessary for a workable scientific method.  An<br>
unshakeable faith in god means that you could just as easily have an<br>
unshakable faith in lamarkism.  Of course, thinking that god probably<br>
exists, and that god irrefutably exists are two entirely separate things,<br>
as separate as science and faith.<br>
<p>
The dynamic optimisit in me tells me that no mind is closed, since all<br>
minds are in constant flux, and where that flux will lead is too chaotic<br>
to predict.  Even the strongest belief can be a temporary thing.<br>
