you will be able to design these dream worlds which you<br>
<i> &gt; will someday live in as an uploaded being. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;This would be transhumanist art would it not?</i><br>
 <br>
 You bet. I dunno about you guys, but I'm already planning the environments<br>
 I'll be living in in both VR, possibly AR, and definately UR (uploaded<br>
 reality).<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
IMAGINATION <br>
     If one of you could commission an art peice, from a revered artist,<br>
PRICE NO limit, excellence of quality no limit, and in any media you wanted<br>
(Either just a glorious exhaltation of transhumanism, or something later to<br>
be used as a sketch perhaps for your uploaded artificial reality) - what kind<br>
of art would it be?<br>
<p>
What would you hang on you wall to proudly show what this is all about....<br>
