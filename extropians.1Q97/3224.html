Robin Hanson wrote about an article in the latest Science that <br>
suspects that the tendency to have fewer children when one is wealthy <br>
is genetic.<br>
<p>
Now, I haven't read this article, and maybe I'm misinterpreting the <br>
theory, but, how is wealth something that could activate genetic <br>
parameters?  It seems to me that the simplest behavioral explanation <br>
would be that the bulk of wealthy people (those who have earned their <br>
wealth without an inherited legacy) tend to realize what it will cost <br>
(mostly in terms of educational expenditures (*)) to keep their <br>
children wealthy; therefore, their child-bearing strategies tend to <br>
emphasize quality over quanity.  How could rational decisions like <br>
this be genetic?<br>
<p>

(*) This might be especially true of wealthy families in countries <br>
that are generally considered poor and offering few opportunities for <br>
the next generation.  I'm sure most wealthy Africans have their <br>
children educated in Europe or the U.S.  It's a hell of alot cheaper <br>
to put one or two kids in boarding school and fly them home once or <br>
twice a year than it is do the same for a larger brood.<br>
