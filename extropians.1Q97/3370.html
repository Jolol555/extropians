It might be interesting to look at some quantitative data to see how well<br>
it matches the cycles predicted in TFT.  I was thinking of public opinion<br>
polls where people are asked questions like whether they believe in God,<br>
or whether they generally feel optimistic about the nation's prospects.<br>
You could graph the percent who answer yes and see if it has a cyclic<br>
structure which is consistent with the predictions.<br>
<p>
Are there any such surveys which go back far enough?  I believe (thanks<br>
to Robin's correction) that we are supposed to be replaying the WWI<br>
through 1920's era now.  So if we had data which went back to 1900 it<br>
would provide at least some overlap between cycles.<br>
