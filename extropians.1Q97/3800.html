<i>&gt; Go back to civics 101.  The constitution authorized congress to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create such laws.  It did not in fact do so until many years later</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the creation of the USPTO.  Until then, there were thriving</i><br>
<i>&gt; publishing and manufacturing industries without the subsidies of</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyrights and patents.</i><br>
<p>
It would be great if you could offer a model or some evidence/background<br>
to back up these  facts.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The fact that you confuse trademarks and licensing with copyrights and</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents is a symptom of the problem.  Look at the objective realities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the propaganda: If I use your name, I commit fraud.  That's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; trademark.  If I break a contract with you, that's an enforceable tort.</i><br>
<p>
Not.  If you breach a contract you have Contract remedies available to<br>
you, not those from tort law.  Fraud is enforceable in Tort.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I reprint a chapter from a book you wrote--and which you freely</i><br>
<i>&gt; chose to publish on the open market with no disclaimers or licenses</i><br>
<i>&gt; or physical protection of any sort--and not claiming that it's mine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have not committed fraud, I have breached no contract that I signed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have merely used information that I got through non-coercive means</i><br>
<i>&gt; for my own benefit, and the government will come in--at my expense</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as yours--and prosecute me for it.  That's a copyright (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; similarly for patents).</i><br>
<p>
Good point, but you still havn't expressed how IP would be protected<br>
otherwise.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Your argument is irrational and typical of the hacker ethic that whats</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mine is mine and whatever I can crack, pry up, steal, or defraud from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people is mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tie that slander to reality.  I make no claim to anything that is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine and never have.  In fact, I have made my honest living for 15 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a computer programmer and writer--a producer of intellectual property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I respect that my employers believe in those laws, but I still refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; to participate in my own name, because I can see beyond the justifications</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the propaganda.  I don't want to steal or defraud--I simply refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be an accessory to the government's denying people the right to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; what I have freely given them.  If I want to keep my inventions, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect them myself, and pay for the technologies and contracts to do it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I cannot in good conscience demand the government get out of my life in</i><br>
<i>&gt; one respect, and then come to my benefit in another.  it is dishonest,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and hypocritical, and I will have none of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I choose not to violate the copyrights or patents of others, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have chosen to release works into a system that makes those</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumptions.  But that doesn't mean I won't speak out for a free-market</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-coercive means of doing business in information, just as I speak</i><br>
<i>&gt; out for free-market means of doing everything else big brother want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; When the state derives its authority from that granted by its citizens,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as ours is by the constitution, then it is not begging, it is a mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; aid compact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah, yeah, the social contract, blah, blah.  Funny how libertarians</i><br>
<i>&gt; reject such arguments for protecting real property, but are willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow it for IP.  It's inconsistent.   If you want to open a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; bookstores where everyone who buys agrees to respect authors' monopoly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and you don't sell to anyone who doesn't agree, then I'll be happy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.  That might well encourage authors to publish works only in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; set of stores, giving them a market advantage.  I'd be all for it.</i><br>
<p>
What?  You're way off buddy.  Real property is protected in an identical<br>
fashion.  Deeds are your claim to a piece of real property - granted by<br>
the government.  Patents/copyrights are your claim/title to a piece of<br>
IP.  Where's the distinction?<br>
