<i>&gt;text changes when your eyes are in motion we still 'see' the same text on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the screen until we examine it closely and suddenly realise that it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;changed. I found this a real shock the first time, but it's happened to me </i><br>
<i>&gt;so often now that I just find it annoying. </i><br>

<p>
I think you are a bit influenced by the old empiricist philosophical<br>
tradition stemming from Locke Berkely and Hume, which held that we<br>
perceive only 'ideas' and 'impressions', as if what we perceived were a<br>
kind of 'surface' only.  This is quite wrong.  What we *have* (or are?)<br>
is 'ideas' or 'impressions' (our experiential gestalts considered in and<br>
of themselves), what we*see* by means of that having, is the physical<br>
world.<br>
<p>
Can we agree to put it this way?  Lets say there are two senses to 'see'<br>
and 'perceive': direct and indirect.  We don't directly perceive the<br>
physical world, in the sense that we would if our experience of the<br>
physical world were nothing but a sample of it; we perceive it indirectly,<br>
by means of a bit of sampling plus lots of interpretation (some of it pre<br>
-conscious, some conscious).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another demonstration comes from the experiences of psychedelic users, who</i><br>
<i>&gt;(AFAIR) report that the objects they see are far more likely to move</i><br>
<i>&gt;around or change into something different than, say, for the perceived</i><br>
<i>&gt;world to split up into squares and zoom around their field of view as we</i><br>
<i>&gt;might expect if we were just seeing a pixel image from the retina. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Changing a pixel-image of a plant-pot into a pixel-image of an elephant</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be hard work, but simply changing the object description in our data</i><br>
<i>&gt;structure from 'plant-pot' to 'elephant' or changing the coordinates in</i><br>
<i>&gt;space is easy. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Curiously enough, I *have* on occasion had *pixellated* hallucinations.<br>
You know like in Doom, when things get up close?  Like that!<br>
