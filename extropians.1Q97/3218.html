I was interested to see the rave review of the TFT.  I'd heard reviews that<br>
made it sound like uselessly loose jargon and hot air.  I'll give it a look.<br>
<p>
In a similar vein, I'm thinking of picking up D. H. Fischer's most recent<br>
work, on price inflation waves.  His 1989 work, ALBION'S SEED, qualifies as a<br>
must-read on early US (and later) history.  Fischer's method:  use hoards of<br>
grad students and massive amounts of research to generate texts rich in<br>
numbers and illustrations.  From this solid base, offer falsifiable, modest,<br>
and plausible predictions.<br>
<p>
Fischer thus steers clear of mere fluff and conjecture, in general.  Can<br>
anyone comment on his work on price inflation?  (I apologize that I haven't<br>
the title at hand.)  I've heard good things about it from informed experts.<br>
<p>
