In a message dated 97-02-23 00:35:24 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;                    <br>
 I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% .  I want to drive you<br>
 out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then<br>
 I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you louse money on each widget<br>
 you sell, the trouble is I do too. I have 99 times as much money as you do,<br>
 but I'm lousing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very<br>
low<br>
 the demand for widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must build<br>
 more factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and faster,<br>
 meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory and wait<br>
 for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.<br>
                                <br>
 <br>

OR YOU COULD JUST MAKE WIDGETS OBSOLETE EVERY FOUR MONTHS AND ENCOURAGE THE<br>
SALE OF NEW FANCIER MORE POWERFUL FASTER WIDGETS <br>
