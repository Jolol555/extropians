<i>&gt;&gt;Note the implication though: Most capitalists have never appreciated</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the value of free markets, or they would have invested here instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;elsewhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your response clarifies that you meant (I think) that investors should </i><br>
<i>&gt;have been investing here in the U.S., rather than overseas, because </i><br>
<i>&gt;that's where they could get the highest returns.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, both U.S. and foreign investors should have preferred to invest<br>
here, had they expected free markets to help U.S. investments so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me, though, that investors like to diversify.  Even if </i><br>
<i>&gt;they know (and it's doubtful that they had the kind of quantified </i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge of comparative investment returns in major world markets </i><br>
<i>&gt;that the study you cited  provided) where to get the best return, they </i><br>
<i>&gt;might not want to put all their eggs in one basket. </i><br>
<p>
I don't think desires to diversification can explain this difference<br>
in returns, absent any increased riskiness of U.S. investments.<br>
Standard finance theories just don't support this.<br>
