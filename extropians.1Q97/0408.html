Such non-argument hardly deserves refutation.  "Psychologizing" is<br>
creating supposed motivations or developmental explanations for why<br>
a person might think or believe a certain way in order to imply that<br>
such thoughts are not the result of cognitive process.  So rather<br>
than offering mere anecdotal counterexamples, I will attempt to<br>
explain why I think they are flawed.<br>
<p>
Evaluations and measurements are important, indeed fundamental, to<br>
cognitive science.  But that does not imply that every measurement<br>
actually reflects what it is intended to reflect.  The score of a<br>
football game is a useful measurement, but it does not represent a<br>
single inherent quality of the team--it is affected by many things:<br>
the physical skill of the players, the competence of the coaches,<br>
the conditions of the field on gameday, the financial acumen of the<br>
owner, the interpersonal relationships of the players, blind luck,<br>
and a dozen others.  It serves a purpose (entertainment, gambling,<br>
business) but it is not nearly so fundamental as something like,<br>
say, 40-yard dash time (which is itself a combination of factors<br>
like muscle fiber mix, nutrition, body aerodynamics, etc.)<br>
<p>
Yes, SATs measure something.  That something is real, whatever it is.<br>
But to assume that (a) something like "inherent cognitive ability"<br>
exists and (b) SAT measures that, is so far detached from reality<br>
that the idea deserves ridicule.  Ms. Aegis's wonderful demonstration<br>
that one can "prepare" for it clearly shows that it does not measure<br>
an inherent ability.  Correlation studies can show what specific<br>
abilities it can and cannot predict (most show that it predicts little<br>
besides success at similar tests).  <br>
<p>
It doesn't even predict what it is intended to predict: college<br>
success.  Students admitted to college on non-academic scholarships<br>
have about the same success rate as those admitted due to SATs. <br>
One anecdote I will indulge in: my own SAT's are on the level of<br>
Eliezer's (though I took them the year he was born!), and I was a<br>
complete failure at college, both initially and 10 and 15 years<br>
later on subsequent attempts.  Just not my environment, I guess,<br>
and I make too much as a computer nerd to devote all my time to it.<br>
