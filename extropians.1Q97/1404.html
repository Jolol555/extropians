I don't think it will, or can, "catch on" worldwide either, nor do<br>
I think that's important for now.  Nor do I find any value in<br>
uniformity, which most of the other artificial languages assume is<br>
the goal.  Diversity is too valuable--I don't want one language<br>
any more than I'd want one government.<br>
<p>
But that's precisely why I like Lojban rather than all the other<br>
proposed ALs: because it is so completely different from any other<br>
human language in its core structure and utter lack--in fact<br>
outright avoidance--of any recognizable human cultural artifacts.<br>
I think learning it as a second language (or as a first one for<br>
children along with a cultural one) cannot help but challenge the<br>
cultural assumptions that all other human languages--including<br>
artificial ones--are burdened with.  Lojban is truly alien; it has<br>
no nouns, verbs, or adjectives; no assumption of speaker or default<br>
quantifiers/time tenses; no genders, familiar forms, or other<br>
silly cultural baggage.<br>
<p>
The fact that its grammar and phonology are unambiguous (though<br>
one can certainly express ambiguous meanings--in a precise way) is<br>
just icing on the cake, especially for computer/human interaction.<br>
Not only by voice but for things like searching hypertexts where<br>
Lojban words are never declined, and their function in utterances<br>
is always parseable.<br>
<p>
As for "spontaneous order", I think the current state of the<br>
language embodies that quite nicely.  The original genius behind<br>
the creation of Loglan tried to maintain such complete control of<br>
it that most of his students split off a group and redid all his<br>
work with a new vocabulary and some new ideas, and specifically<br>
released all proprietary claims to it, even paying to defend in<br>
court their right to give it away.  Lojban is now completely free<br>
and open to individual change and evolution, with no central<br>
authority of any kind to get in the way.<br>
