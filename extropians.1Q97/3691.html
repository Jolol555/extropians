<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
To clarify the directive of Extropic Art.  (It was unnecessary, actually.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, although the FAQs are very well-written and informative in describing</i><br>
<i>&gt;Transhumanist and Extropian Art, they don't address themselves to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific issue raised by my posts.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is true, not specifically.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They could be used to allow a</i><br>
<i>&gt;consideration of some of my general points in the more specific area of</i><br>
<i>&gt;these forms of art, but they don't directly confirm or deny my statements.</i><br>
<p>
There is no "central" authority.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Now, with the above information as the starting point for creative work,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;there is a continuous balance, just as there is in life and with every</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;decision that we make, whether *art* or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My point being that observers may not have any of that information, and are</i><br>
<i>&gt;therefore free to create their own interpretations which may be entirely at</i><br>
<i>&gt;odds with that of the artist. This is no big news, nor a criticism of art,</i><br>
<i>&gt;nor a call for censorship: merely, an observation yet to be refuted.</i><br>
<p>
This goes with the territory.  If we are introducing new concepts as<br>
transhumans and especially extropian transhumans, how we present what could<br>
be seen as threatening concepts that shake the ground people walk on --<br>
then, a sense of diplomacy, presentation and marketing is essential. I can't<br>
tell anyone else how to present new ideas, but I am sure that if I want to<br>
be successful, I will take careful notice of how a public might respond. If<br>
I want a pubic to respond with opened arms, I'll not hit them over the head<br>
with threatening concepts, but attempt a warm and inviting constant.<br>
<p>
Thanks, Sarah, for igniting my brain cells. Your posts are always so<br>
well-written.<br>
