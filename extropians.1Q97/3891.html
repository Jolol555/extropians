<p>
First, I have noted that most geniuses are not usually born with genius<br>
parents or relatives, it often appears quite suddenly in a family (look at<br>
Gauss for an example). Note that intelligence on the other hand often runs<br>
in families; research has shown that there are genetic correlations<br>
between the intelligence of siblings, even when raised apart, and an<br>
intelligent family of course provides a more stimulating environment to<br>
grow up in.  But genius seems to pop up on its own (of course, I suspect<br>
that there is no firm division between genius and high intelligence;<br>
genius is mostly an acknowledgment of excellent achievements). <br>
<p>
Second, according to what I have read and heard, geniuses doesn't seem to <br>
develop without plenty of motivation. This motivation can be both <br>
internal and external, but genius doesn't seem to develop if there isn't <br>
a receptive medium for it. Without training/experimentation they don't <br>
become geniuses.<br>
