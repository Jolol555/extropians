<i>&gt; And as for my fine proclamations about truth - and that's a small 't',</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lyle! - </i><br>
<p>
Well... &lt;g&gt;  check out what you wrote on January 7:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I want the Final Answers.  </i><br>
<p>
Capital F, capital A... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The burning search for that takes precedence over everything else.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; What can I do without the Truth?   How can I know </i><br>
<i>&gt; what I'm doing or why I should be doing it without the Truth?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Doubting isn't just a hobby or even just a way of life.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is an action taken with a specific and most final goal  in mind:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; To Know everything that matters.</i><br>
<p>
capital K, capital T:   FAKT.  <br>
<p>
Now, getting back to the matter at hand:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I visited Hugo de Garis's page.  I did not see a list of scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; studies supporting his assertion.  I saw an emotional argument </i><br>
<i>&gt; for male supremacy, based on self-righteousness.  </i><br>
<p>
That may be what you saw, but that's not what is on the page.  <br>
It's true that he doesn't give a list of scientific studies; I don't think <br>
your reaction would have been any different if he had.  The facts <br>
on this issue are readily available, and you could have looked them up <br>
yourself before commenting on this thread.  <br>
<p>
What fascinates me about this is that I wrote exactly the same thing <br>
when I was your age.  I was anti-racist and anti-sexist; I was every bit <br>
as strident, every bit as self-righteous, as you.  This behaviour has <br>
puzzled me ever since.  <br>
<p>
It isn't a matter of indoctrination.  When I was a teenager, there was <br>
no such thing as political correctness.  I don't think the word "sexism" <br>
had been invented yet.  The feminist movement was dormant in the <br>
1950s and early 60s.  Racism wasn't an issue; racism was taken for <br>
granted.  But I was PC anyway.  It was people like me who invented <br>
political correctness.  Like Hugo de Garis, I was a male feminist.  <br>
I was also a white anti-racist.  De Garis doesn't discuss this point, <br>
but we grew up in similar circumstances at about the same time, and    <br>
if I read between the lines correctly, this applies to him too.  <br>
<p>
When I was in the 8th or 9th grade -- age 13 or 14 -- I was given the <br>
assignment in English class, to write a short story.  I wrote a story <br>
in which my dad was a newspaper editor who wrote editorials in favor <br>
of integration.  The leader of the Ku Klux Klan was hiding in the <br>
bushes in front of our house, with a beaker of sulfuric acid, which <br>
he was going to throw into my dad's face.  Our dog flushed him out, <br>
and saved the day.  <br>
<p>
There was *nothing* in my background that would have given rise<br>
to this story.  My dad was a corporation lawyer, a conservative <br>
Republican, too chickenshit to join the Klan, but definitely racist.  <br>
I lived in an all-white neighborhood, and had never known any black <br>
people, except the maid who came over once a week to help my mother <br>
clean up the house.  Where did that story come from?   To this day, <br>
I still don't know.  <br>
<p>
But I want to know.  I want to Know.  I want to trace this phenomenon <br>
back to its roots.  Why are we driven to destroy ourselves?  <br>
<p>
De Garis has made the transition from being a guilty male feminist <br>
to being a proud white male, but he doesn't seem to have a clue about <br>
why any of this happens.  <br>
<p>
As I read over your post, Eliezer, I see one thing:  you feel threatened.  <br>
Your self-concept is at stake.  The issue, to you,  is not whether <br>
there ever has been or ever could be a female Goedel or a female Bach;  <br>
the only issue is whether you or de Garis is the better man.  Why?  <br>
<p>
