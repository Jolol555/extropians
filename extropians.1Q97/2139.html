In a message dated 97-02-01 10:49:40 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Our bodies are manifesations of our minds and our spirits?  Am I on the<br>
 right list?  If I am not could someone point me to a less superstitious<br>
 list?  I would hardly say that our bodies are the maniefsations of our<br>
 minds and spirits.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This is not a superstitious list, I suspect you knew that ; I agree on the<br>
surface this statement sounds a bit ambiguous.<br>
If you took these words as mystic I did not. Example:  body builder eats and<br>
exercises from her/his mind... his "spirit" is his will, (disciplined or not)<br>
and (s)he finds him/herself as changed... through manifestaion of intent....<br>
Our body is the easiest to automorph, in fact.<br>
Our posture, our facial expressions, vocal tones, movement , grace and poise<br>
all reflect our self esteem, our inner self...<br>
In fact, if we have money, we can freely exchange our features for ones that<br>
suit us better...<br>
It is controlled by our mind...  made concrete by our will....<br>
I agree with Lyle.<br>
<p>
ON WITH THE AUTOMORPH!<br>
