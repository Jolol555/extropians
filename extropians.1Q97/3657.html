Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick is fairly well-known to Extropians<br>
through his books "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" (1974) (which Nozick has<br>
since repudiated), "Philosophical Explanations" (1981), "The Examined Life:<br>
 Philosophical Meditations" (1989), and "The Nature of Rationality" (1993).<br>
 I thought about doing a review of "Rationality" at one time, but just<br>
couldn't bring myself to do it, I couldn't take the book seriously enough. <br>
It was filled with politically correct sops to the scientific left, it was<br>
organized incoherently, and it tried to illegitimately slip in something<br>
called "symbolic utility" into rational decision models.  Nozick is a good<br>
list maker, something he did a good bit of in "Rationality", "Examined<br>
Life", and "Explanations", but not much of a thinker.  Harvard has fallen<br>
on hard times in its philosophy department, Nozick is no Santayana.<br>
<p>
Anyway, Roger Kimball has written an essay about an Australian philosopher,<br>
entitled "Who Was David Stove?" in "The New Criterion" March 1997, who<br>
analytically ripped Nozick to pieces.  I like this guy, Kimball says of<br>
him, "Whatever the subject, he finds the tenderest spot of the most<br>
sensitive nerve; then he presses."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From David Stove's review of "Philosophical Explanations":</i><br>
<p>
  "An unprecedented expansion of communism took place immediately after the<br>
second world war.  For the next twenty-odd years, any possibility of<br>
resistance to communist expansion depended almost entirely upon America: <br>
no other country possessed both the requisite military capacity and the<br>
willingness to use it.  But the outcome of the Vietnam war showed that,<br>
while America's capacity for such resistance remained intact, her<br>
willingness did not.  For that war was lost, not through defeat of American<br>
armies in the field, nor yet through treachery among them, but through a<br>
massive sedition at home.  The nation showed that it had become utterly<br>
opposed to any further armed resistance to communism."<br>
<p>
An excellent summary of exactly what happened.  The "massive sedition" was,<br>
of course, what is sometimes referred to as "memetic engineering," fomented<br>
by the Soviets through a well-funded disinformation campaign taking root<br>
amongst the always left-leaning Western intellectuals and media types.  The<br>
KGB archives recently opened up have been a real eye opener into just how<br>
thorough the penetration of our cultural elites was.  The campaign was<br>
helped along by the passive acceptance of scientific nihilism by Western<br>
academia because scientific rationality was the only authority left on the<br>
scene after the Enlightenment destroyed all notion of higher authority.<br>
<p>
As a prime example of this seditious memetic engineering still with us<br>
today, Stove examines Nozick's call for a "non-coercive philosophy," which<br>
went so far in the utopian absolutist direction as to replace healthy<br>
'arguments' with sickly 'explanations,' because it would be wrong "to get<br>
someone to believe something whether he wants to believe it or not." <br>
Sheesh!  Why not just throw yourself in front of a bus and get it over<br>
with?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Stove's review again:</i><br>
<p>
  "The completeness of Nozick's composition is remarkable:  he touches<br>
somewhere in the book, however lightly, almost every note of American<br>
decadence.  Gandhi is there.  The necessary deference to feminism is there.<br>
 The necessary reproof to 'racism' is there.  Carlos Castaneda is there,<br>
referred to as though he were a thinker, which he is not....  Drugs of<br>
course are there, and in no unfavorable light:  drugs may have their place,<br>
Nozick thinks, in 'the treatment for philosophical parochialism.'  Has he<br>
left anything out?  Is there anyone in post-Vietnam America who needs to be<br>
placated, whom he has not placated?  This was obviously a worry, and there<br>
is a nervous catch-all reference to 'children's rights, the treatment of<br>
animals, domination and ecological awareness.'"<br>
<p>
Ugh, these wussies who slavishly toe the anointed's ideological line do not<br>
have unqualified existence.  Pah!  The pulse may be there, but where's the<br>
cognitive sparkle?<br>
<p>
Stove again:<br>
<p>
  "...No ideal could be more destructive of human life than the ideal of<br>
non-coerciveness.  [The only way] of producing a non-coercive human being<br>
is to produce an autistic one.  But then, autism is really the conclusion<br>
to which Nozick's conception of philosophy tends, just as it is the<br>
conclusion to which American foreign policy in the same period has tended."<br>
<p>
The First Commandment of the therapeutic welfare state is "Don't judge." <br>
This shares the same culture of death memetic lineage with Nozick's<br>
"non-coercion" absolutist philosophy.  "Don't judge" is an axiom of<br>
barbarism, Nozick's version of "non-coercion" is a philosophy of barbarism.<br>
<p>
Miguel de Unamuno, in "Tragic Life", didn't refer to the conclusion of this<br>
philosophy as autism, but his description of the consequences of its<br>
practice amounts to the same thing:<br>
<p>
  "The most fruitful ethic is the ethic of mutual imposition.  My endeavor<br>
to impose myself upon another, to be and live in him and by him, to make<br>
him mine, which is the same as making my self his, is what gives... meaning<br>
to... human solidarity.  The individual qua individual, the wretched<br>
individual who lives a prey to the senses and to the instinct of<br>
self-preservation, cares only about preserving himself, and his sole<br>
concern is to keep others from forcing their way into his sphere, to keep<br>
them from disturbing him, from interrupting his idleness; and in return for<br>
their abstention, or for the sake of example, he refrains from forcing<br>
himself upon them, from taking possession of them.  'Do not do unto others<br>
what you would not have them do unto you,' he translates as:  'I do not<br>
interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'  And he shrinks<br>
back, and pines and perishes in this rut of spiritual avarice, in the<br>
slough of the repellent ethic... of each one for himself.  And inasmuch as<br>
each one is not himself alone, he can scarcely live for himself alone. <br>
Sloth, it is said, is the mother of all vices..., while it professes to<br>
preserve us by economizing our forces, in reality works toward lessening us<br>
and reducing us to nothing.  When spirit is in excess and man feels a<br>
hunger for yet more of it, he pours his own spirit out and spreads it<br>
abroad, and as it pours out it grows by contact with the spirits of others;<br>
when, on the other hand, avarice takes hold, man withdraws into himself,<br>
thinking thus to better preserve himself, and ends by losing everything,<br>
like the man who was endowed with a single talent and buried it so as not<br>
to lose it, only to find himself without it altogether."<br>
<p>
This sloth, and this shrinking into oneself that Unamuno refers to, is<br>
Stove's autism.  Nozick's "non-coercion philosophy" is based on the same<br>
twisted translation of the Golden Rule that Unamuno pointed out 76 years<br>
earlier, 'I do not interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'<br>
 The premise is utterly false.  Each individual interferes with other<br>
living entities from the moment of conception onward.  We all continuously<br>
appropriate other entities' space, time, matter and energy without asking<br>
permission.  To not see this can only be accomplished by a wilful studied<br>
ignorance of the unintended consequences of life processes, or<br>
self-delusion.  Such self-delusion is widespread in our compost-modern age,<br>
arising from the false judgment that is the consequence of programs to<br>
coerce consent from unsuspecting populations, as outlined in my "Critique"<br>
in "Extropy" #17.<br>
