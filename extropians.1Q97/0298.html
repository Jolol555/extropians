It also strikes me that men would be judging the criteria of genius, based on<br>
men's favorite pursuits and passions. Women may have been cooking, sewing and<br>
chilraising geniouses at all times, but the things they had done were not<br>
calculated into in our male society anwyay!<br>
<p>
Genius is a value call. The things we do are often predicated on what we<br>
value, and what we value is decided by "the collective" or religion or<br>
whatever - all too often.<br>
