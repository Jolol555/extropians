<i>&gt; &gt;equations/calculations/methodology for  coming to these conclusion....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Even though I still love em. i'm just curious....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have a number of sources for my data, by the vast majority of my equations</i><br>
<i>&gt; and calculational information came from the book "Design of Structures to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Resist Nuclear Weapons Effects" from the American Society of Civil Engineers</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ASCE) Manuals and Reports on Engineering Practice No. 42 (ISBN:0-87262-439-0).</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is essentually 300+ pages of everything you ever wanted to know about</i><br>
<i>&gt; structural engineering in nuclear environments.  It forced me to dust off my</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineering skills, since I don't use them professionally.  There is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundreds of empirical and heuristical equations and data covering every</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible aspect of this subject.  I got some of my data from books, and some</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the 'net.  I also was able to glean some technical information from</i><br>
<i>&gt; DoE.  The meteor impact information was retrieved from various sites from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the net, mostly NASA and .edu sites.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Calculations for the lunar environment are actually much simpler because</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are far fewer factors involved.  The difficulty was that all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; equations assume an earthbound environment.  Removing the extraneous factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; was subject to quite a bit of error.  This is why I finally used underground</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear testing as a baseline for my calculations.  After you get a decent</i><br>
<i>&gt; set of baseline data, all that is left is a lot of number crunching, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing terribly difficult.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you want to know all the equations involved, I recommend the above</i><br>
<i>&gt; mentioned book.  It is very thorough, technically complete, and designed as</i><br>
<i>&gt; an engineering handbook.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;General Grant, I will respectfully accept your surrender when you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;finally come to your senses..... he he....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've remained mostly non-partisan in this discussion (because I don't really</i><br>
<i>&gt; care; it is just an interesting bit of calculation), but my personal opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that UNLESS the moon was extremely well developed and populated, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not be able to adequately defend itself against a determined assault from</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth.  In the case of a minimally developed moon, it would be too easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; permanently damage an already precarious economy and environment.  The lunar</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment would be more or less permanently dependant on earth for things</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as organic materials.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the moon was fully developed however (like a small planet), then I see no</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why it could not be adequately defended.  It is mostly a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributing your economy and not having all your eggs in one basket.</i><br>
<p>
Well, yes, any new nation would want to be as diverse as possible before<br>
really tossing the tea, so to speak, as a given. I am expecting however<br>
that a winnable scenario would have a decent chance (&gt;20-30%) of<br>
occuring with a half a million people on the moon, up to 50% with at<br>
least a million people. Given the situation where so long as the lunies<br>
can ride out whatever happens on earth, like the king of the hill, they<br>
have beyond the mere military conflict the political chance of winning.<br>
People on earth are fat and lazy, and as evidenced by conflicts in this<br>
generation, are not willing to fight and die unless it is their own<br>
backyard. If you think people wondered at why we were in Vietnam, the<br>
moon is 230,000 miles farther away than that...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; SIDE NOTE (TRIVIA YOU BOTH MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You wouldn't necessarily have to put really large rocks into orbit.  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt; are already orbiting the earth.  According to astronomers, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like 13 non-trivial natural bodies orbiting earth.  Discounting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the moon (which is one of them)  I believe the sizes range from about</i><br>
<i>&gt; 50-2000 meters in diameter.  Simply the threat of dropping a big one (say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1000 meters) into an ocean should be sufficient deterrent from attack.  An</i><br>
<i>&gt; ocean drop doesn't have to be accurate, and would destroy *a lot* of coastal</i><br>
<i>&gt; cities and lands.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
So there is already a deterrent capability and all this posturing is<br>
moot. All that remains is one corporation with the balls enough to go up<br>
and grab the opportunity. now don't raise your hands too quick now.....<br>
