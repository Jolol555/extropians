Von Neumann was at a dinner when the hostess posed this old problem:<br>
<p>
Two bicyclists start 100 miles apart, and head towards each other, each<br>
one going 10 mph.  At the same instant, a fly leaves the first bike and<br>
flies at 20 mph to the second.  When it gets there, it immediately turns<br>
around and heads back to the first.  Then it repeats, going back and forth<br>
between the two bikers.  By the time they reach each other, how far will<br>
the fly have travelled?<br>
<p>
The easy way to solve this problem is to realize that the bikers are<br>
approaching each other at a net speed of 20 mph, so it will take 5 hours<br>
for them to meet.  During that time the fly is travelling constantly,<br>
back and forth, at 20 mph, so in 5 hours it will travel exactly 100 miles,<br>
and that is the answer.<br>
<p>
The harder way is to sum an infinite series.  The first leg has the fly<br>
meeting the biker at a net speed of 30 mph.  They start off 100 miles<br>
apart so it takes 3 1/3 hours to meet, during which the fly travels 66 2/3<br>
miles.  Now the fly will turn around.  By this time the bikers have<br>
drawn to 33 1/3 miles apart.  So this second leg of the trip will take<br>
1/3 as long.  Similarly the third leg will take 1/3 of the second, or 1/9<br>
of the first, and so in indefinitely, with each leg taking 1/3 as long<br>
(and hence the fly going 1/3 as far) as the previous one.  So the answer<br>
will be 66 2/3 times (1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...).  The value of that<br>
infinite series is exactly 1 1/2, so the answer is 66 2/3 times 1 1/2,<br>
or 100 miles.<br>
<p>
Von Neumann thought for a brief moment and gave the answer.  The hostess<br>
was disappointed and said, oh, you saw the trick, most people try to sum<br>
the infinite series.  Von Neumann looked surprised and said, but that's<br>
how I did it.  (Cue laughter/applause.)<br>
<p>
Actually, doing the infinite series isn't that hard, as you can see above.<br>
I'm sure he was really smart, though.<br>
