Thanks for the clarification.  The terms non-racist and non-sexist are <br>
new to me.  Your distinction is certainly more fine-grained than the <br>
vaguer referent I had in mind where anti-racist and anti-sexist just <br>
meant being against racism and sexism, not necessarily implying any <br>
need for protest or desire for affirmative action.<br>
<p>
I guess I'll have to work on my language transparency some more...<br>
