<p>
I don't know how we could be certain we were successful in giving the<br>
computer emotions. I do know however that the computer will first need<br>
the sensors to feel with in the first place. If that computer had<br>
artificial cognitive intelligence, perhaps it would begin to show signs<br>
of irrationality. If a person were uploaded into the computer, they<br>
would know immiediately if that computer were experiencing emotions. If<br>
the artificial intelligence were sufficiently intelligent, it could<br>
probably tell us it was having a condition that it what was unfamiliar<br>
with. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; (My personal view is that the hardware doesn't matter; after all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; stimulating a sensor or nerve produces the same sensation, so the qualia</i><br>

<i>&gt; different hardware)</i><br>
<p>
I agree different hardware other than the brain could suffice, but not<br>
just any hardware. The hardware does have to have the capacity to<br>
experience sensation. It does not really matter where the qualia is<br>
occuring, just as long as it is felt and not just thought. If it is<br>
merely thought then there is not any affective emotion occuring. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would be quite possible to create programs that can watch their</i><br>
<i>&gt; internal states and hence feel internal pleasure, no hardware needed. </i><br>
Whoa, big jump there from analysing conditions to feeling pleasure. My<br>
computer can determine how fast it is operating in many different ways,<br>
but just because it is aware of these internal processes does not mean<br>
it can "hence feel internal pleasure". An alarm clock is aware of when<br>
it should go off, but it doesn't get emotionally excited about the fact.<br>
It just responds to these things logically; not emotionally. <br>
<p>
In<br>
<i>&gt; fact, programs that watch or affect their own states have been written</i><br>
<i>&gt; (but as far as I know nobody has done anything truly serious with it).</i><br>
<p>
I would be extremely interested in a program which was claimed to<br>
"affect" its own states, but the fact of the matter is, such programs<br>
are "effecting" their own states, just as nearly every program does.<br>
<p>

Inwards!<br>
