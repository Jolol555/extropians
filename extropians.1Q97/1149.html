Omega, on 22 Jan. 1997:<br>
<i>&gt;a. The rapid rate of change of technology, combined with</i><br>
<i>&gt;b. The comparatively slow rate change of culture, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;c. The possible genetic obstacles in modifying culture,</i><br>
<i>&gt;will result in the question of gender roles becoming moot long before</i><br>
<i>&gt;our society resolves these issues in any significant way.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting post.  The past history of technological change does <br>
reveal a pattern of social structures lagging behind innovations.  <br>
When one looks at the nexus of gender roles and technology, however, <br>
we see little change in gender roles brought about by new <br>
technologies.  An example:  One of the Smithsonian museums recently <br>
mounted a fascinating retrospective of the ways in which modern <br>
technologies were marketed to women, and the central uniting concept of <br>
that exhibition was how little women's roles changed as a result.<br>
<p>
One caveat:  several years will pass before we can observe whether <br>
there has been any noticeable effect of the Internet on gender roles.  <br>
<p>
I contend that humans possess the ability NOW to abandon <br>
culturally-constructed gender roles, and they could do so regardless <br>
of technological advancement.  Clearly entire segments of the <br>
population would like to do away with at least some of the divisions. <br>
The barriers to this human advancement are not technological in <br>
nature but, rather, found within imbedded societal power structures.  <br>
(I notice that it is when power structures are involved that the <br>
concept of memetics seems to break down.  Is anyone doing any work in <br>
this area?)<br>
