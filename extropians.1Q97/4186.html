These are big subjects which I don't have time to go into just now. <br>
I'll just say that: of course collectivists can occasionally do advanced<br>
research, but at the cost of potential social progress that, if not made,<br>
will lead in the long run to unrest and revolution, as happened in the<br>
USSR; as I understand it, the Nazis had centralised control of their<br>
economy, and their capitalism was not capitalism but mercantilism;<br>
the collectivisation of the US space program for the sake of a<br>
boondoggle in the 60s  *set back* space research from relevant trends (<br>
flying craft that could take off from the ground and go into orbit, like<br>
the spy planes of the 50s were tending towards) to irrelevant trends<br>
(staged rockets).<br>
