The main issue which I find disturbing in cloning and similar proposals<br>
is, what about the children produced?  Who defends their interests, and to<br>
what extent should I condone someone performing experiments which may lead<br>
to children who suffer from brain damage or deformities?  Apparently it<br>
took &gt; 100 tries to produce Dolly the sheep.  I wouldn't be surprised<br>
if they had some pretty messed-up lambs along the way.<br>
<p>
The same issue arises with more conventional technology, like in vitro<br>
fertilization, of course.  I guess that's pretty reliable now.  You can't<br>
make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, so if we have to produce a<br>
few scrambled babies before we get good at it, is that fine with everyone?<br>
<p>
It's really not a self ownership issue, it's a question of child ownership.<br>
I see this as a classic gray area; I would be much more willing to intervene<br>
on behalf of another child being injured by his parent than to try to stop<br>
a person from hurting himself.<br>
