Schramek is an amateur astronomer, not an astrologer. Last fall, he took<br>
a picture of Hale-Bopp through his telescope, and happened to include a<br>
9th magnitude star in the picture. He negligently misused some<br>
star-catalogue software to come to the conclusion that the object (the<br>
star) was not in the catalogue, and therefore, due to the saturn-like<br>
distortion in the photograph (caused by the optical qualities of CCD<br>
telescope cameras), that the object had to b artificial, and that it was<br>
as big as Hale Bopp. He reported this on the Art Bell radio show, and<br>
from there it went haywire all over the net, AOL, and among various new<br>
age kooks.<br>
<p>
When Bopp came out with a web page and went on Art Bell to prove<br>
Schramek wrong with a demonstration of the proper use of the catalogue<br>
to show that the object was indeed a star, Schramek refused to<br>
acknowledge his error, and Bopp got pummelled via email by all sorts of<br>
nuts who had eaten up the story.<br>

BTW, Simpson is losing his Heisman trophy now isn't he.....<br>
