<i>&gt; Until very, very recently, much of the Earth remained inaccessible to clean</i><br>
<i>&gt; lines of communication.  And very, very soon, should we prevail in our drive</i><br>
<i>&gt; to escape Earth, a great human diaspora will set forth.  If faster-than-light</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication remains beyond our power, we will lose touch with each other as</i><br>
<i>&gt; we spread through the universe.  </i><br>
<p>
No, we won't.<br>
<p>
In order for any thinking to be done at the fringes, the fringes have to<br>
be moving slower than light.  (See "Universal Non-Point of Light.")  To<br>
put it another way, you can't lose touch, in the warm n' fuzzy sense,<br>
with something that isn't thinking.  So fringe A can send a beam of<br>
light to fringe B, going in the opposite direction, which will reach it<br>
in a finite amount of time.  Fringe B's reply will reach fringe A, again<br>
in a finite amount of time (*).  So the fringes never fall out of<br>
communication - as long as relativity applies, we remain one big happy<br>
geometrically expanding family.<br>
<p>
(*)  In fact, exactly the same amount of time.  If B measures the amount<br>
of time it takes the ray to reach A, and the amount of time it takes the<br>
reply to return (assuming composition is instantaneous), they are<br>
exactly equal - assuming B's velocity is constant.  Question 1:  Why? <br>
Doesn't B move farther away from A after the reply is sent?  Question<br>
2:  B says sending=reply.  Fringe A says the same thing, except A's<br>
"sending" is B's "reply", and vice versa.  Doesn't this mean<br>
sending=reply=sending=reply=sending..., thus making (by induction)<br>
communication time constant even as A and B move farther and farther<br>
away from each other?<br>
