The first sign of what's coming is the stock market.  It continues to <br>
forge ahead.  This is the great Victory-of-Capitalism Bull Market.  <br>
As the market penetrates into all corners of the earth, the economy <br>
becomes more stable.  There will be no more recessions.  That part of <br>
history is over.  There will be no more bear markets, at least not <br>
for the market as a whole.  Individual stocks, and individual countries, <br>
will go up and down.  But the aggregate will grow steadily, and in fact <br>
the stock market will grow at increasing rates.  In recent years it has <br>
been in the 20 - 30% range.  It will move into the 50 - 60% range in the <br>
next couple of years, and then into the 100 - 200% range.  And on up <br>
from there.  <br>
<p>
As the economy grows exponentially, governments find themselves <br>
with vastly increased tax revenues, and they find that they can pay off <br>
their national debts, and then reduce taxes.  <br>
<p>
Education will become entirely privatized, and it will become the <br>
new growth industry.  It will be as innovative as the computer industry.  <br>
New curricula and improved teaching methods will be introduced <br>
every year, and their effectiveness will increase by a factor of ten every <br>
n years.  This is Lyle's First Law, analogous to Moore's Law;  <br>
n remains to be determined.  <br>
<p>
In the last few years, large bookstores have been opening at an ever <br>
increasing rate.  Where we used to have a few little mom and pop <br>
bookstores, we now have Borders, Bookstar, and Barnes &amp; Noble.  <br>
These stores are appearing even in places that didn't used to have <br>
bookstores at all -- I saw a Barnes &amp; Noble in Amarillo last summer.  <br>
A generation ago, people in Amarillo only read books by Hal Lindsay <br>
and Billy Graham.  Now they are literate enough to support a new <br>
Barnes &amp; Noble store.  This is only the beginning.  As Lyle's Law <br>
takes effect, the intelligence of the populace will grow so fast that <br>
bookstores will be as common as supermarkets.  Every town that has a <br>
Walmart will also have a Borders.  Most of the shelf space in these <br>
stores will be devoted to computer books.  Most of these books will be <br>
attempts to explain how to use Windows 95.  <br>
<p>
The NeXT MacIntosh (you saw that expression first right here)  <br>
will appear in two or three years.  It will be a dream machine, but <br>
almost no one will buy it, because at that point Wintel owns the world.  <br>
By the turn of the century, Mac OS and Unix will be as almost as <br>
defunct as Amiga.   <br>
<p>
Windows 95 will be replaced by Windows 2001, which will be <br>
an order of magnitude bigger and more complex than Windows 95, <br>
and which will require more supervision than a 1970s mainframe.  <br>
Even small businesses will have to have a systems programmer <br>
to keep their software running properly and their hardware connected.  <br>
People who have computer-based home entertainment systems <br>
connected to the internet -- which will be almost everybody -- will also <br>
have to employ consultants to set up and maintain their computers.  <br>
<p>
In large corporations, MIS departments will reassert themselves, and <br>
reclaim the turf they lost in the 1980s, when PCs appeared on desks <br>
everywhere, and could not be controlled by a central authority.  Now, <br>
once again, a priesthood of systems programmers will be necessary <br>
to run a corporation's computers.  But it won't be a small priesthood,   <br>
it will be an ever-increasing part of the entire company.  <br>
<p>
Lyle's Second Law:  system software will increase in size <br>
and complexity by a factor of ten every m years, where m is to be <br>
determined.  <br>
<p>
If, as seems probable, m &lt; n, then future releases of Windows will <br>
absorb whatever surplus intelligence is generated by the improved <br>
educational system, so the net result is zero.  More and more people <br>
will get more and more education so they can spend more and more <br>
time installing software and making it run with other software, and <br>
sometimes using it.  <br>
<p>
Returning to our starting point, this is what the exponentially growing <br>
economy consists of:  more and more people maintaining software, <br>
writing device drivers, answering phone calls from customers who <br>
can't get things to work, and so forth -- and teaching other people <br>
how to do these things.  This is all economic activity.  As these <br>
activities increase exponentially, the economy expands with them.  <br>
