<i>&gt;We've had push media for a long time. It's called television. The media</i><br>
<i>&gt;conspiring to eliminate interactivity is not good. The media sees (with some</i><br>
<i>&gt;exception) the internet as a slow expensive television. Do we want that? I</i><br>
<i>&gt;think Pointcast is a pain in the ass, and I thought it was several months</i><br>
<i>&gt;ago when it first appeared (not when I saw it in Wired). If I want to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;news, I'll get the news I want when I want it. Pointcast is an overrated</i><br>
<i>&gt;screen saver.</i><br>

Ahh but can you customize precisely the programming you'd like to recieve<br>
on your television or choose from many unofficial sources of programming?<br>
How about create a user profile like firefly or my-yahoo to use collective<br>
intelligence so that the profile learns what you like and fits the<br>
information specifically to your liking and enjoyment. This sort of<br>
technology could inspire quite a number of people. Imagine the sort of<br>
individuality that will grow and blossom out of having a profile created<br>
exactly to your liking and changing as you change. Anonymities will also<br>
allow the growth of individuality which will bleed out into everyday life.<br>
No ones going to browse the web for hours on end looking for news with<br>
search tools. Mass media may recognize push technology as slow television<br>
but the truth is, everyone will be able to broadcast push technology just<br>
like this mailinglist was pushed into your inbox. Microsoft is designing a<br>
batch of HTML tags specifically so that everyone can generate push-media.<br>
See the false image of push-media being like television will cause<br>
advertisers to pour onto the scene and along with them, $$. Push-Technology<br>
isn't a replacement for the web, it only serves as a front door to it. It's<br>
merely a way to deliver your favorite websites and all their content<br>
directly to your PC automatically saving you all the time of net congestion<br>
or overly busy websites. This is NOT an end to personal choice and very<br>
very far away from simple channel flipping. No, no. This stuff 'learns' all<br>
your interests and even suggests new information. You can follow links on<br>
incoming pushed information to take you anywhere that may cause you to have<br>
new interests which you can also subscribe to have pushed to you which<br>
alters your profile and continues the perpetual cycle. The future of your<br>
identity will no longer be your social security # or DNA, your personality<br>
is the only thing that is 'you'. Profiles will be infinately important as<br>
well as brainwaves. Get ready for profile-based dating systems, book<br>
recommendations, music recommendations, etc. The future is SMART.<br>
