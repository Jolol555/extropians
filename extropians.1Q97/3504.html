Schrader:<br>
<i>&gt; No disagreement here, really.  The time period that I was referring to </i><br>
<i>&gt; starts pre-cambrian.  Human history is only a tiny part of it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Human genes are greatly the result of the evolution of pre-human critters.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The vast majority of that time there was no wealth, unless clams got money.</i><br>
<p>
Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt; While much of the evolution of morphology might be pre-human, almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of the evolution of /behavior/ likely happened after we took the</i><br>
<i>&gt; basic shape now doing the behaving.  Perhaps most of the perceptions</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolved before that, but muscular behaviors and social behaviors must</i><br>
<i>&gt; have evolved much later, after our muscles and groups looked more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ones we have now.  Behavioral evolution is very fast.</i><br>
 <br>
Schrader:<br>
<i>&gt; The point that I was trying to make was that, if we treat DNA as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; language, there are no words in the human genome for 'rich', and</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably insufficient syntax to talk about riches.</i><br>
<p>
Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt; Anything that affects behavior can be 'encoded in DNA'. </i><br>
<p>
Schrader:<br>
<i>&gt; True, but not sufficient.  Yes, behaviors can be encoded.  However wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not a behavioral concept.  It is a social construction, and there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no definite connection between behavior and wealth.  Wealth-recognizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; or wealth-producing behavior in one society doesn't always work in another.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The very fact that the correlation between wealth and family size is </i><br>
<i>&gt; cross-cultural is therefore proof that it isn't genetic.  QED.</i><br>
<p>
Crocker: <br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, no sale.  All it proves is that the particular kind of wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; measured in the study was probably not the same as what caused the result.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To postulate some genetic cause, you would indeed have to have some</i><br>
<i>&gt; less culturally-biased measure that happens to correlate with wealth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obesity seems like the obvious one.  That's something common to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealthy in every primitive society and most modern ones. </i><br>
<p>
What source did you get this from?  It's an impressive piece of research if<br>
true.<br>
BTW, even then it's not enough: it of course has to show obesity during <br>
primary childbearing years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any number of things might cause it.  Just because the particular measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "wealth" used in the initial study is a modern phenomenon doesn't mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there isn't some more fundamental variable not postulated that</i><br>
<i>&gt; correlates well with modern wealth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Language of DNA" is not the right way to treat "genes", because it leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the wrong conclusions.  The fact that what we call a "gene", i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the inheritable whatever-it-is that results in some trait, is implemented</i><br>
<i>&gt; in DNA is no reason to limit its effects to the proximal effects of</i><br>
<i>&gt; DNA protein synthesis.  Yes, DNA is a language for doing one thing;</i><br>
<i>&gt; but since the effects 100 steps further along in the chain of causality</i><br>
<i>&gt; can still materially differ when the DNA differs, and the /difference/</i><br>
<i>&gt; causes selection, it makes perfect sense to say that this 100-levels-</i><br>
<i>&gt; removed-from-DNA phenomenon is selected genetically, because it carries</i><br>
<i>&gt; that chunk of DNA into the next generation regardless of whether it</i><br>
<i>&gt; "coded" for the trait or not.</i><br>
<p>
I won't quibble over words this time.  I agree that the effects of DNA are<br>
not limited to protein synthesis, nor even to subsequent behaviors.  And,<br>
yes, *if* there are 100 causally linked events, then even the last is <br>
selected genetically.<br>
But the basic question still remains: can those links survive the<br>
turbulence of society?  I still suspect not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, I'm not saying that there /is/ a genetic basis.  I agree that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is probably less likely than a cultural one.  I only point out that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea of a genetic basis is much less far-fetched than in might sound.</i><br>
<p>
We seem to be agreeing a lot more than disagreeing.  I think we have <br>
succeeded in narrowing the issue down to a small grey area that requires <br>
tremendous research to clarify much further.  Shall we allow this thread<br>
to retire gracefully?<br>
