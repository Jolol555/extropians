<i>        &gt;suppose [...] It turns out that ESP and telepathy is possible with         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the right training. In time you learn to  directly perceive the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;innards of another person's mind. You see what he sees, follow his         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;thoughts, feel what it is like to be him. Now, if you're going to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;start suggesting that you don't know if this is real         </i><br>
<p>
No, I am not suggesting that. The emotion I feel when I use my ESP to probe <br>
your mind is absolutely real, no doubt about it. The question is, is it the <br>
same emotion that you experience? It's far from obvious that it is, after all, <br>
the exact same input can make you very happy and me very sad.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;that you can't be sure that you are really feeling what he feels         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But how can I be sure? I don't have ESP but I often see people and think that <br>
if I were in their position I would be very  happy, but I'm not the one in <br>
that situation, and they are and to my surprise they tell me they're <br>
miserable.  <br>
<p>
There is a problem when you say what would I be like if I were you, or what<br>
would this be like if it were that, because then it wouldn't be "this"  <br>
anymore. The problem is not too bad if the two things are similar, it makes  <br>
some sense to ask "what would this apple be like if it were blue", it would  <br>
make less sense to ask "what would this apple be like if it were a blue  <br>
banana. <br>
<p>
Asking what somebody else's subjective experience would be like if it were  <br>
yours, is like asking what would this post be like if it were a blue giraffe.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;then this starts to sound like solipsism.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is a separate issue, but I could not function if I really thought that  <br>
solipsism was true, so I take it as an axiom that  it is not. You claim that  <br>
a proof that solipsism is not true can be found, I think any such proof would  <br>
be flawed.        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You would be directly perceiving his mind</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Even with ESP there would have to be a translating mechanism from your mind <br>
to mine, and something could get lost in the translation.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If the person whose mind I am reading agrees with my statements         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;about what he seems to be feeling,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We both agree that a stop light and a tomato are the same color, but how can <br>
I know if the color you subjectively experience is the same one I do?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if other people reading his mind perceive the same things I do,                  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I have no way of knowing if other people perceive the same thing that I do,  <br>
the only thing I know about is the sound other people make with their mouth.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;then I have grounds for believing them  to be real.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, you certainly do have good grounds for believing that other  <br>
conscious minds are real, I believe it too, we just don't have proof. I am <br>
far less certain that the subjective experience those other minds have is <br>
very similar to mine, but I'll never know for sure.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's not clear what it means for John Clark to be Hal Finney, and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;how that differs from Hal Finney being Hal Finney.           </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't care what it's like when John Clark pretends to be Hal Finney,  <br>
what's it like to be the real Hal Finney?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Suppose that while John Clark is being Hal Finney, he feels exactly         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the same as Hal Finney being Hal Finney. Then, when the mind reading        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is over, he goes back to feeling like John Clark, but he still has         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;his memories of what it felt like to be Hal Finney </i><br>
                                  <br>
But then Hal's memories would be interpreted by John Clark not by Hal Finney.<br>
