<i>        &gt;Value is intrinisic to meaning. </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
You can't have value without meaning, but you can have meaning without value. <br>
If it were otherwise then "value" and "meaning" would be synonyms. <br>
They're not.<br>
<p>
Haven't you ever been suckered into going to a very boring speech of zero <br>
value where somebody is explaining in excruciating detail something that you  <br>
already know?<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;there is nothing meaningful without value. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Is everything that you understand of equal value to you? It certainly isn't <br>
with me.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We ignore what we do not value. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I wish that were true but the mental mechanism that extracts meaning is not <br>
always under conscious control and works even when we don't want it to. <br>
If you're trying to concentrate on something you think is important, it is <br>
not at all helpful to be near two people having a loud conversation about the <br>
relative merits of opening an egg at the big end as opposed to the small end.<br>
<p>
                     <br>
<i>        &gt;Its a natural part of our perceptual process. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Evolution realized that total concentration was not conducive to survival. <br>
If all of your brain power is being used to try to figure out the meaning of <br>
life, then you won't notice the saber toothed tiger lurking in the bushes. <br>
Conditions change however, inside my own home I'd be willing to take my <br>
chances with saber toothed tigers in exchange for total concentration.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If I do not value a noise in the room I am in, then it becomes         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ambient, attentuated, and I thus expend little to no energy on         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;percieving it. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Much more difficult if the noise is a language you understand. I have a <br>
recording of the sound of rain I sometimes use, the white noise masks more <br>
obtrusive noise, my mind knows it's the sound of rain and does not try to <br>
extract any more meaning out of it and let's me concentrate.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;our values create a continuum from good to bad, like to dislike. </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Yes, and our understanding of something also forms a continuum from zero to <br>
total, but the only relationship between the two is that if understanding <br>
is zero then value is zero.<br>
<p>
1)I understand that mass causes spacetime to curve. <br>
2)I understand that Bozo the clown has a red nose.<br>
<p>
My understanding of #2 is very deep and there is little if anything about it  <br>
that eludes me. My understanding of #1 is not as deep and there are things <br>
about it nobody comprehends, yet I value idea #1 far, far, more than #2.<br>
