An ideal spacesuit should be skin-tight and able to move effortlessly <br>
with the body. If it is made of a fabric that can change its area, as <br>
well as continue to maintain a particular "springiness", a suit made of <br>
it would <br>
be able to maintain a one-atmosphere pressure against the wearer's skin <br>
even as she moves around. The inside surface of this second skin can <br>
have a second circulatory system embedded in it to supply oxygen and <br>
carry away <br>
sweat from the underlying skin.<br>
    One way of making such a suit  is with something I call "Active <br>
Fabric", a material that can change its area. This stuff is made up of <br>
layers of plates in shapes that tile the plane [Penrose], such as <br>
squares, rectang<br>
les or hexagons (Figure). Two or more layers of these tiles are offset <br>
from each other by half the width of the tile. For human bodies, these <br>
plates can be quite large by nanotech standards, from a few microns to <br>
perhaps <br>
a millimeter across, and made of either diamondoid (carbon or silicon), <br>
ceramics, or possibly even metal. The layers of plates are connected <br>
together by sliding joints similar to my XY Active Cell interface <br>
[Bishop]. For <br>
square plates for example, the movement is at 45 degrees to the edge of <br>
the plate. This allows, (without considering a cascade of plates) an <br>
areal variation of something less than 400%, much more than is really <br>
needed for<br>
 the spacesuit proper.<br>
   To move two layered plates apart, a rack-and-pinion might work <br>
[Globus, Drexler], or a comb of linear molecules with "beads" on them <br>
that can take up various positions along the molecule [REF]. This also <br>
is what provid<br>
es the two-dimensional compressive strength of the fabric. Buckling is <br>
prevented by the pressure of the enclosed body.<br>
   To bring the sets of plates together, a network of fibers is <br>
attached to some of the inside layer of plates. At one end of a fiber <br>
might be a nanoscale winch, driven by a tiny motor, or something like <br>
the molecule that<br>
 the {bacterium harpoon from Foresight gathering}assembles and <br>
disassembles on the fly [REF]. These fibers also only need to extend <br>
for twice their length, so some molecule that does this with suitable <br>
chemical or electri<br>
cal prompting might make a clean solution, akin to muscle fiber <br>
contraction [actin REF]. Another possibility is so-called 'memory <br>
metal", or Nitinol, which can be made to contract when it is cooled.<br>
   With this basic core of the fabric, different flexiblelayers can be <br>
laminated on either side, for other purposes than simple vaccum <br>
environmental support. The layer against the skin of the wearer can <br>
contain embedded s<br>
ensors for pressure, temperature, water, chemicals, and so on, to help <br>
make things comfortable. An active gas circulatory system might <br>
maintain a very thin nitrogen/oxygen gas layer between the skin and the <br>
suit, tricking<br>
 the natural sensors of the living skin into thinking they are in free <br>
air (nude). This only works on shaved areas. Variable reflectivity <br>
layers can help with temperature control, as can the circulatory <br>
system.<br>
     The exterior layers can be almost anything. For harsh chemical <br>
environments, a teflon or neoprene coating  could be used, much like <br>
what is already available. For more general use, one would probably <br>
want an active o<br>
ptical surface of some kind, perhaps Phased Array Optics [Wouk] to <br>
generate three dimensional displays. This kind of display, along with <br>
optical sensors and digital signal prossors (DSPs) can form the basis <br>
of a "cloaking<br>
 device", or invisibility suit similar to the one the alien wore in the <br>
film "Predator". A TFT-style flexible membrane like on a laptop can <br>
display clothes, pictures, or movies for more sociable occasions.<br>
