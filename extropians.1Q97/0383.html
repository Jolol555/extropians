Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i>&gt;To anyone who denigrates any kind of evaluation, be it IQ, SAT, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;Football touchdowns, what have you, I say: Those who say it isn't worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;diddly do so because they didn't do diddly in that field of competition.</i><br>
<p>
Let's take this out of the realm of personal opinion and into <br>
methodology, shall we?  (and let's assume that everyone on this list <br>
had extraordinarily high SAT scores, I don't see any need to throw <br>
numbers at each other.)  From a methodological standpoint, any test <br>
claiming to measure an innate ability should be administered on a <br>
one-time, non-prepared basis.  And yet, those who take standardized <br>
tests more than once usually measure a significant upward score <br>
differential.  That is precisely WHY the Princeton Review makes <br>
bucketloads of money preparing students to take standardized tests, <br>
and why their methods work--they teach that you have to approach each <br>
test as a game of sorts, not a measure of inner ability.<br>
