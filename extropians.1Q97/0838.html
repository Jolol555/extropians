Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When argumentation was done face-to-face, a thoughless word might provoke</i><br>
<i>&gt;a fist to the nose, so restraint was practical.  Why should that apply</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the Internet?  Why should we not instead develop an ethic based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;tolerance on the receiving end?  </i><br>
<p>
Because I perceive a vast difference between vigorous debate and the<br>
deliberate neglect of basic civil codes.  Advanced debaters are quite <br>
capable of making their points without stooping to insult, rudeness, <br>
or thoughtless maligning of their conversation partners.  The word <br>
'thoughtless' itself indicates that one is not utilizing one's brain <br>
to find the most effective method of conveying an argument.<br>
<p>
I have also noticed in the course of my work that in most situations <br>
where the speaker makes statements to the effect that the listener <br>
should 'learn to develop a thicker skin', etc., the person on the <br>
receiving end usually hears something that quite legitimately stirs <br>
anger.  Simply demanding that people develop a greater tolerance for <br>
what they perceive as ill treatment does nothing to promote a better <br>
world, nor does it address the underlying problems.<br>
<p>
Someday we may not have to deal with emotions at all, but at the <br>
present time they serve as valuable signals as to whether a person <br>
perceives a threat, is being overstimulated by the environment, or is <br>
simply not in a state of good health.  I say we utilize that <br>
information to every positive end.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
