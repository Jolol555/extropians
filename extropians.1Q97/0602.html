<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; There's only one thing I know FOR SURE about genius, and that is: you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; don't become one by talking, discussing, or thinking about being one. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  On the contrary, talking and thinking about it is far more likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  determine its nature and guide us to creating the effect than is blindly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dismissing reason in favor of mystical revelation, regardless how "sure"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you may feel about such revelations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is way off track:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am never in favor of mystical revelation, or blindness of any type, and if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you thought i was suggesting anything of the sort, I apologize for being</i><br>
<i>&gt; unclear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly the opposite, I am suggesting lots of hard work,  and producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; something of substance, rather than chatting endlessly about who is entitled.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Pardon my misinterpretation, but it is a common--and dangerous--idea<br>
that /speakers/ should practice restraint lest they offend.  Tolerance<br>
is the obligation of listeners, not speakers.  Facts such as de Garis<br>
brings up--that SAT scores overwhelmingly favor males, are just facts,<br>
and inherently good things.  How they are interpreted is another matter,<br>
and free and open discussion is the best method for resolving whether<br>
they represent some inherent quality of malehood or just test bias and<br>
cultural influences.<br>
<p>
Even if De Garis's interpretations are hideous, his facts are still<br>
facts--"things of substance".   They must be dealt with as such.  The<br>
proper interpretation of those facts is more likely to come up in an<br>
environment of unrestrained discourse.<br>
