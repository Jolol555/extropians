<i>&gt; I'm not convinced that extropian ethics can really lead to results</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are at all compatible with modern-day environmentalism.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed!  I'm talking about rational respect for biodiversity and the<br>
cleanliness of one's environment.  I see "modern environmentalism"<br>
as a cult of self-loathing luddites with arbitrary values.  I'll<br>
have to think of a word to fight the e-word with, but I don't see<br>
any at the moment.  Perhaps "conservationist" is better, but that<br>
has anti-futurist overtones too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First there is the issue I raised earlier, that the diversity produced</i><br>
<i>&gt; by nature may pale in comparison to what we will have in a few decades.</i><br>
<p>
That may be true.  I'm not ready to count on that just yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am also unconvinced by the argument that studying nature will shed</i><br>
<i>&gt; light on our competitors and teach us more about our own evolution so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we can survive better.  The only significant competitors we will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have are other people.</i><br>
<p>
A species doesn't have to be a competitor or ancestor to teach us about<br>
ourselves.  Surveys of other species are the primary data that support<br>
and refute competing theories of evolution to which we are subject, so<br>
every species plays a part in those theories.  My sexual drives were<br>
formed by the same process as those that formed monogamous gorillas,<br>
promisquous bonobos, polygamous sage grouse, stepchild-murdering lions,<br>
and even social ants and bees.  Without all of them to study, I would<br>
not have had as much data with which to test my theories.  We evolve at<br>
the glacial pace of one generation every 12-20 years or so.  Insects<br>
and bacteria outpace us by orders of magnitude, so studying them is<br>
quite valuable.<br>
<p>
I don't think we are anywhere near enough to understanding the workings<br>
of our minds that we can afford to endanger the richest source of data<br>
available for that study.  Perhaps when the first computer wakes up and<br>
argues with me, I'll change that opinion, but you'll have to show me<br>
pretty convincingly.<br>
