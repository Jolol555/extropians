Depends on whether you live in it or outside it. :-)<br>
<p>
Most likely it would be smaller than the universe; there is only so much <br>
space in a manageable block of molecular devices, even if you use clever <br>
data compression. But I believe there would be more than enough power in <br>
a one cubic meter system to simulate at least a fairly complex planet in <br>
very high detail. <br>
<p>
(I envy the uploads in Permutation City; they could make a computing <br>
universe as large as they wanted)<br>
