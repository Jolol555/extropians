I agree with this statement when applied to general art, but there is <br>
a particular class of artworks that serve a definitive purpose, and <br>
that purpose is usually clearly understood among the target audience. <br>
My preferred genre of poetry has a long history of serving political <br>
and satirical purposes, especially among populaces that are <br>
non-literate.  Oral poetry is often utilized for the purpose of <br>
chronicalling history, as in the Viking and Greek sagas.  The verse <br>
that we now think of as nonsensical nursery rhymes was carefully <br>
crafted to satirize events of the time in order that those vocalizing <br>
such opinions could escape jail.  More recently, during Yeats' time, the <br>
practice of 'rat-rhyming' served to harshly criticize those in authority <br>
in Ireland under the guise of entertaining for one's supper--and yet the <br>
target audience quite well understood the intention.  During our own <br>
slave era in the U.S., poetry served as a direct means of communication <br>
between separated kinsmen.  In South America, many poets have been <br>
jailed and tortured because their poetry serves as a thinly-veiled <br>
call for revolution, (again well understood by the populace) as <br>
documented by Amnesty International.  Really, among world nations the <br>
United States is one of the few that holds no such role for its <br>
poets, preferring to maintain them in the realm of pure expression.<br>
<p>
I particularly love Yeats' blistering invective directed toward his own <br>
countrymen after Parnell's defeat:<br>
<p>
	Come, fix upon me that accusing eye.<br>
	I thirst for accusation.  All that was sung<br>
	All that was said in Ireland is a lie.	<br>
	Bred out of the contagion of the throng<br>
	Saving the rhyme rats hear before they die.<br>
	Leave nothing but the nothings that belong<br>
	To this bare soul, let all men judge that can<br>
	Whether it be an animal or a man.<br>
<p>

Gregory Houston, in re my objections to his definition of art:<br>
<i>&gt;The fact that you do not subscribe to it does not make it any less </i><br>
<i>&gt;real </i><br>
<p>
Actually, my main objection stemmed from your seeming insistence that <br>
this was the only definition of art in existence.  <br>
