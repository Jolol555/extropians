<i>        &gt;Knowing the what the hardware looks like might help us deduce the         </i><br>

<p>
That's because we usually only have a picture of a very thin cross section <br>
of a cell, if you could see the entire cell in 3D things would be different, <br>
even if the resolution was no greater that found in a good visible light <br>
microscope. The new popular visible light confocal microscope certainly helps <br>
with this depth of focus problem, I was surprised when I learned it was<br>
invented by the versatile Marvin Minsky, better known as the father of  <br>
artificial intelligence, he not only thought up the idea he actually built <br>
the first one.<br>

<i>        &gt;using optical information?      </i><br>
   <br>
<p>
I'll bet you could tell if a synapse had undergone LTP or not, you probably  <br>
could not tell how it was using neurotransmitters, but maybe we'd get lucky <br>
and find there is a gross physical change.<br>

Yes, that would be much better and I know that would work, but I was hoping <br>
something could be found before we had Nanotechnology.<br>

Is my copy of Windows NT not the same as the "original" at Microsoft  <br>
headquarters? If I have not convinced you that I am correct it's because the <br>
post you're looking at is not as good as the "original" on my computer.<br>

<i>        &gt;Visible light doesn't have the resolution needed; under ideal         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;conditions in a microscope, the best you can do is about 200        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nanometers.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
If you had 200 nanometer resolution in 3D you could certainly tell what  <br>
synapse went where, whether you could obtain enough other information about <br>
it for an upload I'm not sure.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This is an order of magnitude too poor. </i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
If so then you'd need light with a wavelength of 40 nanometers, that's in the <br>
Ultraviolet region not in the X ray, and I think that's an improvement. <br>
Actually there is a way to resolve very small objects even with very large <br>
waves.<br>
<p>
More than 100 years ago Ernst Abbe "proved" that details smaller than half <br>
the wavelength of the light used to illuminate a specimen could not be <br>
resolved, but he made a hidden assumption, namely that the distance between <br>
the specimen and the source of light was large compared to the wavelength. <br>
In 1956 J.A. O'Keefe proposed a "scanning near field microscope" that would <br>
break the Abbe barrier. O'Keefe said that if light was emitted from a tiny <br>
hole less than a wavelength away from the specimen then the resolution would <br>
be limited only by the size of the hole, the wavelength of the light would be<br>
irrelevant. In 1972 Eric Ash proved experimentally that O'Keefe was correct.              <br>
It looks like this technique may be practical for some things. In 1993 <br>
Eric Betzig of ATT used visible light from a laser 10 nanometers above a <br>
sample to reveal details of the skeletal scaffolding inside a cell as small <br>
as 15 nanometers. Visible light is about 500 nm.<br>
<p>
I don't know how you could use this technique for 3D brain scanning, that's <br>
why I mentioned it, I need some help, put your thinking cap on people.<br>
