<p>
Agreed. The writing of software has educational value. Looked should be at<br>
activities that both have educational value, and take place outside of the<br>
school environment. In order to increase a more realistic world view and<br>
promote individualism (vs group mentality) early on. <br>
<p>
Maybe this is best done, by having an individual experience a lot of<br>
different 'groups' troughout her/his educational process. Computer and<br>
internet technology also show interesting possibilities for this. <br>
<p>
For auto-finances i also considered a merging of schools with public<br>
libraries and commercial re-education facilities. Though this would surely<br>
work early on, because of the already present knowledge, it would probably<br>
not last long in a free market situation if implemented without an extra<br>
income.<br>
<p>
Does anyone have suggestions for good books on education reform ? <br>
(based on promoting individuality, curiosity, realistic world view)<br>
