After a carefully crafted and rational argument by Greg Burch to <br>
Gregory Houston about the need for a "new synthesis" between <br>
inward-looking visionaries and outward-looking scientists, I ranted <br>
about Gregory Houston's implied solipsism and false sense of <br>
separation between subjective and objective sciences.<br>
<p>
After Gregory Houston's response, I wrote to him privately and said<br>
&lt;I realize it was unfair to accuse you of solipsism when it really <br>
appears that you're primarily interested in emotive education. (To <br>
tell the truth, I was probably using your post more as an opportunity <br>
to rant against Claude de Contrecoeur's anti-materialist philosophy <br>
than anything that you specifically proposed.)&gt;<br>
<p>
I also admited to being ignorant as to what "an evolving curriculum of <br>
emotive education" might involve.<br>
<p>
I did an AltaVista search on "emotive education" and was surprised at <br>
the two URLs (other than book ads) that popped to the top.  Both <br>
seemed to be surprisingly extropian references and might just be <br>
useful for a new sort of basic academic curriculum.<br>
<p>
The first URL was <a href="http://www.iret.org/essays/teorebta.html">http://www.iret.org/essays/teorebta.html</a><br>
a brief essay called "The Essence of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy <br>
(REBT)" by Albert Ellis, Ph.D., which contained a concise listing of <br>
"12 Irrational Ideas That Cause and Sustain Neurosis" and <br>
corresponding rational ideas to counteract them that could, IMO, be <br>
used as a basis for Extropian psychological principles.<br>
<p>
The second URL pointed to the Web site of Peter Small and his <br>
interesting take on the philosophy of object-oriented programming and <br>
the design of software brains along with some unpublished chapters on <br>
"emotive decision making" from his book LINGO SORCERY.  See the <br>
following URL for a site map:<br>
<a href="http://codwar.netmare.co.uk/Silicon_Grove/petersmall/siteMap.html#ancho">http://codwar.netmare.co.uk/Silicon_Grove/petersmall/siteMap.html#ancho</a>  <br>
r1796955<br>
<p>
Particularly interesting in the context of this thread was Peter <br>
Small's CD-ROM called "How God Makes God" (see <br>
<a href="http://codwar.netmare.co.uk/Silicon_Grove/petersmall/HomePge.html">http://codwar.netmare.co.uk/Silicon_Grove/petersmall/HomePge.html</a>) <br>
from which I quote:<br>
&lt;"How God Makes God" is a thought provoking CD-ROM which provides an <br>
unique explanation of human life in terms of probability, game theory <br>
and computer concepts.  [Snip] The conclusion of "How God Makes God" <br>
is that the human race is now on the verge of creating machines with <br>
virtual brains which might one day provide mankind with a route to <br>
unlimited expansion and evolution in the universe.&gt;<br>
<p>
My take on Ellis's REBT principles is that we should basically view <br>
ourselves as intelligent, responsible, self-owned agents who, <br>
nevertheless, have to fit into a ecological / economic environment <br>
over which we shall never have full control.  Though I have not <br>
checked it out, it seems to me that Peter Small's "How God Makes God" <br>
CD-ROM, describing the systematic principles underlying the <br>
spontaneous order we have to survive in, along with Ellis's REBT <br>
principles for self-ownership, might indeed be a good foundation for a <br>
basic rational-emotive education curriculum.<br>
