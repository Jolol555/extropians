<p>
How about just chucking rocks to ward off *other* scavengers?  <br>
<p>
In addition to the proper body structure, using spears also requires time, <br>
energy and brains to make them. Even if early hominids were smart enough <br>
to make spears, it would not make sense to expend the needed resources <br>
unless their brains could do the calculations you describe below in order <br>
to make enough kills to pay for the investment in fashioning a weapon.  <br>
<p>
I've not read much about scavenger hypotheses, but the follwing scenario <br>
could serve as an evolutionary bootstrapping event to make the advance <br>
from scavenger to hunter.  Killing an animal with a <br>
projectile requires considerable skill because the hit must be forceful <br>
and direct, but to scare an animal you only need to get close.  I can <br>
see a band of hominids with raw rocks and sticks laying claim to a more <br>
skilled hunters prey.  Once in a while, one or a few good hits while <br>
repelling a carnivor or other scavengers would result in a kill.  The <br>
benefit of killing ones own meal instead of waiting for someone to do it <br>
for you have already been stated.  Once the brain was wired for accurate <br>
throwing, time invested in more deadly projectiles would pay off.<br>
<p>
Also, the scavenging scenario could explain selction for group cohesion. <br>
Note that many scavengers as well as hunters of the African plains feed <br>
in groups.  I can't think of a good estimate of how many 3-4 feet tall <br>
bipeds could shoo a self respecting savanah dining party, but they would <br>
definatly need a plan and communication system, however crude.<br>
   <br>
IMO, what I've said falls right in line with the rest of your post.<br>

<i>&gt; This is a fine example of technology effecting evolution. Due to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational demands of intuitive trajectory calculation, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication demands of hunting in teams or packs, lager brain cases</i><br>
<i>&gt; were seen as an evolutionary advantage. WHile the analytical abilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; of hunting were amplified in males, the females who had to look after</i><br>
<i>&gt; offspring had to coordinate defenses against predators whil the males</i><br>
<i>&gt; were hunting, so they developed better communication skills.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Want to prove this is so? Try to teach a chimp to throw a 90 mph</i><br>
<i>&gt; fastball on a major league field in the strikezone. It'll never happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He doesn't have the hips for the job.</i><br>
