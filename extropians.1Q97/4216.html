<p>
True, I have shown no evidence. And you have shown no evidence of your<br>
"preposterous" claim that computers can experience emotions. I can only<br>
show that there are no computers today which experience emotions. You<br>
cannot show me a single computer that does experience emotions. I have<br>
merely shown reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple thought experiment should suffice to show your mistake: Other</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals clearly have emotional states.  Fear, lust, hunger, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences are not unique to Homo Sapiens.  But our machinery is</i><br>
<i>&gt; different.</i><br>
<p>
The machinery is different, but the machinery/hardware is still capable<br>
of experiencing emotions. Computers today are not. We have a great deal<br>
more in common with mammals than we do computers.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if we postulate that one must evolve a more complex brain than</i><br>
<i>&gt; those other creatures to have emotional states similar to ours, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; clear that the emotional states are felt in /whatever hardware/ is</i><br>
<i>&gt; available to feel them.</i><br>
<p>
Whoa! I never said anything about requiring more complex brains to feel<br>
emotions ... I said that appropriate brain/hardware is necessary. As a<br>
matter of fact I believe the simplest of mammal brains can experience<br>
emotions, though the most complex of computers cannot. There are<br>
probably an infinite number of hardware designs with the potential to<br>
feel emotions, but the computer is not yet one of them.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It is palpable nonsense to say that because</i><br>
<i>&gt; my mouth is dry when I feel fear, that fear therefore requires a mouth</i><br>
<i>&gt; and salivary glands.</i><br>
<p>
No, but they need some way to feel it, and IMHO the more things to feel<br>
with the better as far as I am concerned. If they cannot feel it then it<br>
is not an emotion, it is merely an abstract thought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Fear /is/ the cognitive state associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt; those bodily reactions, or whatever the reactions to it are in another</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of body with different inputs and outputs.</i><br>
<p>
Artificial Emotion Program:<br>
<p>
  IF x occurs THEN run fear subroutine<br>
<p>
  fear subroutine:<br>
      PLAY scream.wav audio file<br>
      DISPLAY ominous.jpg image file <br>
 <br>
Is that an emotion!?! When exactly did the computer feel an emotion? The<br>
computer is processing its data and x occurs. But it did not feel x, it<br>
merely recognizes x in a very detached manner. The computer then runs<br>
the fear subroutine. The computer "appears" to be displaying an emotion,<br>
but it never felt one. And it does not feel itself playing the sound<br>
file or displaying the image. It merely does it without feeling. Perhaps<br>
you would like to rewrite my hypothetical program above to show me how<br>
theoretically you believe a computer could experience emotions without<br>
hardware for experiencing sensations. Anyone? Please, this would be most<br>
enlightening. You might even recieve the Nobel Prize.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They won't feel fear in exactly the way I do, but then neither do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you or anyone else.  That doesn't mean you don't feel fear at all.</i><br>
<p>
They won't feel it if you don't give them something to feel with. What<br>
part of your computer has the ability to feel? Exactly which part(s) can<br>
feel?<br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Who decides what hardware is "proper" for experiencing fear?  It obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't require arms or legs; a paraplegic can feel it.  It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; require sight or hearing or smell or touch; those whithout those inputs</i><br>
<i>&gt; can still fear.  Don't patients with artificial hearts feel fear?  Those</i><br>
<i>&gt; breathing with a respirator?  Those on dialysis?  As should be obvious</i><br>
<i>&gt; by this reduction, the only organ needed to experience fear is a brain,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and whatever inputs to it one happens to have available.</i><br>
<p>
Only one thing is required, humans and other mammals tend to have a<br>
great number of physical organs to feel with. Computers have zero.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Please give me evidence of this.  Why is my assumption that a computer's</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognition  /does/ include states analagous to our emotions have any</i><br>
<i>&gt; less weight than your assumption that they don't?  I refuse to be so</i><br>
<i>&gt; anthropocentric without reason.  We are not unique.</i><br>
<p>
Because emotion is not simply a cognitive thing. Take the physical<br>
aspect away from emotion, and there is no emotion, there is only<br>
cognition, thought. Cognition can influence emotion, and emotion can<br>
influence cognition, but they are not the same thing. The primitive<br>
cognition of the limbic system can influence emotions in less evolved<br>
animals, and the emotions of less evolved animals can influence the<br>
cognition taking place in their limbic systems. But both things are<br>
required, an appropriate program and appropriate hardware.<br>
<p>
Your statement that any hardware will do is just as ludicrous as saying<br>
any program will do. <br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
