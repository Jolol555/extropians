You acted then as the "optical" or seeing hardware. Sort of like a<br>
seeing eye dog. You acted as the computer's vehicle for viewing the<br>
world. Instead of a camera anylysing a space and rendering it in a<br>
computer, you analyzed the space and rendered it into the computer.<br>

It is a real physical apparatus. It is not artificial in the sense that<br>
I was using artificial. I was using artificial (and perhaps<br>
inapproriately) as the opposite of real. It is not an artificial<br>
computer abstraction of a heart without physical embodiment. Only a<br>
physical "artificial" heart could replace a physical biological heart.<br>
We could not remove the person's heart and then program that person to<br>
think in a different way so that they would not die with the removal of<br>
their heart. The physicality of the artificial heart is not artificial.<br>
You have replaced a physical thing with a physical thing. What we are<br>
debating is the ability to replace physically felt emotions with<br>
something not physical, something purely abstract. There probably are<br>
physical things that can be replaced by abstractions, but not all<br>
physical things can be replaced by abstractions. Emotions cannot.   <br>
<p>
No one has shown me any evidence that a computer has the ability to feel<br>
emotive sensation, and I do not believe our discussion is progressing in<br>
that direction. Thus at this point, at least for the time being, I<br>
propose that we agree to disagree.<br>

Explore and play!<br>
