PLEASE NOTE:  By the time you tan, it's too late.  See references below<br>
<p>
Skin sensitivity to sunlight is controlled by the genetic ability of an<br>
individual to produce melanin....<br>
(<a href="http://cric.chemres.hu/POL/ASP_Home/asp_bro2.html">http://cric.chemres.hu/POL/ASP_Home/asp_bro2.html</a>)<br>
<p>
The average white skin can only produce melanin for 15 minutes a day (New<br>
South Whales Cancer Council, 1987).<br>
<p>
Skin cancer is usually a disease of white-skinned people. If your skin is<br>
naturally brown or black you have some built-in sun protection and risk of<br>
skin cancer is lower. (<a href="http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/85.htm">http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/85.htm</a>)<br>
<p>
The lighter your skin colour, the less melanin your skin can make... and<br>
the easier it can be damaged by UV rays.<br>
(<a href="http://www.mb.doe.ca/ENGLISH/AIR/HLWS/health1/skin2.html">http://www.mb.doe.ca/ENGLISH/AIR/HLWS/health1/skin2.html</a>)<br>
<p>
...it takes several days for the body to produce this extra melanin.<br>
(<a href="http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/85.htm">http://www.rushmoor.gov.uk/85.htm</a>)<br>
<p>
In some senses, suntans are "protective," but contrary to most people's<br>
belief, they do not prevent sun induced skin damage....<br>
A suntan is your bodies protective response to a harmful environmental<br>
stimulus. When you have a tan, you have exposed yourself to lots of harmful<br>
sun rays. (<a href="http://healthed2.shs.vt.edu/sun.html">http://healthed2.shs.vt.edu/sun.html</a>)<br>
<p>
There is no such thing as a healthy tan: a suntan, not to mention a<br>
sunburn, is an indicator of skin damaged by the sun. A suntan results from<br>
the pigmentation change of melanin, the body's reaction as it tries to<br>
protect itself from further sun damage.<br>
(<a href="http://www.pluggedin.org/info/info.html">http://www.pluggedin.org/info/info.html</a>).<br>
<p>
Staying in the shade will not prevent skin damage; the UVA and UVB rays<br>
reflect off sand, snow, water, roads, and buildings and UV rays penetrate<br>
clouds and "haze".  (ibid.)<br>
<p>
Even tanning slowly and carefully is dangerous. Darrell Rigel, M.D.,<br>
clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University,<br>
Manhattan, maintains, "There's no such thing as a safe tan. That's the<br>
key point. You have to think about why you tan. The body senses that it<br>
is being injured by UV radiation and, to protect itself, it produces<br>
melanin." (<a href="http://freenet.uchsc.edu/2000/prevent/cancer/suntan/skin.html">http://freenet.uchsc.edu/2000/prevent/cancer/suntan/skin.html</a>)<br>
<p>
The upshot:  I'd suggest that unless you have a clinical vitamin D<br>
deficiency you get enough sun.  I ran by a couple of ads for melanin-<br>
based sunblock as I looked for these references.  It occurs to me that<br>
using early genetic engineering it may be that increasing melanin in<br>
the skin is easier than repairing/replacing damaged cells constantly.<br>
During the time between then and full-scale nanotech/uploading, dark<br>
skin may become quite fashionable as a longevity treatment.  I think<br>
that at that point a fair measure of a person's IQ (irony quotient)<br>
could be how loud and long they laugh at that prospect.<br>
