For those of us who listen to e-mail with speech synth, it is easier to have<br>
the new comments before the quotes. If the new material is at the end, I can<br>
go to the end, and search back for the last &gt;. Except for those posters who<br>
have a &gt; in there sig file.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks.<br>

The worst enemy of those who now or will need medical care is the politician <br>
who proscribes what doctors are allowed to prescribe and research,<br>
.with their patients permission,<br>
<p>
Those who understand this are strongly encouraged to modify this to <br>
fit their personality, and add this to their signature file, and<br>
organize to recover our freedom from Big Brother.<br>
<p>
For those who wait until they are sick, it will be too late.<br>
<p>
Those who suffer from diseases which might have been cured by fetal tissue <br>
research or schedule 1 drugs banned by Big Brother have the right to<br>
hold those accountable who sat on their hands while they remained ill.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Long healthy life.<br>
