Erik Moeller wrote (according to JKC)<br>
	I only see one motivation that drives all Libertarians. It's not<br>
	the desire for  freedom or the desire for justice. It's pure greed.<br>
<p>
If greed is the desire for unearned wealth, libertarianism won't serve it.<br>
[Whose definition is that?]<br>
<p>
If by "greed" you mean self-interest, do you deny that self-interest<br>
motivates you?  I assume that most people are similar enough to me<br>
that if libertarianism is good for me, it's good for them.<br>
<p>
	Oh yeah, and in some cases it's  stupidity.<br>
<p>
Then a libertarian constitution is no threat, since all the *smart* folks<br>
will join voluntary socialist organizations (we won't stop you).<br>
