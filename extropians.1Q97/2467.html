Nice post, but I feel I have to correct you a little on this one point. <br>
The illusion Buddhists overcome is the illusion of *intrinsic* meaning<br>
and value, not meaning and value as such.  <br>
<p>
In other words, the cause of suffering, according to Buddhism, is our<br>
habitual reification of meaning and value as inherent in the object<br>
(self or other) in itself.<br>
<p>
Buddhist philosophers have through the centuries striven to make this<br>
distinction clear.  To see meaning and value as illusory in *every* sense<br>
would be nihilism, which is the opposite extreme to reification (which<br>
they call eternalism), but Buddhism is notoriously the 'Middle Way'.<br>
