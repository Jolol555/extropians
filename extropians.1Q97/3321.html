For a rich technomad running a business over the Net, emigration is merely<br>
a matter of getting on a plane to another country. While I was travelling<br>
around the world last year few people noticed that I was in a different<br>
country every few weeks and several people offered me contract work<br>
(sadly, horrid Windows programming) over the Net. As communications<br>
technology improves location becomes increasingly irrelevant for business,<br>
and people will have a strong incentive to, say, work for an American<br>
company for American salaries but live in Thailand.<br>
<p>
If most business can be moved online, then we enter a situation where<br>
countries will become the kind of proprietary communities I was talking<br>
about earlier, vying with each other to attract the most successful<br>
technomads in return for their taxes. This may be one important route<br>
towards the kind of societies we talk about, and is probably one important<br>
reason why governments are trying hard to screw up the Net. <br>
