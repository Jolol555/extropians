I wrote the following summary about Prigogine's book: _From Being to<br>
Becoming_ four years ago for the Extropy email list. When a chemistry<br>
friend told me today that she was reading one of Prigogine's other<br>
books, I dug out this text from my old archives for her. I'm posting it<br>
here (again) in case anyone has an interest in Prigogine's work.<br>
<p>
I have had an interest in Prigogine's work for seven or eight years. In<br>
the Fall of 1992, the Bay Area Reading and Discussion Group discussed<br>
_From Being to Becoming_. I wrote this book overview and summary of that<br>
meeting afterwards for the Extropy email list. It is *by no means*<br>
complete, these are only the parts that were interesting to me, and that<br>
I remembered the most.<br>
<p>
This particular meeting of the Bay Area Reading and Discussion Group<br>
(BARDG) 13 November 1992 was an extraodinary one because I asked my<br>
former thesis advisor, Alex Garcia, to talk with us. Alex worked with<br>
Prigogine as a graduate student, so he had some interesting perspectives<br>
on Prigogine and Prigogine's work.<br>
<p>
OK, so my four-yr-old text follows. Most of it is still relevant, I<br>
believe.<br>

My summary (and criticism) of the book.<br>
<p>
The theme of the book is that irreversibility is a fundamental property<br>
of physics. Prigogine proposes that entropy is an operator (operators<br>
map functions onto functions), and time is an operator. And that the<br>
time that we are all familiar with from classical mechanics is just an<br>
ensemble average of this operator with a state vector.<br>
<p>
Historical.<br>
<p>
Alex Garcia provided some great historical background to  Prigogine and<br>
his group. Garcia worked in Prigogine's group in Brussels, Belgium for<br>
two years (Garcia's specialty  is fluid dynamics and statistical<br>
mechanics), and then for another year at the University of Texas in<br>
Austin.  (Prigogine works for 2 months out of every year at UT.) This<br>
group is an eclectic group.  Their interests are far more diverse than<br>
those in the Santa Fe Institue. Prigogine's work focuses on nonlinear<br>
dynamics but they study: ants, chemical reactions, economics,<br>
statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum dynamics and the list<br>
goes on.<br>
<p>
Prigogine is primarily a chemist. He was well established in his field 20<br>
years ago, so what he's done since then, is branch out in related areas.<br>
As I  understand it, his main discovery has been the  existence of<br>
"chemical clocks." These are chemical reactions that oscillate in a very<br>
regular and precise way. Prigogine predicted  that they should exist<br>
from a theoretical chemistry standpoint several decades ago.  In<br>
the late 1950's, one of his research group came back from a visit with a<br>
colleague in Russia, announcing that they had a chemical reaction that<br>
did just what Prigogine predicted. The reaction is now known as the<br>
Belousov-Zhabotininskii reaction and it is the oxidation of citric acid<br>
by potassium bromate catalyzed by the  ceric-cerous ion couple. This<br>
researcher had the recipe for mixing it up in the lab, Prigogine's<br>
group re-created it, and Prigogine bought two cases of champagne for his<br>
group to celebrate.<br>
<p>
Some other stories and comments from Garcia.<br>
<p>
He said that if Prigogine's current theories are to be borne out, they<br>
will probably occur in the quantum mechanical realm. We wouldn't see<br>
them on a macroscopic scale.<br>
<p>
He answered a question one of us had on why Prigogine wasn't very well<br>
known (at least outside of his immediate field). The answer is that<br>
Prigogine is very bad about acknowledging work from others outside his<br>
research group. So others outside his research group don't acknowledge<br>
him very much!<br>
<p>
In far-from-equilibrium (FFE) statistical mechanics/thermodynamics,<br>
there is not a pressing need for new all-encompassing equations, even<br>
though the conditions there are so different from equilibrium<br>
situations.  Apparently researchers for years have been quite successful<br>
at applying the equilibrium equations (known as local thermodynamic<br>
equilibrium or LTE) *locally* to FFE regions and *bootstrapping* the<br>
results together.<br>
<p>
Literary.<br>
<p>
Prigogine's _From Being to Becoming_ is not particularly well-written, in<br>
that it doesn't flow well- the reader is taken on numerous side journeys<br>
that make it hard to tell what the real focus of the book is.<br>
<p>
In addition, the equations were a distraction. They provided proof to<br>
what was said in the text, (There were  exceptions, however.) but they<br>
were not necessary to understanding the points he made. However, if you<br>
are a scientist, and would like to work with these ideas some more, it's<br>
good to have the equations and the theoretical foundations presented. A<br>
couple of us brought Prigogine's _Order Out of Chaos_ and we learned<br>
that there is an almost one-to-one mapping between _From Being to<br>
Becoming_ and _Order Out of Chaos_. Apparently Prigogine took the<br>
equations out, kept most of the diagrams, and expanded on the concepts.<br>
Even though I'm only part way through that second book, I recommend<br>
_Order Out of Chaos_  far more than _From Being to Becoming_.<br>
<p>
Technical.<br>
<p>
The Prigogine talks about entropy alot, but nowhere does he clear give a<br>
physical description of entropy.<br>
<p>
<p>
Some interesting discussions/points we had.<br>
<p>
One of Prigigine's main foci is that nonlinear interactions frequently<br>
lead to order (which he calls "dissipative structures") through<br>
fluctuations. (Hayek has written alot about this from the economics<br>
side.) A dissipative structure is order visible on a macroscale which<br>
can exchange energy with the outside world.<br>
<p>
One result from an evolutionary standpoint:<br>
<p>
One of us talked about the profound effect that Prigogine's theories had<br>
on his world-view. This new world-view was that complex forms, such as<br>
ourselves, can arise in *local* fluctuations. So then each of us are<br>
*special*. It helped him view his life as much more *meaningful* than<br>
how he had considered it before. (This world-view is a bit different<br>
from the standard  deterministic view of our evolution,  which is that<br>
we are  all swept up and evolving together, and are the end results of<br>
regular process of life. I'm not saying that deterministic evolution is<br>
wrong, but only that you can look at it from a different perspective.)<br>
So  then we got off on a tangent on how this might be a good idea to<br>
spread- it may help people view their own lives as a similar  *special*<br>
occurrences, which, in turn, would help them be more aware,<br>
responsible,  want to live fuller lives, etc.<br>
<p>
One result from a nanotechnology standpoint:<br>
<p>
We talked about Prigogine's claim that fluctuations near the critical<br>
point have large amplitudes and extend over large distances. This, in<br>
turn, implies that perhaps there is hope for the nanotech community who<br>
wish to simulate a large number of nonlinear processes into a coherent<br>
whole ("us"). Then we got off on another tangent of uploading<br>
difficulties having to do with the different timescales of the different<br>
processes.<br>
<p>
We also talked some about entropy, but that has already been well<br>
covered on this list.<br>
