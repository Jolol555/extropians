From: Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Let's suppose you're in an airplane going one mile per second, around</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mach 5 or 6.  This is considerably faster than the Concorde.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; airplane is going around 1/186000 as fast as a ray of light.   Now v</i><br>
<i>&gt; over c is squared, so tau here is equal to 1 - 1/(186,000 * 186,000), or</i><br>
<i>&gt; around:</i><br>
<i>&gt; .99999999997 or (1 - 0.0000000000289051)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Somebody else says that you actually gain time due to General</i><br>
<i>&gt; Relativity, which says that time slows down close to a large mass [i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; speeds up in an airplane], but I can't calculate that.</i><br>
<p>
Actually the GR calculation is quite simple, at least approximately.<br>
Photons redshift as they climb out of a gravitational well because they<br>
lose energy.  This means the higher observer actually sees things running<br>
slower lower down, which is interpreted as time running faster for the<br>
higher observer.<br>
<p>
A photon of energy E has an effective gravitational mass of E/c^2, and<br>
gravitational potential energy over height h in constant gravity field g<br>
is m*g*h.  So, the photon climbing in the Earth's surface gravitational<br>
field of g = 9.8 m/s^2 will lose energy equal to (E/c^2) * g * h, or<br>
E * (g/c^2) * h.<br>
<p>
The fractional time change will be equal to the fractional energy<br>
loss, and that is just (g/c^2) * h.  g/c^2 is about 10^-14 using units<br>
of meters.  A commercial jet flying at 10000 m will therefore have a<br>
speedup due to GR of about 10^-10.  This is an order of magnitude more<br>
than the relativistic slowdown of even the mile per second plane, so<br>
it will swamp that effect in normal situations.  Remember to set your<br>
watch when you land.<br>
<p>
This is a rough calculation; I'm not sure that the photon mass equivalence<br>
can be plugged in directly in this way, but I think it is right to an<br>
order of magnitude.<br>
