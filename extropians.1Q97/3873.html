I don't understand.  It seems the two hands you describe provide the analogy<br>
with the flexibility you say it lacks.  The concept of 'escape velocity'<br>
seems to be analogous to 'internal individual forces' that could 'propell' a<br>
'partical' 'away' from a 'condensing mass.'  The concept of 'freedom'<br>
becomes possession of 'escape energy.'  One is forced to wonder about the<br>
concept of 'speed limit' and its correlation to sanity.<br>
