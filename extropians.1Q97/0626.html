THEME<br>
-----<br>
<p>
The phenomena of implicit cognition -- implicit memory, implicit<br>
learning, unconscious perception, blindsight, and so on -- have<br>
attracted widespread attention in recent years.  This is partly because<br>
of their intrinsic interest, and partly because the study of these<br>
processes holds great promise as an empirical method for investigating<br>
consciousness.  But although research in these areas has proliferated,<br>
the connections between this research and issues about consciousness<br>
have not yet been fully articulated.  What have we learned about the<br>
conscious mind from the study of implicit cognition?<br>
<p>
This conference is intended to address this question, drawing systematic<br>
connections between implicit cognition and consciousness. We welcome both<br>
empirical contributions, using experimental research to help understand the<br>
nature of conscious and unconscious processes, and theoretical<br>
contributions<br>
that analyze or integrate existing work.<br>
<p>
A non-exclusive list of the issues that will be explored include:<br>
implicit memory in normals and amnesics and its relation to<br>
consciousness; perception without awareness; blindsight; perception of<br>
unattended material; non-conscious thought; neural correlates of<br>
conscious and unconscious processes; criteria for the ascription of<br>
consciousness; the function of consciousness; and the capacities and<br>
limitations of unconscious processing. It is intended that these topics<br>
will be covered in an interdisciplinary manner and towards this end<br>
speakers are invited to discuss these issues from philosophical,<br>
psychological and/or physiological perspectives.<br>
