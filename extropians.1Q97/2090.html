Richard Brodie:<br>
<i>&gt; This space-shifting on the fly is what I refer to as "Level 3" of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Learning Pyramid in my book VIRUS OF THE MIND. We've been discussing it</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Church of Virus list on and off for the past year.</i><br>
<p>
I am now wondering whether this technique similar to or different from <br>
a technique used by persons in interdisciplinary fields who utilize <br>
research from various systems of research.  It's difficult for me to <br>
describe, but when one is drawing together research from various <br>
fields, there is a sort of mental juggling act wherein one must <br>
evaluate each piece of research within the context and the methodology <br>
under which it was conducted, and simultaneously bring those pieces <br>
together into a coherent connecting concept.  Maybe I am describing <br>
parallel processing, because there is a sensation of shifting back <br>
and forth between two tracks of thought, but conceptually I tend to<br>
view it as a fractal construction.<br>
<p>
Yes, no, maybe?<br>
