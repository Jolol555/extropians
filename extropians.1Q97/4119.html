Subject: w00f: Worth reading...<br>
<p>
This article is light background on Cults using the WWW. It's worth <br>
reading and includes more info on the weirdos who recently killed <br>
themselves. I've discovered that I have a videotape they sent me a couple <br>
years ago when they called themselves Total Overcomers Anonymous. I must <br>
say that the video is either the product of a disturbed mind or a very <br>
stupid joke. It's called "Beyond Human - The Last Call." If anyone's <br>
interested I'll type in the text on the front and back of the case for <br>
you. Anyway, here's the article:<br>
<p>
Cybercults earn money, recruit on Web<br>
<p>
It was advertised as a meeting on "UFOs, SPACE ALIENS, and their final <br>
fight for Earth's Spoils." <br>
<p>
But many of 30 young people crowded into the suburban Birmingham, Ala., <br>
library meeting room on April 9, 1994, were<br>
disappointed. <br>
<p>
The speakers quickly veered away from ET and into a New Age mix of <br>
reincarnation, spiritual evolution and a Gospel where<br>
Jesus was "the Captain" and God was "the Chief of Chiefs." <br>
<p>
Still, the three women and one man, pleasant and neatly dressed, made an <br>
impression on a few teen-agers. <br>
<p>
"They said, 'You may feel this speaks to you or rings a bell with you. <br>
This probably means you are one of these people waiting<br>
to go to the next level,' " recalls Bob Waldrep of the Watchman <br>
Fellowship, a Christian ministry that tracks cults. <br>
<p>
Waldrep remembers two or three teens staying to talk with the speakers. <br>
He also remembers a chilling part of their talk. <br>
<p>
"They said to step out of the human kingdom to the next level you have to <br>
put away everything, family, possessions -<br>
everything," Waldrep says. <br>
<p>
Almost exactly four years later, 39 members of the same cult did give up <br>
everything, committing a mass suicide that their<br>
Internet Web site said would allow their souls to be scooped up by a <br>
spacecraft trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. <br>
<p>
The deaths apparently end the odyssey of the little-known group that <br>
started as a desert commune in the 1970s and evolved<br>
into a cybertech cult whose bodies were found near banks of computers in <br>
a posh mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. <br>
<p>
It is this evolution that troubles cult watchers. <br>
<p>
The group used the World Wide Web for both its business, called Higher <br>
Source, and its Web page, Heaven's Gate, which<br>
was used to snag new recruits. It used buzzwords designed to catch <br>
browsers whose interest ranged from UFOs and<br>
conspiracies to the spiritual and religious. <br>
<p>
The Rancho Santa Fe group is not the only cult in cyberspace. <br>
<p>
"Cults are using the Internet for a number of different purposes - to <br>
recruit, to support themselves, and as apologists," says<br>
John Knapp, executive director of trancenet.org a Burke, N.Y. group that <br>
follows exploitative psychological techniques that<br>
appear on the World Wide Web. <br>
<p>
Steve Hassan, a Boston-based cult expert who has counseled former members <br>
and their families for 20 years, says the<br>
Internet is a simmering cauldron of cult activity. <br>
<p>
"There are newsgroups about different cults, there are webpages put up by <br>
different cults. Aum Shinrikyo (the Japanese cult<br>
that attacked the Tokyo subway with poison gas in 1995) recruited on the <br>
Web and produced animated videotapes," he says.<br>
"I've heard of some people who have been recruited on the Web, but no one <br>
knows the numbers." <br>
<p>
Arnold Chanon Bloch, a Los Angeles psychotherapist who has worked with <br>
scores of cult members and their families, says,<br>
"If the theology is carefully laid out in print, it's going to have an <br>
appeal to people who are experiencing a spiritual void or<br>
unresolved psychological pain." <br>
<p>
Lure of the message <br>
<p>
There is little information about how many members actually were <br>
recruited that way by the Rancho Santa Fe cult. But Bloch<br>
says there are times in our lives when we all could be susceptible to the <br>
lure of a cult's comforting philosophy. <br>
<p>
"A time of personal crisis, the loss of loved one, a medical problem, <br>
they can lead us all to ask questions that are hard to<br>
answer," he says. "For people who are less socially integrated, I would <br>
say the Internet could be another pathway for groups<br>
trying to recruit new membership." <br>
<p>
According to information garnered from the group's own leaflets, <br>
newspaper ads and its Heaven's Gate Web site, the cult<br>
began as a commune in the mid-1970s and developed a cosmology drawn from <br>
Eastern and Western religions, New Age<br>
philosophies, UFO rumors and Star Trek wistfulness. <br>
<p>
The cult sought new devotees, first by the traditional means of meetings <br>
and word of mouth and then by a growing use of<br>
media. <br>
<p>
On May 27, 1993, the group, calling itself Total Overcomers Anonymous, <br>
took out a $29,911 three-quarter-page ad on the<br>
op-ed page of USA TODAY titled, "UFO CULT RESURFACES WITH FINAL OFFER." <br>
<p>
In January 1994, according to its Web site text, "we sold all of our <br>
worldly possessions except for a few cars and changes of<br>
clothing and set out cross country holding free public meetings from <br>
coast to coast for nine months . . ." <br>
<p>
It was during that tour that Waldrep saw the group in Birmingham. The <br>
members called themselves Sawyer, Even, Millie and<br>
Nora. They said their leaders were Do and Ti, although they said names <br>
were as unimportant as the temporary bodies our<br>
spirits inhabit. <br>
<p>
"They were pleasant, healthy, good-looking people who used UFOs as a way <br>
to draw people to the meeting, but the real lure<br>
was to offer a way of filling the spiritual vacuum in the audience," <br>
Waldrep says. <br>
<p>
But when the face-to-face recruitment ended, the group sought other <br>
means. <br>
<p>
In September 1995 it surfaced on line as "Undercover 'Jesus' " and "ET <br>
Presently Incarnate." <br>
<p>
On its Web site the group members recounted how the verbal attacks and <br>
ridicule they received on their 1994 tour "was the<br>
signal to us to begin our preparations to return 'home.' " <br>
<p>
The effect of the group's presence on the Internet remains unknown. But <br>
Waldrep, Bloch and the others familiar with cults say<br>
their philosophies would hit the mark among the right audience. <br>
<p>
And, they say, a glitzy Web site gains a credibility among browsers. <br>
<p>
"I think people in general are willing and eager to accept what they see <br>
on the World Wide Web," says Larry Rosen, a<br>
psychologist at California State University at Dominguez Hills. "It looks <br>
so professional, and you can easily slide from a Nobel<br>
Prize winner's Web site to a Web site that can be created by anybody." <br>
<p>
David Greenfield, a West Hartford, Conn. psychologist who works with <br>
computer addicts, says part of the Internet's power is<br>
that groups can present bizarre messages in a mainstream way. <br>
<p>
Recruiting followers on the Internet is more efficient because the cults <br>
"will reach a lot of disenfranchised people with it."<br>
Computer communication requires no social skills, he says, and is for <br>
many users an isolated activity. <br>
<p>
"I'm not saying that everybody that hangs out on the Net all day long is <br>
a loser, but I am saying that if you hang out on the<br>
Internet all day long, you will be a loser." <br>
<p>
As officials struggle with the task of identifying the victims in Rancho <br>
Santa Fe, Waldrep worries about the uncounted number<br>
of devotees to this or other cults who may be out there looking for <br>
answers. <br>
<p>
"It saddens me that people are out there looking for something to fufill <br>
their lives and instead of finding that fufillment they find<br>
something that leads to their deaths," says Waldrep. <br>
