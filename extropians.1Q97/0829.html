Lee Daniel Crocker is concerned that I have fallen prey to some dangerous, <br>
evil memes, such as "Argument is a zero-sum contest.", "You shouldn't offend <br>
people.", and "People can be hurt by words.".  I am grateful that he is <br>
concerned for my mental welfare, but I am not clear on why these memes are <br>
dangerous or evil.  My comments on each meme follow:<br>
<p>
<p>
 --  "Argument is a zero-sum contest."  --<br>
<p>
The typical argument, that people generally engage in, where each is pitted <br>
relentlessly against the other to prove their point *is* a zero-sum game (most <br>
often a negative-sum game), and I don't recommend that people engage in these <br>
sorts of exchanges if their purpose is to develop a healthy relationship with <br>
each other.  If both participants are open-minded and rational, then the <br>
argument can be used to help them each develop their understanding of the <br>
issue and would then be a positive-sum game.  So, an argumentative <br>
conversational style could be either a negative, zero or positive-sum <br>
exchange, depending on the approach of the participants.<br>
<p>
However, I believe that a discussion-based conversational style works even <br>
better than an argumentative one in exploring most issues.  It allows all <br>
participants to point out the strengths and weaknesses in the ideas under <br>
disscussion rather than constraining the participants to point out only the <br>
strengths of their own position and the weaknesses of the other participants' <br>
positions, as the argumentative style does.  Each participant is encouraged to <br>
consider all viewpoints and express their analysis of each one.  The purpose <br>
of the discussion is to explore and come to an understanding of whatever is <br>
under discussion.  No one is pitted against another; all the participants are <br>
working cooperatively to assist each other's understanding of the issue under <br>
discussion.  This conversational style encourages participants to be open to <br>
each other's views and to think about things from different perspectives than <br>
they are accustomed to.<br>
<p>
<p>
 --  "You shouldn't offend people."  --<br>
<p>
As for the meme, "You shouldn't offend people."; perhaps it should be <br>
qualified, to say, "You shouldn't offend people, if your intent is to develop <br>
a healthy relationship with them."  Whether you should offend people or not <br>
depends on your goals.  Since I am very interested in developing healthy, <br>
supportive relationships with many people, I am careful not to say or do <br>
things which I believe will be offensive to those I am dealing with.  I <br>
sometimes consider my entire life to be my own, personal business, and I <br>
intend to have an excellent Customer Service department.  I want people to <br>
like me and to trust me and to give others good references to me.  <br>
<p>
Of course, sometimes I don't know what will offend a person and what wont.  <br>
For example, someone reading this may become rantingly furious because I left <br>
out an apostrophe in my last sentence.  How am I to know that beforehand, <br>
since most people *aren't* deeply offended by missing punctuation?  But if I <br>
discover that my behavior is upsetting to someone, and if I value my <br>
relationship with them more than I value the effort required to alter my <br>
actions, I will alter my actions, so that I do not damage my relationship with <br>
them.  If I don't value my relationship with them enough, and if I do not <br>
think they will interfere with my goals too much when they are angry at me, <br>
then I will act however I please towards them.<br>
<p>
<p>
 --  "People can be hurt by words."  --<br>
<p>
"People can be hurt by words.", is not literally true, but it is true that <br>
certain belief structures will cause their hosts to feel anger or humiliation <br>
or fear or many other emotions.  In most cultures there are many words and <br>
phrases which members of the culture are expected to react to in certain ways. <br>
 For example, in American culture, if someone says something like, "You're an <br>
asshole!" to someone else, the recipient of the message is expected to feel <br>
the emotion, 'anger', and then proclaim something equally ridiculous about the <br>
one delivering the message.  The exchange is expected to end when one of them <br>
stomps away, feeling great anger, or often the participants will be expected <br>
to disrupt the normal functioning of each other's bodies by sharply impacting <br>
each other's bodies with their own bodies (usually their hands, tensed up into <br>
fists) or with other objects, such as clubs, knives or guns.<br>
<p>
Words may not literally hurt people, but while living in a human culture that <br>
encourages much conflict among its members (as the American culture does), I <br>
am careful not to inadvertantly (or deliberately) challenge another to a duel. <br>
 I don't wish to be in conflict with others.  I don't enjoy injuring others or <br>
being injured by others.  I don't generally enjoy giving others their cues <br>
that they are to become upset now.  I know the cue I give is not *causing* <br>
them to be upset, but I also know that most people *will* react in the <br>
expected manner to their cues; they're very well trained.<br>
<p>
<p>
I'm still unsure why Mr. Crocker believes these memes are dangerous or evil.  <br>
I see them as fairly useful pieces of advice when applied appropriately and <br>
when one's goal is to develop many strong and beneficial relationships with <br>
other people.  I suppose that if one interpreted those statements to mean that <br>
one should sacrafice one's own freedom to please other people, that would be <br>
harmful, but if one realizes that being considerate of other people's desires <br>
and prefrences will generally help one achieve one's goals more effectively <br>
than antagonizing others will, then the statements are good advice.  <br>

cooperatively with others is generally the best way to accomplish your own <br>
goals. --<br>
