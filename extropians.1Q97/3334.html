IAN: My first inclination was possible legal action. But by libertarian<br>
lines of argumentation, such is not necessarily an ethical course. They <br>
have a big megaphone, I have a smaller megaphone.  I slam those subsets <br>
of society I disagree with, they slam those subsets, like me, that they <br>
disagree with. I slam with facts and logical analysis, they slam with<br>
innuendo and suppression of truth, such as the truth that my claims<br>
were not false but based upon verifiable witness accounts from the<br>
major media itself. I now have a copy of the 60 Minutes smear job.<br>
<p>
With the article I've co-authored with reporters Pierre Salinger and Mike <br>
Sommer to be published in a major European magazine next week, I suspect <br>
I've only seen the beginning.  I suspect 60 Minutes was just a shot <br>
across the bow. I'm ready for battle. The FBI has been harassing and <br>
threatening several of my research associates, but we're standing strong. <br>
<p>
Of the three research associates I cited as on my crash-analysis report,<br>
two have been hit on by the FBI. The FBI is threatening one, Marshall<br>
Houston, with search warrants.  They seem to think he has too much <br>
evidence, he does not. They fear he has the satellite data or a video <br>
of the missile hit, but he does not. Richard Russell, the former crash<br>
investigator and American Airlines pilot who wrote the "anonymous<br>
internet document" now has the radar tape, and the major medias<br>
have seen it and willfully ignore it, except in Europe. <br>
<p>
Knowing the full story, anyone can see this is a massive cover-up and <br>
the small-time investigators are getting stepped on because we are on <br>
the right track. The long short, is that the Military Industrial Complex<br>
(MIC), clearly implicated in the TWA 800 disaster, owns so much, is tied <br>
in with so much, that they have far more power to control the social flow <br>
of information than the majority of people realize. The FAA, Boeing, CBS, <br>
other media,... almost everyone in the deal is in bed with the MIC.<br>
<p>
Even if by law I could sue them, from a libertarian line of ethics, <br>
I cannot sue them for having a bigger megaphone, that's my tough luck. <br>
If I don't like the heat, get out of the kitchen. But in fact, the more <br>
muck they throw at me, the more fuel they put in my engines. What 60 <br>
Minutes said about my work only tells me I'm kicking their ass, and <br>
they know it. I'll soon cite it in whole, but in sum this is what <br>
Lesley Stahl said as she pointed to my TWA 800 graphic:<br>
<p>
        "Shouldn't this be expunged? ...[because] it is <br>
        spreading fear and suspicion of the government..."<br>
<p>
Having that said against one is the dream of all freedom writers.<br>
We should fear the government,  and most particularly IF we can <br>
make a honest and logical case for such fear, which is what I've <br>
done and what I seek to do, and always based on reason and honesty.<br>
<p>
If you want to slam "the establishment" you have to take the slams <br>
youself, 60 Minutes was one of them. The difference is that they will <br>
do it with innuendo, by false and misleading misrepresentation of facts <br>
in forums that negate retort with claims that no one can verify for <br>
themselves, while I'll do it with logic, facts and claims that people <br>
can verify. I try to avoid making claims that rest on my shoulders.<br>
