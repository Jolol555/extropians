This may actually be old news - the designs seem to have been up at<br>
<a href="http://www.imm.org/Parts/index.html">http://www.imm.org/Parts/index.html</a> since January - but it just arrived<br>
in my mailbox via Foresight Institute Electronic Newsletter #1,<br>
"a quarterly email update on nanotechnology from Foresight Institute",<br>
which you will receive upon obtaining a Free Electronic Membership at<br>

<p>
The designd are for a molecular manipulator (2,596 atoms) and a<br>
neon pump (a molecule-sorting device, meant to create segregated<br>
feedtsocks - 6,165 atoms). PDB files are available.<br>

** New design for a molecular manipulator **<br>
<p>
A major new nanomachine design by Eric Drexler is available at the<br>
Institute for Molecular Manufacturing Web site. As explained by Dr.<br>
Drexler, "In collaboration with Dr. Merkle, I set out to develop an<br>
atomically detailed design for a far smaller molecular manipulator than<br>
previously had been considered - one intended not to do the whole job of<br>
molecular positioning, but to serve as a "hand" for the final, precise step<br>
of applying a molecular tool.  The resulting design uses fewer than 3,000<br>
atoms for its core mechanism..."<br>

Dr. K. Eric Drexler and Dr. Ralph Merkle will conduct a telephone seminar<br>
on March 27, 1997, on the topic of the design, modeling, and manufacture of<br>
systems for molecular nanotechnology. Christine Peterson and Gayle Pergamit<br>
will discuss nanotechnology-related career options and investment<br>
opportunities on April 24, 1997. More information, including how to<br>
register, is available at:<br>
