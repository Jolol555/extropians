Meantime, i am spurred to once again look at the role emotions ( another<br>

<p>
I don't think emotions are an artifact. Rather, I think they are an<br>
evolving aspect of (trans)human intelligence. Also, they can be, and<br>
often are, the driving force behind science and art. I think if one looks<br>
at the evolutionary tree it becomes apparent that the ability of a species<br>
to experience emotion is directly correlated with its intelligence. For<br>
example bacteria and plants don't experience any emotions, and probably<br>
neither do worms, insects etc.<br>
Dogs and cats, on the other hand, at least in my experience, have the<br>
capacity for primitive emotions such as fear and jealousy. I propose that <br>
Primates, elephants, dolphins etc. may experience the rudiments of love,<br>
friendship etc. but I don't have any evidence for that. The multitude of<br>
emotions that are experienced by humans could be refined and evolved<br>
(per)mutations of the basic emotions that I have mentioned. For example a<br>
sense of awe or wonder (possibly one of the latest emotions to evolve)<br>
could have combined elements of curiosity, love, admiration and a little <br>
fear. <br>
<p>
Well, its an idea anyway.<br>
