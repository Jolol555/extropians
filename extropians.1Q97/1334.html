&lt;snip&gt; Some great Wisdom regarding the nature of technology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even our very minds are technological in nature,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the very way we *think* has been shaped and tinkered with over many thousands</i><br>
<i>&gt; of years by countless humans, an ongoing technological project, passed down</i><br>
<i>&gt; from generation to generation.</i><br>
<p>
This is an interesting perspective, one that highlights how intertwined our<br>
beings and our actions are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Those who condemn technology as being "cold" </i><br>
<i>&gt; are condemning Humanity itself.  We *are* technology.  Our minds and thought </i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns are technology itself.  Even most of our emotional responses are </i><br>
<i>&gt; *learned*, and thus technological in nature.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Building nuclear reactors is not different in its basic nature than building</i><br>
<i>&gt; sand castles or stacking blocks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Calling technology "cold" is a form of self-damnation and self-loathing.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the "original sin" doctrine in another form.  Our basic nature is as</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological creatures, we are learning, manipulating beings.  That is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; we *are*.  To condemn technology is to condemn learning, is to condemn oneself</i><br>
<i>&gt; and one's very nature.</i><br>
<p>
These are all real gems that I'm going to remember for future reference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Death is simply a *tradition*; it is not essential to</i><br>
<i>&gt; life itself.  I say:  Question Tradition.  Find better ways of doing things.</i><br>
<p>
While I agree with most of what you said regarding death, I feel that we should<br>
not overlook the probable fact that any sufficiently great transformation is<br>
indistinguishable from death from a great many viewpoints.  In a fully trans-<br>
human life, there is little promise that our egoic identities won't be so fluid<br>
that the death of moment to moment forms (be they physical or virtual) won't be<br>
an integral part of our lives.<br>
<p>
The extropian philosophy looks rightly skeptically upon death as we have always<br>
known it.  As humans we may approach it in numerous ways (fearfully, or otherwise)<br>
but ultimately we have never had any choice whatsoever as to the ultimate result<br>
(cyronics being the first deviation from this).  With trans-humanism, I strongly<br>
believe that the extropian view of ending death is greatly oversimplified.  Sure<br>
it might no longer take place in the old way, but in the moment to moment birth<br>
and death of manifest form, I suspect we will have a smorgasbord of choices that<br>
lead in a myriad of ways; that essentially we will be trading physical death<br>
in for endless ego death in its place.  I'm all for it, but let's not under-<br>
estimate what we think we are proposing.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Having vivid memories of a past life is not sufficient evidence that one has</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually been reincarnated, and more importantly, it is not sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence that one will be reincarnated after one's life ends this time.</i><br>
<p>
The points about reincarnation are good, as the possibility for delusion runs<br>
rampant in these areas.  I would, however, apply some double skepticism about<br>
interpreting these kind of memories.  I think it's very reasonable to be <br>
skeptical of claims of reincarnation as defined in the normal sense as a one <br>
to one relation between one's ego identity and that of some person who lived<br>
in the past.  Going beyond this, however, to reject random memories of people<br>
who have lived in the past, for me, requires assumptions about the nature of<br>
reality that I'm not convinced are justified.  Sure it's outside the existing<br>
paradigm, but on the other hand the paradigm is just theory (albeit a very<br>
good one as compared to past ones) while the memory itself (if one has had such)<br>
is direct experience, and holding theory out over direct experience is always<br>
a shaky proposition.  (I remember reading somewhere that 150 years ago, theory<br>
told us that women didn't have orgasms.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, the experience of the Divine is self-generated.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; one is out in a forest or on a high mountain and one feels one's deep</i><br>
<i>&gt; connection to everything, the feeling is quite orgasmic, and we call it</i><br>
<i>&gt; Divine.  The experience of the Divine is self-generated and masturbatory in</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature.  The feeling is very real, but we are the cause of it.  It's basically</i><br>
<i>&gt; a drug induced state of mind, like an orgasm is; it's just that the drugs are</i><br>
<i>&gt; created by our own bodies, just like an orgasm.  The most potent drugs are</i><br>
<i>&gt; produced right in our own brains.  Those, like myself, who have experienced</i><br>
<i>&gt; these "Divine" states of mind, become very addicted to that drug-induced state</i><br>
<i>&gt; of mind, and we work at finding more reliable ways to trigger this response</i><br>
<i>&gt; within ourselves.  These methods are our rituals (a form of technology), which</i><br>
<i>&gt; we modify and evolve, to make them more effective at producing the effects we</i><br>
<i>&gt; want.  We are druggies, basically, trying to get our fix.  Pure hedonism.</i><br>
<p>
Very true, but:  Are these experiences "real"?  If they connect us to some<br>
aspect of reality that we ordinarily miss, then perhaps masturbatory might not<br>
be the correct word.  Or slightly easier, do these experiences "have value"?<br>
Your own next paragraph answers the second question.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I welcome Joy Williams to the Extropan List;  I am sure that Joy has much to</i><br>
<i>&gt; offer and can contribute to our lively discussions of all kinds of interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; things.  I am an Extropian who also, like Joy, embraces "spiritual" things, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sense of being highly sensitive to the dynamics of life around me and</i><br>
<i>&gt; becoming highly affected by beautiful experiences.  I work to maintain that</i><br>
<i>&gt; beautiful background hum of bliss and contentment that marks the spiritual</i><br>
<i>&gt; life, and I strive to deepen my awareness and appreciation of every detail in</i><br>
<i>&gt; my life.  Extropianism is not against spirituality, but it *is* against dogma,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because dogma closes one off to finding better ways of doing things, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; finding better ways of doing things is the core of Extropianism.</i><br>
<p>
All in all, I thank you for your insightful and well thought-out post.  I<br>
find your writing inspiring, and the more I read it, the more I like it.<br>
