I believe it does necessarily follow, and wages would necessarily decline.<br>
The argument is a simple application of the same economic laws that have<br>
caused working hours to decline.  As wages have risen (and I don't know<br>
really why they have risen, so I won't set forth my theories), and people<br>
have had more entertainment opportunities available, the marginal value of<br>
an additional 1 hr of working has declined and the marginal value of an<br>
additional 1 hr of leisure has risen.<br>
<p>
If everyone suddenly had 8 additional leisure hours per day, this would<br>
necessarily reduce the marginal value of leisure time.  It would also<br>
increase the marginal value of work, since people would have more time to<br>
spend money.  Necessarily, statistically speaking, people would work<br>
more hours.  Lower wages follows from the increase in the worker-hour pool,<br>
and because the minimum amount of money needed to support yourself and your<br>
family for a week, which is the minimum amount that the large unskilled labor<br>
pool will accept for a week's work, does not change (or even goes down,<br>
due to not needing a house), while the number of hours they can work doubles.<br>
