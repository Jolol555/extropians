I have been a lifelong nature lover.  At 50,  I have seen the expansion<br>
of urban sprawl around the Philadelphia metropolitan area.  Places that<br>
were relatively wild and were I hunted 30 years ago are now paved over<br>
and developed.  I have also read numerous environmental and ecological<br>
books.  Many of these writers have a view of the future in which humans<br>
live in an ever impoverished biosphere and eventually exceed the<br>
carrying capacity of the earth and cause a major ecological catastrophe.<br>
 Since I have lurked on this Extropian list during the past six months I<br>
have gained a different perspective of new technologies and eventual<br>
migration of humans or posthumans to outter space.  I just wonder if the<br>
dystopian futuristic visions of a sort of Blade Runner type landscape is<br>
what we can realistically expect or will the new technologies change the<br>
present resource consumption patterns that cause forests to be clear cut<br>
and through the extraction of fossil fuels cause Exxon Valdezes ?  Will<br>
biotechnology find new ways to feed humans so we don't have to overfish<br>
the seas causing depletion of fish such as I heard has happened at one<br>
of my favorite resorts in Perce on the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec?  Will<br>
there be a future in which a wide diversity of flora and fauna exists<br>
and also megafauna such as grizzly bears can make a comeback?  Or do<br>
Extropian posthumans value this type of wild nature?  I have mentioned<br>
the works of Daniel Quinn such as ISHMAEL.  The fictional work ISHMAEL<br>
is about an Socratic experience of a human learning about life and the<br>
world  from a gorrila.  The gorilla ISHMAEL is symbolic for the<br>
non-human biological community in the metaphor that since homo sapiens<br>
appeared on the scene God does not care anymore about the rest of<br>
creation.  How does a posthuman view a grizzly bear?  Does the grizzly<br>
bear have a right to exist:  large expanses of wild uninhabited land in<br>
which to roam?      Cyber Ed<br>
