I would say, from my experience, that most European clubbers avoid<br>
buying off the street whenever possible, and usually have personal,<br>
trusted sources. There was a dip in quality in Europe for most of the<br>
early-mid 90s, but recently things have been looking up.  (I have<br>
recently seen pills that were*very* professionally made, and *very* pukka.<br>
Relaxing of border controls, in Europe, you know.)<br>
<p>
The techno dance scene being a bit newer in the States (as a Big Thing),<br>
folk wisdom hasn't yet developed the right defensive memes, and young<br>
'uns do run a risk buying off the streets, I agree.  That is one of the<br>
many reasons why I am a libertarian.<br>
