Yes! Or rather, I don't even believe it's that they're too busy, just<br>
that they are unconscious. It is possible to bring such people to<br>
another level of consciousness (which I guess religion sometimes does in<br>
a mild way, as do modern personal-growth programs such as Context and<br>
Landmark). I've tried to do that with my books, both my self-help book<br>
(Getting Past OK) and my memetics book (Virus of the Mind). I've come to<br>
the sad provisional conclusion that it's very tough to make much of an<br>
impact on people with nonfiction. (My next book is a memetics novel,<br>
btw. I'll keep trying!)<br>
<p>
On the other hand, there have definitely been times in my life when what<br>
I THOUGHT was "thinking about the deeper questions" was more akin to<br>
unproductive mental masturbation. I would have been much better off, and<br>
learned more, by STOPPING those inquiries and going off and living some<br>
fresh, new life experiences.<br>
<p>
Sigh. It's so tough to reprogram your memes properly when your software<br>
development tools are all written in the same crufty operating system...<br>

Do you know what a "meme" is? <br>
