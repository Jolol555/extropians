<i>&gt; The fact that</i><br>

<i>&gt; physical sensations to achieve the cognitive state.</i><br>
<p>
I believe your difficulty here lies in your assumption that emotions are<br>
cognitive states. They are not. That is why we call them emotive rather<br>
than cognitive. Cognitive --&gt; cogito --&gt; think, e.g., cogito ergo sum, I<br>
*think* therefor I am. Emotions may influence thinking (abstract<br>
thought), and thinking may influence emotions, but they are not one in<br>
the same. They are qualitatively different.<br>
<p>
Quantitative aspect of emotions: The neurochemical content of the<br>
central nervous system.<br>
<p>
Qualitative aspect of emotions: Sensations felt in the body, e.g.,<br>
changes in blood pressure, heart rate, moisture in the skin, breathing,<br>
body tempature, sensitivity, arousal in erogenous zones, etcetera,<br>
etcetera.<br>
<p>
Computers today can emulate the quantitative aspect of emotions. They do<br>
not however have the proper embodiment to experience the qualitative<br>
aspect of emotions. They cannot feel. Thus computers today cannot<br>
experience emotions ... no matter how much programming is involved. They<br>
may have the potential to experience emotions, but they cannot until<br>
they have appropriate hardware.<br>
<p>
Emotions are physical feelings that usually have corrolating thoughts.<br>
For example, a person with depression will have a particular kind of<br>
neurochemical content in their CNS. Those neurotransmitters will then<br>
cause certain emotive feelings in the person and certain cognitive<br>
thoughts in the person. However the person may seek a psychologist for<br>
help, and learn to think in new ways, and though the person is thinking<br>
differently it may take some time before the person *feels* differently.<br>
Changing the cognitive thought won't necessarily immiediately change the<br>
emotive feeling. That same person may instead choose to see a<br>
psychiatrist who then prescribes prozac. The prozac acts then directly<br>
upon the CNS effecting both the emotions and the thoughts of that<br>
person. <br>
 <br>
Emotions are irrational because they are not cognitive. Cognitive things<br>
are rational. Why do so many people associate love with the heart rather<br>
than the brain? Because emotions are not cognitive. Emotions can<br>
influence the cognitive, and vise versa, but they are not the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is the common cognitive process that occurs when a blind man</i><br>
<i>&gt; hears a beatiful piece of music, and a deaf man sees a beautiful</i><br>
<i>&gt; work of art?  They share /something/ in common we call "beauty",</i><br>
<i>&gt; but it cannot be the mere sensations that evoked it; it must be some</i><br>
<i>&gt; mental state that we can recogize and express.</i><br>
<p>
We appreciate beauty because it makes us feel good. Not because it IS<br>
good. This is called synesthesia. There is no appreciation without<br>
sensation. My computer has absolutely zero ability for appreciation. No<br>
computer has the ability to appreciate. Do not confuse error statements<br>
with disastifaction. Those statements are coldly objective. You can make<br>
your computer error ceaselessly and it will never feel discomfort.<br>
However, if your computer felt a painful sensation everyone time it<br>
encountered an error, then it would feel discomfort, and it might feel<br>
anger, and those feelings of anger might then provoke violent thoughts<br>
in the computer. But it must be able to feel, and to feel it must have<br>
physical sensations.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cameras and audio</i><br>
<i>&gt; recorders "see" and "hear" the same things, but they do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognitive states.  A computer does.  To assume that a computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't recognize, experience, and express that same state from</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever inputs it has is groundless anthropocentrism.</i><br>
<p>
Recognize perhaps, express [emulate in an artificial way] perhaps, but<br>
theres no way in the world it could experience an emotion without the<br>
proper hardware. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If a computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; tells me that the bit-pattern I just entered into its front panel is</i><br>
<i>&gt; beautiful, who am I to tell him otherwise?</i><br>
<p>
Him? The computer can only determine beauty based on the criteria the<br>
programmer programmed into it. The computer cannot determine beauty<br>
based on its own experiences of emotive affect. It may *know* what<br>
beauty is supposed to be, but it has never experienced the emotive<br>
sensations of beauty.<br>
<p>
