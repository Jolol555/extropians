Hal Finney:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt; Some of their advise for weathering this storm did not fit well into</i><br>
<i> &gt; my own individualistic tendencies.  They advised becoming part of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; community, getting a reputation as someone who is good to know, someone</i><br>
<i> &gt; who helps out with local groups, etc.  Think of the people who got to</i><br>
<i> &gt; be in charge of the ration coupons during WWII.</i><br>
<p>
 ( to which Anders explains)<br>
 &lt;&lt;I don't see a problem with this and being an individualist, and it is <br>
 actually very good advice for making extropianism more reasonable to <br>
 people - if you read about it in the newspapers, it is a weird cult, but <br>
 your friend Hal is a decent chap with some good ideas. If we could be <br>
 known as the local experts on the future and "big things", people might <br>
 come to us to hear what this fuss about cloning or nanotech is.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Which is how Max is regarded, and Anders obviously and many other key people!<br>
<p>
Which fits right in with being an individual! And the trader principle...<br>
<p>
I think it is very interesting to see this discussion on "helping out" or<br>
"fitting in" "being someone who is good to know"<br>
....in other words, socialized behavior -  which is quite different from<br>
"socialism" In general, I think it is being eschewed in the effort to<br>
maintain "individuality".... <br>
<p>
I have noticed that a certain percentage of transhumans and Extropians are<br>
less than social butterflies.Perhaps even unwittingly in persuing the<br>
"individualistic tendencies" coming off as unsocial, lacking in charisma, and<br>
social grace. <br>
<p>
I have noticed this with groups of objectivists, Libertarians, cryonicists<br>
too.  I see a definite trend towards nerdiness and social ineptitude. At<br>
first I found it alarming, still do sometimes. Check out the clothing.... the<br>
hairstyles.. <br>
(NOT ALL,MIND YOU!) I wonder whether this, coupled with the nonaltruistic<br>
stance (often mistaken for a lack of love, compassion or empathy) gives<br>
people the impression that this is not the group they want to "play with".<br>
<p>
I wonder if the "individualist" (a well balanced, worldly individual who can<br>
be in many situations) can be seen by others and not misunderstood.<br>
Can this be done with just a LITTLE effort to make him/herself valuable to<br>
others ...being social, looking good, speaking, giving classes, making<br>
beautiful art... <br>
