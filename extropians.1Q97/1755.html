Many of my thoughts, especially the rigorous ones, are in English.  At<br>

And these I really don't think are possible, not without implications.<br>
Good linguistic translation is probably tantamount to AI.  If there are<br>
two faithful AIs between me and you handling communication, we're pretty<br>
close to Singularity already.<br>
