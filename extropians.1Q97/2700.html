<i>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by "debunked".  Coase has certainly not</i><br>
<i>&gt; proved that torts do better than legislatures at dealing with</i><br>
<i>&gt; externalities and public goods/bads. </i><br>
<p>
Again, that presupposes a definition of "better".  What Coase showed<br>
was that in a free market, the very idea of "public good" is a myth.<br>
Any initial assignment of property rights will result in an efficient<br>
solution in a free market, subject only to transaction costs.  It is<br>
true that perhaps some tort-law methods might have higher transaction<br>
costs than some legislative methods, and in that sense be less<br>
efficient.  I do not for a moment concede that there exist any social<br>
problems for which /no/ free market solution exists that is better<br>
in that sense than a legislative one.  If I find one, I would still <br>
be inclined to suffer that cost rather than a legislature, but I<br>
haven't found one yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Given that we had a slave trade, it would indeed make sense to argue</i><br>
<i>&gt; about how to make it more efficient.  And since we do in fact have</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislatures, it makes sense to argue about how to make them better.</i><br>
<p>
Slavery exists today.  Americans call it the draft, Muslim nations<br>
call it marriage, the Chinese call it prison.  That doesn't mean I'm<br>
going to spend any energy on how to conduct the draft with less money,<br>
or whether women should be included.  The draft is wrong.  The only<br>
way to improve it is to abolish it, and any steps I take will be in<br>
that direction only.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Burden of proof"?  "necessary"?  There are governments now.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to convince people to work to get rid of them, you have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; convince people they would like their circumstances substantially</i><br>
<i>&gt; better without a government.  Baldface claims that govts are</i><br>
<i>&gt; "evil" are not going to get you very far toward this goal.</i><br>
<p>
All of that convincing is done well by many popular authors, just as<br>
they convinced me.  But I tend to associate with those who are already<br>
predisposed to liberty; libertarians, extropians, objectivists, et al.<br>
I do not play the role of persuader there--I play the role of extremist.<br>
Someone has to be.  We do have an ultimate goal, and I want to make<br>
sure that my fellow activists for liberty don't lost sight of the goal<br>
while they manipulate the existing system.<br>
