Extropianism, in the "big-E" phase of intense parcipation on the<br>
list, activism, elaborate mentating beyond our circle of influence,<br>
etc. is a stage we should all pass through.  It's also<br>
a stage we should evolve beyond, excepting perhaps a few "keepers of<br>
the flame" who can make a living while maintaining such a state of mind.<br>
<p>
When I hear the "Extropian ideas are greedy" critique, it reminds me of the <br>
related misconception about Objectivists, shared by themseves and their<br>
critics alike, that they are "selfish".  Nonsense.  Many are the Objectivists<br>
out there living in near poverty (especially in light of their mental<br>
potential), expending their engergies in selflessly trying to promote their<br>
cause.   Many have been the acts of immense ideological altruism among the<br>
Objectivists.  Objectivists are altruists promoting selfishness, whereas<br>
they must compete with selfish people promoting altruism.  If Objectvists<br>
were consistent they'd go over to the enemy.<br>
<p>
An analogous phenomenon exists with many Extropians.   We have a philosophy <br>
of individual self-improvement but we practice it only in the abstract, in <br>
the imagination, in philosophizing and principalizing and argument, but <br>
not in our daily present lives.   We rant against "deathism" and eat (some <br>
even smoke!) carcinogenic crap, drive and fly recklessly, stay overweight,<br>
and so on.  We value personal liberty, and promote privacy in the abstract, <br>
but haven't done much of anything to increase the privacy or liberty of<br>
our own lives.  We promote the ludicrously futile efforts of Browne the <br>
fringe whacko candidate but do little to find freedom in an unfree world.  <br>
We dream of immensely valuable future conditions but spend so much <br>
time with these future scenarios that we are doing less that will get<br>
ourselves to that future than the superstitious Mormon following a <br>
culturally evolved, basic healthy lifestyle.<br>
<p>
It's great dreaming of the future, but the future will actually belong to<br>
those who make it there.  Here are some steps I hope we can take to make it<br>
there:<br>
+ Don't rant on about the virtues of selfishness, you are contradcting<br>
yourself.  If you think selfishness is so great, then you should just be <br>
selfish and not let anybody else in on it.  (Unless of course you obtain <br>
joy by bothering people!).  the people who make it to the future will<br>
have cared immensely about themvelves, but they will also have pulled<br>
together, to solve the many public goods problems we need to solve, such <br>
as creating a hospitable climate (freedom for transhuman efforts in a<br>
Luddite world), getting each other out of cryonics at the other end, and <br>
so on.<br>
+ be more focused on particular areas of expertise where we can <br>
make a difference in the short term.  "Tend our own gardens" -- Voltaire.<br>
"Operate in the circle of influence" -- Covey.<br>
+ we need to be much more _short_ sighted, greedy and local when it<br>
comes to most of our lives.  We can live and proper in the present, <br>
creating capital with which to get to the future, in light of knowledge<br>
of our longer-term path and potential.  Don't obsess about the grass<br>
greener over the hill and starve in the pastures where we presently<br>
can graze, to get the energy needed to make it over the hill.<br>
<p>
Greed is good!  As is cooperation!  Lose the pathological <br>
combination of selfishness and future-obsession, but  keep<br>
in mind the lessons we have learned and the wonder awaiting us<br>
if we succeed in the here and now.<br>
<p>
Onwards, <br>
Zylof<br>
