<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Depends on how fast we can expand, which isn't yet clear.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We could expand at a rate of 0.50% of light speed in all</i><br>
<i>&gt;directions (.005 C) and still have the ability to allow 50% of all of</i><br>
<i>&gt;humanity to escape destruction, assuming they are still human in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;million years. </i><br>
<p>
That would be fine, but .005 C is 1,500 km/sec, which is really fast for<br>
something big enough to function for the 1000 or so years it would need to<br>
get to a nearby star (5 ly).  <br>
<p>
But, to be fair, if we have on average 100,000,000 years and need to travel<br>
1,000 ly, 1/100,000 of the speed of light will do (3 km/sec).  If deep-space<br>
colonization is possible at all, that is certainly doable.  So I guess<br>
gamma-ray bursters aren't a serious problem for any deep-space civilization<br>
bigger than one burst.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given the vastness of space, it will hardly be like the evactuation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;city. Even using salt mines would suffice for planetary protection,</i><br>
<i>&gt;while with space, there are plenty of comets to go around in the Kuiper</i><br>
<i>&gt;belts of most stars. </i><br>
<p>
The limiting factor for survival is not cubic volume, but infrastructure.<br>
 That's bound to be in limited supply, and because building burst-hardened<br>
infrastructure is very expensive, there will be very little built to survive<br>
a burst unless we have plenty of warning and a fair amount of determination.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even at a slow rate of human expansion, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;population density will still be less than one person per cubic AU or</i><br>
<i>&gt;even small fractions of that.</i><br>
<p>
Population density will be much higher for inhabited space, obviously.  In<br>
any case, it's irrelevant, as space and the things in it need a lot of work<br>
before they are suitable for human occupation through a 100-year flare of<br>
hard radiation.<br>
<p>
Hey, where's my reference?  I want to read up on those technectium deposits.<br>
