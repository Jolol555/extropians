Excuse me while I execute a counter-strike...<br>
<p>
I put forward a premise:  There are only two types of factors which<br>
contribute to one's development as a human being:  those traits which<br>
are genetically determined at conception, and all other factors which<br>
are imparted after that point.  I put forward another premise:  those<br>
traits which are not determined at conception are NOT "fundamental"<br>
qualities, and are therefore determined not by DNA, but by environment.<br>
<p>
Society, clearly, is part of the latter group.  Now, you argue that<br>
whatever discouragement women might receive in becoming a mathematic<br>
genius is at best equal to Abel's trials, and therefore negligible. It's<br>
implicit in your argument if Abel could overcome such obstacles, anyone<br>
with equal intellectual potential should be able to overcome similar<br>
impediments and become a genius.  "The fact that women are discouraged<br>
is not an explanation for the lack of female mathematicians."<br>
<p>
Well, if social conditions aren't at fault for the lack of female genius<br>
in math, then it must be a genetic trait.  If not determined by<br>
environment, it must be determined at conception.  If so, isn't it about<br>
time that someone provide evidence that the Y chromosome imparts a gene<br>
for hard-work or mathematic genius?  Mustn't this argument move to<br>
BIOLOGY in order to find the truth?<br>
<p>
I will not be convinced that women share ANY fundamental traits unless I<br>
see biological evidence to support that claim.  If the trait is not<br>
determined at conception, then the difference must not be genetic, and<br>
therefore it is not a "fundamental" trait of women.  I am assuming "the<br>
benefit of the doubt" that women are individuals and that women can be<br>
geniuses, but that seems perfectly obvious to me, based on my experience<br>
with women who are, frankly, smarter than I am.<br>
<p>
If you haven't met any women who are smarter than you are, I'd reccomend<br>
that you either correct your self-esteem problem or get out and meet<br>
more women, whichever applies.<br>
