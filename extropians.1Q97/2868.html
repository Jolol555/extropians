Depends on how you decide what will be given rights. Myself, I tend<br>
towards the view that entities that demand or desire a right (which they<br>
are presumed to understand) should be given it. Hence, if you clone<br>
yourself the young clone-baby should be given all the rights that we give<br>
ordinary babies (there is no practical distinction). If you create a<br>
braindead donor-clone, it cannot demand or even desire rights, and it is<br>
OK to use it as a cell factory. <br>
<p>
Apropos cloning for transplants, I suggest reading Greg Egan's ironic <br>
short story "The Extra":<br>
<a href="http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/issue_02/02_extra.htm">http://www.midnight.com.au/eidolon/issue_02/02_extra.htm</a><br>

<i>&gt;      An interesting aside, although I rarely read comics anymore, I've been </i><br>
<i>&gt;      unable to totally sever my ties to the IRON MAN comic book. In a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      recent issue Tony Stark, Iron Man Himself, is trapped without his </i><br>
<i>&gt;      armor by an armored super assassin. He tells the guy "If you dont </i><br>
<i>&gt;      leave, I'm going to kill you. Look deep into my eyes and you'll know </i><br>
<i>&gt;      it's true." And when the assassin looks at him a bright flash blinds </i><br>
<i>&gt;      and dazes him. As Stark runs away he thinks to himself, "It's called a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      magnesium flare, nanoteched onto contact lenses, I originally </i><br>
<i>&gt;      developed them for riot control police."</i><br>
<p>
Fun idea, I wonder how to prevent the flash from blinding the wearer and <br>
hurting his eyes? Oops, it was a comic book - cartoon physics applies! ;-)<br>
The idea might be doable without magnesium using nanotech lasers... maybe.<br>
