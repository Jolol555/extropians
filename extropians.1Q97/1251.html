<i>&gt; EWF:</i><br>
<i>&gt; With what end in mind? *That* is what I am asking you to bear in mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you engaging in discourse for mere amusement, or do you want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplish something in the world by means of your discourse? At this</i><br>
<i>&gt; point I can only conclude that you must be in it for sheer amusement, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is no point in my attempting to continue this particular argument.</i><br>
<p>
[ Note: since this is a question, I feel that answering it in this<br>
  public forum is justified even though Mr. Forste himself does not<br>
  want to continue the discussion.  I will not solicit further input<br>
  from him and will limit myself to the question posed. ]<br>
<p>
This seems to be our central point of contention: What is the purpose<br>
of argumentation, and which methods best achieve that purpose?  Let us<br>
call the two methods currently under consideration "hawk" and "dove":<br>
a hawk is vocal, unrestrained, brutally honest, even deliberately<br>
provocative.  A dove is honest but restrained, tries to predict his<br>
listener's reactions, argues in his listener's terms, and avoids at all<br>
cost causing his listener to break off dicussion in anger.  It is clear<br>
that there are different listener strategies as well, being more or less<br>
receptive to new ideas, more or less willing to devote time to the game,<br>
more or less sensitive to offense.<br>
<p>
It will be difficult to assign quantitative payoffs to the outcomes to<br>
arrive at a stable mix of strategies, but if we can get at least an<br>
estimate of their signs and magnitudes, we can at least reach /some/<br>
conclusions about the nature of the stable mix, and try to match those<br>
with evidence from the historical record.  It is necessary at<br>
this point to identify the purpose.  Why do we argue?  In the short<br>
run, we are trying to convince a listener that some assertion of ours<br>
is true.  But that's /too/ short term.  In the long run, one argues<br>
for an idea because one believes it will be to your benefit for more<br>
of the population as a whole to hold the idea.  I argue for "free trade"<br>
because it benefits me to have more producers to trade with.  It also<br>
benefits my listener, but that is not my ultimate goal; ultimately,<br>
selfishly, I am concerned only with the argument's payoff to me.  If I<br>
benefit my listener in the process, that's fine--and inevitable--but<br>
still it is only my benefit in having the idea spread through the<br>
population that I must consider in formulating a strategy.<br>
<p>
There is another thing to consider: Ideas have an objective survival<br>
value.  Some ideas are, by their nature, more likely to benefit you<br>
than others.  The paragraph above assumes that the speaker holds the<br>
valuable idea, and that therefore transmitting the idea successfully<br>
has a positive payoff.  I cannot assume symmetry without loss of<br>
generality, because the functions of transmitting and evaluating an<br>
idea are not seperable: the process of communication also brings them<br>
out for evaluation.  So the mathematical model becomes quite complex.<br>
Even moreso than the predator/prey and male/female relationships that<br>
occupy so much of the literature on evolutionarily stable strategies.<br>
<p>
So I'm going to cop out for the moment.  Rather than set up the six-<br>
variable simulation (an interesting exercise I may well investigate<br>
at some point) of two speaker strategies, two listener strategies and<br>
two idea-evaluation strategies, I will lazily resort to the historical<br>
record directly as evidence that a combined strategy is more stable<br>
than a fixed one.<br>
<p>
Let's an idea like "American Independence" and see how it spread.<br>
Certainly there were hawkish arguments: Samuel Adams's "may posterity<br>
forget you were our countrymen"; Jefferson's "blood of patriots and<br>
tyrants".  Certainly there were dovish arguments as well.  Even<br>
Jefferson's own letters to his friends and family were quite mild.<br>
Why the difference?  Perhaps because the costs of one-to-one discourse<br>
are different from those of publication.<br>
<p>
The cost of arguing one-to-one is very high.  You must invest time<br>
toward the goal of only one "conversion", and the risk of alienation<br>
is therefore more costly.  Also, you may have an investment in the<br>
listener himself.  Pissing off your brother is very detrimental, but<br>
pissing off 100 strangers with an argument that convinces 1000 is a<br>
fair bargain.  But even if publication lowered the risk of hawkish<br>
argument, it would still be less effective if a dovish publication<br>
might have convinced all 1100 readers.  Why, then, is there plain<br>
evidence of hawkish argument (the aforementioned revolutionaries,<br>
evangelists, Ayn Rand)?  Perhaps there is a risk in dovish argument<br>
as well.  There is also more cost to dovish argument.  A writer might<br>
have to tailor different articles to varied audiences, spend more <br>
learning about their prejudices and motivations, learning their<br>
peculiar vocabulary.  There is also likely an advantage to hawks<br>
that they are more likely to inspire readers to evangelize in turn.<br>
Hawkish arguments tend to be shorter as well.<br>
<p>
Should one then always speak dovishly in person and hawkishly in<br>
print?  No, because in a world of exclusively hawkish publications,<br>
a few dovish ones will find an easy market in the pissed-off hundreds.<br>
And a dovish argument that has already been paid for (say one that I<br>
developed for my brother) can be cheaply published to a selected<br>
audience of similar listeners.  And certain persons you might know<br>
to be tolerant of hawkishness in person.  And even those who are not<br>
may serve the purpose of shutting out your argument early if they<br>
would have been unreceptive to it anyway, thereby allowing you to<br>
invest in more profitable argument elsewhere.  So even one-to-one,<br>
if dovish argument always succeeds more often than hawkish, the<br>
costs may still favor a mix of strategies.<br>
<p>
This historical data convinces me that neither strategy is stable<br>
in isolation, but that a mix of them is likely to be.  Why then am I<br>
exclusively hawkish on this forum (even though I am actually quite<br>
dovish in person)?  Because somebody has to be, and I'm good at it.<br>
I must extend my gratitude, though, to those skilled doves who spread<br>
ideas to those I fail to reach, because even though history may<br>
remember the words of the hawks, they only remember the hawks who had<br>
enough doves on their side to spread the ideas to everyone.<br>
