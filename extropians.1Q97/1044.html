<i>&gt; I can imagine (sort of, anyway) worlds where there was just a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; flowing images and sounds and there were no objects.  Regions of color</i><br>
<i>&gt; may come together or split up and swirl around with other colors and</i><br>
<i>&gt; mix in interesting ways.  The user could influence their sensations in</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain ways, using a data suit to input.  They would have no bodily</i><br>
<i>&gt; representation, like we have here, but they would have influence over</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they experienced, and they would explore that, like babies explore</i><br>
<i>&gt; their influence over their sensory worlds, and start finding general</i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns in it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some of the patterns we have found in our sensory worlds are the patterns</i><br>
<i>&gt; of objects, of sensations that consistently go together.  These objects</i><br>
<i>&gt; relate to each other in certain, consistent ways, and we can construct</i><br>
<i>&gt; an arithmetic, based on this.  Other sensory worlds would have different</i><br>
<i>&gt; underlying patterns, and the minds experiencing them would think in</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms of those patterns.</i><br>
<p>
This is an intriguing concept.  I think the idea is that beings from<br>
such a world might not come up with a mathematics in which 1+1=2.  Maybe<br>
they would come up with some other mathematics, equally consistent, but<br>
more useful in their world.<br>
<p>
This is a reminder that talking about "a world in which 1+1=3" is<br>
not really the right way to think of it.  Mathematics is consistent<br>
within itself irrespective of any given worlds.  To ask whether a given<br>
mathematics applies to a world you need to try to set up a mapping<br>
between the mathematical objects and aspects of the physical world.<br>
If the mapping is consistent then the mathematics can be said to apply.<br>
<p>
I suspect though that with sufficient effort (and stubborness) you could<br>
set up a mapping between any mathematics and any world.  It might not<br>
be very simple, you might have to introduce arbitrary and unnatural<br>
definitions and "objects".  In the limit, the mapping would practically<br>
ignore the world and just force its own object definitions which had no<br>
correspondence to any natural physical reality.  So in practice we can<br>
judge the degree of applicability of a mathematics by looking at how<br>
complicated the mapping has to be.  Unfortunately this assumes a certain<br>
objective reality to this complexity judgement.<br>
<p>
In David's world, then, the question is whether we would say that 1+1<br>
does not equal 2 there, or would we say that 1+1=2 there as everywhere,<br>
but beings from that world are unlikely to discover that mathematics?<br>
If the world had a spatial dimension, we could still map numbers to<br>
regions of space (which colors are flowing through) and point out that<br>
these regions can be counted and grouped completely consistently with<br>
the mathematics of the integers.  This mapping might be obvious to us,<br>
but practically incomprehensible to the beings who live there.  So it<br>
is not clear how to judge whether 1+1 would equal 2 in such a world.<br>
