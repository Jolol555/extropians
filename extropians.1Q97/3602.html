<i>&gt;&gt;  Was Darwin's theory that man evolved from simpler organisms "proper</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;And the most important, measurable, quanitifiable statistic imaginable:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of the millions of species of life on Earth ever studied, /not one/</i><br>

<p>
 Strauss &amp; Howe's theories can clearly be tested against statistics<br>
as quantifiable as that. For example, opinion polls that measure<br>
how protective U.S. adults feel about children should, if Strauss &amp;<br>
Howe are correct, show an increase in protective attitudes over the<br>
1982-2003 period and a decrease from about 2030 to 2050.<br>
 Note that the statistic you have adopted is so weak that creationism<br>
passes easily - any of those million species can be explained by the<br>
assertion that god designed them that way. (If you think evolution has<br>
provided anything more than a post-hoc rationalization of how those<br>
million species came to be, show me).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;your social theories to that test: if you postulate that some age</i><br>
<i>&gt;was "the age of heroes" or some such nonsense, show me that /everyone/</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the planet at that time fit some definable profile.</i><br>
<p>
 I'll do that after you show that all of those millions of species<br>
are perfectly adapted to their environment. See how easy it is to<br>
attack straw men?<br>
