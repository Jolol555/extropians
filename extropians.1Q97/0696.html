Well, according to what I have seen in my neuroscience studies, the genome<br>
essentially codes for the unfolding process of the brain:  various<br>
morphogens diffuse through the developing brain guiding various cell types<br>
to their destination, changing one type into another, killing some cells<br>
or opening or closing genetic switches (it reminds me of a big society of<br>
finite state machines engaged in group behavior). This process is<br>
influenced by the environment (think FAS babies), but mostly it just sets<br>
the stage for the second level or brain development during childhood,<br>
which is based on experiences and a more gradual darwinnowing of the<br>
synapses. <br>
<p>
Note that you don't need many genes for morphogens in order to get a <br>
tremendously complex structure. It should also be noted that no two <br>
brains are alike, not even in identical twins (to the despair of the fans <br>
of stereotactic surgery), which suggests that very minor variations can <br>
influence the long-term development of the brain.<br>

<p>
Was it Marvin Minsky or another AI guru who said something like: "Computer<br>
vision seems fairly easy, relative to figuring out general planning" and<br>
set a graduate student to solve problem during the summer? :-)<br>
