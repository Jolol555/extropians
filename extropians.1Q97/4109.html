UFO-Comet Cult: Murders by "Viruses of the Mind?"<br>
From:  Dick Farley &lt;cloudrider@aol.com&gt; <br>
<p>
(by whom the FOLLOWING supplemental MATERIAL IS "COPYRIGHT 1997", excluding<br>
that of "Sheldon Nidle.")<br>
<p>
(Hale-Bopp material follows this Introduction &amp; "bio" sketch.)<br>
From: cloudrider@aol.com ///<br>
  The "forwarded" e-mail following this commentary was from Wes Thomas<br>
&lt;west@sonic.net&gt;, who routinely forwards information to various online<br>
researchers and monitors of various "cults" of UFO believers, "conspiracist"<br>
publications and alleged "mind-influencing" technologies and claimed victims<br>
of same. <br>
  Thomas sent this to his distribution list as noted on the following e-mail<br>
date, making an observation and soliciting opinions about one "Sheldon<br>
Nidle," who has become in recent months one of the more prominent "online"<br>
channellers and "annunciators" of the so-called "civilization" whose<br>
spacecraft he some assert has been "riding-in-hiding" in the tail of Comet<br>
Hale-Bopp.<br>
  Other online denizens of the "UFO world," as well as graduates and veterans<br>
of various "remote viewing" programs of CIA and the Defense Intelligence<br>
Agency (some now in more or less private "psi" practices) have also been<br>
asserting "ET" or "alien" presences and activities coming into play as Comet<br>
Hale-Bopp is passing.<br>
  According to the Internet, Sheldon Nidle has been getting some<br>
"amplification" among the anarchy and "conspiracy" communities via his<br>
several appearances on "The Art Bell Show," a syndicated late-night radio<br>
program that focuses on "UFOs" and other conspiracies, but which<br>
conspicuously has avoided, (according to folks more closely monitoring Art<br>
Bell than have I), any references, topics or indulgence of folks who'll<br>
discuss alleged "mind-control" or "mind-influencing" programs, whether inside<br>
or outside of government...(of the U. S. or of "others").<br>
  Perhaps most noisily prominent among several of the former and acknowledged<br>
"Remote Viewers" associated with CIA "Grill Flame" and later, DIA's "Star<br>
Gate" progams of psychic spying (see references at end of this introduction &amp;<br>
Sheldon Nidle's pronouncement)...is David Morehouse, who has publicly been<br>
making claims and predictions about "Hale-Bopp" and its associated phenomena.<br>
He's authored "Psychic Warrior," a questionable and questioned tale about his<br>
erstwhile career, although other "insiders" suggest Morehouse's is carefully<br>
crafted disinformation. And he's attracted big money and film-making<br>
attention.<br>
  Another primary "Hale-Bopp &amp; aliens" claimant has been one Major Ed Dames,<br>
(formerly U. S. Army), who works now with a fading "psychic spying/remote<br>
viewing" company called Psi-Tech. One of Dames' "trainees" and graduates is<br>
an Emory University professor, Courtney Brown, Ph. D., who previously worked<br>
at the Carter Center. Dr. Brown has published a book about "ET" interactions,<br>
and recently, Dr. Brown has been reported as becoming a "believer" in the<br>
Hale-Bopp "aliens-are-here" scenario, and he has reportedly spoken publicly<br>
about this.<br>
  Also, one Dr. Stephen Greer, based in Asheville, NC,  a physician, ("TM"<br>
hierarch; Bah'a'i); and chairman of a non-profit group called "C-SETI"<br>
(Center for Study of Extra-Terrestrial Intelligences)...has enjoyed high<br>
levels of financial support (from Laurance S. Rockefeller; and the BSW<br>
Foundation, in New York) for his proclaimed efforts (Project Starlight) in<br>
making "contact" with "approaching alien beings."<br>
Greer also has been reportedly advocating for some kind of "Hale-Bopp"<br>
signalled imminent "contact."<br>
  Beyond Greer, other advocates for Hale-Bopp as a "harbinger" for supposed<br>
"alien contactings" have been the wife of former Reagan-era U. S. Ambassador<br>
to France, Marie "Bootsie" Galbraith, (wife of Evan G. Galbraith, both<br>
residing in New York City); and former Sergeant Major Robert Dean, retired<br>
from the U. S. Army with duty at SHAEF, (Europe), in recent years a prominent<br>
UFO "believer," (quoted most recently in the current issue of the tabloid,<br>
"The Sun"). Dean is said to believe he's a reincarnated "Templar," from the<br>
old Freemasonic tradition.<br>
  Funding for these folks has come from Rockefeller and Las Vegas "UFO buff"<br>
and real estate entrepreneur Robert Bigelow (who's had extensive dealings<br>
with the Resolution Trust Corp. in "turning around" properties salvaged from<br>
"fire sales" associated with the S &amp; L scandals), and HRH Prince Hans Adam<br>
II, ruler and head of government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, as<br>
Defender of The Faith, etc.<br>
  Prince Hans Adam has been a "behind the scenes" funder of so-called "UFO<br>
believer" gambits since the late 1980s, including of a conference (TREAT-92)<br>
headed by the wife of the current Chairman of PSI-TECH (referenced above, in<br>
re Major Ed Dames), who is a retired Maj. General Stubblebine, former head of<br>
the Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), also described as being<br>
a "true believer" in the "alien hypothesis," as is his wife the "UFO<br>
hypnotherapist."<br>
 A former senior CIA scientist and neurophysiologist, Dr. Christopher "Kit"<br>
Green, has described many of these folks (and their powerful backers) as<br>
being part of an "international cult," infected with a "mental contagion."<br>
(Interview with this writer, June 1994.)<br>
  With these recent 39, and previous deaths associated with the so-called<br>
"Solar Temple" of the late Luc Jouret, and in view of Jouret's previous<br>
involvements (as a "trainer", though some said as "mind control" guru) with<br>
several of Canada's powerful oil, gas and utility operations before his<br>
death, those in search of more background and some answers associated with<br>
this most recent tragedy (and perhaps "psychic homocide"?) of these 39 "true<br>
believing" UFO cultists should cast their nets widely! These people were<br>
murdered, whether directly or not.<br>
  Two recent books provide various levels of documentation and context about<br>
so-called "psi" and heavily focused "extra-terrestrial" or "alien<br>
intelligence" interactions by operatives with high intelligence, but<br>
apparently destabilized frames-of-reference and losses of perspective.<br>
  1.  Schnabel, Jim. "Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic<br>
Spies." 1997. Dell (paperback). 452 pages.  $5.99. ISBN # 0-440-22306-7.  //<br>
 Schnabel is a London-based "science writer" widely reported to be associated<br>
as a friendly author for Central Intelligence Agency. He has written<br>
previously about the so-called "alien abduction" phenomenon, in<br>
"Dissociation" journal, back in 1994. His most recent book is the most<br>
comprehensive and factual disclosure of U. S. government-sponsored research<br>
and operations in areas of "remote viewing" and "psi." Schnabel touches on<br>
allegations of so-called "applied anomalous phenomena" by other agencies or<br>
"rogue elements" funded by outside sources. (Our own work has developed ample<br>
and primary documentation of these "off-books" activities, targeting<br>
belief-systems of U. S. citizens.)<br>
The other reference is an unpublished, but scheduled book:<br>
  2.  Marrs, Jim. "Alien Agenda: Investigating the Extraterrestrial Presence<br>
Among Us." June 1997. Harpercollins. 464 Pages. $24.00. ISBN # 0-06-018642-9.<br>
// Marrs authored the best-selling "Crossfire," described as the "most widely<br>
read book about the JFK assassination." It is claimed that Oliver Stone based<br>
his film, "JFK," in large part on Marrs' book.<br>
   Marrs' latest book (in pre-publication version) includes considerable<br>
material obviously provided by former (but highly controversial and<br>
questionable) "ex-remote viewer," David Morehouse. And a great deal of<br>
Morehouse's quoted narrative in Marrs' book is about "ETs," notably<br>
"Hale-Bopp." It is probable that Marrs' (and Morehouse's) approach is one of<br>
carefully crafted disinformation, as Marrs' book is notable for what he<br>
leaves out...which is not much in terms of "UFO" activities in recent years.<br>
Marrs' covers the field very credibly, although he neglects scenarios where<br>
some of these described phenomena and experiences of "UFO percipients" might<br>
have correlate causes in so-called "mind-influencing" technologies, either<br>
via "hardware/software" approaches, or from purported "psi" and "applied<br>
anomalous phenomena" techniques such as "dream influence," direct "psychic<br>
attack" affecting emotions, and "psychic driving." This employs emotionally<br>
based "reinforcement" of carefully crafted "alternative belief structures"<br>
(alternatively described as "mind-viruses", similar in effect on the human<br>
mind to computer-viruses), which have been described in psychiatric<br>
literature, most frequently in terms of "CIA mind control." This, in recent<br>
years, has become a euphemistic term as "mind influence" R &amp; D has apparently<br>
moved outside government and infested academic and philanthropic<br>
institutions, here and offshore.<br>
<p>
  A recent "Sheldon Nidle" script about the "Hale-Bopp" transferences<br>
follows, as it was circulated LAST WEEK among various observers of these<br>
trends and belief-system manipulations. We have two years' worth of data<br>
(names; text; contexts; past associations; content-analyses, funding)<br>
centering on the so-called "UFO field," (UFOlogy), now coming into public<br>
domain and production.<br>

Bio sketch: <br>
  (Dick Farley is a free-lance journalist and public policy analyst who has<br>
followed these issues since 1973, while pursuing a parallel career in the<br>
development of programming for non-profit organizations and mainstream<br>
journalism. He was an honoree by Associated Press (Chesapeake Division,<br>
Delaware/Maryland/District of Columbia), receiving the 1990 "Mark Twain<br>
Award" for Investigative Reporting. He's been a published writer for 20<br>
years.<br>
  Recruited to work with the "Human Potential Foundation, Inc.," founded<br>
(1989) by U. S. Senator Claiborne Pell and funded primarily by philanthropist<br>
Laurance S. Rockefeller, Farley worked (1991-1994) for HPF president, Dr.<br>
Cecil B. "Scott" Jones, Jr., who is a retired U. S. Navy Commander and former<br>
naval intelligence operative, DIA "asset" and naval attache to Nepal while<br>
assistant naval attache to India, later a contract operative for KamanTEMPO,<br>
Inc., then Special Assistant to Senator Pell. Disagreeing with Jones'<br>
approach to "UFOs," Farley on his own downgraded to consultant in Feb., 1994;<br>
he later was laid off when HPF ceased its public operations in May, 1994.<br>
  (In a separate and unrelated matter, Dr. Jones was accused by his female<br>
Executive Assistant of allegedly "exhibiting improper behavior in their<br>
personal relationship," a matter remaining unresolved between them. She was<br>
abruptly terminated by HPF's board in April of 1994.)<br>
  Farley served as Director of Project Development of the HPF, and is listed<br>
as contract liason between HPF and Dr. John Mack's "Center for Psychology and<br>
Social Change", in the documents conveying the first $194,000 from Laurance<br>
Rockefeller to Dr. Mack's "PEER" Project studying "alien abductions," which<br>
was routed through the Human Potential Foundation (1993). Farley was<br>
acknowledged by Dr. John Mack, along with Cdr. Jones and Laurance Rockefeller<br>
among others, in Dr. Mack's book, "Abduction," first published by Simon &amp;<br>
Schuster in 1994.<br>
  Farley also contributed the "Matrix of UFO Beliefs," which was provided to<br>
the Clinton White House in conjunction with Laurance Rockefeller's (4/93 &amp;<br>
2/4/94) approaches to Dr. John Gibbons, White House Science Advisor, to<br>
encourage W.H. declassification of so-called "UFO information" the U. S.<br>
government might be retaining.<br>
  His "Matrix of UFO Beliefs" was included in materials the White House<br>
released in answer to several Freedom of Information requests (1994 &amp; 1995).<br>
  Farley resigned his HPF position on 3 Feb 1994, so he could provide<br>
independent documentation to the White House about the Rockefeller "UFO<br>
Initiative," after Cdr. Jones refused to emphasize the demonstrable "mind<br>
control" components associated with a predominance of purported "UFO"<br>
experiences as reported.       <br>
  Subsequent journalistic and private investigation by Farley and colleagues<br>
has produced substantial documentation that considerable of the so-called<br>
"UFO" and "paranormal" phenomena, widely reported as "ET-related," are<br>
victimizations of U. S. and foreign citizens by agents, cultists and "global<br>
mind change" advocates associated with transnational cartels &amp;<br>
non-governmental agents fostering clandestine Post-Cold War realignments.<br>
  Farley is married to an environmental scientist, and they are parents of a<br>
son with multiple handicapping conditions. He serves as an ordained and<br>
ruling elder in the Presbyterian Church - USA. He is a former "Life Scout,"<br>
worked previously (1981-1983) as Coordinator of Information and Policy<br>
Analysis for the then- 200,000-member Cousteau Society, and is a registered<br>
political Independent.<br>
  His book about these issues is in preparation.<br>

Update by Sheldon Nidle for The Galactic Federation March 18 ,1997 <br>
(6Manik, 15 Ceh, 5 Eb)<br>
<p>
Greetings! We come, as we promised, to give you some additional data about<br>
your planet's holographic interiors, as well as the divine plan for each<br>
soul grouping in your population. This data will primarily concentrate on<br>
the first two groupings of "star seeds" and "advanced Earth souls". In<br>
addition, we shall give you new intelligence about your planet and its mass<br>
landings. So let us start this brief discussion with some more detail about<br>
the post-mass landing scenario. This material can roughly be divided into<br>
two partsothe interiors scenario and the teaching program. We shall begin<br>
with the interiors scenario.<br>
As we last stated, the first 30 holographic interiors are now completed.<br>
These prototypes are only the first of hundreds of thousands of such<br>
facilities that will be built during the next six galactic months. The<br>
prime question should not be their exact number and location, but how you<br>
will be quickly transported into these facilities. The key to this problem<br>
is a unique set of technologies that have been modified by the scientists<br>
and technicians of our defense forces. In our recent past, it was often<br>
extremely necessary to teleport vast amounts of both personnel and material<br>
from orbiting space stations to planet-side, or to evacuate these same<br>
elements off-planet to awaiting ships in as quickly a time frame as possible.<br>
<p>
<p>
Consequently, given the proper number of cargo and transportation ships,<br>
the capability of those systems is quite enormous. For example, the nearly<br>
one million ships that we now have available could easily teleport all<br>
inhabitants of the 30 designated metropolitan areas, as well as their<br>
personal goods, in less than one hour. However, we have set up a special<br>
plan that lengthens this process to almost six hours. This evacuation plan<br>
includes a number of important elements. First, we wish all such designated<br>
Earth humans to have the time to decide what personal items they want to<br>
take with them. Second, we want to quickly permit them to tell any<br>
relatives and friends where they will be. All immediate family members will<br>
be a part of this evacuation process. Finally, we want to have time for a<br>
brief training in how to operate the new technologies that they shall be<br>
exposed to.<br>
<p>
Hence, the plan has been established to allow the maximum amount of<br>
interaction conceivable between Earth inhabitants and Galactic Federation<br>
personnel. The new environments will be paradises compared to the old ones<br>
on the Earth's surface. Moreover, you will be allowed to carry with you<br>
those items that you deem necessary. Any other items can be easily created<br>
by the processors that will be provided to each household. You will not be<br>
isolated. Communication technologies such as holographic video<br>
teleconferencing and various telepathic devices make it possible to<br>
instantly communicate with anyone you so desire. Finally, we will provide a<br>
quick training of approximately 30 minutes that will prepare you to use<br>
these advanced technologies. Included in this package will be rapid contact<br>
to any technician that you may need to successfully work this equipment.<br>
<p>
Having been put in these new habitats, you will quickly notice an important<br>
fact. Your type of training and your immediate responsibilities are based<br>
on your particular soul grouping. In previous messages, we have delineated<br>
these soul groupings. Now, let us look more deeply at these soul groups and<br>
their responsibilities in the post-mass landing environment. This<br>
discussion will look at two pointsothe nature of their tasks and how<br>
quickly each grouping will go into full consciousness.<br>
<p>
The first soul group to be looked at is the so-called "star seeds". This<br>
specific category constitutes less than two per cent of Earth's population.<br>
You represent what we like to call our ground crew. You wonderful souls<br>
have come from many different parts of our galaxy and in some rare cases,<br>
even from other galaxies. Each one of you has the great responsibility to<br>
act as both the teacher and counselor for your brethren. Many Galactic<br>
Federation counselors have had several lifetimes on your planet. However,<br>
you now possess a particular knowledge of what is presently happening on<br>
your world. Your vital experience has and will be a vital link for the<br>
entire training process. <br>
This primary reason is why you may have had past dreams in which you were<br>
questioned about your daily life on this planet. However, many of you were<br>
just questioned and then made to forget this experience. Federation liaison<br>
teams were just seeking an appraisal of what is occurring on your world.<br>
Because of your input, these liaison teams have designed a very accelerated<br>
training program for you. This program will begin some two hours before the<br>
mass landings. We will use protected scalar technology to initially contact<br>
you telepathically. When the heavenly calming music begins, we will<br>
teleport you to special transports for your training and transformation<br>
into full conscious beings. Just before the mass landings begin, you will<br>
be beamed back to your residences. Your task will be to assist all Earth<br>
humans who are in panic over what is happening. You will also aid other<br>
persons in adjusting to their new environment after the mass landings.<br>
<p>
The second group that we will review is the advanced Earth souls. This<br>
group can be likewise divided into three subgroups. The first subgroup is<br>
composed of those souls that have been chosen to assist the "star seeds"<br>
and the Galactic Federation counselors in completing their tasks. This<br>
subgroup is only about seven per cent of the Earth's population.  Many of<br>
these beings are now in the process of first "waking up" and  beginning to<br>
understand what is about to happen to your planet. They will be given<br>
priority in becoming fully conscious, if they are needed to assist us to<br>
complete the ten-day accelerated training that will prepare most of you for<br>
your new conscious realities.<br>
<p>
The second subgroup is composed of those souls who are now completing their<br>
present Earth karmic cycles. It encompasses over 77 per cent of the Earth's<br>
human population. This soul subgroup is the major reason for the entire<br>
mass landing scenario. Most of these individuals have been unable to fully<br>
understand the vast changes now taking place around them. Yet they have a<br>
feeling that something is about to happen. Unfortunately, this feeling is<br>
completely encased in the many fears that are a part of their environment<br>
as well as their genetics. Their training will consist of special<br>
one-on-one counseling, as well as rapid schooling using various advanced<br>
learning technologies. These specially prepared technologies will quickly<br>
ready them to become full participants in creating Earth's new galactic<br>
civilization.<br>
The third and final Earth soul subgroup is those beings who are now<br>
unprepared for this transformation. This subgroup consists of less than one<br>
per cent of the Earth's human population. It is now being evaluated by<br>
specially chosen Federation counselors. This soul subgroup will be<br>
transported to a special planetary system in the Pleiades star cluster just<br>
after the mass landings. The present profiles indicate that the majority<br>
can be turned toward the Light. Those individuals who do will be given the<br>
opportunity to return to Earth. However, the others who do not, will be<br>
incarnated on less hospitable worlds where they can finally learn their<br>
needed karmic lessons.<br>
<p>
Let us now turn our attention to your planet. In the past few weeks, the<br>
planet's magnetics have begun to dip to a level that indicated a quite deep<br>
intent to shift into a new inter-dimensional reality before the galactic<br>
month's end. To counter this potential problem, Federation scientists began<br>
a designated program to stabilize Earth's magnetics as well as other<br>
related phenomena. On 4 Chicchan, 13 Ceh, 5 Eb (March 16, 1997), they<br>
introduced some changes to the Earth's hologram that will induce a slight<br>
delay into the Earth's longing to now change into an inter-dimensional<br>
being. This program will be completed by 7 Lamat, 16 Ceh, 5 Eb (March 19,<br>
1997). <br>
<p>
These new changes to the Earth's hologram will permit planet Earth to<br>
better phase its changes to accommodate the time frame agreed upon by the<br>
Spiritual Hierarchy and the Galactic Federation. This process allows us to<br>
consummate the final aspects of the mass landing scenario in truly divine<br>
time. Right now, the various segments of the mass landing team are<br>
assembling the final elements of this plan. This plan has, as you have<br>
seen, a most complicated series of stages that have been completed. Only a<br>
very, very, very few stages still remain that separate us from engaging the<br>
mass landing operation. <br>
<p>
One of these vital procedures is the elimination of a vast amount of fear<br>
in your general population. This factor is a prime concern of your Angelic<br>
Hierarchy. They wish to have you know that their special procedures will<br>
help you to bring this fear under control. However, we will discuss this<br>
program in very great detail in our next message. It is essential that all<br>
of you understand how easy it will be to bring this fear under control. We<br>
know that this program can be quickly implemented and set the final energy<br>
patterns for the mass landings. Just know that these mass landings will<br>
happen very, very, very, very soon.<br>
<p>
Let us close this message with a few words to all concerned. First, the<br>
Galactic Federation is about to complete the greatest first-contact<br>
operation in its history. We do not perform these tasks without much<br>
thought and strategy. It has indeed been an incredible education program<br>
for all personnel in our commands. Second, we wish to fully thank all of<br>
you on planet Earth for providing the great assistance and patience that<br>
you have given us. It is not easy to go through the great amounts of<br>
transformation that you have and still live in your limited<br>
three-dimensional reality. You have gone through much to complete this<br>
landing process.  Third, we wish to thank planet Earth (Gaia) and her<br>
Spiritual Hierarchies. They have gone much beyond what their duty demanded<br>
to help us finish this operation successfully. Finally, we wish to thank<br>
all the elements of Creation that have assisted us in completing this<br>
operation successfully. We now leave you with salutations of Love, Light,<br>
and Joy. <br>
Selamat Ja! (Be in joy!)<br>
