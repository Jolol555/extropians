<i>&gt; The assertion I have been trying, but failing, to make, is just this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; The fundamental nature of most modern allopathic medicine is science,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the fundamental nature of most "alternative" medicine is quackery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I stand by that basic assessment, and I will try to explain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is always dangerous to generalize about people.  One cannot begin</i><br>
<i>&gt; every sentence with "I'm sure there are a few counterexamples, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority of group X, or the primary founders/directors/speakers of</i><br>
<i>&gt; group X, or most members of group X I have met..."  So it is important</i><br>
<i>&gt; to identify what defines the group, what gives it its identity.  Then</i><br>
<i>&gt; one can draw conclusions about the group from its nature, without</i><br>
<i>&gt; having to rely on individual examples that can be too variable.</i><br>
<p>
Very good. Like anything pioneering, the establishment, with its<br>
respected authority, declares newness as quackery, without scientific<br>
proof. It happens with ANYTHING that advances ANYTHING. The status<br>
quoers always fear change, and will use propaganda and paranoia to<br>
protect their status.<br>
<p>
WHile you demand scientific anlysis of such quackery, you do not demand<br>
scientific analysis of your opinion of quacks. Very hypocritical and<br>
unscientific...Using anecdotes to form your opinions?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The nature of allopathic medicine is science. </i><br>
<p>
And today's quackery is often tomorrows allopathy. How many shamans<br>
herbs are now big profit drugs?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The nature of most alternative medicines is mysticism.  Authorities</i><br>
<i>&gt; are revered over results--the older the authority, the better.  </i><br>
<p>
Maybe thats because they have centuries of anecdotal evidence that in<br>
sum adds up to a statistical analysis.<br>
<p>
Pretty<br>
<i>&gt; but unobservable ideas like the acupuncturist's flow of "chi" and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sub-molecular "vibrations" of the homeopath are espoused despite</i><br>
<i>&gt; centuries of lack of evidence, and the inability to measure or test.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They write books and sell them in popular bookstores without submitting</i><br>
<i>&gt; them for review. </i><br>
<p>
And "Allopathic" doctors know the power of the placebo to heal. Pure<br>
faith has the property to induce the body to heal itself. I know an<br>
anesthesiologist who is a good freind, who just was confirmed into the<br>
Catholic Church because he finally had one too many experiences of so<br>
called "miracles" happen before his eyes. One was a patient who had a<br>
near death experience come back to tell him many things about his own<br>
family members who were dead. WEIRD. I can't say I beleive him, but he<br>
is one of your so called "allopathic" scientific doctors.<br>
<p>
 They sell supplements in health food stores with<br>
<i>&gt; lots of personal recommendations, anecdotes, analogies, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; flawed reasoning as sales techniques.  They appear on talk shows to</i><br>
<i>&gt; promote their wares and to ridicule--perhaps appropriatley--some part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of modern medicine, hoping that the audience with thereby think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; any alternative is superior.  They claim to cure everything, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have "fundamental" knowlege.  When science proves them wrong, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply incorporate some part of it into their mythology in an attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep it alive, the way chiropractors finally capitulated on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; germ theory of medicine when they no longer had any choice.</i><br>
<p>
And how many "allopathic" medical procedures eventually turn out to be<br>
more harmful than helpful to patients? let me count the ways......<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, these are generalizations, but every time I go into a health food</i><br>
<i>&gt; store and read glowing endorsements on a label, or turn on Oprah and</i><br>
<i>&gt; hear some quack telling us not to immunize our children, and a doctor</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the panel quietly acknowleging when asked that "yes, science doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know everything"--as if that were a negative--the nature of the two</i><br>
<i>&gt; businesses are confirmed in my mind.</i><br>
<p>
how many drugs are indtroduced which have more harmful side effects.<br>
<p>
Here's some shocking statistics for you: Over 10,000 people die each<br>
year due to prescribed drugs conflicting, inducing allergic reactions,<br>
or being switched. Guess how many people died from nutritional<br>
supplements, herbs, marijuana use, and natural hormonal supplements: 2<br>
and they were both from Ma Huang taken in overdose.<br>
<p>
WHich is more harmful?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The choice to employ a specific method of reasoning has consequences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And since life and death depend on the consequences of medical advice</i><br>
<i>&gt; and treatment, that choice is far more important than irrelevant factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the practitioner's personality or motives, licensing authorities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; professional affiliations, the esthetic qualities of the arguments, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's personal prejudices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since all organic diseases sometimes cure themselves, and the mind has</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful effects on the body, anything one does will cure some people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But the methods of science can isolate those cases from the results of</i><br>
<i>&gt; real treatments.  A child with a ruptured spleen can choose either the</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientifically verified method of surgery, or the older authoritative</i><br>
<i>&gt; method of prayer.  There are no guarantees either way, but odds are he</i><br>
<i>&gt; will survive in the first case and die in the second.  A woman with</i><br>
<i>&gt; headaches may well find comfort and ease of pain with acupuncture.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; if they were caused by a brain tumor, her delay in seeking reponsible</i><br>
<i>&gt; diagnosis could kill her.</i><br>
<p>
Yet healthful, nutritionally balanced living will prevent both.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because actions have consequences, the people who take those actions</i><br>
<i>&gt; are responsible for them, and may properly be judged for their choices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the absence of other information, I judge a modern doctor to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientist, and I judge an alternative practitioner to be a charlatan,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even when the acupuncturist happens to make the pain go away, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; doctor loses a patient on the table.  Until the fundamental nature of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those occupations and their methods of reasoning change, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue to do so.</i><br>
<p>
Acupuncture is scientifically recognised to reduce pain by stimulating<br>
natural production of endorpins.<br>
<p>
Personally, I think that you are ignorant and are just spouting off. I<br>
highly suggest that you do some real balanced research on what studies<br>
have been done. Your opinion does not equal the weight of the studies<br>
that have been done by real MDs and PhDs and ARE out there.<br>
<p>
I was once a big skeptic like you, but I was also ignorant. I then did<br>
some research, and my opinion changed.<br>
