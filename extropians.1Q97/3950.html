"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof."  The skeptical<br>
mantra.  To most people, many of our claims are extraordinary.<br>
Sometimes we can offer deductive arguments for our positions; other<br>
times we have less support than that.  But even then we are opposing one<br>
deductive chain of reasoning to several inductive chains of experience.<br>
It is reasonable (i.e., generally works) to assume that our deductive<br>
proof is either wrong somewhere, or else if valid then ignoring some<br>
assumption.  That they can't identify it easily isn't important; the<br>
fact that they do have inductive experience countering our argument<br>
strongly suggests that there is a missing factor.<br>
<p>
Therefore to get anywhere, particularly in libertarian and<br>
anarcho-capitalist debate, we must not only show how our envisioned<br>
society could work, we must explain why current society is the way it is<br>
and why any exceptions our opponents will come up with don't apply.<br>
Preferably before they come up with the objections, to forestall claims<br>
of "special pleading" which will be made, whether doing so is fair.<br>
<p>
This is why David Friedman excites me: he actually tries to take the<br>
current world (and the people in it) seriously, and is thus more<br>
convincing than J. Random Net-libertarian.  Robin does too; it seems to<br>
be an application of economist training to libertarian interests.<br>
<p>
(Was it this list or the transhumans -- Rich Artym? -- where the utility<br>
and quality of the social sciences were challenged?)<br>
<p>
} Here I also have to agree with the critics, at least when they refer<br>
} to people who expect remarkably rapid progress toward transhuman<br>
} technologies in the next few decades.  This stuff will take a while to<br>
<p>
If you mean Singularity by 2035 (or 2015!) seems extreme, I'd agree <br>
with you.  Specifying much else on a multi-decadal scale is more than<br>
I'd want to do.<br>
<p>
} I have heard a related criticism that anyone who would especially want<br>
} to become transhuman is excessively selfish.  And I think such people<br>
} *are* more selfish than average, but "excessive" is harder to judge. <br>
 <br>
More selfish, or more openly selfish?<br>
<p>
} This highlights another core issue: to what degree does social pressure<br>
} function to stabilize our social order?  Economists like me, who tend<br>
} to ignore social pressure in our models, tend to think that the effect<br>
} is minor.  But others see social pressure which keeps people acting<br>
<p>
This still bothers me.  Religion is bloody real; how do economists<br>
account for it?  That it's a veneer under which people pursue their<br>
rational goals anyway?  I'm willing to grant that this may true to a<br>
larger extent than I'd easily imagine on my own.  Still, when I read in<br>
_Hidden Order_ the note that economics assumes rational behavior coupled<br>
with relatively simple goals, I wondered whether some 'social' goal like<br>
"seeking status" or "being 'with' other humans" or something shouldn't<br>
be factored into more speculative models.<br>

Good post, though.<br>
