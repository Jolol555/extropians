I agree, this is a new idea (I think). I see some problems with how to <br>
use it though: using some form of fast holography (since we need the 3D <br>
data) we only get optical information at a certain wavelength: how do we <br>
tell apart the different chemical states that are important for brain <br>
structure and function (like what neurotransmittor a given synapse uses <br>
or what state of LTP it is in) using optical information? Knowing the <br>
what the hardware looks like might help us deduce the internal <br>
properties, but this is likely to be highly nontrivial since it is hard <br>
enough to distinguish one cell from another using visible light. In order <br>
to get enough resolution we might need to go into the UV, and then we <br>
start having trouble with energy densities anyway.<br>

<p>
Neural state is probably not important to achieve uploading, since<br>
personhood is apparently well preserved in saved drowning victims in<br>
northern rivers;  for a while their neurons are completely inactive due to<br>
cooling, so their dynamic states are most likely lost. They emerge from <br>
the ordeal with a brief retogerade amnesia (apparently briefer than the <br>
amnesia of people with medial temporal lobe damage, suggesting that LTP <br>
in the hippocampus is preserved) but otherwise with no disruptions of <br>
self-hood (if the anoxia was not too severe, of course). <br>
<p>
If you want to upload yourself with perfect continuity, so that the <br>
transition is done in a conscious state, then you need to take neural <br>
states into account. But for a plain uploading, all you need to deal with <br>
is neural topology, chemistry and perhaps LTP state (+ similar things). <br>
