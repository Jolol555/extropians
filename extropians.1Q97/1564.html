PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         <br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News<br>
Number 305  January 27, 1997    <br>
by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein<br>
<p>
A RUDIMENTARY ATOM LASER has been created at MIT,<br>
promising significant improvements in high precision<br>
measurements with atoms and offering the prospect of future<br>
nanotechnology applications, such as atom lithography, in which<br>
lines are drawn on integrated circuits (by directly depositing<br>
atoms) with greater precision than ever before. In an atom laser<br>
the output beam consists of a single coherent atom wave, just as<br>
in a regular laser the beam consists of  a coherent light wave. <br>
The working substance for the atom laser is a Bose-Einstein<br>
condensate (BEC) of sodium atoms, cooled and contained within<br>
an atom trap by a shaped magnetic field.   BEC itself was<br>
achieved for the first time only as recently as 1995 (see Update<br>
233). It is a condition in which atoms are chilled to such low<br>
energies that, in a wavelike sense, the atoms begin to overlap and<br>
enter into a single quantum state.<br>
<p>
Wolfgang Ketterle and his colleagues at MIT make their claim<br>
of producing the first atom laser on the basis of two experimental<br>
developments, as reported in two journals this week.  In the first<br>
effort (M.-O.Mewes et al., Physical Review Letters, 27 January<br>
1997) a portion of a sodium condensate was successfully<br>
extracted under controlled conditions.  They achieve  "output<br>
coupling" by applying radiofrequency radiation to the BEC; this<br>
"tips" the atoms' spins by  an adjustable amount, putting the<br>
atoms in a superposition of quantum states.  Thereafter some of<br>
the atoms feel the effect of the surrounding magnetic field in a<br>
different way and are able to leave the atom trap.  It is these<br>
departing atoms, still enjoying the coherent properties of the BEC<br>
state, that constitute an atom laser beam. Pulled downward by<br>
gravity, the beam was observed over a distance of millimeters,<br>
although in principle it could travel further in an undisturbed<br>
vacuum environment.<br>
<p>
The second development was to verify that the atom waves are<br>
indeed coherent (M.R. Andrews et al., Science, 31 January<br>
1997). At the time of the original BEC discovery, many<br>
physicists expected the atoms in the condensate to fall into a<br>
single quantum state; some hypothesized that it could take a time<br>
equal to the age of the universe for true coherence to come about. <br>
The MIT group addressed this issue by creating two BEC clouds<br>
in a special trap. Turning off the trap allows the clouds to<br>
expand, overlap, and interfere, producing a pattern of light and<br>
dark fringes.  The observed patterns (viewed with an electronic<br>
camera) could only exist if each BEC was an intense coherent<br>
wave.  The MIT team determined that the atom wave associated<br>
with each BEC had a wavelength of 30 microns, a million times<br>
larger than the wavelengths associated with room-temperature<br>
atoms. <br>
<p>
   In addition to coherence, the atom laser waves are analogous to<br>
the light waves in an optical laser in another respect as well.  Just<br>
as a laser beam is more intense than an equivalent stream of light<br>
from the Sun, the MIT atom beam is also more intense (for a<br>
given beam spotsize) than ordinary atom beams (whose atoms<br>
possess a variety of energies) since it delivers a powerful,<br>
directional stream of atoms in a single quantum state. In other<br>
ways, the atom lasers and light lasers are different.  According to<br>
Ketterle, "Photons can be created but not atoms.  The number of<br>
atoms in an atom laser is not amplified.  What is amplified is the<br>
number of atoms in the lowest-energy quantum state, while the<br>
number of atoms in other states decreases."<br>
