              <br>

Astrologers say the many hours they spent studying their subject has made<br>
them able to predict the future better than you or I can. Ethicists say that<br>
the many hours they spent studying their subject has made them more ethical<br>
than you or I. I can find no evidence that either claim is true.<br>
<p>
Without exception, every pronouncement made by any self described "ethicist"<br>
that I have ever head of can be put in one of 3 categories.<br>
<p>
1) BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS. Example: Hitler's use of eugenics was bad.<br>
<p>
2) STUPID: Example: Logic should only be used in trivial matters not in <br>
           matters of life and death, accordingly, 10 people getting killed <br>
           is NOT better than 10 thousand people getting killed because<br>
           arithmetic is irrelevant to morality. <br>
<p>
3) EVIL: Example: If a man is suffering horribly and wishes to die we should<br>
         do everything in our power to make certain that the man does NOT get<br>
         his wish.<br>
<p>
I don't have any use for ethicists, I already know that mass murder is wrong,<br>
I don't think stupidity is a virtue, and if cruelty is ethical then I'm<br>
unethical and proud of it.<br>
           <br>
