In a message dated 97-03-04 07:23:22 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Thanks for question/observation (?).  No, I would not say that I am<br>
 "officially" anything!:) <br>
 I certainly would not want a lot of wonderful and skeptical people who do<br>
not<br>
 happen to share my views on cryonic suspension or religion to think they are<br>
 "Outside" of extropian ideas.  Or will be kicked out of the party! :)&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Great response!  ; )<br>
<p>
<p>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;I like the orientation that Extropy has in a number of areas.  Including<br>
the<br>
 pretty clear cut fact, IMHO, that most progress we as a race have made has<br>
 been a result of increasing technology.  Not new versions of old<br>
 superstitions called religions.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
 <br>
 Which does not mean there are not some wonderful, kind, thoughtful people<br>
 deeply involved in all sorts of religions.  I just happen to believe that<br>
 they would be "good" people anyway.  They are basically decent, in other<br>
 words, *despite* their particular brand of superstition, not *because* of<br>
it.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
(snip)<br>
<p>
I agree, but the sad fact is, most people think that we are sort of incapable<br>
of rational actions, never mind being good... I have watched grown men sit<br>
and say that the only reason we don't commit mayhem on a regular basis is<br>
because we have something to fear ( God's wrath ) and/or that we have been<br>
ordered from on high, by a devine source...<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks for responding in an intelligent way to my joking about<br>
definitions, there has been some attempts lately to "redefine" extropy... in<br>
sometimes  bizarre ways...<br>
<p>
Not that your statement was bizarre in anyway-  your 4 things, atheist,<br>
 skeptic, cryonics ( life extension) and Libertarianism, are pretty much<br>
Extropic staples, I guess... <br>
