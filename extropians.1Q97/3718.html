From: Chris Hind &lt;chind@juno.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Exactly what push technology is also. Imagine content SO FUCKING ADDICTIVE</i><br>
<i>&gt; you just want to sit infront of the computer/tv combo box 24 hours a day</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it's throwing all the information you CRAVE constantly at you. All</i><br>
<i>&gt; this information streaming in is aimed directly at your id. Of course this</i><br>
<i>&gt; content will come along with a advertisement or two aimed directly at your</i><br>
<i>&gt; id and you'll have to learn incredible will power to resist the urge to buy</i><br>
<i>&gt; "exactly what you were looking for".</i><br>
<p>
Gee, Chris, are you sure you don't work for the marketing dept at pointcast?<br>
<p>
This sounds pretty nice, but as I said I'm not sure there is enough<br>
information being produced in the world of the type that I CRAVE that<br>
it can come in 24 hours a day.  I might have to settle with satisfying<br>
my FUCKING ADDICTION only, say, 3 hours a day.  Poor me.<br>
<p>
These collaborative filtering ideas are certainly intriguing, and I would<br>
love it if some automated process could assemble for me everything new that<br>
I would find interesting.  Whether it is then PUSHed to me or I have to<br>
go out and PULL it in is unimportant.  The main thing is the improvements<br>
in filtering.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately I haven't seen many specifics of why changing the delivery<br>
mechanism is going to magically cause these filtering mechanisms to appear.<br>
So I will be skeptical about Chris's vision for a while longer.<br>
<p>
Is there any software out there where you can tell it a set of web pages<br>
that you like to monitor, and it will go out and check them all to see<br>
which if any have changed since your last visit?  It seems to me that this<br>
would provide a lot of the benefits touted for push.<br>
<p>
