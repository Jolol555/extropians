New Element Discovered<br>
<p>
   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by<br>
   physicists. The element, tentatively named Bureaucratonium, has no<br>
   protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it<br>
   does have<br>
   <br>
   1 neutron<br>
   125 assistant neutrons<br>
   75 vice neutrons<br>
   111 assistant vice neutrons<br>
   <br>
   This gives it an atomic mass of 312. The 312 particles are held<br>
   together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of<br>
   meson-like particles called morons.<br>
   <br>
   Since it has no electrons, Bureaucratonium is inert. However it can be<br>
   detected chemically as it impedes every action with which it comes in<br>
   contact. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of<br>
   Bureaucratonium caused one reaction to take four days to complete when<br>
   it would have normally occurred in less than one second.<br>
   <br>
   Bureaucratonium has a normal half-life of approximately three years,<br>
   at which time it does not actually decay but instead undergoes a<br>
   reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and<br>
   assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that<br>
   atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.<br>
   <br>
   Research at other laboratories indicates that Bureaucratonium occurs<br>
   naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points<br>
   such as government agencies, large Internet Service Providers, large<br>
   corporations and universities and can usually be found in the newest,<br>
   best appointed and best maintained buildings.<br>
   <br>
   Scientists point out that Bureaucratonium is known to be toxic at any<br>
   level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction<br>
   where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to<br>
   determine how Bureaucratonium can be controlled to prevent<br>
   irreversible damage, but results to-date are not promising.<br>
