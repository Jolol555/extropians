Actually, the connection is somewhat more flexible.  At the risk of<br>
grossly oversimplifying, the connection is this:  Your ability to think<br>
stems from the neurons in your brain and the connections between them.<br>
As you develop from birth (maybe even from trimester 1) to late<br>
adolescence when growth slows and finally halts, neurons develop with<br>
task-oriented connections.  This is one of the reasons that small<br>
children are so interested in spinning objects and water: they're<br>
chaotic systems which your mind slowly begins to conceptualize.<br>
Similarly, your ability to perform complex physical maneuvers stems<br>
from your ability to perceive how bouncing and thrown objects travel,<br>
as well as eye-hand coordination.  All comes from the neurons and their<br>
connections.<br>
<p>
Having a "large brain," with lots of developing neurons for most of your<br>
life, helps you with EVERYTHING mentally oriented: throwing a ball,<br>
conceptualizing complicated 3D objects, or taking integrals later in<br>
life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have noticed that a lot of women seem to have ineficient biomechanical</i><br>
<i>&gt; arm movements when throwing an object... (unrelated to muscular strength)</i><br>
<p>
Which comes back to this:  Boys and girls both have a hard time throwing<br>
if they don't try it a lot when they're little.  As very small children<br>
throw objects and watch them fly, certain connections are forged<br>
which help the child to figure out, in real time, how to hold his/her<br>
arm in order to hit the target.<br>
<p>
Girls, as you may have noticed, are definitely NOT pushed towards<br>
physical activity as children.  Stereotypically, the boy plays little<br>
league baseball while the girl spends time at home with friends.  The<br>
stereotypical boy learns competition, eye-hand coordination and 3D<br>
conceptualization, the girl learns cooperation, communication and<br>
intuition.  Thus, the stereotypical boy throws better than the<br>
stereotypical girl.<br>
