Certain folk believe that they can assign to Life whatever meaning they<br>
choose.  That, in other words, value is arbitrary.  I contend that this<br>
is a circular belief system, and one imposed by evolution.<br>
<p>
Let me define "circular belief".  A circular belief system is one that<br>
you hold because you hold it, and, if you *stopped* holding it, would<br>
not pop up again.  What atheists hate about religious beliefs is their<br>
circularity.  People are brought up to believe in God, to believe that<br>
believing in God is Right, and that questioning their belief is wrong. <br>
Many of these people, if they stopped believing that memeset, would have<br>
no reason to start believing in God again.  In other words, I'm talking<br>
about the people who hold their religion out of a sheer refusal to think<br>
about its absurdity, start over with a clean slate, and let the best<br>
memetic system win.  (I am not saying all religious people are like<br>
this.  After all, some born atheists convert to theism, blank-slate.)<br>
<p>
The defining quality of circular religious systems is that they are<br>
imposed on the mind to begin with, by culture or evolution, and that if<br>
the imposed starting postulate is abandoned, they stop being plausible.<br>
<p>
John K Clark wants to explore the galaxy, because it's "fun".  He thinks<br>
this makes exploring the galaxy meaningful.  Suppose I abandon the<br>
postulate that pleasure is valuable.  Is there any way to get back to<br>
this postulate again?<br>
<p>
Evolution says:  Pleasurable things are valuable by default.  This<br>
almost, but not quite, is the definition of pleasure - since many belief<br>
systems say that all sorts of pleasurable things are anti-valuable.<br>
<p>
So that's the seed of the circular belief system.<br>
Now abandon the idea that pleasurable things are valuable.<br>
Now, without accepting it as a postulate, prove it.<br>
<p>
If you can't do this, it's a circular belief system, and one which I -<br>
denying the basic postulate, just as John K Clark denies the existence<br>
of God - have no reason to accept, until somebody comes out with some<br>
kind of rational reasoning in favor of the basic postulate.<br>
<p>
Moreover, I'd like to remind everyone that this issue doesn't seem at<br>
all Euclid-arbitrary to me.  It's not a matter of:  Some accept this<br>
postulate, some don't.  At worst it's Godel undecidable, which means<br>
that you can accept either postulate and be consistent, but one of them<br>
is untrue to the extent of forcing a new definition of "number".  But I<br>
think that the basic postulate - "meaning is arbitrary" - is simply<br>
WRONG, and what I want everyone to accept is that anybody who starts out<br>
with this postulate is simply WRONG until they justify it.<br>
<p>
If I say:  "The Meaning of Life is pleasure" or "The Interim Meaning of<br>
Life is Singularity", I can *justify* it.  I can argue it to somebody<br>
who doesn't start out believing it.  Rightly or wrongly isn't the issue;<br>
the point is that neither are basic postulates built into the system.<br>
<p>
"The Meaning of Life is arbitrary."<br>
"Whatever is fun to Observer X, is meaningful."<br>
Well, I don't believe it yet.<br>
How do I reason to it without accepting it as given?<br>
