An appropriate response.  I agree with most of what you had to say in<br>
your post, but somewhat disagree with what I see as an assumption in<br>
your closing statement:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the political</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause of treating all humans as symmetrical with respect to ethics, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; law, default maximum potential, and social opportunity.</i><br>
<p>
and would like to propose that some additional perspectives that seem<br>
relevant to extropian philosophy here:<br>
<p>
1. Starting with my disagreement: Fighting for symmetry implies that there<br>
   is a symmetry to fight for; that all asymmetry is "strictly memetic".<br>
   Obviously this is not true, but the big question is: Are the biological<br>
   asymmetries entirely trivial with respect to the structure of our culture?<br>
   I would hazard that the answer is that some asymmetry is still significant.<br>
<p>
2. If we pursued this discussion, we may or may not reach agreement of how<br>
   significant these asymmetries are in fact, but I don't feel that this <br>
   issue is worth pursuing because no amount of debate on this list will<br>
   change the fact that society itself is not going to come to agreement<br>
   on this issue until the point is moot.<br>
<p>
3. With regard to the fact that society will fail to come to agreement, I<br>
   cite two things:<br>
<p>
   a. The woman's movement itself has vacillated on this issue of symmetry,<br>
      and today stands divided on the issue of whether women need "special<br>
      protection" within our society.<br>
<p>
   b. The more that monogamous marriages get replaced by "serial monogamy"<br>
      which in practice amounts to polygyny, the more society will feel<br>
      very deeply rooted atavistic urges to get rid of excess males; a<br>
      trend that obviously will keep society in turmoil on this issue.<br>
<p>
4. What will make the point moot?  The free market itself once nanotechnology<br>
   gives people the ability to really change their gender.  Once people who <br>
   are unhappy with their current gender have the ability to "vote with their<br>
   genitals" then there simply will no longer be any social cause to champion<br>
   in this area; assuming that life does not become so mutant that gender <br>
   itself loses its meaning.<br>
<p>
So summing it up, I would claim that:<br>
<p>
a. The rapid rate of change of technology, combined with<br>
b. The comparatively slow rate change of culture, and<br>
c. The possible genetic obstacles in modifying culture,<br>
<p>
will result in the question of gender roles becoming moot long before<br>
our society resolves these issues in any significant way.<br>
