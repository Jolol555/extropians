<i>&gt;	I disagree with Johnny Carwash's statement that some are too pious</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be swayed from their faith in god, or that faith and science can</i><br>
<i>&gt;coexist(although I think he actually said faith and nanotechnology)  I do</i><br>
<i>&gt;not see how faith and Pancritical Rationalism can exist together, and PCR</i><br>
<i>&gt;is really what is necessary for a workable scientific method.  An</i><br>
<i>&gt;unshakeable faith in god means that you could just as easily have an</i><br>
<i>&gt;unshakable faith in lamarkism.  Of course, thinking that god probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;exists, and that god irrefutably exists are two entirely separate things,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as separate as science and faith.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe I can put some insight into what I was trying to say. I come from a<br>
somewhat religious Jewish background, although I am an atheist, and I have<br>
had many debates with people who believe in God over whether or not God<br>
conflicts with science. To me, and to many others, there's nothing in<br>
rational thought that conflicts with God. To many people, including Albert<br>
Einstein, the incredible complexity of the universe, and how it all works so<br>
beautifully, is proof of God itself. There's nothing in the bible that<br>
negates the rational concepts of science. In Judaism, most people are not<br>
fundamentalists, and there is something of a consesus, (surprisingly very<br>
commonly in the very orthodox groups), that the Torah is designed for<br>
interpretation. Commentaries such as Rashi, and the Talmud go one step in<br>
that direction. The next step is the mystical discipline of Gematria, using<br>
numbers to learn more about the nature of God and of the word. In this way<br>
science and religion can coexist. The more we learn about the nature of our<br>
universe, the more we learn about God. The higher we ascend as a species,<br>
the closer we come to God. Keep in mind that the afterlife is a xtian<br>
concept, not a Jewish one. Faith in God doesn't go against science, it<br>
encourages it.<br>
