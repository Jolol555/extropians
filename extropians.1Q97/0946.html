          I agree that this is a matter of opinion. But you would <br>
          probably agree that it is *one of* the most trustable powers <br>
          in this respect? And that among the trustable powers, it is <br>
          the one most likely to be supported by a large number of <br>
          people from many different nations and cultures. (Or could <br>
          you name a more likely candidate?) <br>

          <br>

          <br>
          Well, I think that there are many reasons why many resent US <br>
          dominance. One is that they don't want to be dominated by <br>
          any alian power. A democratic UN would presumably be more <br>
          acceptable to these people. (Another reason is that they <br>
          think that many of USA's action are wicked, while in fact <br>
          they may be just shrude adaptations to the real political <br>
          world.)<br>
          <br>
          Let me ask you a question. If there were a little machine <br>
          which one could have in one's pocket, and which could cause <br>
          you and me and all our friends to die immediately, would you <br>
          prefer that only one or two persons got hold of such <br>
          gadgets, or would you feel safer if 50 000 individuals and <br>
          organisations had them?<br>
          <br>
          As long as weapons are of relatively limited destructive <br>
          capacity, it may be debatable whether concentration or <br>
          defusion would make for a safer world. But when the weapons <br>
          become so advanced that they can bestow upon a single agent <br>
          the power to cause immense damage, possibly even to <br>
          terminate the human species, then we have a different <br>
          situation.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
