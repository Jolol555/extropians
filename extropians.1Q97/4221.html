<i>&gt; Artificial Emotion Program:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   IF x occurs THEN run fear subroutine</i><br>
<i>&gt;   fear subroutine:</i><br>
<i>&gt;       PLAY scream.wav audio file</i><br>
<i>&gt;       DISPLAY ominous.jpg image file </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is that an emotion!?! When exactly did the computer feel an emotion? The</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer is processing its data and x occurs. But it did not feel x, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; merely recognizes x in a very detached manner.</i><br>
<p>
If you recognize the flight reactions of, say, a lizard as "fear", then<br>
I would have no hesitation to say that a robot programmed with certain<br>
tropisms, sensory inputs, means of interacting with the environment,<br>
memory to learn, and a program about as complex as whatever would be<br>
a reasonable calculation for the MIPS of a lizard brain, then YES, its<br>
invocation of that routine based on its inputs, and the reactions it<br>
sends to its outputs are not a whit less categorizable as "fear" than<br>
those of the lizard.  I see no reason to assume otherwise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They won't feel it if you don't give them something to feel with. What</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of your computer has the ability to feel? Exactly which part(s) can</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel?</i><br>
<p>
I might ask the same of you?  What parts of you and me feel?  The only<br>
reasonable answer I can find is potentiation patterns in the brain, which<br>
are precisely copiable onto silicon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Only one thing is required, humans and other mammals tend to have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; great number of physical organs to feel with. Computers have zero.</i><br>
<p>
Mine has a scanner, a tablet, a trackball, and two printers.  It doesn't<br>
have any locomotion or manipulation devices, but it certainly could.<br>
It also doesn't have as complex a brain as we do, or even as complex as<br>
a lizard, but probably more complex than, say, a cockroach.  Does a<br>
cockroach fear the light?<br>
<p>
I guess it comes down to two things: (1) Which is the more conservative<br>
assumption in light of our lack of evidence?  I contend that it is more<br>
reasonable to assume that we are not unique; you seem to assume that<br>
there is something special about "living" things (whatever that means).<br>
(2) Is there in fact something about the physical sensations associated<br>
with certain emotional states, without which they would be qualitatitvely<br>
different?<br>
