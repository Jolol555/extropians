<p>
Why one day or less? No military "missiles" are capable of anything but<br>
suborbital capability. Using Titan Centaurs would work, but considering<br>
the military industrial way of doing things, the loonies would see such<br>
mobilization coming.<br>
<p>
As for Earth... use those Saturns to put lots of missiles in<br>
<i>&gt; terrestrial orbit.  Then the Lunies are also at the bottom of a gravity</i><br>
<i>&gt; well. </i><br>
<p>
a few hundred miles up is still 238,500 miles away.<br>
<p>
True, from Earth orbit you'd still need to give them a big kick<br>
<i>&gt; to reach the Moon quickly, but you can get out of Earth's gravity well</i><br>
<i>&gt; ahead of time.</i><br>
<p>
But you are still talking about NO surprise capability. Surprise is<br>
essential in a first strike. READ YOUR SUN TSU.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And quite possibly frigates or bases would be put in *lunar* orbit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Better aim, and faster.  If the energy isn't enough, use nukes.  Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; much to contaminate down there...</i><br>
<p>
ANything put in lunar orbit would get shot at. A lunar Govt would<br>
neccessarily declare lunar borders to extend to L1, L4, and L5 lagrange<br>
areas, just as current earth borders claim to extend upward into space<br>
forever (which is ludicrous, as that means we are trading territories<br>
every minute!).<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } neccessarily be at least 6 feet under the lunar soil or rock surface.</i><br>
<i>&gt; } Any inhabitable space would be an automatic bomb shelter. So even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; } Earth takes out your gun, you still have the rest of your infrastructure</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 6 feet isn't much protection in the kind of warfare we're talking about.</i><br>
<p>
Sure it is. Read your 50's era directions on bomb shelter construction.<br>
Lunar habitats far exceed these requirements. On the moon, while there<br>
would be more damage in close proximity, with habitats being constructed<br>
to handle in excess of 50% of the differential between vacuum and sea<br>
level pressure, there would be less collateral damage.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } and population. The Earth population, living in a society ignorant of</i><br>
<i>&gt; } the concept of civil defense, would suffer great losses. In this</i><br>
<i>&gt; } scenario, Mutual Assured Destruction would not be a viable strategem of</i><br>
<i>&gt; } political gamesmanship.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How do you know the population would still be ignorant of civil defense?</i><br>
<p>
They are they have and they always will be. people would rather ignore a<br>
problem hoping it will go away than rationally plan to deal with it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You're changing one factor and assuming all other stay constant, when</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first change could well change other relevant factors.  But whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; civil defense is meaningful for a big and intraconnected target is</i><br>
<i>&gt; debatable.  A different problem is that the spacers may not be willing</i><br>
<i>&gt; to engage in MAD against Earth.  Earth has tons of people and the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural ecosystem -- certainly of any complexity.  Colonists *could*</i><br>
<i>&gt; have an ornery 'screw-you' attitude, willing to wipe all of the above</i><br>
<i>&gt; out for their own survival or independence; but they could also be much</i><br>
<i>&gt; more reverent or 'moral', and find threatening 'wipeout' against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mother World repugnant or unthinkable.  Asimov's Settlers are as likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; as Heinlein's Loonies.</i><br>
<p>
Any lunar settlers would contain a high percentage of people who are<br>
disposessed, alienated, exiled, as who would give up living on earth if<br>
they didn't HAVE to? THink of this: a lunar settling corporation puts<br>
together a deal with earth governments strapped with overpopulated<br>
welfare rolls to take welfarees off their hands for a set fee. The corp<br>
ships em to the moon and puts them to work shoveling dirt and growing<br>
food. how many of these people would be PISSED at the earth for kicking<br>
them out?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth, by contrast, has the problem of wiping out a few thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; ingrates wielding a big gun on a dead world.  Zap.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, but you've got a population of highly  "humane" leaders who dodge<br>
drafts, hug trees, and avoid conflict when ever they can as decisive is<br>
not a word in their vocabulary. While a sizable percentage of rabble<br>
rousers would love to wipe out the ingrates, nobody would want to pay<br>
for it.<br>
<p>
And if enough welfarees are shipped up there, you'll have all of their<br>
relatives marching on Washington for picking on minorities on other<br>
planets.<br>
