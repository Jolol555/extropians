 It isn't clear that the Fed is following such a policy. A policy<br>
of correcting the inflation rate after it notices it has printed<br>
too much or too little money to achieve the politically correct inflation<br>
rate is virtually indistinguishable from a policy of targetting<br>
a specific economic growth rate.<br>

<i>&gt;independent food-raters and ensure that each is free from corruption. </i><br>
<p>
 Of course, the FDA suffers from similar attention problems. It pays<br>
most attention to the problem that is most likely to attract voter<br>
attention - people dying from bad drugs. This takes its attention<br>
away from problems like people dying because they can't afford drugs<br>
or because the tests the FDA mandates delay availability of drugs.<br>
