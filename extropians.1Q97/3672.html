 Assuming opinion polls have no costs, then yes, they have no reason<br>
not to do so. I make no claim that they are great researchers, only<br>
that they have an interesting theory which can be confirmed or<br>
falsified.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;  Note that the statistic you have adopted is so weak that creationism</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; provided anything more than a post-hoc rationalization of how those</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; million species came to be, show me).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Freshly-constructed algorithms, with absolutely no programmed goals</i><br>
<i>&gt;other than existence, based on the underlying mechanisms of duplication,</i><br>
<i>&gt;mutation, and selection that we can observe today, exhibit the</i><br>
<i>&gt;phenomenon of adaptation in quite remarkable and unexpected ways.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is not post-hoc, since the phenomenon emerged from something that</i><br>
<i>&gt;was not programmed to produce it, and the few simple instructions the</i><br>
<i>&gt;programs were given are directly obsevable, not postulated.  It is a</i><br>
<p>
 Weak versions of evolution (that organisms adapt to their environment)<br>
can certainly be subjected to good statistical tests. I don't see how<br>
the stronger versions (e.g. that such adaptation explains the existence<br>
of the species we see today) can be subjected to statistical tests which<br>
are not post-hoc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;your social theories to that test: if you postulate that some age</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;was "the age of heroes" or some such nonsense, show me that /everyone/</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;on the planet at that time fit some definable profile.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  I'll do that after you show that all of those millions of species</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are perfectly adapted to their environment. See how easy it is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; attack straw men?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You mistinterpret my claim.  To be precise, it is (1) Evolution is</i><br>
<i>&gt;quantitative, testable, and falsifiable.  (2) Not one single fossil</i><br>
<i>&gt;falsifies it.  I did not claim that (3) every fossil /confirms/ it, </i><br>
<i>&gt;or (4) that we understand how every feature of every species came</i><br>
<i>&gt;about.  Nor do I, or does evolution, claim that (5) every feature of</i><br>
<i>&gt;every species is an adaptation.  That's nonsense; any engineer knows</i><br>
<i>&gt;that mamy features of even the most carefully designed systems are</i><br>
<i>&gt;historical accidents.</i><br>
<p>
 I understood your claim about evolution perfectly well. What I don't<br>
understand are the standards you are applying to Strauss &amp; Howe's theory,<br>
which are either stricter than those you apply to the theory of evolution<br>
or else are standards which Strauss &amp; Howe's theory can, if correct, pass.<br>
 Of course it's much easier to attack creationism than to address my points.<br>
