Is there anything besides diet and exercise?<br>
Drugs are part of your diet <br>
and any action is an exercise of your will.<br>
Doing anything requires disipline.<br>
Very early in your life you had to learn how to use your muscles.<br>
Learn how to use your mind's willpower.<br>
A good beginning mental exercise <br>
is sitting absolutly still for at least 5 minutes.<br>
Relax and do not try to breathe much.<br>
Do not try to think.<br>
At first it may seem uncomfortable <br>
but think about how long you stay still when you are asleep!<br>
If you have trouble doing these things think about inertia.<br>
If it becomes a part of your life <br>
it will stay a part of your life <br>
(or at least part of your neural programming).<br>
I suggest reading about meditation, <br>
even though it's as simple as sittinng and thinking.<br>
Control your mind and body, <br>
do not let it control you.<br>
