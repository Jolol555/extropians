<i>&gt;&gt;   The period of research into the cause of AIDS which considered both </i><br>

<i>&gt;That is not correct.  It was published in 1983 not 1984 in _Science_ (the</i><br>

<p>
In 1983, Gallo published a paper in Science in which he claimed that a<br>
retrovirus called HTLV-I caused AIDS [Gallo, R.C., P.S. Sarin, E.P.<br>
Gelmann, M. Robert-Guroff, and E. Richardson.  Isolation of human<br>
T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).<br>
Science 220 (1983): 865-867.].<br>
<p>
In 1984, under dubious cicumstances, he took credit for isolating a <br>
retrovirus he called HTLV-III from a number of AIDS patients.  This virus <br>
was later renamed the HIV virus.  His paper claiming this virus as the cause <br>
of AIDS was published in April of 1984 in Science [Gallo, R.C., <br>
S.Z. Saladhuddin, M. Papovic, G.M. Shearer, M. Kaplan, B.F. Haynes, <br>
T.J. Palker, R. Redfield, J. Oleske, B. Safai, G. White, P. Foster, and <br>
P. D. Markham. Frequent detection and isolation of cytopathic retrovirus <br>
(HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and at risk for AIDS. Science 224 ]<br>
(1984): 500-503.]<br>
<p>
More than one week BEFORE the publication of the paper claiming that <br>
the virus later renamed HIV causes AIDS was published in Science, <br>
Gallo's and his employer, the Department of Health and Human Services, <br>
sponsored a hugely attended press conferences at which Margaret Heckler <br>
declared this new virus was the probable cause of AIDS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How convenient to forget this.</i><br>
<p>
How convient to substitute a paper on another virus for the one we are<br>
talking about.<br>
