My original statement:<br>
<i>&gt;My response is, as always, "Insufficient Data".  I acknowledge that</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are major, evolved, emotional differences between the sexes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;although not necessarily ones that could not be overcome by upbringing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, I seem to recall running through several case histories of</i><br>
<i>&gt;feminized boys and androgenized women, some of which were (as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt;known) upbringing-induced and not a testosterone imbanance.</i><br>
<p>
[Kathryn Aegis opens fire:]<br>
<i>&gt; Your above statement is one of the most unlearned, unsubstantiated, out-moded </i><br>
<i>&gt; bits of tripe I've read in a long time, and I would thank you in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; future to actually cite these studies you claim to have read.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not quite sure what you objected to... but anyway, here's my source:<br>
<p>
Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, Fourth Edition:<br>
Section 23.1: "Gender Identity Disorders in Children and Adults"<br>
<p>
"Experts speculate that this degree of feminine behavior [on the part of<br>
a male<br>
 child] must be the result of genetic, hormonal, central nervous system<br>
 factors; however, no evidence to support this speculation has been<br>
reported<br>
 in humans.  In fact, no complete reversal of sex-related behavior is<br>
found<br>
 even in anatomically intact animals, except in the laboratory. [?] The<br>
only<br>
 biological contribution that is presently known is the boys' beauty and<br>
grace,<br>
 and very few beautiful boys become transsexuals."<br>
<p>
If Kathryn Aegis was objecting to my statement of "evolved emotional<br>
differences" [though, as stated, far from irrevocable ones], I again<br>
simply note that women in Western cultures are more choosy when it comes<br>
to mates.  So is the female of just about every known species except for<br>
some variety of fish in which the males raise the children.  In this<br>
species, the females display and the males choose.  The greater the<br>
parental investment, the choosier the parent.  This is simply the<br>
default emotion; what a given sentient female chooses to do about it is<br>
her business.  Emotions can be overridden by culture, sentient whim or<br>
even random chance.<br>
<p>
I ran across this particular example in either "Man:  The Moral Animal",<br>
"The Red Queen's Race", or "Sociobiology", in order of probability. <br>
Having none of these books in front of me, I can't provide page<br>
numbers.  I agree with these books that the evolutionary logic of<br>
[default] male promiscuity and [DEFAULT!] female selectiveness seems<br>
logically airtight, historically accurate, emotionally plausible, and<br>
supported by primate studies.<br>
