I think there is something to this idea. The more divergent lines of<br>
thought you can bring to bear on a problem, the more likely it<br>
is that you will come up with something original. The "foul up" you<br>
describe could be greater overlap or intersection between different areas<br>
of the brain that are normally confined to carrying out very specific<br>
tasks ( these overlaps can often generate a lot of noise and nonsense as<br>
well as creativity). For example, enhanced information transfer along the<br>
corpus callosum which connects the two lobes of the brain, is said to<br>
stimulate creativity.<br>
