<i>&gt;First of all, it seems that the variety of predators of pre-humans was less</i><br>

<p>
Far less, i looked up the data on the hyenids (civet/hyena/catlike<br>
ancestors) in the mid to late myocene, and it not only shows that they were<br>
FOX sized, but that they very probably didn't hunt in packs !!! (as they<br>
were still more civet like than Hyeanid) In fact the only really big<br>
predators around 4 mln years ago, except some smaller versions of what was<br>
to become the sabertooths (america only) were all Aquatic ! The dog-bear<br>
species were small, and inhabited only the arctic regions.<br>
<p>
This leaves Acinonyx (a small dumb, solitary hunting cheetah) as the only<br>
real possible threath to LATE Afarensis.<br>
<p>
Furtermore the civet like ancestors of the cats in the miocene were all<br>
small. Note that mamal records from the miocene to modern day are good to<br>
excellent !<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I assume that the predators had relatively lesser</i><br>

<i>&gt;pre-human's defensive capabilities were pretty pathetic...though it depends</i><br>

<i>&gt;smilodons about, perhaps the pre-human could jump into a tree...pending that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the smilodon wouldn't follow.  But since I'm not sure about the type of</i><br>
<i>&gt;predators around that era, I'll go on to the crux of my post.</i><br>
<p>
smilodon only lived in america, acinonyx was a cheetah like species that<br>
only fully developed 2 million years after lucy and was nowhere near as<br>
bright as modern day cheetah (smilodon was plain stupid compared to modern<br>
cats) Acinonyx was therefore matched against a species of Afarensis 2/3rds<br>
of the way from Lucys kind to becoming homo habilis (using tools).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;        Consider this scenario.  The pre-human was quite easy prey for many</i><br>
<i>&gt;predatory carnivores (whatever types they may have been).  </i><br>
<p>
There were none ! your scenario is best revised this way:<br>
<p>
Afarensis therefore, had probably no real predator, as acinonyx influence is<br>
at best doubtfull. Maybe the only real competition of importance to<br>
Afarensis (and pre-homonids in general) were ...other Afarensis /homonids!,<br>
This might explain the much faster evolution (intelligence increase, body<br>
size etc) of homonids compared to most other species. <br>
