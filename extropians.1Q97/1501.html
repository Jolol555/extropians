While I've nothing to offer directly relevant to the "Genius" thread, I <br>
think it is worth<br>
speaking up to recommend a book which brings together a lot of <br>
information on<br>
sex linked traits in humans.<br>
"The Red Queen" by Matt Ridley (1993), subtitled "Sex and the evolution <br>
of human<br>
nature", has quite a bit of information (and, more importantly, decent <br>
references)<br>
on the process by which developing brains (human and some other animals) <br>
are<br>
sensitised in the womb to respond in different ways to the hormones to <br>
which they<br>
get exposed later in life.<br>
<p>
As usual in developmental biology (:-)), it's nothing like as <br>
straighforward as it seems.<br>
However, it does seem that marked changes in behaviours that are often <br>
thought of<br>
as stereotypically sex linked in later life can be strongly influenced by <br>
small changes<br>
in hormone levels a a few very short (and very early) key stages of fetal <br>
development.<br>
<p>
The author was trained as a zoologist, but is better known as a <br>
journalist and a former<br>
editor of "The Economist". Worth a read, if perhaps not adding to the <br>
Extropian canon.<br>
His later work, "The Origin of Virtue", has interesting implications for <br>
some libertarian<br>
(and anti-liberatrian) arguments as well.<br>
