From: Dan Fabulich &lt;dfab@cinenet.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; I've recently taken interest in reading about hypertext, a decentralized</i><br>
<i>&gt; system for fine-grained bi-directional linking in writing.  For a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; description, read Drexler's "Hypertext Publishing and the Evolution of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Knowledge," which makes an effective argument for hypertext.</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.asiapac.com/Hypertext/HypertextPublishingKED.html">http://www.asiapac.com/Hypertext/HypertextPublishingKED.html</a></i><br>
<p>
If you look at <a href="http://www.foresight.org/WebEnhance/">http://www.foresight.org/WebEnhance/</a>, you can get info<br>
on Drexler's group's current project to try to bring about something with<br>
the flavor of his original proposal.  They are working with a system called<br>
HyperG (aka HyperWave) which allows bidirectional linking and some other<br>
capabilities.  I don't know how or if it deals with the retraction/revision<br>
problem though.<br>
<p>
The idea of using Usenet is interesting, although it's not clear to me that<br>
the Usenet model of flooding the world with postings is going to survive.<br>
The web approach of just linking your new data into existing structures seems<br>
so much more efficient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At this point, I'm despairing that a permanent decentralized hypertext</i><br>
<i>&gt; system can work in a free society.  If it's permanent, then it all must</i><br>
<i>&gt; be stored somewhere, and it will never be cost-effective to do so.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's decentralized, the system will drop unprofitable information and</i><br>
<i>&gt; may refuse to buy from most of the public.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any ideas?</i><br>
<p>
I'm surprised you didn't mention that, in fact, there are (so far)<br>
permanent, (somewhat) decentralized sources of Usenet postings.<br>
www.dejanews.com and www.altavista.digital.com are the two that I know<br>
of off the top of my head, and I think there are others.  It used to be<br>
that you could order CD-ROMs with all of Usenet for some date range,<br>
but I don't know if that is still the case.  These outfits apparently<br>
are able to fund themselves by means of advertising revenues.  The cost<br>
isn't really that high given today's cheap storage.<br>
<p>
So before getting all upset about this problem, consider whether the<br>
existing vendors have already solved it "good enough".<br>
