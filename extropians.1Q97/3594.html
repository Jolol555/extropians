<i>&gt; From: Lee Daniel Crocker </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What is thought to be a major breakthrough/development in cancer</i><br>
therapy<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has just been announced in the national Danish media. It should also</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; been published in "Nature Medicine" a renounced medical journal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is that a typo/mistranslation for "renowned", or a comment that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; study is less than rigourous? :-)</i><br>
<p>
It's a typo. I read english like a native, and speak it like an american<br>
;-) but I have some trouble writing it fluently.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The other word you were groping for is "mitosis" (cell division).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I won't correct all your spelling, but I did notice that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalized "German" but not "english".  Subliminal?</i><br>
<p>
Well Denmark has been in constant war with germany for about a thousand<br>
years except for the last 50 years. So maybee it's genetic. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway, thanks for the good news.  I remember hearing something about</i><br>
<i>&gt; this a few months ago, but perhaps that was hype to get funding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nice to know he actually got some results.  Does that mean that kids</i><br>
<i>&gt; "infected" by this cure will be required /not/ to stay home from</i><br>
<i>&gt; school so they can infect others?</i><br>
<p>
No the carrier virus should only affect the cancer cells. But who knows.<br>
Nature allways seem to have a way to fight back.<br>
