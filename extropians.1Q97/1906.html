This person has a serious problem, and I think that the levity involved<br>
is inappropriate until after the problem has been resolved.<br>
<p>
Now is the time for constructive contributions.<br>
<p>
I've made mine, in private email, with respect to the religious<br>
situation.  Now, about his worldly woes:<br>
<p>
Does anyone have any suggestions for what Mike Cowar can do if his<br>
parents do throw him out?  Charitable organizations that can shelter<br>
him, places to apply for jobs and/or Welfare while he tries to get back<br>
on track?  Legal organizations that can gain him access to his assets or<br>
protection from his parents?  Simply having a plan for the worst case<br>
might give him the confidence necessary to prevent it from happening. <br>
And IN the worst case, having a plan might save his life.  Does anyone<br>
have any advice?  Has anyone here been thrown out of their home by angry<br>
parents, and survived?  How?  What would you want to do differently?<br>
