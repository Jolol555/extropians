<i>&gt; Observe this [true] koan:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Eliezer was explaining the Meaning of Life to a novice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Really," he said, "I know the Meaning of Life."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "What is it?" asked the novice, who was skeptical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "It is -" began Eliezer, but suddenly sneezed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And the novice was enlightened.  In fact, she was enlightened so hard</i><br>
<i>&gt; she had trouble breathing.  And thus Eliezer knew he was a True Zen</i><br>
<i>&gt; Master.</i><br>
<p>
I love it, but it's a mondo, not a koan (some koans, like Joshu's "mu",<br>
come wrapped in mondos).  I'd love to collect or create a good set of<br>
modern American mondos and koans, because the traditional ones often<br>
depend on the culture of old Zen patriarchs more than is necessary. <br>
Especially the traditions of Buddhism, that Zen really has nothing to<br>
do with at its heart.<br>
<p>
Here's an American koan for you: Tell me, what is you car's<br>
destination, right now?<br>
