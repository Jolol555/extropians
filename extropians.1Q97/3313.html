<i>&gt;I am amazed and frightened by the strength of the reaction against</i><br>
<i>&gt;cloning.  No concrete scenarios of anyone being harmed by cloning are</i><br>
<i>&gt;being put forward!  All I've seen are complaints that people wanting</i><br>
<i>&gt;cloned kids must be selfish and/or weird.  Everyone agrees on this and</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagrees how concerns for this should weigh against the potential for</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical research.  I fear for the future of self-modification, at</i><br>
<i>&gt;least for a few decades.</i><br>
<p>
Look to generation X (even though i hate being labeled like that). The<br>
topic was brought up in my psychology class at El Camino College and people<br>
thought the idea of banning it was pointless. They said, we all know the US<br>
military wants to clone solders in secrecy and such and that people outside<br>
the country will do it anyways so it's inevitable. Putting that aside with<br>
acceptance they began to see the positive aspects of it such as cloning<br>
organs and such. When we get around to uploading to clones people may<br>
embrace the technology as a whole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S.  Yes, this sort of thing is predicted as we approach a "Fourth Turning."</i><br>
<p>
Grrrrrrrrrr! I hate that book!<br>
