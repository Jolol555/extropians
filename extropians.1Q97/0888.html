One of the advantages of bipedalism could be to look imposing, bears stand<br>
on their hind legs when they take on a defensive posture.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you can see a predator better by standing up high, it also means &gt;that</i><br>
the predator can see you better too, and because you're bipedal, &gt;the<br>
predator is a lot faster than you are. If you can't run away from &gt;danger a<br>
better strategy would be to hide and keep low.<br>
<p>
This itself would suggest that Australopithecus Afarensis was capable of<br>
defending himself against predators, as it seems unlikely that they had much<br>
higer reproduction rates, or much slower pregnancy times. Australopithecus<br>
Afarensis was succesful enough as a species to speciate numerous times,<br>
therefore it must have had some way of avoiding its predators.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But there were no spears, or tools of any sort at that time, ancestors</i><br>
<i>&gt;like Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) with their tiny, chimp sized &gt;brains</i><br>
were too dumb to make them. <br>
<p>
Correct me if i'm wrong, but there we're also no lions at the time of<br>
Autralopethicus Afarensis. Panthera Atrox had to deal with Homo Habilis, one<br>
who did use spears and tools. Any big cat that hunts alone, would think<br>
twice before attacking a group of Australopithicus or 'chimps', for that<br>
matter as they do throw rocks and stones !, rather he would single out one,<br>
sneak up and be gone before the rest had come to aid, and he'd still have to<br>
be pretty hungry to try.<br>
