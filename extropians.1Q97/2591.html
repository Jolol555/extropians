Since i came in contact with Transhuman and Extropian thought, the main<br>
problem i had in assimilating Participant Evolutionist theory into it, has<br>
without doubt been the eternal life question.<br>
<p>
Although seeking eternal life is a fine example of the individual seeking<br>
to escape the rules Nature has imposed upon humanity, and thus increasing<br>
the individuals control over his/her own destiny, i still have a few<br>
problems with some other possible motive.<br>
<p>
The quest for eternal life could also come from the natural instinct to<br>
stay alive no matter what. This i.m.o. is a very dangerous motive. As ones<br>
life itself is valued as the greatest possible good, many other aspects<br>
that are assumed to be naturally 'inherent' to that life, are taken for<br>
granted, and i hope we will not forget to improve the quality of that life,<br>
in the process of trying to extend it.<br>
<p>
To quote Aristotle: 'Certainly most men, in their desire to keep alive, are<br>
prepared to face a great deal of suffering, as if finding in life itself a<br>
certain well-being and a natural sweetness'<br>
<p>
0r a more radical one: 'Life has no ideals, it will do anything to survive<br>
!' (Arthur Byron Cover)<br>
<p>
Certainly there is truth in these words. When life itself is valued as the<br>
highest ideal, other ideals become secondary to it, and there might lie the<br>
basis for the success of the many opressive state systems we disussed in<br>
earlier threads.<br>
<p>
<p>
Self-sacrifice ethic.<br>
<p>
Now to continue where i left off in the socialist/capitalist discussion, i<br>
do see where ethics like that of self-sacrifice (understood that it's<br>
voluntary, and based on individual decisions), and that of 'the good of the<br>
many' etc, cannot be ignored in any rational system, nor should such ethics<br>
become valued as 'inferior' or 'obsolete'. Something to which i still have<br>
questions after the reactions on the last discussion.<br>
<p>
No political system can function without ideals and ethics that function<br>
like 'unwritten laws' by which a society lives together. <br>
<p>
My question then is: If in an anarcho-capitalist system, this main ideal<br>
becomes 'survival', then is there not the danger of it becoming the same<br>
hell to live in, as many of the other political systems we reject ? <br>
<p>
Are we then not simply replacing the exploitative system of a state or<br>
ruling power, by a system where we exploit eachothers fears of death, and<br>
desires for survival ? Or indeed our desires for accumulation of wealth to<br>
insure those...<br>
<p>
I myself have had no fear of death yet, and the only reason for myself i<br>
can imagine would be, if one day i would start a family, for whom i need to<br>
be 'around'. I find it hard to understand why anyone would stay alive for<br>
selfish reasons, but i assume there are many who would. <br>
<p>
My personal reason for striving towards a posthuman state is to eliminate<br>
the 'control' nature imposes on the living individual. To put that control<br>
(over my life, death, emotions) more into the hands of the individual.<br>
<p>
Maybe this clarifies my personal vision on some subjects we discussed.<br>
<p>
Any comments ?<br>
