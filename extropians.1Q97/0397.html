          There is some truth in this, but to me it sounds a little <br>
          too defeatist. I would rather suggest that we attack this <br>
          false sense of security directly, by informing people of the <br>
          dangers and persuading them to adopt realistic defences. <br>
          Even if the ban must ultimately break down, a delay in the <br>
          deployment of new dangerous technologies could give us the <br>
          time think out what could go wrong and to develop <br>
          appropriate countermeasures. Moreover, nobody knows what the <br>
          power balance between offence and offence will turn out to <br>
          be with e.g. nanotech warfare. It could be that the <br>
          advantage will always be on the side of the destructive <br>
          capacities, and in that case a ban is our only hope.<br>
          <br>
          As a clarification I should also say that I do not necessary <br>
          propose to prevent the development and use of very dangerous <br>
          technologies altogether, but only their use by are not <br>
          sufficiently responsible and careful. This does not mean <br>
          that the UN would be the only agent that could use this <br>
          technology, but it might mean that UN would have the mandate <br>
          to prevent rough nations, groups and individuals from <br>
          developing them.<br>
