        CORRECTION OF ERRORS IN AND AROUND <br>
        THE PIERRE SALINGER TWA 800 REPORT <br>
<p>
        Part I<br>
<p>
        by Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
        THE FOLLOWING are corrections of errors made by <br>
        major media in claims against the Pierre Salinger <br>
        TWA 800 report, and corrections of errors in the<br>
        report. I am a coauthor of the Salinger Report.<br>
<p>
<p>
        SALINGER REPORT MISQUOTE OF WITNESS<br>
<p>
        FBI agent James Kallstrom said "most witnesses" <br>
        interviewed by the Salinger investigative team deny <br>
        what the Salinger Report says they said [1]. The only <br>
        example of a witnesses claiming this that I've found <br>
        was cited in the New York Times [2] as follows:<br>
<p>
           [The Salinger Report] quotes Thomas Dougherty <br>
           of East Quogue, as saying, "My eyes were glued <br>
           to the TWA hitting the missile's flames."<br>
<p>
           But Tuesday, Dougherty said in an inter-<br>
           view that "I was misquoted" in the article. <br>
           He said that he saw what appeared to be a <br>
           flame streaking in the sky and an explosion, <br>
           but that he never saw a plane.<br>
<p>
        (Note that the only way a missile-witness will find<br>
        their way into the New York Times is if they can be <br>
        used to discredit the Navy-missile theory.)<br>
<p>
        Indeed, as he tells the Times, Mr. Dougherty told me <br>
        that he did NOT see the plane until after it was hit<br>
        and falling apart. I cannot account for the quotation <br>
        cited from the Salinger Report.  I should note that <br>
        the report was assembled by Pierre Salinger and Mike <br>
        Sommer and I cannot get hold of the final report as<br>
        I cannot locate Mr. Sommer and Mr. Salinger went on <br>
        a vacation right after the release of the report. <br>
<p>
        Clearly the quotation that the NY Times cites from <br>
        the Salinger Report is typographically flawed. What <br>
        the report should read is: "Mr. Dougherty's eyes were <br>
        glued to the flame that shot upwards and hit TWA 800." <br>
        What I've stated about Mr. Dougherty's eyewitness <br>
        account can be found on the Internet [3].<br>
<p>
        The portions of the Salinger Report that are derived <br>
        from my work -- hence my status as a coauthor -- are <br>
        derived from the carefully researched and referenced <br>
        reports I have posted publicly on the Internet [4].<br>
<p>
<p>
        SALT I VIOLATION ?<br>
<p>
        The Pierre Salinger TWA 800 Report suggests that an<br>
        accidental downing of TWA 800 with a missile by the<br>
        U.S. Navy could indicate a violation of SALT I arms-<br>
        control agreements,  and that such violation could <br>
        be an incentive for a cover-up. I, a coauthor of the <br>
        Salinger Report,  studied the SALT I ABM Treaty [5] <br>
        months ago and concluded that it is not a likely <br>
        incentive for the cover-up [6].<br>
<p>
        However, if the SM-2(IVA), which is an upper-tier<br>
        Standard Missile, was used, which Salinger and I<br>
        have proposed, then that would indeed violate the<br>
        SALT I ABM Treaty. <br>
<p>
        The Washington Times (03/13/97, A10) countered <br>
        the SALT I claim in the Salinger Report:<br>
<p>
            Mr. Salinger's claim the conventional <br>
            tactical missile used was one outlawed <br>
            by the first Strategic Arms Limitation <br>
            Treaty [SALT I] was disputed in Washington. <br>
            Arms Control Association Deputy Director <br>
            Jack Mendelsohn said, "SALT I dealt with <br>
            silos and nuclear missiles, and I have <br>
            no recollection of SALT I dealing with <br>
            any nonnuclear weapon like that."<br>
<p>
        Wrong: SALT I did deal with missiles that are not <br>
        necessarily nuclear. SALT I was a series of Strategic <br>
        Arms Limitation Talks between the USSR and the USA <br>
        that occurred between November 1969 to May 1972.  <br>
        During these talks the Treaty on the Limitation of <br>
        Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, also known as the <br>
        ABM Treaty, was drafted and later "entered into <br>
        force" on October, 3 1972 [7][5]. <br>
<p>
        The ABM Treaty placed limitations on the deployment <br>
        of anti-ballistic missiles -- any missile designed <br>
        to intercept nuclear-ballistic missiles -- and their<br>
        missile systems.  This limitation would render any <br>
        anti-ballistic missile, such as the nonnuclear SM-2<br>
        (IVA), fired or simply located off Long Island, a <br>
        violation of SALT I as the Salinger Report claims.<br>
<p>
        The ABM Treaty allows the United States to possess <br>
        anti-ballistic missiles, including their launchers <br>
        and radar systems, in only four locations: <br>
<p>
        1. 150 km around Washington D.C. [8] <br>
        2. 150 km around Grand Forks ICBM silo launcher [9]<br>
        3. White Sands, New Mexico, missile-test range [10]<br>
        4. Kwajalein Atoll missile-test range [10] <br>
<p>
        The 1974 ABM Protocol established further limits [11].<br>
<p>
        The areas near Long Island, where Navy missile activity <br>
        was not only scheduled but witnessed and photographed, <br>
        are outside the legal ABM zones. Therefore, the claim <br>
        implicit in the Salinger Report, that ABM deployment <br>
        off Long Island would violate SALT I, is correct.<br>
<p>
        I just spoke with Arms Control Association Deputy <br>
        Director Jack Mendelsohn, quoted in the Washington <br>
        Times above. He pointed out that he was not fully <br>
        aware of the exact claims in the Salinger Report he <br>
        was asked to address.  Mr. Mendelsohn agreed that <br>
        IF the SM-2(IVA) with Kinetic-Kill Vehicle was used <br>
        off Long Island (which the Salinger Report suggests) <br>
        then, in his opinion, that would indeed violate the <br>
        SALT I ABM Treaty. However, he does not believe the <br>
        SM-2(IVA) is deployable. There is evidence to the <br>
        contrary, although it is not decisive. <br>
<p>
        The Washington Times states that the Salinger<br>
        Report claims that the Continuous-Rod warhead is <br>
        outlawed by SALT I. That is not true: CR warheads<br>
        are anti-aircraft, not ABM, missiles. I don't know<br>
        how or why that claim was included in the report.<br>
<p>
        The portions of the Salinger Report that are derived <br>
        from my work -- hence my status as a coauthor -- are <br>
        derived from the carefully researched and referenced <br>
        reports I have posted publicly on the Internet [4].<br>
<p>
        I believe, in accord with the Salinger report and as<br>
        based upon my research, that the U.S. Navy accidently <br>
        shot-down TWA 800 during an exercise where a missile <br>
        missed its test target (a drone missile) and hit TWA <br>
        800 instead. The drone missile was then photographed <br>
        over Long Island flying out of military zone W-105 [12].<br>
