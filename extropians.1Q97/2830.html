With this message i'd like to apologize for being a newbie, i just joined<br>
another list which deals with a subject where i am somewhat of an 'old<br>
schooler', and now i completely understand what annoyance newbies can be<br>
sometimes.<br>
<p>
I'd like to note though that i am here to learn, and that i hope this is<br>
slowly starting to show in my postings. <br>
<p>
Thank you for your patience and i hope that the things i'm bringing up are<br>
becoming more interesting to the die hards. In other words: i hope that the<br>
trend is upwards. If it is not, please feel free to warn me.<br>
