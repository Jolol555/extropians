Fascinating.  I agree with almost everything you have to say...<br>
<p>
To clarify, however, I am not David Musick, nor am I my keyboard, my<br>
screen, or your e-mail.  I am [perceiving these things].  Why<br>
differentiate?  Because on some level, our definition stems equally<br>
from what we are and what we are NOT.  Our distinction becomes us.<br>
<p>
I would also argue that experience is not ALL of us.  There is even more<br>
than that.  While our experiences make up the majority of the<br>
philosophical "self," you can't deny the parts that don't contribute to<br>
that "self."  Pluck out a hair if you're interested.  You, on some<br>
level are [observing].  Part of you is also hair.<br>
<p>
As far as the mechanics of explaining this process, I've made a feeble<br>
attempt at doing so by utilizing the verb "to be" and brackets.  The<br>
verb "to be" is the only verb in the English language which circumvents<br>
the chasm of subject/object, since the subject in a clause whose main<br>
verb is "to be" is also the object; they are reflexively interchangable.<br>
I am [listening to opera].  I am [thinking about your point].  I am<br>
[remembering a rainbow].  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are ephemeral, transient patterns, rising from other patterns and flowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; on to become something else.  From moment to moment, experiencing the reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we are.  We are this; This Very Moment.</i><br>
<p>
There's another interesting point here, however, and that is the premise<br>
that immortality would be unachievable, as we are ever-changing, ever-<br>
growing, and ever-dying.  That needn't be the case.  Uploading yourself<br>
could put a halt to this process, if your "self-image" is never<br>
activated.  You could exist on file for centuries.  As immortality<br>
goes, that's not much to look forward to, but I rankle at the<br>
suggestion that immortality is IMPOSSIBLE...  Even in the philosophical<br>
sense, it is POSSIBLE, if undesirable.<br>
