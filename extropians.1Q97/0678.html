<i>                &gt;&gt;John:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;I agree, it has nothing to do with intelligence or Free Will</i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;or religion. So what's your point?</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Eliezer:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;Exactly.  Double dissociation.  Noncomputable != religious;</i><br>
<i>                &gt;you can have computable souls or noncomputable minds.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Hold on there partner. The "it" in my quote above refers to randomness. <br>
Things either happen because of cause and effect or they don't and if they <br>
don't then they are by definition random, but happenstance is the very <br>
opposite of intelligence and even emotion. That is why I said it had nothing<br>
to do with intelligence or religion.<br>
<p>
You're making A HUGE unjustified leap in logic, that If an atom is acting in<br>
a truly random manner that proves there is a Super Turing Machine inside,<br>
engaged in a Noncomputable but logical process telling the atom what to do.<br>
In truth, if a atom is acting in a truly random manner it means that there is<br>
absolutely no reason why the atom does what it does. After all, there is no<br>
logical reason to think that for every event there must be a cause and it<br>
must come before the event in a time sequence. You could even make a case<br>
that logic would prefer some things not  have a cause, infinite regression<br>
sometimes makes logic a little queasy.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if there really is a super Turing Machine inside an atom<br>
telling it what to do, it would be very hard for us to distinguish it from<br>
true randomness. Even so, digital information would still be the essence of <br>
what you and I are, because that determines how those super Turing Machines<br>
(atoms) are connected to each other, and if there is one thing we know with<br>
absolute experimental certainty it is that the position of atoms in the brain<br>
can change consciousness. Both drugs and a bullet in the head can change the<br>
arrangement of those atoms in the brain and both can also without a doubt<br>
change consciousness.<br>
<p>
One question: If we have all these trillions of little Super Turing Machines<br>
in our brain, how come we can't solve at least one of the many well known<br>
NP complete problems in polynomial time? Seems like it should be easy.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I don't share your pessimism; you seem to think that anything </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Noncomputable is never going to be explained </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
If an event does not have a cause there is nothing to explain.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;it seems to me that noncomputable things exerting causal </i><br>
<i>                &gt;influences on our Universe are part of the "laws of physics" </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and can thus be examined by the tools of science.  </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
If an event does not have a cause there is nothing to examine.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;"bits" really aren't well-defined at all.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It gives me fits, it's the pits, when people pick nits in the definition of<br>
bits. Sorry.<br>
<p>
Flaws can be found in any definition but bits are as well-defined as anything<br>
in human knowledge, and one hell of a lot better defined than the "The Soul"<br>
or "God". Besides, good definitions are always nice to have but are grossly<br>
overrated.        <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;Can you demonstrate that noncomputability has any religious </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;implications </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
I will try to be as precise as I can in this rather murky area.<br>
Non-computability in the quantum world has already been demonstrated, at  <br>
least to my satisfaction, it has few if any religious implications.<br>
Non-computability has not been demonstrated in the working's of the human <br>
mind but it seems likely to me that at least to  some it extent it exists,<br>
but only in the form of randomness so again, it has few if any religious <br>
implications.<br>
<p>
I would be very surprised if there was something like a Super Turing Machine<br>
in an atom, like something that had more than a countable infinite,<br>
(the number of integers) number of squares on its tape,  something that<br>
had a larger infinite number of squares to work with, like the number of<br>
Real numbers. A real brain or computer or Super Turing machine is<br>
not an abstraction but an object made of physical parts. So far nobody has <br>
found a countable infinite number of any physical object, and that is the <br>
smallest infinite number. If nature could find an even larger infinite number <br>
of physical parts, fit them inside an atom, and then organize them into<br>
a sort of machine, that would be incredible, I would be astounded but I don't<br>
think I'd join a monastery because you WOULD still have something complex<br>
doing complex things, logic could still help you figure things out.<br>
<p>
What would make me shave my head and put on my saffron robes is if something<br>
simple and had no parts could produce something as complex and glorious as<br>
consciousness or even intelligence. I'm willing to accept the Bit and<br>
Induction as axioms, but I draw the line at consciousness, it would mean that<br>
science could not help us in the one area that was most interesting to every<br>
one of us. Science would be like plumbing, useful at times but dull as<br>
dishwater.        <br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;can you specifically demonstrate that anyone claiming </i><br>
<i>                &gt;noncomputability for the mind does so from religious reasons </i><br>
<i>                &gt;which override rationality to the point that their argument </i><br>
<i>                &gt;need not be considered?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No. I'll consider anything and I do my best to take a person's argument at<br>
face value and not play amateur Sigmund Freud and try to guess why the people<br>
I  debate have the views they do. I hope others act the same with me.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;it seems to me that any computational account of the </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Universe requires a God to "breathe fire into the equations </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and make them live" [Hawking].  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Hawking is very well known for his uncompromising atheism, I can't help but <br>
think you're taking that quote out of context. By the way, this sounds like a<br>
pyramid scheme to me, who is going to breathe fire into god and make him live?<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Care to explain to me how *one* particular Turing  machine, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and not all the others, can spontaneously come into </i><br>
<i>                &gt;existence?</i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
I can not explain it, nor can I explain why there is something rather than<br>
nothing and if the God hypothesis could explain it then the only logical<br>
thing for me to do would be to become a holly roller, but it can not. If God<br>
does exist I'm quite sure She's pondering this question too.<br>
