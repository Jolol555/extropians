<i> &gt;Check out my post if you haven't yet!</i><br>

Yes. What you said in that post about David Musick paying attention to<br>
and matching the Fourier spaces of his devout Christian audience seems<br>
right on the mark. I mostly got this stuff from wondering what Nietzsche<br>
was going on about with his lauded method of "perspectivism". I suspect<br>
that what we are talking about now is something close to what he was<br>
talking about.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Perhaps the one thing we most have to teach ourselves is the</i><br>
<i> &gt;meta-memetic skill of how to shift through Fourier spaces in</i><br>
<i> &gt;search of the comprehensibility needed for any given moment.</i><br>
<p>
I'm working on it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;That opposites like this can both be comprehensible is a no-brainer</i><br>
<i> &gt;for a brain that operates by shifting though Fourier spaces.  What</i><br>
<i> &gt;is intuitively obvious in one space, would in a sufficiently dif-</i><br>
<i> &gt;ferent space not simply be wrong, but complete nonsense.  But by</i><br>
<i> &gt;doing this in a general way, we none the less have at least some</i><br>
<i> &gt;ability to bounce back and forth between these spaces.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Unfortunately, this leaves traditional logic, with its valuable<br>
refusal to tolerate contradiction, out in the cold. The amazing<br>
thing is that there is one *incredibly* powerful perspective<br>
(developed mostly by a few ancient Greeks and postmedieval Europeans,<br>
mostly men) built around noncontradiction and the scientific method,<br>
which one hardly ever needs to shift out of at all when dealing<br>
with non-persons. But this huge incredibly powerful perspective of<br>
physical science gives no value guidance whatsoever:  it leads to<br>
something like Spock syndrome or Hinayana Buddhism (the<br>
stepping-off-the-wheel variety of Buddhism... *not* my trip). Once<br>
you start tossing in a bunch of different value-centered Fourier<br>
spaces (necessary for dealing with persons productively) things<br>
get messy fast. They get especially messy-looking to the people<br>
who have grown up within and never learned how to leave the<br>
value-neutral physical science model. (Actually, I don't think such<br>
people exist. Such a person would be the epitome, the extreme, of<br>
what is actually a mere tendency that I'm describing.)<br>
<p>
Anyway, these are just thoughts.<br>
