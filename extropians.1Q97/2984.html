<i>&gt; &gt;Imagine each individual as an op-amp.  Those who are wealthy</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;become more wealthy (extraordinary stupidity can change that, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm talking about a tendency, not an outcome that is certain in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;every case), while those below that threshold will tend to lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ground.  The further you are from either side of that threshold, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;less likely it is that you can cross it by your intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;effort alone (or lack thereof, in the case of crossing the threshold</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in the negative direction).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which is why equal chances in education are so important. And which is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; why a zero starting position like Michael Suggests may not work, and where</i><br>
<i>&gt; a starting situation that lies on that fuzzy treshold might. Problem is you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't accomplish something like that without redistributing wealth. Young</i><br>
<i>&gt; adults have no wealth, and are therefore all by definition under that</i><br>
<i>&gt; level. Taking money away from their parents is an option, but what the hell</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the justification for such a system ?</i><br>
<p>
Well, if we go by American Constitutional standards, we are entitled to<br>
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Getting a free trust fund<br>
from daddy kind of deprives one of the right to pursue happiness, don't<br>
you think? There is not right to take it with you, and with estate taxes<br>
in the order of 50% here in the US, the highest rate of any tax here in<br>
the US, with little political opposition to it (compared to the much<br>
lower capital gains tax at 36% which is the political gadfly of<br>
Republican politics), there seems to be little opposition to the<br>
proposition that your kids don't have that much of a right to it either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Seeing the benefit that any productive individual contributes to the rest</i><br>
<i>&gt; of us, i view the loss of such an individual and his possible contribution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a loss to society. On that basis i feel the rest of us should feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'responsible' to some degree for that individuals chances for success.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Besides providing education, theres the ethical question of not letting</i><br>
<i>&gt; people starve to death, which i feel is a moral responsability, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldn't go much further than food and shelter. (i'm not quite out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; medication part, as illness is not societies fault in any way, should it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's moral responsability ? I like to think it is, but i haven't found a</i><br>
<i>&gt; justification for it yet)</i><br>
<p>
Communicable diseases require a community present to become pandemic.<br>
Diseases like TB, smallpox, etc. have traditionally been a community<br>
problem simply because they can reach epidemic proportions, so while<br>
innoculations may seem socializable, treatment for cigarette induced<br>
emphysema is not. What health threats are community problems and what<br>
ones are individual problems? Therin lies the difference.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the positive characteristics of a free market is that it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; boost economic growth enourmously, and the effects of even a growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; imbalance, would diminish greatly. The way i see it conditions for this are</i><br>
<i>&gt; a guaranteed coninued economic growth, population growth (educated) , and</i><br>
<i>&gt; (continued) human expansion beyond it's current habitat (space- colonialism</i><br>
<i>&gt; ?). One flaw in the system that halts this (like a limit ?), and the walls</i><br>
<i>&gt; come crumbling down though. That's when we need the alternatives you (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; i) proposed, or preferably built in security measures that deal effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and coordinated, but exclusively for this) with crisis situations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Put aside your distaste for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;taxation for a moment and contemplate the outcome of this:  A 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;post-mortem tax, but no other.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I proposed it myself a few weeks back (in the thread that lead to a thread,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that lead to this one), toyed with the idea, allthough not as radically as</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have. And came to this conclusion:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Why should the individuals power over his worldly posessions or his</i><br>
<i>&gt; property end at death ? The individual is the one that aquired it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldn't he be the one to decide what happens to it ?</i><br>
<p>
That individuals were smart enough to earn those assets implies a level<br>
of intelligence to wisely dispose of that wealth upon death, but such is<br>
not that case with much wealth that is inherited, and thus, not earned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One great thing about extropianism and transhumanist movements is that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; tends to reject the powers nature (and all other) holds over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual. Should it not be a beautiful thing for that rejection to</i><br>
<i>&gt; include the loss of the power over ones property at death ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Extropianism pursues eternal life and life extension, viewed not only in</i><br>
<i>&gt; this light, but also in the light of an ever increasing population growth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the system you propose would be like throwing water on a hot plate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Allthough i do not agree that everything proposed (yet) for a free market</i><br>
<i>&gt; system will work, i have come to the realization that any solutions for</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems left unanswered, must come from, or be adapted to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; background, the same set of ideas and laws, that are inherent to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, as much as possible, in order for it to work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finding solutions, and proposing to implement them in ways that directly</i><br>
<i>&gt; oppose the basis of such a system, has been my initial (and  occasionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; still repeated) error as well.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a proposal that links in with the clone thread: ANy individual<br>
has a right to the sanctity of his or her own genetic coding, but is<br>
also legally and financially responsible for any liabilities incurred in<br>
the dissemination of said genetic coding. THis brings in a concept that<br>
one must be able to afford the reproduction of one's coding, from not<br>
only birth, but to adulthood. Reproduction becomes a long term<br>
investment (30-40 years to maturity) that one can not collect on.<br>
<p>
of course, this is a politically impossible scenario, as the vast<br>
majority of people having kids cannot rationally afford to have them<br>
when they do, adn would go on the warpath against anyone trying to<br>
interfere with their right to reproduce. But think about it. Just as one<br>
must demonstrate financial responsibility to drive a car in most states<br>
(insurance), people should have to demostrate financial responsibility<br>
to have kids. <br>
