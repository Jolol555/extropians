Reilly,<br>

<i>&gt;     If, on the other hand, archetypes are turned away from</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth, then "each system of archetypes will define its own mutually</i><br>
<i>&gt; incompatible logic."  Systems of archetypes that are turned away from truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; can still have the appearance of rationality to those who subscribe to</i><br>
<i>&gt; coherence theories of truth (the Quinian stance), though not the reality of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationality. </i><br>
<p>
This is a very good point.  Nothing stops the data in any given space from<br>
simply being wrong.  If the data's wrong, changing the space isn't going to<br>
help matters; no panacea here.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;The genius of Feynman was often attributed to the fact that in the middle</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a difficult problem, he would stop what he was doing and suddenly shift</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a different viewpoint.&gt;</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Voila!  Sum-over-the-perspectives/sum-over-the-histories describes reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Russell (the positivists) and independently Edmund Husserl, were working</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this line at about the same time roughly a full generation before</i><br>
<i>&gt; Feynman's breakthroughs, but Sartre picked it up and spread it around more</i><br>
<i>&gt; contemporaneously.</i><br>
<p>
Strange that the very process that was responsible for the genius inside of<br>
Feynman's head was what led him to confirm in physical reality what these <br>
philosophers had been saying a generation before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Russell postulates a single space in which all the points of view or</i><br>
<i>&gt; perspectives are themselves located.  There are many actual private spaces,</i><br>
<i>&gt; an infinite number of possible ones, but only one public space or</i><br>
<i>&gt; perspective space which contains them all."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Only one perspective space" is the same idea as the space-time point</i><br>
<i>&gt; common to all events referred to in other recent posts, published the year</i><br>
<i>&gt; before Einstein's "General Relativity."</i><br>
<p>
Now we're getting to the subject of absolute truth which brings to mind <br>
the interesting question as to whether any mathematician has ever made any<br>
headway in defining and using a generalized mathematical space which would<br>
include all Fourier spaces?  I'd be suprised if someone has done this.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I am not sure how generalized the set of Fourier spaces is that we operate</i><br>
<i>&gt; within.  Evolutionarily, we should expect that the overall set should not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be very large, because we haven't been subjected to an excessively mutable</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment in our brief history.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Only seven sets!  The tests are only beginning, but I would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; surprised if we turn out to be operating in many diverse patterns, our</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment does not present us with utter chaos, rather with temporally</i><br>
<i>&gt; stable packages of constraints.</i><br>
<p>
This is an excellent point.  I mentioned that evolutionary psychology would<br>
constrain the generality of the process, but frankly I'm suprised to see <br>
that it is so limited.  In any case, I agree that our evolutionary past <br>
would highly bias the states we experience in favor of those that played a<br>
large role in our genetic and memetic past.  When I said generalized, I <br>
meant generalized in principle by the fact that our brains have hardware<br>
that operates in conjugate waveform spaces, but meant that to be limited<br>
by my later discussion which talked about constraints in the process.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;This is next leads us into the problem of "archetypal rationality".  For</i><br>
<i>&gt; small problems, holding a few dozen Fourier spaces in ones head simultan-</i><br>
<i>&gt; eously, and picking an answer from some suitably localized one is no big</i><br>
<i>&gt; deal, but as the problems get larger and larger, our ability to hold simul-</i><br>
<i>&gt; taneous viewpoints decreases accordingly.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is quite an apt description of how my thought processes work, I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; this huge ball of working concepts gyrating throughout many frameworks of</i><br>
<i>&gt; structured dormant concepts, performing inter-Fourier-spatial translations</i><br>
<i>&gt; and intra-Fourier-spatial recognitions.  The problem sets in play at any</i><br>
<i>&gt; one time dictate the viscosity and diffusion of the working concepts</i><br>
<i>&gt; throughout the whole mess.</i><br>
<p>
And the pathways between the varying spaces could well have varying degrees<br>
of constriction/resistance.  Strange, how in the purely abstract realm of <br>
memetics and cognitive process, that this gives us such a remarkably strong<br>
basis for applying the metaphors of fluid dynamics in such a meaningful way.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Technically, it is not the case that "as the problem sets get larger and</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger, our ability to hold simultaneous viewpoints decreases," it is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; old uncertainty principle at work, or the depth vs. breadth nonsimultaneity</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle.  No brain, no matter what its capacity, can escape the physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; constraints (really the linear temporal constraint) of what David Gelernter</i><br>
<i>&gt; referred to as the "spectrum of focus," that sliding scale of attention</i><br>
<i>&gt; from high-focus analytic to mid-focus emotional to low-focus associative</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagination.  Any thought, no matter how potent the intelligence is, will</i><br>
<i>&gt; land at only one point on this attention scale at any moment in time.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; superintelligence that could plunge to an incredible analytical depth of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem would be a high-falutin' geek; that could spread to an incredible</i><br>
<i>&gt; imaginative breadth of a problem would be a hepped-up mystic.</i><br>
<p>
Your right about this being a generalized uncertainty principle at work, but<br>
when I talked about holding simultaneous viewpoints for small problems, I was<br>
proposing that the brain might operate in an explicitly parallel mode that<br>
simultaneously holds a number opposing viewpoints with mediocre precision.<br>
For larger problems, it would be exactly as you say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;Along this line, brain plasticity may well function by simply reinforcing</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain Fourier spaces at the expense of the general set.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you mean just the opposite of this, brain plasticity, which is at</i><br>
<i>&gt; maximum levels in utero and in infancy, is more closely related to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; general set.  The process of reinforcing certain spaces describes not brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; plasticity, but brain sludge.  Evolutionarily, brain sludge enhances the</i><br>
<i>&gt; potential for preservation if the environment is not changing too rapidly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain plasticity is preferable only in chaotic environments.</i><br>
<p>
By brain plasticity, I meant the ability to engage in moment to moment brain<br>
plasticity in the here and now as we learn new stuff.  You're very right in<br>
calling it brain sludge if it's something that shaped us in the past that<br>
can't be changed now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;Each Fourier space has, quite simply, its own logic.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is an important consideration, the nature of knowledge systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including scientific knowledge, is radically local.  It's why physicists</i><br>
<i>&gt; should never become biologists, or worse yet, neuroscientists.  It's why</i><br>
<i>&gt; mixing computer and human metaphors is so cludgy.  However, we must be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; careful not to fall into compost-modern relativism and get lost in pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; coherency theories of truth.  We must be aware that each Fourier space will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be turned towards or away from truth, that not all Fourier spaces are</i><br>
<i>&gt; created equal with respect to their utility for our preservation.</i><br>
<p>
This is something that I neglected to mention, but what you describe is a<br>
real problem.  I have a feeling that sooner or later some school of post-<br>
modern deconstructionist philosophers is going to have a field day using<br>
something like this as a high-pressure fire hose to spew out more compost.<br>
On the other hand, compost can often make good fertilizer for new things<br>
to grow in.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;  Protein  folding stuff.<br>
<p>
Thanks for the interesting info.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;...the frequency component of this generalized Fourier processor is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited to the brain, but exists in all eukaryotic cells, thus easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; spilling over into the rest of the body (and possibly beyond the body).&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This would be helpful in explaining the increasingly well documented</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognitive experience of tacit knowledge and implicit perception.</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention the vast amount of inexplicable psychosomatic phenomena<br>
swirling around.  It may not explain everything, but mind-body interaction<br>
is loaded with intractable problems, of which one of the most blatant is <br>
the known ability for multiples to have differing allergen profiles.<br>
<p>
Or the often repeated martial arts claim that at sufficiently advanced <br>
levels, the learning is a whole body learning.  I remember Minsky ripping<br>
someone to shreds at the extro-2 conference for bringing this up during a<br>
Sat night Q&amp;A session, but it's very possible that Minsky might have been<br>
wrong on this, especially with regards to kinesthetic perception and maybe<br>
even with regards to ultra-fine muscle control.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;We may yet find that building efficient AI and upload capable devices</i><br>
<i>&gt; still</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires the use of at least some "wetware" as this meat in our bodies is</i><br>
<i>&gt; called.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If each Fourier space is discrete, then the boundaries between them must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; analog for jumping to occur.  Thus, I would agree with you that an upload</i><br>
<i>&gt; capable device must be a mix of digital and analog computers, most probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; in roughly the estimated 20% digital-80% analog mix of neurochemical</i><br>
<i>&gt; interactions we currently possess.  Perhaps it is four times more</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionarily important to jump boundaries than it is to settle into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fourier space.</i><br>
<p>
I find it amazing that so few of those interested in uploads are paying<br>
any attention to this lack of analog in proposed upload schemes.  <br>
Digital is nice, but this business of waveform families and their <br>
associate spaces is not in any way insignificant.<br>
