Absolutely.  I had a heart-warming experience today, when a woman's little<br>
boy was run down outside the cafe where she was drinking her morning coffee.<br>
As his blood ran into the gutter and he screamed for her help, she called<br>
crisply to him, `What's it worth, Billy?  Half your allowance?'  It was hard<br>
to hear his bid because his throat was a mess, but I think they settled on<br>
two dollars.<br>
