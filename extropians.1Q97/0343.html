Aptitude, genius, intelligence, etc: none of these things can be<br>
defined explicitly and unambiguously enough for measurement. What<br>
can be measured is skill at a particular set of tasks, and it seems<br>
to be a pretty good hack to assume that skill at manipulating<br>
language and mathematics is a pretty good predictor of success<br>
within our current crop of academic institutions.<br>
<p>
But brains have many, many other skills besides the abilities to<br>
manipulate language and mathematics, and IMHO these other skills<br>
(collectively: every human talent and skill *other* than language<br>
and mathematics) have made heavy contributions to the achievements<br>
of the people whom *I* admire as geniuses. These other skills are not<br>
measured on the SAT.<br>
<p>
The dream of measuring intelligence is the dream of measuring<br>
generalizably-extrinsic Skill. I don't believe such a thing exists.<br>
We are each a bundle of different skills and aptitudes working together,<br>
including some freakish individual skills each of us has that are<br>
the result of a unique configuration of neurocomputational processes,<br>
and the more closely I study such things, the more laughable the<br>
notion of numerically measuring "general intelligence" as a single<br>
scalar quantity seems. It will be even *more* laughable in the era<br>
of Jupiter brains. Measuring general intelligence is like evaluating<br>
an entire economy, except that this economy is all barter, so we<br>
can't even do a summation of money prices of things. (And even if we <br>
could, the analogy to that in our brains might bear no relationship<br>
to what we think we mean by "general intelligence".)<br>
