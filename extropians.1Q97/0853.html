Well, all I was suggesting was that in order to become the best of of the<br>
best in *anything*, let alone *everything*, people usually have to make<br>
sacrifices, which can include personal relationships.<br>
<p>
Personally, I have never derived as much happiness as I would like from<br>
being the best at something, but maybe that is because of some flaw in my<br>
personality.<br>
<p>
I wish you great success in your multiple endeavors.<br>
