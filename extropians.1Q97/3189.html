I said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;HIV seems equally distributed between the sexes, yet males make up</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;almost 9 out of 10 AIDS cases. Paradoxical to the theory that HIV</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;causes AIDS.</i><br>
<p>
Steve Edwards, former virologist, said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You seem to think that the US is the only country with an AIDs problem.</i><br>
<p>
I never said that. I have pointed out that males make up roughly 9 out <br>
of 10 of the American and European AIDS cases. Where did I say that<br>
the US is the only country with an AIDS problem?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;AIDs is far more prevalent in Africa, where IV drugs are rarely used, and,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if you believe the Africans, homosexual behavior is less common.  In Africa,</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS is distributed equally between the sexes.  </i><br>
<p>
If you look at global data, AIDS looks like different epidemics.<br>
<p>
In the US and Europe AIDS is not evenly spread among the population, <br>
almost 90% of the patients being male. In Africa it is spread evenly among the <br>
population and the symptoms are completely different. <br>
<p>
If AIDS is caused by HIV, the ratio of infected to diseased carriers should <br>
be similar in different countries. In the US roughly 10% of 1 million HIV<br>
positives have developed AIDS since 1985. However in Uganda only 0.8% <br>
of 1 million, and in Zaire only 0.15% of 3 million HIV positives have developed <br>
AIDS. This indicates that the AIDS risk of infected Americans is 10-65 fold <br>
higher than Africans. If AIDS	equaled opportunistic infections resulting  <br>
from immunosupression, MORE, instead of less, AIDS per HIV carrier  <br>
should occur in Africa vs the US.	<br>
<p>
Also, all infected subjects should have the same risk of developing those  <br>
AIDS diseases that are not associated with group or region specific  parasites. <br>
53% of American AIDS patients have pneumocystis pneumonia and  <br>
13% candidiasis. 90% of the AIDS patients in Africa have slim disease,  <br>
fever, diarrhea, and tuberculosis but not pneumonia or candidiasis,  <br>
although the microbes that cause Pneumonia and candidiasis are <br>
ubiquitous  in humans, including Africans.<br>
<p>
Rather than being reassured that the statistical anomalies <br>
(for an  infectious disease) of American AIDS can be averaged out with <br>
data from  other countries, I wonder if the categorically different <br>
epidemiology is a function of their different causes. After all,<br>
a 50-50% distribution by sex vs a 90-10% distribution is as<br>
different as night and day, epidemiologically.<br>
<p>
In Africa, Duesberg identifies parasitic diseases, poor sanitation and <br>
malnutrition as the main causes of AIDS. In the US and Europe, he holds <br>
that toxic drugs or conventional clinical deficiencies and their treatments <br>
cause the indicator diseases of AIDS.<br>
<p>
This hypothesis resolves many of the paradoxes of the virus-AIDS dogma. <br>
1)The difference in the epidemiology of African vs American AIDS.<br>
2)The prevalence of AIDS in American males despite evidence that both <br>
males and females are equally infected by HIV.<br>
3)The vastly different AIDS diseases are caused by different pathogens, <br>
pathogenic conditions and their treatments.<br>
4)The fact that hemophiliacs have doubled their median age in the last <br>
10-15 years, while 75% of them have been infected with HIV  for almost 10 yrs.<br>
4)The long and unpredictable latent periods between infection by HIV <br>
and specific AIDS diseases are the product of functually unrelated events: <br>
the pathogenic events necessary to reach an individual's threshold for <br>
AIDS diseases, and infection by the marker HIV.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some persistent viruses can be dormant for years before</i><br>
<i>&gt;causing disease.   Herpes can cause disease only periodically even though</i><br>
<i>&gt;the patient is chronically infected.</i><br>
<p>
Herpes simplex virus can cause lesions even long after the first antibodies<br>
against the virus have been produced. But this can only happen if the virus <br>
is reactivated because the origianl antibodies and anti-viral T-cells have <br>
dropped below a safe threshold level.  After reactivation the virus multiplies <br>
into large numbers just as in the original infection. <br>
<p>
But herpes produces the same lesions upon first infecting the body as it does<br>
upon reactivation, and antibodies neutralize it both early and late. Herpes can<br>
only recur because it hides in certain cells, waiting until some future <br>
opportunity when the host's immune function is temporarily reduced. Once<br>
the immune system regains strength, the virus is again suppressed and the<br>
sores disappear. <br>
<p>
When herpes is causing lesions it is active and abundent and found in the <br>
diseased tissues.  HIV, on the other hand, only infects a tiny % of the T-cells<br>
while the immune system is being damaged. Herpes causes the<br>
same symptoms upon first infecting the body and upon reactivation. <br>
HIV is alleged to kill its host only years after being neutralized, and even <br>
without reactivating. Thus herpes is an inappropriate model for HIV/AIDS.  <br>
