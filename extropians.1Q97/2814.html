Hmm, yes, I would *like* to believe this, but isn't it sometimes the<br>
case that there can be a problem that nobody (except a few experts, say)<br>
*sees* as a problem (or nobody *wants* to see as a problem - say the<br>
presence of large numbers of automobiles, for instance), so nobody seeks<br>
a solution to the problem, so the market won't find one?  Isn't this the<br>
sort of thing Joost is talking about?<br>
<p>
I'm always torn by this question: do we admit that some people may be in<br>
a position to notice things most of us can't or won't, and do we grant<br>
them power to effect changes that would be beneficial to us all?  (Take<br>
a look at Mancur Olson's work, for instance, where he shows that  majority<br>
interests often gets shafted by better organised minority interests) <br>
Then you get into "Who watches the watchmen?" stuff - a *very* old and<br>
knotty problem.<br>
<p>
Or do we stick to the theoretical hardline and define that possibility<br>
away (as in the Misesian type of praxeological analysis, where wants are<br>
revealed only in actual market interactions, for example)? Ought we to do<br>
this for the sake of taking the moral high ground? (Then you get into<br>
debates about consequentialism!)<br>
<p>
(This is perhaps the modern equivalent of the old "we know what's best<br>
for you better than you do yourself" thing that socialists used to be so<br>
fond of.)<br>
<p>
I dunno.  Like Joost, I love the market, and value it highly, but can't<br>
avoid having some reservations. I like the logic of a-c arguments; but<br>
on the other hand, perhaps there is some kind of hidden wisdom (a la<br>
Hayek) in the idea that 'we' do need some sort of collective power on<br>
some occasions. Perhaps a-c is itself just another form of 'constructivist<br>
rationalism', as some anti-libertarians would argue!  <br>
<p>
(I think I would be comfortable with a collective organ, so long as it<br>
didn't itself break the law in its activities - the straight classical<br>
liberal position, I suppose.)<br>
