<i>&gt; &gt;} Here I also have to agree with the critics, at least when they refer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;} to people who expect remarkably rapid progress toward transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;} technologies in the next few decades.  This stuff will take a while to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Robots are cross-country drivers, runners, and janitors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; AI can follow a conversation better than some humans can.</i><br>
<p>
As an AI researcher, I have to respond to this.<br>
<p>
1. Robots are not cross-country drivers.  A few vehicles exist which<br>
can drive on a clearly-marked straightway on a bright sunny day at<br>
speeds of (last I heard) up to 50mph.  This is a far, far cry from<br>
being able to drive cross-country.<br>
<p>
2. Runners: There exist legged robots that don't fall down and<br>
don't (usually) run into things.  You can't tell them where to go<br>
and have them get there, as far as I know.  They operate on reflexes;<br>
they have no navigational ability.<br>
<p>
3. Janitors:  This is fiction.  You may have gotten the idea because<br>
the robot competitions at AAAI usually have a trashcan-finding competition,<br>
in which robots from different universities and research centers compete<br>
to successfully identify trashcans in an "office environment" (all walls<br>
same color, uniform lighting, no posters, nothing on the floor, no people).<br>
They do poorly.<br>
<p>
4. AI can follow a conversation better than some humans can:  Only if<br>
by "some humans" you mean people with severe brain damage or people who<br>
don't speak the language in question.  :)  Demos are deceiving.<br>
Most AI systems are designed to perform on a specific set of demos.<br>
Unfortunately, continued funding depends on impressing people who don't<br>
know anything about AI in a fifteen-minute presentation.  "Demo or die."<br>
This emphasizes appearances that are skin-deep over true advances.<br>
Never believe a demo until you read the source code.<br>
