If you don't pay the property tax on your house when Government tells you to,<br>
and you refuse to leave your house when Government tells you it now belongs<br>
to them, I guarantee you WILL see submachine guns at the door. Government will<br>
never give up, first they will try words, if that doesn't convince you they<br>
will try moderate violence, if you're still not convinced of the righteousness<br>
of the government's position then they will use more violence , they will do<br>
whatever it takes to win, up to and including a bullet in the brain.<br>

<i>                &gt;government comes into being?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of communicating your wishes, there are<br>
much better ways. Every day I send hundreds of exquisitely precise messages<br>
to the Free Market telling it what I want it to do. I also get to compare<br>
brands, I can't do that In a democracy because I'm not voting for goods or<br>
services or even policies, I just get to choose between two grab bags of<br>
promises every 4 years, and democracy is the best form of government,<br>
the best of a bad lot.<br>
 <br>
When I vote in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I always<br>
win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate,<br>
the chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not worth<br>
my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the politician<br>
with the better hairdo gets to make the decisions.<br>
                            <br>

<i>                &gt;choose representatives?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I am proposing Anarchy because History has shown that limited government does<br>
not stay limited for long. It seems to be in the fundamental nature of a state<br>
to increase it's power. By definition a state has power an individual or<br>
corporation does not have, it's inevitable that it will use that power,<br>
however small it starts out to be, to gain even more power, the process<br>
increases exponentially until people revolt. The lesson from history is clear,<br>
the only solution is to eliminate governments completely.<br>
