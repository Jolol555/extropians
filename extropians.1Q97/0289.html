David McFadzean:<br>
<i>&gt;I don't want to seem like I'm defending de Garis's views, but he doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagree with anything you have said. He says that if women have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;underrepresented historically because the Man has been keeping them down, </i><br>
<i>&gt;then we should have seen an increase in the proportion of female geniuses</i><br>
<i>&gt;in last 30 years. But he claims they still represent around 5%.</i><br>
<p>
Get me into a room with him and watch the fur fly!<br>
I'll try to be brief, just mention some points I would bring up:<br>
<p>
--Despite some very real progress in Western countries, women as a <br>
global whole are still systemically excluded from most academic fora, <br>
especially in the sciences.  Those that do get admitted to this fora find <br>
their work almost routinely ignored, discredited, dismissed.  (Some <br>
interesting court cases working their way through the U.S. system right <br>
now pertaining to academia)  As Simon Levy said to me over dinner two <br>
nights ago, academia for better or worse progresses much slower than <br>
other areas of society, and their resistance to women's contributions will <br>
take much longer to overcome.  <br>
<p>
--What measures and/or instruments is de Garis using to measure genius.  <br>
Is he relying on IQ scores, achievement, reputation?  I would love to see a <br>
breakdown of IQ scores by gender differential.  Is his sample size <br>
global in nature or is he focusing specifically on Western countries? <br>
<p>
--Having genius potential is one thing, having the opportunities and <br>
resources to develop it quite another.  Women in traditional societies <br>
face substantial barriers regarding leisure time, access to education, <br>
etc.  In industrial societies, it is only in the past decade that <br>
an examination has been undertaken of the effectiveness of <br>
educational systems in encouraging and promoting female students.<br>
<p>
--I would shift blame away from The Man or Men and focus on <br>
power/political/cultural systems and the way both males and females <br>
are trained from birth to follow different tracks and different modes <br>
of thinking.  It could very well be the case that female geniuses are <br>
expressing that genius ability in modes not presently valued.  If we <br>
accept the concept of different types of intelligence (creative, <br>
practical, computational, etc.) we might also accept the possibility <br>
of different types of geniuses.<br>
<p>
Hum, well, I think that's enough for now!<br>
