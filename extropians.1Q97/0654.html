<p>
Still many people who will go to such an event, will not 'get it' even when<br>
they do, because of difference in taste. I agree with it that people<br>
shouldn't judge a music they don't understand by the same standards they<br>
judge music they do understand, but i'm not going to do the same by saying<br>
that modern techno IS art. What i will say is that time will teach that<br>
todays techno will be considered as much ART, as previous music styles,<br>
which were condemded for not being art in their time.  <br>

No it isn't. It's his reality, it's my reality, and it's the reality of more<br>
than half of the european youth today. Many elements of which will be<br>
continued in mainstream culture for the next decades. Get used to it.<br>
