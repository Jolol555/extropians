Duh.  If assigning property rights was so easy in those domains, they'd<br>
probably have been claimed already.  What's a good oceanic solution?<br>
Squares or cubes of territory?  Not very useful.  Schools of fish?  That<br>
would be more useful, if you could track and identify schools.  I don't<br>
know how they behave; if two schools merged, life would be difficult.<br>

Alternately, one might want to make life under the state as unpleasant<br>

I'm feeling far more anarchist since reading Friedman essays last<br>
night.  Assuming all of his analysis is correct, the missing link of<br>
such advanced economics and game theory seems to be why gov'ts exist, if<br>
they're so nasty.  I have two ideas for possible proofs; one is that<br>
gov't is necessary for at least one function, such as group defense, and<br>
once the mechanism is established it spreads via public good problems.<br>
(Well, I doubt anything happened that particular way.  But it shows why<br>
we'd never have escaped.)  The other would be that we started with gov't<br>
for any reason you want, say as an outgrowth of tribalism, and escaping<br>
is a very hard public good/Schelling point problem.<br>
<p>
In case people are confused, my ideas have for years been a<br>
superposition of wanting to be an anarchist and doubting its<br>
feasibility.  So when I argue with an anarchist, I back minarchy, and<br>
when I argue with any statist, I back anarchy.  <br>
<p>
That's quantum philosophy. :)<br>

There's something in my garden, it's been there for a week.<br>
I tried to feed it crackers, but that only made it squeak.<br>
I tried to wash its scaly head, but all it did was cry,<br>
So I think I'll put it back to bed, and sing it a lullaby:<br>
A monster's lullaby:<br>
