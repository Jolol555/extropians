Eric,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes. Unfortunately, this leaves traditional logic, with its valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; refusal to tolerate contradiction, out in the cold. The amazing</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing is that there is one *incredibly* powerful perspective</i><br>
<i>&gt; (developed mostly by a few ancient Greeks and postmedieval Europeans,</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly men) built around noncontradiction and the scientific method,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which one hardly ever needs to shift out of at all when dealing</i><br>
<i>&gt; with non-persons. </i><br>
<p>
Maybe not so amazing when we realize that this European logic, is so<br>
powerful because for the first time the human race finally captured<br>
the essential logic of the particular Fourier space that our bodies<br>
are localized in.  The Cartesian coordinate system IS, after all, the<br>
coordinate system that captures localization within this Fourier space.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But this huge incredibly powerful perspective of</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical science gives no value guidance whatsoever:  it leads to</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like Spock syndrome or Hinayana Buddhism (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; stepping-off-the-wheel variety of Buddhism... *not* my trip).</i><br>
<p>
That's the problem, what we are familiar with in our formal logic<br>
is simply too narrow to capture the fullness of reality.  But<br>
hopefully a recognition of its limits might lead us to broaden <br>
our horizons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Once</i><br>
<i>&gt; you start tossing in a bunch of different value-centered Fourier</i><br>
<i>&gt; spaces (necessary for dealing with persons productively) things</i><br>
<i>&gt; get messy fast. They get especially messy-looking to the people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who have grown up within and never learned how to leave the</i><br>
<i>&gt; value-neutral physical science model. </i><br>
<p>
A messyness that is compounded by people promoting alternative <br>
logics and cultural relativism without any regard whatsoever <br>
for the truth.  This is what it all boils down to, do we have<br>
a committment to speak the best truth we can when bouncing<br>
around from viewpoint to viewpoint.<br>
