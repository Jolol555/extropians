I've had the same thought, and called it social inertia.  It's why I<br>
think the Singularity will not happen.  Something interesting will<br>
happen, certainly.  But it will not involve more than a small fraction<br>
of the population, because most people don't *like* change.<br>
<p>
So, a few people will transform themselves, then a few more, then a<br>
lot more - but it will be gradual: not a Singularity.<br>
