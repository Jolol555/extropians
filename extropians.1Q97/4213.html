<i>&gt;&gt;    Lest you think I jest, let me explain that what I am about to tell</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is fairly easy to verify and document, and is not based on vague</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; allusions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to some psychic vibrations from the comet, which seem to be rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; commonplace lately.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    In the early 1970's there was a small group in Canada, known as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Bartonian Metaphysical Society.  The group was joined by an individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; named C.J. Parker, who had just had his first experience of "the end of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the world" as a member of Herbert W. Armstrong's Worldwide Church</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     Parker became a teacher and leader in the group, which soon became</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the Institute for Applied Metaphysics, with metaphysical retreats in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec.  There were often UFO reports</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; surrounding the dates of their intensive seminars in Eastern Canada,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which received press coverage, I believe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker was involved, according to both himself and many others,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the founding of the New Covenant Club during his involvement</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with IAM.  This was centered around the belief that the "old</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; covenant" with God, which involved circumcision, had now been</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; replaced with a "new covenant," which involved vasectomies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Later, some of the Eastern leaders began indicating that if</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; vasectomies were a good way of indicating one's dedication to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; spirituality in the end-times, then castration was even better.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     Parker was soon involved in a second "end of the world" when</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Winifred Barton made her prediction in the mid-to-late 1970's.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; After her prediction appeared (to some) not to come true, then many</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; left the group and quite a few migrated to other groups, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the Solar Temple.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker migrated to Texas, where he was involved in the music</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; business, and in running clubs for mob interests.  He managed clubs</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in Waco and Killeen, Texas, where he apparently became involved</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with David Koresh, although that might have been at a later date.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     He was arrested and convicted in Bell County, Texas for assault</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on police officers there, sometime around 1980.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     Parker became a recording artist and soon afterward moved</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to Tucson, Arizona, where he continued to dabble in music and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; metaphysics, travelling across the SouthWestern U.S., as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; up and down the west coast.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    He started a computer company in Tucson, called "Pearl Harbor</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Computers," which was based on the belief that computers were</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the work of Satan, that Bill Gates and Microsoft were tenacles of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the Satan, and that those who wished to fight evil must dedicate</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; themselves to promoting other operating systems, UNIX in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; particular.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Parker apparently fathered an organization called the "Circle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Eunuchs" that was dedicated to recruiting individuals who had</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the skills and the intelligence to develop systems and methodologies</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which could serve to work against what he saw as the plans of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Satan to bring domination over the whole earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    At various times, he has had vehicles registered in the states which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; were his main recruiting area: Texas, Arizona, California, New</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Mexico, and Oregon. (He also made limited recruiting trips to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Germany, Poland, and, I believe, Russia.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker spent time in California where he was in contact with Do,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; who shared his fetish for mixing computers and spirituality, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; was apparently Parker who introduced him to the concepts underlying</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the New Covenant Club.  Parker and Do also shared an affinity for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mixing spirituality and alien theories, and decided that the Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; was going to be the battleground of the future in the fight between</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; good and evil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker was also involved with a group in Berkeley, California,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Basis, Inc., which was heavily involved in a Unix time-sharing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; enterprise and gave Parker access to a wide variety of young</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; students and programmers to introduce to his belief system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker named the evil protagonist in the manuscript after the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; login name for one of Basis' founders, "Gomez."  Parker wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the book under the pseudonym of "son of gomez," as Basis'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Gomez was his mentor in the world of UNIX.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker was responsible for a manuscript titled "The Xenix</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Chainsaw Massacre" that contained a character, Bubba Rom Dos,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which was loosely based on Do, including veiled references to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; his sexual inclination toward youngsters.  Among those in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Circle of Eunuchs, it was also referred to as Part I of "The True</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Story of the Internet," which they foresaw as the vehicle that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would prove the manuscript prophetic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker and his tenacles used the Internet to quietly spread the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; manuscript among those thought to be potential recruits, even as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Do's group began making their impact on the Internet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker believed that Phil Zimmerman's troubles were a result</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of his group using Zimmerman's PGP to spread the manuscript</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; secretly across the Internet.  He apparently impressed upon Do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the need to use PGP to secure any communications which were</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of a nature that they could cause undue trouble for groups which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; were working against Satan and Gates.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker's second manuscript, Part II , began as "TV World" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; later was changed to "WebWorld and the Mythical Circle of Eunuchs."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    This manuscript was apparently supposed to be converted to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hypertext, with complete graphics, by Higher Source, and several</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; chapters were in the works, but about a week before the El Rancho</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; suicides, Parker was told that he should go ahead and release it in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; its present form, because Higher Source would not be in a position</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to complete the work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Parker began converting the second manuscript to hypertext himself</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and has had members of his organization releasing it on the Cypherpunks</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; list.  Chapters of the manuscript have been released from various points</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Russia.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Although the manuscript had already been completed around a year</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; before this, Parker, after receiving word to begin its release, began</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; making _changes_ in the manuscript, apparently as a result of no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; having a need to so heavily disguise the connection between the Circle</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of Eunuchs and Do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    A prologue was written for "WebWorld," sent to the Cypherpunks list</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on March 18, 1997, in which the opening strains contained the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; quote, "Why didn't I _do_ something?"  The word "do" was in bold</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hypertext.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Then, the next word in bold format was the word _me_, indicating</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that the first bold word should be pronounced as in the musical notes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; do, re, me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    The sentence containing the world _me_?  It was a reference to Do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; soon</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; being 'picked up,'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    "This time, they are coming for _me_."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    And the new opening sentence of the manuscript?  A veiled reference</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to the fact that those left behind had been warned of their last chance</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to 'escape' the fate that awaits them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "The great tragedy of it, is that it didn't have to happen.  Not at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; all...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; we were warned."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The URL's of the manuscripts are:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://bureau42.base.org/public/webworld/">http://bureau42.base.org/public/webworld/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://bureau42.base.org/public/xenix/xenbody.html">http://bureau42.base.org/public/xenix/xenbody.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    They are apparently hosted by David E. Smith &lt;dsmith@prairienet.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I don't believe that he is a member of Parker's inner circle, although</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; he</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; does have many connections to hackers and phreaks in the Edmonton,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Alberta area.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    Except for the prologue, the sections of the original manuscript seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to be in small print, with the newly written sections in large print.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; new sections appear to use the Cypherpunks as analogous to the space</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; aliens, and a new character, Jonathan, representing one of the Heaven's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Gate members, is added.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    "He rode the river of tears once again, only this time the journey</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; was</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; _toward_ the CypherPunks, and toward freedom."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    It is my understanding that the "Magic Circle" is quite active in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; both</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Western Canada and the Southwest U.S.  They seem to be a very secretive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; organization with ties to a number of groups, including the Solar Temple</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cult in Quebec, and a Diamond System (?) Freudian-Sufi sect centered in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the Bay area.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I dropped all involvement with these people a year or so ago, as I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; decided that involvement with them is unhealthy.  I hope that you will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; make an effort to check out what I have told you, and perhaps expose</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; any activities which could lead to more deaths and castrations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    I don't want to be involved with anything further to do with them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as I am uneasy about being connected with them in any way, shape,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; or form, although I still keep track of their activities through certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; members who are on the periphery of their organizations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;    C.J. Parker is a nome-de-plume he took on as a musician, and I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; recall his real name, but it shouldn't be too difficult to find, given</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fact that he has a criminal record in the U.S. which should link the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; pseudonym with his birth name.  He also might be located by tracking</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; him through his record releases, which were done in Canada, I believe.</i><br>
