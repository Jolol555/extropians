<i>&gt; I have said nothing even close to liking the book because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; `"resonating" with your own feelings'.  Please provide a direct quote.</i><br>
<p>
Upon rereading your post of the 5th, you're right.  That was an unfair<br>
characterization of your actual words, which just said things like<br>
"important", "probably right", "crucial" and such.  I extrapolated from<br>
my memory of this further than I should have, and I apologize.<br>
<p>
I suppose much of my reaction to that particular post may have been<br>
that you also described the book as "supported" (whatever that means)<br>
by both Clinton and Gingrich, as if that were something positive.  It<br>
took considerable effort on my part to not immediately dismiss it on<br>
those grounds alone, but I did manage to overcome my revulsion and<br>
spend some time reading the web site so I could dismiss it with a<br>
clearer conscience.<br>
