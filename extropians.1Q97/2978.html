On of the things that has NOT come up at all about cloning yoruself (<br>
everyone is being very pragmatic and clinical)  is how we will REACT to<br>
seeingour own DNA as a child, or all grown up and walking around. <br>
It is easy to talk of growing clones to extend our lifespan ( as if they were<br>
radishes) but parents have been known to throw themselves in front of trains<br>
to save their children, who carry *similar*  DNA.. do you suppose you might<br>
feel a bit of this kind of altruism and protective instinct, seeing your own<br>
DNA, born ( I assume a clone must have surrogate mothering- imagine if you<br>
were it's mother, or your mate had carried it to term) and raised?<br>
Would we take pride, watching it growing up and thriving? <br>
