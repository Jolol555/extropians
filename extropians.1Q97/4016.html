<i>&gt;There are lots of explicit models of situations like these, most but</i><br>

<i>&gt;people's opinions should be given a lot of weight, typically much more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than the weight given to your personal experience.  In fact, it turns</i><br>
<i>&gt;out to be difficult to explain persistent divergence in opinions. </i><br>
<p>
Clearly, then, this theory has two *major* defects.<br>
<p>
a)  The population as a whole is often wrong on major, simple issues (e.g.<br>
cloning)<br>
<p>
b) Persistent divergence is downright ubiquitous<br>
<p>
The obvious conclusion is that most if not all people do not use even a<br>
passable approximation of Bayesian inference.  I'd say most if not all people<br>
have their opinions driven by memetic replication (as exemplified by fashion<br>
and religion) and not a passable Bayesian approximation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I've read on Bayesian inference, judgements not based on Bayesian</i><br>
methods or methods with indistinguishable results are objectively bad.  If<br>
most people are using an objectively inferior inference process, what does<br>
that do to the value of other people's opinions for a rational Bayesian?<br>
<p>
Interestingly, science seems to conform to the predictions of this "community<br>
of Bayesian agents" model much better than society as a whole.  Persistent<br>
disagreement is common only when evidence is scanty and it's hard to think of<br>
examples where the scientific community sticks to objectively bad theories<br>
(as opposed to holding them in the past when evidence is inferior).  This<br>
would indicate that scientists, at least while working in their fields, are<br>
more "rational" than the population as a whole in the sense that they are<br>
closer to Bayesian agents.<br>
