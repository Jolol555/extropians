No reason we couldn't have an infinite amount of knowledge, but there would <br>
still be an infinite number of things we didn't know.<br>

There is nothing esoteric about my computer, I have programmed it to do <br>
nothing more sophisticated than arithmetic, the same sort they teach in grade <br>
school. If my computer were not hooked up to a H Bomb there would be nothing <br>
unusual about it at all. My computer takes an even number and then tries to <br>
find 2 prime numbers that add up to it. If it can find two such prime numbers<br>
it  adds 2 to the even number and tries again. If it can not find two such <br>
prime numbers the H Bomb goes off. Will the bomb go off? I don't think the <br>
bomb is interested in logical systems and I don't think any of them will <br>
protect me from the blast.<br>

                      <br>
<p>
You have said, and I certainly agree, that according to Godel a system can be <br>
complete or consistent but not both. Consistent just means you can't have  a <br>
proof that something is true and a proof that the same thing is not true, <br>
but if complete does not mean complete with respect to the truth what does it <br>
mean?                 <br>

<p>
<p>
Yes, and thinking is "simply" the way the brain manipulates symbols.<br>
