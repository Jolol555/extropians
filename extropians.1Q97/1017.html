<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Evolution is over.  I'm in charge now.  My genes have made the fatal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mistake of building a survival machine that is more powerful than them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and giving it free will.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; How has free will been proven to overcome evolution already? When did this</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen?  Isnt this a bit of a "controversial " statement?</i><br>
<p>
How can it be otherwise?  You are free to choose not to breed,<br>
aren't you?  That alone changes things.   My particular expression<br>
of the idea is perhaps a bit rhetorical, but the fact it represents<br>
is inevitable.  The processes that lead to our creation will<br>
continue, but the fundamental replicator unit is no longer a piece<br>
of DNA, because I've discovered it, and I can choose not to carry<br>
it into the next generation if I want.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would love to think that i can, by free will alone,  make myself live</i><br>
<i>&gt; indefinetely...</i><br>
<i>&gt; hmm...</i><br>
<p>
Certainly not.  Reality is still a constraint.  But you can use free<br>
will to overcome your natural urges to breed, or to encourage others<br>
to do the same.  Therefore, the mental processes that lead to our<br>
choices to propogate (I use that term instead of "breed" because the<br>
latter implies biological propogation only) are the replicators from<br>
now on, not our DNA.<br>
<p>
The process of natural evolution is simply a mathematical consequence<br>
of duplication, mutation, and competition.  It is inevitable, and will<br>
continue.  What changes, though, are the entities upon which it works.<br>
For this period of Earth's history, it has been little chunks of DNA.<br>
<i>&gt;From now on, since we have free will, it will be little chunks of</i><br>
motivation.  Of course, DNA will continue in other non-free species,<br>
and other replicators may be discovered as well.  But for /us/, we<br>
no longer slavishly serve DNA.<br>
