Eugene, I found your dialogue informative, but we have a major<br>
discrepancy in our judgement of what is real. Alife is as real to me as<br>
is someone being killed in a television show. It is *artificial*. Thats<br>
why they call it *artificial* life. It is not real. If I am to be<br>
uploaded into a computer I don't want *artificial* emotions. I want<br>
emotions that I can really feel and experience. I would not accept a<br>
conceptual abstraction of emotions that merely effected and did not<br>
affect me. <br>
<p>
In your dialogue you refer to "Alife" rather than "Artificial life". I<br>
know this is common practice, but there might be another level of denial<br>
involved. <br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
