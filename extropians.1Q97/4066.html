I responded to Curt Adams:<br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, we have moved away from your claim that you can easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; generate examples to demonstrate the ubiquity of "opinion divergence</i><br>
<i>&gt; on matters of fact, where each side knows of the other's opinion".</i><br>
<p>
To which Michael Lorrey responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Try these: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;JFK assasination</i><br>
<i>&gt;Roswell Incident</i><br>
<i>&gt;MLK assasination</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why we "lost" Vietnam</i><br>
<i>&gt;The abortion controversy</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Holocaust</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Rosenberg Trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Alger Hiss trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;Contragate (esp. Ollie North)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;COmmunism</i><br>
<i>&gt;Socialism</i><br>
<i>&gt;Evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Big Bang</i><br>
<i>&gt;SDI</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Second Amendment</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;any questions?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  We need more detail about these to evaluate their relevance.<br>
Specifically, we need to see that:<br>
1. There are (at least) two communities, each aware of the other's views.<br>
2. These views are relatively stable and substantial different.<br>
3. These views reflect actual beliefs, not just verbal posturing.<br>
4. The dispute has lasted long enough so both sides know that <br>
   both sides know that both sides know (etc.) ... that they disagree.<br>
5. Both sides see the issue as a dispute over fact, not values, and <br>
   believe that the other side does as well.<br>
6. We can't easily dismiss one group as small and primarily composed of <br>
   people who are much more "cognitively broken" than most.<br>
7. We can't easily dismiss the type of issue as exceptional in <br>
   inducing "broken cognition" even in ordinary people.  <br>
This is the sort of example needed to suggest that ordinary people in<br>
ordinary contexts often have persistent disagreements contrary to<br>
Bayesian expectations. <br>
