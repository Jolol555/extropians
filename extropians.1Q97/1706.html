I don't much want to start a religious Mac/PC flamewar, but if anyone<br>
would like to know about my adventures in Ethernet networking my Macs<br>
(SE, PowerMac 6100) and my P(iece of) C(rap), Micron Pentium box I'd<br>
be happy to rant.  After 20 hours work by my company's best PC support<br>
person, the PC still isn't working.  Partial rant #1: I have to run 95<br>
sometimes because of some math software, which doesn't run on NT4<br>
(gee, what a shock).  I'd sure like to be able to print to my<br>
networked printer (HP Copyjet w/ Jetdirect card) from 95.  I am told<br>
by all the experts that I've spoken to that you cannot print to a<br>
network printer from 95 without using *another* PC running NT as your<br>
print server.  No wonder they sell so bloody many PC: you need to buy<br>
another PC to fucking print to the network, something a Mac Plus can<br>
do just by fucking plugging it in.<br>
<p>
Yeah, pretty damn brilliant.<br>
