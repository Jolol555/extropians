<i>&gt;HIV-2 is almost genetically identical to HIV-1 (see MCM p. 1013) and causes</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS-like disease in African monkeys.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;The HIV skeptics don't like the data showing HIV is so identical to animal</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS because Koch's postulates are proven easier than with human HIV.  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt;though Koch's postulates have been satisfied by retrospective investigations</i><br>
<i>&gt;of accidental infections with HIV such as the dental cases and hemophilia</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases (to say nothing of the millions of homosexual male infections).   About</i><br>
<i>&gt;200 skeptics are still not satisfied vs.about 35,000 ASM members who are so</i><br>
<i>&gt;far convinced that Koch's postulated are satisfied. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;It would be interesting to determine if these seemingly minor genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;differences change latency period prior to AIDS -like symptoms.  </i><br>

One of Koch's postulates is that you should be able to cause the same<br>
disease by injecting the supposed agent into a new victim.  Obviously, this<br>
has been tough to prove with HIV because nobody wants to volunteer as a test<br>
case.  However, recently chimpanzees injected the human HIV virus have been<br>
coming down with AIDs like symptoms, declining T-cells, and at least one<br>
appears to have died of the disease.  The latency period is every bit as<br>
long in chimps as it is in people, making these difficult and expensive<br>
experiments to carry out.  But they now appear to satisfy the most important<br>
of Koch's postulates.<br>
