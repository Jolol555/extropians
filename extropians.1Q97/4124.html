For the record, it appeared that I was being quoted as saying all the above,<br>
but in fact, those were someone else's responses to things which I had said.<br>
 Here are my responses to U.Sov.'s final comments:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Furthermore, I think that the resources of the original should</i><br>
<i>&gt;be divided equally with the clone, as the clone was just as responsible</i><br>
<i>&gt;for achiveing the wealth as the original.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cloning is giving birth to a life form.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Must I give up half of what I own to a child not yet born?</i><br>
<p>
I would say that, in the case of complete and perfect replication (intact<br>
with memories), not just regular cloning, then the copy is in fact just as<br>
much the original as was the original at the time of the copy.  Thus, it<br>
would be inaccurate to say it is "a child not yet born".  If you walk into a<br>
duplication chamber of some type, and knowingly copy yourself, the "you" that<br>
comes out of the side marked "the copy", will be no less the person who<br>
originally walked into the duplication chamber than the person who comes out<br>
of the side marked "the original".  It's not like a photo copying machine,<br>
where there is a 15% degradation in quality.  It is 100% the original.  I<br>
think the question of "who's who" loses meaning in the debate.  The fact is<br>
you slit into two pieces (seemingly).<br>
<p>
I would like to furthur one of my original comments which few people have<br>
picked up upon.  The question of "punishment".  The only form of punishment I<br>
think to be valid is to have the "criminal" make restitution to the best of<br>
his/her/its ability, then to work on changing the original "flaw" which<br>
caused the crime.  Remember, I speak only of real crimes, not socially<br>
imagined ones (rampant in the imaginations of many).  To simply "punish"<br>
someone causes no net benefit to anyone, but is rather a form of revenge.  I<br>
see no purpose in prisons at all.  Either do as I suggest, or impliment a<br>
death penalty.  I opt for the prior.  If someone is truely "beyond help", if<br>
there is such a thing, then either hold them in a special labor camp until we<br>
can neurally restructure them, or put them into cryo-stasis until that time.<br>
 This would be the most logical and "humane" thing to do.  If anyone has<br>
anything to add, please do so.<br>
<p>
In response to another statement:<br>
<i>&gt;As for neural modifications, I would doubt that</i><br>
<i>&gt;they would be effective, without destroying the victims personality.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That's the point, to give them a new personality through brain-washing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is being done.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think neural restructuring would destroy the original person.  I'm<br>
only speaking of eliminating the particular characteristic which is harmful<br>
(pleasure in killing, raping, stealing, etc.).  It would be the best thing<br>
anyone could do for the person.  It involves less force than would killing<br>
the person.  Force is not to be used EXCEPT in self defense or preventing an<br>
"insane" person from doing furthur harm.  'Til next time, Shawn Johnson.<br>
