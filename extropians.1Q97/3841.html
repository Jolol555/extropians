Perhaps it's spring fever, but we get two negative posts today, one right<br>
after the other, Eugene Leitl's and Velociman's.  I know I've had the same<br>
thoughts as Eugene: "Keeping up with the lists takes a hell of a lot of time;<br>
what does it contribute to getting things DONE that I want to get done?"  And<br>
I've had the same experiences as Velociman: Most of the people to whom I<br>
explain transhumanism and extropianism have negative reactions.<br>
<p>
But there are antidotes to these negative thoughts.  First, I've learned to<br>
read less of the list.  Once a thread wanders into an area in which I'm not<br>
interested (or if it starts that way), I just delete the messages.  Some<br>
times I have pangs of guilt, especially if I delete a message by an author<br>
whose writing I've liked in the past, but keeping up with things takes some<br>
ruthlessness these days.<br>
<p>
More importantly, Eugene and Velociman both point to the same problem, but in<br>
different ways.  Eugene despairs of actually bringing our goals to fruition<br>
and Velociman fears we will be stopped by those who oppose us.  Work toward<br>
one can help avoid the other, but it needs to be done right.  The fact is, as<br>
others have pointed out, post-humanity won't HAPPEN on an e-mail list.  <br>
<p>
Post-humanity will happen in a thousand laboratories and businesses.  This is<br>
where the real forefront of transhumanism and extropianism lies.  Our<br>
important work is there.  If you're a researcher or entrepreneur, go to it.<br>
 As the ad campaign says, "Just do it."  If, like me, you're more of a<br>
"culture worker", there is also important work to do.  I see that important<br>
work on two fronts.  <br>
<p>
First, transhumanism and extropianism has to be expressed in public.  Yes, it<br>
will draw criticism and opposition.  But not expressing our ideas leaves the<br>
field to luddites.  Finding ways to express our ideas in ways that appeal to<br>
existing cultural values is very important.  Avoiding statements that attract<br>
the critiques described in Velociman's post is key.  I've never convinced a<br>
committed luddite or "deathist", but I HAVE planted seeds in open minds and<br>
HAVE seen them bear fruit.  Pushing someone from "Biotech 101" to the<br>
Singularity in one conversation is a bad idea.  Gently pointing out the<br>
contradictions between support for advanced medical research and opposition<br>
to augmentation of healthy humans works well.  Pushing someone from support<br>
for individual autonomy to privately produced law in one conversation is a<br>
bad idea.  Gently pointing out historical examples of failed interventions in<br>
market economics (such as the "oil crises" caused by price controls) works<br>
well.<br>
<p>
Perhaps even more hopeful, I find that there is a real generation gap in<br>
response to exposure to transhumanism and extropiansim.  Simply put, younger<br>
people react better.  Even folks in their late 20s seem to be more willing to<br>
cross the intellectual threshold to transhumanist and extropian ideas than<br>
people in their mid-30s.<br>
<p>
On a broader front, our ideas need articulate spokepeople, skilled in<br>
mass-market writing and public speaking.  We have a few.  We need more.<br>
 Unfortunately, the personality best suited for the laboratory is often not<br>
well suited to the talk show.  The writing style best suited for the<br>
scientific journal is definitely not well suited to the popular magazine or<br>
best-selling book.  Both are critical to the success of our ideas.<br>
<p>
Beyond this, and of crucial practical importance, we must reach a key<br>
audience of actors and opinion leaders in the scientific and business fields<br>
from which transhumanist technologies will be born.  An extropian and<br>
transhumanist "movement" limited to a small cadre of students and enthusiasts<br>
communicating on the net is no real "movement" at all.  As valuable as this<br>
list is, it will never be the right tool for contacting, motivating and<br>
coordinating the efforts of key players in developing the "transhumanist tool<br>
kit."  Some good ideas for this key task have been discussed.  Implementing<br>
them in the relatively short term is very important if we are to have a<br>
chance to withstand the opposition to our goals which is sure to grow over<br>
the next few years.<br>
<p>
I note one serious problem with crossing a threshold to "respectability" of<br>
our ideas for those whose efforts we need to implement the transhumanist<br>
agenda.  While science thrives on SCIENTIFIC controversy, it withers in the<br>
face of social and political controversy.  While business enterprise thrives<br>
on ECONOMIC competition, it avoids ideological competition.  Most working<br>
scientists and technologists are rightly afraid of becoming publicly involved<br>
in social controversy, for fear of losing funding for their research.<br>
 Businessmen fear explicit or implicit boycott.  Overcoming this problem is<br>
one of the key challenges facing us.<br>
<p>
Dynamically optimistic,<br>
