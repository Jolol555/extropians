<p>
Uh, I thought this would be because when the injured skier sues in<br>
government court, the court ignores the ticket contract.  Same as you<br>
can always sue for malpractice.  Same as various commercial waivers that<br>
say "Void where prohibited by state law."  Contracts between individuals<br>
don't mean squat to the extent that the government you feel is necessary<br>
chooses to void the contracts.<br>
<p>
That the point you were trying to make?<br>
