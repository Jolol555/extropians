Although they deny it. the evidence is fairly good that China has some pretty <br>
big slave labor camps and that the labor they supply is not a trivial factor <br>
in their export economy. They're not exactly slaves in that they're not bought <br>
and sold, but they are political prisoners forced to work in deplorable <br>
conditions. I have not heard about things like that going on at that scale in <br>
South Korea or El Salvador, but I'm nit picking. I'm sure nobody on this list <br>
approves of slavery, even if it is done to people far away that we don't know, <br>
the question is, how far are you willing to go to  stop it? Would you pay <br>
100$ to stop it? Would you be willing to take a 10% drop in your standard of<br>
living to stop it? How about 40%? How about 90% ?  Would you be willing to <br>
die to stop it?<br>
<p>
These are not easy questions, everybody must answer them for themselves. <br>
It will be hard enough to convince myself that I made the correct decisions, <br>
I certainly am not qualified to answer them for you, and that is the essence <br>
of Libertarian capitalism. <br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;In the case of a socialistic win-win situation, you have                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;cases where two people agree to work on building a house.</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
You used the word "agree" so it can't be socialistic. Socialism is when I  <br>
say "Build a house for me or give me money to do so, if you don't then men <br>
carrying automatic weapons will knock down your door and drag you away". <br>
As for libertarian socialism, it's a contradiction in terms.<br>

<i>                &gt;their agreement is not based on the exchange of capital, but                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the fact that they both need each others labor.  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
That's just barter, you fix my car and I'll fix your roof, pure capitalism. <br>
True, it's a little more common today to see, "if you fix my car I'll give <br>
you this picture of a dead president printed on processed wood pulp", but the <br>
principle is exactly the same.  <br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;One could try to sucker the other individual into doing most                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;of the work, and then you would have a win-lose situation.   </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
As you described by you it sound like breach of contract, the other party <br>
would probably describe it differently, better decide on an arbiter to sort  <br>
it out.             <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;A capitalism without the state would not do away with state                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;regulations of private property, because the new private                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;state put up to protect private property would prevent people                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;from utilizing vast areas of property.  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
But you're assuming that only a state can make laws, even today that's not <br>
entirely true. You and I can sign a contract independent of the state and <br>
that's a sort of law, a law that only you and I must obey. We can even state  <br>
in the contract that if there is a disagreement over interpretation we will <br>
not bring the matter to the public courts but to a private arbitrator. <br>
Big corporations often do that sort of thing right now, nobody want to get <br>
caught up in the court system, it's so slow and expensive that even if you <br>
win you lose, but what else can you expect, government runs the courts, <br>
arbitrators make a profit.<br>
<p>
Everybody benefits from a good law, it's a public good, that's why good laws <br>
are so rare when government makes them. Just like everything else, if you want <br>
high quality then make law a commodity and sell it in the open market.<br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;meme. </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Well that's certainly not true, many great capitalists have also been great <br>
philanthropists, in fact most have. The only thing Anarcho- Capitalism is at <br>
war against is me deciding what is altruistic and what is not and then making <br>
you spend your money on my brainstorm. You may have very different ideas <br>
about the best way to be altruistic.<br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;libertarian socialism, is based on working class                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;individualists putting their own self-interests first and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;_abandoning_ the system of private property that exploits                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;them. </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I strongly disagree that capitalism exploits people, and if you take the word <br>
"libertarian" seriously you will let me keep my opinion, unless you think the <br>
word means  only the right to hold the exact same views you do. If you and <br>
your friends want to start a socialist society I have not the slightest <br>
objection, just don't make me join, I want to stay with capitalism. Let's <br>
fight it out in the marketplace of ideas, may the best meme win.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;there is ALWAYS a win-lose side to capitalism in how workers                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;are treated.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why? If I'm rude to my workers I'll have to pay them more to compensate,   <br>
otherwise they'll quit and join the competition.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Libertarian Socialism/ anarcho-syndicalism encourages people                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to work and be paid a fair wage (WIN-WIN) when they are                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;employed.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why? If I work hard or sleep on the job it doesn't matter, I get paid the <br>
same. No point in me looking for a brilliant technological method to increase <br>
production, this is Socialism and we all get paid the same regardless, let <br>
somebody else work on it, I want to take a nap.<br>
