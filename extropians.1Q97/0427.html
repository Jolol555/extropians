<i>                &gt;But NO is not the only neurotransmitter/neuromodulator,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;there are several (some say several 100) kinds of neuron</i><br>

<i>                &gt;neurotransmitters.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
All true, but it doesn't  change the fact that LTP refuses to stay put in<br>
a single synapse but spreads out, so if LPT is part of long term memory then<br>
the maximum storage capacity of the brain just went south.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;NO's diffusion range is also certainly limited. Does it</i><br>
<i>                &gt;really affect hundreds of synapses?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't think anybody knows how many synapses it changes, I said 1000 but that<br>
was just a guess. I do know that the concentration of synapses is very high<br>
in the brain, so the radius of a sphere that contained 1000 synapses would be<br>
pretty small, the NO would not have to defuse very far before it started to<br>
reset a lot of synapses.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Sejnowski is certainly very well known. But this doesn't</i><br>
<i>                &gt;mean NO diffusion-induced potentiation is the silver bullet,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;to explain away every single mystery.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nobody said it did, but it does drastically revise downward the amount of<br>
information the most popular information storage mechanism in the brain can<br>
handle.                               <br>
<p>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;Sejnowski:</i><br>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;"The individual synapse cannot be the computer bit of the</i><br>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;brain. Instead of thinking of a synapse as representing a</i><br>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;piece of information, you can now begin thinking of a</i><br>
<i>                  &gt;&gt;population of potentiated synapses acting together".</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Eugene:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;That would be very good news, if true.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes indeed, not only does it mean that there is less information to upload but<br>
the massive redundancy means there is a better chance of extracting the needed<br>
information from even a badly damaged frozen brain.<br>
<p>

<i>                        &gt;&gt; the simplest solution is astronomically small.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Eugene:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;Yes, but generating _many_ subsystems when a single one would</i><br>
<i>                &gt;have been sufficient... The evolutionary distance should be,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;at least intuitionally, larger.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Evolution can't backtrack, it has no foresight so every mutation must benefit<br>
an animal NOW or it won't survive. Once biology sets a standard it would be<br>
hell to change it, think of the trouble we have in changing to a new computer<br>
operating system, even if the new one is a lot better, then multiply that<br>
difficulty by about a billion.<br>
<p>
                                                                  <br>
<i>                &gt;Hauling heavy noble gas atoms on a cold Ni surface/reversibly</i><br>
<i>                &gt;poking holes in molybdenum disulfide surface is one thing,</i><br>
<i>                &gt;writing diamondoid billion-atom-carbon-structures from active</i><br>
<i>                &gt;species is another matter entirely.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Agreed, massive engineering questions remain, but that's what they are,<br>
engineering. Carbon atoms, Nobel gas atoms, a kids paper airplane and a<br>
thousand ton cargo jet, all obey the same laws of physics.<br>
                                                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;That a wrong comparison. Mechanosynthesis didn't have its</i><br>
<i>                &gt;Wright bros. yet.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In 1687 when Isaac Newton wrote the most important book in the history of the<br>
world, he would have had to say that a rocket to the moon did not violate any<br>
known physical law.                                          <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;John:</i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;we already know a STM can break a chemical bond.  In the</i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;June 16 1995 issue of Science it's shown that if electrons</i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;of the correct energy are shot at an atom from the tip of a</i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;STM the atom will resonate and the resulting vibration will</i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;break the chemical bond.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Eugene:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;Yes, but can it generate/break is specifically</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know but it seems like a pretty good bet to me, different atoms<br>
resonate at different frequencies.                 <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;doubtlessly STM can do atomic manipulation. Question is: is</i><br>
<i>                &gt;the capability sufficient for autoreplication/all purpose</i><br>
<i>                &gt;mechanosynthesis?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I could be wrong but I very much doubt that a STM could do that, but it might<br>
be able to make something that could, or make something that makes something<br>
that could. At ant rate, it certainly proves that it's possible to manipulate<br>
individual atoms, the rest is just engineering, although I admit an awful lot<br>
of engineering.                                  <br>
