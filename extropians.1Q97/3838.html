I felt like ranting today, for no good reason. (Actually there _is_<br>
a very good reason: the first item on my todo list is to reduce the<br>
number of items on my todo list). So diving off (I never surf, you<br>
see) into the net never has failed to defocus one attention from<br>
something quite mundane, and also, urgent.<br>
<p>
It would be interesting to find out, whether nonlurk-mode on a<br>
high-volume mailing list, or (gosh!) several of them is compatible<br>
with leading a "normal", productive life. I strongly suspect that a<br>
productive life and net presence might be strongly mutex. For once,<br>
it's the sheer time spent in logging in, out, keeping track of one's<br>
files, back-ups (or lack thereof), cranky networks, overflowing<br>
mailboxes, irate admins, RNAs, and godknowsnotwhatelses. For other,<br>
it's drained attention. If you still continue a virtual dispute,<br>
when in the bathroom, or on your way to work, and even do not<br>
own a wearable, things obviously seem to have started running<br>
amiss. Even in its fly-encased-in-amber latency, and (especially<br>
hereabouts) nonexistent bandwidth, the transient inability of,<br>
when offline, plucking (irr)relevant infamation out of thin air<br>
is absolutely maddenning. Let's face it, we're all junkies.<br>
Well-informed junkies. Revoltingly well-informed junkies.<br>
<p>
All geared up with nowhere to go. Go get a life.<br>
<p>
A secondary effect of this is neglection of tracking the treekiller<br>
press, where all the action still is. Another one is an adoption of<br>
breathless-from-message-to-message-hopping, and clickety-clickety-<br>
click thinking style one so easily gets trapped in. Let's admit it,<br>
our tools have become progressively blunted, our concepts crude.<br>
Distinguishing fantasy from reality gets harder day by day.<br>
<p>
At least for me.<br>
<p>
That todo list thing was not a joke. The danger of letting Things<br>
Which Matter just lie is very real -- thus I have great respect<br>
and understanding for those, who transiently, or, permanently, have<br>
pulled the unsubscription emergency plug. We will miss their<br>
input, but I suppose their contribution in the Real World will<br>
more than outweigh that. Which brings us, the list people<br>
(sure biased, since intrinsically preselected) who make their<br>
virtual appearances, and exits, to _our_ roles. Is it exhilarating,<br>
to know that our contribution (being observers merely, cheerleaders<br>
at best) won't matter on the really long run, or, simply,<br>
depressing?<br>
<p>
For me, it is the latter. With a newbie's touching naivete I once<br>
supposed the extropian/transhumanist movements, simply because of<br>
their so obvious _rightness_, the constructivity of their goals,<br>
to become a crystallization nucleus, the memefective agent, the<br>
catalysator of a rapid phase transition in a metastable,<br>
supercritical system.<br>
<p>
Well, I gauged wrong. The system is not nigh supercritical.<br>
<p>
"Gar nicht erst ignorieren" as Gundolf Freyermuth had it so<br>
aptly put. It does not matter being able to skry the shape of<br>
possible alternative futures, with the mind's eye, to pierce the<br>
opaque walls of a hypothetical fitness function, to burst forth<br>
into the light of a better local fitness optimum, if you're unable<br>
to implement these visions, strap your audience into chairs, and<br>
whack them onto their heads with them for hours, until they see.<br>
They won't.<br>
<p>
Because, though the maximum of the bell-shaped distribution is<br>
distinctly better than the lowest common denominator<br>
libertarianism and totally free markets won't bring us<br>
into that utopian Eden we so like to talk about. Free markets<br>
will fail to hit the optimum for the same reason communism never<br>
worked. Never could. The ideally enlightened consumer is a myth.<br>
Real ones fall prey to marketing propaganda, peer pressure,<br>
failure to enact long-term optimization but optimizing locally<br>
instead. Kinetical, myopic-Hamiltonian, instead of thermodynamical<br>
control. Abandoning all pretense to rational choice once beyond a<br>
certain complexity threshold.<br>
<p>
Missing the minimum, and not even aware of it. Not even caring.<br>
<p>
(The things Stu Kauffman said in his "At Home in the Universe"<br>
book, in the "An Emerging Global Civilization" chapter are sure<br>
heartening, but he might be wrong. Let's hope he isn't).<br>
<p>
Anyway, which impact should this reasoning have on our real-world<br>
heuristics, our plans, our strategies? ("Ours" here specifically<br>
meaning those striving to achieve a self-consistent transhumanist<br>
stance). Whence to acquire that fine olfactorics to early-detect<br>
a shit brewing in the works? The muscle to unroot and the robustness<br>
to flourish in new environments? I guess one can train this.<br>
Better, it should.<br>
<p>
Anybody feeling like relating his/hers experiences?<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
