You don't need anyone's permission to do this.  If you are right, then<br>
there is a profit to be made by starting such an Institute.  Students<br>
would be willing to pay a substantial amount to avoid the expense of<br>
the extra unneeded schooling time.  <br>
<p>
I suspect, however, that you have vastly overestimate the wasted time<br>
and the the ease of doing such testing.  <br>
