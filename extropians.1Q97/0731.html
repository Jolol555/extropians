I've been thinking about the issue, and I've finally nailed down why it<br>
is that "Extropic Art" seems out of place by "Nanotechnology", while<br>
"Cryonics" doesn't.  After all, cryonics is almost exactly similar to<br>
Extropic Art in that no matter how important it is, it won't accelerate<br>
the Singularity.  Freezing people doesn't contribute to scientific<br>
progress, except by exciting comment, popularizing, increasing the<br>
benefits of being Extropian, helping our personalities by lessening our<br>
fear of death, and so on.  Which is not to say that cryonics (or<br>
Extropic Art) aren't good things; they just aren't direct-to-Singularity<br>
research projects.  That's what I said earlier.  Why, then, is cryonics,<br>
but not Art, on the list?<br>
<p>
I know what's missing.  Hubris.  In nanotechnology and cryonics and<br>
intelligence enhancement, and especially the Singularity, there is a<br>
sense of power and might and challenging the foundations of the<br>
Universe... challenging the gods, not just in the Greek tradition, but<br>
that of the Tower of Babel.  Cryonics is a battle against one of the<br>
most fundamental laws of everyday life:  Death is supposed to be<br>
permanent.  Nanotechnology would overthrow "by the sweat of your brow<br>
you shall eat bread" (and, for that matter, pain in childbirth, the<br>
other half of the punishment).  And that was all for eating from the<br>
Tree of Good and Evil; now, it seems that we are about to eat from the<br>
Tree of Life, and, with the Singularity, "be as us" (i.e. God), against<br>
which the first mated pair of humans was kicked out of the Garden.<br>
<p>
Extropic Art may be a *celebration* of hubris, as this letter is, but it<br>
is not itself hubristic.  This letter does not represent a challenge to<br>
the gods, certainly not in the way that trying to create a soul does. <br>
It's about something human.  A great and powerful something human,<br>
something deeply and inherently moving, an important part of the human<br>
spirit... which is another way of saying that Extropic Art is an<br>
affirmation of what is best about us *right* *now*.  The subject<br>
material may be what will come, but it can't actually *be* what will<br>
come... only what some humans *think* will come.  There's something<br>
tragic and terrible about it, as I kept on trying to say in "Staring<br>
Into The Singularity" (which, now that I think about it, is more<br>
Extropic Art than cognitive science).<br>
<p>
It reminds me of a thought I once had while thinking over the idea of<br>
telekinesis, some years back... that emotional energy, *wanting* to move<br>
an object, *visualizing* the object moving, was likely to do absolutely<br>
nothing.  I liked to use the metaphor of lifting your hand; you don't<br>
lift your hand by shouting, "Lift, hand, lift!"  No amount of emotional<br>
energy will suffice to lift your arm.  You need to send out motor<br>
impulses by an effort of will along a specific and nonverbalizable<br>
mental dimension.<br>
<p>
Moral of the story:  Celebrating hubris is one dimension; carrying it<br>
out is a lot of non-hubristic hard thinking.  And though it may seem<br>
that I'm raising one above the other, well, if necessary I'd rather<br>
preserve Drexler before Vinge.  But I don't think they should be<br>
regarded as rivals any more than, say, farming and computer science, or<br>
marketing and engineering.<br>
<p>
Final note:  Some of you may notice inconsistencies between the tone of<br>
this letter and previous soliloquies on Extropian Art.  That's because<br>
my thoughts on the subject reached that critical mass I was talking<br>
about earlier... *now*, I think I understand. <br>
<p>
That having been said, I'm going to add Extropic Art to the poll anyway,<br>
because the whole goals-vs.-means prioritization has clearly bombed. <br>
Instead I think we should go with a simple list of concepts and 1-to-10<br>
ratings.<br>
