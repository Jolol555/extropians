All this stuff about one little religion.  I've followed this religious<br>
stuff for man years<br>
now,  and it doesn't  sound much diffrent than any other christian dogma<br>
of all the<br>
christians of the world. Almost all christains and many other religions<br>
feel they<br>
have to die to enter heavens gate.  Many  think it will be done in a<br>
rapture where<br>
all rightous people will leave their humanly  carcasas on earth and  be<br>
taken up  to another<br>
place at god's (some alien who they don't know) bidding.  Sounds the same<br>
to me.  Most<br>
christains today fully and openly plan to die,  and even look forward to<br>
it.  This is<br>
 why it's so hard to get them interested in transhumanism.  They want to<br>
go an<br>
 be an angel or trekee in socalled  gods kingdom, or on his spaceship, <br>
where<br>
 who knows what they will do.<br>
<p>
I think the entire USA is making a bunch of hoopla about something they<br>
say is weard<br>
inyet they are all a bunch of weard hypocrytes,  because they believe the<br>
same thing.  The<br>
only diffrence,  is that most christians and others don't have enough<br>
guts to get it<br>
over with on their own timeline.<br>
<p>
I would say that almost all religious fanatics of this sort  that are<br>
death orented are kooks.<br>
It's time people start seeing through this BS.<br>
