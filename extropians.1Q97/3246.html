<i>&gt; Now I'm confused.  Are you saying that you can go about your life,</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as walking through new buildings or driving on new streets</i><br>
<i>&gt; without making any predictions based on all those subconscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; measurements you make?  All it gives you are "conjectures to test"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; You don't predict "Hmm.. I think going up those stairs would probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; get me to the second floor"?  Or are you saying you do predict but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it is "dangerous"?  (relative to what?)</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I do mean something like that.  Much of our day-to-day<br>
activity can be accomplished purely by subconscious pattern-matching.<br>
Even something as complex as driving, once learned, becomes a self-<br>
reinforcing pattern stored and brought up when needed, but not<br>
actively reasoned.  "Driving on automatic" is something we've all<br>
experienced: you may remember getting in the car, and getting out<br>
at work, but all that stuff in between quickly fades from short-<br>
term conscious memory because it didn't need your attention once<br>
you've done it a few times.<br>
<p>
Even reactive behaviors can be put on automatic this way: ask any<br>
good video game player.  He doesn't conscously think about every<br>
little goblin; he has trained his mental facilities to instantly<br>
recognize situations, and instantly respond with actions.  Even new<br>
situations get matched to something similar.  The number of patterns<br>
of a Rubik's cube is so many that the odds of a sufficiently random<br>
arrangement being one I've encountered before are basically zero.<br>
But if you put that random cube in my hand, I would solve it in a<br>
minute or two, because I trained myself to do it.  I might even have<br>
a hard time explaining how nowadays, because I've forgotten all the<br>
mathematical basis, but my hands remember all the moves, and my<br>
subconscious mind remembers the patterns.<br>
<p>
What more controlled, quantitative analyses are needed for is the<br>
formulation of rules that are likely to hold for completely new<br>
situations, and that can be communicated meaningfully to people<br>
who have not shared your specific experiences.  Social predictions<br>
fall into this category, as do scientific hypotheses.  The machinery<br>
that lets me solve a Rubik's cube also makes the minds of social<br>
commentators fall upon interesting parallels and patterns that they<br>
can often find some way to express; by then making analogies to the<br>
previous instances of those patterns, they extrapolate how to deal<br>
with these new things.  This is probably a useful function of the<br>
brain for dealing with life, but it is a primitive, incomplete, and<br>
purely heuristic way of doing it.  More trustable decisions demand<br>
more rigorous methods.  Especially when the minds of other free<br>
individuals enter the picture.  Seat-of-the-pants heuristics aren't<br>
enough to find the common laws of nature shared by two minds with<br>
different processes.  You need measurements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And when I said that Strauss &amp; Howe don't give quantitiative data, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; meant that they refer to relevant historical facts as evidence, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they don't map them onto numbers nor organize them in a way that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would make a statistical analysis convenient.  This sounds like data</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as much as your visual perceptions of a building.  </i><br>
<p>
I will concede that historical facts--if they are accurate--are "data"<br>
of the one-bit kind.  But one must refrain from using them as "evidence"<br>
of something other than their mere existence, unless you are rigorous<br>
about your methods of selecting sample sets and measuring statistical<br>
significance of outcomes.  Otherwise, one can just pick the pattern and<br>
then find historical facts to fit it.  Proper science doesn't work that<br>
way: your mind suggests patterns, but then you must do the measurements<br>
cleanly if you want to prove that the pattern means something.<br>
<p>
I am guilty of using such extrapolations sometimes.  I have said, for<br>
example, "In every century of human history since the creation of<br>
governments, governments have killed more people than the criminals<br>
they were created to protect us from."  I say this to imply that<br>
governments, as a rule, aren't a good idea.  But if I'm challenged to<br>
say what it really means, I'd have to admit that it's just data, and<br>
it doesn't by itself predict anything, even though it's accurate.  It<br>
is very suggestive--and it leads me to investigate /why/ this might be<br>
the case, and to discover the nature of power and conflict, but if I<br>
want to actually predict what a certain kind of government might do,<br>
I'd better have more than this simple pattern to back me up. <br>
