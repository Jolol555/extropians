I accidently sent this before I was done with it....Sorry, this doesn't<br>
happen very often....<br>
<p>
I said:<br>
"One could say that women are more genetically inclined towards learning<br>
languages?  There are a lot of multi-lingualed women in language programs,<br>
and many top level, (for instance the UN) translators, are women.  Or<br>
perhaps people with a musical ear are more inclined to hearing the tonality<br>
differences and can learn other language pronunciations"....  perhaps being<br>
able to quickly learn software is in the genes.... (which of course is<br>
ridiculous) see how strange this gets?     I doubt there is a genome out<br>
there specifically geared towards "mathematics" or that an aptitude is<br>
specifically charted in your genes.  I think it would be more appropriate<br>
to look at the cultural background and opportunities to learn a particular<br>
discipline.  Of course if you have a genetic abnormality and your cerebral<br>
cortex doesn't completely develop, then you may not be able to learn<br>
certain things.  <br>
<p>
Physical talents, like the voice, manual dexterity, etc, I could see being<br>
on the genetic strands.  General intelligence, like "IQ" etc, I can see as<br>
being on the genetic strands as well, but those are only good as long as<br>
you exercise them.<br>
<p>
One thing I haven't seen mentioned is a phenomena I've witnessed, and read<br>
about:  Women seem more suited to intuitive and "circular" reasoning, men<br>
seem more prone to linear directed thought ie, a -&gt;b-&gt;c.  Now math seems to<br>
me much more linear.....so perhaps this is a partial explanation as to why<br>
there are not as many women in fields that kinda "limit" themselves to this<br>
kind of thought.  I was surprised when I helped to organize the fuzzy logic<br>
conference as to how many women I saw attend, but I guess it makes a bit<br>
more sense in that in this field there are shades of gray....rather than<br>
absolutes.  <br>
<p>
I think it interesting however that this thread has included "science" as<br>
one of the fields that women don't gravitate towards.  I don't think that<br>
is valid.  I know plenty of women in scientific fields, from anthropology<br>
to biology, to physics.  And perhaps that is because I live in a more<br>
culturally liberated area...Santa Cruz and the Bay Area are much more open<br>
to that then other parts of the country.  So I guess that proves this<br>
particular idea (that aptitudes in certain learning areas are predetermined<br>
by genetics) is wrong.  <br>
<p>
Genius, itself, has nothing to do with sex.  <br>
<p>
Now I have a question that I suspect I know the answer to, but it's an<br>
observation and I would like to throw it out there.  Most women I know are<br>
very good at multi-tasking....ie, doing more than one thing at a time.<br>
I've read that there is an evolutionary "reason" for this, women developed<br>
it because they were the primary caregivers....I think I read something<br>
like this:  "A woman had to carry a baby on her hip, suckle it, stir the<br>
soup pot, and kick the mastadon out of the cave all at the same time."<br>
<i>&gt;From my own experience, I can be talking on the phone for instance and</i><br>
typing my email, paying attention to other things going on around me, etc.<br>
Or I can be knitting, watching TV, and keeping an ear out for a child I<br>
might be watching.  (In fact I normally don't like to watch TV unless I am<br>
engaged in another activity at the same time....).  Most mothers I know are<br>
able to perform many tasks at the same and always have an ear out for the<br>
kids.  I've not seen that many men can focus well on more than one activity<br>
at a time, and find that curious. One might say that this is genetically<br>
inclined, because the carpus collascum, (spell?) is more developed (% in<br>
size) in womens brains so the connectivity between the right and left<br>
hemispheres is better.... I recall reading that somewhere though I'm not<br>
really sure where.  I'll hunt for it on the web... Perhaps this is why<br>
women seem more inclined to intuitive hunches.... perhaps, perhaps,<br>
perhaps.  Does anyone out there with experience in the study of the brain<br>
have any thoughts on this?<br>
<p>
Peace!<br>
