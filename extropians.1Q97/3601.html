...hisssssssssssssssssss *click!*<br>
<p>
*** NewsSnip<br>
    brought to you with the Snippy Predictability of<br>
    STEVE<br>
    Editorial Director,<br>
    STEVENET NEWS CENTRAL G-rrrrrrOUCHdesk ***<br>
<p>
Isn't the drooling and panting over "push" technology truly amazing?<br>
<p>
"At last!  I can go back to being a couch potato!  The burdon of real<br>
choice was wearing me down!  Please!  Give me the false sense of choice<br>
I get from *subscribing* to something, then shower me in constant numbing<br>
stimulus!  I want to believe in 'news' again!"<br>
<p>
Yeah, having my computer be more like a TV is it, man, that's *IT*!<br>
Oh, orgasms, orgasms!  My heart's desire!<br>
<p>
Although I admit I've been entertained by the zip-zip-zip, here-it-is,<br>
there-it-is attract-mode style of PointCast, I can hardly believe the<br>
articles I'm seeing are written by people thinking seriously of themselves<br>
as--what, users? victims? beneficiaries? subjects? recipients?--of this<br>
technology.  Instead I get the feeling they either just love to "predict"<br>
the next obvious market success, or else they are seeing things from the<br>
point of view (and with the desperate hopes) of the dying-but-don't-<br>
realize-it-yet broadcast and serial print media.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Jesse Berst, Editorial Director,  ZDNet AnchorDesk</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Content will be king, dethroning technology. [...]</i><br>
<p>
Meaning, basically, "Content Providers" will be king, not<br>
those nerds who make technology.  Us media types will wrest back Control,<br>
instead of the world falling into that horrible, unfamiliar anarchy of<br>
individual choice and exploration that was threatening to happen.<br>
<p>
The whole media-business idea of "content" as this mass-produceable<br>
stuff, that you squeeze out of difficult "talent" and "newsmakers", or<br>
synthesize with the help of press secretaries, homogenize, and mix with<br>
ads and press releases, to be funnelled through channels to the public,<br>
fits *so* much more nicely with push technology, don't you think?  Now,<br>
finally things are starting to make *sense*...<br>
<p>
...to brains with incurable Hollywood syndrome.  It's as if the sharks<br>
in suits are getting into such a frenzy that they're forgetting their<br>
human masks.  It's embarrassing and yet strangely fascinating the way it<br>
confirms the old suspicions.  I mean, there really *are* aliens in our<br>
midst!  They Live while We Sleep.<br>
<p>
Sure, the idea that something outside should be able to initiate a transaction<br>
with, or even sustain a flow of information to my computer makes sense in a<br>
totally boring technical way.  Like, yawn, oh, you mean Netscape didn't<br>
already have that?  Huh, yawn, that's interesting.  Hey, and besides,<br>
*technically*, there's no reason operating systems *shouldn't* be able to<br>
handle the security and stability issues involved, instead of crashing<br>
the way they currently always do under the burdon of One More System<br>
Extension, or reporting your personal life--by accident, of course--to<br>
Prodigy or Microsoft central, right?  (Of course watching a computer<br>
crashed by PointCast was full half the entertainment value, I admit,<br>
I admit--The Tragic Fall!  Poom!)<br>
<p>
But when has my tongue itched so with the cliche, "Get real!"?<br>
<p>
(oh god tell me it's not Them that's real.)<br>
<p>
Tuning out,<br>

*click*, hissssssssssssss<br>
