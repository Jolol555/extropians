I haven't been inclined to strain my brain to follow most of the quantum<br>
computer thread, but I saw this in Discover magazine and thought it<br>
might be of interest not only to the QC folks but to the general nano<br>
crowd (apoologies if it slipped by me before).<br>
<p>
David Wineland and Chris Monroe at the National Institute of Standards<br>
and Technology in Boulder, CO have "managed to coax an atom to exist in<br>
two places at once".  They used lasers and a magnet to push the spin-down<br>
version of a beryllium atom ten atom-widths away from its spin-down self.<br>
It's fragile, but it's a start.  I, for one, am excited.  I find this at<br>
least as significant to nanotech as the atom laser.<br>
<p>
