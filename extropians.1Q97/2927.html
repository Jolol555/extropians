<i>&gt; From:          Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lcrocker@calweb.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; He says, "Insofar as there is a dominant belief in our society</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; today, it is a belief in the magic of the marketplace.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doctrine of laissez-faire capitalism hold that the common good is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; best served by the uninhibited pursuit of self-interrest.  Unless</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it is tempered by the recognition of a common interest that ought</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to take preference over particular interests, our present</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system--is liable to break down."</i><br>
[snip] <br>
<i>&gt;   a) "The free market can solve problems like crime, poverty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   defense..." b) "Government can solve problems like crime, poverty,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   defense..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Ask yourself which statement will get more agreement.  Without</i><br>
<i>&gt;   question, the latter.  So the "dominant belief" in society today</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is in government, not in the free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (2) Since he postulates that those who believe in the free market</i><br>
<i>&gt; say</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that it will magically solve all problems, and they are clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;   wrong, he asserts that government is superior.   First, he offers</i><br>
<i>&gt;   no evidence that capitalists actually believe that, or that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   conditions he describes (like "inequality") are actually problems,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   or that the free market's failures are more or fewer than</i><br>
<i>&gt;   government's, only that it isn't perfect.  Well Duh.  Life's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   bitch.  What else is new?</i><br>
<p>
He never claimed that anyone believes the marketplace can solve <br>
all problems, nor even that they believe that it can solve even one <br>
of the problems you use as an example, nor even that inequity is <br>
a problem except when taken to extremes.  In your attempt to show <br>
that the quoted author had presented a straw man fallacy, you <br>
presented a textbook example yourself.<br>
<p>
That the author committed a straw man fallacy is logically<br>
unsupportable within the context of the information that was given<br>
in the original post.  He was perhaps given to a bit of<br>
exaggeration, (Libertarians may not see government intervention as<br>
the "ultimate" evil) but I think that claiming this as evidence of a<br>
straw man fallacy would be reaching.  However, that you committed a<br>
straw man fallacy is logically irrefutable.  No additional<br>
information required.<br>
<p>
Have you allowed your emotional attachment to your beliefs interfere<br>
with your ability to reason?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And to top it all off, he sneaks "our present system" into the last</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentence, as if to suggest that our present system is capitalist!</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is one of the most thoroughly despicable essays I've read in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; long time.</i><br>
<p>
You are picking nits and evading the real issue.  He did not claim <br>
that it is 100% capitalist.  But it is more capitalistic than <br>
anything else, so to apply a single word to it without having to <br>
state percentages or produce some otherwise unecessarily belabored <br>
qualification, "capitalist" is a reasonably accurate description.  If <br>
you find rational argument to be so "dispicable", then perhaps you <br>
need to be offended more often.<br>
<p>
                                        Peace,<br>
                                        William Kitchen<br>
