This is a very reactionary chain letter and depressing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;DEATH OF AN INNOCENT</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I went to a party, Mom, I remembered what you said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though the others said I should.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I know I did the right thing, Mom, I know you are always right.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Now the party is finally ending, Mom, as everyone is driving out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  sight.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  As I got into my car, Mom, I knew I'd get home in one piece.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'm lying here dying, Mom.  I wish you'd get here soon.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  How could this happen to me, Mom?  My life just burst like a balloon.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  There is blood all around me, Mom, and most of it is mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I hear the medic say, Mom, I'll die in a short time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I just wanted to tell you, Mom, I swear I didn't drink.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It was the others, Mom.  The others didn't think.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  He was probably at the same party as I.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The only difference is, he drank and I will die.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why do people drink, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's fair.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.  Tell Daddy to be brave.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  And when I go to heaven, Mom, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  My breath is getting shorter, Mom.  I'm becoming very scared.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Please don't cry for me, Mom.  When I needed you, you were always</i><br>
<i>&gt;  there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I have one last question, Mom, before I say good bye.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;  Someone took the effort to write this poem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  So please, forward this to as many people as you can.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  And see if we can get a chain going around the world that will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  make people understand that drinking and driving don't mix.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, so please forward this letter</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to as many people as you can.</i><br>
