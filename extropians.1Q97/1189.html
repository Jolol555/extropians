<p>
I look forward to QueenMuse's response, although I'd like to drop in on this<br>
briefly.  Camille suffered from problems resulting from either depression<br>
or, possible, from an unhealthy environment.  No one knows for sure. Her<br>
behavior could have resulted from noxious dust particles from the marble<br>
scrapings. She lived in her studio. Camille became impoverished and<br>
increasingly isolated and was committed to a psychiatric hospital and<br>
remained a psychiatric patient for her life.<br>
<p>
The art world accepted her work at one point. It was short-lived, as her<br>
low-self image prevailed as a result of the environment, alcohol,<br>
mood-swings, etc. Unfortunately, she did not have female mentors with whom<br>
she could model. She was isolated.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;'mentality'.=20</i><br>
<p>
Her mental state was damaged, and she was not thinking clearly. It's a very<br>
sad story.  Her bravery, her incredible passion and talent and, untimately,<br>
her inner conflict.<br>
