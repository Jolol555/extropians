<i>&gt; I have also noticed in the course of my work that in most situations </i><br>
<i>&gt; where the speaker makes statements to the effect that the listener </i><br>
<i>&gt; should 'learn to develop a thicker skin', etc., the person on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; receiving end usually hears something that quite legitimately stirs </i><br>
<i>&gt; anger.  Simply demanding that people develop a greater tolerance for </i><br>
<i>&gt; what they perceive as ill treatment does nothing to promote a better </i><br>
<i>&gt; world, nor does it address the underlying problems.</i><br>
<p>
I don't doubt your perception, but I must say that mine is the<br>
opposite.  When I see someone upset by a statement, it is usually<br>
a simple, straightforward statement of fact or opinion.  A talk<br>
show host in SF recently said on the air "I believe the ethics of<br>
Jesus to be morally superior to the ethics of Judaism."  Jews<br>
everywhere were indignant, and demanded apologies or reprimands.<br>
Why?  They had no cause to take offense.  He believed that, he<br>
stated why he believed it.  I as an atheist took no offense, I<br>
merely disagree.  He behaved entirely appropriately as a talk show<br>
host by expressing his honestly held beliefs and explaing why.<br>
I have no respect for those who complained about it.<br>
<p>
Similar indignation arises any time someone makes a generalization<br>
about some gender, race, or other group.  Everyone knows that such<br>
generalizations are just that: that they imply nothing more or less<br>
than what is said, that there are always exceptions, that they make<br>
no implications about different rights or priveleges, they're just<br>
generalizations. <br>
<p>
Sometimes, one must be deliberately provocative to shake out the<br>
mental cobwebs of "common knowledge" with new ideas.  Dry, plodding<br>
arguments for slowly changing, say, the drug war, might eventually<br>
lead the right direction: but wouldn't people be more likely to<br>
hear and respond to more direct attack: It is morally repugnant to<br>
jail an innocent drug user.  The fact that tobacco is legal and<br>
marijuana is not was racially motivated.  You /don't/ have the right<br>
to vote on what I can and cannot put into my body.  The LP once<br>
wrote a press release against the bill that mandated HMOs to keep<br>
mothers in the hospital for two days.  Knowing that it was one of<br>
those meaningless feelgood everybody's happy kind of bills that<br>
most people would give a second thought to, they titled the release<br>
"Against Motherhood", to provoke thought and discussion.<br>
<p>
I am not suggesting that one walk up to every stranger on the street<br>
and say "Hey, you're fat and ugly."  What I am suggesting is that if<br>
someone asks the direct question "Do you think I'm too fat?", then he<br>
has no right to complain when someone honestly answers "Yes."  I am<br>
suggesting that when a researcher finds an interesting piece of data<br>
like "Men are much better at this certain test than women", it is far<br>
better to examine the data, investigate its causes, and postulate <br>
solutions than it is to take offense, dismiss the data and the man who<br>
found it as nonsense, and ignore it.<br>
<p>
When you say that simply suggesting that people develop a thinker<br>
skin does help "the underlying problem", you evade the point I am<br>
trying to make: thin skin /is/ the problem.  It /is/ the cause of<br>
reactions that get in the way of free inquiry.  It /is/ the cause of<br>
people who shut off communication instead of working to resolve<br>
issues rationally.<br>
<p>
I am sure there are also speakers with hateful motives, and that<br>
may be a problem as well, but to automatically assume such when one<br>
is offended is to avoid finding the truth: maybe your reaction was<br>
justified, maybe it wasn't.  But if the words weren't said in the<br>
first place, we'd never know.<br>
<p>
One of the saddest sights I ever saw was a grown man talking to his<br>
mother.  They were unfailingly polite; she baked cookies, he praised<br>
them.  She complemented how his house building was going.  They<br>
chatted about landscaping.  They were complete strangers, and not<br>
even interested in each others lives, other than to fill their duty<br>
to each other as family and smile and nod.<br>
<p>
My mother knows I like my sister's cookies better than hers.  I know<br>
she doesn't like who I date.  She knows I'd like to have a different<br>
job.  I know her husband drives her crazy sometimes.  We have a<br>
wonderful, healthy, loving, complete relationship--and it is no<br>
accident that neither of us feels the least restraint in saying things<br>
that might be upsetting.  She tells me I'm too fat; I tell her she's<br>
too nosy.  That's what a healthy relationship is.<br>
