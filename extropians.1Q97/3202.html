<i>&gt;Revolution (civil war) in Albania, because of a Pyramid system!</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Pyramid schemes are usually considered fraud, not trade. Fraud is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;a distinguishing feature of capitalism, since it is just as common (if</i><br>
<i>&gt;not more so) under noncapitalistic systems. Free trade is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;distinguishing trait of capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker.<br>
<i>&gt;Your only</i><br>
<i>&gt;detail here is to describe something as a "Pyramid system", which is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not the least bit capitalist.  Fraud is a crime in a free market.</i><br>
<p>
Ho wait, i didn't mean to say fraud was inherent to capitalist systems. But<br>
isn't relying on companies who commit fraud today on a daily basis, to<br>
protect you from fraud when payed, a little naive ? <br>
<p>
The main concern i still have with a complete free market, stateless system<br>
is social stability, which i believe is just as important for a growing<br>
economy as a free market. Just thought a current example migth give more<br>
insight in these matters. Guess it was a little too controversial ? ;-) <br>
