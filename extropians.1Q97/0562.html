I was struck by this following passage from Albert Einstein which <br>
seems somewhat relevant both to Eliezer's Algernon's Law idea and to <br>
the recent debate about whether we already have all the fundamental <br>
concepts of science down and the rest is *just engineering*.<br>
<p>
&lt;I sometimes ask myself, how did it come that I was the one to develop <br>
the Theory of Relativity? The reason, I think, is that a normal adult <br>
never stops to think about problems of space and time.  These are <br>
things which he has thought of as a child.  But my intellectual <br>
development was retarded, as a result of which I began to wonder about <br>
space and time only when I had already grown up.  Naturally, I could <br>
go deeper into the problem than a child.&gt;<br>

P.S.<br>
<p>
I like to think I'm in a similar situation with regards to <br>
mathematics.  I'm currently reading a book that deals directly with <br>
the issue of formalisms, Turing machines, Godel's Incompleteness <br>
Theorem, and their applicability to _Life Itself_. That is the book's <br>
name (the subtitle is "A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, <br>
Origin, and Fabrication of Life").   This is a listing of some of the <br>
chapters: 2. Strategic Considerations: The Special and the General; 3. <br>
Some Necessary Epistemological Considerations; 4. The Concept of <br>
State; 5. Entailment Without States: Relational Biology; 6. Analytic <br>
and Synthetic Models; 9. Relational Theory of Machines; 11. Relational <br>
Biology and Biology.<br>
<p>
Some may recall that I've mentioned this book before. Well, I'm now <br>
actually working my way through it and I hope to provide a review once <br>
I'm 'sure' I've assimulated the author's arguments. (The author is, <br>
BTW, Robert Rosen, a professor of physiology and biopyhsics at <br>
Dalhousie University.)<br>
<p>
Just in case your want to set up kill files ahead of time, Rosen <br>
challenges strong reductionism suggesting that:<br>
&lt;with respect to biological phenomena, contemporary physics is in <br>
exactly the same situation that 19th-century physics faced in the <br>
atomic and cosmological realms: it either stands mute or it gives <br>
wrong answers.... Once again, as in all similar situations in the <br>
past, the claim is that purely technical matters are involved and that <br>
the problem is simply one of specializing what already exists in an <br>
appropriate way.  But history shows it to be at least equally likely <br>
that the problems are not technical but conceptual, that contemporary <br>
physics remains too special to accommodate the class of material <br>
systems we call organisms.&gt;<br>
<p>
Still, given this view, Rosen certainly doesn't just "give up and go <br>
to church"! BTW, the book was written in 1991 as part of the Columbia <br>
University Press, Ecological Systems Series, and I don't think it <br>
takes much of recent A-life research into account.<br>
