Lee Daniel Crocker said, "Trying to communicate with someone "from their point <br>
of view" implicitly validates that point of view.  If their views or their <br>
epistemology are irrational, they can just as easily wiggle their way out of <br>
your idea with their own methods, or [if] they accept your result, they may <br>
use your words to validate their own ideas."<br>
<p>
You're quite right.  However, since I'm not trying to pin anyone down with <br>
arguments, I don't care if they "wiggle their way out of [my] idea".  You seem <br>
to be approaching this from a debating standpoint, that your purpose in a <br>
conversation is to prove that you are right and that the other person is <br>
wrong.  From that standpoint, validating your opponent's point of view by <br>
communicating with them as though you accept their assumptions *is* a losing <br>
strategy.  But that's not the approach *I* take with conversations.<br>
<p>
I used to play the "I'm  right and you're wrong!" game quite vigorously, <br>
having long drawn-out arguments with people.  These exchanges were lots of fun <br>
for me, but it was upsetting to lots of other people, who didn't enjoy talking <br>
to me very much because I would always draw them into an argument.  I also <br>
realized that the person I was arguing with was trying to establish their <br>
point just as hard as I was trying to establish mine.  Ultimately, neither of <br>
us were going to be convinced by the arguments of the other, because we had <br>
determined at the outset that we were right.  Our minds were closed to each <br>
other as we each *essentially* tried to convince the other that they were an <br>
idiot.<br>
<p>
Now, I am very careful to not put people in a defensive state of mind and to <br>
coax them out of it if they get into one.  When they go into this state of <br>
mind, they are closed to what I have to say to them.  I don't see people who <br>
think differently than I do as my enemy, and I am careful that they don't <br>
perceive me as their enemy.  My goal is not to establish my superiority over <br>
them and to show them how wrong their belief system is.  I am more concerned <br>
with building a healthy relationship with others.  Eventually, they trust me <br>
and listen to me, and I can talk to them about my ideas, and they will be open <br>
to them, and I will also understand very well how they see things and why they <br>
prefer to see things that way.<br>
<p>
When I talk with someone from *within* their belief system,  I *am* certainly <br>
lending credibility to their way of thinking, which is fine, since my main <br>
goal is not to smash their belief system before their eyes,  but to develop a <br>
healthy relationship with them and to help them work their way out of whatever <br>
pathological belief systems they are in.  When I talk with people about their <br>
beliefs, I get them thinking rationally about them.  I ask lots of questions, <br>
in an honest attempt to understand what they believe and why.  Most people <br>
seem more than willing to share their ideas with me, especially since I'm not <br>
attacking their ideas but am genuinely interested in them.  My hope is that <br>
they will eventually start asking themselves the same type of questions on <br>
their own.  More than anything, I am trying to provide people with a template <br>
for asking questions, for rational inquiry.  By conversing with me, they will <br>
pick up on my ways of thinking and questioning, and they will start to apply <br>
those ways of thinking and questioning to their own belief systems.  If their <br>
belief systems are flawed, *they* will realize that on their own as they <br>
question themselves.  *I* won't have to point out the error of their ways; <br>
they will see it for themselves and adjust their approach automatically.  <br>
<p>
My intent is to provide people with the thinking tools they need to get <br>
themselves out of whatever flawed belief systems they find themselves in.  *I* <br>
may see when someone's belief system is flawed, but that doesn't help *them*.  <br>
They need to see the flaws for themselves.  <br>
<p>
Letting go of a cherished belief system, however irrational and flawed, can be <br>
quite painful for people.  There are generally very strong emotional reasons <br>
for people adopting their belief systems.  Most people's belief systems seem <br>
to be a sort of psychological "coping mechanism", a way to deal with terrible <br>
things.  People are essentially addicted to their belief systems.  It's not <br>
surprising that they become defensive when they feel their belief system is <br>
under attack.<br>
<p>
I look at people with their damaging belief systems about the same way I look <br>
at people with drug problems.  I try to act like an Alcoholics Anonymous <br>
counseler:  I talk with people about their beliefs, *from their point of <br>
view*, trying to help them work out their problem *from the inside*.  They <br>
must understand the nature of their problem before they can move beyond it.  <br>
Saying "Bad boy!  You have a flawed belief system!  How could you do such a <br>
thing?!"  tends to drive people deeper into their belief systems, to cling <br>
tighter, to try to get more comfort from it.  If I *attack* their belief <br>
system, they will try to *defend* it and tighten their grip on it.<br>
<p>
It seems like the first step is to help people get comfortable *questioning* <br>
their own belief systems and sincerely trying to understand their own belief <br>
systems better.  One way to do this is to talk with them about their beliefs, <br>
honestly trying to understand them yourself.  As you ask them deeper and <br>
deeper questions, and discuss various issues with them, they become more <br>
comfortable talking about their belief systems and looking at them honestly.<br>
<p>
Then, if you've given them examples of how to think rationally, by having <br>
rational discussions with them on various issues, including their own belief <br>
systems, they will have the proper mental tools to work themselves out of <br>
their pathological belief systems, if they are indeed pathological.<br>
<p>
I basically view pathological belief systems as a form of mental illness which <br>
the individual must ultimately work their own way out of.  I try to do what I <br>
can to help people develop more rational and successful belief systems to use <br>
as powerful tools to accomplish their goals.  <br>
