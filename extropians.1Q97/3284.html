[BTW, there is a web page now, <a href="http://www.fourthturning.com">http://www.fourthturning.com</a>.  The details<br>
of the cycles I describe below came from here.]<br>
<p>
It's hard to judge the accuracy of the cycles picked out in this book<br>
and the earlier Generations unless you know history well.  What were<br>
things really like in the 1910's, the 1870's?  The authors describe<br>
events which fit pretty well into the cycles, but who knows whether<br>
they are being selective?  One solution would be to look at what other<br>
historians say about this work.  Does anyone here have information about<br>
what the authors' peers say?<br>
<p>
I did notice a few areas in which their cycles did not seem to work very<br>
well.  They identify a cyclic period which extends from the beginning of<br>
the Depression until the end of WWII, roughly the 1930's and early 40's;<br>
the next period encompasses the post-war years up until the early 1960's;<br>
then we have the social unrest of the 60's up through the mid 1980's,<br>
and finally we have the current period, from 1984 through the early<br>
2000's, which is a recap of the 30's and WWII.  This should terminate<br>
with another crisis analogous to WWII, around 2005.<br>
<p>
Looking at recent times, I'm not sure it fits.  The authors have a<br>
break at the re-election of Ronald Reagan in 1984, the "Morning in<br>
America" campaign.  Since then we are supposedly in a period of malaise,<br>
uncertainty, discontent, which will culminate in this crisis which is<br>
coming up.  But I don't really perceive there to have been a change<br>
in the national mood in the middle 1980's, nor for the period up until<br>
then to have been a continuation of the 1960's.  In fact, it's hard for<br>
me to imagine anyone looking at recent history and outlining the period<br>
from 1964 to 1984 as having a coherent national mood, distinct from that<br>
which follows.<br>
<p>
There was a huge difference between the social unrest of 1964-1974 and<br>
later years.  Beyond that the 70's were a largely forgettable decade,<br>
with none of the energy and spirit of the 1960's.  Jimmy Carter lost his<br>
presidency largely because he complained of a "malaise" infecting the<br>
American spirit.  I don't recall a shift in mood in the middle 1980's,<br>
either.  It certainly didn't seem like the final end of the "age of<br>
aquarius", the death of the hippie.  That had happened long before.<br>
<p>
Then, they have to compare the present day with the Great Depression.<br>
This doesn't fit at all.  Yes, there is uncertainty, worry, concern;<br>
new technologies (the net, biotech) are forcing people to adjust.<br>
But people have been talking about this all my life.  Future Shock was<br>
written in 1970.<br>
<p>
We face nothing like the challenges and hardships people had to deal with<br>
from 1929 through 1946.  Trying to map this to 1984 through 2005 doesn't<br>
seem to work well at all.  At best we can postulate that something will<br>
happen which will make us pull together as people did during that phase,<br>
but it doesn't seem to me that we are going into the next decade with<br>
the same emotional attitudes that people must have had after ten grinding<br>
years of severe economic hardship.<br>
<p>
Some of authors' characterizations do work pretty well; the can-do era<br>
of the postwar years is distinctly different from the earlier and later<br>
times.  Whether that really matches some 19th century period, I have no<br>
idea.  But the more recent periods don't fit well with my memories and<br>
perceptions.<br>
