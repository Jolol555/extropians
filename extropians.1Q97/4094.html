<p>
I don't think gradual uploading is possible, nor do I buy the <br>
nanoressurrection scenario (I'll believe in drextech when I see solid <br>
evidence, like an experiment-validated STM tip chemistry calculation, and <br>
full dynamics study of a realistic diamondoid cantilever). Cryopreservation <br>
artefacts are far easier to DSP-filter, than refurbishing the actual <br>
physical structures atom-by-atom, molecule-by-molecule, especially in <br>
nonvitrified state, where you have to race deterioration, and introduce <br>
new artefacts by just being there. (GIANT worms come in diminuitive <br>
packages. That's nanotechology, in a nutshell).<br>
<p>
In contrast, consider a parallel molecular-resolution scan of a myriad <br>
vitrified brain specimens. By applying contrasting erosion techniques,<br>
as vacuum sublimation (removes water, lets macromolecules intact), UV <br>
flash photolysis etch (tune energy to lyse certain brand of bonds, e.g. <br>
lyse C-C covalents, yet let ice relatively intact), plasma etch, and AFM <br>
imaging of thusly abraded surface an arbitrarily detailed map of the <br>
actual circuitry can be constructed. The resulting voxelset can be ANN <br>
DSPeed to remove vitrification and scan artefact, do contrasting, <br>
segmentation, etc. By processing voxel slabs on the fly, retaining <br>
merely salient, efficiently encoded features (connectivity, geometry, <br>
also both class and individual instance properties), the amount of fast <br>
storage necessary can be reduced to relatively modest amounts (don't get <br>
me wrong, it's still many GBytes). The processed data set would fit in a <br>
roomful of next-generation optical tape cartridges. Now if we only knew <br>
what the minimal salient feature set is...<br>
<p>
Consider a neural net cultured on an electrode-grid silicon chip, which <br>
can both activate and multi-channel-record the electrical activity of the <br>
NN. By AFM in vivo, detailed local knowledge about geometry and <br>
activity can be gathered. Now vitrify the specimen, and do either a <br>
straight "ab initio" upload, or GA reverse-engineer a system with exactly <br>
the same state space behaviour. A translation stage (which might consist <br>
of GA breeding the code circuitry, target code to be run on the virtual <br>
machine, which in turn is run on molecular hardware (which is so <br>
braindead, it can be run directly by this spacetime's physics, whatever <br>
that might run or not run on).<br>
<p>
We will soon have Mrs Drosophila m.'s genome completely sequenced, and adult <br>
specimens are of a handy size to be imaged by above means in one piece. <br>
By modeling DNA/protein activations, part of cell's machinery, we can <br>
unravel the morphogenetic code, causing neurons and glias to organize. I <br>
think we might witness realtime insect emulations (uploads) in some 50 <br>
years, perhaps even sooner. How long after that to human-scale uploads? I <br>
do not know. Frankly, building &gt;H ALife Golems from scratch appears much <br>
easier.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; uploading will be possible later, than lives patients. Why the</i><br>
<i>&gt; super intelligent uploaded civiliation should upload the primitives</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryo-patients?</i><br>
<p>
An excellent question, to which I do not know the anwer. However, by <br>
being preserved and not composted beyond any hope of retrieval, does seem <br>
to increase the probablity of being at all uploaded. We're talking of future <br>
posthuman entities (so treat current toddlers with respect, you may owe <br>
them quite a favour) motivation, not acts of physical magick, like <br>
spacetime engineering (anybody which is capable of that, is as much <br>
beyond us as we are beyond a rhabdovirus), or Omega tinkering. I don't <br>
like to rely on hypthetical gods, then rather give me meek mehum engineering.<br>
gods'r'us, sure, but give it a few hundred years more time.<br>
