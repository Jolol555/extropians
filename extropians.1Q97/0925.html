The concern about strange matter is overblown.  First, if small<br>
nuggets of strange matter are stable (this is doubted), then they<br>
would have a large Coulomb barrier at their surfaces, estimated<br>
to be around 50 MeV.  This would prevent ordinary nuclei from<br>
being absorbed and converted into strange quark matter under usual<br>
conditions.<br>
<p>
Second, if we could create these nuggets in accelerators, then they<br>
have certainly been created by cosmic ray collisions in the <br>
atmosphere or on meteorites, and so these nuggets would have been<br>
around from before the Earth's formation.  Also, stable strange <br>
matter means that neutron stars are actually strange stars, and so<br>
strange star/strange star collisions (as occur when close binary <br>
systems decay by gravitational radiation, as will occur to the binary <br>
pulsar in about 100 Myr) should eject substantial quantities of<br>
strange debris into interstellar space, which should get swept up in <br>
the formation of stars and planets.<br>
<p>
The current bet is that strange matter is not stable at zero <br>
pressure, since it's hard to understand how a strange pulsar could <br>
undergo "glitches" (which are thought to be due, in ordinary pulsars, <br>
to phenomena associated with the degenerate  normal matter crust,<br>
which would mostly not exist in a completely strange star.)<br>
