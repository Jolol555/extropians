Sorry to disagree with you Reilly, but I have to say that Stove's<br>
critique of Popper is complete bollocks - much as I enjoy Stove's acidic<br>
style.<br>
<p>
The point of 'falsifiability' is this: if you are serious about using<br>
experience to test theory then the only way you can *logically* do so is<br>
deductively: you deduce empirical consequences from a theory, and if<br>
those experiences don't pan out, then the theory logically *must* be false.<br>
<p>
But there is no such thing as a*logic* of induction: there is no<br>
logical*necessity* to induction, no logical 'must', like you get in<br>
deduction: this is what Hume showed.  (BTW, you can't escape this by the<br>
Aristotelian/Randian route, because the truth of your theoretical<br>
construct then depends upon the correctness of your identifications,<br>
begging the question in a different way.)<br>
<p>
If you think 'conjectural knowledge' is an oxymoron, then you must be<br>
thinking of 'knowledge' as 'justified true belief'.  This isn't the way<br>
Popperians think of knowledge.  For Popper, knowledge is simply<br>
systematic truth.  Nowhere does he deny that we have got a hold of some<br>
systematic truth, nowhere does he deny that it is possible to arrive at<br>
systematic truth.<br>
<p>
How that truth was arrived at is irrelevant to its epistemological<br>
status as knowledge: if it's true it's true, because the world is the way<br>
it is, full stop. In fact the 'justified' and 'true belief' parts of the<br>
traditional definition are precisely what lead to subjectivism and<br>
irrationalism, to the continuous oscillation betweeen scepticism and<br>
dogmatism in the Western tradition.<br>
<p>
Of course, the 'justified' bit was an attempt to distinguish mere lucky<br>
guesses from truths arrived at by some sort of rational process.  The<br>
problem is, the rational process is not 'justification'  but*criticism*.<br>
<p>
Popper's idea is that we ought to test our ideas to destruction. What's<br>
left standing isn't thereby 'justified' or 'proved' true beyond any<br>
further doubt, but is the best candidate we have for truth: after all,<br>
what other candidate for truth do we have?<br>
<p>
The upshot is, unless you believe in some queer magical connection<br>
between what we say and the way the world is such that there is some<br>
logically necessary link between them (which denies the very principle<br>
of objectivity, which says that there is *no* such logically necessary<br>
connection, that the world exists the way it does independently of our<br>
whims, our thoughts and theories) you*must* (logically!) be a Popperian.<br>
<p>
To put it bluntly, we just make stuff up, and then we test it against<br>
experience.<br>
<p>
