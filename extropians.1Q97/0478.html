Sure but how many are in existence. The US does have the SLAM glide<br>
bomb, which is effective for bunkers 200 feet down, but thats a 1000 lb<br>
warhead. The capability is there, but not the actual devices for deep<br>
nuke penetration. In any event, the current BMDO technologies on the<br>
drawing boards now and being tested now are fully sufficient to counter<br>
incoming ballistic weapons on the Moon. The fact that the moon has no<br>
atmosphere makes lunar ground based beam weapons also ideal for<br>
defending a large linear induction gun, as they can run on the same<br>
power source that is used by the gun for launching, so they are not<br>
limited in power. Orbiting beam weapons are limited in power due to<br>
weight restricions of launch vehicles.<br>
<p>
His assertions of insurgencies orchestrated by the CIA/NSA etc. are also<br>
vacuous, as intelligence is a two edged sword. being able to control who<br>
goes where (all that vacuum helps)really helps in maintaining the<br>
integrity of restricted access zones. Placing the gun far enough away to<br>
make a suited traverse difficult, thus requiring access to traced<br>
vehicles is sufficient. beyond that, any computer penetration by agents<br>
would most likely be opposed by a lunar colonie's IT security people,<br>
who would likely be former hackers who were booted off earth.<br>
Considering the present ineffectuality of establishment security people<br>
here on earth, I doubt they will develop a level of superiority in the<br>
interim.<br>
<p>
As much lunar mobilization will be underground, observation satellites<br>
will be useless, while Terrans almost never do anything underground. His<br>
assertions of developing HumInt assets within the colony are also<br>
specious, seeing the past 40 years intelligence communities inability to<br>
develop HumInt here on earth to any degree of reliability. Terran Intel<br>
relies heavily on Sigint &amp; Opsint analysis. Look at our inability to do<br>
anything with the Iran Hostages, or to see Iraqs invasions.<br>
Additionally, now that the cold war has ended, one can do a serious<br>
analysis of what areas of intelligence the Soviets were strong and weak<br>
in, as well as the US. Where they went wrong and why. Using this data,<br>
one can develop more secure operations.<br>
