<i>&gt;Subject: Things that go faster than light</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What about the logical paradoxes that would result from communicating with </i><br>
<i>&gt;the past, wouldn't that be enough to rule out Tachyons?</i><br>
<p>
No.<br>
Some thing happening in a past you did not live will not affect you.<br>
If I was planning to go into the past to kill my parents,<br>
It would be my future, not my past.<br>
Being there (in the "past") makes it my present, <br>
and being a representative of the present, <br>
my past (it's future) is it's( the present's ) past.<br>
You probably have to read that a few times.<br>
The present's future happened in it's past.<br>
Yet, the past only exists because it is being replayed in the present<br>
(but that's beside the point).<br>
[just for fun I will say,"The present's future happenED in it's present."]<br>
If you are confused start thinking of time as space.<br>
<p>
It is space-time to learn about space-time.<br>
The time period (as a static mold not evolving) <br>
is only made of it's spacial structures.<br>
(Space-time - time = space.)<br>
Going back in time is really just going to a space like your "past"<br>
(the space you are *presently* imagining and calling past).<br>
So, by that, time-space travel seems possible.<br>
<p>
hmm...think about this...<br>
time does not exist without space,<br>
space does not exist without time.<br>
What is 0 + 0, and why do I try to disprove existance?<br>
&lt;sigh&gt;I hate it when I do this.<br>
I hope some one understands.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It would if anybody </i><br>
<i>&gt;saw them,</i><br>
<p>
So they can exist as long as no one knows?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox. Pardon me, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be </i><br>
<i>&gt;careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it over." </i><br>
<p>
Why talk to your self telepathicly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;safe place. It was nice of John to warn me about it, it's too bad that means</i><br>
<i>&gt;oblivion for him and his entire universe but that's life,</i><br>
<p>
If that were true <br>
he would be obliviated long before he ever sent you a message.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;nature just will </i><br>
<i>&gt;not allow anybody to observe a paradox.</i><br>
