Following this thread I was reminded of a theory by the Popperian<br>
historian and philosopher Peter Munz, to the effect that irrational<br>
memes (he doesn't use that word, but it's translatable) that wouldn't<br>
have any survival value to a Robinson Crusoe have survival value to<br>
groups, thus: the more irrational the meme, the more value it has as a<br>
social solidarity mechanism, to strongly differentiate one group from<br>
another.  Rather like peacocks' tails and all that.<br>
<p>
This can work because the division of labour cushions us from the<br>
deleterious effects irrational memes would otherwise have. <br>
<p>
Munz sees the rise of Enlightenment/scientific type memes as the<br>
detachment of ideas from their use as tools of social solidarity, and<br>
the consideration of ideas of truth and rationality in their own right.<br>
<p>
(I'm writing this from memory, so I might not have got it quite right. <br>
I hope the gist comes across.)<br>
