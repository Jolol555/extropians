In my last post, I declared that we *are* that which we are experiencing in <br>
this moment, that there is no division between the one experiencing and the <br>
experience itself.  After reading the responses to my last post, and after <br>
considering more deeply my understanding of things, I realize that what I <br>
wrote was much too superficial; there is much more to consider than just the <br>
fact that we *are* our momentary experiences.  We certainly are *that*, but <br>
there are aspects of ourselves which are present through many moments, which <br>
last longer than a sensation or a fleeting thought; aspects which are <br>
*influenced* by all the sensations and fleeting thoughts, but which persist in <br>
their own, stable ways.<br>
<p>
There are aspects of ourselves which change very quickly, such as the sounds <br>
we hear or the sights we see; colors and tones rise and fall, shifting with <br>
each moment; thoughts come and go, emotions surge and fade.  But there are <br>
other aspects which change more slowly; our personalities develop into <br>
somewhat stable habits of thought and action, changing, certainly, but <br>
changing slowly.  The basic patterns of human thinking and culture have <br>
persisted through many generations, our language and customs being passed from <br>
parent to child, maintaining their *basic* forms, even as they mutate in <br>
important ways.  Other aspects, such as the chemical processes of our cells; <br>
the duplication of DNA, the formation of protiens, the constant metabolism; <br>
these processes change *much* more slowly; the same basic *pattern* has <br>
spanned millions of generations.  Even slower to change is the behavior of our <br>
atoms;  they've been doing the same familiar dance for billions of years, <br>
altering their pattern of action very little, if any, since they first formed <br>
and settled into their habitual ways.  The Deep Regularities of Physics, so <br>
deep and so regular that we call them Laws, seem to change the slowest of all, <br>
if indeed *at* all, the slow background pattern underlying all the other, <br>
dancing patterns we call our universe.<br>
<p>
We embody *all* these changing patterns, from the constantly flowing barrage <br>
of momentary sensations, to the steady presence of the universe's underlying <br>
regularity.  Such a rich complexity of patterns, each built on a slower, <br>
deeper pattern; each building up, combining to form something new; happening <br>
upon new stabilities, drawing more coherent patterns out of the noise.  The <br>
unstable falls away, because of it's very nature, and that which is able to <br>
persist, does.  The evolution continues in its characteristically haphazard <br>
way, and all that persists are those processes which are able to sustain <br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
What are we?  We are this *process*.  All these levels of shifting patterns, <br>
interacting with each other to form the complex and transitory patterens that <br>
we are; some more transitory than others, but all of them changing.<br>
<p>
So perhaps it *does* make some sense to say that there is someone *having* <br>
experiences, since our slower changing aspects,  like our personalities, <br>
*persist* as the momentary sensations and thoughts flutter around them like <br>
flies around elephants.  Is the personality the same pattern as the momentary <br>
experiences?  Not really.  There is no clear *division* between them, but they <br>
change at different rates; they live on different scales of time.  They <br>
interact and shape each other to some degree, and they are part of the same <br>
overall pattern of existence, but they each have their own distinct features.  <br>
<p>
<p>
We are this very moment of experience; we are the fleeting sensations as well <br>
as the more *subtle* patterns of personality, culture, metabolism, chemistry <br>
and physics.  All are present in this moment, together, and all have a deep <br>
influence on the *exact qualities* of the moment we are experiencing.<br>
<p>
But what about death?  What happens to us *then*?  Much of the complex pattern <br>
that we are disappears, patterns which rose and fell, like our momentary <br>
sensations and thoughts.  To the slower-changing patterns, such as the <br>
personality, the rising and falling of sensations and thoughts is commonplace <br>
and hardly disturbing.  To even slower-changing patterns, such as culture and <br>
the basic metabolism of humanity, the rising and falling of personalities and <br>
individual bodies is common-place and rarely disturbing.  Our personalities <br>
will continue on, even though our current sensations and thoughts will die <br>
away, and so will the rest of life after our personalities and bodies have <br>
disintegrated.  The parts of ourselves that change more slowly, such as the <br>
basic patterns of metabolism and physics, will continue to live on, even after <br>
our personalities and bodies die.<br>
<p>
As far as I know, the parts of ourselves which are our personalities are no <br>
longer active after the death of the body.  I see no reason why that <br>
particular kind of pattern should persist, when the types of patterns which <br>
are our momentary sensations do not.  It *may* be that every pattern which has <br>
ever existed within this universe exists forever, and thus nothing dies, not <br>
even the slightest sensation or vibration of an atom, but if not, I see no <br>
reason why *personalities* would remain active while *other* transient <br>
patterns do not.  And even if personalities *do* continue after death, in what <br>
manner do they continue?  How do they relate to the patterns which they were <br>
so intimate with, such as their bodily metabolism and the structure of their <br>
brain, when those are gone?  The personality was not something *isolated*; it <br>
existed within a complex web of relationships between culture, experience, <br>
body, chemistry and physics.  How can it exist outside of this complex web?  <br>
The personality was so embedded in these relationships; these relationships <br>
shaped it and defined it; without them, it has no existence.<br>
<p>
Our personalities, of course, want to persist as long as possible.  They do <br>
not want to die.  Of course, they will inevitably change over time, and given <br>
enough time to change, they may become transformed into something quite <br>
*different*.  This type of steady changing is not really all that troubling to <br>
the personalities; it's the sudden *stop* in the flow that worries us.<br>
<p>
How to avoid that sudden *stop* is our problem.  It's an old problem, and it's <br>
been worked on by many personalities, and many personalities are still working <br>
on it.  Living healthily and safely is a solution for living *longer*, but not <br>
long enough to avoid stopping.  So more radical approaches are being explored, <br>
ideas like continual cell repair through nanotechnology, uploading the <br>
personality into a more robust system, and replacing body parts with <br>
longer-lasting and upgradable machines.  But *whatever* approaches prove <br>
themselves to be successful in allowing the personality to live on and change <br>
at its own pace, the personality must *always* exist within a complex web of <br>
shifting patterns and relationships between those patterns.  <br>
<p>
<p>
There are only patterns, shifting.  Some change faster than others, dancing <br>
upon the underlying slowness.  The patterns relate to each other, forming new <br>
patterns, often growing in complexity, often shifting suddenly into other <br>
patterns.  We, ourselves, are shifting patterns, a part of the whole, <br>
elaborate, interconnected pattern.  Certain aspects of ourselves are transient <br>
and ephemeral, while the deeper aspects are more lasting.  The constant flow <br>
of patterns; existence<br>
