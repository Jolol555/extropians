<i>&gt; I agree that there is no way, absolutely no way Einstein would say there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; " a zero spacetime interval" between Earth and the virgo cluster, but what</i><br>
<i>&gt; about Cramer? If Cramer were to say there was a zero time difference between </i><br>
<i>&gt; earth and what we see in the Virgo cluster then time does not change, it also </i><br>
<i>&gt; stops being a useful concept, but I still see the symbol "t" , for time in </i><br>
<i>&gt; his equations, and he sure doesn't treat it like a constant equal to zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the spatial distance to the Virgo cluster is zero then the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; distance never changes and is always equal to zero, but you see the symbol</i><br>
<i>&gt; "L" for length in his equations and he sure doesn't treat it like a constant</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal to zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If there was " a zero spacetime interval" between Earth and the virgo cluster,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then all of spacetime would be a single mathematical point, points have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; internal structure so the idea of spacetime would not be a useful concept.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the answer to this problem is that distance is path-dependent. If<br>
you take a spacelike path from here to the Virgo cluster, the spacetime<br>
length isn't zero, but if you proceed along Earth's future light-cone<br>
to a point where it intersects the Virgo cluster's future light-cone,<br>
and follow a lightlike trajectory backwards in time into the Virgo cluster<br>
itself, you've travelled on two paths, each of which has spacetime "length"<br>
of zero.<br>
<p>
I think bidirectional local causality is an ingenious idea, but what <br>
bothers me about the transactional interpretation when it's compared to, <br>
say, Bohm's theory, is that it doesn't really have an exact mathematical<br>
formulation yet. Cramer suggests that you could decompose a wavefunction <br>
into advanced and retarded components which altogether constitute a <br>
back-and-forth-in-time "causal sequence", but nowhere that I have seen <br>
does he propose a formula or an algorithm for such decomposition.<br>
<p>
Something I'd like to figure out: how the operation of quantum computers<br>
would be understood in the transactional interpretation. Would it be <br>
that the readout operation retrocausally determines which computations<br>
are performed...? John Cramer has e-mail, I'll ask him what HE thinks.<br>
