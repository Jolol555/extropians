I've been thinking about this very issue lately:<br>
Is there hope for the Meaning of Life?<br>
<p>
And my conclusion:  Yes, but backing that statement up requires way,<br>
way, way too much unpublished material.<br>
<p>
My general conclusion is that engineering an ontologically objective<br>
self-justifying goal requires solving both the First Cause and the hard<br>
problem of conscious experience.<br>
<p>
First, why engineering as opposed to discovering?<br>
Because unlike the Universe and qualia, I have nothing to point to for<br>
my "hard problem of ethics."<br>
<p>
Second, why the First Cause?<br>
So that we can make objectively real self-justifying things.<br>
<p>
Third, why conscious experience?<br>
Goal requires purpose.  Purpose requires agent.  Agent requires<br>
subjectivity.  Therefore conscious experiences or, more likely, an<br>
engineered variant thereof.<br>
<p>
Probability of success:  Between 20% and 70%, depending on how<br>
optimistic I'm feeling that day.<br>
<p>
Depressing side-note:  Explains the Great Silence if all civilizations<br>
achieve Singularity and commit suicide.  Better hope that intelligent<br>
life is really improbable or that lightspeed is an absolute limit. <br>
Aren't wormholes and those newly discovered planets and life on Mars<br>
depressing?  Personally, I go for the "really improbable" explanation.<br>
<p>
Weird idea:  We, as future Powers, could resolve to destroy all of<br>
Reality if we find out that life is meaningless.  If all others follow<br>
the same logic, this reduces to zero the chance that previous<br>
civilizations have destroyed (only) themselves, and thus increases the<br>
chance that life is meaningful.<br>
<p>
Practical conclusion:  If it all turns out to be meaningless, we can<br>
commit suicide at leisure - but won't you feel stupid if it turns out<br>
that you shouldn't have slit your wrists?<br>
To sign up for cryonics, you don't need to know how the corpsicles will<br>
be revived, or believe that they will be, just that there's even a 10%<br>
chance of it working.<br>
<p>
And to those who say:<br>
"Summa nulla est,"<br>
I say:<br>
"Fac ut vivas."<br>
