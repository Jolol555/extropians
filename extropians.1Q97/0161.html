 If they do, then they should publish those statistics in a peer-reviewed <br>
 journal, search for explanations for why they work, test them under <br>
 varying conditions, and otherwise behave like scientists so that they <br>
 can /show/ us that they work, not just /tell/ us.  Authority by itself <br>
 is utterly meaningless.  Authorities in science g &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
The data generated by my clients is FDA reviewable for CGMP validation<br>
purposes.   Few of my clients would spend the time or money to publish and<br>
peer review because then their competition would use my client's research to<br>
sell their own products.  <br>
<p>
Also, many things accepted in science have not had mechanisms defined yet,<br>
 such as how preservatives act on the microbial cell.  We really don't know<br>
how they work very well, just that they seen to preserve the product without<br>
unacceptable harm to most humans. <br>
 <br>
The few that have mechanisms were university research projects sponsored by<br>
the government NIH or manufacturers.  It is true the FDA will at least _ask_<br>
what the mechanism is before approving most drugs during the NDA process.<br>
 They don't always get an answer. <br>
