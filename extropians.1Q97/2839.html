From: GBurch1@aol.com<br>
<i>&gt; As I'm sure most of you have already realized, this technology suggests a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "quick and dirty" approach to transcending the "natural" human lifespan.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Assuming that the technology for repairing broken neural pathways continues</i><br>
<i>&gt; to develop as quickly as it has seemed to in the last couple of years, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; appears that cloning up a replacement body and transplanting the brain is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pathway that is almost within reach.</i><br>
<p>
This is a very interesting idea, but I think it's going to take a lot more<br>
research before it becomes possible to hook up the neural connections<br>
between the brain and the new body.  There may not even be a one to one<br>
mapping possible, especially if the new body has been quiescent, without<br>
any active brain control.  The innervation patterns between the brain and<br>
the muscles and sense organs is presumably at least partially dependent<br>
on a lifetime of usage patterns.  The clone won't have the same brain/body<br>
interface as the person.<br>
<p>
This is a different problem than repairing broken neural pathways,<br>
because in that case you know that there is a mapping that works, you<br>
just have to induce the nerves to re-grow.  Even in that case I doubt<br>
that a complex neural network, like the spinal cord, could be expected<br>
to regrow spontaneously with correct connections.<br>
<p>
I am afraid that at best you are looking at years of physical therapy<br>
to learn to use the new body, and since the brain is not as plastic<br>
as an adult as it is when you are young, you will probably never have<br>
completely reliable control or sensation.<br>
<p>
And how about the brain cells?  Don't they age, with toxic byproducts<br>
building up, DNA damage, etc.?  I don't have the impression that brain<br>
tissue is particularly immortal.  If not, then even if transplanting<br>
worked it may not help much for extending maximum life span because the<br>
brain will die in a few years anyway.<br>
