I think every gene or meme has an automatic goal of "replication", and every<br>
individual has an automatic goal of "survival".  Failing those goals means<br>
failing all goals, as the actor isn't around to accomplish them.  Obviously<br>
people can and do adopt goals contrary to those fundamental goals.  Indeed,<br>
your genes, memes, and you aren't all in cahoots on particular issues, and<br>
under such circumstances one of the actors has to get stuffed.  But if you<br>
choose a goal which leads to your death, you (the individual) have obviously<br>
made a mistake, although some of your genes or memes might actually score big<br>
by your death.<br>
<p>
Like you, I'd be disturbed if there were some God which wanted to stuff goals<br>
down my throat.  I have never understood why Existentialism, which holds that<br>
there is no inherent meaning to the universe, and that we have to create our<br>
own meanings, is considered "depressing".  To me, the alternative is<br>
depressing.<br>
