: &gt; [...] : no group of people is a "point mass"; they all have<br>
: &gt;internal forces.  I'd think of corporations as more like fleets of ships,<br>
: &gt;of various sizes ...<br>
:<br>
: Neither is a star a point mass; it too has internal forces.  The analogy can<br>
: be maitained, could it be that you just didn't like where it was going?<br>
<p>
The internal forces of a star don't affect the symmetry of its gravity field.<br>
Those of a cluster, on another hand, occasionally eject a member star.<br>
