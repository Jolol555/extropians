Yes, I too am very glad that great religious scientists have, for whatever  <br>
reasons,  chosen to devote at least some of their time to Science, I'm just  <br>
saying I don't understand it, if I was  religious I could think of better <br>
things to do than study Science. Actually, I don't think my view would be <br>
completely incomprehensible to religious people, take Isaac Newton for <br>
example. <br>
<p>
Newton was a very religious man, Newton was a very obnoxious man, Newton was <br>
an arrogant bastard, Newton was the greatest genus that the Human Race has <br>
yet produced. Tragically this colossal intellect was horribly infected with <br>
the religious meme. This meme hijacked most of his massive mental machinery <br>
and forced it to think and write far, far more about religion than about <br>
Science. Today even Theologians admit that the many millions of words that <br>
Newton wrote about The Bible are worthless. Newton advanced Science more than <br>
any other Human Being, but I think it's one of the great tragedies of History <br>
that the rarest, most valuable quality that existed in the world was not used <br>
to full advantage. Think what Newton could have accomplished if his mind had <br>
not been caught in a infinite loop, and I blame religion for that.<br>
     <br>
