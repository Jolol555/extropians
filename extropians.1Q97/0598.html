<p>
Broad spectrum passive sensors.  Similar in concept to traditional IR<br>
sensing equipment, but with much extended capabilities, both in sensitivity<br>
and in spectral range.  A lot of new and advanced materials are used in the<br>
design by requirement.  <br>
<p>
Additionally, the signal processing has been improved dramatically.  Of<br>
primary significance is the discovery of two new processing<br>
techniques/algorithms that provide vast improvements over previous<br>
techniques, as well as discrimination capabilities not found in the<br>
traditional algorithms.  The new algorithms are classified/proprietary and<br>
therefore unavailable for discussion :-(<br>
That's okay though.  I never really understood them since it wasn't part of<br>
my job, so I couldn't explain them anyway.<br>
<p>
In one implementation, the sensor data is fed through a multi-processor<br>
MIPS-based computer which processes the data using five different<br>
algorithms, including the two classified ones mentioned above.  The<br>
resulting datasets are re-integrated using another algorithm to produce the<br>
final picture.  The results are very impressive.<br>

I was kind of surprised myself.  It took me about two hours of research to<br>
write that part of the post.  Nonetheless, you would still get more bang for<br>
the buck using nuclear weapons in the lunar environment.  For the same<br>
incapacitating reasons, conventional explosives would have limited<br>
destructive capability as well.  An atmosphere is immensely useful for<br>
transmitting hydrostatic shock and transporting heat energy.  But as long as<br>
the lunar settlement was not spread too widely across the moon, nuclear<br>
weapons would still be pretty effective.<br>
