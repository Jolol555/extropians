It is not true that they hold this beleif. Libertarians beleive in<br>
equality of opportunity, NOT equality of result. Libertarians beleive in<br>
economic forces unleashed to allow natural selection to proceed<br>
unimpeded to improve the human condition. THis is why libertarians tend<br>
to be highly intelligent, educated, and average high incomes, as they<br>
practice what they preach. THis unfortunately limits the growth of the<br>
party, as the principles of libertarianism tend to disfavor those with<br>
deficiencies which inhibit economic excellence.<br>
<p>
I personally tend to think that children should be raised in equal<br>
social circumstances, to allow as close to an equal level of opportunity<br>
as possible, but once they reach whatever is considered "adulthood",<br>
they live by TANSTAAFL.<br>
<p>
As libertarian as I tend to be, I still have had enough personal<br>
experience with people I call "trust fund babies" to consider huge<br>
inheritances as a net evolutionary disadvantage.<br>

<p>
This is a decent idea so long as you don't propose taking wealth away<br>
from people. Making everyone start at zero once they reach adulthood is<br>
what I would call equality of opportunity, but redistributing the wealth<br>
isn't, its penalizing success.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Distributing the wealth evenly is not needed and will do a lot of damage</i><br>
<i>&gt; early on, it could take years before the economy restores from such a blow,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and many people will lose their confidence in the system, as who is to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a redistribution is not scheduled again, and again ?, and what then</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be the motivation to be succesful ?. IMO a good system of social</i><br>
