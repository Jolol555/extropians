[Saith Lee Daniel Crocker:]<br>
<i>&gt; Call me a button-pusher if you will; I hold the title proudly.  Consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; me the QA department for the mind.  There's a bug here: if you push this</i><br>
<i>&gt; button, it malfunctions.  Your response is "well, don't push that button".</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mine is let's /remove/ the button.  Let's fix the bug.  Maybe I've spent</i><br>
<i>&gt; too much time in software QA, but sometimes you have to deliberately</i><br>
<i>&gt; push those buttons and look for failures to get things fixed.</i><br>
<p>
I also like the idea of redesigning the human mind to never take offense<br>
at anything.  Now, I am NOT about to say:  "But we have to live in this<br>
world for now."  What I AM going to say is that the human mind is also<br>
designed to *give* offense, not just to take it.  Deliberately giving<br>
offense calls your motives into question; they will almost certainly be<br>
partially emotional.  Maybe "deliberately" isn't really the word I'd<br>
like to use.  Acting in such manner as to give offense?  Being angry<br>
enough not to pull your verbal punches?  Starting to demonize your<br>
opponent?<br>
<p>
"Demonizing" your opponent, assigning numerous evil habits to him - be<br>
those evil habits drinking the blood of innocent children or supporting<br>
classical AI - is almost certainly not an aid to rational thought, nor<br>
to winning arguments, for the simple reason that your opponent is most<br>
likely<br>
*innocent* and if the debate is being conducted on any sort of rational<br>
grounds, you'll wind up with egg all over your face.  But if you're<br>
trying to raise a mob, demonization is indeed a successful strategy. <br>
Therefore, being offensive in certain ways is indeed a sign of<br>
irrationality and should not be blamed on those who take offense.<br>
<p>
Then there's being angry enough to stop weasel-wording and say what you<br>
REALLY think.  I live for the day I can do this on a routine basis,<br>
speak the complete truth reflexively and without anxiety intervening. <br>
So I don't see any problem with stripping away, in the heat of the<br>
moment, a few unnecessary qualifiers, some jargon, and the legalese.<br>
<p>
And then there's demonization on the part of the audience, or people who<br>
have been persecuted by certain ideas to the point where they develop<br>
"trigger" phrases that cause them to stop listening or shoot the<br>
speaker; if anybody tries to tell me that I'm "intellectualizing", my<br>
innate reaction is to kill them, without anger, in self-defense...<br>
because I have learned to associate this statement with a personal and<br>
physical threat.  Those who have learned to associate "evolutionism"<br>
with a threat to their religious beliefs... or to put it another way,<br>
everything they love... may react similarly if you mention "Darwin". <br>
And this reaction, I think, is simply there and not inherently rational<br>
or irrational; sometimes arguments *are* used as weapons and one may<br>
need to respond in kind.<br>
