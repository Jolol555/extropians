ever-growing, and ever-dying.  That needn't be the case.  Uploading<br>
yourself could put a halt to this process, if your "self-image" is never<br>
activated.  You could exist on file for centuries.  As immortality goes,<br>
that's not much to look forward to, but I rankle at the<br>
suggestion that immortality is IMPOSSIBLE...  Even in the  philosophical<br>
sense, it is POSSIBLE, if undesirable.<br>

You know I see the quasi attractiveness of uploading your memories and<br>
stuff on line, but I fail to see how that would emcompass the entire aspect<br>
of what you really are.  I'm not sure that it would be "me" existing on<br>
files for centures!  seems like the emotional perspective is left out, as<br>
well as the intuitive.  Ostensibly, in email I'm uploading parts of my mind<br>
right now, but considering i'm having thoughts on various different levels<br>
all at the same time, this idea of a micro robot collecting data, except<br>
perhaps at the very instance of death to upload, to me seems very, very<br>
strange.  how can it possibly include the complexities of emotions we feel<br>
(and how would it be able to interpret that? --- and if it did this at the<br>
moment of death, then what emotional state would you be in that would be<br>
uploaded, is this what you want recorded in files forever?), as well as the<br>
data running around in our brains?  How does it account for the subthoughts<br>
underneath the "forethoughts" of our brain, which might indeed be<br>
influencing the "forethoughts" in subtle ways we don't even realize...and<br>
the "robot" would have to be able to get all of these at once to really<br>
replicate the complex beings we are.  How would it be able to do this when<br>
we ourselves are not always sure of that is going on in our subconscious?<br>
Since we ourselves, as beings, are not completely cognizant of the<br>
complexities that influence why we think the way we do, why do some think<br>
we could create a "robot" to be able to do it?  (after all, we created it<br>
from a place of lacking full information).  For us to assume that we fully<br>
understand how each individual thinks, and the full process of our brains,<br>
(which is also problematic in that we don't fully understand the process of<br>
that which we understand as whatever we consider "self" to be being related<br>
to other aspects of the body, like the heart, and cell-to-cell<br>
communication so we might leave out crucial elements if we think that this<br>
"being" that we are is totally and completely defined by the brain) which I<br>
think at this point, we have only begun to understand.  <br>
<p>
I guess I'm not so sure that we can upload our beings to a computer...I<br>
think we are far too complex at this point.  I don't know how we could<br>
possibly upload the "wetware" of our brain to replicate the real synapsis<br>
that is going on.  So far i've not heard of technology that can reproduce<br>
the brain cells, etc.  The only thing I've heard of which might POSSIBLE<br>
work....is the new DNA based chips...which are experimental at this time.<br>
And even were you able to upload everything to this kind of a machine with<br>
your own DNA as part of the chip, and then upload all the data of your<br>
brain onto a *multi* gig harddrive if not more....you can still get fried<br>
in an electrical storm.  Anyhow, I like the flesh!  :)  It's warm, and it's<br>
me.  I don't think you can upload *that*.<br>
<p>
then again, I'm an unabashed hedonist....<br>
