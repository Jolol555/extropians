1) Last night I was thinking about Eliezer's scenario:<br>
<p>
(Moore's Law) Computing power doubles every two years.<br>
(Eliezer's refinement) Computing power doubles every two subjective years.<br>
<p>
So once computers reach human equivalence, doubling time will reduce<br>
to one year, then to half a year, and so on, which would lead to<br>
infinite power in four years if there were not some ceiling to <br>
computing speed.<br>
<p>
I asked myself how much *subjective* time would elapse between <br>
human-equivalence and maximum speed. If there was no ceiling to<br>
speed, then elapsed time would be infinite, but in practice it's going <br>
to reach some apex (e.g. a millionfold increase).<br>
<p>
Suppose we call human processing speed 1 h ("h" for "human"), maximum <br>
processing speed K h, the doubling time in Moore's Law M.  By Eliezer's <br>
criterion, subjective time to maximum speed would be M log_2(K). <br>
For K = 1 million (~= 2^20), M = 2 years, this is about forty subjective<br>
years (s-years). For twenty doublings, elapsed real-time would be<br>
1 + 1/2 + .. + 1/(2^19) yrs = 2 - 1/(2^19) yrs, or about a minute short<br>
of two r-years (real years!).<br>
<p>
(Incidentally, the way NOT to do this problem is to say (as I did), <br>
"Between human equivalence and maximum speed, speed is a hyperbolic <br>
function of time, so let's integrate a hyperbolic function." The integral<br>
of Sqrt[x^2-a^2] is a mess, as <a href="http://www.integrals.com">http://www.integrals.com</a> can tell you.)<br>
<p>
2) The upper bound on this process would be determined by the limits<br>
of what one can do with atomic matter, which is what we have to hand.<br>
(That millionfold increase is Drexler's guesstimate of the upper bound.) <br>
Perhaps you can go faster using (e.g.) neutronium, but I have no idea how <br>
long it would be before we could actually obtain some (how far to the <br>
nearest neutron star? how long would it take to get there in s-time?).<br>
<p>
Once you start manipulating very dense objects, though, there may be<br>
the possibility of using baby universes. If you can spawn a new universe <br>
but retain a traversible wormhole connection to the parent universe, you <br>
can probably create an exponentially proliferating network of universes.<br>
<p>
How quickly? The first stars formed about 1 billion years pbb (post Big <br>
Bang); according to the recent discussion here on the far future, the <br>
last stars will be dying out at about 100 trillion years pbb. So if<br>
we assume that it's 10^9 years before you can start spawning again from<br>
inside a new universe, the useful lifetime of a single universe will be<br>
about 10^14 years = 10^5 "generations", certainly long enough to<br>
achieve exponential growth. (If we assume, arbitrarily and perhaps<br>
conservatively, that each universe can spawn a billion others, then<br>
after n generations (n billion years) there will be (10^9n) universes<br>
in our network. The "retirement" of earlier generations makes a<br>
negligible difference to the population increase.)<br>
<p>
If we fill all those universes with processors and turn the whole<br>
network into a single big computer, it looks as though we can have <br>
exponentially increasing computer power forever. For the arbitrary<br>
case above, doubling time would be about 30 million years.<br>
<p>
But in fact there would be a slowdown, since as the network grows, <br>
the time it takes to send a signal from one side of the network to <br>
the other will increase. Here's why:<br>
<p>
Presumably there is a lower limit to the size of a stable wormhole.<br>
In a universe like ours, the volume of space increases at best<br>
polynomially with time, so we can only have a polynomial increase in <br>
the number of wormholes per universe (and thus only a polynomial increase <br>
in the number of universes to which a single universe is directly connected).<br>
<p>
But at maximal proliferation rate, the number of universes increases<br>
exponentially.  So the longest network path increases exponentially, <br>
and we have an exponential *slowdown* of entities distributed<br>
across the network.<br>
<p>
Despite this, it seems logical to me that the final form for a <br>
self-evolving entity which makes it to the stage of intelligent <br>
superobject is an endlessly proliferating network of universe-brains, <br>
connected to avatars in spacetime regions throughout a broader <br>
"multiverse". This would be the final form since it's one which allows <br>
for immortality and unlimited further development without further<br>
upgrades in the basic platform (by which I mean changes like the move <br>
from carbon to silicon, or from atoms to neutronium).<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the reason this scenario isn't as well known as the<br>
Dyson and Tipler scenarios (I call it the Linde scenario, after<br>
Andrei Linde, the cosmologist who developed the idea of the<br>
self-reproducing universe) is that it lacks mathematical rigor.<br>
We have (speculative!) mathematical descriptions of the spawning of <br>
baby universes, and of traversible wormholes, but as far as I know<br>
no one has a model for how a baby universe might remain traversibly<br>
connected to its parent. The closest thing I've seen is a remark by<br>
Hawking, that there are particle trajectories which can pass from<br>
our universe into baby universes (but they proceed along imaginary<br>
time, whatever that turns out to mean ontologically). So perhaps<br>
you make a wormhole first, and then send one end on such a trajectory.<br>
<p>
3) Michael Nielsen (mnielsen@tangelo.phys.unm.edu) has figured out<br>
something he calls the quantum Moore's Law, describing our ability to <br>
simulate quantum computers. Basically, we can manage one more qubit <br>
every two years. I presume that this is because adding one qubit to a <br>
quantum computer doubles the number of its basis states. (The current<br>
apex of quantum-computer simulation: a 21-qubit computer was simulated <br>
somewhere in South America, and successfully factored 15 using Shor's <br>
algorithm.)<br>
<p>
I have no idea what the rate of increase in processor power<br>
would be once you start making *real* quantum computers, as opposed<br>
to simulating them.<br>
