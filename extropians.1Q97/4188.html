Dear Webmaster,<br>
<p>
I am writing on behalf of Discovery Communications, Inc., parent company<br>
of Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel. In the summer of 1995,<br>
Discovery launched Discovery Channel Online, a World Wide Web site that<br>
extends the real world entertainment of its cable programming to<br>
cyberspace.<br>
<p>
We actively seek links to high-quality sites like yours that feature<br>
content related to subjects on our site. We would like to link to your<br>
site through History Connections--related to James Burke's program<br>
"Connections." As part of History Connections, we have created a contest<br>
called "Webweaving" in which we provide clues for users to make the<br>
"connection." <br>
<p>
Your page contains material relevant to the connection, and we plan to<br>
link to your site throughout April. The contest will then be archived<br>
for a year.<br>
<p>
The page we are linking to is located at:<br>
<a href="http://www.unicorn.com//lib/law.html">http://www.unicorn.com//lib/law.html</a><br>
<p>
There is the potential for hundreds of users to attempt to access your<br>
site through these links. Please let us know at your soonest convenience<br>
whether this extra traffic will present any technical problems for your<br>
server.<br>
<p>
If we do not hear from you, we will continue to point Discovery users to<br>
your site.<br>
<p>
Also, should the URL for this page change, would you please contact Jude<br>
Doherty at jdoherty@discovery.com?<br>
<p>
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. We look<br>
forward to hearing from you.<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
Elizabeth Cleary<br>
Discovery Channel Online Consultant<br>
