From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt;<br>
<p>
10Mt (nuclear)  =  900kton (mass @ 11000 m/s)  = ~60m diameter ferrous rock<br>
<p>
Impact parameters, assuming 10Mt (energy, nuclear equivalence) impacts on earth:<br>
<p>
CRATER DEPTH:           Nuclear: 60 meters      Rock:   250 meters<br>
CRATER DIAMETER:        Nuclear: 2000 meters    Rock:   1500 meters<br>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE:  According to sources, a rock must have a mass &gt;500 tons in<br>
order to impact at the above assumed velocity.  Rocks with less than 500<br>
tons mass are slowed by atmospheric drag to velocities less than 1000 m/s.<br>
A one ton rock will not work.<br>
<p>
From: Michael Lorrey:<br>
<p>
No he showed a massive difference in ground penetration with the<br>
advantage to rocks. He also compared what would be needed for<br>
equivalence in damage on earth for a 10MT nuke and a rock. I am<br>
proposing using smaller rocks, preformed as conic atmospheric<br>
=====<br>
Penetration isn't too relevant, as few Earth structures are underground<br>
anyway.  Terrestrial military might be in trouble, but this thread<br>
originally started as a MAD scenario.<br>
<p>
I don't know my drag.  Would conic rocks surive?  Warheads do, but do<br>
they have special surfaces?  And the shaping won't help the fact that 1<br>
ton rocks don't have much energy; James got megaton equivalence using<br>
very BIG rocks.  Rocks big enough for Earth to use active defense<br>
against -- to detect and break up into badly shaped fragments that burn<br>
up in atmosphere or at least slow down.<br>
