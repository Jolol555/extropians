Erik Moeller explains:<br>
	I'd like a high income, too. High enough to allow me to pay my<br>
	phone bills, finance my computer activities, realize myself.<br>
	But is it still self-interest to accumulate millions or even<br>
	billions? Is it need?<br>
<p>
We've all got projects to finance.<br>
<p>
	If this wealth was shared, nobody would have to starve. There would<br>
	be no poverty. Everything would be great, fantastic, perfect.<br>
	The problem you ignore is accumulation.<br>
<p>
Fascinating.  Tell me how a confiscatory tax on savings would improve<br>
the distribution of food.<br>
<p>
And how sheep's bladders may be used to prevent earthquakes.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; If I'm the boss and the state works for me then I should be able to</i><br>
<i>	&gt; fire the state whenever I want to. Unfortunately I can not, because</i><br>
<i>	&gt; I am not the boss and the state won't let me quit.</i><br>
<p>
	Not you are the boss. The population of the country is the boss.<br>
	If everyone decides that they don't want the state anymore, the<br>
	state can be "fired".<br>
<p>
Since the state's officers are part of the population of the country,<br>
the state will never be fired under such a rule.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; [JKC describes the market]</i><br>
<p>
	Which essentially means: If the decisions the customers make are<br>
	right, the right people will have the power (although monopolies<br>
	will form)<br>
<p>
(false)<br>
<p>
	and the right products will be produced. The problem is that the<br>
	customers' decisions are usually not for the best product available<br>
	but for the product most advertised.<br>
<p>
Whereas voters and politicians, since they have no reason to care about<br>
the results of their decisions, are far more enlightened.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
	Look at Japan. Much state influence. Great country.<br>
<p>
High cost of living, tiny apartments, social regimentation, high rate of<br>
"suicide" (including family massacres) ...<br>
<p>
	Imagine Japan had started with free markets after WW II,<br>
	they'd be like South Korea today.<br>
<p>
Oh, so it was free markets that caused a hostile neighbor to appear?<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
	I have nothing against rich people who spend their money in big cars<br>
	or houses etc., the money stays in movement. But it is "evil" (to<br>
	use [JKC's] words) if companies and banks invest money in the stock<br>
	market where it just circulates. This is where the big money<br>
	acucmulates. To nearly no one's benefit. The money invested in stock<br>
	markets gets to (large) companies again. But these large companies<br>
	tend to re-invest the money in stock markets instead of making<br>
	investments in their company, for the stock market promises a higher<br>
	profit! So the money available decreases, few people get richer and<br>
	richer but without *using* the money -- only to get richer. And the<br>
	amount of CIRCULATING money decreases.<br>
<p>
If the money supply decreases, prices fall.  Big deal.<br>
<p>
	No one has an interest in making superior products in free markets<br>
	except for moral reasons, for<br>
	- investments in stock markets promise the highest profit to large<br>
	  companies<br>
<p>
If stock speculation is the best way to profit, I wonder why anybody<br>
ever bothered making anything.  Why did anybody ever build a railroad<br>
or a factory, instead of just playing the stock market?<br>
<p>
	- simply killing other companies with force is much cheaper,<br>
	 and if you control the media, no one will learn about it<br>
<p>
Thank god that politicians, and not industrialists or bankers, control<br>
the police, the army and the media.<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
	There are no realizable alternatives [to capitalism], so the only<br>
	way to make it is to make the pyramid as big as possible in order<br>
	to reach transcension before the collapse. But if the market is<br>
	liberated, the collapse will come faster, [...]<br>
<p>
The USSR's economy collapsed first because it was too free?<br>
