Hmm, how very odd.  I just got a comment from someone who was delighted<br>
that my email was word wrapping when everyone elses was giving him problems<br>
and that is what I have it set to in my Eudora Pro 3.0, which is the latest<br>
version.  What kind of email program are *you* using?<br>
Ah, I see....Pine...&lt;whince&gt;....no wonder.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
really?  I probably know them!  tell me in private who they were if you<br>
don't mind...your name, btw, looks vaguely familiar to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I can't understand the complete and utter rejection of such</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;*Is* there a complete rejection of such things? I'm rather fond of that</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
Well I guess I believe that it is both actually.  Because I have such<br>
*strange* synchronistic and unusual things happening in my life on a<br>
regular basis, because I have done pretty intense ritual with some really<br>
amazing and experienced ritualists, because I've seen somethings that just<br>
can't be explained as merely my "internal" filters on reality, and which<br>
many of those on this list probably wouldn't believe, so I won't talk about<br>
them, I think that there is much more to it than just an internal<br>
experience.  THis is not to say that my brain isn't experiencing it at the<br>
same time, however.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact, AFAIR the reading list used to include 'Prometheus Rising' by</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robert Anton Wilson. The fifth of the eight brain circuits in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Leary/Wilson model was primarily concerned with such states. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Well I agree, that the brain is experiencing the ecstatic, (though I<br>
experience it more than with just my brain, thank you very much), but this<br>
doesn't mean that it's not connected to something outside of it.  Leary,<br>
btw, also believed that there was more to our consciousness after we left<br>
as well.  I think that the universe and we are much more complex than<br>
that....no man is an island unto himself and all that.  One of the greatest<br>
damage that Monotheistic/Abrahamic trads has done on the Psyche is this<br>
idea that somehow we are separate from the Creator/Divine.  I don't see it<br>
that way. I don't believe we are merely fleshy machines that can be reduced<br>
down solely to the data in our brains (especially with the new information<br>
that is being learned about the heart and it's imortance, other than just<br>
being a "pump" new research is showing that it has it's own form of<br>
"intelligence" as well and is vitally connected to the braina and how the<br>
brain reacts to certain things. (<a href="http://www.heartmath.com">http://www.heartmath.com</a>)  And there is<br>
more and more evidence of a cellular type intelligence as well.  And on the<br>
subject of the brain, once we've described it down to the various chemical<br>
and physical processes, etc, that's all fine and dandy, but people like<br>
Crick are missing an essential, at least to me, point.  Just *what* is it<br>
that is having the experiences of all the processes?  Something is<br>
experiencing that, right?<br>
<p>
Of course I could be completely wrong too...but intuitively this makes more<br>
sense to me.<br>
<p>
Peace!<br>
