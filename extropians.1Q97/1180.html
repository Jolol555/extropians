I enjoyed your post on Camille Claudel, may I please ask a followup <br>
question:<br>
QueenMuse:<br>
<i>&gt;This is not to imply that it was Rodin who was responsible, nor men, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;continued victim status that women choose to accept. IMHO.</i><br>
<p>
This statement seems to contradict the rest of your post, and it may <br>
be because you chose the word 'status'.  If Camille <br>
worked relentlessly on her art, and the art world refused to accept <br>
it;  and then her husband stole her techniques and he was lionized by <br>
the art world, what in the world could she have done to change her <br>
'victim' status?  I assume that if she had left her husband she would have <br>
been ostracized by all of her support structures in her family and <br>
community in addition to being ignored by the art world.  Under a <br>
basic analysis, she possesses a victim 'status', although I wouldn't <br>
necessarily use that word.<br>
<p>
However, if we focus on mentality, the entire picture changes.  <br>
Camille clearly did not accept her lot in life, continued to work for <br>
her art against all odds, and refused to give into a victim <br>
'mentality'.  Could that be what you mean?  I wish that it had <br>
changed her life more, tho. <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
