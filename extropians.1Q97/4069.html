<i>&gt;&gt; The group members apparently committed suicide in the belief a UFO,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; shielded behind a comet, would take them to heaven.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;THis really ticks me off. They ought to press murder or some other</i><br>
<i>&gt;charges against Shramek, the amateur astronomer who claimed that he</i><br>
<i>&gt;spotted a huge "saturn-like" ufo behind Hale-Bopp several months ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's his scientific fraud that perpetrated all this crap. The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;he was shown to be wrong but refused to acknowledge the truth publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a damn crime. THis is one example of all the people he's hoodwinked</i><br>
<i>&gt;with his BS.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- </i><br>

I've never heard of Shramek, nor do I care about astrology.  I don't even<br>
see how you can call it a "scientific fraud."  It's just plain crap,<br>
undifferentiated from what you can see and hear constantly on talk TV, or<br>
talk radio, or dozens of pseudo-science programs.   It's entertainment, or<br>
what passes for it, these days.  Still, that doesn't make Shramek guilty of<br>
murder.  Certainly, we must have a higher standard than that.  We can't even<br>
convict OJ Simpson!<br>
