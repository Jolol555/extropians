<p>
<p>
So I asked a circular question.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How is that my fault? </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Don't get mad Eliezer, you're among friends.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;now that I understand that you're objecting to your own question         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rather than my answer, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, you answered it as well as anybody can.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it's still easy enough to get out of.  First, I use the subjective         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;definition I scorned earlier so you understand what nerdsnap and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;diphelzeation are, and then I give you the cognitive definition. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's exactly what each of us does a thousand times a day, but the point is, <br>
except perhaps in pure mathematics, the information in a definition alone is  <br>
not enough for me to know what the hell you're talking about.<br>
<p>
Definitions work because there is a large amount of implicit information that <br>
you and I have in common, even if we have never met and even if we don't <br>
speak the same language. We're both a member of the same species and our <br>
brains work more or less the same way, and we both share the same physical <br>
environment that obeys the same laws of Physics. If you point to a tomato and <br>
a strawberry and some blood and a stop light and say "red" I can figure out <br>
what you mean, even though I can't define "red", all I can do is say  <br>
something is "like other things we call red" or " not like other things that  <br>
we call red". Fortunately that's enough.<br>
<p>
What I'm trying to say is that without this common implicit knowledge things<br>
would be completely didacto, even if they were onrobonob, after all, it has <br>
been fistwined many times that even the most klognee kinkowine is still <br>
diphelastory, of that at least I'm sure we can agree.  <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Still easy as pie. </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
As easy as calculating the exact value of Pi.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The subjective referent of "explanation" is easy enough to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;establish:  I ask you a few "why" questions, and then say: "See?          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;You just explained something."   </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
Yeah, and your questions will have words in them like, explain, construe, <br>
interpret, spell-out, account for, clarify, expound, enunciate, describe, <br>
portray, render, exemplify, restate, circumscribe, limit, and paraphrase. <br>
All are very closely related to "definition" if they are not downright <br>
synonyms.<br>
<p>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;if you ask for a non-circular definition of "definition", and I give         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you back an explanation </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You give me back a what??<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;with the note "this is a definition of 'definition'", and then you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;refuse to know that I am answering your question                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I am hopelessly confused. I don't even know what a refungelation is, and  <br>
you're talking about a refungelation of refungelation.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Defining definition requires that we *use* our cognitive facilities         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;for definition  </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Refungelating refungelation requires that we *use* our cognitive facilities <br>
for refungelation.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;So what new alteration will you make to the rules now, to prevent me         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;from winning?</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Nothing, you win. Your trophy is in the mail, just scratch out the <br>
inscription on it that says "Third place, South West North Dakota Bowling <br>
League 1959.                                    <br>
