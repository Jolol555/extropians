A Hiroshima weapon was only used twice and look at the shock it induced.<br>
The only environmental damages from those were from radiation. Dust<br>
fallout nature treats as fertilizer. Look at the Mt St. Helens fallout<br>
pattern: Washington and Oregon farmers now have bumper crops of the best<br>
apples, cherrys and wines in the country (sorry CA). A one ton ferrous<br>
rock = 10 ktons of TNT = one Hiroshima weapon w/out radiation = farmers<br>
paradise. <br>
<p>
One hundred such rocks impacting would wreck the terran economy,<br>
military and space capability, but probably have a maximum kill of no<br>
more than 1 million people, much less especially if a lunar GOvt is<br>
humane and advises ahead of time all target locations so people can<br>
evacuate impact zones. Such an act would go farther propaganda wise to<br>
alienate people from supporting a repressive terran government policy.<br>

Check the citations in the book COSMOS. I'm sure you can find a copy at<br>

<p>

<i>&gt; } Mars would within 100-200 years become more powerfull than Earth and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; } Moon, as it is higher still, terraformable( i.e. high population</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lower in energy; useful or quick terraforming is hardly guaranteed, Kim</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robinson notwithstanding.  Earth has a fair chance of remaining the</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual capital.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Robin claims we're debating a vague question, since there's no</i><br>
<i>&gt; specification of lunar colony size or exact political conditions.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought we were swimming through multiple possibilities at once, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps not very well.</i><br>
<p>
Early independence of the moon would be uncontestable by earth powers,<br>
so long as you have one rogue nation with a 10,000 foot runway and<br>
plenty of international airspace all around. I personally like the way<br>
the Seychelles Government is shaping up as a  haven of diplomatic<br>
immunity, and its on the equator too!! Plenty of money flowing in to<br>
fund development, and a great R&amp;R spot. If He3 becomes a big commodity,<br>
they would love to be Luna's Earthside banking center.<br>
<p>
As I see it, while conditions may change, no terran government is fast<br>
enough to mobilize and develop fast enough to outwit or outmaneuver a<br>
LunaCorp seeking independence. There is too much inertia toward an<br>
entropic end to large terran governments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } Jupiter and Saturn: if you stellate them via Von Neumann machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought the last argument on this decided that the Jovians could not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be stars.</i><br>
<p>
By thermoneuclear explosions, yes it would be impossible, but the Clarke<br>
scenario (al la 2010) of using Von Neumann machines with fusion<br>
synthesis capability to raise the actual density of Jupiter to the point<br>
that it implodes to begin stellation for a short period (10,000-1<br>
million years) is theoretically possible.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } Venus is impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm arguing with someone who claims he can convert angular and linear</i><br>
<i>&gt; momentum and who has just proposed stellating the large Jovians, on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; list with regular discussions of Tipler cylinders, infinite Omega Points</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a Singularity in 38 years, or 28 years, or maybe before the</i><br>
<i>&gt; millenium.  And I've just been told that colonizing Venus is impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Catch this, Anders?  Extro-conservative high point...</i><br>
<p>
Ha. The thing about Venus is that it has gone on baking for so long that<br>
revesing the process would be a HUGE undertaking, and go completely<br>
outside the bounds of normal planetary evolution. Mars is not so<br>
difficult, and would only take about 20-30 years to achieve a .5-1.0 bar<br>
CO2-CFC atmosphere, and 100 to make a .75-.90 bar oxy-CO2-CFC atmosphere<br>
with a 1000 km^2 ocean, and a 50 deg F eQuatorial average atmospheric<br>
temp.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why?  High atmospheric pressure yes, but I hadn't heard it defied known</i><br>
<i>&gt; forces, or even materials -- Russian probes lasted there, just not for</i><br>
<i>&gt; very long.  It's very hot, but that's what air conditioning was made</i><br>
<i>&gt; for.  Admittedly the problem is more interesting, in that you might have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to cool the very surface of the material, or else (more likely?) have</i><br>
<i>&gt; some way to continually renew it, but at the moment these seem like</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly interesting engineering problems.  (I'm also not sure about</i><br>
<i>&gt; dumping the heat from the fusion or black hole reactor; can air</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditioning go that far?  If not, perhaps deep drill for geothermal.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I presume much would be underground as usual, or under whatever the</i><br>
<i>&gt; surface is like.</i><br>
<p>
Its hard to cool when there is nothing cool. Building habitable<br>
environments on Venus surface is in the order of building walkin<br>
refrigerators capable of 1 deg K, with a huge bar pressure differential.<br>
While I shouldn't have said "impossible", economically impossible would<br>
be more appropriate. What would be a big help would be to use HUGE<br>
Lorrey Drives to move Mars into orbit around Venus (he he). The tides<br>
would rip so much atmosphere off Venus that it may be possible. By<br>
inducing tidal drag on venus, we can despin the crust relative to the<br>
core a bit, so Venus will generate a magnetic field and EM radiation<br>
belts, thus reducing the amount of solar flux hitting the planet. Hell,<br>
then use HUGE Lorrey Drives to move Venus out to the Terra/Sol L3<br>
Lagrange point, opposite from Earth. COOOOOOLLLLLLLL.<br>
<p>
I like the idea better now, thanks.....<br>
