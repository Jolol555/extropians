I am almost persuaded that some questions ought not to be explored, because<br>
the very act of doing so can be corrupting in a given contingent ideological<br>
(memetic, if you like) setting.  Questions are all too easy easy to pose,<br>
and need not be sensible or even meaningful.  Is the moon made of green<br>
cheese?  Are unicorns made of green cheese?  Are Jews or Australians the<br>
scum of the earth and in need of extermination?  If you know that raising<br>
sarcastic questions about the sex life of the Prophet's entourage, even<br>
disguised as a dream, is likely to lead to people being killed without<br>
bringing about any benefit in insight among fundamentalists (as Rushdie<br>
surely did know or suspect), is it worth doing?  <br>
<p>
Or to take the matter of racism: several people on this list have explicitly<br>
or implictly raised the question whether the mean intelligence of black<br>
people is measurably lower than that of white people, and whether, if so,<br>
that is due to genetic causes.  Should such a question be left unasked, or<br>
is this secondary question itself evidence of a desire to crush out free<br>
thought?  <br>
<p>
It has been effectively argued that questions of black/white IQ are not<br>
well-formed, and that any answer is therefore misleading.  Yet the<br>
consequences of any answer, however intellectually worthless, can be<br>
injurious to whites and blacks alike, since people by and large are children<br>
of their ideological climate.  Why is the question raised in the first<br>
place?  Because their racist histories have led many whites to perceive<br>
black people as innately intellectually inferior.  Their sexist histories<br>
have led many males to see women as innately intellectually restricted.  A<br>
different history might have proposed the common suspicion that short<br>
redheads are smarter or more creative or morally nicer or sexier than blonds<br>
over the height of two metres.  Would *we* regard such a question as worthy<br>
of investigation?  No doubt a metric could be designed, tests calibrated,<br>
results organised by factor analysis...<br>
<p>
On the other hand, sexual dimorphism does look (to me, for what that's<br>
worth; not much) to be a more fundamental category than many other rather<br>
more historically contingent distinctions.  Research to hand suggests to me<br>
that extreme success in a number of fields of apparently abstract,<br>
non-sex-linked endeavour has indeed tended to be found preferentially in<br>
males rather than females.  Obviously this is likely to be a *statistical*<br>
fact, so that certain females might turn out to do at least as well as<br>
almost all males or even better, even if other females typically do worse.<br>
This *is* a question worth pursuing (as long as the social consequences are<br>
not absolutely repulsive and unavoidable).  The answers look likely to turn<br>
out to be along these lines:<br>
<p>
1)  Males generally have greater variation in their population statistics,<br>
so there is a greater proportion of duds in any task/skill/capacity than in<br>
female equivalent groups, and also a greater proportion of supremely<br>
effective performers.  If we learn what causes this variance spread, perhaps<br>
we can use that knowledge to shift both male and females curves to the<br>
right, or squeeze up the lefthand side of the bell.<br>
<p>
2)  Extreme performance seems to be correlated with a testosterone cascade<br>
in early natal development, of the kind usually associated with<br>
testes-formation in the embryo.  It might also be driven by male-typical<br>
testosterone titres in the mature organism.  If these suggestions are<br>
correct, it would be important to know those mechanisms, so we can tailor<br>
them closer to our heart's desire.<br>
