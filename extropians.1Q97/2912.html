And how would you accomplish this, by taking away children from their<br>
parents ? I think an equal chances education system (based on capacities,<br>
not finances) is the best way to guarantee an equal starting position. And<br>
yes, from there on i agree they're on their own... <br>
<p>
Human labor is the greatest resource we have on this planet. Educating that<br>
human resource is going to multiply its value enormously. Making sure the<br>
people with the capacity end up taking the right places in society, is<br>
instrumental to the success of a system. A complete laissez faire system<br>
will favor those with money, before those with the capacity. The problem is<br>
here that emotions from the parents are involved, which go against the<br>
rational theory of the free market solution. Education based on capacities<br>
rather than based on the financial situation of the parents will avoid this<br>
problem. A little extra financial backing from parents like tutoring,<br>
summer schools etc is not a big problem i think. It's the big picture i'm<br>
looking at. <br>
<p>
Problem is how to finance such an educational system without falling back<br>
on state-like practices. Ideas anyone ? Auto-financing schools involving<br>
child labor seems more than a little unethical ? However it's not such a<br>
bad idea to pay children for good school results, it will make them get<br>
used to the system they eventually get thrown into from the protective<br>
situation they were in before. Maybe parents of children who perform good,<br>
should pay less for education, and parents of children who perform bad<br>
should pay more ? Again ethical problems arise..          <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Making everyone start at zero once they reach adulthood is what I &gt;would</i><br>
call equality of opportunity, but redistributing the wealth &gt;isn't, its<br>
penalizing success.<br>
<p>
There's more to opportunity than just ones financial background. A great<br>
deal of chance is involved. The product of ones genetical and environment<br>
influences is highly subjected to that. Which is why i don't think starting<br>
at zero would make that much of a difference. <br>
<p>
Again you're forgetting the emotional side here, Parents will help their<br>
children, and why shouldn't they ? I'm not worried at all about  the extra<br>
chances a financial situation of parents gives a kid, as long as the poor<br>
kids get a chance to compete based on equal chances in education. (note not<br>
equal education: equal chances)<br>
<p>
Your suggestion still is sort of a redistribution of wealth (the starting<br>
at zero), be it in a more limited version, it will be very difficult to<br>
impose without touching individual freedom (that of the parents). Having<br>
just an educational guarantee, is more scaled down, and will guarantee<br>
survival systems almost as efficient. The problem is ofcourse who pays for<br>
that education. I'm still looking at that one ;-)  <br>
