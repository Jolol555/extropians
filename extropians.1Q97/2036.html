Brain Not Evolving Any Time Soon                   <br>
<p>
   NEW YORK (Reuters) -- If you've ever struggled through a physics class<br>
   or tried to master differential equations, you may be disappointed to<br>
   find out that humans won't be getting any smarter any time soon.<br>
                                       <br>
   The brain has reached -- or is very close to -- its maximum potential<br>
   in terms of the evolution of intelligence, according to a report in<br>
   New Scientist.<br>
<p>
   "There is no incremental improvement path available to the brain,  <br>
   which makes evolution difficult," stated researcher Chris Winter in<br>
   the article.                                         <br>
                                         <br>
   Peter Cochrane, Winter and colleagues at the Advanced Applications and<br>
   Technologies section of BT Laboratories in Ipswich, England, looked at<br>
   various brain models to determine how the organ could evolve to<br>
   process more information, or to do so more rapidly. They found that<br>
   the brain could get bigger if the heart evolved to pump more blood to<br>
   supply the additional tissue with oxygen and nutrients.<br>
                    <br>
   However, this rapidly turns into a 'chicken and egg' situation -- the<br>
   axons of nerves in a bigger brain would need to be wider to process   <br>
   information more rapidly. Therefore, each nerve axon would need more <br>
   insulation and a greater blood supply -- leaving less room for a<br>
   greater overall number of nerves. So the bigger the nerves, the<br>
   greater the blood supply they need, the more blood vessels they      <br>
   require, the less room there is for bigger nerves....              <br>
                 <br>
   While brain size is considered a relatively poor indicator of<br>
   intelligence, the number of nerves and their connections is important.<br>
   Dolphins and whales are the only animals that even come close to the<br>
   number of nerves and nerve connections found in the human brain.<br>
                                         <br>
   And if the brain was larger, nerve signals would also have farther to <br>
