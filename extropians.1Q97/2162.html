  Humans still prefer to watch cougars - or other humans, for that matter.<br>
Never mind they are a lot slower than rockets.  If they look more like you,<br>
you identify with them more.<br>

<p>
 I think it already happened with the *pace* of diversity creation.<br>
Memetic innovations (all new texts, programs and speeches generated now<br>
and stored for further selection and replication) seem a lot more<br>
dramatic and numerous than genetic innovations have ever been.<br>
<p>

<p>
  "Natural" - that is, suggested by economic utility - development of<br>
innovations would probably bring to life lots of complex information<br>
structures and some efficient generic physical media for carrying them.<br>
Those are not fun to lie under though, unlike palm trees.<br>
So somebody would have to redesign the ecologies for just that -<br>
recreational purposes.  And while humans admire diverse surfaces and shapes<br>
of the New Nature, its insides may be filled with adjustable computing<br>
architectures doing something useful, and new materials tested in multiple<br>
automated research experiments.<br>
<p>
  Supporting huge territories filled with sparse original life forms?<br>
It may be done if there is enough interest in it.  Not very often,<br>
compared with better ways of using it.   Biological world never left<br>
huge territories of bare stone to preserve the pre-biological environment,<br>
and I can't blame it.<br>
