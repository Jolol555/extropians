<i>&gt; Absolutely not.  I "cherish" most of the American English rules, but that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is one that I have declared war on.  Because I have no beef with them, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't join threads on topics such as the "corpus callosum".  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it comes to quotation marks I adhere to the dictum "Sometimes you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to flout convention and do what you feel is right.", even under fire.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel my reader has the right to know whether or not I have quoted a</i><br>
<i>&gt; complete sentence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I recognize that strict rule-followers disagree with my usage, and post</i><br>
<i>&gt; this mostly to make clear that I know the accepted usage so they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; waste their time arguing (or even noting) each case in which I stray from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rules.  I grit my teeth over bad grammar most of the time, and just</i><br>
<i>&gt; try to model the grammar rules that I espouse -- so can you.</i><br>
<p>
Hear!  Hear!<br>
<p>
It encourages me that most British newspapers have chosen to do it<br>
right, and even some American magazines have lately agreed that the<br>
old typesetter's convention is no longer useful and logically dumb.<br>
I, a "strict rule-follower", in that I believe languages and other<br>
communication standards should be objectively defined and strictly<br>
adhered to, put the damned quotes where they belong.  Since there<br>
is no standards body of the English language as there is with the<br>
French, I feel justified in claiming that duty entirely to myself<br>
(except, of course, on those few occasions I've been paid to write,<br>
where I can only voice my objection and do it their way anyway).<br>
<p>
On a more valuable topic: Have there been any serious attempts in<br>
Extropian circles to learn and spread Lojban?  I personally can't<br>
imagine anything that would have a greater positive effect on the<br>
minds of future generations.<br>
