          Right. This was what I meant when I say that the <br>
          pleasure/pain principle could play a part of its motivation <br>
          system, e.g. if that system included the value that it is <br>
          bad to mess with your own motivation system. It was <br>
          misleading of me to carchterize this as an *external* value, <br>
          though. It rather belongs to category 1b on the following <br>
          list, and should be called "internal":<br>
          <br>
          1a Internal states. E.g. Pleasure; believing a theorem<br>
          <br>
          1b Internal sequences. E. g. Pleasure stemming from a <br>
          virtuous act; Believing a certain mathematical theorem, the <br>
          belief having emerged as a result of a process that involves <br>
          ascertaining the validity of the theorem.<br>
          <br>
          2a External states. E.g. Complexity in the world.<br>
          <br>
          2b External sequences. E. g. Complexity in the world, <br>
          created by natural evolution without human intervention.<br>
          <br>

          Good comment!<br>
