Wouldn't it be a smaller region?  If the galaxy was peppered with<br>
events which normally wiped out a sphere 1000 ly in size, and we<br>
waited long enough that almost all the galaxy would have been<br>
covered a few times, then there might be a few places which were<br>
left uncovered. They would be little cracks among the bulk of the<br>
galaxy which had experienced the explosions.  So I think we would<br>
expect to find ourselves within one of those thin areas just outside<br>
the boundaries of several nearby explosions.<br>
