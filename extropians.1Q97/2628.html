<p>
I agree that it is not pragmatic to be a martyr, or otherwise and just<br>
roll over and play dead. I do not imagine that we can end violence over<br>
night, but I do think there are often non-violent alternatives that we<br>
do not take the time to think about. In order to justify itself, our<br>
military has to involve its self in warfare every once in a while. They<br>
are going to jump right into without attempting to find a non-violent<br>
alternative. Their jobs depend on it. If we question these things and<br>
express our disaproval, then we will find that we are more often finding<br>
non-violent alternatives where we would normally employ violence. This<br>
would progressively lead to the attentuation and finally the<br>
trancendance of violence. Our government truly does provoke violence. We<br>
sold Suddham Hussein many of his weapons. Do you imagine that we did not<br>
expect him to use them? Of course we did, and thus we had an excuse to<br>
start a war. Our government supplies drugs to inner cities. This has<br>
been reported in many newspapers lately. Our government fuels<br>
unneccessary violence. Watching the media, it may seem as if violence is<br>
necessary, but this is not the case. We can progressively overcome it,<br>
and we will eventually, its just a matter of will we start now or later?<br>
<p>
 <br>
We would reduce a great deal of violence by:<br>
<p>
1. Make drugs of all kinds legal.<br>
2. Stop selling and/or giving arms to third world countries.<br>
3. The United States should cease intervening in the affairs of other<br>
   countries entirely. We are not the third world police.<br>
4. Add emotive education in our public and private schools.<br>
5. Take 3/4 of the unbelievable sum we spend on the military and use   <br>
that for personalized criminal reform rather than sending people to<br>
   prisons as they exist today. [ A kid gets busted, not particularly a<br>
   bad kid yet, perhaps not too intelligent. The system sends him to<br>
   jail where he lives day in and day out with criminals, ominous<br>
   authority, and the torture of sodomy. That kid is going to change<br>
   from someone who made a mistake into a demented criminal. Lets stop<br>
   putting people in an environment which only magnifies their violent<br>
   urges. We have plenty of money to deal with this issue. Just take it<br>
   from the military.]<br>
<p>
 <br>
Then as individual's we can learn to discipline ourselves to first seek<br>
alternatives to violence before resorting to violence. I have never been<br>
in a physical fight in my life. How is that? Because I have never<br>
threatened anyone, and when someone has shown me irrational signs of<br>
violence emerging from them, I have hitherto always been able to help<br>
them see reason, to bring them down.    <br>
