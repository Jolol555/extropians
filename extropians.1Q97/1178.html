<i>&gt; Mental processes, including freewill, are still caused by deterministic</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain processes. Unless you are hinting at some mystical unkown force,</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside physical laws.</i><br>
<p>
Lot's of semantic nuances there: I certainly believe, as I think you<br>
mean to point out here, that the thing I call free will resides<br>
solely in the matter of my brain and its arrangement, and is manifested<br>
by understandable physical processes.  There is plenty of evidence<br>
for that (neurobiology), but to call these processes "deterministic"<br>
just begs the question of what free will means.  I experience it; it <br>
is there.  So far, the chemical properties of the brain that we can<br>
understand don't explain it, so we must not know everything about how<br>
those atoms behave.  I don't have to postulate that there is something<br>
other than them ("soul" or whatever), just that I don't yet know what<br>
it is about them that creates what I experience as free will.<br>
