Yes, the brain does age. Not as noticeably as other parts of the body, but<br>
it does loose some neurons and accumulate lipofuchines (sp?) and other<br>
likely waste-products. One intriguing theory about Parkinson's disease is<br>
that the neurons of the substantia nigra simply age too fast (I don't know<br>
if it has any support, though). Putting it into a new body might be<br>
helpful, but it will not solve the basic aging. <br>
<p>
It is not known how long a brain could live "on its own" (there is no such<br>
thing yet). It doesn't seem to loose efficiency as much as other parts of<br>
the body, so likely it could live beyond 110 years if the rest of the body<br>
was kept young, but we don't know for sure. <br>
