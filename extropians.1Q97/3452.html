<i>&gt; I have not been even trying to be calm ( in fact i am quite pissed off about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the whole thing) and applaud Natasha for being so diplomatic. But the main</i><br>
<i>&gt; concern for artists here is that Extropians are being censored. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are we only allowed to publish nonfiction now? Is sci fi not to be considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropic? When did this occur? Who will decide what art is correct? IMO, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be the free market.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, hogwash.  You're not being "censored" in the least--you're just<br>
being evaluated.  That's what art is for--to provoke reaction, and it<br>
did precisely that.  The fact that one particular reaction was "hey,<br>
that's a stupid idea" is just a manifestation of the free market we<br>
all value.  No one is suggesting stopping you or anyone from making<br>
whatever art you please.  We are every bit as free to judge works by<br>
our freely chosen standards as you are to make them--and to criticize<br>
us for not evaluating art by your standards.<br>
