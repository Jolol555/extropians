Actually, it was based purely on the cost of the solid rocket fuel to get<br>
the rocks out of lunar orbit, which NASA buys thousand of tons of and<br>
still pays around $30,000 per ton for (of course, they're not known for<br>
being frugal). For guidance you'd need powerful liquid-fuelled thrusters<br>
of some sort, a computer and some kind of targetting hardware. Even if you<br>
can get that down to $1000 per rock (and AFAIR a 'smart' bomb is more like<br>
$100,000) your base 6,000,000 rock attack will cost you $6 billion in<br>
guidance systems alone. <br>
<p>
Since your hardware will need to use active targetting, be able to correct<br>
its course in a split second, survive a three-day trip through space and<br>
<i>&gt;100g acceleration at launch, you're probably going to be paying a lot</i><br>
more than $1000 for it. <br>
<p>
BTW, now you're talking about pre-forming rocks that will add a<br>
significant amount to the cost of your attack. <br>
