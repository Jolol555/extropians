I think it is important to remember that evolution works even in<br>
individuals, in the selection of their memes. In an immortal,<br>
self-transforming population there will still be an evolution, but instead<br>
of dying you just accept that body- or mind-type X is better than your old<br>
and change to it, no longer improving on your old design. It will in some <br>
sense be a Lamarkian form of evolution, consciously guided by <br>
individuals. A kind of meta-evolution, where there is replication and <br>
selection for forms of evolution.<br>

Well, I would be interested in seeing what it was. I look forward to<br>
future work in this area myself. Unfortunately I think evolution<br>
(replication+variation+selection) is a very general and robust way to grow<br>
complexity, although there are other ways too. <br>
