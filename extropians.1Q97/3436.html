<i>&gt;        &gt;simply killing other companies with force is much cheaper</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ridiculous, violence is always expensive. If necessary I would spend every </i><br>
<i>&gt;cent I have to protect myself, some people don't like me but I don't think </i><br>
<i>&gt;anybody hates me enough to impoverish themselves to see to my destruction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
And it ought to be remembered that even if you interpret 'killing' in a<br>
milder sense, as in 'doing dirty deeds on the market', that too, is<br>
expensive (e.g. collusive monopoly is almost always too expensive to<br>
maintain, and can only be guaranteed by force, by government).<br>
<p>
Some thoughts:-<br>
<p>
It is usually far less costly to deal straight, especially in a  society<br>
that is ruled (i.e. ordered) by the principles people  live by (embodied<br>
in law) and not by people.<br>
<p>
And even in a society that is ruled by people, a pool of people who rule<br>
themselves by principle form a strong attractor for society as a whole,<br>
and may in the end inspire society as a whole to do the same.<br>
<p>
The political stance of libertarianism is to live and exemplary life, to<br>
embody one's principles in one's activity.  Organisation is always a<br>
secondary consideration, creating and maintaining institutions is always<br>
a secondary consideration.  First consideration is always: "Am I living<br>
by my own principles".<br>
<p>
If this isn't sorted out first, one's organisation of others, and one's<br>
ideas for the organisation of others, is poisoned by hypocrisy.<br>
<p>
Freedom is a state that must be won first of all from *within* - this is<br>
the lesson of the Sixties, in both the success and the failure of the<br>
politics of the Sixties.  <br>
<p>
This is the real reason for the resurgence of classical liberalism, in<br>
its dual 'entryism' as libertarianism in the Right, and the gradual<br>
ditching of 'top-down' solutions in the Left.<br>
<p>
