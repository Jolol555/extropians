Sasha wrote 2/25/97 about Soros: &lt;I read about half of his book, and found<br>
his philosophy as unimpressive as his market knowledge was sophisticated. <br>
I don't know that much about him though.  Recently, I read an excellent<br>
review of Soros's ideas and activities, and problems of his organization in<br>
Telepolis - &lt;<a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/tp.html">http://www.heise.de/tp/tp.html</a>&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I am in agreement with your assessment of his philosophy.  A friend<br>
recently sent me a critique of his self-contradictory philosophy, and I<br>
will forward it here:<br>

"George Soros, Positivist in a Poke"<br>
  by Carl Jahnes  2/2/97<br>
<p>
Now comes George Soros, investor extrordinaire, with his view on  "The<br>
Capitalist Threat" in the February '97 issue of "The Atlantic".<br>
<p>
Soros says that when a "system" seeks to become "absolute truth," it then<br>
feels that it must compel those who don't buy into its postulates... it<br>
feels it must compel them to "be free," or to do the actions it defines are<br>
in everyones' best interests... it must force them to do the acts it<br>
defines as the good life.  He rather says that we must come to a belief in<br>
the fallibility of ALL systems (and I think he is talking about political<br>
"ideologies").  He says (and all quoted lines are from the article, pp. 55<br>
&amp; 58):<br>
<p>
  "All cultures and religions offer such standards (criteria of truth); the<br>
open society cannot do without them.  The innovation in an open society is<br>
that whereas most cultures and religions regard their own values as<br>
absolute, an open society, which is aware of many cultures and religions,<br>
must regard its own shared values as a matter of debate and choice."<br>
<p>
Soros is falling for the old siren song of Positivism.  He refuses to see<br>
his own axiom which he places 'beyond' the "...matter of debate and<br>
choice," and that is, that "An Open Society is the type of society we<br>
should have."  Or to state it another way, "An Open Society is the Best<br>
Society."  He does not see that he must place this 'beyond' debate, in<br>
order to maintain the conditions FOR debate, which allows Openness of<br>
debate to prevail!  Continuing...<br>
<p>
  "To make the debate possible, there must be general agreement on at least<br>
one point: that an open society is a desirable form of social organization.<br>
 People must be free to think and act, subject only to limits imposed by<br>
the common interests."<br>
<p>
But aren't "common interests" debated in an "open society"?<br>
<p>
  "The D of I may be taken as a pretty good approximation of the principles<br>
of an open society, but instead of claiming that those principles are<br>
self-evident, we ought to say that they are consistent with our<br>
fallibility.  Could the recognition of our imperfect understanding serve to<br>
establish the open society as a desirable form of social organization?  I<br>
believe it could, although there are formidable difficulties in the way. <br>
We must promote a belief in our own fallibility to the status that we<br>
normally confer on a belief in ultimate truth."<br>
<p>
There are problems with this analysis.  If our "axiom," that "An Open<br>
Society is Best," proceeds from us, then it is a product of our<br>
"fallibility."  Later, (and I'll quote it) Soros betrays his<br>
Utilitarianism.  <br>
<p>
  "But if ultimate truth is not attainable, how can we accept our<br>
fallibility as ultimate truth?<br>
<p>
  "This is an apparent paradox, but it can be resolved.  The first<br>
proposition, that our understanding is imperfect, is consistent with the<br>
second proposition; that we must accept the first proposition as an article<br>
of faith."<br>
<p>
Voila!<br>
<p>
  "The need for articles of faith arises exactly because our understanding<br>
is imperfect.  If we enjoyed perfect knowledge, there would be no need for<br>
beliefs.  But to accept this line of reasoning requires a profound change<br>
in the role that we accord our beliefs."<br>
<p>
  "Historically, beliefs have served to justify rules of conduct. <br>
Fallibility ought to foster a different attitude.  Beliefs ought to shape<br>
our lives, not to make us abide by a given set of rules."<br>
<p>
This is so convoluted that I have to stop.  Soros' reasoning is not<br>
penetrating the wet paper bag he's in!  To say, "if we enjoyed perfect<br>
knowledge, there would be no need for beliefs," is ridiculous.  I believe<br>
that 2 + 2 = 4, because it is true that 2 + 2 = 4.  Soros is thinking that<br>
in a perfect world, there would be no "freedom" to choose falsehood, rather<br>
than the truth.  This itself, is a "belief," and is an axiom he has placed<br>
in front of his so-called reasoning which is beyond "...debate and choice."<br>
<p>
He also says, "...Beliefs have served to justify rules of conduct" and that<br>
 "Beliefs ought to shape our lives, not to make us abide by a given set of<br>
rules."  Well, if our lives have "shape" and have "form," if they are<br>
ordered according to the axiomatic faith that "An Open Society is Best,"<br>
then our conduct which serves to support the existence of this "shape of<br>
life" could be abstracted into "rules."  For there would be some<br>
"character" to our lives, which we call "shape," which could be described<br>
so that we understand what this shape "is."  Like describing the "shape" of<br>
a table to understand why it is not "a wheel."  And so, if beliefs "shape"<br>
our lives, the acts which make up this shape, in that they conform to the<br>
axiom which asserts what the "good shape" of society "is," are "rules." <br>
Let Soros continue to thrash...<br>
<p>
  "If we recognize that our beliefs are expressions of our choices, not of<br>
ultimate truth,  we are more likely to tolerate other beliefs and revise<br>
our own in the light of our experiences.  But that is not how most people<br>
treat their beliefs.  They tend to identify their beliefs with ultimate<br>
truth.  Indeed, that identification often serves to define their own<br>
identity.  If their experience of living in an open society obliges them to<br>
gvie up their claim to ultimate truth, they feel a sense of loss."<br>
<p>
Well, it *would* be a loss, because to accept the axiom that "An Open<br>
Society Is Best," is the same sort of faith - belief - that a religious<br>
person exercises in HIS object of faith.  Soros is trying to make "the Open<br>
Society" self-evident in the way Positivists do, by assuming its truth and<br>
not recognizing that this "truth" is an assumption which must, if it is to<br>
find "form" and "shape" in lives, must be identified AS a subset of<br>
"Ultimate Truth," and must be protected by an Institution, which PUTS its<br>
ultimate truth beyond debate.<br>
<p>
Soros thinks that if we accept our "fallibility" on faith, then this can<br>
"ground" the Open Society, can "protect" it magically, because by placing<br>
our relentless urge to find where Truth is Unified, where it is Ultimate,<br>
beyond debate, it must logically follow that Society Must Be Open To All<br>
Opinions, To All Debate, To All Choice.  But this is fallacious.  If we are<br>
'fallible,' then the axiom that "Society Must Be Open... blah, blah" is<br>
ALSO fallible, and does not necessarily follow any less than its opposite,<br>
"Society Must Be Closed....blah, blah."  Let me just keep typing Soros, so<br>
you get the gist...<br>
<p>
  "The idea that we somehow embody the ultimate truth..."<br>
<p>
Why "embody"?  All we were doing before was "believing" it!  <br>
<p>
  "is deeply ingrained in our thinking.  We may be endowed with critical<br>
faculties, but we are inseparably tied to ourselves.  We may have<br>
discovered truth and morality, but, above all, we must represent our<br>
interests and our selves.  Therefore, if there are such things as truth and<br>
justice..."<br>
<p>
Remember, in an "Open Society," the existence of truth and justice are<br>
matters of debate and choice...<br>
<p>
  "and we have come to believe that there are - then we want to be in<br>
possession of them.  We demand truth from religion, and recently, from<br>
science.  A belief in our fallibility is a poor substitute.  It is a highly<br>
sophisticated concept, much more difficult to work with than more primitive<br>
beliefs, such as my country (or my company or my family) right or wrong."<br>
<p>
  "If the idea of our fallibility is so hard to take, what makes it so<br>
appealing?  The most powerful argument in its favor is to be found in the<br>
results it produces."<br>
<p>
Here's the Utilitarianism.<br>
<p>
  "Open societies tend to be more prosperous, more innovative, more<br>
stimulating than closed ones.  But there is a danger in proposing success<br>
as the sole basis for holding a belief, because if my theory of reflexivity<br>
is valid...."<br>
<p>
He's defined "reflexivity" as "feedback which helps create course<br>
corrections."  The Open Society allows this to happen, of course!<br>
<p>
  "being successful is not identical with being right.  In natural science,<br>
theories have to be right... for them to work....  But in the social sphere<br>
what is effective is not necessarily identical with what is right, because<br>
of the reflexive connection between thinking and reality.  As I hinted<br>
earlier, the cult of success can become a source of instability in an open<br>
society, because it can undermine our sense of right and wrong."<br>
<p>
Apparently there is "much more" which is a matter of "belief" in this Open<br>
Society (right and wrong).<br>
<p>
  "That is what is happening in our society today.  Our sense of right and<br>
wrong is endangered by our preoccupation with success, as measured by<br>
money.  Anything goes, as long as you can get away with it."  <br>
<p>
Skipping a paragraph, and continuing...<br>
<p>
  "The concept of the open society needs to be more firmly grounded.  There<br>
has to be a commitment to the open society because it is the right form of<br>
social organization.  Such a commitment is hard to come by."<br>
<p>
INDEED!  For, according to Soros, it "must" be what it cannot be,<br>
Ultimately True that the Open Society is Best!  Soros is left to his own<br>
feeble "belief statements," as we see, continuing...<br>
<p>
  "I believe in the open society because it allows us to develop our<br>
potential better than a social system that claims to be in the possession<br>
of ultimate truth."<br>
<p>
Yawning contradiction!  <br>
<p>
  "...Accepting the unattainable character of truth offers a better<br>
prospect for freedom and prosperity than denying it.  But I recognize a<br>
problem here; I am sufficiently committed to the pursuit of truth to find<br>
the case for the open society convincing, but I am not sure that other<br>
people will share my point of view.  Given the reflexive connection between<br>
thinking and reality, truth is not indispensable for success.  It may be<br>
possible to attain specific objectives by twisting or denying the truth,<br>
and people may be more interested in obtaining their specific objectives<br>
than in attaining truth.  Only at the highest level of abstraction, when we<br>
consider the whole meaning of life, does truth take on paramount<br>
importance."<br>
<p>
Yawning blind spot.  If it is not 'true' that *Open Society Is Best*, and<br>
if there does not exist an Institution to protect and defend this Truth, to<br>
put it "beyond debate," "beyond choice," "beyond attack," then, one can<br>
"choose" the closed society, and that "choice" is just as valid as its<br>
opposite.<br>
<p>
  "Even then, deception may be preferable to the truth, because life<br>
entails death and death is difficult to accept.  Indeed, one could argue<br>
that the open society is the best form of society for making the most of<br>
life, whereas the closed society is the form best suited to the acceptance<br>
of death.  In the ultimate analysis a belief in an open society is a matter<br>
of choice, not of logical necessity!"<br>
<p>
O Yawning Blind Spot!<br>
<p>
 "That is not all.  Even if the concept of the open society were<br>
universally accepted, that would not be sufficient to ensure that freedom<br>
and prosperity would prevail.  The open society merely provides a framework<br>
within which different views about social and political issues can be<br>
reconciled; it does not offer a firm view on social goals.  If it did, it<br>
would not be an open society."<br>
<p>
Yawning contradiction!  "If an Open Society does not allow for the "choice"<br>
to be made which would transform this Open Society into a Closed Society,<br>
then it is Not An Open Society."<br>
<p>
  "This means that people must hold other beliefs in addition to their<br>
belief in the open society.  Only in a closed society does the concept of<br>
an open society provide a sufficient basis for political action; in an open<br>
society it is not enough to be a democrat; one must be a liberal democrat<br>
of a social democrat or a Christian democrat or some other kind of<br>
democrat.  A shared belief in the open society is a necessary but not<br>
sufficient condition for freedom and prosperity and all the good things<br>
that the open society is supposed to bring."<br>
<p>
Yes, "...necessary, but not sufficient condition," the *necessary and<br>
sufficient* condition is the reasoning which "proves" that it is True that<br>
the Open Society is Best, such that it can be "defended."<br>
<p>
  "It can be seen that the concept of the open society is a seemingly<br>
inexhaustible source of difficulties.  That is to be expected.  After all,<br>
the open society is based upon a recognition of our fallibility.  Indeed it<br>
stands to reason that our ideal of the open society is unattainable.  To<br>
have a blueprint for it would be self contradictory.  That does not mean we<br>
should not strive for it.  In science also, ultimate truth is<br>
unattainable." <br>
<p>
Soros can't see his own contradictions.  Would he call it a "blueprint" for<br>
the Open Society to be defended from becoming a Closed Society by the very<br>
conditions of "debate" and "choice" it allows?  Would he call it a<br>
"blueprint" for the Open Society to be grounded in an article of "faith"<br>
that "We are Fallible"?  If we feel we are fallible, then, it supposedly<br>
stands to reason that debate should never be closed off, in the sense that<br>
its products become Ultimate Truth... but then, wouldn't the statement that<br>
"We are Fallible" ITSELF be fallible?  Why should it be believed over any<br>
other statement?<br>
<p>
The Open Society *itself* is an article of faith.  My opinion is that the<br>
Open Society is a Product of Christendom.  Why?  The answer is theological,<br>
and reasonable.  If God does not "force" us to believe in Him, if He gives<br>
us freedom, TRUE freedom to accept Him or reject Him, then we should accord<br>
no less freedom to our neighbor than He does.  If this is "truth" inherent<br>
in Reality, because God intended it to be this way, then it is a matter of<br>
"virtue" that we preserve the kind of social conditions in which this<br>
Freedom can take "shape," and can "be real."  Therefore, it is Good that<br>
the Open Society Exist, and that it continue to exist when choices are made<br>
to 'close' it.  For no man knows the mind of God, and if you buy what God<br>
says about you and me, our fallibility ALSO is established, and so Openness<br>
serves as a "defense" against our falliblity.  And, there must be an<br>
Institution which can "defend" and "fight for" this Openness, when choices<br>
are made, in the name of Openness, to Close it off.<br>
<p>
Yours in laying bare attacks on Western Civilization, Carl.<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
P.S.  For my own part, I see Soros as having bought into the nonsensical<br>
political correctness slowly poisoning our academic institutions of higher<br>
learning; Allan Bloom's phrase springs to mind, "openness to closedness." <br>
The Open Society is defenseless to those who would openly choose to close<br>
it, the monoculturalists who masquerade as multiculturalists.  The one<br>
culture that prevails in an undefended Open Society of Soros' fantasy, is<br>
the culture of death.<br>
