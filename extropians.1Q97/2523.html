From: Anders Sandberg &lt;nv91-asa@nada.kth.se&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; A bit like what happens in _Permutation City_, but remember what Durham</i><br>
<i>&gt; did.</i><br>
<p>
This is a version of that scenario that I could accept.  I don't remember<br>
if this is exactly how it was done in the book, but it was something<br>
like this.  I am an upload, so it is pretty easy to copy myself.<br>
I make a copy which is intended to live for only a moment.  The copy is<br>
distinguished from me in that it starts out in a world where there is<br>
a sign saying "you are the copy".  It sees that for less than a second,<br>
then it is instantly terminated.<br>
<p>
It would take some courage for me to set up this situation, and some<br>
people would be unwilling to do it.  The copy is going to *die*.<br>
However since it will only have a fraction of a second of different<br>
experiences from the other instance, not much is lost.  I have convinced<br>
myself that when I run the experiment and push the button, if I see the<br>
sign appear saying "you are the copy", I am willing to accept that my<br>
existence will terminate a moment later, knowing that another version<br>
of me will go on.  I'll squeeze my eyes shut, cringe, and wait for the<br>
inevitable, knowing that it will be quick and painless.<br>
<p>
According to the Moravec/Egan theory, when I run this experiment, if<br>
I do find myself as the copy, I will not find my existence terminated.<br>
After a few seconds, I will open my eyes disbelievingly.  The sign is<br>
still there saying that I am the copy, but my program is still running.<br>
<p>
Something has gone wrong.  Maybe there was a glitch in the program which<br>
was supposed to terminate me, maybe the other instance of me changed<br>
his mind at the last minute and cancelled the termination, maybe, as<br>
in Egan's story, I learn that the whole thing was an insane fantasy and<br>
now I can begin the long struggle back towards sanity.<br>
<p>
What has happened is this.  There are an infinite number of possible<br>
universes, but only a finite number of possible mental states for me.<br>
That means that for any mental state, there are an infinite number of<br>
instances of myself experiencing that state.  When something happens<br>
which has a random component (as everything does), some of those instances<br>
experience it one way and some experience it another.<br>
<p>
If something happens to kill some of them, others will survive, because<br>
although their mental states were the same, some other aspects of the<br>
universe may have been different; or because the random event which<br>
killed some did not happen that way in other universes.  No matter<br>
what happens, some, an infinite number in fact, will survive.<br>
<p>
It follows that everyone who has ever died in fact still lives.  To their<br>
surprise, something happened which allowed their existence to continue.<br>
I don't really know how the cavemen have managed to live for thousands of<br>
years; maybe it turned out that aliens were watching them and swooped down<br>
in the moment of death to rescue them, or maybe they were resurrected<br>
out of a Tipler simulation.  Generally we can expect to witness the least<br>
improbable event which allows us to stay alive.<br>
<p>
This leads to the well known test of the theory, which is to try killing<br>
yourself and see if it works.  But this has the drawback that if the<br>
theory is wrong, you are dead.  That's why I like the uploading scenario,<br>
since that is one circumstance in which I might be willing to try<br>
experiencing death.<br>
<p>
Of course, if I run the experiment and end up as the original, then I<br>
don't know the answer.  I see the copy die.  Did it go on living in<br>
some other universe?  There is no way to know.  I could run the experiment<br>
multiple times, so that the chances that I will end up as the copy sometime<br>
become larger (in some sense).  But there will always be an instance which<br>
has never experienced being the copy, so it's not clear whether to think<br>
of this as helping answer the question.<br>
<p>
It's also worth noting that Everett's many-worlds interpretation of QM<br>
makes roughly the same predictions, so you don't have to swallow all<br>
the baggage of platonic materialism.  You can still hope that reports<br>
of your death will be "greatly exaggerated."<br>
