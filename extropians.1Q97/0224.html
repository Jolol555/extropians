Mark Crosby quoted something from the Wall Street Journal which talked about <br>
how Christ introduced the idea that people should bow to God rather than to <br>
other people.  He then speculated that once this idea was established in the <br>
minds of people, it was a short step from there to bowing only to the laws of <br>
nature and one's own creativity.<br>
<p>
I had a similar experience in my religion when I was younger.  I was raised in <br>
the Mormon Church (a branch of Christianity, although quite different in many <br>
ways than typical Christianity).  I developed an intense interest in the <br>
Church when I was fourteen, and many of the doctrines appealed to me quite a <br>
bit, such as the idea of receiving direct revelation from God and the idea <br>
that we were supposed to learn to maintain a constant connection with God so <br>
that God could help us with our lives and teach us many lessons throughout the <br>
day.  Also, the central doctrine of Mormonism is that our entire purpose is to <br>
learn how to become Gods ourselves and that our lives on earth are for the <br>
purpose of learning the lessons required for godhood and developing more of <br>
the self-discipline required for godhood. <br>
<p>
These doctrines were very attractive to me, and I began to open myself up to <br>
receiving revelations from God and allowing myself to be directed in my daily <br>
activities by God.  For me, this marked a shift in Authority Figures, where <br>
God became more of an Authority to me than any other person in my life.  What <br>
I felt God wanted me to do meant much more to me than what my parents or <br>
anyone else wanted me to do.  This transition was easy to make since all the <br>
other Authority Figures in my life endorsed the religion, so I felt my <br>
reliance on God was what I was supposed to do.<br>
<p>
Then, when I was eighteen years old, I realized fully one evening that God was <br>
a self-generated entity in my own mind, that I had no real evidence to support <br>
my belief in that being.  I had actually experienced many "revelations", where <br>
I learned many important lessons and had many great insights, but I realized <br>
that these were self-generated also.  Since God had been my Major Authority <br>
Figure, and since I realized that God was self-generated, I suddenly became my <br>
own Authority Figure, relying only on my own understanding and desires to <br>
guide my life.<br>
<p>
So, for me, my religion (and my deep desire to understand the way things are) <br>
was an excellent stepping stone for becoming my own Authority.  From my <br>
parents and teachers to God and from God to myself.  I wonder how common this <br>
transition is.  Has anyone here experienced anything like this?<br>
