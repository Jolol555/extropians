Stuart A. Kauffman, "The Origins of Order", Oxford University Press<br>
(1993), pp. 29-30.<br>
<p>
The first part of the book, Chapters 2 to 6, stalks answers to new<br>
questions: What kinds of complex systems can evolve by accumulation of<br>
successive useful variations? Does selection achieve complex systems able<br>
to adapt? Are there lawful properties characterizing such systems? The<br>
overall answer may be that complex systems constructed such that they are<br>
poised on the boundary between order and chaos are the ones best able to<br>
adapt by mutation and selection. Such poised systems appear to be best<br>
able to coordinate complex, flexible behaviour and best able to respond<br>
to changes in their environment. I suggest that selection does achieve<br>
and maintain such poised systems. Further, beyond the selective molding<br>
of individual adaptive systems, there are provocative, promising<br>
indications that linked coevolving complex systems are led by selection,<br>
as though by an invisible hand, to form ecosystems whose members mutually<br>
attain the edge of chaos. Here all may sustain the highest expected<br>
fitness, even while avalanches of coevolutionary changes propagate<br>
through the ecosystem, ringing out old species and ringing in new ones.<br>
<p>
These are new issues in our understanding of the evolution of life.<br>
Darwin told us that adaptive evolution occurs by gradual accumulation of<br>
useful variants but failed to tell us what kinds of systems can evolve<br>
successfully by random variation and selection for fitter variants. It is<br>
remarkably easy to lay our minds around this set of issues. Most readers<br>
will be familiar with programs for contemporary sequential processing<br>
computers. The issue is this: How readily might a process of random<br>
mutation and selection operating on the instructions in a computer<br>
program succeed at attaining a complex program to carry out a desired<br>
computation? It is clear that evolution of useful sequential programs is<br>
very difficult for several reasons, the most obvious being that almost<br>
all random alteration in the code wreak dramatic changes in the<br>
computation being performed.<br>
<p>
Adaptive evolution occurs largely by the successive accumulation of minor<br>
variations in phenotype. The simple example of computer programs makes it<br>
clear that not all complex systems are graced with the property that a<br>
minor change in system _structure_ typically leads to a minor change in<br>
system _behaviour_. In short, as their internal structure is modified,<br>
some systems change behaviour relatively smoothly, some relatively<br>
radically. Thus we confront the question of whether selective evolution<br>
is able to "tune" the structure of complex evolving systems such that<br>
they evolve readily.<br>
<p>
The variability in behaviour as the structure of a system is altered can<br>
be pictured as characterizing the ruggedness of a fitness landscape. In<br>
Chapters 2 and 3 we shall discuss the concept of such landscapes. In<br>
particular, we shall focus on the simple case of protein molecules in<br>
"sequence spaces", where each protein is located next to a large number<br>
of other proteins which differ from it at only one amino acid position.<br>
The capacity of each protein to carry out some specified function allows<br>
us to define the fitness landscape over protein space with respect to<br>
that function. Here fitness peaks represent either local or global optima<br>
for such a function. As we shall see, such landscapes range from smooth<br>
and single-peaked to very rugged and multipeaked.<br>
<p>
The character of adaptive evolution depends on the structure of such<br>
fitness landscapes. Most critically, we shall find that, as the<br>
complexity of the system under selection increases, selection is<br>
progressively less able to alter the properties of the system. Thus, even<br>
in the presence of continuing selection, complex systems tend to remain<br>
typical members of the ensemble of possibilities of from which they are<br>
drawn. We shall find in this book many examples of spontaneous order present<br>
in entire ensembles of complex systems. Thus if selection, when operating<br>
on complex systems which spontaneously exhibit profound order, is unable<br>
to avoid that spontaneous order, that order will "shine through". In<br>
short, this theme, central to our concerns, states that much of the<br>
orders in organisms may be spontaneous. Rather than reflecting selection's<br>
successes, such order, remarkably, may reflect selection's failure.<br>
