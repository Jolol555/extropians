                          UPI Science News 	<br>
	WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UPI) -- The world's first atom laser which shoots  <br>
highly controlled particles of matter rather than light has been built <br>
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, physicists reported <br>
Monday. <br>
	Experts suggest the achievement may lead to more precise navigation  <br>
equipment and machine tools as well as smaller, more efficient computer <br>
chips. <br>
	The Cambridge, Mass.-based researchers published their findings in  <br>
the current issue of Physical Review Letters and in Thursday's issue of <br>
the journal Science. <br>
	Wolfgang Ketterle, senior researcher on the project, described the  <br>
discovery as ``exceeding all expectations.'' The laser is based on <br>
predictions made 70 years ago by Albert Einstein and Indian physicist <br>
Satyendra Nath Bose, but no one was sure such a device could ever be <br>
made. <br>
	The more familiar photon laser, which shoots particles of light, was  <br>
discovered in 1960. Thirty-five years later, its presence is nearly <br>
ubiquitous in grocery scanners, CD players, communications, etching <br>
machines, cosmetic surgery, and other applications. <br>
	In contrast, the new laser shoots atoms. Both kinds of lasers,  <br>
however, line up the particles into what Ketterle calls ``one coherent <br>
dance.'' They are synchronized in wavelength and phase rather than <br>
randomly flitting around. <br>
	The atom laser uses ultracold particles of sodium. At temperatures  <br>
more than a million times colder than outer space, atoms lose their <br>
individuality and begin acting as one. This new state of matter, called <br>
Bose-Einstein concentrate or BEC, was first reported in July 1995 by <br>
physicists at the National Institute for Standards and Technology and <br>
the Unversity of Colorado. <br>
	``I don't think any of us thought this (atom laser) would happen, if  <br>
ever, for at least several years,'' said Randall Hulet of Rice <br>
University in Houston. ``It's a really incredible demonstration.'' <br>
	Atoms in BEC state require a magnetic trap inside a vacuum chamber to  <br>
isolate them from the ``scorching'' temperatures of the everyday world. <br>
The achievement of Ketterle's group was to extract sodium BEC from the <br>
magnetic trap in a controlled fashion and show that they were still <br>
coherent. <br>
	Ketterle's graduate student, Michael Andrews, said BEC particles  <br>
``all like to be in the same state of motion, or do the same thing'' <br>
because even particles of matter share some of the wave-like behavior of <br>
light, radio waves, and other types of energy. Normally, the atoms are <br>
too far apart and their wavelengths are much too small for this <br>
characteristic to noticeably influence them. <br>
	But as atoms are cooled to near -460 degrees Fahrenheit (-273 degrees  <br>
Celsius) -- called absolute zero, where all motion stops -- their <br>
wavelengths eventually match the distance they are to one another. They <br>
fall into synch, and begin behaving as one entity. <br>
	And when particles are coherent, they become highly predictable and  <br>
controllable. <br>
	What Andrews describes as ``the ultimate control of matter'' will  <br>
help physicists better isolate and understand the influences that atoms <br>
experience. <br>
	``Atomic clocks are essential for state-of-the-art navigation  <br>
systems,'' Andrews said. Global-positioning satellites use these highly <br>
precise timekeepers to pinpoint locations, for example. Ever finer <br>
calibrations will reduce margins of error. <br>
	William Phillips of NIST in Gaithersburg, Md., said he currently sees  <br>
the best opportunity in nanotechnology. The tiny wavelength of the atom <br>
laser may ``do better writing on permanent structures such as computer <br>
chips,'' he said, packing in more memory or functions on chips of <br>
current technology. <br>
	Even nanomachines -- molecular structures with moving parts -- may  <br>
cross the threshold from science fiction to reality. <br>
	``I don't know how realistic that is, but we're now at the stage  <br>
where we can find out,'' Phillips said. ``No one knew what a photon <br>
laser was good for in 1960 either.'' <br>
