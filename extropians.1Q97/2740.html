The possibility that a Quantum Computer might be built in the foreseeable <br>
future has even started to seep into the mainstream press, there is an<br>
article about them in today's (Feb. 18 1997) New York Times. There are no<br>
new facts the article, but it does contain several quotations I have not seen <br>
before that express the air of enthusiasm and optimism currently in the field. <br>
<p>
Dr. Raymond Laflamme at the  Los Alamos Laboratory says:<br>
<p>
 "Just a few years ago it was thought that a Quantum Computer was impossible.  <br>
  Now we have passes some big stumbling blocks. The possibilities are very  <br>
  exciting."<br>
<p>
Dr. Seth Lloyd at MIT says:<br>
    <br>
 "Although large hurdles lie ahead, Quantum Computers are coming tantalizingly<br>
  close to being something that might work".<br>
<p>
I thought the most interesting quote came from Rolf W Landauer at IBM.  <br>
Dr. Landauer was probably the most vocal critic of the entire idea of a <br>
Quantum Computer, and he makes it clear that he is still not convinced that <br>
such a machine will ever be practical. He does admit however that in late <br>
1995 when Dr. Peter Shor of ATT proved that Quantum Error correction was not<br>
impossible after all and actually produced such a scheme, and when a few <br>
months later Dr. Wojciech Zurek at Los Alamos considerably improved it:<br>
<p>
 "Nobody was more surprised than I was. I had been too pessimistic, it's  <br>
 just that simple".<br>
<p>
To remind you of the stakes that are involved, a 2000 cubit Quantum Computer <br>
would be far more powerful than a Nano computer made with all the matter in <br>
the observable universe.<br>
