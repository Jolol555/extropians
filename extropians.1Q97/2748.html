to drop some memes.  There seem to be events taking place nationwide <br>
on April 17, maybe one in your area.  <br>

Reinventing The American Dream for the 21st Century:<br>
<p>
<p>
FIRST NATIONWIDE DELIBERATION DAY WILL ENGAGE <br>
YOUNG ADULTS IN DISCUSSION ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE <br>
<p>
PHILADELPHIA, February 17 -- In what has been described as the first forum of<br>
its kind, The Foundation for Individual Responsibility and Social Trust<br>
(FIRST) will host the first annual National Deliberation Day (NDD) on and<br>
around April 17, the birthday of Thomas Jefferson.   FIRST is coordinating<br>
local discussions at sites throughout the country wherein young adults, 18-35<br>
years old, will participate in half day discussions designed to develop a new<br>
vision for the American Dream in the next century. <br>
	"Young adults all too often are branded with the Generation X label,  with<br>
the implication that we are apathetic, have little to contribute, and are not<br>
interested in being involved in the political process," said David Surbeck,<br>
FIRST executive director.  "From the growing interest in National<br>
Deliberation Day from young adults throughout the country, we should be able<br>
to put a stop to those opinions once and for all."   Events are already<br>
planned in cities across the country, including San Francisco, Atlanta,<br>
Austin, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Delware, Lincoln, Nebraska, and South Bend,<br>
Indiana, to name a few.<br>
	While most discussions are scheduled for April 17, some local activities may<br>
take place at other times depending on local circumstances, dates and times<br>
most convenient for local participants.  <br>
	Surbeck noted that every effort is being made to recruit a diverse and<br>
representative group of participants at each location, including a national<br>
outreach effort to complement local activities.  Following National<br>
Deliberation Day, the results will be compiled and a public report issued.<br>
 Further, the results will be integrated into discussion materials for<br>
FIRST's National Issues Convention scheduled for October.<br>
	FIRST received media and public attention when it hosted the country's first<br>
national issues convention for young adults in Philadelphia during National<br>
Constitution Week, September, 1996.   "We The Future...A National Issues<br>
Convention for Young Adults" hosted delegates of every political persuasion<br>
from business, non-profit groups, community groups, unions, and colleges and<br>
universities.  Delegates created a national issues platform for the future<br>
and shared it with Presidential candidates for their comments and responses.<br>
	National Deliberation Day is part of  FIRST's continuing efforts to create<br>
new and meaningful ways for young adults to add their voice to the political<br>
process.  Through National Deliberation Days, yearly issues conventions, the<br>
development  of local chapters, and an education program, FIRST plans to<br>
change the way young adults participate in politics. "Our goal is to provide<br>
opportunities for non-partisan deliberation so that voice of young people is<br>
heard above the din of special interest groups," noted Surbeck.<br>
	The Foundation For Individual Responsibility and Social Trust is a<br>
non-partisan, non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization devoted to making<br>
involvement in the political process meaningful for young adults.<br>
 Headquartered in Philadelphia, FIRST promotes the use of dialogue about the<br>
future of the nation in order to stimulate involvement by young adults in<br>
creating new ways to resolve national issues.  <br>
