 Cryonics is important and should be explored, <br>
but it should not distract from our true goals.<br>
We want metamorphosis not stasis.<br>
I confidently say few of us want to specificly become a frozen mom/popsicle <br>
for the rest of eternity.<br>
We would be intact, alas slightly dead is still too dead.<br>
We want to evolve into a dynamic state more able to acheive our dreams.<br>
<p>
 Cryonics only allows more time to wait for technology to develop <br>
that will suit our needs for repair/augmentation <br>
and will eventually not be needed.<br>
Given time it will evolve <br>
into a portable and immediate sort of suspension <br>
which will be used to halt damage( ie. paramedics transporting patients ).<br>
A useful device for all but the metamorphosist <br>
who would not allow it's self to become damaged <br>
and that is what we intend to become.<br>
<p>
 In closing I wish to remind all that the future is where success will be.<br>
When you walk keep your eyes looking forward.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -How best we can spread our beliefs?</i><br>
<p>
Let every one know they are already allies.<br>
promote the most fundamental beliefs that all share <br>
in new and universally beneficial ways.<br>
Use simple well liked words <br>
that imply what you are saying yet have no fixed meanings <br>
and link them to words you want people to think about.<br>
<p>
&lt;Gentic engineering&gt;<br>
Why shave your legs <br>
when you can shave your genes?<br>
<p>
&lt;Space colonization&gt;<br>
In search of the heart and soul of love and life,<br>
to make the world a better place,<br>
to give to all friendship and peace,<br>
I'll take my quest to outer space.<br>
<p>
Do you think I could be a commercial pitch man?<br>
