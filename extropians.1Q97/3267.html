Subject: Clinton vs human cloning : Pres ignores self-ownership<br>
<p>
<p>
	In a blatant display of political oportunism, President Clinton shows<br>
a sudden concern for ethics. He presumes to impose archaic<br>
authoritarian religious views in an attack on the forefront of modern<br>
science and the basis of all human rights : self-ownership.<br>
<p>
	Pandering to the worst reactionary authoritarian statist elements of<br>
the Millenium, Clinton seeks a "commission"  { an Inquisition is more<br>
like it) to study human cloning.<br>
<p>
	Clinton and those he seeks to appease on the statist Left &amp; Right<br>
ignore the simple human fact of self-ownership. If human beings do not<br>
have the right to clone themselves they do not have the right to<br>
reproduce in any form without government consent. The level of<br>
techonology is irrelevant to the simple fact that humans have the<br>
right to dispose of their own tissue in any way they see fit. The<br>
alternative is state-ownership of human beings. This is unconscionable<br>
both ethically and scientifically.<br>
<p>
	Basic laws protect the rights of humans from enslavement  that<br>
opponents of human cloning pretend to fear in their simplistic<br>
propaganda. In reality, authoritarians of both the right and the left<br>
seek control over human life. Rulers and would-be rulers seek to use<br>
the issue of cloning to establish the principle of state-ownership of<br>
human life.<br>
<p>
	Niether scientists nor the public can allow this to happen. We need to<br>
have freedom to experiment so that viruses and all other infectious<br>
agents can be defeated as fast (or hopeully faster) than they can<br>
evolve. Limiting the rights of people to donate their tissue to<br>
medical science for these or any other purposes is to doom humanity to<br>
death from emergent viral and other pathogenic infections.<br>
Biotechnology and medicine in other areas may al;so benefit from human<br>
cloning in ways we cannot even imgaine now.<br>
<p>
	But , most importanly, banning human cloning will establish the right<br>
of the State to control human reproduction and human life in toto, by<br>
establishing the precedent created by such a law as Clinton and others<br>
are seeking.<br>
