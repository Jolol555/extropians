Back-cover text:<br>
<p>
Nature abounds in systems involving the actions of simple,<br>
locally-interacting components, that give rise to coordinated global<br>
behavior.  These collective systems have evolved by means of natural<br>
selection to exhibit striking problem-solving capacities, while<br>
functioning within a complex, dynamic environment.  Employing simple<br>
yet versatile parallel cellular models, coupled with evolutionary<br>
computation techniques, this volume explores the issue of constructing<br>
man-made systems that exhibit characteristics such as those manifest<br>
by their natural counterparts.<br>
<p>
Parallel cellular machines hold potential both scientifically, as<br>
vehicles for studying phenomena of interest in areas such as complex<br>
adaptive systems and artificial life, as well as practically, enabling<br>
the construction of novel systems, endowed with evolutionary,<br>
reproductive, regenerative, and learning capabilities.  This<br>
self-contained volume examines the behavior of such machines, the<br>
complex computation they exhibit, and the application of artificial<br>
evolution to attain such systems.<br>
