(list seems to be down (too often, imo), ignore this if you see it twice)<br>
<p>
Doubtlessly I am not the only one who is plagued by a stream of directly <br>
mailed advertisements. Though one has been pavlov's into recognizing them <br>
in milliseconds and then reflexively hitting delete, they are still a major <br>
nuisance.<br>
<p>
Apart from deleting <a href="mailto:">mailto:</a> tags from one's page (which are now being <br>
hunt for by robots) one might be tempted to abstain from posting altogether, <br>
(especially from newsgroups) but this is certainly not a constructive <br>
solution.<br>
<p>
What to do?<br>
<p>
Of course, one might create two accounts, one public, merely for posting, <br>
incoming mail being sent to /dev/null by default and a secret one for truly <br>
private communication, but this is also messy.<br>
<p>
A simple solution for protecting mailing list participants might be by <br>
morphing a list sever and an anonymous remailer together. At subscription <br>
time, each subscriber is allocated a list-local alias. Each incoming <br>
poster's address is substituted by an alias automagically. Mail from <br>
non-subscribes goes directly to /dev/null. This also handles mail header <br>
forging, since no one (but the list server) actually knows the nonalias mail <br>
address, thus being forced to regress to mere guessing.<br>
<p>
Is there a hole in the scheme?<br>
<p>
Another thing which worries me is that subject keywords are voluntary. If <br>
we'd all be using emacs, a script could be written which demands a <br>
selection from a pop-up list, but I guess this is just wishful thinking. <br>
Anyway, a _limited_ (new keywords created by voting) keyword token list <br>
would be very nice for a future mailer to have.<br>
<p>
