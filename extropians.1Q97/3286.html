<i>&gt;Perhaps the trait came about from periods of boom and bust in the</i><br>

<p>
The problem is that the same trade-off applies to both poor and rich<br>
families.  More children, given the same health, gives a greater probablity<br>
of surviving offspring.  Better health, given the same number of children,<br>
also gives a greater probability of surving offspring.  Choosing between<br>
quantity and quality of offspring is thus a classic economic choice between<br>
two goods with a limited budget.<br>
<p>
The normal outcome if you have to choose amounts of two good things when your<br>
budget (here wealth) increases is to get more of *both*.  Hence you would<br>
expect wealthier families to choose to have more kids *and* invest more in<br>
the kids they have.  The number of kids will go up more slowly than the<br>
wealth, as each kids is getting more resources, but it will still increase.<br>
 This is indeed how animals respond to increased resources, insofar as they<br>
have control over the quantity and quality of offspring, and it was also the<br>
situation in early modern (pre-industrial) Europe.  It's conventional wisdom<br>
that this situation applies to most other pre-industrial societies.<br>
<p>
The puzzle is why this outcome does not apply to industrial societies.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I think there is some complexity to the relation between<br>
industrial-era wealth and population growth.  England was by far the most<br>
advanced country from the 1600's almost up to WWI by a plethora of economic<br>
measures (per capita income, per capita industrial production, date of first<br>
freedom from famine, etc.)  But the first country to undergo the demographic<br>
transition (smaller families for the wealthy and voluntarily falling<br>
birthrates) was France.<br>
<p>
I believe the cause of falling birthrates is genetic, but memetic.  A<br>
fundamental characteristic of modern society that is not characteristic of<br>
any prior society is "too much interesting to do".  I think memes are<br>
evolving to take advantage of us by being so interesting and fun that we want<br>
to spend our time enjoying (and spreading) them rather than having children.<br>
