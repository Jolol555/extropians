<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure about it's uses as a mode of power transmission, but HAARP</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology may </i><br>
<i>&gt; be a route to weather control. With a few major breakthoughs in power</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplification, we might see some small effects such as screwing with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; local climate. The DoD has openly admitted that they're pumping dough into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the area of weather control which explains why they have their mitts it</i><br>
<i>&gt; HAARP.</i><br>
<p>
No. First, HAARP affects the ionosphere.  The ionosphere<br>
has no direct effect on the weather.  Second, the energy being put <br>
into the ionosphere by the Sun is very much larger than would be<br>
practical for humanity to inject.<br>
<p>
The HAARP site has this to say about weather modification:<br>
<p>
(from <a href="http://server5550.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects/haarp/faq.html">http://server5550.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects/haarp/faq.html</a> )<br>
<p>
-------<br>
<p>
Is HAARP capable of affecting the weather?<br>
<p>
The HAARP facility will not affect the stratosphere and climate. <br>
Transmitted energy in the frequency ranges that will be used<br>
by HAARP, is subject to negligible absorption in either the <br>
troposphere or the stratosphere - the two levels of the atmosphere<br>
which produce the earth's weather. Electromagnetic interactions<br>
only occur in the rarefied region above about 70 km known as<br>
the ionosphere.<br>
<p>
The ionosphere is created and continuously replenished as the<br>
sun's radiation interacts with the highest levels of the Earth's<br>
atmosphere. The downward coupling from the ionosphere to the<br>
stratosphere/troposphere is extremely weak, and no association<br>
between natural ionospheric variability and surface weather and<br>
climate has been found, even at the extraordinarily high levels of<br>
ionospheric turbulence that the sun can produce during a geomagnetic<br>
storm. If the ionospheric storms caused by the sun itself don't <br>
affect the surface weather, there is no chance that HAARP can do<br>
so either. <br>
