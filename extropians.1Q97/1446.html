<i>&gt;Humanity could generate more geniuses if we made sure all teachers are "nice".</i><br>
<p>
If I had liked my teachers enough to talk to them I might have learned more.<br>
Parents should be taught how to be teachers.<br>
I might have liked mine more.<br>
I learned more before I before I was in school than during.<br>
I think it makes more sense to learn while your brain is forming.<br>
I would enjoy life much more if I was taught by transhumansts/extropians.<br>
Who opened up my mind to it's potential?<br>
<p>
Mitch Porter did.<br>
Anders Sandburg did.<br>
Eric Forste did.<br>
Joe Strout did.<br>
Ralph Merkle did.<br>
<p>
Einstein did not.<br>
Newton did not.<br>
Plato did not.<br>
Socrates did not.<br>
Edison did not.<br>
<p>
All those people that did not are dead.<br>
Unless you start impressing me you might end up dead too. :-)<br>
