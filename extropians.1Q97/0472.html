Unlikely. When L5 colonies were more popular some studies were made of<br>
the costs<br>
of moving to the American colonies in the 1600s. It turned out the cost<br>
for an<br>
individual was about that of a house in the Midwest ($60,000 in todays<br>
money),<br>
which could be paid off in 5-10 years of work. The contract was called<br>
indentured<br>
labor. Unfortunately the cost of moving to a L5 colony was about 100x<br>
this<br>
number and therefore not economically feasible. <br>
<p>
AFAIK, every job training program for welfare has essentially failed,<br>
both due<br>
to the lack of jobs for the trainees and the wothlessness of the skills<br>
being<br>
trained for.<br>
