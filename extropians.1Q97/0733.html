One method of spreading the transhumanist memes that I would add to <br>
J. D Lyser's list is to provide an example through the ways in which <br>
we live and interact with others.  People quite naturally ask <br>
themselves, 'what is so special about transhumanists?  why should I <br>
listen to what they have to say?'  <br>
<p>
Within my own ethical paradigm, that means striving to treat everyone <br>
with tolerance and respect but also being willing to express timely <br>
outrage at harmful actions or attitudes directed at others.  It means <br>
speaking up for more productive modes of thinking and acting when others <br>
are sitting around needlessly complaining.  It means making a commitment <br>
to encourage or aid someone struggling to overcome an obstacle.  It also<br>
means regularly engaging in rigorous self-examination of my actions <br>
and motivations.  <br>
<p>
I have noticed a few changes amongst my circle of friends after a few <br>
years of being exposed to positive transhumanist modes of thinking <br>
and acting.  Their tolerance for negativity and useless bickering has <br>
declined, we talk more about plans and dreams for the future, and they <br>
have become more proactive about seeking out other positive individuals <br>
for purposes of dating or friendship.  I have also noticed the quiet <br>
movement from shelf to shelf of certain books and back copies of Extropy.<br>
