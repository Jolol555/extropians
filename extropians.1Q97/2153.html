From: Jim Legg <br>
<i>&gt;#3 Given there are a finite nuber of people on this planet, each with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;finite number of hours in the day to do work, and with a finite level</i><br>
<i>&gt;of  skills, as well as with a finite amount of resources to apply those</i><br>
<i>&gt;skills and hours to to increase or add value, it is obvious that there</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be a finite source of money.</i><br>
<p>
That's not at all obvious. You forget to take a lot of things into acount:<br>
Better tools, new inventions, effectivisation because of technological<br>
progress...<br>
<p>
You are conforming into traditional economic reasoning. Try studying a bit<br>
more about positive sum economy.<br>
