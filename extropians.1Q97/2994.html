Dear Max More,<br>
<p>
Congratulations on your upcoming interview!<br>
<p>
My suggestion re: extropian ideas is fairly simple.  <br>
<p>
If the concept or application of cryonic suspension comes up, (or if you<br>
*cause* it to come up) please stress that this IS an AFFORDABLE option for<br>
people.<br>
<p>
Through funding their suspension with life insurance, a person age "thirty<br>
something" can get coverage in place for less than a dollar a day.  People<br>
spend this on cigarettes!<br>
<p>
A individual age "forty, fifty, or sixty something" can still get a<br>
permanent, universal life coverage for 1 to 3 dollars a day.  <br>
<p>
Having been signed up with ALCOR for several years, and being in the<br>
financial planning and insurance business for 18 years,  I firmly believe at<br>
least *one* of the reasons more folks are not yet "signed up" for the cryonic<br>
suspension option is that they do not realize how INEXPENSIVE this option can<br>
be.<br>
<p>
I know there are philisophical / religious objections, etc. re: cryonics.<br>
<p>
But show someone they have a *chance* to be immortal for a really small and<br>
VERY "doable" amount of money, and I think we will have a lot more people<br>
thinking like extropians!<br>
<p>
I have admired your writings for years.  Congratulations also on your Ph D.,<br>
which I guess you have had for some time now. <br>
<p>
Upward and Outward,<br>
