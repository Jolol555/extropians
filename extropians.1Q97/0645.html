<p>
There has been a lot of discussion on the list over the years on various<br>
technologies that purport to improve minds: various flashing light<br>
devices, languages such as Loglan and E-Prime, "smart drugs" as well as<br>
the good old-fashioned kind.<br>
<p>
More recently we have seen Eliezer discuss the prospects for surgically<br>
or chemically altering growing children in order to promote certain<br>
mental abilities (at the expense of others), and David Musick talk about<br>
how his mental disciplines have greatly increased his sense of his own<br>
intelligence (apologies for the over-simplifications here; list members<br>
have access to the original writings).<br>
<p>
But I am skeptical about much of this.  There is not much in the way of<br>
concrete evidence that many of these technologies will work.  The lights<br>
and language seem flaky to me; the smart drugs may have some effects, but<br>
in many cases they seem to largely increase alertness, just like caffeine.<br>
<p>
As for self-reported perceptions, while obviously Eliezer and David are<br>
very intelligent, it's not clear what conclusions we can draw from that in<br>
terms of what other people could do to become smarter.  Self perceptions<br>
can be unreliable.  The fact that Eliezer has many cognitive strengths<br>
and some possible weaknesses doesn't prove much, he could simply be a<br>
more extreme case of the multi-factor IQ model which has been discussed<br>
in the literature for years.  And David's claims of having increased<br>
his intelligence are hard to evaluate without knowing more about what he<br>
was like when he was younger.  Maybe he's always been a very smart person.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The rest are talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt;rockets, cryonics, nanotechnology, thinking faster (but not better), and</i><br>
<i>&gt;uploading... only to download into a physically omnipotent body and</i><br>
<i>&gt;explore the Universe. </i><br>
<p>
These technologies are interesting in their own right.  And in some ways<br>
they seem more plausible, more certain, than hopes for truly increased<br>
intelligence (as compared to sped-up brains).  The only really reliable<br>
ways I can see to increase overall intelligence would be to clone<br>
(genetically or physically) very smart people, or to use some kind of<br>
adaptive process to evolve super smart AI's.  Trying to do it the old<br>
fashioned way, by coming up with an understanding of how the brain<br>
works and deducing what must be done to it to make it smarter, is an<br>
uncertain process.  It may be very difficult for the brain to understand<br>
itself that well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Extropians as a group still retain that</i><br>
<i>&gt;old-fashioned worldview that says that the Universe is out there, that</i><br>
<i>&gt;we must go and subdue it, and that we do this with lightsails and Von</i><br>
<i>&gt;Neumann machines and the accouterments of physical power.</i><br>
<p>
I think much of our discussion along these lines has been speculation<br>
about the ultimate relationship of life and the universe.  Even granted<br>
that we cannot understand the motivations of the actors, if we assume<br>
that they are constrained by physical laws as we best understand them,<br>
can we still draw conclusions about what will happen?  I have been<br>
very impressed by the quality of the discussion on these subjects.<br>
