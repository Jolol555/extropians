Neither one is trying to throw accurately.  The math involved is very<br>
simple.  Calvin's best on this subject, Ascent of Mind, is out of print,<br>
but available on his web site:<br>

<p>
Here is a (I hope fair use) clip from the table of contents:<br>
<p>
7 WHIDBEY ISLAND: Ratcheting Up Brain Size_ Parts, Process, Product:  the<br>
legislative process illustrates a transformational process at work, and<br>
illustrates what a detailed understanding of human evolutionary processes<br>
might involve. Beach walk to an old Indian fishing village buried by a mud<br>
slide on Whidbey Island. And a mother-and-unborn-child burial. Relatively big<br>
heads occur with early puberty. Then stature re-enlarges in other ways. When<br>
the resulting big heads kill their mothers, there is selection for<br>
slower-than-average body growth rates, so the survivors are born<br>
premature-looking. Given selection pressure resulting in juvenilization, one<br>
gets a cycle that can be repeated many times to enlarge the brain fourfold. <br>
<p>
_8 HAND-AX HEAVEN: The Ambitious Ape's Guide to a Bigger Brain_ 205 A<br>
possible advantage of juvenilized bodies for throwing ability and thus<br>
hunting. How an ape could have invented the predatory throw, using<br>
side-of-the-barn accuracy. And how it ought to lead to something like the<br>
Acheulean hand ax. A heaven for used hand axes, in the Pluvial ponds of the<br>
Sahara. The growth curve for throwing, and the brain reorganization it<br>
demands. <br>
<p>
If this is not applicable to the recent discussions, I don't know what<br>
might be.  Keith Henson<br>
