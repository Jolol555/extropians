Michael, Paul has it right.  It is *possible* to transfer power using<br>
electromagnetic waves, that was what the entire space colony/ solar power<br>
satellite was based on.  But what Tesla proposed makes no sense (given<br>
current understanding of physics) if for no other reason than the<br>
inefficiencies involved. (Square law, folks.)<br>
<p>
And, harmonizing is what a barbershop quartet does, the word in this<br>
context is no more meaningful than harmonizing with rock.  I speak both as<br>
a Tesla fan, who built a Tesla coil (radio frequency ~800kHz) which<br>
generated yard long sparks as a teenager, and an electrical engineer who<br>
knows a lot about power engineering and RF power. <br>
