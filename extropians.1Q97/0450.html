In a message dated 97-01-09 08:28:57 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; A true alien might not fit our detectors, and look so utterly different <br>
 that we will not immediately have a reaction. Imagine something that <br>
 looks like a glittering cloud with fractal shells - it is too weird <br>
 to mean anything to us. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This does bring up a puzzle which has confounded me since I was a tiny child:<br>
how will we acknoledge, or WILL we acknowledge some life or Alife ( in outer<br>
space) that is not biological?<br>
It has always seemed obvious to me that our narrow definition of life is<br>
hardly the criteria for such a vast place as the universe.<br>
If such a thing exists we are not seeking it on other planets. We are still<br>
 looking for lichen and bacteria? Gas and crystals - or whatever,  even if<br>
conscious ,and commucative, would be utterly ignored by our probes.<br>
