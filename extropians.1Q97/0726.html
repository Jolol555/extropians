I think you misjudge sensor technology.  Military IR sensor satellites in<br>
geosync orbit (~40000 km) can detect fractional degree changes at<br>
resolutions of something like 10 meters on the planet surface.  Some of the<br>
new generation sensor platforms have much improved capabilities over even<br>
that.  Also, decent signal processing will be able to pick out small, weak,<br>
differential IR sources against the backdrop of a spinning earth, since its<br>
behavior would distinguish itself from an earth based IR sources.<br>

I am not aware of any EMP studies on superconductors.  Obviously, they could<br>
handle EMP up to a certain point without a problem due to their<br>
superconducting nature, but superconductors do have flux load limits.  They<br>
would certainly offer more protection than ordinary conductors, especially<br>
if you are using the supercooled ceramic type superconductors.  My<br>
(unqualified) theory is that when you have a flux overload, the<br>
superconductor would start to heat up.  At a certain temperature point, it<br>
would resume an entirely ceramic nature, which would then be unaffected by<br>
EMP.  If this was the case, EMP might be more of a nuisance than a threat.<br>
But I am not qualified to make any kind of definitive judgement on this.<br>
