<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Onward!</i><br>
<p>
I will attempt a summation then. Thank you for taking the time to delve<br>
into this issue with me. As is so often the case, one of our<br>
difficulties in this discussion has been a discrepancy in our<br>
definitions of common words, the word "truth" in particular. I was<br>
thinking of truth as an absolute in a purely dichotomous sense while you<br>
treating it as a something contextual, something that could be achieved<br>
in degrees. <br>
<p>
What you have called truth in the contextual sense, I call for lack of<br>
better words, functional. I do this in order to distinguish the absolute<br>
from that which can be attained by degree. What you would call true I<br>
would call functional or useful. I believe this is a subtle<br>
philosophical shift. It attentuates the epistemological priority of<br>
knowledge while enhancing the axiological priority of emotion qua<br>
need/desire. This shift occurs because knowledge is concerned with truth<br>
[and thus purely cognitive], while need and desire are more concerned<br>
with functionality [and thus gratification].Perhaps this is an<br>
irrelevant or irrational distinction. So far I can only offer intuitive<br>
reasons for this differentiation and correlating priority shift. <br>
<p>
<p>
Reasons for shift:<br>
<p>
1. Increase our sensitivity to our emotions qua need and desire, thus<br>
enabling us to become more aware or more "knowlegeable" of our needs and<br>
desires. By this I mean, that most of our desires are formed<br>
subconsciously. Desires which are formed subconsciously cannot be<br>
checked rationally, and the more that is determined subconsciously the<br>
less freedom we have by degree. So in attempting to make conscious what<br>
has hitherto been subconscious, we can learn to take responsibility for<br>
it. We cannot take responsibility [at least not yet] for something that<br>
is determined subconsciously. We have no control over it.     <br>
  <br>
2. Increase our maturity, our rational control over our emotions, so<br>
that we can effectively deal with the enormous amount "knowledge" we are<br>
collecting via our intensive cognitive educations. For this I propose an<br>
equally intensive emotive education in our public and private schools.<br>
This would begin in the first grade. Most schools do not even teach<br>
psychology until high school, some that I know of only allow the juniors<br>
and seniors to enroll in these courses. No school that I am aware of<br>
teaches a true emotive education. Its difficult to conceive of at first.<br>
How do you *test* a student's ability to delve into the subconscious?<br>
How do you test their ability to make conscious what is subconscious.<br>
How do you objectively test something so seemingly subjective? There are<br>
methods however, and those methods will continue to develop.<br>
	I believe violence in general, and specifically science for the purpose<br>
of violence would be greatly reduced if we included emotive education in<br>
our schools.  <br>
 <br>
3. Enhance our ability to direct science. Science is a tool first and<br>
foremost. Perhaps the meta or general purpose [desire] for the tool of<br>
science is to achieve truth. Regardless, in particular, we seek specific<br>
things we wish to enable via science, e.g. immortality. If we become<br>
more "knowledgeable" and aware of our emotions, and what is going on<br>
subconsciously, then we will have more control over the direction that<br>
science moves in. Right now, science is in much part directed by<br>
subconcsious forces [desires] that we are not in touch with. Thus the<br>
direction that science is moving in is more determined than it need be.<br>
Perhaps I might call this a desire for scientific freedom. There are<br>
many arguments stating that we are wholly determined, but those<br>
arguments only stand as long as their is a clear distinction between<br>
freedom and determinism, and just as you pointed out the degrees of<br>
truth, there are certainly degrees of freedom.     <br>
<p>
4. Enhance ectstasy. For me, ecstasy qua self-epiphany is the climax of<br>
being. It is what makes life worth living. An emotive education would<br>
aid people in fostering ecstasy ... it would help attentuate social<br>
taboos of self-gratification. Ecstasy can be achieved through pure<br>
emotion, intuition [eureka!], and even cognition, but a sensibility of<br>
the emotions is a must if one wishes to attain ecstasy on a regular<br>
basis rather than at few random times in life.<br>
<p>
5. Better control over our modalities of consciousness. Our emotions<br>
effect our centreal nervous system (CNS) and vice versa. If we learn to<br>
control our emotions as connoisseurs of consciousness, then we can<br>
sustain modes of consciousness such as rationality and ecstasty for<br>
extended periods of time. Just as conflicting emotions often combine to<br>
create new emotions, perhaps we will discover new modes of rationality<br>
when such modes dynamically clash in the same moment with some form of<br>
ecstasy.<br>
<p>
6. With a much better first hand understanding of our emotions and<br>
endogenous realities I believe that we will have a much greater chance<br>
at creating a truely profound AI.<br>
<p>
7. Greater maturity for the coming dissolving of governement. It might<br>
not be the best word to use, anarchy, but I believe that it is in a<br>
sense where Libertarianism is leading us ... just in a sense perhaps,<br>
but in any fashion, Libertarianism requires that we take responsibility<br>
from the governement and claim those responsibilities for ourselves. In<br>
a psuedo-anarchic system we will need to have learned a great deal more<br>
about our emotions and how to effectively employ them before we can<br>
imagine such a system to remain orderly. I know this is open to<br>
argument, and thats not what I am seeking here, but I think you might be<br>
able to entertain my perspective for a moment.<br>
<p>
8. Fostering genius in our youth. Genius is something much more than<br>
cognitive skill. Genius requires an enhanced emotive and intuitive<br>
sensibility. We do not foster genious in our schools because we do not<br>
foster these latter sensibilities. We shove knowledge down the throats<br>
of our youth without teaching them how to teach themselves. Intelligence<br>
is much more than being able to recite facts. Intelligence requires the<br>
ability to think in new and novel ways, which requires a sensibility to<br>
emotion and intuition.<br>
<p>
9. Lastly, it is perhaps possible that a new assimilation of reason and<br>
emotion might be the very thing necessary to begin something<br>
transcendental of science and to thus set off the hypothetical<br>
singularity.<br>
 <br>

<p>
I agree entirely. I was not attempting to claim that the emotions should<br>
be employed without reason. I believe I was quite clear in stating that<br>
I wished to see the two used together, which you have now clarified to<br>
me that you have no problem with.  <br>
<p>
I'm not sure if I have convinced you of the importance of including<br>
emotive concepts in a system such as extropy or not, and I'm not sure if<br>
this is the time for you to reflect on it, but I would humbly suggest<br>
such in the future. Much of my confusion regarding your stand on emotive<br>
"intelligence" could have been reduced if there were some extropian<br>
documents which made an honest effort to deal with this issue.  <br>
<p>
I believe I point this out in a similar fashion as "Mark Miller<br>
expressed his view that "epistemological issues are the great missing<br>
piece in Extropian philosophy right now."" I am expressing a view that <br>
emotive issues are now "the great missing piece in Extropian<br>
philosophy."<br>
<p>
I know you do not wish to debate this further, and I do not intend to<br>
... its just food for thought.<br>
<p>
Good luck on the book Max,<br>
