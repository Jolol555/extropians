<p>
The point in giving computers emotions was explained in recent posts. We<br>
have been discussing the possability of uploading. Some of us here<br>
believe that if we were to be uploaded the computer we are uploaded to<br>
must be able to experience emotions in order for the uploading to be<br>
worth while. If we are to be uploaded we want to be able to experience<br>
emotions. Some do not agree with this. Some of us believe that in order<br>
for a computer to experience emotions that the computer's hardware must<br>
be designed for this purpose. Others here believe that any computer can<br>
be programmed by a sufficiently intelligent individual to experience<br>
emotions. <br>
