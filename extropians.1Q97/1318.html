<i>&gt; From: Damien Broderick &lt;damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A simple example (too smug, too hasty, I got it wrong): if ABC changes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ABD, what will MRRJJJ become?  What does XYZ turn into?  A smart program</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; named Copycat has provided a range of solutions.  Answers: since ABC maps to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 123, ABD equals 124; hence JJJ becomes JJJJ, yielding MRRJJJJ (not, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; MRRJJD or MRRKKK, let alone MRRKKKK).  And XYZ: XYZZ?  XYY?  XYA?  Maybe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But clever Copycat saw that A maps onto Z.  Running backwards, we get WYZ.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Elegant.  Is that artificial mind creative, or what?</i><br>
[Hal Finney:]<br>
<i>&gt; Douglas Hofstadter's group is doing this work, and his book from last year</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes into it in detail.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am skeptical about how well his results will generalize, although it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; an interesting class of problems.  I can guarantee you that Hofstadter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a very smart man, saw the answers to the problems above immediately.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact he and his students created the problems knowing they had these</i><br>
<i>&gt; clever answers.  So then the task they faced was how to write a program</i><br>
<i>&gt; which would get the same answers that they got.  That they were able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do so is very impressive.  But the question remains whether the data</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures they came up with are of general enough applicability that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they can shed light on other problems of AI.</i><br>
<p>
Speakin' as someone who looked at the source code, the data structures<br>
*look* general, but FARG needs a 'Cat that can *learn* symbols and<br>
group-types instead of havin' a preprogrammed "Slipnet" and<br>
"successor-groups" before the method used is really general.<br>
