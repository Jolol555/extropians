<p>
Ok, fine, but don't be surprised if you get the same in return.<br>
            <br>

<i>        &gt;There's nothing irrational about immutable laws of physics. Except         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Heisenberg's uncertainty principle  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is not irrational, it's just bizarre.  <br>
It's strange that there is a limit on how much knowledge we can have on the  <br>
position and momentum of something, and Heisenberg is far from the strangest <br>
aspect of Quantum Mechanics. Take the famous 2 slit experiment for example, <br>
shine a light on 2 closely spaced slits and it will produce a complex  <br>
interference pattern on a film, even if the photons are sent out one at a  <br>
time.  If a photon goes through one slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the <br>
other slit, the one it didn't go though, was there or not, but it does!<br>
<p>
Or place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and one set at <br>
90 degrees over the other, and the interference pattern disappears. Now place <br>
a third filter set at 45 degrees between the slits and the film. The <br>
interference pattern comes back! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does not <br>
enter in any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and we<br>
just don't know which one, it goes through both slits, and neither.<br>
            <br>

<i>        &gt;the element Silicon (Si), used as a semiconductor is not a compound,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;it is the element.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That is a gross oversimplification. In the first place the Silicon is not <br>
pure, it must be doped with small but very precise quantities of impurities  <br>
or it won't work. In the second place the same isotope of the same element  <br>
can have vastly different properties. Graphite, diamond and Bucky-Balls are   <br>
different allotropes of the exact same element, carbon.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you can't seriously think that in the future we're going to have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;silicon skin. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Actually I agree with that, we won't have silicon skin, neither will we have <br>
skin made of protein, we won't have skin.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the future's going to look alot like it looks now. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I profoundly disagree.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;5000 years ago, society had more in common with today's society than         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;it does different. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, both then and now we had to make use of the same ridiculous steam <br>
powered brain slapped together by mindless mutation and natural selection, <br>
fortunately times are changing and a new model is in the wings. A thousand <br>
years from now the Human Race will be as extinct as the Trilobite, probably <br>
less than a century, perhaps only a few decades.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The future is never alien. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The future is always alien, I don't even try to imagine what things will be <br>
like after the Singularity, I know it would be hopeless.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's blind theorizing like that which makes all future oriented         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;people look foolish. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That is an occupational hazard that we might as well get accustom to. Future <br>
oriented people ALWAYS look foolish to most, those who are correct look <br>
especially foolish.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if I shook your ivory towers at the root, too bad. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
My my, we do have large opinion of ourselves don't we. Are you really saying <br>
with a straight face that you think your silly little post shook us at the <br>
root?       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I say, WAKE UP! </i><br>
             <br>
<p>

<p>
<i>        &gt;With increased power comes increased responsibility. The price of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;liberty is constant vigilance.    </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
I can see you've been reading your 6'th grade civics book again.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Can I suggest you all go take a refresher course in chemistry and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;physics? </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Hey, don't tell me how smart you are, show me. Perhaps you do know more  <br>
chemistry and physics than I do, but I doubt it. I would love to go toe to toe <br>
with you on these subjects and have you prove me wrong, it would be a great <br>
education. How about it?<br>
