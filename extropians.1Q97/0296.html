PC? Disney? Geez, now I have heard everything. More likely some Bob Dole<br>
family value crap.<br>
<p>
Well,in any case, if you want realism, Chris,  that ride should have already<br>
OUTRAGED you -  Disney should also have put in real live rats, bloody<br>
eviscerations and beheadings, the true stench of  pirates, leprous diseases<br>
for you to take home with you, and real stinking corpses too!<br>
<p>
Come on, this is Disney we are talking about,  look at Poke-a-honky, the most<br>
disgusting misrepresentation of the English entering into native american<br>
life, and or ANY Disney schmaltz fest. <br>
