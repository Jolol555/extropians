Indeed.  When G. Boyajian and T. Lutz examined the fractal twistiness of<br>
ammonite sutures, often said to show increased elaboration with time, they<br>
found no historical bias toward complexity - and, what's more, no<br>
correlation between complexity and species longevity.   The argument seems<br>
solid.  It has little bearing, of course, on purely cultural change, which<br>
is why the Spike will be the product of memes - the `Lamarckian' units of<br>
human minds and passions - rather than the raw contest of genes.<br>
<p>
Stuart Kauffman, who represents the alternative point of view, insists that<br>
self-organisation is a hallmark of life in our universe.  For Kauffman, in<br>
AT HOME IN THE UNIVERSE, `the emerging sciences of complexity begin to<br>
suggest that the order is not accidental, that vast veins of spontaneous<br>
order lie at hand.'  If Gould insists that re-playing the tape of evolution<br>
from the start would not produce us humans, Kauffman can readily agree,<br>
while holding out for a different but related claim.  `The particular<br>
branchings of life... might differ, but the patterns of the branching... are<br>
likely to be lawful.'  And his conclusion sounds like the sort of mystical<br>
assurance Gould loathes: `I am heartened by a view of evolution as a<br>
marriage of spontaneous order and natural selection.  I am heartened by the<br>
possibility that organisms are not contraptions piled on contraptions all<br>
the way down, but expressions of a deeper order inherent in all life.'<br>
Nowhere in AT HOME or THE ORIGINS OF ORDER does Stu K. cite McShea's studies<br>
suggesting that the contrary is the case.  Funny, that.<br>
