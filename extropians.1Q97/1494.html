Von Neumann had little physical intuition, and even in pure mathematics was <br>
not as creative as Godel or Turing, but I don't know anyone in the entire <br>
history of Science who had a quicker mind of made fewer mathematical mistakes. <br>
Von Neumann never won a Nobel Prize, but more than one Nobel Prize winner <br>
with a boiling water IQ ( Hans Bethe, Eugene Wigner, even Richard Feynman) <br>
has publicly stated that in Von Neumann's presence they felt like morons. <br>
This despite the fact that Von Neumann always took great pains to be kind and <br>
exceedingly polite. The man was so smart it was terrifying, Feynman called <br>
him a  "monster mind".<br>

<i>        &gt;Victor J Stenger contradicts both Bell and Mermim (and presumably         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;work  </i><br>
               <br>

Bell said it was silly and irrelevant, he did not say it had a mathematical  <br>
error.<br>

Thank you, I rather liked it too.<br>

<i>        &gt;Cramer's transactional interpretation does not necessarily imply         </i><br>

If it's true then right now we are causing things to happen in the Vergo  <br>
cluster of galaxies before the Earth even existed. how could you get more  <br>
non-local than that?<br>
