A few months ago I got a one on one presentation from a neuroscientist<br>
(Dr. M. Kubek, Indiana U. Med. Center, Indianaoplis) <br>
working down the hall from my work-study job.  <br>
Here's a brief version of then peek he gave <br>
me of <br>
his successes with inhibiting seizures in rats.  It just dawned on me <br>
today that his technique could be modified to give a constant, <br>
consistant, and localized dose of, say, dopamine or {insert favorite <br>
nootropic chemical}. <br>
<p>
The brains of a group of rats were conditioned to have siezures at the<br>
prompting of a specific stimulus.  After conditioning, a portion of those <br>
rats had a "micro disc" (I believe that's what he called it) implanted in <br>
their brains at a site known to be envolved in a particular kind of <br>
siezure.  This micro disc is a small soluble, ...um... thing, that <br>
releases a chemical that naturally occurs in human <br>
brains as well as rats.  This chemical is known to inhibit siezures in <br>
both rats and humans.  When exposed to the stimulus, the rats without the <br>
micro disc showed no change in their response to the stimulus, while <br>
those with the implant showed a clear decline in brain activity <br>
associated with siezures.  <br>
	I'm sorry about the missing details and any slight <br>
misrepresentaions of exactly what the experiment entailed, but the result <br>
of the experiment is clear; The microdisc Dr. Kubek used in this <br>
experiment delivers a constant, consistant supply of chemical to a <br>
localized region of the brain.  He went on to explain that humans with <br>
severe forms of epilepsy could have a permanent window in the skull <br>
through which a new micro disc could be installed on an out patient basis <br>
every few months or so when the previous disc had disolved.  This is an <br>
alternative treatment to i.v. injenctions, or in some cases, a <br>
frontal lobotomy.<br>
	Such a drug delivery system could be used for extropic purposes <br>
(and, of cours, involuntary mind control), however drilling a hole in a <br>
perfectly good skull is not something I'd just jump into.  If the above <br>
method is not suitable, maybe it can be a starting point for one that is.<br>
	This work is not yet published, though it was presented to a <br>
neuroscience conference in Washington D.C. around Nov. '96.  I'd be <br>
willing to find out when and where it will be published for an interested <br>
party.<br>
<p>
	Please pardon any awkward sentences.  Pine does not allow me much <br>
latitude for editing.<br>
<p>
Exovivo!<br>
