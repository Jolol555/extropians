Lyle,<br>
<p>
Thanks for the constructive criticism, so let's see if I can <br>
answer the points you brought up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Coordinate space?  How 'bout coordinate system?  Do you really want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to put the coordinate systems themselves into a space of their own?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe, maybe not, I really don't know what would be the right way to<br>
frame the semantics on this.  I don't want to misuse existing jargon,<br>
but on the other hand what I am describing has a very definite meaning<br>
which, to say the least, is not widely recognized.<br>
<p>
Worse yet, what I'm describing is "intuitively" known in a very poorly<br>
defined way within our culture, leading to a constant confusion between<br>
the perspectives from which a truth may or may not be able to be beheld,<br>
and the actual truth (or lack thereof) itself.  This is an attempt to<br>
define in a more precise way this distinction between truth and perspec-<br>
tive and to ground that distinction in solid mathematical principles.<br>
<p>
In any case physicists themselves have also set a precedent in this <br>
by calling momentum space just that, a space.  I strongly feel that<br>
on this tangent we have a case of physicists not taking their own<br>
theories and descriptions seriously enough.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In math these are the spaces that are defined by the myriad Fourier</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; waveform families.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do waveforms come in families?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and the families can be totally arbitrary as Nick Herbert describes<br>
in pages 82-89 of his book _Quantum Reality_.  The impulse and sine wave<br>
families of classical Fourier analysis are simply those waves that are<br>
kin and conjugate to the Cartesian aspect of reality that we are localized<br>
within.  An infinite number of families are possible, even if only these<br>
two conjugate families seem to be needed for basic Fourier analyis.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; For those into music, this leads into the distinctions between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; relative ease or difficulty that analog and digital synthesizers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in reproducing certain forms of music.  For those in physics, this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the mathematical basis for Heisenberg uncertainty.  But in both cases,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we are looking at a basic mathematical principle manifesting itself</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in our reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm...</i><br>
<p>
Interesting isn't it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is also the reason why computers are such idiot savants,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they are hard-wired to the Fourier space defined by their RAM's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; linear address space.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now wait a minute.  First of all, non-mathematical readers should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; warned that "Fourier space" is not a standard mathematical concept.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Apparently it was freshly minted for the occasion, like my "deity space"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a few weeks ago.</i><br>
<p>
This is very true, "Fourier space" is a freshly minted term, I could have<br>
made that more clear in my initial post on this.  Going back to your <br>
original question, about calling it a space, the Cartesian coordinate<br>
system very clearly defines what we ordinary think of as a space; the<br>
space known more formally in mathematics as the Euclidean space.<br>
<p>
Now higher level spaces (like the Hilbert space) do exist in mathematics,<br>
but the problem is that unless we generalize our concept of what a<br>
space is at this lower level we automatically assume that the Euclidean<br>
space has an ontological reality greater than it actually does; thus I<br>
coined the brand new phase "Fourier-space" to reveal how much our fam-<br>
iliar Euclidean space is just an ultimately arbitrary perspective upon<br>
a more general reality no matter how important it is to us locally. <br>
Again, I strongly feel that this arbitrary perspective is the reason<br>
why QM seems so mysterious in general.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  One applies a Fourier transform to a function to</i><br>
<i>&gt; yield another function.  The functions themselves live in a space called a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hilbert space.</i><br>
<p>
I certainly slipped a cog when writing this by forgetting that a gen-<br>
eralized set of these Fourier spaces is called a Hilbert space.  It's<br>
amazing how I can get so focused on one line of thought that I start<br>
forgetting stuff like this.  It's also true that some mathematical <br>
techniques especially in the area of matrix math actually deal with <br>
this beast in a systematic way.  Unfortunately, I've never heard of <br>
any metaphor that even comes close to allowing us to picture Hilbert<br>
space.  Any one got any ideas?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You seem to be saying that functions can be separated into equivalence</i><br>
<i>&gt; classes.  The functions in one equivalence class (or "Fourier space" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "waveform family") are interconvertible with other functions in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same class, but not with the functions in other classes.  This is news to</i><br>
<i>&gt; me.  (Which doesn't mean you're wrong; a lot of things are news to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I think some explanation is called for.) </i><br>
<p>
This is not my meaning.  It's very clear that functions can arbitrarily<br>
be moved from one Fourier space to another, IF one is willing to use an<br>
infinite number of terms.  A quick review of what I actually said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; While Godel defined one form of incompleteness, there is another form that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is equally significant, and that is the incompleteness of one coordinate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; space for defining in a simple form all possible localizations and cor-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; relations that can exist within mathematical reality.</i><br>
<p>
This is the main point.  The functions might well be totally equivalent, <br>
but no finite brain is going to solve the problem if it is trying to define<br>
a function in a Fourier-space that requires a near infinite number of terms<br>
to approximate that function well.  What we have here is a very fundamental <br>
issue regarding the usability of information as a "function" of which <br>
Fourier-space that infomation is being represented in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any function that satisfies</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Dirichlet conditions (piecewise continuous and square-integrable)</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be Fourier-transformed.  Nicht wahr?  And the same sines and</i><br>
<i>&gt; cosines are used for all functions...  so where do the equivalence classes</i><br>
<i>&gt; come from?</i><br>
<p>
Thus this is a non-issue as my point is not that they can't be<br>
transformed, so much as how many terms will be necessary to effect<br>
an accurate transformation.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As for computers being "hard-wired to the Fourier space defined by</i><br>
<i>&gt; their RAM's linear address space" -- I have no idea what this means.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Software can work around this to some extent, but without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; special hardware, no computer is ever going to operate as efficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in other Fourier spaces as the default one defined by its hardware.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All computers are mathematically equivalent, aren't they?</i><br>
<i>&gt; One Turing machine can do anything another Turing machine can do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you referring to the fact that different chips have different</i><br>
<i>&gt; instruction sets?  What does this have to do with Fourier analysis?</i><br>
<p>
IMO, it is simply an error to extend the Turing theorem across the <br>
boundaries of Fourier-spaces.  A high precision tunable multi-channel<br>
analog processing unit attached to a Apple II with an appropriate<br>
digital to analog control interface, and a fast latching analog to <br>
digital data readback interface could easily solve in seconds certain <br>
classes of problems that would give a Cray indigestion for hours at a<br>
time.  Analog computers might be out of fashion for a number of reasons,<br>
but they are immensely powerful in their native realm.  The problem<br>
with "general purpose Turing machines" is that there will always be<br>
classes of problems that any given class of machines will choke on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The human brain is so flexible because it contains the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; look at things from radically different viewpoints.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, the essential thing is that the human brain can look at things</i><br>
<i>&gt; from a viewpoint.  Computers are idiot savants because they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; no viewpoint.  They have no general model of the world.  They have</i><br>
<i>&gt; no organs of perception, and no language (in the human sense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "language" -- C and Java are not languages in the sense that English</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Sanskrit are languages).</i><br>
<p>
I agree totally, I never meant my assessment of what contributes to<br>
the "idiot savant" nature of computers to be exhaustive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nevertheless, in spite of all this criticism, I think you are onto</i><br>
<i>&gt; something.  On an intuitive level, I think I see what you are getting at.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure the concept of "Fourier space" can be made rigorous,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but it is a thought-provoking idea.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I wouldn't expect that, in the limited sense of showing that <br>
differing Fourier spaces can hold different patterns of information<br>
with varying degrees of ease and localization, there would be any<br>
problem with making this rigorous.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The essential ideas of Fourier analysis are</i><br>
<i>&gt; (1) Analyzing something into its components.  A function is the sum of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a series of sines and cosines.  This is analogous to saying that a point</i><br>
<i>&gt; (x,y,z) in 3-space is the sum of (x,0,0) + (0,y,0) + (0,0,z).  Functions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, require an infinite number of "coordinates".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (2)  Duality.  Given a function of time, one applies a Fourier transform</i><br>
<i>&gt; to obtain a function of frequency;  then one applies a transform to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; function, and the result is... the same function of time that we started</i><br>
<i>&gt; with.  Thus, functions come in Fourier pairs.  Alternatively, we can say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the "same" function exists in the time domain and in the frequency</i><br>
<i>&gt; domain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, the instruction set of a chip could be viewed as the "coordinates"</i><br>
<i>&gt; with which the chip represents problems, and the "Fourier space" would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the set of programs that can be (simply or efficiently) written using</i><br>
<i>&gt; this instruction set -- is that what you mean when you say a computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; is "hard-wired to a Fourier space"?  If so, I think it's confusing to bring</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fourier analysis into it.</i><br>
<p>
This is not my meaning.  It's not just simply an instruction set issue, since<br>
by hardwired, I mean that the hardware would have built in analog frequency<br>
generators and analog computer logic.  It is my contention that if someone<br>
could solve the practical problems of fusing digital logic with analog logic<br>
into a seamless computational device then we would have machines that would<br>
be qualitatively more intelligent on a wide range of problems.<br>
<p>
Ultimately this would lead to a computer that could change, on the fly, the<br>
ratio of digital to analog in its computation so as to surf through the<br>
general set of Fourier spaces to find a concise representation of whatever<br>
problem is at hand.  A process that we might call meta-problem solving.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  3. FOURIER SPACES &amp; CULTURE:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unless a person is both able and willing to switch to a different</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Fourier space, they literally can not understand what the other person</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is talking about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In fact they not only will not be able to answer the questions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that are defined in that Fourier space, there's no guarantee that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be able to even grasp the question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok.  Now  your point is getting clearer.  You are conceiving language</i><br>
<i>&gt; as based on semantic primitives, or coordinates, and the "Fourier space"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is everything that can be (simply or efficiently) expressed using certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; coordinates, i.e. a person's basic vocabulary.  Again, I'm not sure that</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to base this whole discussion on sines and cosines is the best way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to proceed.</i><br>
<p>
My hypothesis is that the known physiology of the human brain is that of a <br>
combined digital and analog device as described above.  A combination that<br>
gives us much flexibility in viewpoint, but can also leave us to talking <br>
past each other if the people involved can't or won't match viewpoints. <br>
The relevance of Fourier spaces to this is that formally, this is what <br>
would be involved when describing the characteristics of this kind of <br>
digital/analog combination.<br>
