We'll never know, E., until you start adding attribution.  Is it a problem<br>

`What would happen, McCaskill had wondered, if one made a soup of Turing<br>
machines and let them collide; one collision partner would act as the<br>
machine, and the other partner in the collision would act as the input tape.<br>
The soup of programs would act on itself, rewriting each other's programs,<br>
until... Until what?<br>
<p>
`Well, it didn't work.  Many Turing machine programs are able to enter<br>
infnite loops and "hang".  In such a case, the collision partners become<br>
locked in a mutual embrace that never ends...  This attempt to create a<br>
silicon self-reproducing spaghetti of progams failed.  Oh well.'<br>
<p>
BTW, `sentience' is feeling, not intelligence, certainly not self-reflexive<br>
consciousness.  Poul Anderson long ago coined `sophonts' for what earlier sf<br>
writers called `sentients', but I don't know the adjective.<br>
