<i>&gt;&gt; Kathryn Aegis:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I have concluded that it is very difficult to discuss something this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; personal on a listserve, because one doesn't know the frame of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reference out of which someone interprets what one says.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Gregory Houston:</i><br>
<i>&gt; So in order to express and understand things this personal with another</i><br>
<i>&gt; person, we must understand where the other person is coming from ... we</i><br>
<i>&gt; must have an empathy for their framework of perception. And in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have such an empathy we must draw from similar personal experiences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I cannot share with someone, something they cannot recieve. If I were to</i><br>
<i>&gt; meet an alien, an entity who I have relatively little in common with,</i><br>
<i>&gt; our differences will make it nearly impossible for us to communicate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our encounter cannot be intimate and personal ... until we make a joint</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort to attune to each other, to by some degree become more like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other. We must find common ground, and then expand that ground of</i><br>
<i>&gt; similarity until we can communicate freely and personally...</i><br>
<p>
With any person on the planet, you have 1000 times more in common than<br>
different.  Even with an alien, the whole of objective reality--the<br>
entire universe--is common ground.  If you find it difficult to have<br>
meaningful conversations with others, then perhaps it is because you<br>
have failed to tie your thoughts to some objective reality that we all<br>
share.  This should be even easier with humans, because we share not<br>
only the external reality but also the physical and psychological<br>
nature of a single species among billions.  What minor differences of<br>
circumstance, attitude, culture, or state could possibly overwhelm<br>
common ground of that magnitude?<br>
<p>
If you choose to focus most of your attention on those minor differences,<br>
then your failure to communicate is not because of those differences--<br>
it is because you choose to focus on them.  What better way to expand<br>
your relationships with others than by dedicating your mind to the task<br>
of discovering what everyone shares--i.e., objective reality?<br>
