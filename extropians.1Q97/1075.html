On his infamous web page, Hugo de Garis writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the late 60s I found the feminist ideas incredibly exciting, </i><br>
<i>&gt; because I grew up in Australia, in the 50s and 60s, where </i><br>
<i>&gt; the women were suburban housewives and paralytically boring. </i><br>
<p>
Natasha V. More gives a perfect illustration of this, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Answer:  I would not live forever, because we should not </i><br>
<i>&gt; live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, </i><br>
<i>&gt; then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, </i><br>
<i>&gt; which is why I would not live forever.</i><br>
<i>&gt;             --  Miss Alabama, in the 1994 Miss Universe contest </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yep.  That's how it was, and apparently still is in some circles.  <br>
My anti-PC rants should not be taken as an endorsement of the <br>
good old days.  <br>
<p>
But wait a minute...  as I look over Miss Alabama's statement, <br>
I'm not sure it's as nonsensical as it first appears.  The impression of <br>
silliness is partly due to the repetitious run-on sentence structure.  <br>
Since this was an oral statement, let's give her the benefit of the doubt <br>
and rephrase it, putting in periods instead of commas, and deleting <br>
some of the repetition, so the structure of her argument is more <br>
apparent:    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would not live forever, because we shouldn't live forever.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Why shouldn't we?  Because --]  If we were supposed to </i><br>
<i>&gt; live forever, then we would, but in fact we can't.  Therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt; we aren't supposed to.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Conclusion]  That's why I wouldn't live forever.  </i><br>
<p>
Stated that way, her argument isn't so silly.  What she is really trying <br>
to say is:  "It is impossible to accept the premise of the question, <br>
i.e. that we could live forever but don't.  We can't live forever.  <br>
Therefore we aren't supposed to live forever, so I wouldn't want <br>
to try."  This is actually a subtle and interesting point.  She doesn't <br>
have enough experience with argumentation to get this idea across, <br>
but she is at least trying to be logical.  <br>
<p>
Consider the situation:  (1) She's not a law student to begin with -- <br>
thinking in paragraphs is not something she has trained herself to do. <br>
(2) She's nervous, and this question is sprung on her out of the blue -- <br>
this isn't the kind of question she expected to be asked.  Given that, <br>
I think her inarticulate reply is understandable.  <br>
<p>
