Reilly,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; David Wick's survey of the theories and their conceptual development in</i><br>
<i>&gt; these areas is good ("The Infamous Boundary" (1996)).  He seems to struggle</i><br>
<i>&gt; a bit over the shape of better theories, especially whether it is better</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the theories to violate active vs. passive locality as long as they</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a well-defined notion of outcomes, but in the end he says: "The last</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility, and clearly the correct one, is that there is some totally new</i><br>
<i>&gt; way of looking at Nature."  Isn't this always true?</i><br>
<p>
Seems like I answered this in advance in my other post.  Funny how<br>
metaphysics always keeps coming back from the dead no matter how many<br>
times human culture tries to drive a stake through its heart.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;In the formal interpretation, these backward in time answers also carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative energy, and so nothing really weird comes from it except for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; clarity that 50% of all microcausality is happening as a result of advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; action.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I realize that discrete models of microcausality have been proposed for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple hundred years, and have been repeatedly rejected in favor of</i><br>
<i>&gt; indiscrete models by the scientific community.  However, I believe that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; discrete model will eventually prevail in explanatory power.</i><br>
<p>
Discrete or not, unless someone can get rid of that second order differential<br>
equation, we seem stuck with this 50% backward in time causality in any case.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Feynman hinted at such a possibility in "QED": "It's surprising that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; [QED] theory still hasn't been proved self-consistent one way or the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; by now....  What is certain is that we do not have a good mathematical way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to describe the theory of QED....  Another way of describing this</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty is to say that perhaps the idea that two points can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinitely close together is wrong ­ the assumption that we can use</i><br>
<i>&gt; geometry down to the last notch is false."</i><br>
<p>
I highly suspect that the failure of the geometrical approach is directly<br>
related to this problem of Fourier spaces as the Heisenberg uncertainty <br>
which lies at the heart of quantum physics IS nothing but this business<br>
of Fourier spaces showing up as a general principle in physical reality<br>
itself.<br>
<p>
Of course, this just begs the question of the priority of, and relation <br>
between, mental spaces and physical spaces.  One of the biggest unanswered<br>
questions in the philosophy of science is the uncanny correlation physical<br>
reality and the totally arcane branches of mathematics that sometimes get<br>
discovered centuries before they are shown to have any relationship to<br>
physical reality.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; We'll leave aside the completeness of complex-number realms for now.</i><br>
<p>
But not for too long I hope?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Katsuhiro Nakamura in "Quantum Chaos" (1993) discusses how quantum chaos</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires that we "go beyond Schrödinger's or Feynman's framework of quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanics."  He begins discussing 'broken symmetry in dissipative</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures' and energy systems without time-reversal symmetry.  He improves</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schrödinger's formalism of quantum mechanics by replacing the time</i><br>
<i>&gt; derivative in the time-dependent equation with a time difference, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; he wants to refer to time-chaotic waves rather than time-periodic waves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus, he discretizes time with a delta-t, a suitable 'time quantum,' and</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses a discrete version of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; He goes on to say: "Time discretization will necessitate much more complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; discretization of space-time....  [I]f temporal chaos is brought into</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum mechanics, our ideas on time, stationary states, the adiabatic</i><br>
<i>&gt; ansatz and their relationship with the uncertainty principle should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; carefully re-examined.  These intriguing questions (even within</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonrelativistic quantum mechanics) would be comparable to Einstein's great</i><br>
<i>&gt; challenge in 1905 which revolutionized Galilean thought on space and time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In nature, external sources of randomness such as noise, impurities and</i><br>
<i>&gt; random potentials are inevitable elements.  These effects have so far been</i><br>
<i>&gt; regarded as the unique source of spectral width in magnetic resonance,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fluctuations in conductance, etc., but quantum chaos ­ deterministic</i><br>
<i>&gt; randomness ­ may be a novel alternative candidate for spectral width and</i><br>
<i>&gt; fluctuations in various observables."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I cannot help but think that with a more complete discretization of</i><br>
<i>&gt; space-time, that one discrete state cannot happen, the universal discrete</i><br>
<i>&gt; state of *now* cannot de duplicated exactly in the next 'time quantum' for</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious reasons.  This closes off one propagation avenue in the negative</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy direction, leaving advanced action with more than 50% of</i><br>
<i>&gt; microcausality.  Thus, we go forward instead of backward, time-reversal</i><br>
<i>&gt; asymmetry.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I see it as a very really possibility that we will find a dichotomy <br>
in which both continuous (above plank scale that is) and discrete time systems<br>
coexist.  In fact by symmetry, it must be this way considering how energy and<br>
time are tied together the way they are; the more one is continuous, the more<br>
the other must be quantized.  We fail to notice this symmetry because, we fail<br>
to take seriously the reality of momentum space and the fact that what we see<br>
as quantized energy IS time itself from the perspective of momentum space.<br>
<p>
Yes, momentum space has its own arrow of time which is not only backwards to <br>
ours, but quantized by what we call energy to boot (the direction of the <br>
arrow being defined by the default temporal direction that wave packets in<br>
that Fourier space spontaneously spread).  This is the overlooked symmetry<br>
that allows time-symmetric dynamic laws to create asymmetric time in the <br>
first place.  The symmetry reappears when we realize that momentum space <br>
has its own (backwards to us) arrow of time with its own 2nd law of thermo-<br>
dynamics that must be obeyed.  <br>
<p>
Likewise, we might expect that a "global" 2nd law also exists such that <br>
violations of probability are allowed within either realm so long as it's<br>
conserved globally.  Such a global conservation of the 2nd law is not phy-<br>
sically impossible, but the only good metaphor for describing this sort of<br>
meta-time that I've yet seen is P. K. Dick's idea of "an orthogonal time"<br>
that operates in the meta-reality behind what we currently know.  In this<br>
system of meta-time, the 2nd law would be conserved globally so long as <br>
the mass and volume of the cosmos never decreases within meta-time.  <br>
<p>
Modern cosmology already knows this in its understanding that "bouncing<br>
big-bangs" must always get larger.  There is no new physics here, only<br>
a recognition of the time-symmetries that comes from a generalization of<br>
our concept of reality as applying equally to all Fourier spaces.  With<br>
this comes an understanding that a generalized math capable of reconcil-<br>
ing all the Fourier spaces within reality is going to require a system<br>
that combines continuous differential equations with fractals and other<br>
forms of discrete math into a seamless whole.  There is certainly, in <br>
this, a nobel prize awaiting some young mathematical genius (Eliezer?).<br>
<p>
This also leads to the realization of the ultimate extropian dream of <br>
physically relocating to an alternative Fourier space when one's local <br>
"universe" becomes too "entropic".  It's just another more advanced form<br>
of uploading.  Just like we could well gain a general ability to do up-<br>
loading and other forms of "personal designer life" in the near future,<br>
there is no reason why, in the far future trillions of years from now,<br>
we couldn't build bodies in an alternative Fourier space; after all with <br>
modern QM we already know how to manipulate momentum space.  In fact, we<br>
don't even need any fundamentally new science here, just a few eons of<br>
practice developing our quantum engineering skills, which is something<br>
that our existing universe is certainly still good for.  In doing this,<br>
we need merely brush up on our ability to utilize the momentum space<br>
analogs of gravity and electromagnetism (which we already know about in<br>
the phenomena of Bose-Einstein condensation and fermion spin-pairing<br>
respectively) to build up the structures we need.<br>
<p>
Not withstanding my own writings about the role of Fourier spaces in<br>
human thought, it's clear that our monkey brains aren't really good at<br>
viewing this equally well from all angles.  And yet I find it amazing<br>
that we do as well as we do in understanding this stuff.<br>
