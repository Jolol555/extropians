Me neither, but after finishing the course I can pretend :-)<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Well, we can't do experiments, but we can try observing the results of <br>
various kinds of schooling and parenting styles on personality. Still <br>
hard, but at least possible (the trouble is that many schools of <br>
psychology pretend they already know and don't take lightly to anybody <br>
questioning them). <br>
<p>
I'm personally a fan of cognitive schemes, since they have worked<br>
excellent for me: if you understand why you behave in a certain way, it<br>
becomes easier to change or re-evaluate it to suit your ideals. But it <br>
might not work for everyone, and requires either that the child thinks <br>
for itself about these things (can be done in many cases with the right <br>
stimulance; very fascinating) or together with an adult. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; By finding out why the avoider avoids learning (lack of interest, social</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pressure, resistance to authority, the use of wrong sensory modalities in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; teaching etc.) and circumventing or removing the hinder. The most </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but what if it is a personality trait. Insulin shocks? Neurosurgery? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Giving up?</i><br>
<p>
Giving up is by definition not a winning strategy. <br>
<p>
If you are introverted and don't like studying because you have to deal<br>
with a lot of people, get singled out by teacher questions etc., then the<br>
right solution probably isn't changing the introversion trait (prozac?)<br>
but how you deal with it. <br>
<p>
One solution would be a less demanding form of teaching, say one teacher<br>
that gives problems you can solve on your own while still remaining<br>
present to help (might be hard to come by/expensive, but would probably be<br>
very good if handled well). Another way would be to help you learn how to<br>
deal with other people; are they really that intrusive? <br>
<p>
In short, even if personality may have partial biological origins, it is <br>
quite possible to do something useful with it. What we may need is better <br>
methods and ways to measure their results, but the beginnings already exist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; important thing is to learn what triggers the enthusiasm of the student - </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whatever that may be - and then link it to learning. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Current systems can't achieve this. This would need a personalized </i><br>
<i>&gt; programme for every child, a couple of hard-to-fool agents benchmarking</i><br>
<i>&gt; the development of the child/concocting its future programme. Even with a </i><br>
<i>&gt; child:teacher ratio approaching unity this would be difficult to do, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; a computer system? in an notoriously conservative/finance-cut </i><br>
<i>&gt; environment, while the rest of the IT technology flashes past development </i><br>
<i>&gt; stages, rate of acceleration itself increasing? Difficult. We don't have </i><br>
<i>&gt; even emate300 approval yet, and it is a puny machine, compared to what </i><br>
<i>&gt; infrastructure is actually needed.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly! So, how do we get from here to there-abouts? <br>
<p>
I am working on a position paper for Aleph about education, and <br>
here are some of my ideas:<br>
<p>
The current idea of a limited period of education at the start of life<br>
(starting after a period of idealized childhood, ending around the end of<br>
adolescence) giving enough knowledge and skills to successfully live one's<br>
life is plain useless, and industrial-age. Things change faster and<br>
faster, and that makes skills consumables. What is needed (and this is<br>
given lip service in much of the debate) is continual learning throughout<br>
life.<br>
<p>
What we really need is something like this: First a period of education<br>
that may co-exist with childhood (there is nothing wrong with teaching<br>
young children things which they can understand and use); it does not have<br>
to be in any traditional classroom setting, but may ideally be integrated<br>
in other activities. It could turn more formal as the children grow up.<br>
This basic education would teach people mainly how to learn and grow. <br>
<p>
The second part of education would extend throughout life, and be as<br>
integrated as possible with everyday activities (state dependent learning:<br>
you can apply what you learn in school at school problems, but not<br>
reality). For this we need an education culture, where learning is seen as<br>
positive and natural and where there exists an useful infrastructure for<br>
it. There is still room for universities (after all, some people *should*<br>
be locked up in ivory towers :-) and other forms of organized education,<br>
but there exists a great variety of ways of getting learning<br>
(Libertarians: start chanting 'education markets' now! :-). Since there <br>
exists education in many forms, it is more likely that at least some <br>
variants will fit the learning styles of a certain person, and the <br>
education culture is self-reinforcing once it has begun to flourish.<br>
<p>
Can this be done? I actually think so, in the past we have seen that<br>
groups (such as the study movements here in Sweden) have managed to create<br>
things like this (although they tend to become static parts of the system<br>
after a while). We have a much larger and more complex world to deal with,<br>
but also better media. The Web could be an ideal medium to create huge<br>
libraries of basic tutorials about many subjects, making it easy to learn<br>
the basic concepts and then find a teacher or other way to train them etc. <br>
<p>
Note also that we do not necessarily need government support; the study<br>
movements worked fine on their own (it was when they got involved with the<br>
emerging "people's home" they became static), much of the resources can be<br>
created by amateurs or businessmen. The main problem is to sell this<br>
vision to people, to convince them that it is possible and desirable. Once<br>
the infrastructure and interest are in place, it will become much more<br>
natural to change the basic education system since it will be obvious that<br>
learning the rivers of Halland (the Swedish equivalent to learning the<br>
great lakes) is not as important as learning how to get the right<br>
information from the Net. <br>
<p>
Comments?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That was the thing I was trying to convey. To change current paedagogical </i><br>
<i>&gt; system is not just curing a case of (resisting) imbecility, but to quest </i><br>
<i>&gt; against the current state of the world itself. Somewhat difficult.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but as somebody's .sig file said: "Nothing is too ambitious for <br>
extropians!" :-)<br>
