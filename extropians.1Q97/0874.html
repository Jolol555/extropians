Hey Extropes,<br>
<p>
I ran across something accidently on the net today regarding the Creationists'<br>
point-of-view. Arguing with Creationists is not something I tend to do<br>
in my daily activities, so I almost never pay attention to conversations<br>
of this nature. But if you are in a position where you are doing this<br>
activity, or you would like to do this activity, it would be good to get<br>
an idea of their perspectives and logic, so hence, this site is a<br>
valuable resource:<br>

"Unmasking the False Religion of Evolution"<br>
<a href="http://www.hsv.tis.net/~ke4vol/evolve/ndxng.html">http://www.hsv.tis.net/~ke4vol/evolve/ndxng.html</a><br>
<p>
The author of this site has pulled together many different<br>
arguments to prove his point. So take a look. I was amazed at the<br>
number of misunderstandings and misconceptions. At least in the<br>
astronomy portion that I looked at. It's like the author heard a fact,<br>
took it out of context, and wove a logical theory around it. (This<br>
sort of twisting of facts reminds me quite a bit of the Communist<br>
propaganda that I have seen and read, in the past.)<br>
<p>
To give you an idea, I am posting below some of the astronomy "arguments"<br>
that I saw there. FYI, only. (I don't have the time to discuss astronomy<br>
with these people, although it is really tempting.)<br>

Sun Shrinkage Rate<br>
Let's look at some more facts from science-another coin from the treasure<br>
chest. The sun is burning! How many of you knew that already? As the sun<br>
burns, the sun is shrinking. Boyle Observatory in England has been<br>
keeping careful records of the sun's diameter for 300 years. It<br>
oscillates a little bit, but the general trend is that the sun is<br>
shrinking 5 feet every hour. That has been the case for the 300 years<br>
that it has been observed. Dealing with science that is observable,<br>
testable, and demonstrable, the sun is shrinking. Now this is going to<br>
be complicated. If the sun is shrinking that means it used to be what?<br>
That's right; it used to be bigger. Five feet per hour is the shrinkage<br>
rate; so, if you were to go back in time to an hour ago, the sun would<br>
have been 5 feet bigger. If you go back a few thousand years ago, there<br>
would be no problem. If you want to tell me that the earth is millions<br>
of years old, then we have a problem. Twenty million years ago the sun<br>
would have been very big at the current shrinkage rate assuming that it<br>
is a linear progression, or that it might be geometric, or logismic. I<br>
understand all of that. I taught mathematics and science. Either way, it<br>
puts a time limit on this model. If you excel 20 million years ago at<br>
today's shrinkage rate the sun would have been so big that it would<br>
touch the earth. This of course would have made life very<br>
uncomfortable.<br>
<p>
If you want to tell me that the dinosaurs lived 70 million years ago,<br>
they would have fried. They would have been charbroiled. They would have<br>
been inside the sun. The world cannot be millions of years old. You will<br>
have to alter your theory to fit within a shorter timeframe than that.<br>
<p>
                           Existence of Comets<br>
Let's take a look at some additional facts of science. Comets fly around<br>
the solar system, and comets are constantly losing material. You can't<br>
just keep losing and losing because pretty soon you will have a problem.<br>
It's kind of like your checkbook. You see; the Bible is very plain: if<br>
your out go exceeds your income, your upkeep will be your downfall.<br>
Astronomers guess that comets only last about 10,000 years and then they<br>
break apart. Now, that brings up a very good question. Why do we still<br>
have comets? They should all be gone! People ask me, "Hey that is a very<br>
interesting concept. Why do we still have comets?" I'm just a high<br>
school science teacher, but here is my theory. I believe the Bible. I<br>
believe about 6,000 years ago God created the heavens and the earth, and<br>
that is why we still have comets. Our universe is only about 6 or 7<br>
thousand years old. Simple! That explains the comet. That explains the<br>
shrinking sun. It also explains the population.<br>
<p>
                               Stellar Facts<br>
Scientists say, "It takes thousands of millions of years for stars to<br>
evolve from red giants to white dwarfs." You had better study your<br>
history. All of the ancient astronomers said that Sirius was a red star.<br>
Today it is a white dwarf. This occurred within 2,000 years not millions<br>
of years. Stellar evolution needs to be rethought. They say that it<br>
takes millions of years for these planets to cool off. Wait a minute!<br>
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are all hot, and yet they are rapidly<br>
cooling off.<br>
<p>
If we walked into a room and found a cup of coffee on the table that was<br>
boiling hot, I would say, "Don't touch that, it's hot." You would say,<br>
"Whose is it?" Then I would say, "I don't know. It's been sitting there<br>
for 4,000 years." It's so hot, yet it has been sitting there for 4,000<br>
years. Don't you think that is a little far fetched? The planets are not<br>
billions of years old.<br>
<p>
Saturn's rings are still expanding, and they are not billions of years<br>
old. They are still separating the particles by the Pointing Robertson<br>
Effect. They are not billions of years old.<br>
<p>
                          Distance To The Moon<br>
The moon goes around the earth. As the moon goes around the earth, the<br>
moon is getting further and further away. We are slowly losing the moon<br>
a couple of inches a year; no big deal; it's nothing to worry about.<br>
This is going to be complicated; so, read very carefully. If the moon is<br>
getting further and further away from the earth, that means that it used<br>
to be closer. Scientists will agree with that. Now, wait a minute! A<br>
couple of thousand years ago that wouldn't make a big difference. If you<br>
want to tell me that the earth is millions or billions of years old, you<br>
had better get your calculator because it makes for a serious problem.<br>
If you bring the moon back in closer, it would cause trouble because the<br>
moon causes the tides. If you bring the moon back in a couple of million<br>
years ago, the tides would have been so high that it would have drowned<br>
everything on earth twice a day. Everybody knows that you can only drown<br>
comfortably once a day. If you want to tell me that the dinosaurs lived<br>
70 million years ago, then I know what happened to them. They got sick<br>
of drowning twice a day! Man, they quit! They gave up! They said, "This<br>
evolving is too hard; I'm not going to do this anymore!" The simple fact<br>
is: the earth cannot be billions of years old.<br>
