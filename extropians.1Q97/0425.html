In land animals, body size hasn't been increasing for quite a while.<br>
 Elephants are quite a bit smaller than many dinosaurs, and even smaller than<br>
several of the biggest mammals of the past.  Whales are indeed bigger than<br>
anything before, but that's only at sea.  But the smartest dino<br>
(Nanotyrannosaurus, I think) had an encephalization quotient about that of an<br>
ostrich, which is about as dumb a large land animal you can find today.<br>
<p>
I did miss something.  What exactly do you mean by a local tendency?<br>
