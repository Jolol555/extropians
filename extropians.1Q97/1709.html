And now, brought to you by the originator of formal ethical systems and<br>
The Interim Meaning of Life, a cognitive analysis of "free will".  I<br>
have a detailed answer but not much free time, so this is the short<br>
version and snap summary.  I realize that some of you may disagree with<br>
what I say, but I don't have the time to justify it, so please do not<br>
challenge me (rather than politely disagreeing) unless you find a flaw<br>
in my logic (rather than my assumptions).<br>
<p>
1)  Everything we say about "free will" is an artifact of the way we<br>
view causality.<br>
  Because people were talking about free will long before they knew<br>
anything about physics.<br>
<p>
2)  Causality, in human intuition, is counterfactual.<br>
  When we say "A caused B", we mean that, if A were not present, B would<br>
not have been present, and that in order to get B one should do A. <br>
(This is a cognitive, not an ontological, statement about "causality".)<br>
<p>
3)  "Determinism" conflicts with "free will".<br>
  "If reality is deterministic, than instead of your thoughts<br>
determining your actions, your actions are predetermined; therefore<br>
whatever you do isn't your fault."<br>
<p>
4)  Determinism does not conflict with free will.<br>
  If your thoughts were not present, you would not have committed your<br>
actions.  Therefore your thoughts do cause your actions; *you* cause<br>
your actions; and there is no moral problem with blaming you for your<br>
actions.  There is no distinction between deterministic you and<br>
deterministic reality; even if reality is deterministic, you are still<br>
the source of what happens and what you do makes a difference.  QED(*).<br>
<p>
Right?  Doesn't this cognitive analysis dovetail exactly with our<br>
intuitions on the subject?  Our intuitive model of determinism<br>
conflicting with free will goes like this:  If the outcome is prewritten<br>
in the Book of God, than what we do must "match" that outcome and isn't<br>
our fault.  In other words, our thoughts are coerced to match the<br>
prewritten outcome, and the prewritten outcome is the causal source of<br>
our misdeeds.  As if the outcome of your decision were *explicitly*<br>
written in your brain, and your thoughts tuned to match.  Were this the<br>
case, the explicitly prewritten outcome would indeed be the source of<br>
your misdeeds and you couldn't be blamed for them.<br>
<p>
This model of deterministic reality is incorrect; what we will do is not<br>
explicitly written within our brains.  We, ourselves, still reach the<br>
decision of our own free will.  That which produces the outcome is<br>
identical with our thoughts and ourselves; hence free will.<br>
<p>
Epigrammatic snap summary:<br>
The outcome may be pre-written in our brains, but WE are the writing.<br>
