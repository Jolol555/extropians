Share the accumulated wealth and you have no investment. No investment, no<br>
jobs, no progress, lots of poverty.<br>
<p>
Of course it's self-interest to accumulate millions and billions. If I had<br>
billions I would be funding technologies starting with life extension to my<br>
benefit. I'd be delighted that many other people would benefit too, but<br>
certainly it would benefit me.<br>
<p>
If you think that simply having wealthy people give away their money to the<br>
poor will abolish poverty, you're so far from the understand of the<br>
economic world that Extropians have that this discussion doesn't belong on<br>
this list. This list is not intended to debate such basics. Read the<br>
