<i>&gt; That's certainly what it tries to achieve, but I fear that Lojban's</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal, a cultureless language, are logically impossible.  It takes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular cultural point of view to banish all cultural points of view.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It takes a huge cultural assumption to assume that Lojban is even</i><br>
<i>&gt; "logical," from a philosophical point of view.  (That's one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; points I find appealing about pancritical rationalism.)  Ultimately, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; long as logic is under debate, rationalism itself must heave under its</i><br>
<i>&gt; own cultural baggage.</i><br>
<p>
I've never understood these "it isn't perfect, so why bother doing it<br>
at all" arguments.  The goal of more effective communication and thought<br>
is a worthy one.  Even the specific idea of improving language has<br>
clear support as an Extropian goal in things like E-prime, which is to<br>
Lojban as fixing a tail light is to rebuilding an engine.<br>
<p>
Your misperception that Lojban has any "philosophy" or "claims" to be<br>
anything is so far off that I can only assume you have learned about it<br>
second hand rather than from the source.  Lojban was created as a means<br>
of testing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and designed with that goal in<br>
mind.  Its grammar and phonology, based on predicate logic, also make<br>
it well suited for computer processing.  That's all.  It doesn't "claim"<br>
to be "logical" (whatever that claim even means), and it doesn't claim<br>
to be culture-free, it just is what it is--structured on predicate logic,<br>
and not containing many specific cultural artifacts that have been<br>
identified in other human languages.  And don't confuse PCR with naive<br>
skepticism--logic exists; how one uses it is another matter.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that although Lojban does have the identity<br>
relationship, it is almost never used in normal conversation.  Not<br>
because it is deprecated or avoided, just because the design of the<br>
language makes it not particularly useful.<br>
<p>
This exchange does answer one question though--since yours is the<br>
only response, it is clear that there is little interest here.  Pity.<br>
