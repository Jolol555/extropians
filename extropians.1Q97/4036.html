<p>
"Proof" is never going to be there.  If this is your position, you<br>
needn't concern yourself with all these economic details.  <br>
<p>
There must be economic models somewhere which imply that states should<br>
provide food and housing.  If the existence of models on both sides of<br>
an issue implied we could conclude nothing about that issue, then<br>
economic modeling would be pretty useless.  The point is that there<br>
are widely accepted standards for judging which models are more<br>
reasonable.  Some assumptions are more reasonable than others, and<br>
some modeling techniques suggest less robust results than others.<br>
<p>
The model David Friedman offered which may suggest state support for<br>
IP seems more reasonable to me than any model I've every heard of<br>
regarding state provided housing and food.  A more plausible model<br>
implies a stronger case for the model implications.<br>
