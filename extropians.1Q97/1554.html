Very recently there have been two new developments in the world of Quantum  <br>
Computers. In the January 17 1997 issue of Science is a long article called <br>
"Bulk Spin-Resonance Quantum Computation" by Neil A Gershenfield and Issac <br>
L Chuang, there is also an editorial about the article in the same issue. <br>
It talks about hardware methods of isolating a Quantum Computer from the<br>
environment so you don't get Quantum decoherience and suggests using Nuclear <br>
Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The nucleus of atoms are like spinning bar magnets, <br>
and they  can be in 2 states, spin up or spin down. If you send in a radio <br>
pulse of the exact frequency you can change the spin state of the atom from <br>
one to another. This frequency can change if an atom is coupled to another <br>
atom, so if you pick the correct frequency you could flip the spin of a <br>
carbon atom if and only if the Hydrogen atom it is coupled with is spinning <br>
up. This could make a controlled logic NOT gate.<br>
<p>
This would also be a Quantum logic gate, because a radio pulse can also put <br>
an atom in a superposition of states, both spin up and spin down at the same <br>
time, and anything coupled to that state would also be in a superposition of  <br>
states. There are 4 advantages to using NMR to make a Quantum computer rather  <br>
than other methods:<br>
<p>
1) The quantum state of interest is in the nucleus and is protected from   <br>
   contamination from the outside world by the electron cloud so the quantum   <br>
   state lasts a long time. In most other quantum systems decoherence happens   <br>
   in pico or femtoseconds but with NMR it can last for thousands of seconds.<br>
<p>
2) You don't have to worry about every single atom, if only 50.000001%  point   <br>
   up, that's good enough. I quote Tim Havel, who independently discovered   <br>
   most of the thing in the article at the about the same time, "It turns out    <br>
   having a well-defined statistical excess of a single quantum state is<br>
   enough to do quantum computing. You don't need to have every molecule <br>
   doing exactly the same thing".<br>
<p>
3) By using a large number of atoms to store a qbit it further protects it  <br>
   against unwanted external interactions.<br>
<p>
4) You don't need expensive exotic gadgets, cheap off the shelf equipment   <br>
   will do for NMR.<br>
<p>
The authors actually hope to have a small (10 qbit) quantum computer in <br>
operation in a few years, possibly as soon as next summer. With such a <br>
machine you could factor (drum roll please) the number 15. Hey don't laugh, <br>
it would be a proof of concept and could serve as a test bed to develop <br>
better quantum algorithms, and remember, each time you add a qbit to your<br>
computer you double its power.<br>
<p>
Speaking of better quantum algorithms, we'll need some to go much higher than <br>
30 qbits using NMR, and to quote Gershenfield "Somewhere between 50 and 100 <br>
qbits is where calculations start to get interesting". Still, people are <br>
optimistic, to quote Gershenfield again "If researchers can figure out how to <br>
extend the technology to larger qbit numbers the future is unlimited.<br>
<p>
In a separate development, on January 27 researchers at Xerox announced that  <br>
they have made a small molecule of manganese, oxygen, carbon and hydrogen <br>
that acts like a powerful magnet. They said it might be possible to use this <br>
material to make  a disk drive that could store information at the molecular <br>
level and hold millions of times as much data as we can today, but that's not <br>
what they  emphasized. I think it's interesting that at the announcement they <br>
spent more time talking about how it could be used in a Quantum computer <br>
rather than a conventional one. The material has a property called Quantum <br>
Magnetic Hysteresis, it can be in a superposition of many different magnetic <br>
states at the same time, and that's just what a Quantum Computer is all about.<br>
<p>
For me It's still hard for me for it to sink in that an otherworldly object  <br>
like a Quantum computer could actually exist in our worldly universe, but <br>
it's beginning to look like one can really be built. If so the world will <br>
never be the same.<br>
