<p>
 While Strauss &amp; Howe are worth reading, their predictions do not<br>
appear to be specific enough (at least in Generations) to be clearly<br>
IMPORTANT, and I doubt they can produce more specific predictions<br>
without being wrong on a majority of predictions.<br>
<p>
 Here is part of an email that I sent to Robin a year ago on this<br>
subject:<br>
<p>
 I have been excited in the past by cyclical theories of history in<br>
the past, and that excitement has always produced frustration about<br>
the difficulty of producing accurate forecasts from those theories.<br>
For instance, Klingberg's theory looked quite impressive in the 70s<br>
when I read it. It did a good job of predicting when the public's<br>
mood would turn against the Vietnam war (1968-1969), and could have<br>
predicted the declining support for NASA and international airline<br>
traffic if it had been phrased a bit more broadly. I was eager to<br>
profit from this theory in 1989 by buying military stocks or Pan Am,<br>
but found no confirmation of the theory at that time.<br>
<p>
 Generations' descriptions of economic cycles (p. 355) is inconsistent<br>
with Kondratieff wave analysis, and appears to be much less supported<br>
by the evidence than Kondratieff's theory. I wonder how many other<br>
claims in Generations would look suspiscious if I checked them out<br>
carefully.<br>
