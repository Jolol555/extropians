<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; If you think I misinterpret your words, rephrase them, define them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  exemplify them.  I'll try to understand, but if my best attempt at</i><br>
<i>&gt;  doing so evaluates them as nonsense, don't expect me to hesitate in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  saying so. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is fine, but since you have told me I talk nonsense, you are clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasting your time and mine, it would hardly be productive for me to try and</i><br>
<i>&gt; define anything further, or have dialogue with you, especially since you</i><br>
<i>&gt; consistatly think I am telling you what to do anyway, and I have no interest</i><br>
<i>&gt; in that.</i><br>
<p>
It is not a waste of my time to try to understand someone who, by<br>
virtue of her choice of forum, has demonstrated shared interests and<br>
values.  If you don't feel it would be productive to further clarify<br>
your point of view, I won't force you.  But I assumed from your<br>
choice to participate in this forum that you welcomed discussion.<br>
<p>
And this last sentence of yours just baffles me completely.  In what<br>
way do I "consistently think you're telling me what to do"?  Please<br>
show me one statement of mine that evidences that.  What I really<br>
consistently think is that we are engaged in conversation to discover<br>
the nature of things, and empower our minds.  Nothing more, nothing<br>
less.  Is that not the purpose of discourse?  Of our lives?<br>
