I was going to let this thread die for lack of time, but Mr de<br>
Lyser let me know by private mail that he was interested in seeing<br>
my reply, and that he'd like to carry on the discussion in public.<br>
<p>
J. de Lyser writes:<br>
<i> &gt;Socialism did work for Russia in the first half of the century, (even</i><br>
<i> &gt;authoritarian) but don't force me into defending a system i don't believe</i><br>
<i> &gt;in.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not forcing you to do anything. You just *chose* to defend<br>
Lenin's Russia. As far as I'm concerned, any system in which I<br>
could be taken from my home by the authorities without warning and<br>
shot in the back of the head for no particular reason is a system<br>
which does not work. So I dispute your assertion, as well as pinning<br>
all the responsibility for making that assertion on you.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I'm just saying many polictical systems have elements that are</i><br>
<i> &gt;productive and elements that are counterproductive. And that  denying that</i><br>
<i> &gt;is irrational. </i><br>
<p>
This is irrelevant because I haven't denied any such thing.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Counterproductive policies are present in most political systems. Having a</i><br>
<i> &gt;(minimal) state/ or having policies *should* allow a society  control over</i><br>
<i> &gt;natural forces that become counterproductive, needless to say it's often</i><br>
<i> &gt;the state that institutionalises counterproduvtive policies. Saying there's</i><br>
<i> &gt;more counterproductive policies in socialist thought than in capitalist</i><br>
<i> &gt;thougth i agree to wholeheartedly. Saying theres no counterproductivity in</i><br>
<i> &gt;capitalist systems is denying facts, saying there will be none in any other</i><br>
<i> &gt;proposed system is utopy.  </i><br>
<i> &gt;'laissez faire' ideals are very high on my list of priorities, but assuring</i><br>
<i> &gt;they keep working somehow is a logical goal isn't it ? </i><br>
<p>
The only sense I can make of this is that you are assuming that<br>
the state is necessary for redressing "counterproductive policies".<br>
But this is vague. I have no interest in redressing anyone else's<br>
counterproductive policies, as long as they don't mess with me, my<br>
friends, or my stuff. There are problems involving commons,<br>
externalities, and public goods, and some of these are severe<br>
problems for local governments. But nearly all such things should<br>
be handled by local governments, yet most tax funds in my country<br>
go to the Federal government or to fulfilling Federal government<br>
mandates. Are you saying that if someone chooses to engage in<br>
"counterproductivity" on their own time and with their own stuff,<br>
that the State should step in and "correct" them? Please be more<br>
specific if this is not what you mean.<br>
<p>
Assuring that "laissez faire" ideals "keep working somehow" doesn't<br>
seem to be anything that any State that I know has been very<br>
effective at doing. All that's needed is for people to refrain from<br>
violating one another's persons and property, and the vast majority<br>
of people do that anyway because it's how they want to be treated<br>
by strangers. The few who do not do that anyway hardly require that<br>
50% of the gross world product be spent on suppressing them, yet<br>
that's how much (approximately) this planet spends on government.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;ALL political systems legitimize the use of violence to punish voluntary</i><br>
<i> &gt;and consensual exchange to some degree (you've already stated an example</i><br>
<i> &gt;later on in your reply). The problem here is that your 'specific negative</i><br>
<i> &gt;externality' is a very vague concept, and may very well conflict with the</i><br>
<i> &gt;both the 'voluntary' and 'consensual'  parts of your statement. </i><br>
<p>
It's not vague at all... it's a technical term from microeconomics. And<br>
it is not true that all possible political systems legitimize the use of<br>
violence to punish voluntary and consensual exchange. You seem to think<br>
that I am defending some political system that is actually in practice<br>
today. I am not. There are political systems that have been practiced in<br>
the past that, with some fairly uncontroversial adjustments (mostly<br>
liberalizing ones) would suit me better than the system I live under<br>
now, but my political ideal is a new thing that has never been done<br>
before, just as our ideal of eternal life is a new thing that has never<br>
been done before.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Problem is that socialist thought is so integrated in our current societies</i><br>
<i> &gt;that it may not be possible to abandon without abandoning democracy. Why</i><br>
<i> &gt;spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, why not focus on ones that are</i><br>
<i> &gt;acchievable instead ?  </i><br>
<p>
I am perfectly content to abandon democracy. You'd better not<br>
respond to this line, though, I hear that advocating such things<br>
can land one in jail in Europe.<br>
<p>
&lt;irony&gt;<br>
Why spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, such as space<br>
migration, intelligence increase, and life extension? Why not focus<br>
on ones that are achievable instead, like cutting taxes while<br>
at the same time improving state-provided medical care and education?<br>
&lt;/irony&gt;<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Nor do i Eric, i assure you. Like you their are policies of political</i><br>
<i> &gt;systems i would never 'go with', but i don't think you fully realize that a</i><br>
<i> &gt;political system and it's infrastructure forms an individuals sense of</i><br>
<i> &gt;Reality. His rationality, his ethics, his LOGIC are shaped to work within</i><br>
<i> &gt;that system. And personally i don't see why there could have been no</i><br>
<i> &gt;transhumanist movement in even a communist state, or a fascist state,</i><br>
<i> &gt;ofcourse linked with ideals we would all view very sceptically.</i><br>
<p>
There were certainly some actively transhumanistic people in Russia,<br>
following in Tsiolkovski's footsteps. Some of them got out after<br>
the revolution, and some of them stayed inside and tried to make<br>
the best of things there, and I salute their courage for not just<br>
giving up in the circumstances in which they found themselves. I<br>
am *not* attempting to change the political system anyone else<br>
lives under. I have seen political ideals, just ideas, do a *hell*<br>
of a lot of damage in history, yet I do not believe in using force<br>
to suppress political ideals with which I disagree. Because I will<br>
not sanction the use of force to suppress such ideals, I thereby<br>
feel what amounts to nearly an obligation to oppose those dangerous<br>
ideals in argument wherever I encounter them. That's the basis of<br>
my response to Jim Legg. I'm still not sure I understand why you<br>
are objecting to the response I made to Jim Legg.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;What i am saying is that transhumanist goals are very high on my list of</i><br>
<i> &gt;priorities, higher maybe than political systems and their policies, but not</i><br>
<i> &gt;higher than human rights and freedom. Some people on this list just place</i><br>
<i> &gt;their political priorities (personal?) over the long term priotities of</i><br>
<i> &gt;humanity, i guess. </i><br>
<p>
No. I honestly believe that that the State is an atavism, a left-over, a<br>
self-perpetuating relic of the violence and warfare that routinely<br>
characterized early Middle-Eastern civilization. I don't think war and<br>
crime can be done away with eternally, but I think that the existence of<br>
a system of nation-states causes more crime and warfare than it<br>
prevents. I honestly believe this, so for you to rebuke my political<br>
priorities for being "personal" or "selfish" is totally incorrect. If I<br>
were truly selfish in my politics, I would have no interest in political<br>
persuasion at all. I'd just avoid the state and let other people suffer.<br>
Furthermore, I think it is the political structure of this planet that<br>
consitutes the single greatest barrier to transhumanist goals. I do not<br>
place a higher priority on political goals than on transhumanist goals,<br>
instead, my sense of urgency about my political goals stems directly<br>
from the fact that in my opinion implementing my political goals will<br>
directly and immediately contribute to my chances of success in<br>
implementing my transhumanist goals.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Oh i did notice, i also noticed that libertarians political influence is</i><br>
<i> &gt;very small, and allthough i sincerely hope that will change,  i also hope</i><br>
<i> &gt;transhumanists among them do not lose their sense of reality. I don't</i><br>
<i> &gt;favour socialist thought, but the majority in your country seems to do so</i><br>
<i> &gt;for the moment, even though THEY may not be aware of it being socialist</i><br>
<i> &gt;thought :-).</i><br>
<p>
Someone must oppose that majority and raise that awareness. Where does<br>
it start? Besides, I'd never have gotten to where I am now if I'd ever<br>
spent much time worrying about whether or not other people thought I had<br>
lost my "sense of reality", whatever that means. I've got a perfectly<br>
good nervous system, and I'll take that over a "sense of reality" any<br>
day.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;ANY planning/strategy a RATIONAL organisation has, cannot allow their</i><br>
<i> &gt;personal dislike of certain policies to blind themselves to these. Refusing</i><br>
<i> &gt;to accept that they are there, and will be there for the immediate future</i><br>
<i> &gt;to deal with, will lead to fleeing / hiding oneself in utopy, and will</i><br>
<i> &gt;certainly be counterproductive...      </i><br>
<p>
What made you think I was espousing anything like this? I think you are<br>
jumping to conclusions about what course of action I am endorsing. I<br>
have no idea how to most effectively attack the state. Actually, I have<br>
a few ideas, and the cypherpunks are already actively working on some of<br>
them. There are other routes. None of them look particularly promising<br>
by themselves, but with several different people working on several<br>
different routes at once, perhaps things will improve over the long<br>
term, just as they had been improving politically for hundreds of years<br>
before the twentieth century. If I get any bright ideas that I don't<br>
already see a lot of people working on, I'll let you know.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I don't doubt the seriousness of the people on this list and the ideals</i><br>
<i> &gt;they believe in. But fact remains that MOST peoples political choice is,</i><br>
<i> &gt;has always been, and will always remain based on their personal financial</i><br>
<i> &gt;improvement, and are perfectly willing to give up some freedom for that, as</i><br>
<i> &gt;they perfectly logically mistake the organisational power of the state for</i><br>
<i> &gt;financial power. Bread and circusses... </i><br>
<p>
Of course it is based on their personal financial improvement. If enough<br>
people got *sincere* about being interested in their personal financial<br>
improvement they might study a little microeconomics and then it would<br>
become quite obvious to them how the politicians are robbing them<br>
blind. Perhaps I am playing a fool's game... perhaps the vast majority<br>
of people are congenitally incapable of thinking in microeconomic terms.<br>
I'll be sure to take a look at the study proving this as soon as it<br>
comes out, but I won't change my tune before then.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The Eurocracy of Europe is already forming, we now have four governements</i><br>
<i> &gt;to suck us dry instead of three. Yet it's reality,</i><br>
<p>
 [snip]<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Just say no to death and taxes.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;i keep saying no, but they keep coming back :-)</i><br>
<p>
I like Philip K. Dick's definition of reality: it's what doesn't<br>
go away when you stop believing in it. (You'd be surprised how much<br>
stuff turns out to be unreal under this definition.) On the other<br>
hand, I also like Robert Anton Wilson's definition of reality: it's<br>
what you can get away with. When you say the Eurocracy is real, I<br>
don't think you're thinking long-term enough. From a very-long-term<br>
perspective, these things are like clouds or mists, not like the<br>
laws of physics. I'm also aware that people use this same argument<br>
to try to get rid of the institution of private property, but I<br>
think by now that we've run that particular experiment enough times<br>
that we can stop repeating that mistake on empirical grounds. Every<br>
time societies have tried to get rid of the state in the past,<br>
they've started by trying to get rid of property. I think this is<br>
a precisely ass-backwards way to approach anarchism.<br>
<p>
Of course you need to treat the Eurocracy as real when deciding<br>
what to do this week or this month. But I think it is a very bad<br>
mistake to *assume* that the Eurocracy will be real in twenty years.<br>
The state is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has gone on fulfilling<br>
itself for thousands of years. Start breaking the chain. The state<br>
is *just* a group of people who have arrogated certain privileges<br>
to themselves, and that's all. Don't land yourself in jail, but at<br>
the very least, you could try to curb your temptation to use statist<br>
rhetoric, or to defend those who do so.  That would be a start.<br>
