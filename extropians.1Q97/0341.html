True, your own vote is worth little. But the memes you spread to<br>
influence others' votes are potentially much more powerful.<br>

Rule #72b: Never trust any conclusion that "the lesson from history is<br>
clear." Before H. sapiens came on the scene, the lesson from history was<br>
clear that no such creature could exist.<br>
<p>
You are right that cultural viruses such as governments evolve to<br>
increase their power. I wrote about this in Chapter 9 of Virus of the<br>
Mind. However, your conclusion that the people will then revolt at some<br>
point is unsupported. In fact, you could argue that the main benefit of<br>
a democracy is providing a kind of "safety valve" such that if the<br>
people get very upset, they can vote everybody out of office and feel<br>
like they've accomplished something without a revolution. Giving the<br>
vote to the 18-20-year-olds may have been a recognition of that process.<br>
<p>
Finally, any proposal to "eliminate governments completely" is silly on<br>
the face of it. Who would enforce it? The government? Human society is a<br>
meme pool. If you dissolve all the existing structures -- even if it<br>
were possible -- new structures would soon arise and self-organize.<br>
