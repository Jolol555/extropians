After enduring the elaborate and nearly unavoidable sports hype over the<br>
past few days I've decided that the sports meme is actually beneficial<br>
in that it sublimates a lot competitive and territorial behavior that<br>
would otherwise impact on more productive arenas.<br>
<p>
It's a close call, though.  This afternoon I watched a group of<br>
educators (who certainly have enough on their plate already) bring their<br>
discussion to an abrupt halt as it became obvious that their<br>
overwhelming concern was not the educational process but finishing up<br>
before "the game". A lot of energy gets dissipated in sportsbot<br>
activities, so it seems inherently wasteful.<br>
<p>
However, the truly creative people I know are not sportsbot types.  And<br>
the few sportsbot types I know are aggressive sorts that, frankly, need<br>
some kind of outlet.<br>
<p>
So, I score the whole sports thing as a marginal plus for society as a<br>
whole. <br>
Which doesn't keep me from being sick of it.<br>
