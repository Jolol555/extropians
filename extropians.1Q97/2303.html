Subject: NGF: exogenous, intracerebral, intraventricular etc.<br>
<p>
A few years ago, Don Stein reported that intracerebral administratioon<br>
of NGF improved pperformance of rats with cerebral lesions, but not<br>
normal rats; indeed, may have impaired performance of normal rats.<br>
<p>
He remarked on how little study of this there had been, but his own<br>
work has gone in a slightly diffeent direction (big focus on hormonal<br>
effects on recovery from brain lesions, especially estrogen and<br>
progesterone), so I am asking for any info about replications,<br>
extensions, other possibly relevant phenomena.<br>
<p>
DOES ANYBODY KNOW OF SUBSEQUENT STUDIES INVOLVING INTRACEREBRAL<br>
OR INTRAVENTRICULAR ADMINISTRATION OF NGF IN NORMAL ANIMALS?<br>
<p>
Also: not likely that anyhone would ut NGF into brains of normal human<br>
volunteers, BUT in cases of experimental treatment of neurological<br>
cconditions (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinsonism, etc.) which may have<br>
reported "no effect" (or maybe were NOT reported, because of "no<br>
effect), are there any you know of in which a DETRIMENTAL effect was in<br>
fact observed?<br>
<p>
I know oof at least one recent report of hyperalgesia, after PERIPHERAL<br>
injection, but this is not what I'm interested in.  I'm looking for<br>
reports of perhaps very subtle decrements in performance, after central<br>
administration, in humans or rodents, or--??<br>
