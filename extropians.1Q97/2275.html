<i>&gt; Dear Ed Regis,  I enjoyed reading your article on Julian Simon in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Feb 1997 edition of WIRED magazine.  I don't agree with Julian Simons</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas.  I visited his Homepage and have an idea of where he is coming</i><br>
<i>&gt; from as he labels the environmental movement a fraud by con artists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Julian Simon's perpective is anthropocentric, he really does not care</i><br>
<i>&gt; for anything else in the biological community.  P</i><br>
snipping....<br>
<i>&gt;  Valuable farm land is being paved over.  I think Mr. Simon would like</i><br>
<i>&gt; to lull Americans into a comfortable indifference on these issues so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that environmental regulations can be reduced or eliminated.  One not</i><br>
<i>&gt; convinced.  Cyber Ed</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Con artists are on both sides, but while many of the cons on the right<br>
are of a self deceptive nature, the ones on the left are ludicrous:<br>
<p>
1)a toxic waste recycling plant in CA was shut down by the EPA because<br>
they violated EPA regs that state that toxic waste cannot be recycled,<br>
that it must be stored in 55 gallon drums.<br>
<p>
2)fast food stores gave up using styrofoam because the EPA would not let<br>
them recycle  the containers (made of 100% recyclable polystyrene)<br>
because the styrofoam had once (GASP!!!) touched food!!!! Now they use<br>
specially made containers that are not recyclable at all due to their<br>
composite structure of paper, waxes, and plastic, but are using up many<br>
old growth trees in the process.<br>
<p>
3) the new head of the Sierra Club is advocating that the Glen Canyon<br>
Dam be torn down, to rebuild the previous ecosystem, even though any<br>
indigenous species exclusive to the original habitat are now extinct.<br>
Doing so would cause the already high power rates, and regional power<br>
deficits of the southwest to skyrocket, and mandate the building of<br>
fossil fuel power sources, which will contribute even more to the<br>
effects of global warming. Of course one wonders if maybe they are doing<br>
it on purpose....<br>
<p>
These are just a few, and, should people start shouting about ad<br>
homenim, blah blah blah, I could do more research and come up with more,<br>
as they do exist, of the completely insane things environmentalists do.<br>
<p>
I have found that many if not most environmentalist groups are in<br>
existence simply to raise funds by appearing to advocate rules and<br>
regulations that have an initial apparent purpose of making somebody<br>
else clean something up. They also typically wind up causing even more<br>
environmental damage across the board than they prevented (just look at<br>
the anti-nuke movement, which was incidentally funded by fossil fuel<br>
companies).<br>
