"The end of serendipity" is the argument that I hear most often against <br>
automated collaborative filtering and other agent technologies.<br>
The "push"  part here won't be that different - in the end, readers, writers<br>
and recommenders will all put their suggestions forward, and the final<br>
delivery<br>
will depend on the combination of all these filters.<br>
<p>
My usual arguments for the serendipity issue in filtering systems:<br>
<p>
<p>
1.   Ability to effectively choose among options is what constitutes the<br>
difference<br>
  between intelligence and lack of it.  So far, more intelligence usually<br>
has been useful.<br>
<p>
2.  Serendipity may be the best tool for finding occasional gems *in the<br>
absence*<br>
    of better mechanisms for finding these gems.  With much better mechanisms,<br>
   there won't be much use left for serendipity.<br>
<p>
3.  The same argument could have been suggested when people invented trains<br>
and cars.<br>
  "You can't wander around if you are on a road, and accidentally bump into<br>
nice people".<br>
  Sure.  If you want to wander, walk on foot.  Any technology is an<br>
instrument that has<br>
  limits of applicability.  Use it when you need it.  Nobody takes your<br>
other tools away.<br>
<p>
4.  Filtering, etc. can be used to *increase* serendipity.  Citing my own<br>
essay:<br>
<p>
"  The ACF methods should not necessarily be based on the straightforward<br>
matching<br>
of people's interests.  One group of people can be interested in materials<br>
that another<br>
group considers offensive or controversial; educators would pay special<br>
attention to<br>
things that students find too difficult or boring; researchers may be<br>
interested in problems<br>
that have puzzled their colleagues or have not received sufficient<br>
attention; social scientists<br>
and market analysts would study subjects experiencing rapid changes in<br>
levels of public<br>
interest or shifts of opinions; reviewers would look for new or unknown<br>
material in<br>
promising areas; fashion watchers may pay attention to things rising in<br>
popularity. "<br>
<p>
In other words, pushing and pulling agents can specify any criteria you<br>
want, including<br>
randomness, and get it.<br>
