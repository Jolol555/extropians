I think the passage referred to is from "For A New Liberty", by Rothbard,<br>
but I don't have it in front of me.  I do have a copy of "TANSTAAFL, The<br>
Economic Strategy For Environmental Crisis"(pg. 37), by Edwin G.<br>
Dolan,though, and it has a pertinent quote:<br>
<p>
"The second example for pollution control via the law of property has to do<br>
with the obscure corner of the legal system known as the law of nuisance. In<br>
our system property ownership includes the right to use free from outside<br>
interference, as well as the obligation to use is such a way as not to<br>
injure others.  Unfortunately, our system for enforcing the first right is<br>
faulty.  Our laws work pretty well in the area of private business.  If you<br>
build a barbecue in your back yard, and the smoke blows over and ruins the<br>
flavor of the cupcakes naked in the bakery next door, chances are you will<br>
be sued and have to pay damages.  These damage payments, or the threat of<br>
them, put a price on pollution for you and deter you from building the<br>
barbecue of using it as often as you otherwise would.<br>
<p>
In the area of law known as public nuisance, however, the system does not<br>
work nearly as well.  If the previous example is changed so that you are<br>
building a steel mill, and causing damage not only to your neighbor but to<br>
all the inhabitants of a forty-mile radius, you might imagine that the<br>
threat of suit and the imposition of damages would be still greater than<br>
before.  But it is ,less! This is because only an agency of the government<br>
is empowered to sue for public nuisance.  An individual cannot initiate a<br>
suit unless he can show special damages concentrated upon him alone...It is<br>
as if the law allowed you to defend yourself against a mugger who attacked<br>
only you, but did nothing to help if he robbed just a little from everyone<br>
in your neighborhood!"<br>
