The Australian historian Keith Windschuttle, mentioned recently here by<br>
Damien Broderick, has an essay entitled "The Real Stuff of History" in "The<br>
New Criterion" March 1997.  It is a tonic to see someone champion truth in<br>
history, the fact that only one thing happens at once, regardless of how<br>
many perspectives there are; and champion the incalculable role of the<br>
individual in shaping history, in direct opposition to academic historians'<br>
vogue of attributing history to quasi-deterministic forces out of the<br>
control of individuals.  He is an important voice in the academic<br>
wilderness providing reasoned ammo against the pervasive use of the word<br>
"inevitable" when making prognostications of how the future will unfold.<br>
<p>
When it comes to the recent rise of quasi-determinism, which was not<br>
"inevitable," the French, as usual, come in for some heavy blame.  This<br>
rise was not due to some mysterious historical force like class struggle,<br>
or geography, or climate, or genetic factors, or memetic transmission laws,<br>
but due to individuals, who can be named and held responsible for the<br>
messes their ideas have made of our contemporary world.<br>
<p>
Windschuttle begins with Fernand Braudel's conceiving of his famous book<br>
"The Mediterranean" (1949) while being held in a German prisoner of war<br>
camp.<br>
<p>
  "For the Frenchmen of his generation, this event, coupled with the German<br>
occupation of Paris without a shot being fired, plus the subsequent<br>
collaboration of France with the Nazi regime, was a source of humiliation<br>
and anguish.  The concept that most assisted Braudel to distance himself<br>
from these events was that of the 'longue durée,' the structuralist view of<br>
history.  Over the course of the longue durée, what did a transient event<br>
like the fall of France matter?"<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note the French response to cultural humiliation at<br>
the hands of the Germans was to deemphasize the role of the individual in<br>
history, essentially the socialistic response.  When the Germans, on the<br>
other hand, responded to cultural humiliation at the hands of the French<br>
during and after the Sun King's reign, they glorified the individual,<br>
initiating the powerful Romantic movement that still captivated Ayn Rand<br>
many years later.  Back to Windschuttle:<br>
<p>
  "In the wake of the war, [English] historians were keen to [modernize<br>
and] bury the last vestiges of the Victorian emphasis on the heroic<br>
individual, especially the chauvinist accounts of imperial heroes like<br>
Clive of India or Gordon of Khartoum that had dominated school textbooks as<br>
late as the 1930s....  Modernization also meant taking on board the work of<br>
the fast-growing field of economic history which had found that politics,<br>
especially in democratic societies, was more a matter of economic<br>
management than had previously been appreciated.  Up to the 1960s,<br>
anthropology and sociology were still intellectually respectable and some<br>
historians felt their own work should be more integrated with these and<br>
other social sciences.  Braudel showed them how all these aims could be<br>
pursued.  One of Braudel's most enthusiastic fan clubs was formed by the<br>
generation of Marxists who came to prominence in the 1960s, especially in<br>
Britain."<br>
<p>
No surprise to see English Marxists fall in with quasi-deterministic French<br>
socialists, they're still at it.  Note that Windschuttle correctly points<br>
out that anthropology and sociology have long lost their intellectual<br>
respectability.  The notion of "economic management" being important in the<br>
history of democratic societies was taken to the extreme in "The Sovereign<br>
Individual" (1997) by Rees-Mogg &amp; Davidson.  I guess these fads have to<br>
reach reductio ad absurdum before self-correction can occur.<br>
<p>
  "The academic Left of the 1960s... preferred Braudel's insistence on the<br>
irrelevance of individual action.  To [Louis] Althusser, individual men and<br>
women have no part in shaping their world.  They are merely the bearers of<br>
roles that are defined for them by the 'social formation,' little more than<br>
robots programmed by the prevailing capitalist ideology.  'Men do not make<br>
history,' [Braudel] wrote in the final passage of "The Identity of France",<br>
'rather it is history above all that makes men and absolves them of blame.'<br>
<p>
Well, isn't that special?  No wonder O.J. can bump his wife off, and the<br>
Menendez brothers can bump their parents off with impunity, heck, they're<br>
just subject to historical or social forces, no blame can stick.  The<br>
connection is crystal clear.<br>
<p>
  "In the wake of the failure of the attempted student revolutionary<br>
movement of 1968, and the attendant recall of Charles de Gaulle and<br>
election of Richard Nixon, this kind of historical determinism became a<br>
comfort blanket for the academic Left.  There was no longer any need for a<br>
radical to be politically active since activism could make no difference to<br>
the great determining structures.  All that remained was to study,<br>
theorize, and debate the nature of the structures themselves.  This was an<br>
agenda perfectly suited to the academic world of seminars, conferences,<br>
cafes, and bars, and to the careers, tenure, and promotions that have<br>
focused their minds ever since.  By the 1980s, the tenured radicals had<br>
dropped Marx and Althusser... but retained their structuralist baggage. <br>
Many looked to alternative gurus, notably the former French Marxists Jean<br>
Baudrillard and Jean François Lyotard, who preached postmodernism..."<br>
<p>
Truth hurts, and Windschuttle's account here of how our fine educational<br>
system ended up in its current conceptual sewer is very painful.  My tax<br>
dollars are going to universities which are bent on destroying the very<br>
possibility of successfully launching extropic cultures.  Grrr...<br>
<p>
Then Windschuttle talks about the writing of history itself, and why recent<br>
historians have taken to simply writing fictional stories embedded with<br>
thinly veiled political ideologies, instead of trying to get their facts<br>
straight and placing us within the individuals living during a given<br>
historical time in a given culture.<br>
<p>
  "The Dutch historian Peter Geyl emerged in the postwar academic world as<br>
one of the most widely read commentators on the discipline.  In particular,<br>
his books "Napoleon:  For and Against" (1949) and "Debates with Historians"<br>
(1955) were influential in establishing in the postwar mind the notion that<br>
there could be no final truths in history.  In 1961, Geyl's book on<br>
Napoleon was favorably acknowledged by the English historian E.H. Carr,<br>
author of "What is History?", one of the most influential commentaries on<br>
history writing ever published.  It was a required text in virtually every<br>
course on historical method in the English-speaking academic world for the<br>
next twenty years.  Carr repeats Geyl's argument that history is 'an<br>
unending dialogue between the present and the past.'  Different ages take<br>
different perspectives.  The best we can hope for is a continuous debate. <br>
While he says that historians should base their writing on facts, the real<br>
stuff of history is not truth but interpretation.  Carr was the author of a<br>
massive ten-volume study of the foundation of the USSR between 1917 and<br>
1929 but, until his death in 1982, had remained a closet Marxist."<br>
<p>
The massive Soviet penetration of our history departments, especially in<br>
the departments that churned out history teachers by the bushel, should<br>
come as no surprise to those who remember the communist axiom that those<br>
who would shape the future must control the past.  It is also obvious why<br>
Nietzsche, who wrote from the right, was picked up and sanitized by the<br>
left who have never had a lick of respect for the truth.  Nietzsche asked<br>
for this misbegotten adoption, which would've repulsed him, by being too<br>
clever by a half in pushing Western civilization further into nihilism,<br>
faster, in order for it to discover an antidote to nihilism quickly, by<br>
emphasizing interpretation over truth himself.  "Oh, the tangled webs we<br>
weave..."<br>
<p>
But when truth is thrown out the door, as Gregory Houston recently did<br>
here, then lies and propaganda walk in, such as denying the Holocaust ever<br>
took place.<br>
<p>
  "One of the consequences of the relativist position is that it cedes some<br>
degree of credibility to anyone with an even vaguely coherent perspective,<br>
no matter how vile it might be.  The consequence of the position that there<br>
can be no absolute truths is that there can be no absolute falsehoods<br>
either, so refutation ('prove the falsehood of') is beyond reach."<br>
<p>
All too true, but there is a proper method of history, if the notion of<br>
truth is not thrown out.<br>
<p>
  "For every corroboration, there increases in geometric proportion the<br>
probability that this event actually occurred.  Since we live in a finite<br>
world, there comes a point where it is impossible for any scenario to exist<br>
in which the Holocaust did not occur.  Every fact can itself be a<br>
conclusion and every conclusion can itself be a fact in someone else's<br>
explanation."<br>
<p>
Windschuttle then dares to skewer the whole premise of multiculturalism,<br>
the notion that all cultures deserve equal consideration.  We wouldn't even<br>
be examining the history of other cultures if it weren't for Western<br>
civilization's interest in them.  Other cultures didn't record their own<br>
history, they saw no reason to.<br>
<p>
  "History is an invention of Western culture, dating from ancient Greece<br>
in the fifth century B.C., and since then its practice has been confined<br>
almost entirely to the West.  Yet for all this time, there have been two<br>
traditions of history contesting the field.  One derives from the first<br>
genuine historian, Thucydides.  In the "Oxford Illustrated History of<br>
Christianity" (1990), John McManners has argued that in the implications of<br>
Christian belief there are encouragements to writing history in an austere,<br>
uncommitted fashion, with wide cultural concern:  'Firstly, there was the<br>
conviction that everything men do or think matters intensely and eternally,<br>
as coming under the judgment of God; secondly, there was the concept of a<br>
creator entirely distinct from his creation, ruling the universe by general<br>
laws, whose ways are inscrutable, and who gives men the gift of freedom. <br>
Hence the obligation to treat seriously and with reverence all men and the<br>
social orders they build, to study everything, to explain without<br>
partisanship, insisting on the logical coherence of all things.'  From the<br>
fall of Rome to the Renaissance, the idea of history was kept alive in the<br>
industry of those many Christian monks whose chronicles of church and state<br>
were imbued with ideals of this kind."<br>
<p>
Other cultures did not have such ideals, did not take the individual<br>
seriously.  The notion of the importance of the individual was a Western<br>
idea.<br>
<p>
  "Christianity, however, bore an additional dimension that in the last two<br>
centuries has produced a second tradition within history.  Christianity has<br>
held that, while the achievements of man are due to his own will and<br>
intellect, they are also beholden to something other than himself, the<br>
realizing of God's purposes for man.  From this perspective, men are the<br>
vehicles through which history occurs but history has a direction and a<br>
purpose decided by a force beyond man.  This Christian concept of history<br>
also contained the idea of fulfillment.  It is this second Christian<br>
tradition that has formed the basis of those theories of history that<br>
conjure up great impersonal forces and undercurrents which purportedly<br>
determine the destiny of mankind."<br>
<p>
This split within Christianity between the two traditions is mirrored in<br>
the split between ascetic Christianity, essentially entropic in nature, and<br>
joyous Christianity, essentially extropic in nature.  The tension between<br>
the rival traditions within Western civilization helped forge the pluralism<br>
and ideal of toleration that underpins notions of liberty, freedom and<br>
capitalism, and is a unique reason why none of those notions arose anywhere<br>
else on earth.<br>
<p>
Windschuttle sums up by emphasizing the individual's role in history, an<br>
extropic formulation:<br>
<p>
  "Rather than human affairs being impelled by great impersonal forces,<br>
political history reveals our world to be made by men and, instead of being<br>
'absolved of blame,' men are responsible for the consequences of their<br>
actions."<br>
