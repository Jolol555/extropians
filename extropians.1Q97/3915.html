<i>&gt;                 THE CRIMINALITY OF PATENT AND COPYRIGHT LAWS</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                             by Benjamin Tucker</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The laws of Patent and Copyright are the means by which the State, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; greatest of criminal and tyranical monopolies, grants special monopolistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; privileges to a few at the expense of the many by protecting inventors and</i><br>
<i>&gt; authors against competition for a period long enough to enable them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labour measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; of their services. The abolition of these monopolies would fill their</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficiaries with a wholesome fear of competition which would cause them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be satisfied with pay for their services equal to that which other labourers</i><br>
<i>&gt; get for theirs, and to secure it by placing their products and works on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; market at the outset at prices so low that their lines of business would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; no more tempting to competitors than any other lines.</i><br>
<p>
If inventors produced intellectual property at the same rate as a<br>
production worker produced cars, we would obviously need to make this<br>
comparison. Unfortunately, inventions are rare beasts, coming few and<br>
far between, after much research, thought, and study. The writer has<br>
obviously never invented a thing, or he would realize that while the<br>
breakthrough "Eureka" may be momentary, there is a long series of hours,<br>
days, and weeks spent preparing the mind to make such acheivements. If<br>
we account for these, we would see that, while the inventor still may be<br>
highly paid for his or her invention, it would still be in line with<br>
other professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers. That inventors are<br>
few and far between, and their inventions even rarer, if we assume a<br>
free market based on relative scarcity, inventions are fairly<br>
compensated for. For example: There have been approximately 5.5 million<br>
inventions patented in the US in it entire history (mostly during<br>
periods when patent rights are vigorously enforced, hint hint) while<br>
laborers have worked approximately 25 x 10^13 hours in US history. This<br>
means that in fair market value, the average invention is equal to 4.55<br>
million man hours of physical labor in relative scarcity. If we value<br>
the average man hour at as little as $1.00 per hour (which was typical<br>
for the turn of the century, never mind that 2/3 of all workers have<br>
lived since that time) we see that the fair market value for an average<br>
invention is $4.55 million dollars. <br>
<p>
Any responses to this quoting communist rhetoric and I will puke.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Patent and Copyright monopolies are a species of property rights which</i><br>
<i>&gt; depend for their legitimacy on the subtle notion of "property in ideas". The</i><br>
<i>&gt; defenders of such property set up an analogy between the production of</i><br>
<i>&gt; material things and the production of abstractions, and on the strength of</i><br>
<i>&gt; it declare that the manufacturer of mental products, no less than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacturer of material products, is a labourer worthy of his hire. So far,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so good. But, to make out their case, they are obliged to go further, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; claim, in violation of their own analogy, that the labourer who creates</i><br>
<i>&gt; mental products, unlike the labourer who creates material products, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; entitled to exemption from competition. Because the Lord, in his wisdom, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Devil, in his malice, has so arranged matters that the inventor and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; author produce naturally at a disadvantage, man, in his might, proposes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; supply the devine or diabloic deficiency by an artificial arrangement that</i><br>
<i>&gt; shall not only destroy this disadvantage, but actually give the inventor and</i><br>
<i>&gt; author an advantage that no labourer enjoys, - an advantage, moreover, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; in practice, goes, not to the inventor and the author, but to the promoter</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the publisher and the monopolist.</i><br>
<p>
The fallacy in this argument is that someone who simply copies another's<br>
invention is worthy of being called "competition" rather than being<br>
called what he is: a theif.<br>
<p>
That the majority of profit for an invention tends to go to the<br>
promoter, publisher, or monopolist rather than the inventor is merely<br>
indication of the corrupting influence such disparate levels of<br>
preexisting power do to equal human rights, and why such legal remedies<br>
for the average person is needed. If this were not the case, over 90% of<br>
inventions would not occur, as they are invented by people with little<br>
personal means. They sacrifice the majority of potential profits because<br>
the are not able to accept the attendant risk involved, and sell out to<br>
attain greater security, but that is a different issue not germain to<br>
this argument excpet for this point.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Convincing as the argument for property in ideas may seem at first hearing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you think about it long enough, you will begin to be supicious. The first</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing, perhaps, to arouse your suspicion will be the fact that none of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; champions of such property propose the punishment of those who violate it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; contenting themselves with subjecting the offenders to the risk of damage</i><br>
<i>&gt; suits, and that nearly all of them are willing that even the risk of suit</i><br>
<i>&gt; shall disappear when the proprietor has enjoyed his right for a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of years. Now, if, as the French writer, Alphonse Karr, remarked,</i><br>
<i>&gt; property in ideas is a property like any other property, then its violation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the violation of any other property, deserves criminal punishment, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; its life, like that of any other property, should be secure in right against</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lapse of time. And, this not being claimed by the upholders of property</i><br>
<i>&gt; in ideas, the suspicion arises that such a lack of the courage of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; conviction may be due to an instinctive feeling that they are wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Here is another broken logic chain. Here the anarchist writer is quoting<br>
a statist frenchman, advocating government solution. If we are to follow<br>
the writers prior arguments, we would use labor law as a basis, and see<br>
that all labor disputes are civil matters, where fines and compensation<br>
are the norm, much like intellectual proporty disputes.<br>
<p>
That workers earn pensions that pay after they retire from labor<br>
indicates that even laborers earn a royalty on their work (while they<br>
are partial contributors, their employer tends to pay the most).<br>
<p>
As for the expiration of patent rights, I as this: parental rights<br>
expire after 17 years, jsut as patent rights did prior to the GATT<br>
treaty. As to my original arguments, creative capabilities, and the<br>
recognised rights that protect them, of any kind, are irrevocably bound<br>
up in each other. That the founders recognised this connection is<br>
inherent in the regs stating such equal dates of expiry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I take it that, if it were possible, and if it had always been possible, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unlimited number of individuals to use to an unlimited extent and in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; unlimited number of places the same concrete things at the same time, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; never would have been any such thing as the institution of property. Under</i><br>
<i>&gt; those circumstances the idea of property would never have entered the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind, or, at any rate, if it had, would have been summarily dismissed as too</i><br>
<i>&gt; gross an absurdity to be seriously entertained for a moment. Had it been</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible for the concrete creation or adaptation  resulting from the efforts</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a single individual to be used contemporaneously by all individuals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including the creator or adapter, the realization, or impending realization,</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this possiblity, far from being seized upon as an excuse for a law to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent the use of this concrete thing without the consent of its creator or</i><br>
<i>&gt; adapter, and far from being guarded against as an injury to one, would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been welcomed as a blessing to all,- in short, would have been viewed as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; most fortunate element in the nature of things. The raison d'etre of</i><br>
<i>&gt; property is found in the very fact that there is no such possiblity,- in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that it is impossible in the nature of things for concrete objects to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be used in different places at the same time. This fact existing, no person</i><br>
<i>&gt; can remove from another's possession and take to his use another's concrete</i><br>
<i>&gt; creation without thereby depriving that other of all opportunity to use that</i><br>
<i>&gt; which he created, and for this reason it became socially necessary, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; successful society rests on individual initiative, to protect the individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; creator in the use of his concrete creations by forbidding others to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; them without his consent. In other words, it became necessary to institute</i><br>
<i>&gt; property in concrete things.</i><br>
<p>
THis argument is to assume that there is only one plow in the entire<br>
world, and one car, one ship, one computer, etc. That copies of products<br>
can be produced and sold is indication of the fallacy of these claims.<br>
WHat the writer is trying to do is equate ALL property under the<br>
restrictions inherent on one form of property known as REAL ESTATE,<br>
because real estate cannot be reproduced, it can only be divided, it<br>
cannot be multiplied, at least on this planet. This is the central<br>
fallacy of this entire argument, and voids it. These arguments on the<br>
part of the writer are extremely entropian.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perpetual property in ideas, then, which is the logical outcome of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory of property in abstract things, would, had it been in force in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; lifetime of James Watt, have made his direct heirs the owners of at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; nine-tenths of the now existing wealth of the world; and had it been in</i><br>
<i>&gt; force in the lifetime of the inventor of the Roman alphabet, nearly all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly civilized peoples of the earth would be today the virtual slaves of</i><br>
<i>&gt; that inventor's heirs, which is but another way of saying that, instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; becoming highly civilized, they would have remained in the state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; semi-barbarism. It seems to me that these two statements, which in my view</i><br>
<i>&gt; are incontrovertible, are in themselves sufficient to condemn property in</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas forever.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, and this is why there are no perpetual intellectual property<br>
laws, much as parents cannot have perpetual rule over their children.<br>
