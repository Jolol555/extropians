From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; I just read about it in scientific american. What it does is polarize a</i><br>
<i>&gt; laser beam, split the beam, and put one of the splits through a</i><br>
<i>&gt; polarizer at 45 deg from the first, plus some other steps I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember, but basically it allows one to observe without influencing.</i><br>
<p>
I read that article too, and although it was truly a remarkable result it<br>
would not lead to faster than light communication.<br>
<p>
What the article describes is a method to determine whether a photon<br>
path is blocked or not, while reducing the photon flux in that path to<br>
an arbitrarily small amount.  It uses quantum interference to determine<br>
whether a photon might have gone down that path, even though no photons<br>
ever actually do go that way.<br>
<p>
Theoretically you could scan the photon path across an object and<br>
take a picture of it, without actually hitting it with any photons.<br>
If X-rays could be manipulated optically as easily as visible-light<br>
photons, you could take an X-ray photo of a specimen without exposing<br>
it to damaging X-ray radiation.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what would be needed for faster than light communication, but<br>
this isn't it.<br>
