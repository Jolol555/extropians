<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Art is a discourse, and the creators of Extropic Art act as a voice for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Extropianism;</i><br>
<p>
There are many extropian voices:<br>
<p>
Dr. Ralph Merkle is a voice for his views about extreme life extension, he<br>
is also an extropian. Yet, some extropians are not cryonicists.  Dr. Roy<br>
Walford acts as a voice for low-caloric intake. Some extropians are not<br>
slender, but Roy is an extropian. Hans Morovec is an extropian and also acts<br>
as a voice for robotics. Some extropians think his work is science fiction,<br>
rather than fact.  Minksy is an extropian. He is the "father" of AI, not<br>
neural networks.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;indeed, they may define Extropianism. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I disagree.  I have never heard of a philosophy, a movement, or a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;religion that has been defined by its artists or by their artwork.</i><br>
<p>
Extropic Artists act as a voice for their own individual extropic<br>
creativity. (Extropy has been defined by Max More.)<br>
<p>
(Kathryn)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;To make artists definers or cheerleaders..</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I created art-work</i><br>
<i>&gt;showing graphic and cruel vivisection, called myself an Extropian artist</i><br>
<i>&gt;and displayed all over Britain</i><br>
<p>
You would not be an Extropic Artist unless the work was produced to provoke<br>
an extropic view of such vivisection. <br>
<p>
There are many people who make false claims about who they are, from art to<br>
politics to science. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A piece of artwork cannot challenge generic 'assumptions'. It can only</i><br>
<i>&gt;challenge the particular assumptions of its audience. Very few people have</i><br>
<i>&gt;any assumptions at all about Extropianism,</i><br>
<p>
This is not accurate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;so artwork has the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create, rather than challenge, any assumptions about Extropy.</i><br>
<p>
According to the defection of Extropic Art, the art is extropic.  Basic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another</i><br>
<i>&gt;example: if I paint a series of pictures showing Max wearing flowing robes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in front of a cross,</i><br>
<p>
I don't think Max would buy it -:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;may not see the imagery, but that's my point exactly.)</i><br>
<p>
And, thus, a reason for words.  <br>
<p>
This point is interesting, but doesn't hold because extropianism is not a<br>
stand-alone.  One venue does not have a monopoly on extropian ideas. Nor<br>
will it.  Simultaneously, books are written about extropy, articles about<br>
extropy and extropians appear in widely read magazines and newspapers, BBC<br>
and PBS films appear on TV with extropians, films with extropians,  poems<br>
about extropy, plays, conferences, technologies, ways of thinking, and so<br>
forth. <br>
