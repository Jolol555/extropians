Maybe I should put some kind of parental warning at the beginning of <br>
my posts.  This one is rated R, meaning it contains Real, nonfictional <br>
characters.  There really was a Jennifer.  Still is, I guess.  However, <br>
certain statements below may contain slight exaggerations.  Now you <br>
have been fairly warned!  <br>
<p>
Crossing over to another thread for a moment, instead of posing the <br>
question "What is reality?" it is more useful to consider this question:  <br>
"How do you tell what's real and what isn't?"  Specifically with regard <br>
to stories:  how do you tell when somebody is putting you on?  I have <br>
been known to yank people's chains, most recently in the Lyle's Laws <br>
post on New Year's Eve.  How many of you knew that I wasn't serious <br>
about the stock market going up exponentially?  If you knew, what <br>
gave it away?   How many of you knew that Leslie was *not* fictional?  <br>
What about memories -- how can you tell if memories of reincarnation <br>
are real or not?  <br>
<p>
Now, finally getting to my point about women:  <br>
<p>
Jennifer was the most beautiful girl I ever knew -- the most perfect <br>
embodiment of Venus.   She looked kind of like Michelle Pfeiffer, but <br>
her face was a little fuller.  Imagine a combination of Pfeiffer with Liv <br>
Ulman.  Honey blonde hair, eyes that changed color from blue to green <br>
to grey to purple, always clear and beautiful.  And the rest of her, <br>
I won't try to describe on a family-oriented list.  She didn't own a bra, <br>
and wore tight cut-off jeans... she knew exactly what she was doing, <br>
and she enjoyed it tremendously.  She loved being Venus.   <br>
<p>
She took four years of math in high school, and made straight A's. <br>
When I met her, she was the bookkeeper in a macrobiotic bakery.  <br>
In other words, she had some natural talent for math.  If she had been <br>
force-fed mathematics from day one, and browbeaten into going to <br>
college instead of being a health-food hippie, she might have been an <br>
excellent mathematician, comparable to Emmy Noether.  She might <br>
have been as good at math as the Polgar sisters are at chess.    <br>
<p>
But then, would she still be Venus?  Her features would be more or less <br>
the same, I suppose (although I think studying mathematics changes us <br>
physically, roo).  But if she were a mathematician, would she still have <br>
the same glow, the same warmth, the same sparkle, the same musical <br>
lilt in her voice, the same loose-limbed walk, the same laugh, the same <br>
sexual heat?  <br>
<p>
When Jennifer walked down the street, young men fought each other, <br>
old men had heart attacks, bushes caught fire if she walked too close to <br>
them -- this girl was hot.  She gave algebra no more attention than the <br>
alphabet.  She didn't think, feel, act, or walk like a mathematician.  <br>
She had nothing in common with Newton.  If she did, she wouldn't be <br>
the Jennifer I knew.  She would be Juno or Athena or Diana, not Venus.  <br>
<p>
When Nell Stephenson walked down the street, no one noticed.  If Nell <br>
looked like Jennifer -- a difficult juxtaposition to imagine -- then what?  <br>
Would she attract the same attention?  Probably not.  <br>
<p>
One time somebody said something about women being equal to men, <br>
and Jennifer said "That doesn't mean everybody has to be alike."  <br>
She was doing what she wanted to do with her life.  She didn't want <br>
to be Juno.  She wanted to be Venus.  She shouldn't be forced to be the <br>
New Communist Woman, or the New Capitalist Woman, or whatever.  <br>
Let her be what she wants to be.  She does what she does, supremely <br>
well.  Let her do it.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
