<i>&gt;  Illogical.  I think it has been a waste of my time communicating with you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I am sorry spending so much time working on this.  It is a lesson for me, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; let other people alone, especially if they appear to have already made up</i><br>
<i>&gt; their minds, because, in that case, logic and written documentation is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough. </i><br>
<p>
No!  No!  Don't do that.  You're forgetting about us lurkers, and making<br>
the same mistake as some of those who argued against my earlier thread<br>
on the value of rudeness: you are assuming that the purpose of argument<br>
is to sway one's opponent.  That may be one goal of some arguments, but<br>
the /purpose/ of argument is to clarify the truth for one's own benefit,<br>
and in a public forum like this, for everyone's.<br>
<p>
Your opponents initial claims were interesting, and I might have been<br>
inclined to investigate them.  Though I generally felt that Duesberg<br>
was a quack, I was not unwilling to listen to argument otherwise.  Your<br>
wonderful job of exposing the case for what it is, and his subsequent<br>
obvious evasion, clarify the issue for me greatly.  Evasion is easy to<br>
recognize when you see it, but crackpots won't resort to it until<br>
someone brings up enough facts to push them to it. <br>
<p>
Your argument has not failed; it has succeeded brilliantly, just not<br>
in the mind of your opponent.  But who cares about him?<br>
