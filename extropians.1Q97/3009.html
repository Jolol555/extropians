&lt;&lt;( M.Lorrey) &gt;Extended lifespans only stretch out the time to confiscation,<br>
allowing<br>
<i> &gt;greater capital appreciation. As an example, Bill Gates has publicly</i><br>
<i> &gt;stated that he plans on giving all of his wealth away by the time he</i><br>
<i> &gt;dies.</i><br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;I'm not sure in what context Gates stated this (i.e., flip or a sudden<br>
<i> &gt;stroke of altruism.)  Also, he could reconsider his current views on death,</i><br>
<i> &gt;in which case he would then reconsider giving away *all* his money.  If</i><br>
<i> &gt;comes to the conclusion that death is not necessary - valuing living</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt; indefinitely; he just might invest his money in extending lifespans. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It would be interesting indeed, if a huge money player got involved in<br>
immortalist research. I remember in R.A.Wilson's book,'Schroedinger's Cat',<br>
 the president offered a huge sum of money to anyone who could extend life or<br>
find a cure for death and it happened really quickly. It is always surprising<br>
to me that in a country that spends over a billion a year billion on<br>
cosmetics to make us look young and beautiful, no one really bigtime wants to<br>
fund cryonics or longevity research...<br>
It's intrinsic value seems so damned OBVIOUS to me...<br>
