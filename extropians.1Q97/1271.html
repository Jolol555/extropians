Hi all.<br>
<p>
<p>
So I've been reading and trying to "grok" things on this list.  Seems to be=<br>
 a lot of incredibly intelligent and well evolved critters on this list, and=<br>
 I hope to gain a lot by being here, towards my own "self-actualization" as=<br>
 it were. And hopefully I will be able to contribute something of value as=<br>
 well, to others evolvement.<br>
<p>
<p>
I just came from the extropy website, and have a much better understanding=<br>
 of what this all means.  Actually it is very much in alignment with the=<br>
 Church I belong to.  (Hummer watches various people faint and fall on the=<br>
 ground in disbelief from the word "Church" ;&gt; )<br>
<p>
<p>
Well it's the Church of All Worlds to be exact, drawn from SISL, so it's=<br>
 slightly different. (<a href="http://www.caw.org">http://www.caw.org</a>).  Our concept of Divinity is=<br>
 immanent, so we don't *neccesarily* fall into the trap of dogma or=<br>
 mysticism, (in fact it is one of the things we strive to get away from,=<br>
 that and hypocricy), we are an experential Church, that happens to worship=<br>
 Gaia (and by worship I mean ecstatic embrace) as our Mother, and we are a=<br>
 part of Her and she is a part of the the overall Divinity...it's immanent.=<br>
 :)<br>
<p>
<p>
I find myself in about 85% agreement with extropianism, in about 15%=<br>
 disagreement. So from the definition of extropianism, I guess I fit into=<br>
 this meme.  :)   I can't understand the complete and utter rejection of=<br>
 such things as Shamanic or spiritual experience...I don't understand why=<br>
 technology and those experiences can't be integrated.    Spirituality=<br>
 doesn't *have* to mean dogmatism, etc....to me spirituality is a personal=<br>
 experience with the ecstasy of life.  I have deep experiences which connect=<br>
 me with that ecstatic embrace, I would hate to loose it all to the cold,=<br>
 technological world. Embracing a redwood, feeling tadpoles nibble at my=<br>
 toes, dancing, ritual, etc, all have value in that they take us out of the=<br>
 mundane and get us in touch with what it is I think you all seem to desire,=<br>
 and embrace with what is real, ecstatic, transhuman.<br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not a luddite by any stretch....just so you don't misunderstand me...nor=<br>
 am I a hippie dippie white light nazi...I sell brain machines to accelerate=<br>
 consciousness (<a href="http://www.brainboutique.com">http://www.brainboutique.com</a>  --- under construction, a more=<br>
 developed site is <a href="http://www.cruzio.com/~hummer/brainboutique">http://www.cruzio.com/~hummer/brainboutique</a>, but still=<br>
 not perfect, email me with questions), I do web design because I feel this=<br>
 is a way to reach out to create connections through the world, I'm=<br>
 completely comitted to the ideals of better living through intelligent=<br>
 technology and being an environmentalist (used to work for the Envionmental=<br>
 Defense Fund), I feel that since technology got us into this mess,=<br>
 technology is the only way to get us out of this mess.  I take the latest=<br>
 biotechnologically produced nutraceuticals which can only be created=<br>
 through the use of technology...to extend my life.  I don't wish to be=<br>
 immortal (because I feel that death is a part of the circle of life), but I=<br>
 do wish to have an extended life to accomplish and experience as much as=<br>
 possible now.  I do believe in reincarnation, if for no other reason=<br>
 (though there are many others) that I have active waking memories that=<br>
 spontaneously occured, unbidden. =20<br>
<p>
<p>
I am at a bit of cusp with this list...   not being mathematically inclined,=<br>
 some of the topics fly right over my head or beside me in both lanes=<br>
 (Hummer does a clueless moose imitation).  I'm not intimidated, I am just=<br>
 not interested (nor am I ashamed for not knowing, I just have a much more=<br>
 creative/circular mind than a linear mind!).  This list seems to epitomize=<br>
 my spirituality without embodying it.  It's interesting for me to see that.=<br>
  I agree with most of the ideas of extropianism....completely, but I feel=<br>
 that the way to evolve is to connect with deity within ourselves and all=<br>
 around us...because I feel that Divinity is evolving just as we are.  So=<br>
 therefore S/He is not something ruling it over us.<br>
<p>
<p>
Maybe I'm pathetically naive....<br>
<p>
<p>
but at least this resonates.<br>
<p>
<p>
Anyway, hello all, and I hope to resonate better with you!<br>
