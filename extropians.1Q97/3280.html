Five-person pregnancy sparks debate in Italy<br>

ROME (Mar 7, 1997 10:19 a.m. EST) - An Italian woman provoked a storm of<br>
outrage Friday with the news that she is acting as a surrogate mother and<br>
expecting two boys in a pregnancy involving five people.<br>
<p>
Gynaecologist Pasquale Bilotta said on Thursday that he had implanted two<br>
eggs from different women and fertilized by separate men in the surrogate<br>
mother.<br>
<p>
He said both female donors were Italian. The surrogate mother, identified<br>
only as "Angela," was three months pregnant.<br>
<p>
Health Minister Rosy Bindi, who this week announced a temporary ban in<br>
Italy on all forms of human and animal experimentation linked to cloning,<br>
was aghast.<br>
<p>
"We have crossed unimaginable boundaries," she said.<br>
<p>
Bilotta said that the operation was carried out in Switzerland because the<br>
Italian medical body forbids surrogate motherhood in its professional code<br>
of conduct although there is no legal ban on the practice.<br>
<p>
Aldo Pagni, the president of the country's medical order, said the fact<br>
that Bilotta had gone abroad did not absolve him and he should face<br>
sanctions in Italy. He also called for government legislation to prevent<br>
future cases.<br>
<p>
Father Gino Concetti, a Roman Catholic moral theologian whose views are<br>
close to those of Pope John Paul, said the pregnancy was "a new step toward<br>
madness" and urged a ban.<br>
<p>
He said surrogate motherhood was "a blatant violation of natural maternity<br>
and a grave offence against personal dignity which calls for conception in<br>
a dignified manner and by natural means by a couple united in regular<br>
matrimony."<br>
<p>
The Catholic Church opposes all forms of artificial human conception,<br>
including test-tube fertilization and surrogate motherhood, as well as<br>
experimentation on embryos.<br>
<p>
"Two children are being born as the offspring of five adults, of two<br>
fathers and three mothers. Here the whole concept of the family, of<br>
brothers and of twins has been blown to pieces," La Stampa newspaper=<br>
 declared.<br>
<p>
"They are children of science and that is it."<br>
<p>
"Angela," a mother of two children aged eight and 10, told newspapers that<br>
she had decided to help two childless women "out of love" and was not being<br>
paid anything more than her expenses.<br>
<p>
"It is an act of humanity," she said, adding that after the birth she did<br>
not want to see the babies and had not wanted information about the parents.<br>
<p>
She said she was a Roman Catholic but had no difficulties in reconciling<br>
her faith and her decision.<br>
<p>
"The Church can say what it wants. I remain a Catholic, I believe in God<br>
and don't understand why a person should be condemned for trying to help<br>
others," she told the Rome daily La Repubblica.<br>
<p>
The only ethically unacceptable thing would have been to take money for<br>
what she was doing, she declared.<br>
<p>
The reaction was not all completely hostile.<br>
<p>
Rosanna Della Corte, an Italian who had a test-tube baby at the age of 62<br>
in 1994 in a case that caused a similar storm, said the case of "Angela"<br>
was a beautiful miracle of science although she opposed surrogacy.<br>
<p>
"A woman is not a machine, she is a mother," she said. "If I were that<br>
woman in Rome, once the babies were born I would keep them rather than hand<br>
them over."<br>
