<i>&gt; For the classic "lake of sulfer" scenario, you'd need powerful</i><br>

<p>
"Hell must be isothermal, for otherwise the resident engineers could use <br>
the temperature differential to cool off a part of it to any desired <br>
temperature" (Old physics joke).<br>
<p>
Molten sulphur isn't that hot, just a few hundred degrees centigrade, so <br>
a research station (suitably insulated, chemically inert and linked by a <br>
cooling system to the Ninth circle) would certainly work. Infernal <br>
sulphur-based biology might be fascinating (or is it a branch of <br>
demonology? Demonochemistry?). <br>
<p>
An oceania-like floating structure might work, but the fumes above the <br>
lake are definitely unhealthy, But by enclosing it in a geodesic dome and <br>
extracting energy from burning sulphur, you could probably create a real <br>
paradise inside. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would there be any motive for colonizing hell?  My copy of *Inferno*</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't show much in the way of natural resources.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, skilled labor? There must be a lot of useful people down there (and<br>
lawyers, politicians and priests of course :-) Research has already been<br>
mentioned. Interesting minerals might be present. Besides, according to<br>
all accounts *nobody ever dies in hell*! This would provide a very unusual<br>
life extension method: "Want to live forever? Live in hell!" <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What would be required to terraform Hell?  Since Hell is infinite (?) it</i><br>
<i>&gt; beats a Dyson sphere for living space, and in any case I think that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; should do our best to ensure a happy afterlife even for the morally</i><br>
<i>&gt; challenged.  I believe that the flatterers were supposed to be wading</i><br>
<i>&gt; through excrement, so we have plenty of fertilizer.  The classic problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; of producing oxygen doesn't apply; what we need is to give Hell a</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-sustaining livable ecology.  Are there any plants that put roots</i><br>
<i>&gt; down in molten sulfer?  If the sulfer is self-heating, or the plain of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ice is self-cooling, we can drop chunks of ice into the lake - the</i><br>
<i>&gt; question remains; what will live on even cooled sulfur?</i><br>
<p>
I think the classic vision of Hell includes some ecology (the forest of <br>
the suicides?), but most seems to consist of neatly divided regions with <br>
very different chemistries. Mixing the right areas together could result <br>
in very useful results. The best way might be to start out with building <br>
an infrastructure, moving the flatterers into the first circle so that <br>
their circle could be mined and seeded. <br>
<p>
Somehow I have the feeling it is easier to build small biospheres inside <br>
hell than terraform the whole thing; as Piers Anthony wrote in his <br>
occasionally hilarious _For Love of Evil_: "Changing Hell was like boxing <br>
with a big pillow; you made an impression, but it didn't change anything".<br>
<p>
Besides, we have forgotten how to deal with the demons. What rights do <br>
they have to their natural environment? <br>
