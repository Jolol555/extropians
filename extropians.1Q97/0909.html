I'm new to the Extropian movement, but I like it.  I've enjoyed and<br>
generally agreed with most of what comes out of the Extropy Institute,<br>
and I'm readily becoming attached to its principles.<br>
<p>
However, I have a problem.  If it's not appropriate for this list, tell<br>
me so, and I'll take the conversation elsewhere.<br>
<p>
The Extropy Institute has a philosophy which strives towards spontaneous<br>
order through decentralized systems.  It denies dogma in favor of<br>
healthy criticism.  It's a far more open system than any religion or<br>
fundamentalist philosophy.  I like that.  However, it's been painfully<br>
obvious to me, throughout my life, how far people can get when they're<br>
dogmatically committed towards a particular idea.  Ideas like bigotry,<br>
fascism and censorship are incredibly rampant because they develop a<br>
devoted and unquestioning following.  The masses flock to their<br>
shepherd.  They're insanely bad memes, but problematically trong:<br>
if people are more powerful when they are fundamentally committed<br>
and when surrounded by people who agree with them, then they'll adapt<br>
as is most advantageous to them:  conform, centralize, dogmatize.<br>
<p>
I don't like any of this.  But this has been a problem that I've been<br>
fighting with for most of my life.  I'm not here to argue that religion<br>
is better than healthy criticism and spontaneous order.  I don't think<br>
that.  But in the face of what's out there, how can I, and others like<br>
me, fight a meme of centralization which may be fundamentally more<br>
powerful than the one I'm trying to spread, simply by virtue of the fact<br>
that the meme I'm spreading can never be a dogma?  Can this meme ever<br>
surpass authoritarianism?<br>
<p>
I hope no one looks at this as trying to pick a fight... that's not what<br>
I'm doing.  I'm trying to find some more hope so I can get that dynamic<br>
optimism in line.<br>
<p>
If anybody has any comments for me, even if it's to tell me to leave the<br>
mailing list, I'm open.<br>
