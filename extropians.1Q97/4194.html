If it was like imagination then the vision program would be able to<br>
change what it was trying to see. Since the images come from outside<br>
the program (perhaps they were generated years ago by another computer<br>
and are merely stored on disk), they are an objective feature of the<br>
program's world. It is not at all like imagination.<br>

If it looks like it is walking (it moves around its world) and thinks<br>
it is walking, then what is the difference? I suppose you could define <br>
"walking" narrowly enough to exclude what the simulated cockroach is <br>
doing, but that is like saying computers don't do math until the results <br>
are printed on paper.<br>
