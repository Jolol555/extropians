<i>&gt;&gt; [SNIP]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Though it is difficult to see out of context, the quote above was a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rhetorical question, but I appreciate your response none the less.</i><br>
<p>
That's OK, it was a rhetorical reply ;-)<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; However, since we can't step outside ourselves to check words against</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reality, when we call something true that means we *conjecture* it to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So we are saying one thing, but we means something *slightly* different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is one of my difficulties with the term truth, by definition it</i><br>
<i>&gt;does not include this element of conjecture or skepticism. By definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is absolute, and not particularly questionable. Do you not imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we might come up with a better term for what we are talking about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;One which is a bit more accurate or *true* [to use the term loosely].</i><br>
<i>&gt;The dictionary definition of truth is not entirely consistent with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;manner in which it is being used by science. Would it not make more</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense to create a more accurate word ... and then while doing so,</i><br>
<i>&gt;questioning all the priorities which truth and the new word both entail.</i><br>
<p>
I think the confusion lies in thinking that the definition of truth<br>
gives us some understanding of how to test for truth.  As I said above,<br>
it does nothing of the kind.  We test for truth by more or less<br>
pragmatic or Popperian methods.  The definition of truth stipulates an<br>
*ideal* scenario.  It defines what we *want*.  It doesn't help us to get<br>
there.  (That much of the hullaballoo against truth this century is<br>
correct. But to ditch truth as a concept, an ideal, is to throw the baby<br>
out with the bathwater.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I like the word conjecture. It is derived from "com" which means</i><br>
<i>&gt;"together", and "jacere" which means "to throw"; to throw together. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;term conjecture seems much more dynamic than that of truth, which seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;extremely static. Perhaps the word "conjection" would be more suitable.</i><br>
<p>
Conjecture and truth are not in competition: everything that we have<br>
that we *call* truth we *conjecture* to be truth in the ideal sense.  I<br>
really don't see what's so difficult or problematic about this.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
[interesting discussion of 'conjecture' and new coinage of 'conjection'<br>
snipped]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe these terms or terms created with similar meaning, would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;more suitable to PCR. </i><br>
<p>
I don't: it seems needlessly complicated.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't expect anyone to take this whole conjection/conjective thing too</i><br>
<i>&gt;seriously, but it illustrates a problem and the beginnings of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;solution. For several reasons, some mentioned above, the term "truth" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not wholly appropriate to our use of it. I believe the term is</i><br>
<i>&gt;inhibitory in one sense due to its bias on a specific modality of</i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness, and inhibitory in another sense due to its static nature,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and its reference to reality without relation to anything else. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Reality changes, there is no absolute reality, so how could there be an</i><br>
<i>&gt;absolute truth. How can we seek absolute truth, something that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;suppose to accord with reality, when reality itself is not absolute and</i><br>
<i>&gt;unchanging. I believe this problem can be solved by more refined, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriate and thus *useful* terminology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our theoris progress, shouldn't our terminology also?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps the term truth is not yet archaic or obsolete, but I imagine it</i><br>
<i>&gt;will one day be so. It merely requires that enough people find it</i><br>
<i>&gt;neccessary for more *useful* terminology. </i><br>
<p>
It just seems to me that the concept of truth is precisely the most<br>
useful concept we have: it tells us what we're aiming *for*, as opposed<br>
to what we've *got*, which is what you're talking about, I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure how exactly this relates, call it an intuitive addition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But I recall someone mentioning once how a surfer can recognize between</i><br>
<i>&gt;twenty or more different kinds of waves, whereas when I look out at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ocean, I just see big or small waves [I live in the midwest so I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;see the ocean or waves often]. I guess I'm proposing in a sense that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;begin to differentiate truth by creating more accurate and less loaded</i><br>
<i>&gt;terms for it. Perhaps that wasn't a good metaphor, but heres another one</i><br>
<i>&gt;along the same lines. In the orient [and elsewhere] many people</i><br>
<i>&gt;generally recognize seven different chakras [some esoteric groups</i><br>
<i>&gt;differentiate between many more]. These chakras are intended to</i><br>
<i>&gt;represent states of consciousnes or modalities of consciousness. Compare</i><br>
<i>&gt;this to the three or so that we tend to focus on, rational [cognitive],</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrational [emotive], and non-rational [intuitive]. I think there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;great deal of room here for some sophistication and greater sensibility.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hitherto I have only been pushing for more balance between the three we</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognize, enhancing the emotive and intuitive, but then there are still</i><br>
<i>&gt;other modalities yet. They could all "prove" to be useful in some</i><br>
<i>&gt;fashion where science is concerned.   </i><br>
<p>
If there's only three chakras, then there's only three, if there's more<br>
there's more: what's the difficulty?  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If we do not have language for something, we might not even recognize</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. There is a great deal of literature on how our language shapes our</i><br>
<i>&gt;perception of reality. I do not believe arguments of semantics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;semiotics are wasted time. Isn't this one of the key elements of</i><br>
<i>&gt;memetics? </i><br>
<p>
What you are talking about, with your waves example (and such things as<br>
the the traditional<br>
Eskimo's snow example, which was recently and amusingly discussed here)<br>
is, I believe, this: there are many different ways of being interested<br>
in things, and these different ways of being interested in things will<br>
prompt us to ask different questions, with different levels of focus on<br>
reality.  But if I, with my meager knowledge of waves ask "is that an x<br>
wave or a y wave?" that question can be answered truly or falsely; and<br>
if a wave-expert asks "is that an x1, y, alpha, gamma or epsilon wave?"<br>
that question can be answered truly or falsely.<br>
