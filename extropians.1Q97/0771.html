Plus it keeps them from splitting open your head with a rock.<br>
<p>
&lt;big primate grin&gt;<br>
<p>
For me, the issue about politeness concerns the in-group/out-group <br>
dynamics and dominance hierarchies in societies and their associated <br>
components (human genome, memes). What is the intention of the <br>
communication? Is "the meaning of the communication the response that <br>
you get?" If not, _why_?<br>
<p>
Before I get into arguments, I try to check _what my purpose_ is:<br>
<p>
Is it to convert others? To reassure others? Or just to win arguments for the <br>
endocrine-thalamic-cortical payoff and _self_-reassurance? (see also <br>
Terror Management Theory...)<br>
<p>
(po1) An exclusive emphasis on self-determination ("autonomy") can make <br>
other primates uneasy. This may be related to the positied CG trait <br>
mentioned earlier.<br>
<p>
(po2) "Jackdaw epistemology" applies to primates. "What I know is <br>
what every jackdaw knows". The simples metamodel: homogeneity. Aka <br>
"it goes without saying."<br>
<p>
(po3) If there are enough points of noncongruence, you're not <br>
every other jackdaw--ergo you are a risk.<br>
<p>
(po4) If you don't reassure them, sometimes primates reach for a rock.<br>
<p>
(po5) a gedanken:<br>
"I don't have to be polite if I'm right" -- hmm. This phrase seems to <br>
mean different things when uttered by:<br>
      a despot, <br>
      a political commentator, <br>
      an investigative reporter, <br>
      a spouse arguing with "the other half", <br>
      a diplomat seeking an alternative to war,<br>
      a teenager,<br>
      the teenager's parent(s).<br>
<p>
(po6) "what do you need a &lt;personal fortune of six figures/cryo contract/<br>
gun/personal spaceship/brain the size of jupiter/...&gt; for?" IS an <br>
impertinent question in a society of perfect individualists--BUT it's the <br>
kind of question one family member asks another, often as polite <br>
pressure to conform as well as justify; it's also a probing question with <br>
the subtext "'are this person's values congruent enough to mine for me to <br>
consider us to still be in the same tribe?"<br>
<p>
I don't like it, but this seems to be some of what I'm thinking these <br>
days...<br>
