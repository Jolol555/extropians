Velociman,<br>
<p>
Cheer up mate!  The thing is, people have these attitudes because<br>
the mind is geared to noticing *problems* - like, good news is no news,<br>
right?  The media generally are geared up to tell us mainly about<br>
problems, and that's a good thing; but it gives intellectuals a somewhat<br>
one sided picture of things.<br>
<p>
Fortunately people's feet and purses don't read newspapers!<br>
<p>
Unfortunately the only cure for myopic intellectuals is to patiently<br>
point out to them that though there are problems with everything, what<br>
you've got to focus on is the ratio of problems solved to problems<br>
created or remaining unsolved with a given set of social institutions,<br>
discoveries, etc. If you focus on that, they suddenly become aware that<br>
most of what happens in the world is better than it is worse, and<br>
doesn't get reported much. They soon (grudgingly) get it.<br>
