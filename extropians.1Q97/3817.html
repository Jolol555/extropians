<p>
Non-problem.  Generally a de-animated person is considered dead, so<br>
pay the claim.  In fact, I think some insurance companies cooperate<br>
with the cryonics agencies, and allow the suspendee to pay for the<br>
suspension with his insurance benefit.  Not too different from using<br>
life insurance death benefits to pay for hospice care, or drug<br>
treatment for AIDS patients.<br>
<p>

<p>
You want someone to pay you after he's been re-animated?<br>
"Welcome back to the land of the living, Mr. Burch.  I'm Herb, your<br>
guide; I'll be working with you to get you used to the changes since<br>
your de-animation.  First, there's some paperwork: you owe your<br>
insurance company $13,000,000..."<br>
<p>
No thanks.<br>
<p>
I'd take the opposite tack.  Sell a re-animation policy.  Like an<br>
annuity.  If the guy re-animates, you're out a lot of money, but what<br>
the hey, you've been earning interest on it for decades...that's what<br>
insurance is about.<br>
