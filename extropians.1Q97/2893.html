Three comments, in brief, appropos this old problem:<br>
<p>
1) Excludability does not represent an essential quality; rather, it bears an<br>
inverse relationship to cost.  In other words,  public goods change in the<br>
face of changing technologies, with historical trends toward the<br>
internalization of positive externalities. See, eg, broadcast-to-cable<br>
transmissions.  I'm unwilling to claim that noone can whup the "national"<br>
defense problem.<br>
<p>
2) Among the probable social technologies for internalizing the benefits of<br>
"national" defense in a polycentric legal order, I would count social<br>
sanctions, with voluntary donations to defense efficiently tracked and tied<br>
to a variety of services.  See, eg, the United Way's devices.  Another<br>
appealling device, especially to large legal systems paying for defense:<br>
 Peace.  (Permit me, if you will, a "duh.")<br>
<p>
3) Robin rightly doubts predictions about the end-state of the end of States.<br>
 Better to advocate jurisdiction based on express consent and let<br>
entrepreneurs take a crack at such problems as national defense and<br>
cross-jurisdictional conflicts.  See, Why Respect the Law? The Polycentric<br>
Justification of Jurisdiction&lt;/EM&gt;, in EXTRO 1: Proceedings of the First<br>
Extropy Institute Conference on Transhumanist Thought, at 46 (1994).<br>
