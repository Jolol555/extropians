  Thanks for question/observation (?).  No, I would not say that I am<br>
  "officially" anything!:) <br>
  I certainly would not want a lot of wonderful and skeptical people who do<br>
 not<br>
  happen to share my views on cryonic suspension or religion to think they<br>
are<br>
  "Outside" of extropian ideas.  Or will be kicked out of the party! :)&gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
 Great response!  ; )<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <br>
 &lt;&lt;I like the orientation that Extropy has in a number of areas.  Including<br>
 the<br>
  pretty clear cut fact, IMHO, that most progress we as a race have made has<br>
  been a result of increasing technology.  Not new versions of old<br>
  superstitions called religions.&gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
  <br>
  Which does not mean there are not some wonderful, kind, thoughtful people<br>
  deeply involved in all sorts of religions.  I just happen to believe that<br>
  they would be "good" people anyway.  They are basically decent, in other<br>
  words, *despite* their particular brand of superstition, not *because* of<br>
 it.<br>

Dear RavnStCrow (Nadia)  <br>
<p>
Hello!  From Rudi Hoffman (RUDIHOFFMA@aol.com)<br>
<p>
You write,<br>
<p>
&lt; I agree, but the sad fact is, most people think that we are sort of<br>
incapable<br>
 of rational actions, never mind being good... I have watched grown men sit<br>
 and say that the only reason we don't commit mayhem on a regular basis is<br>
 because we have something to fear ( God's wrath ) and/or that we have been<br>
 ordered from on high, by a devine source...&gt;<br>
<p>
Part of the whole libertarian/ athiest/ extropian orientation, and a rather<br>
foundational part, IMHO, is the concept that people *are* basically "good".<br>
 Of course, there is quotes around "good" to acknowledge that this is a<br>
rather ill-defined overused "line-drawing" word, but I think most of us have<br>
a reasonable idea of what is meant by "good" here. <br>
<p>
It is interesting to me that the authoritarian approach to life, which I<br>
would define as the opposite of libertarian/ athiest/ extropian assumes<br>
people are basically "evil".  <br>
<p>
Or at least, if we are left to our own devices, that our basic "evil nature"<br>
will out.  The authoritarians therefore decide their infinite wisdom to<br>
proclaim from "on high" what we may or may not do, think, or say.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps there is a time for such a "revealed truth" type of orientation, when<br>
we are not dealing with educated and knowledgeble adults.  <br>
<p>
But for the FDA to tell me as a knowledgeable adult that I may not use a drug<br>
or procedure that may save or improve my life, for example, is RIDICULOUS!  <br>
<p>
Do you remember a few years back our "friends and protectors" at the FDA were<br>
trying to pass regulations that would require prescriptions for megadose<br>
vitamins and herbs?<br>
<p>
Outrageous!  Fortunately, this was such clear cut violation of good sense and<br>
good science that it did not happen, but equivalently "off the wall"<br>
interventionists tactics are threatened by "do-gooders" continually.<br>
<p>
"Thank God for athiests and freethinkers!" :)<br>
 <br>
 &lt;Anyway, thanks for responding in an intelligent way to my joking about<br>
 definitions, there has been some attempts lately to "redefine" extropy... in<br>
 sometimes  bizarre ways...&gt;<br>
<p>
There is a listing somewhere written by Max More (I think) of some extropian<br>
principals.  It is outstanding!  If anyone reading knows where this may be<br>
posted on some board or other, please let me/ us know. <br>
 <br>
&lt; Not that your statement was bizarre in any way-  your 4 things, atheist,<br>
  skeptic, cryonics ( life extension) and Libertarianism, are pretty much<br>
 Extropic staples, I guess...&gt; <br>
  <br>
 Nadia<br>
 &lt;"On with the Automorph"&gt;<br>
<p>
I am intrigued with this. What does it mean?<br>
<p>
Warmly,<br>
<p>
Rudi<br>
 <br>
