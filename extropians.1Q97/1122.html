<i>&gt;                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I did read Calvin's "The Throwing Madonna" a few years ago, I have not read </i><br>
<i>&gt; his "The Cerebral Code", except for a few pages I thumbed through in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; bookstore. The trouble I have with his idea is that throwing an object with </i><br>
<i>&gt; power and accuracy is the most complex, difficult, motion you can put your </i><br>
<i>&gt; arm through, </i><br>
<p>
It may not be, but it is likely to be the motion most connected to your <br>
genetic survival.  And, as Calvin points out, it takes a hell of a lot of <br>
neurons to get the release timing down to the point you can hit targets.<br>
The basic problem is that the timing jitter of nerve cells is way to <br>
high, so high that when Calvin first started thinking about the problem, <br>
he could not figure out how we could hit *anything*.<br>
<p>
             it's hard to believe that it's also the first motion an arm <br>
was <br>
<i>&gt; used for when it was no longer needed for locomotion, even modern humans are </i><br>
<i>&gt; not very good at it. Baseball pitchers get paid millions of dollars because </i><br>
<i>&gt; they have more natural ability at throwing things than 99.9% of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; population, and they still miss the strike zone about as often as they hit it, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and that's a lot bigger than most animals you would hunt, and it's not moving, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and you're using aerodynamic baseballs not irregular rocks, and your brain is </i><br>
<i>&gt; almost 5 times as big as Lucy's. Also, throwing hard creates a huge amount of </i><br>
<i>&gt; ware and tare on the arm, after a few years of doing it for a living the arm </i><br>
<i>&gt; is not of much use for anything, ask any old retired baseball pitcher, an old </i><br>
<i>&gt; man of about 35.</i><br>
<p>
I will certainly argue that a lot of animals humans hunted were much <br>
larger than the strike zone!  They also hunted in groups, where any one <br>
of them getting in a good one was enough.  And while living to 35 was <br>
likely plenty to pass on genes, I very much doubt a hunting group got <br>
that many opportunities to hit something in a day, certainly not as many <br>
throws as a baseball pitcher will make.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;it seems that pre humans got along just fine as projectile                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;hunters using hand axes thrown discus style into groups of                </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;animals at water holes/streams for millions of years.    </i><br>
<i>                  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This might be true but could have nothing to do with the development of &gt;</i><br>
bipedalism. Lucy was as bipedal as you or me but it would be a million years<br>
<i>&gt; later before anybody on earth had a hand ax or a tool.</i><br>
<p>
So much context has been lost that I am not sure how this ran, but I think my<br>
point was that bipetalism was a prerequisite for throwing.  My point was <br>
how the big expansion grew out of the earlier adaptionsaddaptions to projectile <br>
hunting which a chimp sized brain could support.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;In such an environment, really good projectile throwing made                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;the difference between a line which left a lot of descendants                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;and one which left none.  Calvin argues (very well I think)                </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;that this is what drove the expansion of the human brain</i><br>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that if Evolution was only interested in solving one </i><br>
<i>&gt; particular problem, rather than problems in general, it would have developed </i><br>
<i>&gt; an elaborate throwing reflex, not intelligence. Then again, Evolution never </i><br>
<i>&gt; does things the easy sensible way, so maybe.</i><br>
<p>
Calvin argues that the expansion of the brain for throwing hauled along <br>
many, many other things.  The same motion sequencer that is used to throw <br>
rocks he proposes gets used when not throwing for such things as <br>
generating sentences.<br>
