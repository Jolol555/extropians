<i>&gt; From: Guru George </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Speaking as a techno musician, of both house and drum&amp;bass genres, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have to say that you are quite right about techno not being experimental</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in a sense.  Modern techno music is a quite narrowly constrained genre.</i><br>
<i>&gt; All the sounds, fx, etc., are designed with people in mind who are out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their trees on drugs.  There is a selection pressure that comes from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dance floor, via the DJ, to the music-makers, that drives us to copy what</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people are doing that works on the dance floor</i><br>
<p>
The techno scene died because of the popularity of the DJ's in the mid<br>
eighties. Ever since then it has been mostly dance thats been focused on.<br>
DJ's world view is so narrow minded. Techno could be so much more, and of<br>
course it will be again, but the last ten years has mostly been a musical<br>
dead zone. (with some exeptions.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The whole thing is a beautiful example of 1) the free market at work,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and 2) the aesthetic notion that great art comes from tightly</i><br>
circumscribed<br>
<i>&gt; art forms, not rule-less free-form 'self-expression'.</i><br>
<p>
I find that it's a perfect example of what happens when technology makes it<br>
too easy for thousand of people with no imagination or nothing to say to<br>
make something that "sounds right" or seems like art.<br>
