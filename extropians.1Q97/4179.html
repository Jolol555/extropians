<i>&gt;It seems to me that people most adept at computers have generally only the</i><br>
<i>&gt;most superficial awareness of their (and others') emotions.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is less true than most people think,<br>
but more true than some of us would like to believe.<br>
<p>
To the extent it's true, it's closely related to the *myth* of<br>
computers, our culture's ideas and images of what computers are about.<br>
Ted Nelson has written about it, and reading his _Computer Lib_ was<br>
what switched me from being a computer insider wannabe to a computer<br>
outsider-insider wannabe.  That is, someone who loves computers and wants<br>
to know all the coolest things going on in the field while not buying into<br>
the industry's notions of what's going on.<br>
<p>
The Myth, though, provides excuses for crappy, nasty hardware and software<br>
(the Technical Reason Too Difficult To Explain).<br>
It provides rationales for people in charge of computers to have various<br>
sorts of power over people who just use them.<br>
It provides ways for people who aren't computer people to look down<br>
on computers and those nerdy computer people.<br>
It gives the "it's too hard" excuse for non-comps not to learn.<br>
It gives a reason non-experts have to ask experts for help.<br>
It gives a reason for experts to look down on users ("Lusers").<br>
It gives people a way to feel like they know something important when they<br>
learn some detail or collection of details.<br>
<p>
In other words, it's an existing stereotype (or complimentary pair of<br>
stereo(hah)types), that encourages people to sort themselves into two<br>
categories, and then gives them incentives to maintain and exaggerate<br>
the stereotype, not just in what they believe but by taking the roles and<br>
acting out the stereotypes.  (Sometimes you play the expert in one context<br>
and the user in another.)<br>
<p>
Nelson pointed out that the stereotype isn't really justified by the nature<br>
of computers themselves (which are just boxes programmable to act however<br>
we want).  Instead it seems to be a way for our culture to play out various<br>
inner conflicts and themes, like a Rorschach (sp?) inkblot.  One conflict<br>
he mentioned was a scale:<br>
     Computer (too cold)<br>
                &lt;----&gt; Warm Human Being (just right)<br>
                         &lt;---&gt; Bum, Nigger, Hippie, Psycho (too emotional)<br>
The thing here is that in order to be at just the right point on the scale,<br>
you need to have examples to the left and right of you to be "too far" in<br>
either direction.  So "the computer" fills that "cold" role--as do<br>
computer people.  Or maybe the computer people are on a scale of<br>
   too obsessed/focussed/narrow &lt;--&gt; just right &lt;--&gt; airhead/A.D.D.<br>
<p>
It's not reality, and it's not a Lie propagated by a Conspiracy either.<br>
It's a game with incentives for everybody to take sides in and play, and<br>
most people do.  And as part of playing, you pass on the incentives and<br>
the Myth to others.<br>
<p>
I don't know if my anger shows through here.  The idea that instead of the<br>
truth, people deal in these *consensus travesties* of the truth, and<br>
willingly descend into these childish role-playing games, leading "us<br>
innocents" into the same roles--it gripes my butt.  Probably because I<br>
was already sucked in.  I think I'm one of those people who would've gone<br>
much further in the Nerd direction without _Computer Lib_ appearing at the<br>
right time.<br>
