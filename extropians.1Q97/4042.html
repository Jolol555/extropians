<i>&gt;Both are now faced with major problems.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Which one of us is married?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who goes to work on Monday,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In my case the original probably does.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course neither are the same person that existed in that past,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but if I were the copy I would let the copied assume responsiblity </i><br>
<i>&gt;for the past, unless it was not so inclined to do so.</i><br>
<p>
This brings to mind an interesting question.  Is the clone to be held<br>
responsible for crimes (real crimes, like murder) which were committed by the<br>
"original" sometime just prior to duplication?  For example, if I murdered my<br>
wife (I wouldn't &amp; I'm not currently married, but for the sake of an<br>
example...), and then I duplicated myself, and then the law enforcement<br>
officers (whatever kind then exists) arrive to arrest the perpatrator, who do<br>
they arrest?  I ask because if the answer is that only the original is<br>
arrested, then criminal types by the dozens would flock to duplication<br>
chambers everywhere, as to avoid (at least on one line of existence)<br>
prosicution.  On the other hand, if both the "original" and the cloned copy<br>
were to be prosicuted, then they would need to be put on trial together, a<br>
"strange" arrangement.  Any comments or answers?<br>
<p>
On another note, I believe the entire idea of punishment as it is known today<br>
will one day become obsolete.  When you "punish" someone, it does not improve<br>
or change the crime that has been committed.  The real answer, I believe,<br>
lies is changing the fundamental reason the crime was committed (I mean real<br>
crime - force, fraud, coercion), thus preventing future crimes, while<br>
maintaining the person's ability to be a productive individual.  In our<br>
techno-advanced future, these crimes will be eliminated by neural<br>
restructuring or some such thing.  This may bring up the question of prisons<br>
in the future, before everyone has been "uncriminalized", would it be<br>
permissable, or objectively OK, to make neural modifications by force to<br>
criminals?  This would be preferable, I believe, to death or prison.  I hope<br>
this brings many comments.  Thanks for listening.<br>

My favorite quote:"Condemnation without investigation is the height of<br>
ignorance."<br>
Anyone know where that quote came from?  I forgot.  Thanks.<br>
