<p>
You're not going to find authoritative sources on this because it's not much<br>
of a problem.  CR before adulthood will stunt growth, but once brain growth<br>
is done in early childhood it won't cause significant health problems.<br>
 Losing too fast can cause trouble (e.g. anorexics), particularly heart<br>
trouble; in mouse models you need about 6 months to lose the weight safely.<br>
 Whether this translates to humans needing 6 months or 5 years is an open<br>
question.  Few, however, can maintain a level of CR intense enough to lose<br>
that much weight (30-40% below a normal lean weight) in any circumstances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All I can say is that in my own notes on calorie restriction </i><br>
<i>&gt;(<a href="http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/extro/lifex.html#cr">http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/extro/lifex.html#cr</a>) I've recorded</i><br>
<i>&gt;several comments to this effect - most likely picked up from</i><br>
<i>&gt;sci.life-extension. One even went so far as to say, "Don't start</i><br>
<i>&gt;until you're 45."</i><br>
<p>
That one's off the deep end.  The question is more whether it needs to be<br>
started before puberty for maximum effect.  Some research has indicated a<br>
loss of effectiveness with late onset of CR.<br>
