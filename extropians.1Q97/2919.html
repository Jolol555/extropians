<i>&gt; &gt;It's true, the market can not find a solution to a problem if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;nobody wants a solution to that problem, but problems that don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;need fixing are not problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, yes, I would *like* to believe this, but isn't it sometimes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case that there can be a problem that nobody (except a few experts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say) *sees* as a problem (or nobody *wants* to see as a problem -</i><br>
<i>&gt; say the presence of large numbers of automobiles, for instance), so</i><br>
<i>&gt; nobody seeks a solution to the problem, so the market won't find</i><br>
<i>&gt; one?  Isn't this the sort of thing Joost is talking about?</i><br>
<p>
I think that has always been one of the central problems in creating<br>
a functional and just system of government.  Some important problems<br>
will require specialized knowlege just to recognize them.  Free<br>
markets are not effective at solving such problems.  The squeaky<br>
wheel will get the grease, while another silently deteriorates until<br>
it breaks.  Even worse, not everything that is good or desireable for<br>
individuals or small groups will be good for the society as a whole. <br>
In these cases, free markets are worse than ineffective.  Please do<br>
not ASS-U-ME that I am arguing that free markets are a bad thing. <br>
My point is only that they are not a viable solution to every<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
Recognizing this is easy enough.  But dealing with it is not.  I<br>
doubt that it is possible to devise a system that can perform<br>
optimally for every possible circumstance.  I think that the most<br>
reasonable approach is a system that has ample provisions for<br>
correcting itself so that the distinction between that which is<br>
governed by pure market dynamics, and that which is governed by the<br>
collective authority, can be adjusted either when circumstances<br>
change or when previous decisions prove to be either<br>
counterproductive or ineffective.  Most democratic governments<br>
already attempt to acheive this kind of balance.  They have not been<br>
completely successful in reaching this iedal, but they still have<br>
performed better than most other systems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm always torn by this question: do we admit that some people may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be in a position to notice things most of us can't or won't, and do</i><br>
<i>&gt; we grant them power to effect changes that would be beneficial to</i><br>
<i>&gt; us all?</i><br>
<p>
The first part is easy.  It would be foolish not to admit that such<br>
is the case.  But even with that, the second question remains a<br>
difficult one.  Largely for the reason you mention below.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Take a look at Mancur Olson's work, for instance, where</i><br>
<i>&gt; he shows that  majority interests often gets shafted by better</i><br>
<i>&gt; organised minority interests) Then you get into "Who watches the</i><br>
<i>&gt; watchmen?" stuff - a *very* old and knotty problem.</i><br>
                                        Peace,<br>
                                        William Kitchen<br>
