I don't want to seem like I'm defending de Garis's views, but he doesn't<br>
disagree with anything you have said. He says that if women have been<br>
underrepresented historically because the Man has been keeping them down, <br>
then we should have seen an increase in the proportion of female geniuses<br>
in last 30 years. But he claims they still represent around 5%.<br>
