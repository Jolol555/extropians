Ah, yes. Another answer to Robin's question is that our society is<br>
permeated with the Dogma of Democracy, and the Dogma of Democracy<br>
is that any randomly chosen citizen's opinion about a political<br>
issue is exactly as valuable and likely to be "true" as anyone<br>
else's opinion of that issue. Therefore, each of us can expound<br>
and hold forth on our political opinions without any shred of<br>
epistemic responsibility, and since this is the attitude that<br>
everyone else takes, thanks to their democratic religious beliefs,<br>
I end up mirroring this attitude toward my opponents in debate.<br>
<p>
So ultimately, as with so many other stupidities, it comes down to<br>
a question of religious belief.<br>
