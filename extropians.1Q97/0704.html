<i>&gt;area, and I can transfer the old knowledge to the new area.  By the way, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;internal language I develop when I learn new things is very different (at</i><br>
<i>&gt;least superficially) to spoken language; there are no sounds to represent the</i><br>
<i>&gt;symbols, so they are not anything I can communicate easily to other people,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I know what I mean when I think them.</i><br>

That is very flexible of you. I have noticed a great deal of difficulty in<br>
coceptualizing without depending on language, at least for a double-check,<br>

<i>&gt;It seems to me that every cognitive ability can be improved significantly with</i><br>
<i>&gt;practice.  The level of difficulty seems to depend on how familiar one is with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ability and with how strongly one is motivated to improve it.  Also, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;depends on how appropriately one goes about improving the particular ability;</i><br>
<i>&gt;each one requires a different approach to improve.</i><br>

definitely. and now non-linguistic reasoning seems to be back on the long<br>
list of possibilities.<br>
