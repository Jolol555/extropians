<i>&gt; Sarah Marr:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Art is a discourse, and the creators of Extropic Art act as a voice for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropianism; indeed, they may define Extropianism.</i><br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Kathryn Aegis:</i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree.  I have never heard of a philosophy, a movement, or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; religion that has been defined by its artists or by their artwork.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
As an expressive vehicle the artist acts as the barometer of an era. The<br>
artist defines the personality and psychological condition of that which<br>
the artist represents. The artist is the emotive aspect underlying and<br>
outwardly representing any society or institituition. The artist<br>
amplifies and accentuates the qualities of an organization while<br>
revealing that organization's affectual ramifications. The statement of<br>
an artist is first and formost a statement of condition, a state of<br>
mind, a status of society. It is the testemonial of an organization's<br>
member. <br>
<p>
<p>
Encountering an alien organization, we would first attempt to gage their<br>
technology, the potential threat of the encounter. But its through their<br>
collective art that we will be able to percieve their intentions. Its<br>
through their art that we will be able to see what kind of people they<br>
are. Art is the professor of truth in that it cannot be shackled. It is<br>
what it is. It reveals the fixations, pleasures, motivations, and<br>
general concerns of that which it represents. The aesthetic runs through<br>
and directs the technology. Technology exists for the sake of art ...<br>
that which pleases us. We create the technology because our<br>
pscychological [creative] condition necessitates it, and then the art<br>
reveals the condition itself.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thus [objectively] the importance of the artist is the artist's <br>
revalatory capacity. The importance of a society's art is that arts<br>
revealing of its society.<br>
<p>
<p>
We create a system, and as members of that system we generate art, and<br>
if that art shows problematic signs of neurosis, then we can and should<br>
rethink the system. This is how the artist truely questions and further<br>
aids to define that which is represented. <br>
<p>
<p>
Art is the ergonomics of technology. It is how the technology "fits" the<br>
people. It is an ecquisitely insightful reflection of the people.  <br>
<p>
Subjectively: Art is the manifestation of our pleasures.<br>
Objectively: Art is the status of our condition.<br>
<p>
Art can only aid in the self-definition of an organization to the degree<br>
in which that organization is sufficiently aware of art's reflexive<br>
capacity. To the degree that an organization uses art reflectively, to<br>
that degree will art define the organization.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thus, what role should art play in Extropian thought?<br>
<p>
Subjectively: It should take full advantage of cutting edge technologies<br>
to manifest our refined pleasures, which includes the expression and<br>
transmittance of Extropic memes, a certain pleasure, while seeding<br>
interest in the development of new technologies which will further<br>
enable the manifestation of our progressively evolving pleasures.   <br>
<p>
Objectively: It should be persistently analysed in order to access and<br>
refine the psychological condition and ramifications of the<br>
organization. [This is the responsibility factor; self-evaluation.]<br>
<p>
The latter [objective] use of art should be expected from any<br>
individual, organization, nation, or society. Its merely a refined sense<br>
of self-awareness.<br>
<p>
One last quick statement on censorship. Censorship is a denial of<br>
problematic symptoms. Censorship itself is a symptom of an organization<br>
or society which is unwilling to take responsibility for that which it<br>
manifests. Censorship may put a bandage over art, but the "pimples" will<br>
continue to emerge and inflame until the organization accepts its<br>
responsibility in initiating that which is the cause of the art, and<br>
thus when that organization seeks something greater than a topical<br>
solution. The alternative to censorship is acceptance of responsibility,<br>
and re-assessment of idealogy.<br>
<p>
Art which tests the limits of our experience, tests and redefines the<br>
limits of our existence.<br>
<p>
<p>
Explore and play!<br>
