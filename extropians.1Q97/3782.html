<p>
I disagree. The anthropologist would be mistaken, *unless* she noted that<br>
she was including non-extropian writings of well known extropians to<br>
satisfy the curiosity of readers. If an Extropian writes something clearly<br>
not extropian, then it doesn't become extropian simply because they wrote it. <br>
<p>
As I noted, there are fuzzy areas where something is compatible with<br>
extropian attitudes but not particularly expressive of them. I think the<br>
only sensible argument would be whether "Extropian writing" refers to<br>
writing with an obviously extropian content, or should include writings by<br>
an Extropian that does not obviously embody extropian ideas (so long as it<br>
does not embody unextropian ideas like glorification of death). The same<br>
points apply, mutatis mutandis to Extropic Art.<br>
<p>
Put it this way: Let's say Painter A typically paints in a Cubist style.<br>
You're producing two art history books, one on Cubism and one on Abstract<br>
Expressionism. (If these are not the best examples of a sharply differing<br>
contrast please substitute appropriately.) Painter A did one or two<br>
paintings in Abstract Expressionist mode. Would you include those in the<br>
Cubism book? Or in the Abstract Expressionist book? Clearly they belong in<br>
the latter book. The fact that Painter A has usually been a Cubist does not<br>
make a piece of Abstract Expressionism into a Cubist work.<br>
<p>
What I'm saying is that a source-based definition is not a basic<br>
definition. It's only an approximation. Someone who could reasonably be<br>
called a Cubist generally produces Cubist Art. So we can usually say the<br>
works of this Cubist are Cubist. But this won't always be true. It's the<br>
content (or, rather, the style in this case) that makes them Cubist. It's<br>
the content that makes Extropic Art extropic, not the source.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oh, I agree absolutely.  The point of my comments has been to offer an</i><br>
<i>&gt;alternative  approach to the problem of defining Extropic art.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt;source-based definition can give fairly clear boundaries, I think, and avoids</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystification.  Nonetheless, I for now remain agnostic about whether one</i><br>
<i>&gt;ought to embrace a content-, intent-, or source-based definition.  It</i><br>
suffices<br>
<i>&gt;, for present purposes, to understand that "define it by content or not at</i><br>
<i>&gt;all!" constitutes a false dichotomy.</i><br>
<p>
No it's not a false dichotomy. The source-based definition is parasitic on<br>
the content-based definition. To deny this is to cut loose any<br>
comprehensible understanding of a genre. Work by an Extropic Artist can<br>
generally be assumed to be extropic because the source is extropian. But<br>
sometimes it may not be. The way to decide that is to check the contents.<br>
The answer to "Is this piece of work extropic?" may not always have a clear<br>
answer but trying to answer it is the only way to determine the<br>
extropicness of the art. Extropic ideas are consistent, people are not always.<br>
<p>
The definition and explanation of Extropic Art in Natasha's Extropic Art<br>
Manifesto seems to me to do a fine job of defining  the genre in terms of<br>
its content. The great value of the Manifesto is in its potential to spread<br>
our ideas through new avenues, and to affect people on levels other than<br>
the analytical.<br>
