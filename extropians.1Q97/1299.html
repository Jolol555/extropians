<i>&gt;        No doubt!  Sometimes we get so busy trying to *build* bridges to the future that we don't see that there may be some that are already there.

Greetings Shaun, Nadia!<br>
<p>
<p>
Well I don't know if I know of an existing bridge, If I have found one and recognize it as a bridge I'll let you know...:).  I'm not so arrogant to believe that my beliefs are for everyone, in fact I'm sure they aren't, and that is ok with me.  I prefer diversity of everything, it is that fertile ground which creates the possibilities of evolvement.  And life would be pretty dull, if not dead, without diversity!  And since I believe in self-actualization, without diverse beliefs I wouldn't learn very much, would I?  My personal path is one that I am happy with now, a huge mish mash of stuff, which will change as I go along, because there is always more to learn and collect.  (I feel like a packrat when it comes to ideas).  I thirst for knowledge, novelty, ecstatic experience.  <br>

Thank you Shaun.  I was a bit surprised at Michael's "welcome".  I offered the URLs merely to elucidate a bit where I was coming from rather than exhaust the bandwidth with a description on email, in case anyone was interested.  If they aren't interested they don't have to look at them.  "If you don't like it you can't have any!" as a number of folks in my community say.<br>
<p>
<p>
And considering I am trying to secure a living from the net, I don't see how letting people know what I do in a place of free exchange such as this would be objectionable.  After all, everyone else here lists their websites!  I've been to Natasha's and a few others, interesting folks here.  Natasha your extropian art is wonderful!  I wish I had some extra cash to buy one of your paintings.  Maybe in the future.<br>
<p>
<p>
In the spirit of free exchange....<br>
