That's why I carefully avoided saying you could "become" the animal. The<br>
mapping of sensations isn't going to be perfect. If nothing else, animals<br>
have senses we don't (example: the electrical microcurrent sensors of sharks<br>
and other sea creatures, or the IR sensing pits of some snakes.). The <br>
transfer will certainly not be perfect, but since we currently have very<br>
little insight into the minds of other species, that which we can transfer<br>
will be quite an improvement of understanding. Some of the emotional content<br>
will probably map pretty directly, and some of it won't. Part of science<br>
is understanding the areas in which a given method of inquiry gives a close<br>
analogy of what is actually being observed, and what areas it gives poor<br>
analogies.<br>
Will it give you everything? No, but it will certainly give you a much better<br>
understanding within the limits of what you are able to map onto your own<br>
ability to sense and experience.<br>
Note, this is a seperate idea from morphing oneself into some amalgam of <br>
animal/human. That's a cosmetic, and social motivation, not one for gaining<br>
new knowledge.<br>
