 <br>
Wrath?  What wrath?  After medieval times many thinkers started viewing<br>
natural philosophy as due homage to God, by studying His greatest work,<br>
Creation.  I think Francis Bacon had this view; Thomas Paine (after<br>
Newton, of couse) did; Franklin might have.  I cannot evaluate the<br>
argument myself, but there are those who credit Christianity with<br>
fostering science, by establishing (according to some scholastics) that<br>
God was not whimsical and the universe would thus operate according to<br>
rules (which He could still violate at option, thus miracles, but the<br>
rest of the time there would be rules).  This leads to the idea that it<br>
is worthwhile to look for the rules of nature -- now that you assume<br>
there are some -- and gives motivation for doing so, as a form of<br>
natural worship, for what artist does not appreciate an audience?<br>
<p>
I'm not saying X-nity hasn't hampered science; obviously it has.  But it<br>
may also have caused it.  Would pagan Germanic tribes have discovered<br>
science?  The vaunted Icelanders have had widespread literacy for longer<br>
than any other European culture, possibly any other culture period.<br>
They're Christian, but never very fanatically, and their views of sex<br>
and women remained Teutonic, hence much healthier.  They're also quite<br>
superstitious and believing of psychic phenomena.  (All data from<br>
Richard Tommasson's _Iceland_.)<br>
<p>
Hunh.  Actually that's something I've noted in SF: superstitious<br>
anarchists rival 'scientific' ones in representation.  Vinge's Mikin are<br>
superstitious as hell; Cherryh's atevi (_Foreigner_ series, ruled by<br>
non-geographical warlords or PPLs, depending on your POV) answer to<br>
numerology.<br>

Holy Wood!...was that special sort of beautiful area which is only<br>
beautiful if you can leave after briefly admiring its beauty and go<br>
somewhere else where there are hot tubs and cold drinks.  Actually<br>
staying there for any length of time is a penance. -- _Moving Pictures_<br>
