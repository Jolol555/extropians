<i>&gt; All of these molecules are composed of atoms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At the atomic level, from which we must assume life arose in the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; place, what are (were) the forces operating to generate complexity and</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is (was)</i><br>
<i>&gt; the form of selection operating on the atoms? How can it be "survival of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fittest" when we consider that, compared to living beings, atoms are</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtually immortal? A block of metal is not alive but under most</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances it can far outlive any creature.</i><br>
<p>
We don't look at atoms; we look at systems of atoms.  It's the systems<br>
of atoms, the configurations, that evolve and become more complex.  If<br>
atoms could evolve, they would.  But they can't, so they don't.  Instead<br>
the majority of systems we perceive are there because their ancestors<br>
survived and reproduced.  The code-codons, the instructions making up<br>
the Ancestor program, were fundamentally immortal as well - they were<br>
baked into the simulation.  The Ancestor still evolved, even though the<br>
instructions didn't.  And thus life evolves, even though the atoms of<br>
which it is made up are immortal.<br>
<p>
Look around you; do you see a lot of plutonium?  No, because plutonium<br>
isn't stable; it decays.  In point of fact, everything decays into iron<br>
eventually; in some ridiculous number of years, all stars decay to Cold<br>
Iron, master of them all - and thence, in 10^(10^76) years, I think, to<br>
black holes.  Selection doesn't operate on the atomic scale in such a<br>
fashion as to produce greater complexity.  At best, the Ancestor might<br>
have evolved to contain more "multiply" instructions than "add"<br>
instructions, or some such, but the instructions themselves could not<br>
become more complex.  They were not the units of selection.  The<br>
arrangement of atoms, in Ancestor and here, are the units of selection. <br>
It is the arrangements that become more complex.<br>
<p>
"Evolution" is an abstraction from an informational system.  It does not<br>
need to be present in the causal primitives in order to be present in<br>
the system.<br>
