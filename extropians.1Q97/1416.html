<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is a common belief that there is something or someone *having*</i><br>
experiences.   This belief is what gives rise to the ideas of "souls".  Our<br>
culture teaches  us to believe that we are separate from our experiences,<br>
that we are  individuals *having* experiences.  This is the main duality<br>
our culture  embraces, the split between mind and body, between the<br>
experiencer and the  experiences.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I really don't necessarily believe that we are separate from our<br>
experiences, nor do I believe the "what" that is experiencing is<br>
separate....it is the experiencer and the experiencee....  Actually I don't<br>
have "beliefs" per se....only intuitions of what I feel is real through my<br>
subjective experience.  However this "what" may be an integral part of<br>
whatever else we are, but this doesn't mean that it ends when this temporal<br>
body ceases to exist viably.  I don't really agree that feeling there is a<br>
"something" which is experiencing is duality either.  The energy that is in<br>
my body, just as all energy, doesn't dicontinue existence because my body<br>
ceases to function....unless somehow this basic law of physics doesn't<br>
apply to hman beings.  And I do not see why some aspects of this "energy"<br>
may not encompass parts of my consciousness as well.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I consider this duality, I see how deeply ingrained it is in our way</i><br>
of  looking at the world and in our habits of speech.  I also see how<br>
blatently  flawed the duality is.  To me, it seems obvious that there is no<br>
such duality,  but I do not know how to explain it convincingly.&lt;<br>
<p>
I don't really understand why you regard this as a duality.  A Duality<br>
would mean that there is a separation inherent constantly.....I regard this<br>
energy, this "what" (or if you wish soul) as what infuses this corporeal<br>
body with life.  It is hardly separate.  If it were you wouldn't I feel be<br>
alive.  Something happens when you die, though...something "vital" has left.  <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is no one experiencing anything; there are only experiences</i><br>
themselves.   Consciousness is an *experience*; our experience of selfhood<br>
is an *experience*.  We *are* our experiences; we are not something<br>
*separate* from  them.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you want to know what you are?  Behold yourself!  That's what you are.</i><br>
You are this.  This Very Experience.  You are right here, in all the<br>
details of this very moment.  Every feeling, every sensation, every<br>
thought, every memory or impression; that is *you*!  The *awareness* of the<br>
world, of other people, of plants and animals and everything; that<br>
*awareness* is you.  Everything you encounter is within you, for you to<br>
even be aware of it.  The moving colors and sounds may come from an outside<br>
source (an objective world), but the <br>
sensations themselves become an intergral part of you as soon as you are<br>
aware of them.  You *are* that awareness; you *are* that sensation.  If<br>
it's experienced, then it is already part of you; for you *are* that<br>
experience.&gt;<br>
<p>
I understand what you are saying here, and agree with some aspects, though<br>
not all.  Though I have to remark that it seems to come dangerously close<br>
to solipsism, (and please correct me if I've misunderstood you).  The<br>
danger here I could see if we follow that to it's extreme is that "if it's<br>
experienced, then it is already part of you" is the concept that the victim<br>
of a crime such as rape or whatever has that is already part of them.  This<br>
then can lead to essentially blaming the victim..."somewhere inside you you<br>
wanted to be raped, or you needed that lesson".  Interestingly enough a lot<br>
of New Age thought, which definitely believes in a concept of soul, falls<br>
into this trap as well.  I don't necessarily think whatever it is that is<br>
experiencing here is here for lessons or anything else except to experience<br>
incarnate existence (unlike a lot of New Agers do), maybe it is, or maybe<br>
it's incarnate just because it's fun.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I know, I'm being redundant and repetitive and saying the same thing over</i><br>
and over again; I'm just hoping that if I say it enough, in enough<br>
different ways, it will sink in.  It's such an obvious point, and so simple<br>
to see, once you fully realize it.  It's *amazing* how many people don't<br>
notice the obvious, though.  The *self* is this current moment of<br>
experience, the shifting patterns of thought and sensation, of memory and<br>
emotion.  Some patterns change quickly, and others change slowly, but<br>
nothing is permanent. &lt;<br>
<p>
It's really not a matter of not having realized this at one point or the<br>
other, David, it's just that in my experience I don't see why this<br>
awareness of the moment means that the "what" doesn't continue existence in<br>
another form after leaving the body.  I don't see a disparity or a<br>
dichotomy of  both possibilities existing at the same time.  I know that<br>
the self is the current moment of experience, etc, etc.  And that doesn't<br>
mean I believe that anything is permanent, including the what....for it to<br>
be permanent it couldn't change nor experience...at all.  But just because<br>
i agree that nothing is permanent, doesn't mean that I say then or feel<br>
that when we die, that's it, there's no more.  The experiences I have had<br>
counter that idea to a wild extent.  I feel that this "whatever" because it<br>
is a form of energy can neither be created nor destroyed, merely<br>
transfomed.  If any of you have any knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism, then you<br>
might have an understanding of where I'm coming from.  This "what" that is<br>
experiencing is very similar to me to the flame that is passed from one<br>
candle to the next.  The original flame is never really there, but the<br>
energy of that flame flowed.  Or another anaology would be a stream.  You<br>
can never place your foot in the same stream twice, because the water is<br>
always different, the energy different etc....that doesn't mean that the<br>
energy doesn't continue.  Does anyone understand what i'm saying here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are ephemeral, transient patterns, rising from other patterns and</i><br>
flowing on to become something else.  From moment to moment, experiencing<br>
the reality that we are.  We are this; This Very Moment.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
No disagreement David with that.  In fact from what I wrote above I think<br>
you can see that I'm in complete agreement.  I just don't think there is<br>
permanent ending to that pattern.....nothing is permanent?  Then that<br>
includes endings.  For me, btw, i look at death as an aspect of<br>
transformation, one of the many transformations that the "what" goes<br>
through.  Though I would like to put it off as long as possible to savor<br>
this experience, because frankly I love being corporeal, I do not regard<br>
death as a permanent experience.  Permanence implies, to me, no change,<br>
which is from all indications,  impossible.  I think the only absolute that<br>
I could probably name *is* change.  <br>
