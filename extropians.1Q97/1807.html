<i>&gt; of predatory behavior in general.  It is a very deeply rooted problem</i><br>
that is<br>
<i>&gt; much older and more general than anything specifically to do with</i><br>
capitalism,<br>
<i>&gt; and a problem which we humans are not in any way exempt from.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We may transcend this problem, but we will certainly no longer be human</i><br>
when<br>
<i>&gt; we do so.  Are you ready to be non-human?</i><br>
<p>
Yes I am. However there is the outlook of comprehensive philanthropy that<br>
is needed to link the two species. I arrived at this link in February 1994<br>
when I set about drafting a synoptic anatomy of transhumanity. During this<br>
process I outlined the metaethics of transhumanity and a very interesting<br>
future it predicted, indeed. Later, I redefined all words using a 'human'<br>
component and found that a, spiral rather than circular, logic between the<br>
two sets was connected by the word 'transhumanitarianism' in which<br>
philanthropy was included to give the same meaning as humanitarianism. In<br>
1994 I did not use the modern 'trans' prefix and settled on the Greek root<br>
of 'ek' for brevity. Not that I'm wanting to convince the extropians to<br>
adopt the 'ekhuman' word instead of 'transhuman' but it had a better ring<br>
to it than using the Latin prefix with the obvious derision created by the<br>
word exhuman. <br>
<p>
While we're on the subject of circular logic I would like to point out that<br>
after a juxtaposition is created between two concepts, maps can easily be<br>
made using psychological correlation tables to quickly determine if the<br>
common Fourier space is being used consistently.<br>
<p>
<p>
Best,<br>
