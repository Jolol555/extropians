Hope you don't mind me jumping in here, i've got some alternative ways for<br>
you to look at it.<br>

<p>
I'm sure certain parts will be left out, especially in the early stages of<br>
the technology becoming available. The question for the individual becomes<br>
'when does the attraction of eternal life surpass the negative effects of<br>
having some parts of your personality lost ?' As technology is better able<br>
to save more of this personality, this question will become easier.  <br>
<p>
A few years ago the world changed massively from analogue musical storage<br>
devices to digital. Loss of data (of elements of the music) was prefered<br>
over the noise (and limited DURABILITY !) of the analogue storage devices.<br>
In a way not the music (emotion) is stored, but the data to reproduce that<br>
music (emotion).   <br>
<p>
On the other hand, there may be people who don't value some 'human<br>
qualities' very highly. I'd personally do away with my digestive system<br>
tomorrow if there was a reasonable technological alternative, i'd also have<br>
an emotional blocker installed (with on and off switch), a brain interface<br>
with memory storage capabilities. Optional increased eyesight, and other<br>
general improvements would be interesting. Personally i couldn't care less,<br>
if i ended up looking like something from a bad horror movie (it might<br>
actually be benficial in my profession) But i assume some more 'cosmetically<br>
acceptable' formulas will be found.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;except</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps at the very instance of death to upload, to me seems very, very</i><br>
<i>&gt;strange.  how can it possibly include the complexities of emotions we feel</i><br>
<p>
Escaping finite existence is only one reason for uploading. Some of us are<br>
actually attracted to the rationality of machines, maybe some even envy the<br>
order that is missing in our human lives. Ofcourse i don't think you will<br>
find a posthuman who will gladly give up his emotions. But i think a small<br>
loss of emotional capability can become acceptable when that barrier of<br>
advantages and disadvantages of uploading is crossed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyhow, I like the flesh!  :)  It's warm, and it's me.  I don't think you</i><br>
<i>&gt;can upload *that*.</i><br>
<p>
Most people have some parts of their body removed at some part in their<br>
life. Tonsils, appendix, or worse. Sometimes the reason for removal of that<br>
body part is to save your life / health. In the case of uploading (as it's<br>
suggested now) you can look at it in this way: the whole body has to be<br>
removed in order not to die, just as logical ?. Sometimes there are other<br>
reasons for removing flesh (cosmetic surgery/gender change). After removal<br>
or addition of that flesh/body part you are slightly less 'you' than you<br>
were before. Although some people might feel more complete :-), perfectly<br>
willing to give up some of their flesh/feeling, for an added value. Maybe<br>
this is another way of looking at posthumans as well. Ofcourse the brain is<br>
a wholy different subject.<br>
<p>
<p>
Personally i have metal in my mouth, and i won't hesitate putting the<br>
material elsewhere if it brings me benefits. <br>
