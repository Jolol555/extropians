mikec@jax.gulfnet.com (Mike C.)writes:<br>

<i>&gt; Is memory of the event enough to cause guilt?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It is an implanted memory programmed into it during creation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
 <br>
This raises an interesting point. What is the PURPOSE of establishing guilt?<br>
Interestingly, in Shawn's original post he inquired into the concept of<br>
"punishment" -a hot topic in debate circles. But the list did not pick up<br>
that thread.<br>
Culpablitity means one has been rendered "harmful" and punishment attempts to<br>
repair and pervent further harm. Is it even effective? Can preventative<br>
measures be more effective? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Is capability of murder enough for guilt?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Who is not capable of knifing some one?</i><br>
<p>
This raises another ETHICS question: Do you past experiences make you what<br>
you are? <br>
<p>
(One comes upon this question when confronted with the OJ trials.) <br>
<p>
Most people would fear a known killer, they would judge him capable of<br>
repeating the act - even expect it in some. <br>
<p>
Re: the last question:Many are capable, should we  punish them before they do<br>
it? Many are not, should we punish them anyway ( in a sense we are, because<br>
we all pay heavily for jails, lawyers and police systems)? Are you suggesting<br>
original sin?<br>
; - )<br>

( And again, since cloning , not replication, is the technology at hand, and<br>
genomes don't come equipped with implanted memories, this 'identical copy'<br>
thread - re; cloning anyway, is  a fun but 'mental' masterbation??  ; )<br>
