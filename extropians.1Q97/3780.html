<i>&gt; &gt;    I'll give you a different problem to worry about...  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people of all ages today who are falling off the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bandwagon.  Those who manage to stay on the tiger (Mixed metaphores?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why not?), are getting further and further ahead of those not on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; board.  Will there be a point at which no one not already on the train</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can get on?  Sure looks like it.  That is the problem I worry about.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. While I certainly find transhumanism and progress worthwhile even<br>
if they will be used by a smaller subset of humanity, I would like to make<br>
it accessible to everyone. Maybe I'm a bleeding heart transhumanist :-)<br>

Good idea. One problem is that a teacher is just a half of the team, the <br>
student must be able to learn well too. And this might be hard to do if <br>
technology accelerates too much and we don't have good intelligence <br>
amplification systems. <br>
<p>
One of the things I have been thinking of is to create a "knowledge <br>
infrastructure" for people to learn in. After all, what we learn in <br>
school is quickly forgotten or obsolete, so we need to learn continually. <br>
The idea is to use the Net for "micro-course" you could take to orient <br>
yourself in a subject you briefly need (for example, today I needed <br>
to learn about Hidden Markov Models so that I could write a subsection of <br>
my thesis), helping you get a feel for what it is about. If you need <br>
deeper knowledge, you could enroll in more elaborate courses, both <br>
net-based and physical, or in classical education. The idea is to make <br>
learning accessible and possible in daily life; ideally everybody should <br>
learn new things continously throughout life, with few strictly <br>
educational or working periods. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Technology should be dead simple and yet still explain the underlying</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology/methods.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. This is the goal of much interface design, but it is a very hard <br>
problem. I fear that we might get nanotech and uploading long before <br>
somebody invents a truly good GUI. <br>
