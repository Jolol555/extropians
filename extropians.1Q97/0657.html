This is equivalent to the ASTM standard.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Stealth would play less a role for big rocks.  Since a big rock is just "a<br>
big rock" with no terminal guidance, and only kinetic energy as its energy<br>
source, there is little you can do to defend against it.  It is falling<br>
whether you like it or not.  The best you could do would be to modify the<br>
trajectory.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Just some quick comments on nuclear effects in the lunar environment:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I checked all my civil engineering books and others to get real figures and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; data.  Assume a nuclear device with a yield of 1-Mt, which is a a few times</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; higher than the actual average yield of the current arsenal.  An airburst</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would have virtually no effect in the lunar environment, so we will assume a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ground burst.  Assuming a theoretically perfect energy yield for a 1Mt</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; device, we have a total output of ~4*10^15 Joules.  However, the vast</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; majority of the energy is harmlessly radiated, since an atmosphere and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; surface living is required for these effects to have significance.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; significant destructive force is the ground shock.  Note that much of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ground shock energy found in atmospheric environments is airslap induced</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ground shock, and is therefore irrelevant.  I assumed a depth of 2-meters,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; since soil arching plays a significant role in shock resistance.  After much</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; nasty calculation based on the above values, you will be disappointed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; learn that the safe distance from ground zero is between 500-1000 meters for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a 1Mt surface burst, depending on soil conditions.  The reason is apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that virtually all the blast and cratering effects are consequences of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; having an atmosphere, and soil doesn't propagate shock waves very well.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fact, structures specifically hardened against nuclear blasts could survive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; quite near ground zero, since non-airslap induced ground shock is attenuated</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; extremely rapidly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Note that this is not an exact science, and that there are many factors</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; involved.  I was simply demonstrating that nuclear weapons lose most of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; their effectiveness in subterranean lunar environments.  Nuclear weapons are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hundreds of times more effective on earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thanks for a more expert opinion James. Based on a reference I found of</i><br>
<i>&gt;4.2 x 10^22 ergs per Megaton, I calculated 15 tons of TNT equiv. for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;1 ton rock, so while I was seriously wrong in my own estimate, Mark was</i><br>
<i>&gt;under by almost three times. I don't know why that number stuck in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;brain, I had read it somewhere...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Additionally, in terms of damage ability, large nukes have, even in</i><br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere, an attentuating effectivness proportionate with their yeild.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A 10 MT device will only have a damage area of between 4-8 times larger</i><br>
<i>&gt;than a 300 KT device, which is why the powers have gotten away from</i><br>
<i>&gt;using big nukes, as they are not as cost effective as using the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;amount of material in four or more devices.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The scaling factor for nuclear weapons is (Yield1/Yield2)^(1/3), where<br>
Yield1 and Yield2 are the yields of the nuclear devices in question.  This<br>
scaling factor is "ideal" for all explosives, nuclear or conventional.  The<br>
ideal case more or less holds up until about the 10Mt range, where the<br>
exponent starts to decrease slightly due to "real" factors.<br>
<p>
If you think about it, a cube root scaling factor makes perfect sense for<br>
scaling one dimensional energy values in 3D space.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For examply, a high altitude attack by 3-4 B-52s carrying conventional</i><br>
<i>&gt;2000 lb HE bombs can damage as much area as a 10-20 KT nuke, though</i><br>
<i>&gt;without the radiation effects. In fact, because the concussive</i><br>
<i>&gt;shockwaves are from dozens of sources, rather than one device, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually are more effective in their area of effectiveness.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The obvious reason for this being that a single large explosion is poorer at<br>
distributing destructive energy than many smaller explosions that have been<br>
spread out.  You maximize the area of optimal destructive energy.  Cluster<br>
bombs are designed with the same principle in mind.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, as James demonstrated, a big nuke htting a lunar target would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;much closer actual damage equivalence to a much smaller device hitting</i><br>
<i>&gt;an earth based target. While I do not know how to calculate the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;or estimated equivalence, I think that this is a significant factor to</i><br>
<i>&gt;consider.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we look at a more proportionate device, like the Oklahoma bombing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that device, I beleive was estimated to be equivalent to a ton of TNT</i><br>
<i>&gt;(please correct me with more accurate data).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Oklahoma bombing was not equivalent to a ton of TNT.  Although the truck<br>
carried an estimated 1-1.5 tons of explosive, my "expert" estimate would be<br>
a damage equivalence of about 1/4 ton of TNT based on the structural damage.<br>
There are a several reasons why this is the case:  <br>
<p>
1) They were using an Ammonal-4 type explosive composition.  These<br>
compositions have detonation velocities of 3000-3500 m/s, depending on exact<br>
composition and quality.  Detonation velocity significantly impacts the<br>
destructive capability of an explosive against building structures.  Had<br>
they been using TNT (detonation velocity ~7000 m/s) the damage would have<br>
been far worse.<br>
<p>
2) Ammonal-4 type explosive compositions typically exhibit incomplete<br>
detonation.  You rarely get the theoretical bang out of the explosive. <br>
<p>
3) Ammonium Nitrate based explosives are low energy explosives.  TNT is a<br>
mid-to-high energy explosive.  By their nature, TNT is significantly more<br>
destructive.<br>
<p>
<p>
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY IF I WAS A TERRORIST:<br>
<p>
I would have used nitromethane based racing fuel instead of diesel as a<br>
sensitizer/fuel.  Why?  Twice the detonation velocity, complete detonation,<br>
and energetics roughly equivalent to TNT.<br>
<p>
Fortunately for the world, if terrorists were educated, they would probably<br>
have a job other than terrorism.  Ironically, Ammonal-4 type explosives (the<br>
popular choice among terrorists) are poorly suited to building demolition.<br>
Had a suitable explosive had been used in the World Trade Center bombing,<br>
that building would not be standing. <br>
