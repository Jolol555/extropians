<i>&gt;From: Crosby_M &lt;CrosbyM@po1.cpi.bls.gov&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Date: Fri, 21 Mar 1997 12:37:10 -0500</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: UN Rights Declaration (was: Patents &amp; Human Rights)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;U.Sov. cites United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Article 27: Section 1: Everyone has right to freely participate in</i><br>
<i>&gt;cultural life of community, to enjoy arts and to share in scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;advancment and it's BENEFITS.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That gives me the right to a free ticket to Bali,</i><br>
<p>
What makes you think you require a ticket?<br>
Did you agree to that limitation?<br>
UN:UDHR:Articles 29.2, 20.2, 21.3, and 15.2 .<br>
UN:UDHR:13.1:<br>
"Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence <br>
within the borders of each state."<br>
It is unlawful to deny you the right to move into a plane and reside there<br>
while it flys to Bali.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;to watch some ceremonial dances there;</i><br>
<p>
UN:UDHR:Articles 19 and 26<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;then on to Cambodia to explore the ancient Khymer temples;</i><br>
<i>&gt;then on to India, and on and on. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;("each state.")</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does this cover other travel accommodations as well?</i><br>
<p>
That is quite possible.<br>
UN:UDHR:Articles 3, 5, 12, 16.3, 21.2, 22, 23.3, and 25.1 .<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As for scientific advancements and their benefits, </i><br>
<i>&gt;where do I apply for my free space station? </i><br>
<p>
I wish I knew.<br>
<p>
(I'd love to just kick back in orbit and watch the stars!) <br>
<p>
UN:UDHR:24<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does the U.N. have a space agency </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it has The United Nations' Office for Outer Space Affairs (OOSA).<br>
<a href="http://www.un.or.at/OOSA_Kiosk/index.html">http://www.un.or.at/OOSA_Kiosk/index.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;to handle such requests by all us individual 'sovereign nations'?  </i><br>
<p>
I do not know.<br>
<p>
There is no need to quote.<br>
UN:UDHR:Articles 5 and 12<br>
You are sovereign when you will it.<br>
When do you think the sovereign nation of the USA was formed,<br>
when a people made squiggly marks on paper, <br>
when they lost their lives,<br>
or when they, in their minds, willfully dissolved their political bonds <br>
and considered themselves their government?<br>
UN:UDHR:Articles 20.2, 15.2, 21.3<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who's going to be doing work while we're enjoying our culture?</i><br>
<p>
Those who will themselves to.<br>
Remember stargazing is also considered to be useful work.<br>
If no one had done it sailors may have had a very difficult time navigating.<br>
