<p>
We are at one! And I must say I've thoroughly enjoyed this 'debate'. I<br>
would only add the following minor comments, which are intended as<br>
rhetorical and reflexive, unless anyone has strong feelings about them.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe that fairy tales, and mythology are objective today, atleast not</i><br>
<i>&gt;in modern society. In the past perhaps, but today, no.</i><br>
<p>
I would qualify that to say, "at least not in Western society today". By<br>
either of our definitions of objectivism (see below) mythology may be<br>
objective in societies other than our own, which have no history of thought<br>
counter to mythology. (Actually, an individual in a society which does have<br>
a history of thought counter to mythology may be objective in his/her<br>
belief in mythology if he/she doesn't know of that contrary history.<br>
Objectivity cannot require knowledge of everything. Reaching a reasonable<br>
decision, on the other hand...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact that fairy tales and mythology are no longer objective does not</i><br>
<i>&gt;make them subjective.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting point: I would tend to say that any educated Western person who<br>
placed, say, astrology above statistics was not being objective. Yet can I<br>
validly say that? Is such a person's decision any more or less biased than<br>
my own belief in science (by your definition)? Or is such a person's<br>
decision giving any less priority to statements of others than my would (by<br>
my definition)? Tricky. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I define subjective statements as value judgements, and objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;statements as unbiased observations.</i><br>
<p>
I'd use the definitions whereby objectivism is the prioritization of<br>
existing corpuses of knowledge created by others in the reaching of a<br>
decision, whilst subjectivism prioritizes ones own thoughts. These are not<br>
disimilar to your definitions, but reflect my belief that (a) even<br>
objective decisions require at least the value judgement, 'The thoughts of<br>
others are valid to inform my decision,' and (b) there is bound to be bias<br>
in reaching an objective decision, even if only as to which 'others' one<br>
listens to as a priority (this bias allows me to place Western<br>
post-Enlightenment rationalism above Eastern mysticism, for example).<br>
<p>
<p>
Once again, thanks for the discourse, Gregory.<br>
<p>
