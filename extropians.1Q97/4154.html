I think that such possibilities depend on the interelationship of<br>
individual intelligence and sociability levels. For example, a highly<br>
individualistis, even viciously animistic species may reach interstellar<br>
capacity by having an extremely high individual intelligence. Such high<br>
individual capability may overcome a lack of ability to cooperate, and<br>
may be aided by extreme differentiation between the sexes, where the<br>
males would be extremely agressive, individualistic, and intelligent,<br>
while the females may be more cooperative, compliant, and submissive, so<br>
there would be a alpha male pack phenomenon with numerous female<br>
servants. Niven's Kzin are one example of this, though even they were<br>
described by Niven as having acquired their technology from another race<br>
involuntarily.<br>
<p>
Primitive agressive species may also gain interstellar capacity by<br>
acquiring advanced technology from other races who are not careful in<br>
their planetary activities (Niven's Kzin), and are either attacked, or<br>
lose technology due to vehicle crashes (shades of Roswell???). If such<br>
were the current case, it is considered one reason for the Great Filter<br>
question, as well as an explaination why our own government would not<br>
admit to acquiring technology, as a tv broadcast goes out into space and<br>
is basically an announcement to other races that we have acquired<br>
technology we may not be  prepared to handle, or may abuse in an<br>
expansionist way. Lack of radio signals from outside systems can easily<br>
be explained by current technology. We currently have the capabilty to<br>
jam EM broadcasts in a localized area, or jam broadcasts into an area<br>
without disturbing the broadcasts within the area, all without giving<br>
away a localized signature of the jamming source. If we can do this,<br>
certainly more advanced races could do the same to us on a solar system<br>
wide scale.<br>
