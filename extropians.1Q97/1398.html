That initial sense of disillusionment, in my case, can't compare with<br>
what follows.  To take your example, when you learn how a brush works,<br>
you can learn to paint.  On some level, you now know how it's done, and<br>
while it might take the wonder away from painters, suddenly YOU can be<br>
the painter, and create beautiful images yourself...<br>
<p>

<p>
I'll give an example.  It's a story.  Goes like this:<br>
<p>
When I was about six or seven, I saw a rainbow.  My family kept<br>
the lawn green with a hand-held sprinkler attached to a hose; as I<br>
looked out into it, I could see that a rainbow had formed in the mist.<br>
"Ah ha!" I thought to myself.  "All I have to do is go look where the<br>
rainbow strikes the ground, and I'll find a pot of gold!"  (Remember, I<br>
was small. :) )  Excited, I ran out into the sprinkler to make my<br>
fortune.  As I looked more closely, the rainbow didn't seem to hit the<br>
ground at all, but instead it stopped where the mist dispersed.<br>
Undaunted, I picked up the sprinkler to see if I could use the mist<br>
like a flashlight to find gold.  It worked!  As I aimed the mist, I<br>
followed the curve of the rainbow...  it was going down, then up, then<br>
down again, and...  "Hey!  This rainbow is a circle!"  I suddenly<br>
realized that all those who had told me about gold at the end of the<br>
rainbow were horribly deceived; "rainbows are circles," I concluded<br>
with an empirical air, "and circles don't have ends!"  <br>
<p>
Are rainbows less because you can make one with a hose and a hand-held<br>
sprinkler; because there's no gold at either "end?"  No.  Rather, we<br>
can learn from this story (and others like it) the beauty of<br>
creativity, and the power of the resourceful human mind.  That's the<br>
true discovery.  THAT'S what I learned that day.<br>
<p>
On a sunny day, I can go out and make a rainbow.  I can make rainbows<br>
because I can understand them.  Can this agnostic student say the same?<br>
