I asked:<br>
<i>&gt; Yes, of course part of what brings us together is an interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalist type political institutions. But why are so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of you so damn confident that you know how such things would actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; function, or which minute variation would actually be best?  </i><br>
<p>
Mark Grant responded:<br>
<i>&gt;For the same reason we were talking about a few weeks ago; authoritarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;forms of government allow for no opposing views, while libertarian forms</i><br>
<i>&gt;of government allow objectors to set up their own local government of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;kind as long as it's voluntary (or under AC if they have enough power to</i><br>
<i>&gt;coerce people into joining them). So if we set up a Friedman-like society</i><br>
<i>&gt;and it doesn't work we can always try something else. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is basically an engineering decision; authoritarian societies give</i><br>
<i>&gt;you many single points of failure which libertarian societies can eliminate. </i><br>
<i>&gt;If one PPL goes bad, that only affects a small group of people and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;majority can act to bring it back under control. </i><br>
<p>
The most common concern about PPLs is that is that local competition<br>
will soon result in local authoritarian monopolies, which may be<br>
difficult to get rid of.  This seems to be the result of protection<br>
agency like competition now in Russia.  Another concern is defense<br>
free riding among PPLs making an area vulnerable to invaders.  So it<br>
is not *obvious* we aren't better off with some sort of minarchy.  And<br>
given minarchy, its not obvious how small a government we can actually<br>
have.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Finally, how are PPAs supposed to recognize their customers? Do we all</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to wear big luminous jackets with their logos on or something? I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can see how to do it in a more advanced society (e.g. everyone has</i><br>
<i>&gt;implanted computers and radio-networking), but I'm not sure how we could</i><br>
<i>&gt;do it with current technology.</i><br>
<p>
This is also a real concern.  It doesn't do any good for my to buy<br>
stronger punishment against assault or robbery, if potential criminals<br>
don't know that I am different.  So houses covered by non-standard<br>
laws need to post a mark to this effect (as houses now covered by<br>
private patrols now do), and people on the street would need to wear<br>
some distinguishing mark if they want buy extra deterrence.<br>
