<i>&gt; What is to be done?</i><br>
<p>
    The Squirrel attempts to observe the list convention of not debating<br>
fundamentals, and will continue, yet he feels obliged to point out that<br>
the association of transhumanist technological goals with libertarian<br>
and anarcho-capitalistic political economics may be disadvantageous to<br>
both, and will certainly appear forced and unconvincing to persons who<br>
believe in one (whichever) but not the other.  Certainly there are many<br>
thoughtful persons who find no obvious connection between these two sets<br>
of ideas.<br>
<p>
    Thus, in the 1960s and 1970s, there were plenty of people much into<br>
the "turn on, tune in, take over" socialist vision of the time, who<br>
thought that strong government and massive centrally-funded programs<br>
were the best way to bring about advanced technologies, and who looked<br>
forward eagerly to doing just that after the "take over" part had been<br>
accomplished.  Many of those persons are still around, and are no doubt<br>
somewhere between bemused and pleased that a bunch of flakey<br>
libertarians (their hypothetical term, not one the Squirrel would use<br>
himself -- some of the Squirrel's best friends are libertarians...) have<br>
also finally figured out that high-tech is neat.  The Squirrel trusts<br>
that many of them will be at least open-minded enough to say, "Welcome,<br>
Extropians, to the wonderful world of technological optimism!  We need<br>
all the help we can get, even from clueless newbies like you."<br>
<p>
    But consider a person predisposed toward technological optimism, who<br>
does not think much of libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism.  There are<br>
lots of people who don't think much of libertarianism and<br>
anarcho-capitalism, so the Squirrel submits that this case is worth<br>
considering.  On first contact with Extropians, such a person might say,<br>
"Aw, it's just a bunch of libertarian kooks spewing -- it's not worth my<br>
time to listen to them."  One can miss out on a lot by labeling people<br>
"kooks", but on the other hand, when time is limiting, a being who has<br>
not transcended may perhaps be forgiven for seeking science in _Nature_<br>
rather than in _The_National_Enquirer_, even though the latter does get<br>
it right now and then.  Yet whether libertarians and anarcho-capitalists<br>
are kooky or not, the cause of technological optimism is thereby damaged<br>
by the association.<br>
<p>
    Similarly, a person leaning toward libertarianism, who did not think<br>
much of technological optimism, might dismiss Extropians as just a bunch<br>
of of technological optimist kooks spewing, and the cause of<br>
libertarianism would thereby be damaged.  There are lots of people who<br>
don't think much of technological optimism, so this case is also worth<br>
considering.<br>
<p>
    Thus to link technological optimism and transhumanist technological<br>
goals on the one hand, with libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism on the<br>
other, risks eliciting positive responses from only those persons<br>
already predisposed to both, and negative ones from nearly everybody<br>
else.  Yet there are probably far more people who look favorably on just<br>
one (whichever) of the two idea sets, than on both.<br>
<p>
    Thus a strategy for "what is to be done" might be to distance<br>
transhumanist technological goals from libertarianism and<br>
anarcho-capitalism, at least at the public-relations and educational<br>
interface to the rest of the non-transcended world.<br>
