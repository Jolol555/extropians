That's true, I can't show you such a case, nor can I show you a pure free                          <br>
market economy, the contagion of nationalism has spread to every square inch<br>
of the planet.<br>

<i>        &gt;strong positive feedback, and share this same characteristic. </i><br>
<p>
                <br>
A wonderful theory, but like all theories it must be compatible with the<br>
facts. Let's Look at the corporate giants of 25 years ago. A &amp; P  was by<br>
far the largest retailer on planet earth, today I think they still exist<br>
someplace but I wouldn't swear to it. Where is Eastern Airlines or Pan<br>
American or Control Data or Studebaker or Packard? It sounds ridiculous now,<br>
but just a few years ago many said that IBM should be prevented from entering<br>
the PC market because it would completely dominate it. Many of the giants of<br>
today like Microsoft, Walmart, Intel, Digital, Sun or Turner Broadcasting<br>
were tiny or non existent 25 years ago.  On the other hand we have the same<br>
damn governments we had 25 years ago and, in the USA at least, government<br>
controls a much larger percentage of the economy than it did then.<br>
<p>
Government, however minimal it starts off to be, will grow because it has<br>
advantages that no other power center has. A corporation, no matter how big,<br>
can not force you to consume their product and then pay for it, nor can a<br>
corporation force you to work for it. On the other hand, if government needs<br>
labor to serve on a jury or fight a war it makes no difference if you want<br>
to work for them or not, you must. If you don't want the services the<br>
government provides, you still must pay for them. The government will make<br>
you an offer you can't refuse, otherwise men with automatic weapons will come<br>
to your house knock on your door and drag you away.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There is little purpose in constructing a society of any kind if not </i><br>
<i>        &gt;for the benefit of the members of that society. I construct machines </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to be my slaves, not to be enslaved by them. The same should be true </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of anything we construct. </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Nobody understands themselves so they sure as hell don't understand the<br>
economy in which they live well enough to construct it to specifications.<br>
Imagine trying to calculate the price of an object from first principles,<br>
it would be like writing a book on auto repair using only the equations<br>
of Quantum Mechanics! Fortunately the market will tell you what the price<br>
is real quick.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;However, I cannot say that taking wealth away is unacceptable in</i><br>
<i>        &gt;every possible case.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree. Taking wealth away from other people and giving it to me is very<br>
acceptable, I find that everybody basically agrees with me about this, except<br>
they do want to make one modification. Personally I think that change destroys<br>
the beauty if of my original plan.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Economic polarization cannot go indefinately without some kind of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;corrective measure.  </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
And you expect government to provide that corrective measure? It's crazy to<br>
think government will be on the side of the weak, making friends with<br>
the powerless and making enemies of the powerful is no way for a politician<br>
to stay in power.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This is my model of what would happen with an economy that has zero</i><br>
<i>        &gt;governmental regulation.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Whenever there is talk about deregulating a section of the economy the loudest<br>
howls of protest come from the leaders of the industry being regulated.<br>
The regulation is there to stamp out competition and preserve the status quo,<br>
despite some wonderful rhetoric it has nothing to do with helping the weak.<br>
                             <br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;"Highest correlation of effort with reward" is something I would </i><br>
<i>        &gt; include in the definition of "fair".  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Effort is irrelevant. If would take enormous effort to learn to play the<br>
piano with you feet, but if you want to do it then go right ahead, however<br>
I feel not the slightest pang of guilt in not personally rewarding you for<br>
it.             <br>
               <br>
<i>        &gt;Some important problems will require specialized knowlege just to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;recognize them.  </i><br>
        <br>
True.        <br>
                    <br>
<i>        &gt;Free markets are not effective at solving such problems.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What are you talking about? Companies hire thousands of people with very<br>
specialized knowledge, and unlike government specialists, they are held<br>
accountable when their theories prove to be wrong.<br>
                <br>
I think the trouble in all this is that you're comparing the Free Market as<br>
it actually exists, warts and all, against a saintly omniscient government<br>
that ALWAYS knows what the right thing to do is, and even more important,<br>
ALWAYS has the moral courage to do it. It's not very surprising that the<br>
market comes out second best in such a mythical contest.<br>
                               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What I proposed was lowering the price to a level that would not</i><br>
<i>        &gt;allow you to compete and still remain profitable. I would lose money,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;but would not willingly incur any greater losses than were necessary.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The lower you set the price of widgets the greater will be the demand for<br>
them, the greater the demand the more widgets you must manufacture, the<br>
more you manufacture the more money you lose. I don't care how much money<br>
you have, if it is finite, this sequence can only end one way. <br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In the proposed scenario, I am the one with the vast resources.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And you are assuming that my resources are close to zero, if so that means<br>
that very little money is needed to get into the widget business so even if<br>
you get rid of me a thousand new competitors will soon spring up. If it takes<br>
a lot of money to make widgets then my financial resources must be<br>
significant.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Even if you buy them from me you still have to market and distribute</i><br>
<i>        &gt;them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, but the beauty is that every widget I buy from you makes you weaker, <br>
and you are my competition.<br>
<p>
I have to ask, do you really think this is a good way to make money, would<br>
you use your hard earned savings to buy stock in a corporation that tried to<br>
corner a market in this manner? If so I'd like to talk to you about investing<br>
in my perpetual motion machine company.<br>
