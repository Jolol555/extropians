QM&gt; Whilst they are working at it, I would hope that they would set their <br>
QM&gt; sights a mite higher than the usual Fabio ouvre.  I mean, if we could <br>
QM&gt; SEE brains, I think a lot more heads would turn on the street.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps the most expedient way to do that is with a personal web page?<br>
After all, it is not the physical appearance of the brain that one is<br>
interested in, and if it were, that's easy to fake.  One's body of<br>
written work (or artwork, or invention) is hard to fake--in fact it's<br>
possible to verify with crypto-signatures, and gives direct insight<br>
into the mental processes that created them.  It could easily become<br>
a standard of social activity to exchange URLs instead of phone numbers.<br>
<p>
If you'll excuse me, I'd better go update my site now...<br>
