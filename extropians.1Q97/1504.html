<i>&gt;&gt;&lt;big snip of how the brain isn't getting any bigger&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;the same size for thousands of years; what hasn't stayed the same is how</i><br>
<i>&gt;people use their brains.  Those who are geniuses are as such because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to maximize their potential.  But considering that very little of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;brain is actually used for thought processes etc., there is little doubt in</i><br>
<i>&gt;my mind (pun intended) that there is much room for evolutionary improvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many people who have partial lobectomies and\or lobotomies are still very</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligent, though theoretically, the area of their brains are smaller.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same effect, most half-wits have a normal sized brain.  In the end, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;not the size that counts, but how you use it.  ;~)</i><br>

There was a sidebar in a psychology book I once read about a 19th century<br>
Englishman who died of cancer or something quite suddenly.  His long-time<br>
friend, a doctor, did the autopsy and was amazed to discover that his friend<br>
was missing the vast majority of one the hemispheres in his brain.  There<br>
was nothing about the man's behavior or intelligence that would have<br>
suggested that he was missing nearly half of his brain.  <br>
<p>
Obviously architecture is more important than size.  Ten million transistors<br>
does not equal a computer.<br>
