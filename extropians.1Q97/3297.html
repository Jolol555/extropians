Dementia is not a disease; it's a symptom, and it's quite common with<br>
anything affecting the brain, as many diseases do.  Also, AIDS dementia is<br>
often relatively mild and would be hard to detect in something that can't<br>
talk (like an experimental ape).<br>
<p>
Wasting syndrome is not a disease; it's a symptom.  It's also common with<br>
chronic gastrointestinal problems, which many AIDS patients have.<br>
<p>
Many cancers, including cervical cancers and lymphomas, can be caused by<br>
viruses.  Remember what the original name for HIV (HTLV-III) stood for?  The<br>
immune system may not be responsible for fighting the cancer cells, but it's<br>
definitely responsible for fighting the virus that makes the cell cancerous.<br>
<p>
The causal agent for Kaposi's isn't currently known; it isn't HIV, but its<br>
higher incidence rates amongst homosexuals with AIDS than amongst hemophiliac<br>
indicate an agent capable of sexual transmission.  Its absence amongst<br>
immunodeficient apes shouldn't surprise anybody.<br>
<p>
(Unless the apes have been going to gay disco bars and scoring :-)<br>
