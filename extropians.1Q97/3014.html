<i>&gt; To my knowledge there are several projects underway which would attempt </i><br>
<i>&gt; to create such societies:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. The Atlantis Project (<a href="http://www.oceania.org">http://www.oceania.org</a>) aims to create an </i><br>
<i>&gt; island.  As far as I can tell, this one just kinda mysteriously stopped </i><br>
<i>&gt; about 2 years ago.</i><br>
<p>
Eric is still around, and the web pages are still there.  He hasn't<br>
printed the passports or done some other things in the plan, but he<br>
still has the big model and still has copies of the Constitution and<br>
other literature, I believe.  The project took a bad hit when we<br>
bought a much larger model than planned, and then donations dried up.<br>
That left us in debt, and unable to continue advertising and doing<br>
other promotional things until the model was paid off.  I left to get<br>
a "real" job; the other co-founders are out of touch.  I think there<br>
is still some hope left for this one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. The Laissez Faire City (<a href="http://www.lfcity.com/">http://www.lfcity.com/</a>) project takes a </i><br>
<i>&gt; different tack, and is planning to obtain a 100-year lease of a parcel of </i><br>
<i>&gt; land from some host country.  I assume they've done their homework and </i><br>
<i>&gt; are confident that such a property could be run/operated independently </i><br>
<i>&gt; from the host country.  They also claim to have established an "interim </i><br>
<i>&gt; community" in Costa Rica which allows members to live tax free.  All of </i><br>
<i>&gt; which sounds interesting, but I have a gut-level suspicion of any group </i><br>
<i>&gt; that asks me to pay $35 for additional "research materials."</i><br>
<p>
Don't know much about this one.  At least when the AP sold Constitutions,<br>
we told you up front that you were paying $30 for a paperback editition<br>
of a document you could download for free :)  Does LFC tell you what you<br>
get for that $35?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3. The Millenial Project (<a href="http://www.millennial.org">http://www.millennial.org</a>), has a comprehensive </i><br>
<i>&gt; plan for "colonizing the galaxy in 8 easy steps."  One of the beginning </i><br>
<i>&gt; stages involves building ocean colonies.  In addition, the members of one </i><br>
<i>&gt; of their chapters are currently planning a land-based colony to research </i><br>
<i>&gt; the social and environmental aspects of living together in a group </i><br>
<i>&gt; (<a href="http://www.neca.com/~dimitri/lbc.html">http://www.neca.com/~dimitri/lbc.html</a>).  While the folks at TMP are not </i><br>
<i>&gt; explicitly libertarian, from what I've seen they lean towards strong </i><br>
<i>&gt; protection of individual rights for their colonists.</i><br>
<p>
AP and MP have exchanged technical information on oceanic construction<br>
and desalinization and such, and they do in fact have a fair membership<br>
overlap with AP, so are likely to be libertarian whether they like it<br>
or not.  My impression of the other folks there is that they are non-<br>
political technophiles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you feel that a libertarian society can be realized by working within </i><br>
<i>&gt; the political system to change existing governments, or do you feel that </i><br>
<i>&gt; such a society can only be realized by starting fresh from scratch?</i><br>
<p>
I think there is one way to do it from the inside: to form the nation (i.e.<br>
the people) before you form the country (i.e., the land).  Accumulate a<br>
group, each of which pledges to never use force against any other member,<br>
and slowly build that group into economic self-sufficiency (cybercash and<br>
similar technologies help a lot here) so that the government of the land<br>
they occupy simply atrophies, or sells itself off to us.  It may take<br>
decades, even generations, but I think it would work to both free us and<br>
allow us to keep our land.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a </i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarian colony?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks in advance.  Hope this helps to turn our discussions towards the </i><br>
<i>&gt; more practical aspects of libertarianism.</i><br>
<p>
I would, and I have.  Personally, though, I am unlikely to discuss the<br>
"practical" ascpects of libertarianism, as I do not look at liberty as<br>
an end result, but rather as a prior condition; a means, not an end.<br>
