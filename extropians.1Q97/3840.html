In a message dated 97-03-22 09:45:16 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  The lunch ended on a very <br>
 sour note and I fear my friendship is mortally wounded. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
My first impression would be to try and get my friend out of clinical<br>
unipolar depression.  It does not matter how educated, scientifically<br>
literate or "smart" the person is.  This person is depressed.  See Martin<br>
Seligman's book _Learned Optimism_.    <br>
 <br>
My second impression is to let my friend think anything and say anything AND<br>
IF that interferes with my own thinking, which this friend has done:  Drop<br>
that person until the clinical unipolar depression subsides and that person<br>
and I see eye-to-eye again.  See Harry Brown's book _How I found Freedom In<br>
an Unfree World_.  The book exposes traps of intellect that your depressed<br>
friend has sprung on you. <br>
 <br>
I have a concern for friends like this and will try one but _only_one_<br>
attempt to help them.  (This happened recently with a person I have known for<br>
over 20 years in Florida.  I sent her one page of information that could have<br>
helped her.  She would not even read that one page.  I called and tried to<br>
get her to read it and she refused.)   After that they must take<br>
responsibility for their own mental or physical health.  I am too busy<br>
running my own life to spent time on their problems.  I will not drag them to<br>
see a doctor, that's physical force.  I just will NOT do it, even for a<br>
friend! <br>
 <br>
I consider this person so far away from my thinking that I can't spend time<br>
with that person's deathist contamination. . . too many negative memes around<br>
and I could get brainwashed by negativity. <br>
 <br>
It sounds like you have already been brainwashed by this person's own<br>
clinical depression.  Now it's YOUR responsibility not to get dragged into<br>
the same depression.<br>
 <br>

Dynamically Optimistic,<br>
