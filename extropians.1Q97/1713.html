<i>&gt;random, wandering footprints.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our memories are in the reinforcement of certain pathways and the signals </i><br>

<i>&gt;all.   Look at all the millions of details of the scene around you; you can </i><br>

<i>&gt;millions of minute details around you, all the subtle shadings textures and </i><br>
<i>&gt;colors.  If you close your eyes, you will quickly forget almost everything.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;You may remember certain *general* things, but nearly *all* of the detail is </i><br>
<i>&gt;lost; you can no longer see the scene with the same vivid clarity that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;did </i><br>
<i>&gt;with your eyes open.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our memories are not *records* of the past, they are the ways we have adapted </i><br>

Beautiful description, David.  On the other hand, here's a poser: have<br>
you ever had one of those experiences in which a memory from the past<br>
comes unbidden at an odd moment, a memory that captures vividly the sense<br>
of presence of an occasion you may not have thought about for years?<br>
<p>
This phenomenon has always intrigued me, as has a distinct memory I have<br>
(and remember having) of one day standing on the steps coming out of the<br>
church with my family when I must have been about 5 or 6 and thinking "Oh<br>
shit, I've got to go through all this growing up stuff again!".  ( Like,<br>
it really felt as if I had been alive before and gone through growing up<br>
before.)<br>
<p>
Of course, these could be just anomalies, but they don't *feel* like<br>
anomalies; and feelings aren't necessarily always to be scorned.<br>
