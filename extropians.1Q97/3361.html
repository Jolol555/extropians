<p>
You say WE alot.<br>
As for government being a requirement I agree.<br>
Even an "anarchy" is a bunch of sovereigns.<br>
I have declared my sovereignty <br>
and consider the law of the nature of the universe my government.<br>

<p>
We could.<br>
We are particles.<br>
Propulsion systems are particles too.<br>
I once saw a picture of a UFO tracked by military forces<br>
that looked very much like a flaming humanoid.<br>

<p>
Failure means it was not done right.<br>

<i>&gt;We are so incredibly unaware of ourselves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are many people who are aware of their pulse and their breathing, </i><br>
<i>&gt;people who can even modify their pulse by merely thinking about it, </i><br>

Be afraid/calm.<br>
I went from 110 to 136 beats/minute in 3 seconds lying still on my back.<br>
I repeated this 3 times and had one witness.<br>
I probably had 150 when I was not looking.<br>
It was quite an experience.<br>
I wonder if hospitals keep records of ECGs.<br>

I used to wear a black wool trenchcoat year round.<br>
I live in Florida.<br>

<i>&gt;Nature is pretty damn cool, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but if I had several billion years, I think I could create</i><br>
<i>&gt;something a hell of a lot cooler. </i><br>
<p>
Are your actions not natural?<br>
Coolness is determined by subjective value projected upon it.<br>
Change your values and you can enjoy anything as much as you like.<br>
Oddly enough white walls can be quite erotic. :-)<br>
<p>
Relax.<br>
<p>
Take a deep comforting breath.<br>
<p>
Relax.<br>
<p>
Take a long slow blink.<br>
<p>
Now I present some views of subjective/objective reality.<br>
They are a bit unorganized but here it goes.<br>
Subjective reality is the reality the subject sees.<br>
The subject sees what it sees, <br>
so any reality seen is subjective.<br>
Objectivity exists only if the subject viewing it is the objective.<br>
<p>
Is it possible for a subject to be objective?<br>
I do what I do based on the law of the nature of the universe.<br>
I live in nature. <br>
My actions are simply reactions to stimuli provided by nature <br>
from within and without.<br>
An action and reaction are one continuous action.<br>
If it was not we could not believe in any action <br>
larger than the smallest particle interaction.<br>
No longer would an atom exist, <br>
for it is the sum of the actions of it's particles <br>
which have banded together.<br>
The universe is one action [uni = one, verse = turn].<br>
My action is the action of nature <br>
because none of my parts exist outside the influence of nature.<br>
I can not seperate my action of being from the action of the universe.<br>
If it did not exist I would not exist.<br>
If I did not exist it would not be what it is. <br>
As far as I would be concerned it would not exist.<br>
<p>
Speaking of not existing, think of this.<br>
Matter and energy can not be created nor destroyed.<br>
I am matter and energy.<br>
Therefore I can not be created nor destroyed.<br>
I was not born, I will not die.<br>
I have seen a baby with a brain stem and no brain.<br>
It acted like a normal sentient baby.<br>
Taking this into account is brain death really accurate?<br>
When does it begin or end?<br>
I do not think it does.<br>
<p>
I want to present enough evidence to convince everyone  <br>
but I tire of writing this.<br>
I hope some one learns some thing.<br>
Feel free to let me prove your arguments wrong.<br>
How's that for dynamic optimism?<br>
