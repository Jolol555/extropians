Well, it's time for me to wrap this thread up.<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste is (sorry!) becoming almost eerily similar to Searle at<br>
this point - evasive, refusing to answer direct questions, making fun of<br>
(and misinterpreting) the opposing position, and always claiming that<br>
the answers are obvious.  I am sure you'd get a similar answer if you<br>
asked Searle what the hell "causal powers" are, why they don't exert any<br>
detectable influence on our neurons, and if so, how Searle found out<br>
about them.  "Causal powers are there, and to say they aren't, is a<br>
disorder of the affects.  Breathe in the fresh air.  How can you say you<br>
don't have causal powers?"<br>
<p>
John K Clark's argument is harder to grasp and counter, but I can still<br>
try.  There's joy in life, and then there's blind joy in life.  I enjoy<br>
Bach, but I am not afraid to question the value of my enjoyment.<br>
<p>
Is the Meaning of Life *really* 42?  Why should the Meaning of Life be<br>
"survival" if the survival goal has genetic default value +42, and<br>
"death" if the same goal has a value of -42?  I refuse to give one<br>
arbitrary number such power over my life!<br>
<p>
Simple arbitrary things aren't answers, they're evasive actions.  I<br>
don't believe in Searle's "causal powers".  They're too arbitrary.  I<br>
don't believe in Chalmers's irreducible qualia.  They're too simple. <br>
Take your flowchart for "consciousness", John K Clark, and apply it to<br>
"value"!<br>
<p>
Am I out of contact with my emotions?  Not at all.<br>
In fact, I am a True Zen Master &lt;tm&gt;.<br>
<p>
Observe this [true] koan:<br>
<p>
Eliezer was explaining the Meaning of Life to a novice.<br>
"Really," he said, "I know the Meaning of Life."<br>
<p>
"What is it?" asked the novice, who was skeptical.<br>
<p>
"It is -" began Eliezer, but suddenly sneezed.<br>
<p>
And the novice was enlightened.  In fact, she was enlightened so hard<br>
she had trouble breathing.  And thus Eliezer knew he was a True Zen<br>
Master.<br>
