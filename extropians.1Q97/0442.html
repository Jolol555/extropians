Probably they will be so strange we do not even fear them. We seem to have<br>
built-in sensors for body parts (see Furchter, _Memory in the Crebral<br>
Cortex_; much seem to lie in the inferotemporal region) like hands, faces<br>
and breasts; guessing based on the prevalence of various phobias,<br>
observation of my cat and how we react to simple graphics suggests that we<br>
have snake, worm and "small critter"-detectors. <br>
<p>
A true alien might not fit our detectors, and look so utterly different <br>
that we will not immediately have a reaction. Imagine something that <br>
looks like a glittering cloud with fractal shells - it is too weird <br>
to mean anything to us. Of course, evolution might converge; if they <br>
evolved on a planet it would be quite possible that they too have <br>
articulated legs, for example. But we do not know if most aliens are from <br>
planets... maybe most are eganesque polysaccharide carpets or vortex <br>
intelligences. <br>

<i>&gt; Someone on this mailinglist once told me that the human brain can</i><br>

<p>
I urge you to be very sceptical to all claims of this type; human memory <br>
isn't directly convertible to bits and bytes. We remember things as <br>
semantic nets (or something even stranger), where each node or arc <br>
doesn't have a predefined information content (and can themselves contain <br>
lesser semantic strucures?). No human has ever run out of memory, since <br>
as we learn more old memories gradually fade or are integrated into new <br>
memories. <br>
<p>
My guess is that the size of our memory isn't due to a need for lots of <br>
memory, it may be the result of our large brains. Much of our thinking <br>
is really remembering/encoding, so our memory is really just an aspect of <br>
our intelligence. (This is also along the lines of Furchter's research; <br>
he is quite heavy but interesting reading). <br>
<p>
What is important for uploading is of course not what is in our minds but <br>
how large computers are enough to copy them. Then you have to estimate <br>
the information density, even if we cannot untangle the memories.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another thing I'm beginning to find is that I continue to come upon Ralph</i><br>
<i>&gt; Merkle's name constantly in all these publications. (This month's wired in</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Evolution Revolution", Neil Stephenson's Diamond Age where there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; structure called "Merkle Hall", and multiple references to him in those</i><br>
<i>&gt; USAF 2025 archives to name a few). Seems he's turning into quite a nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; celebrity, glad to have him here. Where is he anyways? I haven't seen him</i><br>
<i>&gt; around for awhile.</i><br>
<p>
Apropos nanocelebrities, what is Drexler doing novadays? Working on <br>
Nanosystems II?<br>
