At 11:57 PM 3/19/97 -0500, Carwash babbled back to my<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;No doubt Terry Bisson, author of this play, would find it hilarious that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;his work is being stolen and disseminated from list to list without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;acknowledgement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's true, most artists, especially writers, hate having large amounts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;people being exposed to their work. [...] Artists hate being heard.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm glad you made that point.</i><br>
<p>
Sigh.  I suppose I have to spell this out: <br>
<p>
While writers do enjoy having people exposed to their work, most prefer to<br>
have their names associated with the work in question, and since most earn<br>
their living by their writing they detest and resent having their work<br>
stolen.  (I except writers of tracts, advertisements and political<br>
speeches.)  The posting on this list of Bisson's `They're Made of Meat!'<br>
does not escape this stricture: if his name, and the title of the piece,<br>
had been included in the re-post, along with his express permission, I<br>
wouldn't have complained.<br>
