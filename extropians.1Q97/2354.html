To be blunt, your Microsoft mail program seems very badly designed. This<br>
message is almost impossible to decipher because it's not conforming to<br>
long-established Internet standards such as quoting and line-breaks. The<br>
only way I can tell which parts of the message are quotes and which are<br>
your responses is by the way that the quotes have line-breaks and your<br>
comments don't. The program also appends 7k+ of meaningless junk onto the<br>
end of each message, wasting my disk space, adding to my download time,<br>
and making Pine include MIME garbage when I reply. All hail Microsoft for <br>
yet again attempting to impose their ideas on the rest of us. <br>
<p>
You are, of course, free to claim that our software is broken, but if you<br>
intend to communicate with someone then it is your responsibility to do so<br>
in a manner they can understand. Your weirdly formatted messages have proven <br>
so difficult to understand that recently I've just been deleting them. It<br>
probably looks wonderful to someone using another Microsoft mail program,<br>
but it looks like nonsense to me.<br>

You're not David Brin posting under a pseudonym, are you? We did all this <br>
in December.<br>
