I haven't read Coase's original work, just Friedman's essay on his web<br>

unnecessary, just that exercising them would take more analysis and<br>
consideration.  LA auto pollution?  Widespread atmospheric pollution?<br>

I hope you realize that I'm not an inherent fan of government, but the<br>
evolutionary evidence for the viability of completely free societies is<br>
close to nil.  Saga-era Iceland has been offered as an example; whatever<br>
the extent of that freedom, Iceland lost a lot of it after a century or<br>
two.  It will take strong arguments to convince people to change<br>
systems, and in the meantime I do not think it ill to attempt to<br>
ameliorate the effects and modes of governance.<br>

One item is that peaceful voluntary disgovernance involves something like <br>
forcing Congress to disband.  It might be easier to force a replacement<br>
of Congress with a random government, and then to convince those<br>
legislators to disband, as they would have less personal stake in their<br>
power.<br>

... The Anarchists' [national] anthem is an international anthem that<br>
consists of 365 raspberries blown in very quick succession to the tune<br>
of "Camptown Races".  Nobody has to stand up for it, nobody has to<br>
listen to it, and, even better, nobody has to play it.<br>
