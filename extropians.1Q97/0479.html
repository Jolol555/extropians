Natasha and I went to the Wired 4th anniversary party on Tuesday and had a<br>
very fun time. I was pleased to find that not only is extropianism well<br>
known around the Wired offices, but there seem to be quite a few fans (and<br>
one fellow who said he was a "semi-fan"!).<br>
<p>
One of these was David Pescovitz who has, with Brad Weiners (another<br>
pleasant fellow) put together a book called Reality Check. This uses the<br>
info from the Wired column of the same name, but represents the information<br>
in an accessible and new form. I recommend it as a good, quick source to<br>
check some experts estimates of interesting technological advancements.<br>
There's even a good section on cryonics. Reality Check is published by<br>
HardWired.<br>
