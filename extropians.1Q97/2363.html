Yes, this whole EC "pressure" thing is ruining my plans of trying to figure<br>
out what territorial claims Belgium had on Denmark, and agitate some<br>
against your country in hopes of making a political career quickly. For<br>
which the time is perfect, with all this long dorment nationalism being<br>
revived by anti europe movements...  <br>

Sorry, didn't mean this one, i believe in the self determination right of<br>
nations, and peoples within, and individuals within, i just hope<br>
individualist ideals are not being confused with nationalist ones. <br>

I think Europe might be formed a lot more 'capitalistic' and a lot less<br>
'socialistic'  than you think: The Germans have the most money, so they'll<br>
probably decide most of what Europe will look like...<br>

<i>&gt;I think that the best we can do is to spread the Transhuman idea, &gt;and</i><br>
then let people find out for themself why the EU is a bad idea.<br>
<p>
Why be anti-EU, and not anti-national state  ? Maybe on a European level we<br>
can acchieve some of our goals. Less you want that fourth colony on the<br>
mars to be French or German instead of european ofcourse...<br>
