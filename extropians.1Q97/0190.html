<p>
I don't think anybody knows. <br>
<p>
But I have a theory: while there is differences between the left and the<br>
right hemisphere, they are really quite similar to each other, the same<br>
wiring so to say, just different uses and specializations. And<br>
corresponding parts of the brain are practically always connected by some<br>
fibers passing through the corpus callossum. The speech recognition center<br>
(Wernicke's area) is usually said to lie on the left side, closely linked<br>
to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe. But the corresponding area on<br>
the right side is also used, and according to one neuroscientist I asked<br>
it seems to be involved with understanding the emotional content of speech<br>
- the left hemisphere deals with the semantics, while the right with tone<br>
of voice, rhythm etc. <br>
<p>
I have also read about people with right hemisphere damage who suffer from<br>
amusia - the inability to understand music, and there are cases of people<br>
who loose their ability to understand tonality. So my theory is that music<br>
interacts with the right temporal lobe and the right speech area, both to<br>
provide a pleasing pattern and to say something emotionally, without<br>
having to go through any semantic processing on the way. <br>
<p>
Still, I might be wrong, since apparently there is at least one patient<br>
with temporal lobe underactivity that can understand and enjoy music (<br>
<a href="http://dunkel.ucdavis.edu/~kussmaul/research-cogneuro.html;">http://dunkel.ucdavis.edu/~kussmaul/research-cogneuro.html;</a> the page <br>
contains a lot of interesting research about audition), although her case <br>
is a bit complicated. <br>
<p>
The temporal lobe also contains hippocampus, amygdala and the enteroshinal<br>
cortex, parts of the limbic systems that definitely are strongly linked<br>
with emotion (and hormones). Exactly how everything is linked to<br>
everything else is still a big question, but I think we can be certain of<br>
that there are links here, somewhere. That lobe is filled with some of the<br>
greatest mysteries the brain has to offer! <br>
<p>
Apropos the neurology of music and the temporal lobe:<br>
<p>
Being a visual person I have always seen pictures when I listen to music,<br>
abstract images moving and changing according to the flow (Scriabin is a<br>
golden glow, Jarre's "Revolution" as a mushroom shape in a neon swamp, the<br>
chorus of Beethoven's ninth symphony as a scaly golden fractal dragon<br>
coiling in a great helix); this seems to be somewhat akin to synesthesia,<br>
but not exactly the real thing. <br>
<p>
True synesthesia, "seeing sounds" or "tasting images" seem to be related<br>
to the temporal lobe and also improved memory and ecstasy. See<br>
