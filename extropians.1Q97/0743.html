          My first mailing seems not to have made it to the list, so I <br>
          try reposting it:<br>

          Yes, this is very sad. I can only say that the sort of <br>
          government that engages in aggressive warfare is not the <br>
          sort of government that I would authorize to use nanotech <br>
          with potential military applications. This would rule out <br>
          many governments, but in the western democratic world there <br>
          seems to have been some improvement. In any case, the <br>
          nuclear powers have succeded for 50 years to abstain from <br>
          using the bomb. And best of all, the UN itself has a rather <br>
          saintlike history, most of its activity being devoted to do <br>
          good to others.<br>
          <br>
          UN seems to be the power least likely to use weapons of mass <br>
          destruction for unfair aggressive warfare, if it possessed <br>
          them.<br>
          <br>
          And the share limitation of the *number* of agents, <br>
          excluding all individuals and all rough states (and possibly <br>
          all nation states) from the control of technologies that <br>
          could be used to cause massive destruction, would also <br>
          increase the odds that we can avoid the disaster.<br>

<i>          &gt;should the Russian government be allowed to develop </i><br>

          <br>
          If it were feasible to prevent the Russians from doing so, <br>
          then it would probably be good if they were excluded from <br>
          military nanotech. If it were feasible to prevent the <br>
          Chechenyans and not the Russians, then I think that we <br>
          should prevent the Chechenians and hope that the Russians <br>
          would abstain from using it (just as they abstained from <br>
          using nukes). In some cases there may be a powerbalance <br>
          between two nations which would make it unwise to exclude <br>
          one of them from nanotech if it weren't possible to exclude <br>
          the other too.<br>
