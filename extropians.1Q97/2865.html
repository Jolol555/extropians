John?  Sure, Murdoch's paper might be readable.  But say it costs $.50<br>
to produce, at which price I prefer to read a different paper.  But when<br>
Murdoch's paper is free, I'm willing to read it instead of the paper I<br>
have to pay for.  Eventually that paper goes out of business and Murdoch<br>
starts charging $.50 again.  Now I'd like to read something better, but<br>
the competitor is out of business, and if it is non-trivial to start a<br>
new paper I may be stuck with reading Murdoch or nothing.  So I read<br>
Murdoch.  Not an ideal solution.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying what should be done about it, or that something should be<br>
done, but it does seem to be a sub-ideal solution at least, and if you<br>
can't disprove that you should acknowledge it, or people you'd like to<br>
convince will think you're a nut and not listen to you.<br>
