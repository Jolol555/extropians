In a message dated 97-01-09 05:53:24 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I would commission a world, perhaps housed in a big block of diamondoid<br>
 nanoprocessors or something similar that showed views from it on all<br>
 sides. The tricky part is that I would demand that the laws of nature in<br>
 the world would give rise to complexity just as high or higher than in our<br>
 world; the artwork would evolve and develop on its own, and the viewers<br>
 would see how it unfolded. Something like the Autoverse in _Permutation <br>
 City_, or the alife simulations mentioned in _The Broken God_.<br>
<i> &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
is this a mini- world? <br>
