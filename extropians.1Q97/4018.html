<i>&gt; From what I've read on Bayesian inference, judgements not based on Bayesian</i><br>
<i>&gt; methods or methods with indistinguishable results are objectively bad.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; most people are using an objectively inferior inference process, what does</i><br>
<i>&gt; that do to the value of other people's opinions for a rational Bayesian?</i><br>
<p>
The only judgments where non-Bayesian inferences are "objectively bad"<br>
in your sense are ones that are trivially simple and contrived to fit<br>
the mathematical models exactly.  For example, gambling.  Let us<br>
imagine a bag filled with red and black balls.  We are asked to bet<br>
on whether a ball drawn from the bag will be red or black, but we are<br>
not told beforehand how many of each are in it.  After each draw, the<br>
ball is replaced and we make another bet.  The conditions of the game<br>
are given and fixed, and our observations are trusted--guarantess that<br>
most of reality doesn't give us.  Under these conditions, a bettor<br>
using Bayesian inference to infer the number of red and black balls<br>
will, in the long run, always make more money than someone using any<br>
other method (we are also given that cheating is impossible).  Only<br>
in that limited sense is Bayes "ideal", but that tells us little that<br>
is useful; it only tells us that this formula works where we have<br>
defined the conditions for it to work, nothing more.<br>
<p>
By what rational means do we apply the precise mathematical model of<br>
Bayes to items in the real world, especially when those items are as<br>
obscenely complex and chaotic as human ideas?  Is that foundation any<br>
stronger than our earlier application of the calculus of Newton to the<br>
real world of gravitation, a much simpler mapping?  This is just a<br>
dressed-up version of the problem of induction.  Why do think induction<br>
works?  Because it usually does--an inductive argument.  If we are to<br>
judge whether or not Bayesian inference can be applied to certain parts<br>
of the real world, what criteria will we use to judge the evidence?  If<br>
you can offer me nothing better than Bayesian inference from that<br>
evidence, then I am unsatisfied.<br>
