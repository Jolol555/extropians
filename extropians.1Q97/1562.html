[John K Clark reluctantly admits:]<br>
<i>&gt; For me It's still hard for me for it to sink in that an otherworldly object  </i><br>
<i>&gt; like a Quantum computer could actually exist in our worldly universe, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's beginning to look like one can really be built. If so the world will </i><br>
<i>&gt; never be the same.</i><br>
<p>
After wrestling with temptation, I have decided not to gloat, and shall<br>
confine myself to repeating that there's absolutely no reason why<br>
quantum computing should be impossible or even difficult.<br>
<p>
We now have:<br>
1)  Coherent beams of atoms;<br>
2)  Quantum computers (for protein-folding simulations), Maybe This<br>
Year;<br>
3)  Wide-area STP, Maybe This Year.<br>
<p>
How long do you think it will be before all these methods of<br>
manipulating atoms stack up into the ability to build three-dimensional<br>
structures?<br>
My guess:  Not long.  I sure hope we're ready, or that we can get that<br>
way Real Fast.<br>
<p>
I told you this was going to be the year all hell broke loose, although<br>
admittedly even I wasn't expecting this much hell, this early, in the<br>
field of nanotechnology no less.  Well, isn't that the way it always<br>
is?  This is shaping up to be an exciting year, and the breakthroughs I<br>
was projecting in cognitive science haven't even happened yet.<br>
<p>
Sleep lightly; the assemblers arrive tomorrow.<br>
