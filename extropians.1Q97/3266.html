<i>&gt; No disagreement here, really.  The time period that I was referring to </i><br>
<i>&gt; starts pre-cambrian.  Human history is only a tiny part of it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Human genes are greatly the result of the evolution of pre-human critters.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The vast majority of that time there was no wealth, unless clams got money.</i><br>
<p>
While much of the evolution of morphology might be pre-human, almost<br>
all of the evolution of /behavior/ likely happened after we took the<br>
basic shape now doing the behaving.  Perhaps most of the perceptions<br>
evolved before that, but muscular behaviors and social behaviors must<br>
have evolved much later, after our muscles and groups looked more like<br>
the ones we have now.  Behavioral evolution is very fast.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The point that I was trying to make was that, if we treat DNA as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; language, there are no words in the human genome for 'rich', and</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably insufficient syntax to talk about riches.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; True, but not sufficient.  Yes, behaviors can be encoded.  However wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not a behavioral concept.  It is a social construction, and there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no definite connection between behavior and wealth.  Wealth-recognizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; or wealth-producing behavior in one society doesn't always work in another.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; The very fact that the correlation between wealth and family size is </i><br>
<i>&gt; cross-cultural is therefore proof that it isn't genetic.  QED.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, no sale.  All it proves is that the particular kind of wealth<br>
measured in the study was probably not the same as what caused the result.<br>
To postulate some genetic cause, you would indeed have to have some<br>
less culturally-biased measure that happens to correlate with wealth.<br>
Obesity seems like the obvious one.  That's something common to the<br>
wealthy in every primitive society and most modern ones.  Or free time.<br>
Maybe some gene has the effect of supressing sex drive when one is<br>
sedentary, so those people who had lots of free time were less libidinous.<br>
Any number of things might cause it.  Just because the particular measure<br>
of "wealth" used in the initial study is a modern phenomenon doesn't mean<br>
that there isn't some more fundamental variable not postulated that<br>
correlates well with modern wealth.<br>
<p>
"Language of DNA" is not the right way to treat "genes", because it leads<br>
to the wrong conclusions.  The fact that what we call a "gene", i.e.,<br>
the inheritable whatever-it-is that results in some trait, is implemented<br>
in DNA is no reason to limit its effects to the proximal effects of<br>
DNA protein synthesis.  Yes, DNA is a language for doing one thing;<br>
but since the effects 100 steps further along in the chain of causality<br>
can still materially differ when the DNA differs, and the /difference/<br>
causes selection, it makes perfect sense to say that this 100-levels-<br>
removed-from-DNA phenomenon is selected genetically, because it carries<br>
that chunk of DNA into the next generation regardless of whether it<br>
"coded" for the trait or not.<br>
<p>
Evolution is not a forward-looking plan; it is a backward-looking <br>
effect.  DNA doesn't know or care what its "purpose" is.  It just<br>
sits there obliviously copying itself and having whatever effect it<br>
has on the being's development and life.  Somewhere down the line,<br>
those organisms that developed from DNA that happened to have some<br>
long-range effect that made them less "fit" than organisms with some<br>
different DNA died off, or had fewer kids, and the fitter ones went<br>
on.  The precise chain of steps from DNA to behavior is irrelevant.<br>
If the behavior--or morphology, or external conditions, or any other<br>
feature affected by the organism--differs with different DNA, and it<br>
has some differential effect on fitness, then it is an inherited<br>
trait, regardless of whether it's the height of a beaver's dam, the<br>
odds of cheating on your wife, or the size of your bank account.<br>
<p>
Again, I'm not saying that there /is/ a genetic basis.  I agree that it<br>
is probably less likely than a cultural one.  I only point out that the<br>
idea of a genetic basis is much less far-fetched than in might sound.<br>
