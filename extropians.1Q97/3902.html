Yes, cloning will certainly help us here (especially since surrogate parents <br>
are likely to jump at the chance of having a genius child).<br>
<p>
But I disagree with your first sentence. If you look at the lives of <br>
various geniuses, many of them were born in fairly ordinary <br>
circumstances. But then they started to differentiate themselves and made <br>
their own circumstances fit them. This process seems to be linked with <br>
the ability to concentrate and motivate oneself rather than the specifics <br>
of the environment. However, the right sources of knowledge and education <br>
has to be present for full growth of the genius (cf. Ramanujan). There <br>
might be some genetic component that gives potential geniuses their <br>
powers of concentration/near obsession, but to become a real genius you <br>
need more than that.<br>
<p>
I have this feeling that there are likely millions of potential geniuses<br>
out there who never did develop their full potential due to lack of<br>
support. <br>
