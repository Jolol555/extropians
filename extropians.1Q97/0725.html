After doing additional research, I may have to modify my above stated<br>
figures a little bit.  The 500-1000 meter range for a 1-Mt lunar surface<br>
burst was extrapolated from nuclear data for surface bursts on earth<br>
(obviously, since there have never been lunar nuclear tests).  The problem<br>
is that it was difficult to remove atmospheric related cratering effects<br>
from blast and ground shock related effects, since my engineering books<br>
always assume that the blast occurs on earth.<br>
<p>
It occurred to me that studying *underground* nuclear tests, I could get<br>
information on nuclear explosions in an environment where atmospheric<br>
factors are not involved.  Unfortunately, nobody publishes underground<br>
nuclear test data.  What I was able to do, however, was get information on<br>
yield and crater dimensions after the underground chamber collapsed for a<br>
couple underground tests.  There are standard civil engineering equations<br>
that allowed me to reconstruct the underground blast damage effects based on<br>
crater dimension and shape.  Based on this data, I constructed a new set of<br>
data for lunar explosions based on underground nuclear tests.  I think this<br>
data may be more accurate, since it only reflects ground shock related damage.<br>
<p>
I based my results on a 10-Mt lunar surface burst, since this seems to be<br>
the "standard" baseline for argumentative purposes.<br>
<p>
For a lunar 10-Mt yield, distance from ground zero:<br>
<p>
0-500 meters    :you are screwed<br>
500-800 meters  :hardened shelter required<br>
<i>&gt;800 meters     :standard lunar structure should survive</i><br>
<p>
<p>
These figures assume that underground nuclear tests are reasonably accurate<br>
models for calculation of lunar nuclear effects.<br>
