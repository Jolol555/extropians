                     <br>
<p>
There is no evidence that Lucy did any hunting at all, even with much later <br>
and much more intelligent species like Africanus and Habilis the evidence <br>
is mixed. They certainly ate meat when they could, but what we find is very  <br>
heavy limb bones broken open by hominids to get at the marrow, we also find <br>
teeth marks from cats and other predators on these bones. According to Donald<br>
Johanson, the man who found Lucy, predators, even hyenas, have great trouble <br>
breaking open these heavy leg bones from large animals. He thinks that after <br>
the big cats made a kill and ate all they could, and even the hyenas were no <br>
longer interested, these early hominids helped themselves with the garbage. <br>
The image of "Man The Mighty Scavenger" is not very sexy but it may be true.<br>

<i>        &gt;been one major factor in the evolution of the human line.                      </i><br>
             <br>
I agree, isolation always encourages the development of new species.<br>

<i>        &gt;(late) afarensis was a tool user. </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Early or late, I've never seen any evidence that Afarensis (Lucy) made tools. <br>
Habilis made crude tools, so did Africanus and Robustus, Erectus made some <br>
pretty sophisticated highly crafted tools, but Lucy made nothing at all. <br>
What I want to know is if she wasn't making tools why did she bother to <br>
become bipedal and what did she use that first rate hand for?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If YOU believe in evolution, you have to acknowledge that even         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;though the improvements to these cats, are nowhere near the ones         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that appeared in Hominids, there  will have been improvements. </i><br>
                                   <br>
<p>
Although I wouldn't go as far as Stephen Jay Gould and say that Evolution has <br>
nothing to do with improvement only adaptation, it would be very misleading <br>
to look on it as a straight ladder leading to perfection. Ancient cats were <br>
adapted to their environment, modern cats are adapted to theirs, besides <br>
3.9 millions years is usually too short a time to change things very <br>
dramatically, the Hominid line a very important exception.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Did any of my posting about the chimps being able to handle the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;leopards get trough to you ? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm sure they can handle a dummy leopard, perhaps on rare occasions a real  <br>
one too, but I don't think on average leopards have much to fear from chimps, <br>
rather the reverse.              <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Look up a picture of a smilodon skull - It's FLAT where the brain         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;should be, where todays big cats have much rounder skulls. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A rounder skull does not prove a bigger brain. Neanderthal's had a very low <br>
forehead because their skull was much flatter and longer than ours, yet their  <br>
brain was as large as ours, perhaps slightly larger.<br>
