[hi Extropians, this is for another list, I thought you'd enjoy it]<br>
<p>
Jeff Lister--<br>
: &gt;: If economic considerations are the *only* consideration, then you<br>
: &gt;: truely do have a beast; it [the market?] will evolve blindly and<br>
: &gt;: inexorably toward its stable niche (and this is the important<br>
: &gt;: part-&gt;) independant of the cares or wishes of those working within it.<br>
<p>
Anton Sherwood--<br>
: &gt;That's a bit like saying the gravity field of a galaxy as a whole<br>
: &gt;is independent of the gravity fields of its component stars.<br>
<p>
Jeff Lister--<br>
: Good point, but i'm not sure the analogy applies.<br>
<p>
Here's a better one.  Consider a binary star, two stars bound by gravity.<br>
In the plane of their mutual orbit, and rotating with them, J.L.Lagrange<br>
(1772) identified five points where the balance of forces is such that a<br>
small mass can stay put.  Three of these points, on the line through the<br>
stars, are unstable: if the satellite is nudged along the line it will<br>
accelerate away from the Lagrange point.  But two (L4 and L5), each<br>
forming an equilateral triangle with the stars, are attractors --<br>
virtual masses (though their gravity fields are far from symmetrical).<br>
Satellites can orbit these points.  The attractors are informally<br>
called trojan points, because most of the asteroids around the<br>
Sun-Jupiter triangle points happen to be named from the Iliad.<br>
(Trojan companions have also been found for Saturn's big moons.)<br>
<p>
You seem to be suggesting that the market obeys not only the wishes of<br>
human buyers/sellers (the true masses) but also fluke phenomena, phantom<br>
bidders, analogous to the trojan points.  I thank you for planting that<br>
interesting thought.  But because the market is far more complex and<br>
chaotic than a two-body system, I expect the "market trojan points"<br>
to be transitory.<br>
