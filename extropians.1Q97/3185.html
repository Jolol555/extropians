I said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;1. Unlike conventional infectious diseases, including venereal diseases,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;American/European AIDS is nonrandomly (90%) restricted to males, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;although no AIDS disease is male specific.</i><br>
<p>
Steve Edwards, former virologist, said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The list above contains some inaccuracies--</i><br>
<i>&gt;1)  AIDs is not at all male specific.  The over abundance of male cases in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the U.S. is entirely due to....[snip]</i><br>
<p>
If I'm being inaccurate in saying that males make up roughly 90% of<br>
American and European AIDS cases, why do you feel it necessary to<br>
explain the "over abundance of male cases"? Isn't that self-contradictory?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the statements that you make following that, I assume that you accept </i><br>
the statement that for over a decade roughly 9 out of 10 American AIDS<br>
patients have been male, and that you explain this by arguing:<br>
<p>
(a)&gt;The over abundance of male cases in the U.S. is entirely due to its route <br>
<i>   &gt;of entry onto American soil via a homosexual community that was </i><br>
<i>   &gt;incredibly promiscuous</i><br>
<p>
and that:<br>
<p>
(b)&gt;New cases of HIV infection not attributable to needles show a <br>
<i>   &gt;female dominant pattern</i><br>
<p>
But I don't understand your statement that<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Aids is not at all male specific</i><br>
<p>
in light of your very next sentence which seeks to explain WHY males make<br>
up an "over abundance of AIDS cases in the US".  <br>
<p>
Anyway, in regard to point (a) I would point out that viral AIDS should have <br>
long since entered into the general population just like all authentic infectious <br>
diseases, even if its point of entry 15 years ago was an incredibly promiscuous<br>
gay flight attendant, as, I believe, the book The Band Played On speculates.<br>
According to the hypothesis that AIDS is a sexually transmitted viral disease,<br>
AIDS should have long equilibrated between the sexes-exactly as predicted by<br>
AIDS establishment. The failure to leave specific risk groups in more than a<br>
decade poses serious challenges to the virus hypothesis.<br>
<p>
Additionally, your argument that AIDS has been restricted to males <br>
because the virus first got its foothold in the US in male homosexuals <br>
and has remained with homosexuals until recently is inconsistent <br>
with the following:<br>
<p>
The U.S. Army [Burke, D.S., J.F. Brundage, M. Goldensaum,<br>
M. Gardner, M. Peterson, R. Visintine, R. Redfield, and the<br>
Walter Reed Retrovirus Research Group. Human immunodeficiency<br>
virus infections in teenagers; seroprevalence among applicants for<br>
the US military service. J.Am.Med.Ass. 263 (1990):2074-2077]<br>
and the US Job Corps [St. Louis, M.E., G.A. Conway, C.R. Hayman,<br>
C. Miller, L.R. Peterson, and T.J. Dondero. Human immunodefiency<br>
virus infection in disadvantaged adolescents. J.Am.Med.Ass. 266<br>
(1991): 2387-2391] report, based upon millions of tests, that HIV<br>
has been equally distributed between the sexes among 17 to 21<br>
year olds of the general population. <br>
<p>
This data predicts that among 17 to 24 year olds, AIDS risks should<br>
be distributed equally between the sexes.  However the CDC documents<br>
that 85% of the AIDS cases among 17 to 24 year olds were males<br>
(CDC, 1992). <br>
<p>
HIV seems equally distributed between the sexes, yet males make up<br>
almost 9 out of 10 AIDS cases. Paradoxical to the theory that HIV<br>
causes AIDS.<br>
<p>
As for (b) the recent increase in AIDS cases among non IV drug using <br>
women, in 1993 the CDC changed the definition of AIDS to include<br>
cervical cancer in the list of indicator diseases.  This was the first<br>
gender specific AIDS disease and it had the predictable result of<br>
increasing the number of non IV drug-using women AIDS patients,<br>
although they make up a very small % of total AIDS cases.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2)  There is something strange about the latency period.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  The basis for the 10 year latent period of the virus, which <br>
has a generation time of only 24 to 48 hours, is entirely unknown.  <br>
There is no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary <br>
diseases on average only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only <br>
after 2 years in children.  The diversity of these latent periods is <br>
inconsistent with one infectious agent and their magnitude is <br>
characteristic for diseases caused by chronic exposure to toxic substances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nevertheless, the vast majority of HIV positive people eventually </i><br>
<i>&gt;die of opportunistic infection, a fact that needs explaining.  </i><br>
<p>
About 38% of all AIDS diseases, i.e. dementia, wasting disease,<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma are neither caused by, nor necessarily<br>
associated with, immunodeficiency [World Health Organization, 1992;<br>
and CDC, 1992]. In these AIDS indicator diseases that<br>
are not caused by immunodeficiency, HIV is not even present in the<br>
diseased tissues, e.g., there is no trace of HIV in any Kaposi's sarcomas<br>
[Salahuddin, S.K., S. Naecamura, P. Biberfeld, M.K. Kaplan, P.D.<br>
Markham, L. Larsson, and R.C. Gallo.  Angiogenic properties of<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cells after long-term culture in vitro. Science<br>
242 (1988): 430-433] and there is no HIV in neurons of patients with <br>
dementia, because of the generic inability of retroviruses to infect <br>
nondividing cells like neurons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;people eventually die ...a fact that needs explaining.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From its recognition in 1981, AIDS has been restricted in Europe and</i><br>
America to patients from abnormal risk groups whose health had been<br>
severely compromised prior to the onset of symptoms. About 60% of<br>
AIDS patients in America are male homosexuals who have abused<br>
psychoactive and aphrodisiac drugs (including nitrate inhalants),<br>
about 33% are IV drug users and their children, 2% are transfusion<br>
recipients, and 1% are hemophiliacs.  Only about 3% of American<br>
AIDS patients are from "undetermined exposure categories". (CDC 1992)<br>
<p>
It is argued that health risks associated with these groups, and not HIV,<br>
is causing AIDS.  <br>
<p>
HIV is correlated with AIDS because IV drug users who share needles, <br>
for example, are collecting viruses the way some people collect stamps.<br>
The higher the consumption of unsterile drugs, the more accidentally<br>
contaminating microbes will be accumulated. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3)  HIV, by itself, is not what kills you.  It only destroys your immune</i><br>
<i>&gt;system.  Hence it is not odd that different risk groups should have</i><br>
<i>&gt;different symptoms.</i><br>
<p>
The existence of risk-group-specific AIDS-defining diseases in the absence <br>
of HIV challenges your assertion. Controlled studies indicate that the <br>
incidence of AIDS-defining diseases in IV drug users and in male <br>
homosexuals engaging in high-risk behavior and hemophiliacs <br>
is independent of HIV. Each health risk group has nonviral health risks<br>
that are necessary and sufficient causes of AIDS <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The AIDs infrastructure has at time been alarmist and overconfident of</i><br>
<i>&gt;research claims.  It wants money thrown at it. Nevertheless,</i><br>
<i>&gt;one should not throw out all the HIV/AIDs research </i><br>
<i>&gt;on that grounds.  </i><br>
<p>
I don't.  I reject the theory that HIV causes AIDS on the grounds<br>
that it violates so many established principles of virology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Duesberg can't be trusted... he's into publicity for it's own sake...</i><br>
<p>
"Peter Duesberg has fought with courage and tenacity to drag<br>
a reluctant scientific community back to AIDS sanity since<br>
detecting falsehoods in the HIV story more than a decade ago.<br>
His efforts have earned him much personal abuse, but may<br>
ultimately save countless lives"<br>
Neville Hodgkinson, editor, The London Sunday Times<br>
<p>
Dr. Peter Duesberg's courage and his book Inventing the AIDS<br>
Virus will save millions of lives.  He is not only one of the few<br>
people in the world qualified enough to see through the scientific<br>
'AIDS scam', but he is the only one who has sacrificed his<br>
career to save the world from it."<br>
Tony Brown, host of PBS's "Tony Brown's Journal"<br>
<p>
Both these observers note the price that questioning the accepted<br>
wisdom has taken on Duesbergs' career.  From having his<br>
Outstanding Investigator Grant from the NIH canceled, to being<br>
censored by the editor of Nature (John Maddox), and being insulted<br>
("It's the virus, stupid" from Ho, current Time Magazine 'Man of the<br>
Year'), Duesberg could have certainly chosen an easier path to<br>
publicity.  I think he is a bit of a modern-day Galileo in that regard.<br>
