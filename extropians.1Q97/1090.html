<i>&gt; Karl Popper and William Bartley</i><br>
<i>&gt; have done an excellent job explaining what rationality is as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; as what distinguishes it from competing traditions, but for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time being "reason" has no more of a precise referent than does</i><br>
<i>&gt; "God" or "emotion".</i><br>
<p>
It has no /specific/ referent, as it is defined above, in terms<br>
of knowledge and reality, but it is testable, and therefore real.<br>
If a specific method under question produces knowledge inconsistent<br>
with our conscious experience of reality, to the limits of our<br>
ability to measure it, then it isn't reason.  In judging methods,<br>
consistency is required, completeness not.  I.e., any method that<br>
produces false knowledge even once is out, but a method capable<br>
of producing knowledge that fails to explain everything is still<br>
open to debate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The point I am trying to make is that given the current state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognitive science, the word "reason" might very well turn out to be as</i><br>
<i>&gt; free of content as "caloric" or "phlogiston".</i><br>
<p>
Are those words truly free of content?  In the context in which they<br>
were created, they referred to observable phenomena.  They happened to<br>
lead to wrong conclusions about those phenomena, so we abandoned them,<br>
but they were meaningful, if wrong.  I think what you may be trying to<br>
say is that there is no reason to suspect that my ostensive experience<br>
of "knowledge" and "reality" are in fact "Truth" in some metaphysical,<br>
final, perfect sense.  I agree.  I do not have any faith that the things<br>
I call knowledge and reality are anything but my experience of them, but<br>
nor am I explicitly skeptical that they are not.  But they /are/ all I<br>
have to work with.  I am not God.  Or maybe I am.  But I experience that<br>
I know things, and I experience that there are things to know, and I<br>
find no reason to deny those experiences, or to act in a way that is<br>
inconsistent with them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Reason is a culturally-evolved component of our total cognitive toolkit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I happen to value it highly, and like you, I find my chief grounds for</i><br>
<i>&gt; disappointment with my fellow human beings in their reluctance to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; and develop their reason. But I don't think that making an idol of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reason is going to solve anyone's problems. And I certainly don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that using this idol to verbally drub other people about the head and</i><br>
<i>&gt; shoulders is going to increase the quality of information flowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; through this list, which is *my* selfish interest in the matter.</i><br>
<p>
That begs the question of how you evaluate the "quality" of the<br>
information, doesn't it?  Do you want it to be more entertaining, or<br>
more voluminous, or more enlightening?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now you are making it clear that the value you place on Reason is</i><br>
<i>&gt; grounded in your own knowledge. Perhaps now it will be easier for</i><br>
<i>&gt; you to understand that the value others place on "balance" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "feeling" is grounded in knowledge and experience of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they can no more produce for you on demand than you can produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; an accurate, precise, and denotative definition of "reason".</i><br>
<p>
In one sense, I agree: I have no way to experience what you experience<br>
directly, so I cannot prove that you don't have knowledge of Truth<br>
that I don't have.  So when someone describes an idea that, to me,<br>
contradicts my experience, I have three choices. (1) there is no shared<br>
reality, (2) I am mistaken, (3) he is mistaken.  So far, I have found<br>
no reason to suspect (1) yet (when I throw a ball, someone else catches<br>
a ball, so shared reality works), and I have found no other method to<br>
distinguish between (2) and (3) that works better than the methods I<br>
currently employ, and which seem to piss a lot of people off when I<br>
conclude (3).  Well, that's life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My ulterior motive in accusing you of ranting against passion was to</i><br>
<i>&gt; strike a nerve, because I've been annoyed by your repeated insistence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that words cannot hurt people. This is an attitude that I would *expect*</i><br>
<i>&gt; to find only among those who are accustomed to using physical force to</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurt people.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting.  Hate to blow your theory, but I've never thrown a punch<br>
in my life, never owned a gun, and am utterly repulsed by violence.  I<br>
suppose that might be one reason why I like to move combat to the realm<br>
of ideas instead.  And to clarify what I thought I calrified earlier,<br>
I admitted that "words hurt people" is objectively true.  What I fought<br>
is the idea of restraint for its own sake; the idea that a listener's<br>
emotional reaction to speech should, in itself, make that speech immoral.<br>
If the speech is false, and intended /only/ to evoke the reaction, then<br>
perhaps it is immoral.  But if the speech is true, and intended to help<br>
the speaker find more knowledge or gain some other value, then the fact<br>
of the listener's reactions should not in itself be cause for restraint.<br>
In fact I think it is cause to improve the listener's cognitive apparatus<br>
with the addition of some tolerance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I'm also quite curious as to what you mean to refer to by the phrase</i><br>
<i>&gt; "mental energy", but this would probably be muddying the issue.)</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, that was a needless rhetorical flourish.  I meant nothing more<br>
than time spent thinking.<br>
