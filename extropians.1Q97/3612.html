I shouldn't do this, but....<br>

This is original from me. It was originally an answer I wrote for the<br>
Internet Oracle - I've reworked it as a standalone.<br>

<p>
To    Microsoft Lawyers, Inc.<br>
<i>&gt;From  Azathoth, Nyarlathotep and Hastur, Elder Attorneys.</i><br>
<p>
Sirs:<br>
<p>
Our agents among the mortal herd have brought to Our attention<br>
your recent product entitled Windows '95. Therefore We now give<br>
you statutory notice of intent of proceedings to be taken against <br>
Microsoft by the Many-Angled Ones.<br>
<p>
With this suit We will show that Windows '95, and to a lesser<br>
extent all of the Microsoft range of products, infringe upon the <br>
recognised "look-and-feel" of the Elder Gods, for the following <br>
reasons:<br>
<p>
o   Windows '95 is a crawling abomination from the darkest<br>
pits of Hell;<br>
<p>
o   No man can be in its presence for too long without being<br>
driven into gibbering insanity;<br>
<p>
o   A cult who worship it exist in secret amongst the mortal<br>
herd;<br>
<p>
o   Those who associate with it for too long develop common<br>
physical characteristics, to wit: pale, clammy skin, bulging<br>
eyes, generally unkempt physical appearance, tendency<br>
towards nocturnal living, change in diet to that which normal<br>
men do not eat (in your case tacos, burgers and Jolt Coke;<br>
in Ours, human flesh, Fungi of Yuggoth and the blood of Alien<br>
Gods);<br>
<p>
o   Mysterious tomes that purport to explain this phenomenon are<br>
reputed to exist; they are bound in an unnatural substance<br>
and only available at a terrible cost to the user. <br>
<p>
o   The Microsoft range of products seek to utterly dominate<br>
the world, and force all who dwell there to live in eternal<br>
damnation.<br>
<p>
As you can see, Our case is very strong, especially when<br>
you consider that most judges prefer not to have chittering<br>
things with tentacles for faces scoop out their brains and<br>
eat them.<br>
<p>
We hope that you will consider these points carefully and settle<br>
out of court, since it is not Our intention to have your senior <br>
partners spend the rest of their mercifully short lives under<br>
heavy sedation in a maximum security psychiatric hospital. After <br>
all, it was the Lords of the Outer Planes who gave humanity<br>
lawyers in the first place.<br>
<p>
Respectfully yours,<br>
<p>
&lt;Oddly disturbing squiggle in some sort of ichor&gt;<br>
<p>
pp. J. Arthur Hastur, LL.B., B.C.L, B.D<br>
