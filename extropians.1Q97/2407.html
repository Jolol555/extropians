[Max M. Rasmussen:]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;BTW i dont think that the spaceprogram is very important right now. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;really ought to wait some decades before the technolgy is more refined.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There's a huge conscience-implosion going on right now with most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;world focusing on the internet, multimedia, comunication, simulators, cad</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;etc. All of wich will probably lead to some kind of singularity. So</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sometimes later we probably can fly to space in small private spacecrafts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;powerered with Drexler-like diamond engines. why not wait and let the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;explosion happen then?</i><br>
<p>
[E. Shaun Russell:]<br>
<i>&gt;         Because it might not happen.  Although I agree with your post in</i><br>
<i>&gt; spirit, it still has tones of singularity-based reliance (which in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinion is of the same calibre as a deus-based reliance.)  While I agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there *is* a huge world-focus upon computers and global-village</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication, I still think that there should be attempts at maximizing our</i><br>
<i>&gt; [society's] current potential in all the other areas...including space</i><br>
<i>&gt; travel.  Nothing beats a sure thing, and the only way to make things sure is</i><br>
<i>&gt; to *kineticize* and maximize their potential.</i><br>
<p>
Speaking as someone who thinks that the Singularity is unknowable and<br>
extrapolating beyond it is silly, let me also say that I explicitly<br>
agree with E. Shaun on this one - simply on practical grounds.  Our<br>
attempts at space travel, however futile in direct terms, did a HELL of<br>
a lot to advance the Singularity.  At a guess, by a decade at least. <br>
None of that would have happened if we'd waited for the Singularity to<br>
save us.<br>
<p>
I speculated in my Singularity site about how Powers might solve math<br>
problems, for the simple reason that the speculation might prove<br>
necessary for building first-stage AIs.  Any science may by pure<br>
serendipity advance the Singularity, even if - or especially if - it is<br>
directed at goals so astronomical as to practically require a<br>
Singularity to power it.<br>
<p>
(Also, I don't believe the ends justify the means.  Strictly from a<br>
pragmatic viewpoint, humans aren't built to be pragmatists.  When we<br>
try, things go wrong, others stop trusting us, and we get our souls all<br>
icky.  So don't rely on the Singularity for moral justification.)<br>
