In a message dated 97-01-04 15:49:38 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Being a visual person I have always seen pictures when I listen to music,<br>
 abstract images moving and changing according to the flow (Scriabin is a<br>
 golden glow, Jarre's "Revolution" as a mushroom shape in a neon swamp, the<br>
 chorus of Beethoven's ninth symphony as a scaly golden fractal dragon<br>
 coiling in a great helix); this seems to be somewhat akin to synesthesia,<br>
 but not exactly the real thing. <br>

Interesting stuff, Anders, and thank you for your fascinating and detailed<br>
reply. As a visual and musical artist who's Ai obsession grows daily,  wonder<br>
about these things a lot and how it will actually be that "uploaded"<br>
consciousness will approximate such sensory stimulus and music, smell etc. <br>
I seek to understand in order to build theses worlds when the time comes.<br>
<p>
<p>
The most interesting part of all this is this link between the senses and,<br>
not understanding the brain as i could ( and asa I will, someday) i tend to<br>
make intiutive ( and probably wrong) leaps. But this visual/aural link is so<br>
common (Mozart looks like meticulous mosaics, bach like architecture etc) _<br>
that it seems to me MUST be  linked to patern recognition in cognition. Have<br>
you ever heard of any A.I. experiments being done with learning pattern<br>
recognition based on musical notation, linking it tosound waves and harmony (<br>
meaning)? Any computers working overtime to develope that kind of pattern<br>
reconition ( aural - or wave based?)<br>
<p>
Some how these areas seem key.<br>
