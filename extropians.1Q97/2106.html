   Apparently, my associate, Lloyd Miller of A-albionic Research, has run accross _Virus of the Mind_:<br>

Subject: 	Memes and Conspiracy<br>
<p>
	I have been reading your book, Virus of the Mind, and was pleased<br>
to see your section "conspiracy theories".  Now, my associate James<br>
Daugherty tells me you are on the Extropian list.  Both James and I are<br>
quite impressed with the Extropians.<br>
<p>
	Many years ago before I had even heard of memes I came up with the<br>
idea that "Conspiracy theory is a heurism for social organism theory",<br>
meaning that most "conspiracies" are really "macrobes" or "social<br>
organisms" controlled and unified by what I then called "idea cement".<br>
Yah, I know, I invented the word "heurism" to mean a learning device, in<br>
this case, leading to social organism theory.  Anyway, what I was getting<br>
at is a way of explaining how most members of a "conspiracy" are<br>
unconscious of the overall goals of their social organism yet act in a<br>
co-ordinated fashion to achieve the goals of the organism.<br>
<p>
	Perhaps I should finish reading your book before I say this, but,<br>
in my opinion, memeticians are failing to take seriously that memes are to<br>
social organisms or macrobes as genes are to biological organisms.<br>
Ultimately, memes survive because they impart characteristics to their<br>
macrobe that enhance survival of the macrobe just as genes impart survival<br>
characteristics to biological organisms.  Memeticians seem to fall into<br>
the view that memes compete directly with each other....like a catchy<br>
virus.  Yup, we probably have a big disagreement on this one, judging from<br>
the title of your book.<br>
<p>
	As an aside, I see no reason why especially well developed<br>
macrobes might not be "conscious" in the same way that well developed<br>
biological organisms seem to be "conscious".  Note that in both cases<br>
consciousness would be independent of any cell or individual, a not well<br>
understood property of a complex organism.<br>
<p>
	Another aside:  The focus on the possibility a "one world" macrobe, Gaia,<br>
has diverted attention from the much better developed power organism more<br>
available for study:  The major world religions, power establishments,<br>
etc.<br>
