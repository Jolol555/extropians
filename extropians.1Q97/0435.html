I was thinking recently (oh wow! big suprise!) and the idea came to me that<br>
when we take the first extraterrestrial life forms and place them on earth<br>
won't they scare the shit out of existing animals because they're evolution<br>
is so entirely different. Perhaps they'll scare the shit outta us by<br>
appearing horribly disfigured by our standards. Evolution took a specific<br>
course on Earth and therefore all animals have somewhat specific traits<br>
which allow us to identify things such as eyes and noses. If they have all<br>
their senses in different locations or entirely different senses what will<br>
we think.<br>
<p>
Someone on this mailinglist once told me that the human brain can<br>
potentially hold 5-7 petabytes of information (1 petabyte=100 terabytes).<br>
Why so much? How did we evolve such storage capacity? Has anyone in the<br>
history of the human race ever breached the limit?<br>
<p>
Another thing I'm beginning to find is that I continue to come upon Ralph<br>
Merkle's name constantly in all these publications. (This month's wired in<br>
"Evolution Revolution", Neil Stephenson's Diamond Age where there is a<br>
structure called "Merkle Hall", and multiple references to him in those<br>
USAF 2025 archives to name a few). Seems he's turning into quite a nanotech<br>
celebrity, glad to have him here. Where is he anyways? I haven't seen him<br>
around for awhile.<br>
