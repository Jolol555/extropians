How would you like to be chairwoman of a committee?  Sexist words I don't <br>

Hofstadter's essays (plus I've always used the indefinite 'they'), until<br>
I ran into some Usenet discussion including someone getting very upset<br>
over non-sexist or reverse-sexist language.  Not saying it didn't<br>
matter; getting upset.  I agree that it shouldn't matter, which is why I<br>
now try to use feminine pronouns where masculine ones would be used<br>
instead, out of spite.<br>

<p>
Hrrm.  Maybe, if everyone was taught sign language.  I hadn't thought <br>
of that.<br>
<p>
On to my post.<br>
<p>
First case: the "silent 'e'" isn't.  Most of you should know this<br>
already, but I'll go through it anyway.  Although final 'e's aren't<br>
pronounced as such they do lengthen preceding vowels, a rather necessary<br>
task as we have 5 vowel symbols and 13 simple vowel sounds, although<br>
that includes the schwa which is sort of defined as the vowel English<br>
doesn't care about.  Still, even the long/short dichotomy taught in<br>
grammar school (inadequate -- can you come up with 3 values for 'a'?<br>
But then they still impose Latin syntax on our language.) (how about<br>
discussing punctuation and parentheses?) gives ten sounds which our<br>
alphabet doesn't include.  ton/tone, run/rune.  'done' might seem an<br>
exception, with the save value as 'ton', but then try prouncing 'don'.<br>
The vowel is still lengthened.  Of course I would prounce 'con' like<br>
'don' but 'cone' like 'tone' -- the vowel is _still_ lengthened, but<br>
inconsistently somewhere.<br>
<p>
Second case: some dialects drop 'r' or 'h' in many places.  Should their<br>
writing conform to their pronunciation?  I think most would agree that<br>
that would confuse them and us.  The problem isn't that orthography<br>
doesn't match phonology but that phonology doesn't match phonology --<br>
that's what it means to have dialects.  _Except_, that the differences<br>
between dialects often follow patterns -- consistent shifts of vowels,<br>
dropping terminal 'r', or whatnot.  Rather than having our writing<br>
pinned to one privileged/standard dialect (simple solution) we've<br>
evolved an orthography representing an abstract phonology from which an<br>
actual phonetic pronuniciation can be predicted using the rules of the<br>
dialect -- rules often similar in form to other dialects, but with<br>
different values.  Not that there still aren't irregularities, but part<br>
of English's complexity is in fact solving a problem most people don't<br>
realize exists.  A rather 'fair' solution, too.<br>
<p>
And then much of the remaining irregularity is not random, but encodes<br>
historial information, which may well be subject to more rules.  Our<br>
French, Greek, and Italian imports are the biggies here.  'philosopher'<br>
could be 'filosofer', but that would lose the handy etymological crutch<br>
-- particularly considering how much of English's classical<br>
constructions get adopted by other languages, e.g. I think the Japanese<br>
and Russian words for a telephone is more or less 'telephone'.  And<br>
conversely, knowing that 'philosopher' is Greek in origin helps <br>
transcribe the /f/ sound properly.  Similarly, one could gripe about<br>
having to memorize the odd spelling of /shato/ (actually, I want to<br>
pronounce that with a long /a/, whoops) 'chateau', and ask for it to be<br>
spelled 'shato', or one could remember that French /sh/ is 'ch', /o/ is<br>
'eau', and that the word is French, thus spelling it with ease, except<br>
for the terminal 'x' of 'Bordeaux' whose justification I am unfamiliar<br>
with.<br>
<p>
Again, there are still flaws, but most of what is considered an insanely<br>
flawed structure is in fact quite powerful and useful for dealing with a<br>
multi-dialect history-rich language.  Without a jot of intelligence<br>
having been applied to the overall design.  So much for the perils of<br>
anarchy.<br>
