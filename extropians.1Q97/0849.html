I wrote, "I want to excell at everything... my whole mind is becoming based on <br>
[the] ideas of excellence and continual improvement."<br>
<p>
And Tony Csoka asked, "do you feel that you derive enough happiness from life <br>
by pursuing only these goals?"<br>
<p>
Only these goals?  *ONLY* these goals?!  I don't see what's so *only* about <br>
*everything*.  I don't think you quite understand how *diverse* my goals and <br>
my activities actually are.  Let me just say that I plan to become among the <br>
best of the best in a large number of different fields.  I'm certainly not <br>
going to neglect anything that will increase my happiness to levels far beyond <br>
what the typical human ever dreams of.  My own personal happiness is my only <br>
real concern, and I am becoming quite expert at achieving it at higher and <br>
higher levels.  I think learning to excell at everything will be *a lot* of <br>
fun and will bring me much happiness.<br>
<p>
More realistically, Mr. Csoka goes on to ask, "You mentioned that you felt <br>
that your family had as much importance as the bushes outside. What do you <br>
think about the concept of the family itself, and how does it fit into <br>
extropian thinking? On what level of importance do you rank love and <br>
friendship in your envisioned future?"<br>
<p>
Well, that was about four years ago, when my family lost all meaning to me.  <br>
Since then, I have come to know my siblings and my parents much better as <br>
individuals, and I love them all very much.  I think the concept of family is <br>
wonderful; however I don't define 'family' in the traditional way, of having <br>
the same immediate ancestors.  To me, a family is a group of individuals, <br>
working together in mutually supportive relationships to achieve their <br>
individual and common goals.  I think these types of relationships are <br>
extrememly important for people to be in, if they are to excell in their <br>
lives.  Love and friendship are tremendously important to me, and I imagine <br>
that they will become even more important as I continue my development.  I <br>
believe that excellence will be much easier to attain if I am working on it <br>
along with others who are all helping each other to learn and grow.<br>

joy in each other's life.  Rarely do members of one family grow up under the <br>
same roof."  - Richard Bach, _Illusions_<br>
