It's not obvious to me.  There are lots of small elections that don't<br>
cost that much to enter.  Maybe you'd need an expensive ad campaign to<br>
make clear your position the first time someone like this ran, but<br>
after the first few all you need to say is "random party", and<br>
everyone should know exactly what you mean.  No need for finer policy<br>
statements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given the frequency with which candidates break promises ("Read my</i><br>
<i>&gt;lips ...", "I won't seek a second term", etc.), why would voters</i><br>
<i>&gt;expect they could enforce a promise of randomness?</i><br>
<p>
How about posting a bond that you lose if you break your promise?<br>
Compared to most political promises, this should be relatively easy to<br>
verify that it was broken.<br>
<p>
I do think it is possible that overcoming these two barriers is a cost<br>
that it happens that no group has been willing to try yet, and recent<br>
changes of opinion will soon make it feasible to overcome.  That is,<br>
it could be that this idea is just now ripe for implementation.  But<br>
we should consider other theories as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;can't be as skeptical as you regarding the information value of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;advertizing, or they wouldn't be persuaded by it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The rational agents in their minds could be aware that the information</i><br>
<i>&gt;value is negligible, but unable to prevent the advertisers from</i><br>
<i>&gt;exploiting evolutionary quirks in other parts of the mind.</i><br>
<p>
This is possible, but they why should these rational parts have any<br>
more luck convincing their bodies to endorse a random legislature,<br>
etc?  In general, I think it is too easy to make up irrationality<br>
theories; a equally simple rationality theory gets more weight for me.<br>
And there are such theories for advertizing. <br>
