Although many thought Johnny Carwash's post an insult to transhumans,<br>
normally I would ignore this type of scoff. However, out of respect to other<br>
list members, I'll respond to the post. Being "trendy" is not my style, nor<br>
do I honestly think it is a pastime of transhumans on this list. I set<br>
trends, I don't follow them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;First of all, the idea of a human or</i><br>
<i>&gt;posthuman or transhuman or anyotherprefixhuman with silicon skin isn't even</i><br>
<i>&gt;a concept out of science fiction, it's a concept out of stupid people trying</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be trendy.</i><br>
<p>
I'm amiss here.  I was referring to a bathing suit skin structure. Silicon<br>
has various elements, according to my references. Because silicon dioxide,<br>
or silica, has a low thermal coefficient of expansion, it is used in objects<br>
subjected to wide ranges of heat and cold. And also, any of a group of<br>
"semi-inorganic polymers based on the structural unit R2SiO, where R is an<br>
organic group, characterized by wide-range thermal stability, high<br>
lubricity, extreme water repellence, and physiological inertness and used in<br>
adhesives, lubricants, protective coatings, paints, electrical insulation,<br>
synthetic rubber, and prosthetic replacements for bodily parts."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The crystals of pure silicon (Si) used as semiconductor chips</i><br>
<i>&gt;are used for the semiconductor properties of silicon. In addition, silicon's</i><br>
<i>&gt;crystaline lattice structure is very rigid (another reason it's used for</i><br>
<i>&gt;chips .. </i><br>
<p>
You do have a point here, and one to consider from the perspective you<br>
offer.  However, it is limited in scope. Perhaps I could have spent more<br>
time in my post emphasizing what skin textures I will be presenting, but<br>
that was *not* the intent of the post, clearly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;(Note:  these images will in no way be gender biased.  In fact, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;pre-production are men, and other genders.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think that the images are kingdom biased! What about plants? eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Paramecium have a right to exist!! Don't they? .. speciesist ...</i><br>
<p>
This manner is childish and silly. How can any comment you make be taken<br>
earnestly when you lash out in what reads to be emotional wrath? It doesn't<br>
establish a sympathetic view of you.<br>
