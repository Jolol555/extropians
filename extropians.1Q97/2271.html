There is a current Transhumans thread about nerve growth factors <br>
(which I don't have any info on).  But, I did notice a report in the <br>
25 January 1997 Science News about a novel antioxidant that was <br>
reported in the 21 Jan Proceedings of the National Academy of <br>
Sciences.<br>
<p>
The antioxidant is a nitrone known as PBN which may slow aging in the <br>
brain.  While the purpose of most antioxidants is to scavenge <br>
destructive free radicals, the Science news article noted that some <br>
free radicals are necessary "to eliminate invaders and unwanted <br>
tissues [and] also to synthesize many important compounds, including <br>
hormones". Unlike most antioxidants, PBN (which is being developed by <br>
Centaur Pharmaceuticals) supposedly has the advantage that it does not <br>
eliminate these useful functions of free radicals, only their harmful <br>
effects.<br>
