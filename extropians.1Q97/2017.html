<i>&gt; &gt;adjust. If not then we should all feel shamed by this pending disaster.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We should all feel shamed? I think NOT!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mike could be a little smarter now about how he accesses the list. He</i><br>
could<br>
<i>&gt; unsubscribe, and then read the list from the WWW archive at</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.transhuman.org/exi/">http://www.transhuman.org/exi/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When Mike wants to post something, he could send it to Jim to post for</i><br>
him.<br>
<i>&gt; Direct, intelligent action works far better than prayer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Summoning invisible forces is not mutually exclusive but can give vital<br>
breathing time. Are you suggesting a mentor system? I'm all for it, but<br>
would do so by first activating under allowable Canadian law the legal<br>
lobby called Ekus UN-incorporated with both the virtual and local extropian<br>
directors. This organization is capable of handling Mike's problem under<br>
international law but needs on-the-ground backup to assist with the hard<br>
bits. I repeat that we should all feel shamed but some more than others.<br>
For example, I feel more responsibility than most for Mike's situation as<br>
it was me who probably had the last direct off-list contact immediately<br>
prior to the family 'reaction' and might have assessed the situation<br>
differently, had his age been known. With hindsight I realize the potential<br>
danger of a minor being coming into in possession of admittedly powerful<br>
information and regret the need to now share my off-list communications and<br>
its chain reaction. This doesn't hide the fact, as I can personally<br>
testify, that young or old many Transhumans are potentially subject to<br>
threatening discrimination from the mundanes, as Mike calls them, and have<br>
need of special diplomatic status. <br>
<p>
In reply to Mike's publicly published request for sovereign recognition, I<br>
sent information on the U.N. "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment<br>
of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, Including Diplomatic<br>
Agents." It is Mike perceived status more than 'Satanism' which is at the<br>
heart of Mike's parental insubordination and possible incarceration. I<br>
don't think Mike at whatever age is unbalanced simply considering this<br>
status. However coupled with a totalitarian parenting system it takes on an<br>
immediate social dimension and as a result, Mike is now in peril and his<br>
safety depends on ratifying his status and gaining the Convention's<br>
immunity from mental health laws. Let's face it even Gorbachev claims to<br>
have lunch with little green men and hasn't yet been chemically straight<br>
jacketed. This is, indeed, a very needed precedent for the Extropian cause.<br>
<p>
The information I sent Mike is reviewed below and as you will quickly agree<br>
it could well have given Mike the strength to rebel. One thing to note is,<br>
the computer like language used that is diplomatically both an OR and a NOT<br>
gate. I'll leave it to your imagination what to do, but suggest the Extropy<br>
Institute through a local contact find out more about Mike's progress<br>
assuming he is cut from his computer.<br>

mikec@jax.gulfnet.com (Mike Cowar.) quoted someone without attribution:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;I am protected under conventions for diplomatic agents.</i><br>

respect of any period, an internationally protected person.<br>

Stick those words into a search engine, say Infoseek, and find out. You'll<br>
be amazed. I could tell you but it would spoil the fun.<br>
