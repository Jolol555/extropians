In a message dated 2/24/97 9:13:59 PM, Robin Hanson explained that when he<br>
said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[The] biggest law would seem to have a lower monitoring/patroling cost,  </i><br>
<p>
he spoke<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;just about patroling, not all the other law functions.</i><br>
<p>
Point well taken.  Two points in response:<br>
<p>
1) Legal systems do much, much more than merely patrol.  They legislate and<br>
interpret and adjudicate and hector and . . . .  Moreover, very few Mafioso<br>
claim the right to patrol *all* aspects of behavior.  The Mafia, famously,<br>
co-exists with the Church.  Similarly, even if purely private legal systems<br>
enjoy such economies of scale that they can effectively control particular<br>
geographic areas, they will not necessarily quash legal diversity.  Examples<br>
from current US law illuminate the point; statists claim exclusive authority<br>
over the same behavior that concerns the Mafioso (and, note, do so rather<br>
ineffectually), yet purely private and customary legal systems thrive.  And,<br>
yes, these alternative systems do their own patrolling.  See, eg, any home<br>
owner's association.<br>
<p>
2) Why do we care so much who patrols, anyhow, so long as we enjoy diverse<br>
sources of law and freedom of exit?  If monopoly scares you, you won't like<br>
*any* aspect of the free market!  After all, my local 7-11 enjoys a natural<br>
monopoly (and we've been using natural monopoly arguments here, you know)<br>
over a several-block area, which will only support one such convenience<br>
store.  In other words, what you call "monopoly" relies crucially on how you<br>
define the relevant market.  <br>
<p>
For what it's worth, I expect a polycentric legal order would give rise to a<br>
mix of overlapping and exclusive legal systems.  The provision of criminal<br>
law (tort, really) may well get bundled with private communities, and thus<br>
apply uniformly to particular geographic locations.  Other types of laws (and<br>
enforcement mechanisms) will probably not (eg, commercial law, church law,<br>
etc.)<br>
<p>
