   I used to think I'd never live to see the day when things were really <br>
   weird enough for me. I no longer fret about not living to see that    <br>
   day. I think that day is coming plenty soon enough. (Bruce Sterling,<br>

Somewhere in _Schismatrix_ he says that the principal motor of change<br>
was "the fantastic capacity of the human mind for boredom".<br>
<p>
I sometimes wonder if this will be the principal challenge to long-term<br>
immortality. Suppose you have a Theory of Everything, with a secure<br>
epistemological foundation, and the Final Answers to Eliezer's hard<br>
problems (why anything exists, what is consciousness, perfect ethics).<br>
Would you now be doomed to boredom, short of a translobotomy reducing<br>
you to a pre-TOE state of uncertainty?<br>
<p>
One possibility is that "having a Theory of Everything" is an open-ended<br>
process, a bit like "having the axioms of set theory". Knowing that, at<br>
bottom, the universe is an aperiodic eleven-dimensional spin network, <br>
or whatever, might be a starting point for limitless further investigation, <br>
as well as the endpoint of basic ontological inquiry.<br>
<p>
Another possibility is that you will have to invent new things in order<br>
to remain interested. QueeneMUSE wrote, a while back,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that pattern recognition, in itself, is a pleasure reward,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, coupled with the ability of a supercomputer to crunch  things, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be *design* (a combination of the two)  that the SI's will spend most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their time on, not any form of physical pleasure we can imagine.</i><br>
<p>
Being bored with the phenomena of the pre-SI universe would be another<br>
way for an SI to arrive at a preoccupation with design.<br>
