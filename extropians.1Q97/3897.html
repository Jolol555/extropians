<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;    Thus a strategy for "what is to be done" might be to distance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;transhumanist technological goals from libertarianism and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;anarcho-capitalism, at least at the public-relations and educational</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;interface to the rest of the non-transcended world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And at 03:44 PM 3/23/97 GMT, Guru George commented:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sorry, but this strikes me as cowardice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Does it really?  It strikes me as abundant good sense.  The alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; strikes me as narrow-minded, self-defeating sectarianism.</i><br>
<p>
It's not cowardice, but it is short-sightedness, something Extropians<br>
should certainly work against.<br>
<p>
Support of high-tech transhumanist goals is good, but what good will it<br>
be if we get jailed for acting on those goals when they arrive because<br>
we failed to keep our politics in line with our goals?  Where will we be<br>
if we are prevented from discovering the new technologies we need by<br>
failing to use effective epistemology?<br>
<p>
This is the same argument libertarians hear constantly: Why don't<br>
you work to reduce government without being so vocal about drug<br>
legalization?  Why don't you concentrate on civil rights instead<br>
of being so negative about taxes? <br>
<p>
Well, the questions could easily be reversed: Why doesn't the LP<br>
concentrate on the evils of drug prohibition and less on the anti-<br>
government rhetoric?  Why don't they work to lower taxes, and spend<br>
less time on unpopular ideas like legalizing prostitution?  Or in<br>
the present case, why don't Extropians spend more time concentrating<br>
on real-world, immediate goals like libertarian politics and<br>
evolutionary epistemology rather than sci-fi fantasies?<br>
<p>
The LP supports policies because they are consistent with a single<br>
vision.  It is that vision we believe in, and we would lose sight of<br>
it if we chopped it up into pieces.  Extropianism is a vision, and<br>
that vision has consequences in /all/ fields of human endeavor.  It<br>
is not mere stubbornness to be consistent in that vision, because we<br>
are open to changing as our vision clarifies and the environment we<br>
hold it in changes.  But it would be narrow minded, perhaps even<br>
evasive, to shy away from parts of the vision just because they aren't<br>
popular yet. <br>
