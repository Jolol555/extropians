In a message dated 97-03-30 06:38:57 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since I believe that only societies that discover capitalism will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  able to develop the requisite technology,</i><br>
<p>
One of the most impressive things (well, OK, the ONLY impressive thing) about<br>
USSR was it's commitment to technology and space exploration.<br>
<p>
In my understanding of Extropy, anrarcho- capitalism is seen as a means to<br>
create the only viable economic environment which aids change and rapid<br>
growth.<br>
However, it is not technology per se that capitalism will foster, but the<br>
individual freedom to utilize it to our own ends.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I doubt that we will find many</i><br>
<i>&gt;star-roving socialist/fascist collectives - the only ones we do find</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be ones that stole the technology from the capitalist ones, just</i><br>
<i>&gt;like here on earth. </i><br>
<p>
In anarchy, any roving band of anything can just as easily 'steal' technology<br>
( if by that you mean figuring out what has already been done and<br>
implementing it to eveil ends). They could colonize offworld,  and under a<br>
non restrictive government, do all and anything history has shown us humans<br>
are capable of!<br>
What the original post was asking about, IMO, seemed to be how we would be<br>
percieved *developementally* as a culture, should we be able to propell<br>
ourselves outward, and just how far along we are now. This concern over<br>
technology developing ahead of our psychology is quite valid, and is often<br>
brought up in a constructive manner. Sometimes it is used by Luddlike<br>
characters to inspire fear of technology.<br>
Again, to dismiss it, because we feel WE, as transhumnists, have evolved- is<br>
not addressing a solution!<br>
<p>
I hope we as a planet are evolving mentally and psychologically toward a<br>
balanced, sane, rational state - it has been suggested that this takes work.<br>
I personally see many people who I would not trust with a glue gun ; ) never<br>
mind genetechs, SI weapons or replicators!<br>
