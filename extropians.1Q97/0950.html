In a message dated 97-01-20 12:00:33 EST, it is written:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; <br>
<i> &gt; While Christianity's main meme of "do unto others as you would have done</i><br>
<i> &gt; to you" is a very good meme [snip]</i><br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;	I was not making reference to the ethical value of the meme, but<br>
 rather it's ability to spread.  Christianity could state "kill all farm<br>
 animals and torture your neighbor continually", and whereas that wouldn't<br>
 be "ethically" good, as long as the meme spreads and people follow the<br>
 word, it is a "good" meme.<br>
 ______________________ &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Good for whom, good for what.. alas, the old ethical problem, not solved by<br>
mathematics or a double blind test (for those of you who always want to go<br>
THERE).<br>
<p>
In that logic, Nazis have a good meme too.... Santeria is a great example of<br>
memes changing faces in order to survive. <br>
<p>
Defining good as evolutionarily viable is dangerous IMO. But it is logical to<br>
some extent. For obvious reasons.<br>
However, things that survive best are not inherently "good" for ME, a Shark<br>
is not as "good" to cuddle with as my warm fuzzy puppy, but shark has<br>
survived since prehistoric times, and although puppy is an old breed, he only<br>
goes back to about 500BC.<br>
<p>
So be careful - Christianity IMO is BAD, but bad for ME and for Extropy, not<br>
for itself. Since we are on the subject, "memes mutating in order spread" , I<br>
think this is one of the problems I have with trying to "redefine" Extropy.<br>
If we have a specific goal, ( ie: good for who-good for what goal, good for<br>
individual freedom, dynamic optimism, the singularity, technological <br>
developement, etc) we need to keep the definition flexible, but tightly<br>
monitored-allowing people to come to thier own conclusions, their own<br>
actions, yet clear on the definition, making sure it is solidly based on a<br>
positive premise. <br>
<p>
If, in  order to get media attention, Extropian  memes mutate into evil or<br>
deathist patterns, it could kill the movement. One can easily see how<br>
Cyberpunk and Nihilist Extropians would be a very easy thing to sell in the<br>
media. It may help the meme to survive, to subvert or pervert it.<br>
But negativity is entropic, so it may not be "good" in any sense of the<br>
meaning we want.<br>
<p>
If you get a famous meme without keeping the principles, IMO, you have lost<br>
the meme.<br>
<p>
I think this is very destructive BTW. <br>
One thing I LIKE about Extropy is it's insisting on quality. On standards. On<br>
focus. On positivity. <br>
