<i>&gt; He says, "Insofar as there is a dominant belief in our society today, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a belief in the magic of the marketplace.  The doctrine of laissez-faire</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism hold that the common good is best served by the uninhibited</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursuit of self-interrest.  Unless it is tempered by the recognition of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; common interest that ought to take preference over particular interests, our</i><br>
<i>&gt; present system--is liable to break down."</i><br>
<p>
Ug.  First be begins with an outright lie, then a strawman so plain it<br>
should be obvious even to a politician.<br>
<p>
(1) To test the "dominant belief in society today", it would be easy<br>
  enough to do a simple poll.  Ask 10,000 randomly selected people<br>
  which statement they most agree with:<br>
<p>
  a) "The free market can solve problems like crime, poverty, defense..."<br>
  b) "Government can solve problems like crime, poverty, defense..."<br>
<p>
  Ask yourself which statement will get more agreement.  Without<br>
  question, the latter.  So the "dominant belief" in society today is<br>
  in government, not in the free market.<br>
<p>
(2) Since he postulates that those who believe in the free market say<br>
  that it will magically solve all problems, and they are clearly wrong,<br>
  he asserts that government is superior.   First, he offers no evidence<br>
  that capitalists actually believe that, or that the conditions he<br>
  describes (like "inequality") are actually problems, or that the free<br>
  market's failures are more or fewer than government's, only that it<br>
  isn't perfect.  Well Duh.  Life's a bitch.  What else is new?<br>
<p>
"Unless tempered by the recognition of common interest..."<br>
<p>
That's the source of the problem right there.  If he postulates the<br>
existence of a "common good", of course he'll come to the conclusion<br>
that a system based on its complete rejection--capitalism--won't<br>
achieve it.  Another winner of the "Duh" prize.  A screwdriver isn't<br>
very good at setting nails.  Capitalism doesn't serve collectivist<br>
ideals.  That's not the purpose of either, so of course they fail.<br>
<p>
And to top it all off, he sneaks "our present system" into the last<br>
sentence, as if to suggest that our present system is capitalist!<br>
This is one of the most thoroughly despicable essays I've read in a<br>
long time.<br>
