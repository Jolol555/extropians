&lt;&lt;   The period of research into the cause of AIDS which considered both <br>
 agents lasted only 3 years. It ended in April 1984 when our government <br>
 announced at a press conference that HIV caused AIDS prior to the <br>
 publication of any scientific evidence.   &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
That is not correct.  It was published in 1983 not 1984 in _Science_ (the<br>
year before the U.S. announcement) with full peer review.  It was sent in<br>
1983 the all AAAS members (100,000 members?) and 30-35,000 ASM members in ASM<br>
News (I've been a member since 1976).  How convenient to forget this.  See<br>
also _Manual of Clinical Microbiology_ 5th Edition page 1011 and 1020. <br>
 <br>
The search for a viral cause of AIDS ended in 1983 when the Pasteur Institute<br>
(Barre-Sinoussi et al. Science 220:868-871 1983) blabbed their ( 10<br>
scientists) research too fast and the American's (13 scientists) saw an<br>
opportunity to steal the discovery of one of the causes of AIDS.   <br>
 <br>
HIV is probably the easiest causes to find since it has been found in<br>
millions of AIDS cases.    But, my theory is there are many more causes than<br>
HIV since this is a syndrome there are usually multiple causes.  HIV was<br>
simply the easiest cause to find.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
&lt;&lt;  Dozens of AIDS patients with Kaposi's<br>
 sarcoma or dementia have been reported to have normal immune<br>
 systems. [H. Barcellar, A, Munoz, E.N. Miller, E.A. Cohen, D. Besley,<br>
 O.A. Selnes, J.T. Becker, and J.C. McArthur, "Temporal trends in<br>
 the incidence of HIV-Related Neurological Diseases: Multicenter AIDS<br>
 cohort study: 1985-1992," Neurology, 44 (1994): 1892-1900.] &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Now just wait one minute here. . . This is a contradiction in terms "AIDS"<br>
requires a non-normal immunsystem with declining CD4+ cells down lower than<br>
0.3.   Or, you don't have AIDS.  Something is wrong with this article or more<br>
likely, your interpretation of the data.<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
&lt;&lt;  Despite years of research, no evidence can be found<br>
 that the immune system fights cancer cells, which, after all, are a part<br>
 of the host's own body. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I disagree:  What about the spontaneous cancer remission cases.  No theories<br>
on the immune system helping in that?  I seem to remember several theories in<br>
JAMA on that.  I just can't help think we have not found all the human cancer<br>
virus (besides HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) as in the non-human roux sarcoma retrovirus<br>
cancer virus.<br>
<p>
Of course, retrovirus RNA directed DNA synthesized DNA is trapped in all<br>
humans due to the incorporation into the human genone and transfered each<br>
successive generation.  The immune system apparently has a hard time finding<br>
DNA made by this process.  So the human cancer virus might not exist as a<br>
virus anymore having just become part of the "normal" human genone.<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
&lt;&lt; like to read about HIV infected chimps coming down with "AIDS-like <br>
 symptoms" after latency periods "every bit as long as it is in people."   &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
You might like to look at some older studies/reports on HIV-2 since it may be<br>
the same virus as the one causing the above chimp infections.  <br>
<p>
1.  Ayanian et al. HIV-2 in U.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 320:1422-1423, 1989<br>
2.  CDC AIDS due to HIV-2 MMWR 37:969, 1987<br>
3.  CDC Update on HIV-2 MMWR 38: 572-580, 1989<br>
4.  Clavel et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 316: 1180-1185, 1987<br>
5.  Cortes et al. HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1 infections in Brazil. N.Engl. J. Med.<br>
320: 953-958 <br>
<p>
(Also look for HTLV-3 since that is what HIV used to be called before the<br>
name changed.)<br>
<p>
Have you read Steven B. Harris, M.D. in _Skeptic_ Vol. 3 No.2 1995 esp. p. 51<br>
. . . etc.?<br>
<p>
More reports (too many?):  The first report of HIV-1 Group O AIDS infection<br>
in the U.S. is reported in _Emerging Infectious Diseases_  Vol. 2 No. 3<br>
July-Sept. 1996 p. 209 by Sullivan et al. in the same issue see p. 222 for<br>
Central African Republic HIV-1 data.<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
&lt;&lt;  HIV would have to kill T-cells while destroying brain neurons it cannot<br>
 infect and at the same time induce white blood cells and skin cells to<br>
 grow malignantly.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
But that is not required.  HIV can cause a lot of damage and set off a chain<br>
reaction far distant from the HIV itself.  Retroviral DNA becomes "part" of<br>
many cells in a body.  That's why it is a "syndrome" after all.  Retroviruses<br>
inducing cancer gene activation is a theory for example.   _Clostridium<br>
botulinum_ does the same thing neurologically without any living bacterium<br>
being present at all, through neutotoxin formation.  Human cells infected<br>
with HIV making some changes in cell/organism metabolism, like a neurotoxin,<br>
is another theory.  <br>
