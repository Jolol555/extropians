John,<br>

<i>&gt; I don't agree. Relativity is a little odd but Quantum Mechanics is utterly</i><br>
<i>&gt; bizarre. The Twin " paradox" of Relativity is not a paradox at all, it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt; something unusual that happens when things move very fast. If you want a</i><br>
<i>&gt; true paradox look for Schrodinger's Cat, and Quantum Mechanics is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; culprit.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that there is no deep paradox with this twins business, but the<br>
twins spend their whole time in timelike (slower than light) reference<br>
frames in which a well ordered causality from past to future exists.<br>
<p>
On light like reference frames, no such well ordered causality from<br>
past to future exists.  The emmission and absorption of a photon is<br>
not a well ordreed cause and effect sequence, but a single unitary <br>
event that from the photon's reference frame happens simultaneously<br>
and with no intervening distance.  From the perspective of those who<br>
live within timelike reference frames, even though the photon appears<br>
to travel though space, the absorption of the photon is already <br>
correlated with some future absorbtion event the moment it is emitted<br>
from its source.<br>
<p>
Again, this is a much deeper paradox in relativity than the twins <br>
business, a paradox that QM patches up in a consistent manner.<br>
