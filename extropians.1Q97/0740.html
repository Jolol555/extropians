Eliezer has no taste for art; he's too busy Solving the Universe.  Will an <br>
appreciation for art and for the beauty of living help Eliezer with his quest <br>
to Understand?  I don't know.  I, like Eliezer, am profoundly interested in <br>
Understanding Everything.  But I am also very practical, and I realize that my <br>
personal enjoyment of living is all that *really* matters; everything else is <br>
just a tool to help me satisfy my hedonism.<br>
<p>
I derive enjoyment from a large variety of sources; from my diverse <br>
intellectual pursuits, from various kinds of sensory experience, and from <br>
altering my state of consciousness in various ways.  All of them are very <br>
important to me, and they are actually all very related to each other.  My <br>
altered states of consciousness often enhance my sensory experiences and my <br>
intellectual prowess.  My beautiful sensory experiences often inspire my <br>
intellect and often cause my state of consciousness to be altered.  My <br>
intellect helps me understand my sensory experiences better (and how to alter <br>
my sensory environment (the 'physical world') to be the way I want it to be) <br>
and it helps me understand the basic properties of various states of mind I <br>
enter.<br>
<p>
I am a whole person, and I believe that if I neglected any of these areas, I <br>
would damage all of them together.  I *must* experience and create art. I <br>
*must* think and understand and create machines and other systems.  I *must* <br>
alter my perspective and my patterns of thought.<br>
<p>
Profoundly enjoying my moment-to-moment experiences is my ongoing goal.  For <br>
me, this requires careful attention to my sensory experiences, my emotions, <br>
and my thinking.  It requires that I challenge myself with new tasks and <br>
endeavors.  It requires that I be engaged in improving the quality of my mind, <br>
and it requires that I am developing a clearer and more profound understanding <br>
of all things.<br>
<p>
Eliezer is driven towards his far-off goals of Understanding and Knowing.  <br>
There is nothing wrong with this.  There is one thing that must be kept <br>
constantly in mind, though:  All we have, and all we will ever have is this <br>
particular moment of experience; learn to enjoy this particular moment as much <br>
as possible.  <br>
<p>
It seems like Eliezer may not value beauty, which, to me, seems like an <br>
unfortunate tragedy.  How can one who doesn't value beauty be convinced of the <br>
importance of art?  To me, a life without beauty is a life without meaning.  <br>
Of course, religious fanatics say the same thing about God -- "A  life without <br>
God is a life without meaning.".  So, we may have as much luck convincing <br>
Eliezer of the goodness of Art as the local preacher will have convincing him <br>
of the goodness of God.  It's hard to make a convert out of someone who <br>
doesn't already share your basic values and assumptions.<br>
