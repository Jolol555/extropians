It seems we have problems at defining intelligence. If we use some <br>
standard metric, like IQ, SAT or whatever (we still haven't heard any <br>
definitive numbers), somebody might argument that these metrics are not <br>
gender-neutral. But by tweaking parameters in a test until men and women <br>
scale equally (instead of a controversary topic as intelligence, let's <br>
consider such simple bodily properties as average height, weight, force <br>
measured by a hand pressure dynamometer) we finally create a caricature <br>
of a test. Intelligence is the ability to solve problems -- the more <br>
problems solved/time, and the more complicated they are, the higher the <br>
intelligence. Instead of hunting animals, gathering berrier and spear our <br>
neighbour future problems Which Matter will come from the scientific/ <br>
technological sector.<br>
<p>
Currently, we have a dearth of women in such sectors, though those few <br>
who engange in such enterprise usually perform adequately or above average.<br>
<p>
Imo, this does not mean that these are the cream de la cream (outer right <br>
fraction of the bell-shaped curve), and that the bulk is substandard. I <br>
rather think that women would do perfectly allright if they were willing <br>
to work really hard, which men do not like either, but do.<br>
<p>
_Anecdotal_ evidence. In chemistry the ratio of women to men was roughly <br>
1:1 initially. Because of long hours, lots of work and heaps of new <br>
knowledge being pounded into our heads back then, most of them dropped <br>
out in the first months. Moving to better climes, so to speak. Even more <br>
of them couldn't make the tests, because that required learning dry stuff <br>
for long hours, which they were unwilling to do. Anectdotal evidence <br>
again, personal observations by yours truly. "I can't learn this, it's <br>
too hard."<br>
<p>
I do not care whether this stuff is genetically determined, or a product <br>
of the environment. All I see is the result that there are fewer women in <br>
hard sciences (lots of them in molbio, though). Instead of an <br>
equilibration, the trend goes in an opposite direction (at least in <br>
Krautland). Ignoring this for whatever reasons, PCish or otherwise is <br>
not prudent, nor is it constructive. Developing a selective blindness for <br>
a problem does not make it go away.<br>
<p>
I am strongly pro equilibration. So let's work towards it, but please do <br>
not claim that women and men are equlibrated now. The gender <br>
specialization _will_ become obsolete after we shed the protein/DNA <br>
matrix, but this is still many decades/centuries off.<br>
