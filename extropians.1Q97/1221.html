<p>
Isn't the development of bipedalism and good hands prior to the<br>
bigtime encephalization increase made at bit more explicable by<br>
the Aquatic Ape theory that keeps showing up in the subject line<br>
without being discussed much? Bipedalism would allow a broader<br>
wading range (since presumably the duration of the aquatic clade<br>
was too short for the development of true swimming adaptations such<br>
as blubber and flippers), and good hands would be needed for<br>
exploring muddy lakebeds for food. If this take on things is so,<br>
then we would expect the aquatic clade to have existed sometime<br>
shortly before afarensis (AKA Lucy)... sometime in the four to five<br>
million years ago range.<br>
<p>
If an earlier aquatic habitat accounts for many of Lucy's features,<br>
then perhaps Calvin is right in that a post-Lucy stonethrowing ape<br>
accounts for the later encephalization, *particularly* if Calvin<br>
is right in claiming that stonethrowing adaptations are deeply<br>
connected to the development of language, which is what vastly<br>
accelerated cultural evolution.<br>
<p>
Another puzzling piece of this puzzle is the molecular-clock stuff.<br>
Last time I looked into this (admittedly a long time ago), I recall<br>
someone arguing rather strenuously that the pongid radiation (chimps,<br>
gorillas, and homo) could not have taken place more than three or<br>
four million years ago. Since Lucy looks pretty solidly on the Homo<br>
branch of that radiation (although evolution has done stranger<br>
things than allow a clade of afarensis to "backslide" into chimps<br>
and gorillas) I would guess that the estimated date for the pongid<br>
radiation has been pushed back to before the time of the Lucy<br>
fossils, but here I'm guessing. Would anyone like to elaborate on<br>
any of these points?<br>
