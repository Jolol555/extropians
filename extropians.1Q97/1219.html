PHILOSOPHY: What is Reality?<br>
Mike Cowar simply asks, "What is reality?"<br>
<p>
It is easy to answer what Criteria constitutes reality:<br>
Reality is the set of all Causal items mutually related to every <br>
percieved or experienced Effect.<br>
<p>
It is difficult to answer what is the nature of reality, because<br>
we are finite beings, with finite perceptions, and as such we will <br>
never correctly interperate all those experiences with any complete<br>
accuracy.<br>
<p>
It is thus impossible to answer what is the composition of reality...<br>
at least, in any complete sense.  We can not even be sure as to whether<br>
or not there are reality sets outside our own that have had no effect <br>
past, yet will introduce new variables to our own reality, should it one<br>
day make contact with ours.  However, such a set would then constitute<br>
a subset of our own reality, having Caused its Effects.<br>
<p>
Incomplete answers about Reality's composition are easier:  <br>
It's all Star Stuff.<br>
Star Stuff in Four Dimensions.<br>
It's all a function of Time, which in turn may be a function of<br>
some greater constant or function.<br>
Actually, it's a HilbertSpace (or maybe DilbertSpace?) Fractal<br>
that continuously branches out into endless possibilities.<br>
The more we promote life as we know it, or perhaps some more advanced <br>
extropic force we have yet to know, the more possibilities there will be <br>
into which this reality fractal will blossom.  :-)<br>
