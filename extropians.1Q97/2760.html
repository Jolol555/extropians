Some time ago someone mentioned Jefferson's belief that each generation<br>
should remake its constitution and laws; Greg Burch replied that there's<br>
a lot of wisdom encoded in parts of the law, and it would be inefficient<br>
to recreate that over and over.<br>
<p>
But we don't have to.  People can read the old laws and re-enact the<br>
good ones.  The point is to force a reconsideration of the old<br>
structures, and in modern terms get around the public good problem<br>
(people won't organize to get rid of a bad law that hurts them          <br>
slightly).  Think of it as a forest fire: the useless brush and dying<br>
trees are consumed, the healthy live.  Similarly the laws with strong<br>
justifications would be re-enacted; dross would be pruned.<br>
<p>
And I've been playing through dialogues on anarcho-capitalism in my head<br>
and re-realizing that taken literally, the US Constitution isn't that<br>
terrible a document, if anarchists were forced to acknowledge the<br>
necessity (one way or another) of some government and were concerned<br>
with limiting its spread.  And I figure that chance of disgoverning the<br>
US without a catastrophe, even if it was a provably good thing, to be<br>
quite small.  So a fair midpoint might be to pass an amendment with<br>
language like "one year from today, all laws enacted prior to today will<br>
be null and void."  (The overlap is to allow continuity between<br>
re-enactments, although testing the effects of a gap in the law could be<br>
interesting.)  It would also provide for the re-occurence of this sweep<br>
on some 10, 20, or 30 year cycle.  It should also include term limits<br>
for legislators, now easily justifiable as it makes no sense to get rid<br>
of laws if the exact same people who passed them originally are still in<br>
office.  A bumper sticker could be "Term limits for laws, not just<br>
Congressmen!".<br>
<p>
It could also serve as a benign partial test of libertarian ideas.  If<br>
we're right, and if there were a substantial debate over the laws, then<br>
many should be left dead.  If the post-purge state looks unchanged, then<br>
either flaws in our arguments will have been found, or we'll know the<br>
populace is hopeless and we should run away somewhere.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
