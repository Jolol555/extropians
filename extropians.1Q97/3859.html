It didn't sound like Velociman's friend was the "lowest common denominator".<br>
 Instead, he sounds like a lot of people to whom I've tried to express<br>
transhumanist and extropian ideas.  And this fellow didn't sound "depressed",<br>
as Davin suggests.  I'm afraid that calling such people "depressed" dilutes<br>
the clinical meaning of the word --- just as the typical leftist epithet of<br>
"fascist" for anyone to the right of a Democrat dilutes the meaning of that<br>
word.  Just because someone isn't optimistic doesn't mean they're depressed.<br>
<p>
Unless you're an "autosingulatarian" (tm) or willing for our ideas to be<br>
consigned to the fringe, I think we have to come to terms with the great mass<br>
of people who will react negatively to our ideas if they aren't better<br>
prepared and we do a better job of communicating.  With all due respect to<br>
the Randians, I don't think a Hank Rearden fantasy of the heroic inventors<br>
just ignoring the rest of society will do.  If augmentation is outlawed, we<br>
could be in for a seriously delayed ascension, folks.  <br>
<p>
Try to imagine serious uploading research if technical discussion of brain<br>
implants into "healthy" humans is prohibited in the industrialized world.<br>
 And the way things are going, just forget about genetic augmentation of<br>
healthy humans, unless the attitudes of a LOT of people change.  You're not<br>
going to be able to walk down to the local convenience store and buy genetic<br>
alteration pills like you can buy aspirin.  <br>
<p>
Yes, many developments can be achieved while pursuing goals short of explicit<br>
augmentation.  But for the really big changes, a lot of expensive research is<br>
going to have to be done with the express aim of augmentation and<br>
transformation.  That reasearch is going to have to be done by the medical<br>
establishment.  The fruits of that research are going to have to be<br>
administered by doctors.<br>
<p>
Medical doctors are very covetous of the licenses granted by the state to<br>
practice medicine.  They are loathe to risk that lucrative profession.  At<br>
least one friend of mine who has reacted negatively to transumanist ideas is<br>
a relatively young neurosurgeon: She scoffs at the idea of uploading as so<br>
far beyond our capabilities as to be fantasy and reacts with horror to<br>
concepts of radical genetic augmentation.  I KNOW she is not atypical.  I<br>
strongly suspect that she has been conditioned to recoil from the idea of<br>
augmentation (and from seeing how close it might really be) by powerful<br>
societal myths: Icarus, Faust, Paradise Lost, Frankenstein.  I believe these<br>
myths have developed to shackle those who would push too fast against the<br>
power structures of a given social paradigm.  It almost seems like the power<br>
of those myths over a specific individual's imagination grows in proportion<br>
to their personal ability to overcome them: The Faust mythos seems strongest<br>
in some of the doctors with whom I've discussed transhumanism.<br>
<p>
My point is that a cultural atmosphere of PERMISSION is, if not a<br>
prerequisite, at least a powerful facilitator of transhumanism.  In Icarus<br>
and Frankenstein, we face outright mythic PROHIBITION.  Such deeply-ingrained<br>
social mores aren't overcome by the wishful thinking of small minorities.<br>
 We've talked here before about the need to create new myths, and I think<br>
that is a very worthwhile endeavor for our "culture workers".  But the work<br>
has to proceed on many fronts at once, and the workings of "countermythology"<br>
seem likely to be too slow to benefit the generation of which I happen to be<br>
a member.  As I said in my previous post, we have to express ourselves<br>
explicitly, but be careful not to trigger those psychic faustian landmines.<br>
<p>
Oh, and by the way, Velociman, I got the reference in your subject line:<br>
"What is to Be Done" was the title of Lenin's pamphlet on revolutionary<br>
practice.<br>
