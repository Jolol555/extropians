Me:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;In 1987 Chet Fleming self-published a book called "If We Can Keep A</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Severed Head Alive"...Polinym Press...</i><br>
<p>
QueenMUSE:  <br>
<i>&gt;...yeah - GREAT TITLE!!! but...{snip}...didn't he warn of the horrors</i><br>
<i>&gt;or dangers of this technology? and ask that no one ever use it?</i><br>
<p>
Sort of. There is an subtle tone of paranoia throughout the whole work.<br>
He is particularly concerned about the *secretive* development of<br>
it.  He takes for granted that it will happen - with or without his<br>
efforts - and simply wishes to influence the development.  "That's why<br>
I applied for pattent 4,666,425: to obtain legal standing to slow down<br>
and control this line of research, and to require researchers to face<br>
up to the social, legal, and ethical issues."<br>
<p>
QM:<br>
<i>&gt;And wasn't he religious to boot?</i><br>
<p>
He is clearly a monotheist, and has a preference for christianity, but <br>
speaks rather viciously of organized christian churches, and favorably<br>
of Buddha, Mohammed, and Confucius.  What I found most disturbing was<br>
the *authoritarian* flavor of his religious views.<br>
<p>
So, at worst, he is a little demented and has bizarre beliefs.  But then<br>
the same could be said of a few people on this list, yet I often find<br>
their writings to be interesting and informative.  His first 5 chapters<br>
are the best.<br>
