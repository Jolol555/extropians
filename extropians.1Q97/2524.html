I think the Extropic Art Movement can do a great deal to spread extropic<br>
ideas. It's a different approach than the solely highly verbal and purely<br>
analytical style in which extropian ideas have been presented so far.<br>
("Solely" is important here, since I do not meant that extropic art<br>
excludes this approach, it merely is not primary to it. In my view, art<br>
*shows* rather than *explains*) If extropian ideas are to spread, several<br>
approaches will be needed. Although extropian ideas may yet not be<br>
widespread enough, I'm constantly amazed at how far they have spread in<br>
such a short time. And that's just what is presented as explicitly<br>
"extropian". Many many extropian ideas have become familiar on their own to<br>
millions but not under the description "extropian".<br>
<p>
One reason I haven't been posting much recently (until today) is that I'm<br>
hard at work on my way of spreading extropian ideas: I'm at work on a book<br>
titled "The Future of Human Beings" that will be published perhaps as soon<br>
as this fall, and no later than spring '98. My approach is not to<br>
immediately fire off the most hard to accept ideas in isolation, but to put<br>
them in a developmental context to make the changes we foresee appear<br>
highly reasonable and likely.<br>
