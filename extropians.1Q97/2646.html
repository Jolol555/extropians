Me too, but I suspect that a lot of this is just due to lack of processing<br>
power. From the nature of evolution we're probably only just powerful<br>
enough to be conscious and when we have to use a lot of processing power<br>
to deal with external events we can't sustain our 'consciousness' program<br>
as well. Or in maths, something like: <br>
<p>
	Thought + Emotion + Perception = Constant<br>

<i>&gt; solve a complex mathematical problem, for example.</i><br>
<p>
Or writing software, in the famous (at least around here) "coding trance". <br>
<p>
I was reading John Lilly's autobiography ("Center of the Cyclone") on the<br>
bus from Seattle to Chicago a few months ago and he talks about this at<br>
the end in his theory of conscious states. His basic neutral state is the<br>
normal ego you're talking about here, and then above that is the "coding<br>
trance" where you stop thinking and just act. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Remember that we all start out as id, and that our ego comes along when we</i><br>

<p>
Well, Freudians do, but personally I tend to feel that ego, or at least<br>
the internal monologue which goes along with it, is a bad habit and vastly<br>
overrated. <br>
