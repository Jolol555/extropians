Reilly, please, let's have blame where blame is due. I hardly think<br>
it is productive to blame this bad business on a bunch of French<br>
literary critics, when the blame should actually be laid at the<br>
feet of a political system that is busying itself jailing potheads,<br>
mandating paperwork, collecting and spending huge amounts of taxes,<br>
trying to prevent people from buying guns by mail order, having<br>
military adventures in Bosnia, and nearly everything else under<br>
the Sun *except* catching and convicting rapists and child molesters.<br>
<p>
You must be a transcended superintelligence if your ability to<br>
trace cultural causation is so overdeveloped that you *know* that<br>
it's these particular French book-mongerers who are responsible<br>
for the bad conditions in your neighborhood of North America, and<br>
not someone nearer and more recent. I mean, seriously, isn't it<br>
possible that Bill Clinton or the legislators of your state bear<br>
a *tiny* bit more responsiblity for this state of affairs than<br>
Gilles Deleuze or whichever French academic has upset you this<br>
time?<br>
