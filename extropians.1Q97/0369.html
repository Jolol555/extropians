<p>
<p>
Unless Long Term Potentiation turns out NOT to be an important part of <br>
Long Term memory, and that doesn't seem very likely to me, my estimate of <br>
.001 bit/synapse must be closer to the truth than yours of 50 bit/synapse. <br>
<p>
The Article I referred to in the January 28 1994 Science is by Dan Madison and<br>
Erin Schuman, I would not be surprised if it earns them a Nobel Prize someday.<br>
They found that when a synapse strengthens it's functional link to another<br>
neuron that synapse releases a chemical (nitric oxide) that diffuses to many<br>
other synapses and causes those synapses to be strengthened also. If, as most<br>
think, long term memory is encoded by varying the strength of the 10^14<br>
synapses that connect the 10^11 neurons then the conclusion is obvious.<br>
<p>
Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so. Terrance Sejnowski of the Salk <br>
institute, one of the best neural modeler's in the world, certainly believes<br>
that this reduces the storage capacity of the brain. In an editorial in the<br>
same issue of Science that Madison and Schuman announced their results he<br>
says "The individual synapse cannot be the computer bit of the brain. Instead<br>
of thinking of a synapse as representing a piece of information, you can now<br>
begin thinking of a population of potentiated synapses acting together".<br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;Evolution doesn't produce complex circuitry for no good </i><br>
<i>                &gt;reason, if a simpler one would have been sufficient </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I profoundly disagree. The chance that Evolution would just stumble across<br>
the simplest solution is astronomically small. The winner in the battle of<br>
Evolution is not the one who has the perfect solution, just the one that<br>
finds a solution that is better than the competition. Evolution is slow and<br>
stupid, but I seem to remember you and I going down this road before.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;What is the purpose of a discrete, modular, pretty precise </i><br>
<i>                &gt;structure if all it is good for is storing just .001 bits. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is no purpose, Evolution just screwed up. You're not the first to be<br>
disappointed by Natures ineptitude as seen in these new findings. Roger Nicoll,<br>
a neuroscientist at the University Of California was yet another scientists<br>
quoted in the same issue, he was rather blunt:  "Very Provocative. Nature has<br>
gone to elaborate lengths to create a structural edifice that can give you<br>
synapse specificity. To then just degrade the process and let it spread<br>
around a bit, makes it seem like Nature blew it somehow".<br>
                         <br>

<i>                &gt;Ask Joe Strout, he burns any number of MFlops for hours to </i><br>
<i>                &gt;simulate just _one_ biologically realistic neuron, and far </i><br>
<i>                &gt;from running in realtime.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The complexity of an individual neuron is irrelevant, the Madison and Schuman<br>
findings are about redundancy. The point is, it may not take any more computer<br>
power to simulate many neurons than to simulate one.<br>
                     <br>

<i>                &gt;We don't know whether it [Nanotechnology] violates the laws </i><br>
<i>                &gt;of physics. It may, it may not.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nanotechnology is just the ability to move atoms with tolerances that are<br>
very small by everyday standards but still larger than the minimum tolerance<br>
allowed by Heisenberg. We've already moved atoms around with a STM, so what <br>
Law of Physics could Drexler's Nanotechnology be violating? I think it must <br>
be the same one a 1000 ton airplane would be violating.<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>                          &gt;&gt;It's your responsibility to prove it's impossible </i><br>
<i>                          &gt;&gt;not mine to prove it's possible.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Eugene:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;Wrong. Science works differently. _You_ have to prove it, </i><br>
<i>                &gt;not vice versa. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, if you say a perpetual motion machine or The Lorrey drive is impossible <br>
it's your responsibility to prove they are impossible, and you can quite<br>
easily do so by pointing out that one violates the law of conservation of<br>
energy and the other violates the law of conservation of momentum. If you say<br>
that a 1000 ton airplane is impossible you have to prove that there is a new<br>
law of Physics that places an absolute limit on the weight of flying machines.<br>
I don't think you can do that.<br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;No man-made mechanosynthesis works. A STM demonstration of </i><br>
<i>                &gt;basic set of mechanosynthesis reactions, validating computer </i><br>
<i>                &gt;runs is sufficient for _me_. We don't have such evidence</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's true we can't make molecules to order with a Scanning Tunneling <br>
Microscope (STM), or if we can we can't find them yet, detecting the product<br>
of such a reaction is probably more difficult than causing it. However there<br>
is no reason to think a STM can only do Physics and not Chemistry, if it<br>
turned out to be true that would prove the existence of some mysterious new<br>
physics we know nothing about. It would have to be mysterious indeed because<br>
we already know a STM can break a chemical bond.<br>
<p>
In the June 16 1995 issue of Science it's shown that if electrons of the <br>
correct energy are shot at an atom from the tip of a STM the atom will <br>
resonate and the resulting vibration will break the chemical bond.  According<br>
to the researchers the procedure is somewhat faster than they expected and<br>
it does not require any exotic conditions such as very low temperature.<br>
J.W.Lyding, one of the authors of this report, is quoted as saying " We'd<br>
like to make small, electronic devices on the nanometer scale".  <br>
                        <br>
Also, as you know Carbon tubes of nanometer diameter are pretty easy to make,<br>
recently it's been found that molten vanadium oxide can form a coating on <br>
these carbon tubes, the carbon can then be dissolved away using conventional <br>
chemical techniques leaving pure vanadium oxide tubes of nanometer diameter. <br>
Vanadium oxide is a powerful catalyst for many chemical reactions, so it <br>
should be possible to use them as tiny test tubes, Chemistry done very small.<br>
You could also use them as molds for all sorts of different materials.<br>
