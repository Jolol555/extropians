Greg Burch is much too kind in response to Gregory Houston's rant - <br>
and it was a rant: accusing "so many people" of "completely ignoring" <br>
their minds, out of "laziness, laziness, laziness, laziness".<br>
<p>
Gregory thinks that subjective reality can be studied objectively and <br>
that this has not been tried before.  Most of his examples are yogic <br>
feats of self-control or idiot-savant abberations.<br>
<p>
There's a nice little place Gregory might like where his approach has <br>
been practiced for thousands of years.  He could join the <br>
inward-looking Brahmins in contemplating the various degrees of <br>
ecstasy and the endless patterns of homologous forms, memorizing the <br>
Vedas, and so on. Leaving us Kshatriyas (politicians), Vaisyas <br>
(scientists) and Sudras (menial mundane masses) to our "lazy" pursuits <br>
of physical and cultural development.  Or, Gregory could be a little <br>
bit more high-tech and join the Solipsist Nation described in Greg <br>
Egan's _Permutation City_.<br>
<p>
A while back, Gregory provided a useful URL to some essays by Claude <br>
Rifat.  I found some interesting information on psychedlics and <br>
neurochemistry, and some appalling philosophy.  (From <br>
<a href="http://www.dog.net.uk/claude/dreams.html">http://www.dog.net.uk/claude/dreams.html</a>)<br>
&lt;Just see how people are running into exceedingly primitive <br>
computer-generated virtual realities. Imagine what would happen if all <br>
people could go, at will, into the ultimate virtual reality of their <br>
own mind!!! The mercantilistic society which now prevails would just <br>
become extinct as, in our endoreality, we can achieve everything we <br>
want at no cost at all. The only cost is learning. In such a future, <br>
life would be more tranquil as people would obviously cease to compete <br>
and desperately run after "exoreal" objects in order to run, instead, <br>
after their own informational objects.&gt;<br>
<p>
Where does he think the models for our internal "informational <br>
objects" come from if not from experience in the exoreality?! Claude <br>
then goes on to relate his wonderful visions of buttocks turning into <br>
bananas and mushrooms turning into tables, along with the ecstasies <br>
that can be made to accompany these revelations. Yet, for some <br>
perverse reason, most people (who, BTW, also dream these things every <br>
night, and are also, for the most part, only too aware of their own <br>
emotions) persist in such "lazy" exoreality activities as eating, <br>
drinking, breathing, working, playing, raising families, contributing <br>
to their community...<br>
<p>
Apparently having primarily the reference of "a select group of people <br>
who I have cultivated similar experiences with", Gregory seems <br>
ignorant of the extent to which other educated people, both scientists <br>
and political types, have already explored (and documented) their <br>
subjective realities while still maintaining productive contact with <br>
objective reality.<br>
<p>
I make an effort to examine and catalog every dream I can recall. Not <br>
having had access to LSD for many, many years, I sometimes thrive on <br>
the effervescent patternist trances provided by piracetam (among other <br>
things). I enjoy discovering the fundamental forms, feelings and <br>
forces that pervade both my fantasies, friends, family and exoreality <br>
functions.  But, after over 20 years of this exploration, I find that <br>
while these flights of fantasy are fortifying and occasionally <br>
enlightening, they are, after all, cartoons, caricatures, and have <br>
value (aside from entertainment) only so far as they can be applied to <br>
exoreality.<br>
<p>
I have no problem with the solipsist who is truly so and minds his own <br>
business; but, when he starts bothering me with his begging bowl... <br>
Well, talk about biting the hand that feeds you!<br>
<p>
Consider the Australian aborigines, certainly connoisseurs of the <br>
Dreamtime, but they hardly use their visions to just contemplate <br>
endless abstractions (or turn themselves into calculating <br>
thermostats), they use them to gain insights into the creatures, <br>
plants and harsh environments they must understand so well in order to <br>
survive and thrive.  The real pleasure, and the only true creativity, <br>
comes when we are able to merge the endo and exo realms.<br>
<p>
In his 1994 novels, Poul Anderson offered some insights on the future <br>
extremes of endo vs. exo approaches to life:<br>
&lt;09/10/94. Finished Poul Anderson's "The Stars Are Also Fire": The <br>
inorganic intelligence of the Cybercosm and the Teramind seek the <br>
"transfinite": "Within the finite time to singularity, an infinite <br>
number of events can take place, an infinity of thoughts ... Whether <br>
the transfiguration be freezing or fiery, awareness will endure and <br>
evolve forever. Long, long before then ... it will know all things <br>
that exist ... and lovingly set them aside. Its own works - arts, <br>
mathematics, undertakings, unimaginable for ages to come - are what <br>
shall occupy its eternity ... By its nature, the cybercosm must seek <br>
for absolute knowledge; but this required absolute control, no wild <br>
contingencies, nothing unforeseeable except the flowerings of its <br>
intellect. The cybercosm was totalitarian." On the other hand: <br>
"Demeter Mother [her awareness replicated &amp; distributed among the <br>
birds and bees, the flowers and trees, perhaps in some nanotech, viral <br>
manner] is the ancient life, organic, biological ... She will always <br>
be of the material universe and its wildness, its chaos, its <br>
mortality. Never will her intellect be pure and wholly free." As She <br>
says [in "Harvest of Stars"]: "I am content, but I can never be <br>
fullfilled. No living creature ever can be; and that is the real <br>
miracle of life."&gt;<br>
<p>
As for Gregory's claims that<br>
&lt;We are matter, localized energy, whats to say that with sufficient <br>
intermiediary steps that we could not move on from bio-feedback to <br>
controlling our energy in new and profound ways. [Snip] Could we not <br>
travel great distances by merely changing the structure of our own <br>
energy, modifying ourselves so that we could propel ourselves at and <br>
sustain high speeds.&gt;<br>
<p>
I have studied Carlos Casteneda's investigations of these <br>
possibilities for decades and, given some *useable* holonomic model of <br>
reality, there may be something to these type of claims for a <br>
'non-technical'  distributed existence.  Certainly Moravecian platonic <br>
materialism seems to be moving in this direction. But (in Casteneda's <br>
case), talking vaguely about human beings as 'energy fields' is not <br>
science.  Also, even the advanced shamanic disciplines described by <br>
Casteneda recognize the need for the complementary practice of *both* <br>
'Dreaming' (remote-sensing / passive witnessing) and 'Stalking' <br>
(telepresence / interaction) with the physical world under 'altered' <br>
states of consciousness.  Dreaming is concerned with remapping the <br>
'sensory homunculus', while Stalking is concerned with remapping the <br>
'motor homunculus', and 'Seeing' is the ability to comprehend <br>
every-day reality, in some non-local way, with these remapped mental <br>
models.<br>
<p>
The point of the above discussion, of some fascinating techniques that <br>
I'm nevertheless very skeptical of, is that even these advanced <br>
shamanic disciplines do not try to create some false dichotomy between <br>
the 'inner world' and the 'outer world'.  You can lose yourself in <br>
solipsism like Poul Anderson's Teramind, or you can engage the <br>
objective reality in a biotechnical way.<br>

"You never enjoy the world aright, till the sea itself flows in your <br>
veins, till you are clothed with the Heavens, and crowned with the <br>
Stars; and perceive yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world, <br>
and more so, because others are in it who are everyone sole heirs as <br>
well as you."  - Thomas Traherne, _Centuries of Meditation_<br>
