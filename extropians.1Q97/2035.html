It seems useful to compare communications in different systems.<br>
In the human brain, there is no money passed from one group of neurons<br>
to another.  Neither there is any money in an ecology.<br>
<p>
However, brain, economy and ecology all have working system logic beyond<br>
that of their parts, and it is communicated between the parts.<br>
<p>
I will simplify the issues a bit, but without loss of relevance:<br>
<p>
 In each communication, there is a sender, a recipient, and a message.<br>
The communication has a value in the system, this value is passed and<br>
acknowledged, in terms of passing a resource together with the message,<br>
or reference to a resource, or some signal related to some resources being<br>
eventually passed somewhere in the system.  This allows the system to<br>
support good transactions and inhibit bad ones, at least in general.<br>
The value sometimes may be expressed in money - which is great, as it<br>
is a generic quantified measure of value.  Sometimes in may be expressed<br>
in your memory: "this is such a nice person, to do such a thing!  I should do<br>
something like this elsewhere sometime too!".   Etc.  The cost of feedback <br>
transaction, or its medium, is unrelated, and better be low.<br>
<p>
  An interesting issue is that the decision on making a transaction, or an<br>
idea<br>
that a transaction should be made, is of great value by itself.  If the<br>
system has<br>
any intelligence, these meta-transactions (between an entity that figured<br>
out that<br>
a transaction should take place, and the ones actually taking part in it)<br>
appear<br>
crucial.  Paying for meta-transaction on the market is usually difficult,<br>
that's why<br>
in intelligent systems (like humans or corporations) the decision-making part<br>
(brain or managers) is usually directly coupled with executive part (body or<br>
employees) - which doesn't mean that the evaluations of the communication's<br>
utility are not passed from decision-making and executive parts and back.<br>
<p>
  I am quite sure that any super/meta-intelligence would be based on a huge<br>
web of subsystems doing each other harms and favors and communicating<br>
their assessments of the values of these transactions to each other and third<br>
parties.  On the system level, these assessments can be represented as a<br>
single<br>
number; on some lower level, among the participants of the transactions, more<br>
complex structured descriptions are necessary.<br>
<p>
  Economics deals only with the single factor (money); more complex<br>
descriptions<br>
of values are not yet formalized on the general level (though messages<br>
themselves<br>
often obey complex communications protocols).  Maybe, they will be, at some<br>
point,<br>
and then we'll have non-scalar economics.  Or maybe, they won't, and there<br>
will be<br>
only subject-dependent complex formalisms.<br>
