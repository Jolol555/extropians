<i>&gt;Oh boy!  This will be a must-buy book!</i><br>
<p>
[[Thank you, Carl. I have one chapter of this particular project.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The only example this author </i><br>
<i>&gt;knows of is Larry Niven's "Ringworld", a ring the diameter of Earth's</i><br>
orbit, circling a sun, <br>
<i>&gt;and wide enough to contain oceans and continents. It, unfortunately, had to</i><br>
be built of <br>
<i>&gt;"Unobtainium" to perform this mighty feat.</i><br>
<p>
Also, the "Orbitals" appearing in some novels by Iain Banks, "The Player of<br>
Games", "Consider Phlebas", "Use of Weapons" and "Excession".  These are<br>
rings like you describe, but they have a radius chosen so they rotate in one<br>
day and produce one gee on the inside.  This permits a comfy day-night cycle<br>
without the use of mirrors.  My calculations indicate they have a radius of<br>
1.9 million kilometers, and a tangential velocity of 21.8 km/sec.  In the<br>
books, they're built of Unobtanium, but they might not have to be!  Pure<br>
diamond is restricted to a tangential velocity of 17.5 km/sec; buckyfiber<br>
may be capable of 21.8 km/sec (I haven't done that calculation).<br>
<p>
[[I’ll check it out! I’m using 150 Gpa (!) as the Ultimate Tensile Strength <br>
of Buckyfiber. I don’t know its speed of sound.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     "Carbon Fiber" (also mis-named </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Graphite Fiber") </i><br>
<p>
It's a fiber consisting of pure graphite, i.e. carbon.  How is this a misnomer?<br>
<p>
[[As I understand it, Carbon Fiber come in different grades, and is made by pyrolyzing <br>
various polymeric hydrocarbons, like rayon or nylon. The resulting fiber is (*I think*)<br>
a mixed up conglomeration of sp2 and sp3 hybrid bonds. Maybe it is mostly graphitic-<br>
I’ll put that aside aside.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The shell needs to be about three meters thick for structural reasons, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Is that counting the dirt, trees, etc that one will want spread across <br>
the<br>
interior?  If not, how thick are you assuming these amenities are?<br>
<p>
[[I gave a safety factor of three to the shell for the slag and the <br>
atmosphere- so it will have <br>
to be thicker if you want serious dirt. I was assuming a few inches <br>
average.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and another three </i><br>
<i>&gt;meters of slag should be sprayed on the outside, for radiation </i><br>
protection.<br>
<p>
Why spin the slag?  Put it in a nonrotating shell well away from the<br>
cylinder, and you save big on structural mass.<br>
<p>
[[Yes, this will work too. I was looking at precessing the spinning <br>
mass in<br>
Solar free orbit, e.g at Earth-Sun L5, which a non-spinning component <br>
would<br>
complicate.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As this is an "open-air" design, the ends only have to come up from </i><br>
the<br>
cylinder wall <br>
<i>&gt;about 150 kilometers, and can be very thin near the top, as will be </i><br>
the<br>
enclosed <br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere. </i><br>
<p>
That gives an atmospheric half-life of only 60,000 years.  Why not make <br>
the<br>
wall a little higher?  You get a factor of ten in half-life for every <br>
10 km<br>
of height.<br>
<p>
[[Only 60,000 years eh?. BTW, I just guessed at the height. Did you use <br>
a<br>
planetary or planar gas kinetic equation for this? Assuming a mean free <br>
path <br>
on the order of100 Km, a good portion of the escaping molecule flux <br>
ends up <br>
back in the atmosphere-on the other side of the world!]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, </i><br>
meaning<br>
each point on the <br>
<i>&gt;interior living surface has about 150 Km of atmosphere above it, and </i><br>
then<br>
700 Km of <br>
<i>&gt;nothing. Looking upward, at an angle, one can still see the stars.</i><br>
<p>
It will be very bright at night, with a 28 degree wide arch of sunlit <br>
land<br>
spread across the sky.  The stars will be too dim to be seen.  This is <br>
an<br>
argument for a narrower ring, or perhaps some sort of parasol (sleep <br>
mask?).<br>
<p>
[[Yeah, I was thinking “sleep mask”. It’s in the accompanying drawing, <br>
along with <br>
the (morphing) mirrors and some radial cabling.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   That was a lot of work, but what is a World worth?</i><br>
<p>
About ten trillion dollars, if you're trying to sell it to present-day<br>
Americans.  If you're trying to sell it in the future, who knows?  Land<br>
might be dirt cheap.<br>
