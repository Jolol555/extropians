Actually I was thinking more about basic biology. Women hold the secret<br>
to life, after all. I'm not a male supremacist. However, I'm getting to<br>
be a *white* supremacist, a position I hope will generate even more learned<br>
postings from extropians. (I should get the $5).<br>
<p>
Hmmm, could the Shaper/Mechanist conflict in Sterling's _Schismatrix_<br>
be a projection of gender issues? It's "intuitively obvious" to me that<br>
the Shapers = female genius while Mechanists = male genius. Can anyone<br>
really claim that this is not obvious and most likely true? (As a metaphor<br>
more than a generalization, at least).<br>
<p>
Mostly though, I'm not bothering to argue because I don't have the time.<br>
Between a full-time job and a sideline working on numerous web sites, I<br>
barely have time to sleep, much less post erudite messages to this<br>
list. (If I did, I would have thanked Amara Graps for her post entitled<br>
Some Words About Prigogine, which was especially interesting to me after re-<br>
reading _Schismatrix_ for the 3rd time (tip for first-timers: don't try<br>
following the plot. You'll find out you're turning back a few pages to<br>
find out how many years or *decades* have passed since the events of the<br>
previous chapter. Every few pages there's some of the most transcendent<br>
"extro-poetry" I've encountered.))<br>
<p>
I would have replied directly to Eliezer's post, but I don't have time<br>
to read him any more.<br>
<p>

PS. Despite the white supremacy bit, I don't discriminate to individuals.<br>
I gladly admit that there are many millions of females and nonwhites<br>
much more intelligent, productive, and better-looking than myself.<br>
