&lt;When browsing through various local bookshops today I noticed the <br>
following book: HAL, the Legacy (or something) from MIT Press. It <br>
features a series of interviews with several major movers from AI <br>
field &amp; otherwise, e.g. Marvin Minsky and Stephen Wolfram, etc. on <br>
behalf of the legendary 2001 movie by S. Kubrick.  Intelligently <br>
written, the book contains criticisms of the 2001 movie and an <br>
analysis what has been achieved, what is yet lacking, and what the <br>
reasons might be. Highly readable.&gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps HAL is now becoming an icon for computer intelligence because <br>
the original "2001" movie had the HAL 9000 system being activated on <br>
12 Jan 1997 (supposedly because Kubrick thought, at the time, that <br>
this was sufficiently far in the future for such an AI to be <br>
feasible!)<br>
<p>
This week's Computerworld (a mainstream information systems newspaper) <br>
contained a 'tribute' to this where, supposedly, the University at <br>
Urbana (Illinois) is actually going to activate a system they will <br>
call HAL on this date.  However, the article wasn't too clear about <br>
whether there was going to be a real system or whether they were just <br>
refering to where HAL from the movie was built.<br>
<p>
The article was primarily an brief interview with Marvin Minsky, <br>
Nathan Myhrvold, James Hogan and Nicolas Negroponte on the feasibility <br>
of computer intelligence (with nothing that anyone on these lists <br>
wouldn't be familiar with).  I did think it was interesting (at least <br>
for such a mainstream publication) that they had a sidebar about <br>
computers and souls where Minsky says souls, if they have any function <br>
at all, would be programmable.<br>
