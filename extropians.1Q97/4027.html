But typicially you will be typical :-).  Of course if you have some<br>
unique info that others don't have, they can expect that your specific<br>
opinion must differ from their uncertain intermediate opinion.  The<br>
hard (but not impossible) thing to explain is how they might know<br>
you have access to unique info, and know your specific opinion, and<br>
yet still choose to disagree.<br>

<p>
Is opinion divergence on matters of fact, where each side knows of the<br>
other's opinion, really ubiquitious among ordinary people?  I'm not so sure.<br>
Consider these alternative explanations for common apparent divergence:<br>
1. Disputes over values using the language of disputes over facts. <br>
2. Disputes most people think are re values, but others know are re facts.<br>
3. Incentives to signal no fear of crowd, ability to think by self<br>
4. Forums biased toward presenting (clear n vivid) extreme views <br>
5. Advocates with interests, eg lawyers, rewards to early idea advocates<br>
6. A minority who like to shock &amp; be contrary<br>
7. A minority who consistently make the error of ignoring other's opinions<br>
8. Random cognitive errors among pitoval people who won't revisit issues.<br>
9. Ignorance that there are reasonable people with differing opinions<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd say most if not all people have their opinions driven by memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;replication (as exemplified by fashion and religion) and not a</i><br>
<i>&gt;passable Bayesian approximation. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Interestingly, science seems to conform to the predictions of this "community</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Bayesian agents" model much better than society as a whole. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;would indicate that scientists, at least while working in their fields, are</i><br>
<i>&gt;more "rational" than the population as a whole </i><br>
<p>
Actually, the phychology of science evidence seems pretty conclusive<br>
that the cognitive strategies of scientists are not much different<br>
from ordinary folks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a)  The population as a whole is often wrong on major, simple issues (e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt;cloning)</i><br>
<p>
Cloning is neither simple nor major for most people, and the issues on<br>
which opinions diverge are tied up in important ways with questions of<br>
value, not just fact. <br>
