I've been studying Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, from the notes at<br>
<a href="http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/comp.html">http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/comp.html</a> (especially<br>
<a href="http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/node9.html">http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/node9.html</a>). Everything<br>
but one step makes sense to me so far, so I thought I'd share...<br>
<p>
Perhaps we're soon going to have decent-sized quantum computers. At that <br>
point, if they're going to be very useful, we'll need quantum compilers <br>
to translate ordinary code into a quantum programming language like Q-gol <br>
(see <a href="http://rosebay.matra.com.au/~gregb/q-gol//index.html">http://rosebay.matra.com.au/~gregb/q-gol//index.html</a>).<br>
<p>
A note for the future: in "Quantum theory of computation and relativistic <br>
physics" (quant-ph/9701027), Alexander Vlasov (vlasov@physics.harvard.edu) <br>
writes "... it should be mentioned that in relativistic physics there is <br>
no sharp division between q-gates and q-states ...  This property of a QFT <br>
has some analogy with functional style of programming in modern computer <br>
science. In both cases there is no essential difference between data <br>
(states) and functions (operators). A function can be used as data for <br>
some other function."<br>
<p>
And just out: the preprint quant-ph/9702001 says in its abstract: "We <br>
discuss relations between decoherence and computational complexity and <br>
show that the quantum factorization algorithm must be modified in order <br>
to be regarded as efficient and realistic."  <br>

Shor's Algorithm, take one <br>
<p>
[Based on Samuel Braunstein's tutorial on quantum computation, at<br>
<a href="http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/comp.html">http://chemphys.weizmann.ac.il/~schmuel/comp/comp.html</a>.]<br>
<p>
Suppose we want to factor the number N. Here's the complete procedure<br>
that Shor follows:<br>
<p>
A: Find a number x, coprime to N.<br>
B: Find the least number r such that x^r - 1 is a multiple of N.<br>
   If r is odd, return to A and pick a new x; otherwise proceed to C.<br>
C: Since r is even, we can say<br>
   x^r-1 = (x^[r/2]-1) (x^[r/2]+1) = kN (for some k)<br>
   For each of the two lefthand factors, find its greatest common divisor<br>
   with N (for example, via Euclid's algorithm). If this isn't 1 or N,<br>
   you've found a factor.<br>
<p>
The first part of (B) is the computationally intensive part. The quantum<br>
computer finds r, in effect, by starting with the sequence (1,2,3,...,q),<br>
where q is some large number, then computing the sequence (x^0 mod N, <br>
x^1 mod N,... x^q mod N), and determining the period of this second sequence<br>
(which will be equal to r, since by hypothesis x^r mod N = 1 = x^0 mod N).<br>
<p>
Shor's algorithm requires a quantum computer with two multi-qbit registers. <br>
The first register is the read-out point, the second register is for an <br>
intermediate computation. The qbits are all two-state quantum systems,<br>
so the computer has a set of binary states of the form |0110...;1110...&gt;,<br>
or |i;j&gt; for short, where i is the value of the first register (i.e., the<br>
first set of qbits), j the value of the second register. <br>
<p>
Since it's a quantum computer, we can have superpositions of these states, <br>
so a general state of the computer has the form<br>
<p>
sum[i,j] c[i,j] |i;j&gt;,<br>
<p>
where c[i,j] is the complex coefficient of basis state |i;j&gt;.<br>
<p>
This is the quantum algorithm for carrying out (B):<br>
<p>
Step 1: Initialize the quantum computer to |0;0&gt;.<br>
<p>
Step 2: Place the first register into a superposition of all values.<br>
<i>	|0;0&gt;           -&gt; sum[m] |m;0&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Step 3: Compute f(m) = x^m mod N in the second register.<br>
	sum[m] |m;0&gt;    -&gt; sum[m] |m;f(m)&gt;<br>
<p>
Step 4: Perform a quantum fourier transform on the first register.<br>
	sum[m] |m;f(m)&gt; -&gt; sum[m,n] exp[2i(pi).mn/q] |n;f(m)&gt;<br>
<p>
(q is the number of basis states for the first register; m and n<br>
are summed only from 0 to q-1.)<br>
<p>
You can do everything up to this point on a classical computer with<br>
<p>
	Initialize c[0..q-1,0..q'-1]<br>
	For all m,n<br>
	  Let c[m,n] = 0<br>
	For m,n from 0 to q-1<br>
	  Add exp[2i(pi).mn/q] to c[m,f(n)]<br>
<p>
The quantum transformations corresponding to steps 1-4 have all been<br>
described (just not performed, outside of simulation).<br>
<p>
Step 5: "Read out" (measure, collapse) the first register.<br>
<p>
... And this is where I have a lapse of understanding. The whole <br>
point is that the quantities in Step 4 are supposed to add up to<br>
something other than zero ("interfere constructively") only for<br>
values of m which will allow you to infer r, the period of f(m).<br>
So far I haven't been able to demonstrate this to my own<br>
satisfaction, and Braunstein passes the point by in a single<br>
sentence. I'll keep trying.<br>
