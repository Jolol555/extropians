Business:  	Transhuman Posters<br>
		1.  From Cat Woman to Transhuman*<br>
<p>
Business:  I have reopened my commercial poster design business. This time,<br>
I will not be using my 4-color serigraph press because of the toxic fumes.<br>
Therefore, I am looking for anyone who has access to an electronic printing<br>
system such as an Iris or Canon.  If you either work for such an electronic<br>
printing operation, or have an investment in same, please contact me soonest.<br>
<p>
To further your interest, please let me highlight:<br>
<p>
Concept:  Transhumans of tomorrow illustrating figurative images with a mix<br>
of savior-faire, extropic thought and daring.  <br>
<p>
*FIRST DESIGN: The first poster image will be a remake of my father's award<br>
winning commercial photo of Cat Woman (Julie Newmar) of  "Batman."  The<br>
image depicted her standing in a shinny gold swim suit on the beach with a<br>
harpoon.  (Other models who posed for him were Raquel Welch, Sharon Tate and<br>
Jill St. John. )  The transhuman rendition of my father's image will be a<br>
Transhuman Woman in silicon skin.  The beach will be another environ, the<br>
harpoon might be a different wepon, perhaps something with which to compat<br>
death with.<br>
<p>
(Note:  these images will in no way be gender biased.  In fact, in<br>
pre-production are men, and other genders.)<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
<p>
