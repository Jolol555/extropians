<i>&gt; With all due respect Greg, I think that you have a bit of denial here as</i><br>

A computer cannot say something feels good in the way I can say such. It<br>
can analyze data inputted to it and come to the purely abstract<br>
conclusion that according to all its data this incoming data should be<br>
considered a "good" feeling. But it is not feeling the data. It is just<br>
running subroutines and more subroutines. All the computer has done is<br>
label the data. It has given the data a name and that is it. The<br>
computer can then be programmed to blow bells and whistles but the<br>
computer will in no way ENJOY blowing bells and whistles. It just does<br>
it. There is no way I could scare my computer, there is no way I could<br>
anger my computer, there is no way I could embarass my computer, there<br>
is no way I can give my computer pleasure or pain, no matter what data I<br>
send it or in what fashion I handle it. How is this so difficult to<br>
understand? <br>

<p>
This is not true. There is this thing called training or learning which<br>
allows us to modify our programming. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A-Greg will debate with Greg over who is real</i><br>
<i>&gt; and who is not real......</i><br>
<p>
Sure, we will be able to debate all day long. I will be emotively<br>
affected by the debate and A-Greg will not be.<br>
