As I see it, the goals of making an AI sentient are not too different <br>
than the goals to identify the importance of Democracy (in a platonic <br>
sense, as opposed to (mis)Representational Democracy):<br>
 o  If we have eyes or ears with which to perceive the world, a mind <br>
    with which to interpret it, and (at some point in life if not <br>
    immediately) a motor skill or means of communcation with which <br>
    to act upon it, then no statement of another alone can invalidate <br>
    our perceptions.<br>
 o  Even dogs and dolphins have become creatures whose perceptions<br>
    have contributed to the well-being of society.<br>
 o  If an AI has no link to percieve the outside world, then it<br>
    contributes nothing to the real world.  If it acts upon realworld<br>
    data, however, even if inaccurately modeled by programmers, then<br>
    it has potential to contribute something real in return.  There <br>
    is nothing immoral about flipping the switch on an unreal AI<br>
    that you own.  If, however, the AI can perceive more of the world<br>
    than its programmer, along with the causes and effects of the things <br>
    it perceives, then there is an argument that it should be seen as<br>
    a sentient lifeform.<br>
<p>
There is increasing likeliness of AIs existing with "superhuman sensorium,"<br>
considering the accelerated growth of the web.  (Granted, some fleshbound<br>
web.inhabitants seem to demonstrate Artificial Stupidity, but bear with me <br>
on this just a moment.)  The more webcams that go up, and the more databases<br>
that become accessible, the more an AI can feast its learning upon a<br>
semi-real world out there.  Still, there should be a way for the AI to <br>
improve its 'Real' Intelligence:<br>
<p>
 o  As in human thinking, it should form its knowledge base twofold:<br>
    Learning to Associate Like-properties of items (Inductive Reasoning, <br>
    or Right Brain Thinking), and Learning to Discern Differences from <br>
    the logical chain of evidence (Deductive Reasoning, or Left Brain <br>
    Thinking).<br>
          NOTE: Like many humans, it should also (hopefully) grow to the<br>
          the ultimate discerment: Learning which differences make <br>
          no appreciable difference.  Color and Gender have no bearing<br>
          on the validity of one's perceptions.<br>
 o  It should have complete notes about the sources from which it gained<br>
    each item of knowledge.  Thus, if it needs to assess the veracity of<br>
    a discovery, it can determine how much imperical evidence exists to<br>
    back its claim, or see which suppositions rightly invalidate a<br>
    hypothesis.<br>
 o  While Effects witnessed from Direct-World inputs (webcams? <br>
    radiotelescopes?) are more irrefutable than human interperatation,<br>
    the AI should be able to measure an item's probable veracity<br>
    by according to the directness of experience in its input.<br>
    (For example, a live camera on a rock concert could teach it more<br>
    than a text report on the concert, which in turn teaches more than<br>
    some jerk who says "Van Halen sucks" without any indication that<br>
    the author has even heard one of their songs...)<br>
 o  With an adequate knowledgebase of Causes and Effects, an AI can <br>
    forecast Consequences.  ('...Having eaten of the Tree of the <br>
    Knowledge of Good and Evil, they have become as gods...')<br>
    Once it can weigh the Consequences to see how much their forecast<br>
    actions (or inactions) can benefit a preprogrammed goal ("To Serve<br>
    Humans" ?!), the AI can then decide its own actions.<br>
<p>
It is at this point which we must decide if an AI can gain status of <br>
citizenship... If it is truly intelligent, can an "owner" have any <br>
right to invalidate its perceptions?  Does it thus have our same <br>
"Freedom of Speech"?  Will it become a Ward of the State if its <br>
owner can no longer supply a minimum requirement of processing <br>
power?<br>
<p>
NOTE: My apologies to those zoologists and medical professionals who <br>
might object to my use of the term "AI" to mean Artificical Intelligence.<br>
It is not intended to be confused for three-toed sloths, nor "Artificial<br>
Insemination."<br>
