Message #7975<br>
From: Transoniq Hacker &lt;trnsoniq@teleport.com&gt;<br>
Subject: Re uploading<br>

<p>
All this discussion reminds me of the old line twins sometimes use<br>
when some wit asks them, "How do you tell each other apart?"<br>
<p>
"Well, I'm always here, but the other one is sometimes gone."<br>
<p>
Well, I don't know about the rest of you zombies, and maybe I'm missing<br>
something, but to me it doesn't really matter (at least as it pertains<br>
to this) if the universe is discrete or smooth, infinite or finite,<br>
analog or digital. And it doesn't really matter if machines can be<br>
built that pass the Turing test, have emotions and self-circuits and<br>
problems with the wife and all the rest. And if a simulation of a can<br>
opener can ever open a can or only simulated cans. And if they duplicated<br>
me on a system that used neurons or neural nets, and whether they called<br>
it a computer or called it something else.<br>
<p>
If they duplicated me atom by atom - right down to the electrons in my<br>
self-circuit - he'd still be over THERE, and I'd still be over HERE. And<br>
he could pass all the Turing tests and memory tests, and they could run<br>
him for 9 months to make sure that the chaos goblin doesn't get him. And<br>
he and everybody who knows me could agree that, boy, *they* sure can't<br>
tell the difference. And this would all be very interesting.<br>
<p>
But, call me old-fashioned, but the *second* somebody says, "It seems<br>
to have worked. Two things that are identical in all ways are the same<br>
thing. A *IS* A. We might as well dispose of the original..." well, he'll<br>
be over THERE, and *I'll* be out the goddamn door.<br>
<p>
