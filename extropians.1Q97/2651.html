<p>
<p>
<p>
There is more and less functional. Something that pretends to be<br>
<p>
functional is, by degree, more or less functional in pretending to be<br>
<p>
functional, but not functional beyond pretending to be functional.<br>
<p>
Something that pretends to be functional is functional, just not in the<br>
<p>
way it pretends, e.g, we often make models of things which are not<br>
<p>
functional, but they pretend to be. A model space shuttle has<br>
<p>
functionality as pretending to be a functional space shuttle.<br>
<p>
You can call functionality real functionality and then true<br>
functionality if you want to, but there is no need to make this<br>
isomorphism. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
I am invoking Occam's razor here. There is no reason to use the term<br>
<p>
truth when speaking of functionality. It is an extraneous and<br>
<p>
unnecessary term. Something is either more or less functional in its<br>
<p>
intended purpose. There is no reason for me to say it is truely<br>
<p>
functional or falsely functional. The word is not needed.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't understand what difference you see</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; between what you call 'functionality' and truth, facts.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Thus showing that the term truth is not necessary, I will now list why<br>
<p>
it is less functional than either the term useful or the term<br>
<p>
functional. The following are my reasons for proposing this shift in<br>
<p>
terminology. The following details the differences between functionality<br>
<p>
and truth. [This is pretty lengthy, a great deal of recapitulation, but<br>
most of it has been informed and refined by our unfolding discussion.<br>
There is of course, as there will always be, room for further<br>
refinement.]<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
1. The words useful or functional have a more direct association to our<br>
<p>
emotive needs and desires and thus to motivation, volition, and<br>
<p>
intention. Science is motivated by desire, even the [unnecassary] desire<br>
<p>
for truth is a desire. The term truth inhibits this realization. It is<br>
<p>
too abstracted. It is not as functional to believe that we are motivated<br>
<p>
by truth as it is to believe that we are motivated by functionality.<br>
<p>
When we realize that we are motivated by functionality, by our own needs<br>
<p>
and desires, then we are more likely to question those motivations. But<br>
<p>
if we believe we are motivate by the almighty truth, then there is<br>
<p>
nothing to question. We do not question our motivations.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
2. If we do not feel the need to question our motivations then we are<br>
<p>
bound to remain determined.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
3. If we do not feel the need to question our motivations then we will<br>
<p>
not delve into the subconscious in order to make conscious those<br>
<p>
underlying forces which are determining our motivation. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
4. The term truth has an epistemological bias. It is biased to a<br>
<p>
particular modality of consciousness. It does not promote modalities of<br>
<p>
consciousness which will allow an individual to attain more emotive<br>
<p>
control, and thus more rational control. It does not promote the<br>
<p>
exploration of endogenous reality. Our emotions effect our centreal<br>
<p>
nervous system (CNS) and vice versa. If we learn to control our emotions<br>
<p>
as connoisseurs of consciousness, then we can sustain modes of<br>
<p>
consciousness such as rationality and ecstasty for extended periods of<br>
<p>
time. Just as conflicting emotions often combine to create new emotions,<br>
<p>
perhaps we will discover new modes of rationality when such modes<br>
<p>
dynamically clash in the same moment with some form of ecstasy.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
5. The term truth has an objective bias. Thus we compound its inhibition<br>
<p>
of the exploration and understanding of endogenous reality.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
6. The term truth implies the absolute. If I call a theory true it is<br>
<p>
less likely to be questioned than if I call that theory functional. It<br>
<p>
is much easier to imagine something more functional, than to imagine<br>
<p>
something more true.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
7. The term truth requires that when we say one thing we mean something<br>
<p>
*slightly* different, e.g., "when we call something true that means we<br>
<p>
*conjecture* it to be true." When we think of things as more as less<br>
<p>
functional we do not run into this problem. When we say something is<br>
<p>
functional, we mean it is functional. We are saying exactly what we<br>
<p>
mean. There is no room for confusion here. The use of the term truth<br>
<p>
confuses the signified with the signifier. Another case of this is when<br>
<p>
we say that it is true that x is y, when x is the particular and y is a<br>
<p>
constant symbolic ideal. It would be less confusing to say that x<br>
<p>
functions as a y.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
8. Truth is an authoritarian concept whereas functionality is not.<br>
<p>
Functionality is thus better suited to a system such as pancritical<br>
<p>
rationalization.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
9. A theory is only true in relation to reality, but a theory is<br>
<p>
functional in relation to reality *and* in relation to other theories.<br>
<p>
This also makes functionality better suited to PCR. A functional theory<br>
<p>
is still open to question where as a true theory is not so. It is much<br>
<p>
more difficult to criticize something we have given the exalted status<br>
<p>
of true than it is to question something we have merely shown to have a<br>
<p>
degree of functionality.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
10. Truth is an ontotheological sublimation of God. It is a platonic<br>
<p>
primitive. An *ideal* absolute. It is a static unchangeable concept, and<br>
<p>
is thus not appropriate to science. Usefulness or functionality are not<br>
<p>
even nouns, as adjectives they are much less static. As God could not be<br>
<p>
questioned, neither can truth. Science has no place for unquestionable<br>
<p>
things.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
11. Many people believe that the terms of a theory are actual entities<br>
<p>
when in many cases this is not true. They think this is so because of<br>
<p>
the epistemological fixation truth requires. The forces that Newton<br>
<p>
described in his theory do not necessarily exist, but they were useful<br>
<p>
to make predictions. Einstein was able to explain the very same<br>
<p>
phenomena as Newton, and more, with pure geometry. Einstein did not have<br>
<p>
to invoke Newton's forces. When we talk about functionality it is much<br>
<p>
easier to imagine the terms of a theory as arbitrary tools that do not<br>
<p>
necessarily *truely* exist. It does not matter if they exist or not as<br>
<p>
long as the theory is useful for prediction. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
12. Reality is not static and unchanging. So how could there be a static<br>
<p>
and unchanging truth that accords to it? There cannot be. The term<br>
<p>
functionality does not intrinsically say that things are static or<br>
<p>
unchanging. It is thus more useful, less confusing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
13. The sum total of all the inconsistencies in the use and meaning of<br>
<p>
truth makes it a sort of mystification. It defers the actual meaning of<br>
<p>
itself. The term function does no such thing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
14. Since function does not have a bias towards a single modality of<br>
<p>
conscioussnes, it allows us to employ a greater portion of consciousness<br>
<p>
in attempting to create artificial consciousness. Since truth has a bias<br>
<p>
towards cognitive modalities of consciousness, it is unlikely that<br>
<p>
employing it we will ever attain something which functions very well as<br>
<p>
an artificial intelligence. That thing would lack intuition, a very<br>
<p>
necessary modality of consciousness for intelligence.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
15. There is no reason why we must revert to using the concept of truth<br>
<p>
to say something is either true functionality, or false functionality.<br>
<p>
There are degrees of functionality. Something is not either functional<br>
<p>
or not functional, for some things are more functional than others. Here<br>
<p>
we employ occam's razor. Truth is an extra unnecessary term.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
16. A focus on truth leads to purely cognitive education, whereas a<br>
<p>
focus on functionality leads to cognitive, intuitive, and emotive<br>
<p>
education. Thus the latter engenders inidividuals who have the emotive<br>
<p>
control to rationalize more rigorously than the former.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
17. A focus on truth hinders genius due again to the fact that it leads<br>
<p>
to a purely cognitive education. Genius requires emotive control, and an<br>
<p>
extremely refined intuitive capacity.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
18. A person focused on truth is incapable of being as honest as a<br>
<p>
person focused on usefulness and functionality. The person focused on<br>
<p>
truth will be determined by unchecked underlying motivations,<br>
<p>
motivations that they are unaware of and have made no sustained attempt<br>
<p>
to become aware of. This is because truth's epistemological bias<br>
<p>
attempts to limit consciousness to the cognitive modalities of<br>
<p>
consciousness where functionality begins with emotion and moves up<br>
<p>
through the modalities of consciousness until it reaches its final check<br>
<p>
point in a cognitive modality. The person focused on function is then<br>
<p>
going to have made a greater attempt of making unconscious motivations<br>
<p>
conscious so that person can take responsibility for those motivations<br>
<p>
and alter those motivations as needed via rationalization.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
19. A person focused on function will be better apt at directing science<br>
<p>
because that person has become more free by degree and thus less<br>
<p>
determined than the person focused on truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
20. We can create things in the name of truth, but we cannot create<br>
<p>
things in the name of functionality. Truth can be used to justify<br>
<p>
destructive creations, whereas functinality requires that the creation<br>
<p>
itself be justified. Truth displaces and defers the purpose of creating<br>
<p>
something, whereas it is obvious with functionality that the purpose of<br>
<p>
creating something is its practical functionality, what it does and how<br>
<p>
well it does it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
21. In general, shifting from truth to functionality broadens, empowers,<br>
<p>
and impassions science. It makes science more robust, more autonomous<br>
<p>
and capable of sustaining itself. Truth, epistemology, and knowledge are<br>
<p>
limited to things we can cognitively think. Functionality deals with a<br>
<p>
much broader spectrum of consciousness which includes emotions.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
22. A shift from truth to functionality will may just be what of the<br>
<p>
things which will enable singularity.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
23. Science is intrinsically an emotive tool. It is a tool for<br>
<p>
predicting things so that we can better attain that which we need or<br>
<p>
desire. The terminology of science should thus reflect this. The term<br>
<p>
truth denies this.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
24. The concept of truth buffers people from their emotions. It makes it<br>
<p>
so they do not have to deal with them in a highly disciplined fashion.<br>
<p>
Truth is perpetuated by people who are either too lazy to deal with<br>
<p>
their emotions and subconsious. Truth is perpetuated by people who are<br>
<p>
repulsed by themselves and who thus have no desire to delve into their<br>
<p>
emotions and subconscious. Truth is perpetuated by people who fear<br>
<p>
themselves and their subconsious and who are thus unwilling to delve<br>
<p>
into their emotions and subconscious.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
25. It is more important for a person to be useful to society than for a<br>
<p>
person to be true to society. A person can question and criticize<br>
<p>
society while proposing useful reforms, thus being useful to it while<br>
<p>
not being true to it. The same can be said in relation to science.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
26. Because truth is thought to be the current goal of science, many<br>
<p>
people believe then that there can be anything greater, beyond, or<br>
<p>
transcendental of science. This is extremely misleading. Truth was the<br>
<p>
goal of religion, and then we developed philosophy. Truth was the goal<br>
<p>
of philosophy and then we developed science. Truth is the goal of<br>
<p>
science and someday we will probably develop something more useful than<br>
<p>
science. Except this time, truth will not be the goal any longer. We are<br>
<p>
going to make a shift similar as that between Newton's theory and<br>
<p>
Einstein's theory. We are going to adopt new terms in order to predict<br>
<p>
more phenomena more usefully.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
27. "The definition of truth stipulates an *ideal* scenario.  It defines<br>
<p>
what we *want*.  It doesn't help us to get there." The definition of<br>
<p>
functionality does help us to get where we want to go because it is<br>
<p>
grounded in practicality and not in idealism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
28. With a goal of usefulness, general discourse will become more useful<br>
<p>
rather than merely true. I could tell you true trivial things all day<br>
<p>
which are "true" and never attain any depth, but if we are more<br>
<p>
concerned with the communication of useful information we will progress<br>
<p>
to greater depths. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
29. Without emotion or functionality science could not even exist. No<br>
<p>
one would feel the emotion of need or the emotion of desire in order to<br>
<p>
create science. Science can exist without truth though. It can exist in<br>
<p>
a subjective world without absolute absolutes just as long as things<br>
<p>
remain nearly the same long enough for us to treat them as objective and<br>
<p>
thus to enable us to predict things. We can functionally entertain the<br>
<p>
idea of absolute things without them *truely* being absolute. Suppose<br>
<p>
what we think of as constants are merely shifting in degree at an<br>
<p>
infintessimal level beyond our ability to measure. Its possible. But in<br>
<p>
the end it does not matter as long as we can functionally consider them<br>
<p>
absolutes. Thus truth is not necessary to science whereas function is. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
30. Where truth, an authoritarean concept, hinders the dissolving of<br>
<p>
government, a focus on functionality helps prepare us for the dissolving<br>
<p>
of government. "It might not be the best word to use, anarchy, but I<br>
<p>
believe that it is in a sense where Libertarianism is leading us ...<br>
<p>
just in a sense perhaps, but in any fashion, Libertarianism requires<br>
<p>
that we take responsibility from the governement and claim those<br>
<p>
responsibilities for ourselves. In a psuedo-anarchic system we will need<br>
<p>
to have learned a great deal more about our emotions and how to<br>
<p>
effectively employ them before we can imagine such a system to remain<br>
<p>
orderly."<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
31. A focus on truth promotes external regulation, whereas a focus on<br>
<p>
functionality promotes individual responsibility. This is because truth<br>
<p>
is by defintion absolute and authoritarian where as functionality is<br>
<p>
grounded in the emotions, need and desire, and thus in motivation,<br>
<p>
intention, and volition. This makes function more useful than truth both<br>
<p>
in libertarianism and pancritical rationalization.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
32. Again, a focus on functionality leads to a desire for greater<br>
<p>
emotive control. Another example of where it would be beneficial<br>
<p>
[useful] for scientists to gain greater control over their emotions is<br>
<p>
when the government and other instituitions cut funding to them. Instead<br>
<p>
of "squealing" they might speak with emotive passion and charisma.<br>
<p>
Instead of waisting hours, perhaps days and weeks, being pissed off,<br>
<p>
they might be using that time *usefully* working on an appeal or seeking<br>
<p>
funding elsewhere. Also, it is better to argue that your research should<br>
<p>
be funded because of its function rather than your research should be<br>
<p>
funded because it is seeking truth. The government does not want your<br>
<p>
*ideal* truth. It wants something that functions [particularly something<br>
<p>
that functions destructively].<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
33. Though the person focused on truth can rationalize violence as<br>
<p>
irrational, that person is more likely to be violent and to participate<br>
<p>
in the creation of violent technology because that person does not have<br>
<p>
the same control over his/her emotions as the person focused on<br>
<p>
usefulness. A kleptomaniac might come to the realization that what he is<br>
<p>
doing is *wrong* and that he would like to stop, but in that same<br>
<p>
instance he steals something because he has not delved into his<br>
<p>
subconscious in order to truly take responsibility for his emotive<br>
<p>
drives. He may have the cognitive and rational skill to realize his<br>
<p>
problem, but not the emotive capacity to truly deal with it. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
34. Based on the same argument in 33, a person who holds truth as a<br>
<p>
higher priority than usefulness is more likely to be a Charlaten,<br>
<p>
saying/thinking/rationalizaing one thing while feeling and doing yet<br>
<p>
another. Severing emotion from cognition severs the individual.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
35. When people seek truth they seek answers from the other. Thus those<br>
<p>
seeking truth are much more likely to conform to the beliefs of others.<br>
<p>
A person who seeks functionality is not going to be concerned with the<br>
<p>
supposed truth of others. The person who seeks functionality is going to<br>
<p>
question everything and determine for themself what is most functional. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
36. The concept of functionality is more consistent with the concept of<br>
<p>
a theory than truth is. A theory lasts until a more functional theory<br>
<p>
comes along, not until a more true theory comes along. Theories serve a<br>
<p>
function, a need or desire. They do not serve a truth. Theories predict<br>
<p>
functioning phenomena and events, they do not predict truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
37. With functionality we can get rid of refuting. Instead of attempting<br>
<p>
to *prove* something right or wrong, we criticize the usefulness of<br>
<p>
something and attempt to create something more useful. Criticism is not<br>
<p>
useful without an alternative. Refuting does not require an alternative<br>
<p>
where as functionality does. Occam's razor compounds the reason to make<br>
<p>
this shift. [Note: the criterion for criticism is not truth yet rather<br>
<p>
usefulness.]<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
This list continues to grow and refine. The distinctions are subtle, but<br>
<p>
the shift will have monumental effect.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that you are following the postmodernists into a blind</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; alley. Let me put it this way: if I put a stick in the ground, then</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; things have an objective distance from it.  My placing of the stick may</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; have been 'arbitrary' in some sense, but the distances are not.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The *actual* distance is not arbitrary, but the name we give it is. The<br>
<p>
concept of inches is an arbitrary convention. The concept of meters is<br>
<p>
an arbitrary convention. The are ways we have chosen to break larger<br>
<p>
things up into smaller things. The way in which we differentiate the<br>
<p>
organs or systems in a body is an arbitrary convention. We say we have<br>
<p>
the circulatory system, the digestive system, etcetera. These are<br>
<p>
arbitrary distinctions. They are not as distinct as the naming implies.<br>
<p>
Either system could just as usefully be said to be part of the other<br>
<p>
because neither would work without the other. Or we might choose to<br>
<p>
define smaller arbitrary systems. This helps us understand complex<br>
<p>
systems and events better.<br>
