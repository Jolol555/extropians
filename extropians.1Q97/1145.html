On the topic of women and achievement ( or genius) : for an interesting  look<br>
at women and men and why and how they attain their accomplishments, I suggest<br>
renting the movie Camille Claudel, a sculptress who was certainly more<br>
"gifted" - and certainly worked hard  as Rodin (even coughed up some blood -<br>
just to please LYLE) but became known only as his mistress, despite the fact<br>
that he stole a lot of her ideas and techniques - he was a better business<br>
man and better at running his life. And he had a wife to do his laundry and<br>
make his house for him.<br>
 ; )<br>
<p>
(IMO the main difference between men and women and WORK is that women WILL<br>
sacrifice their career or can, and men won't or can't - whos fault is that?<br>
Let's try this discrepancy from an socio- economics standpoint if we want to<br>
get to the bottom of it, maybe that will yield some statistics we can work<br>
with)<br>
 <br>
BTW, she ended up in an asylum (not at all extropic this movie, BTW for those<br>
of you who want to stay positive at all times) and shunned by the art<br>
critics, after he dumped her.<br>
<p>
Her work lives on, brilliant as ever....<br>
<p>
This is not to imply that it was Rodin who was responsible, nor men, but the<br>
continued victim status that women choose to accept. IMHO.<br>
They have a saying ... there are no victims, only volunteers( after the first<br>
time anyway).<br>
