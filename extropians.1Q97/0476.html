You might want to consider that large brains are *very* costly, in metabolic<br>
expenses, the cost of getting those larger heads born, and the much higher<br>
parental cost of caring for babies in a longer development cycle made<br>
necessary by the brain size/pelvic size problem.  Hominid brain size<br>
increased by four fold during the ice ages, and evolution does not increase<br>
the size of a costly item without it having a fully compensating advantage. <br>
Or to put it another way, evolution found large brains in humans to be very<br>
valuable indeed. <br>
<p>
William Calvin extensively explores the idea in Ascent of Mind (on the web)<br>
that brains expanded to provide more accurate throwing.  I.e., humans came to<br>
occupy a projectile hunter niche and needed the brain volume to hit things. <br>
Up against the ice, part of the year it was hunt successfully or the whole<br>
tribe died.  Read it, Calvin provides the most organized ideas in this area I<br>
know about. <br>
