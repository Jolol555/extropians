I agree with it, but it doesn't make cryonics or uploading pointless. <br>
First of all, his ontology could be wrong (happens all the time). <br>
Secondly, if you start seriously believing there is a perfect world where<br>
you live a perfect life, what is to stop you from simply killing yourself<br>
(there is even one such world where you kill yourself only to awaken in<br>
your personal paradise!)? Just as Moravec previously claimed that hurting <br>
simulated beings was bad not because it changed the amount of suffering <br>
in the Manifold (they would get hurt anyway) but because it would change <br>
you to a worse person, I would say avoiding uploading because you would <br>
get it somewhere would change you to a worse person. <br>
<p>
I really hope he will not go the same way as Tipler and Penrose, seduced <br>
by his personal philosophy. Sometimes I'm glad I keep to the sane and <br>
practical areas of neuroscience... ;-)<br>
