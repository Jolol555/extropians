The recent discussions about libertarian/anarcho-capitalist political <br>
philosophy and the supposed benefits and flaws which would be found in <br>
societies operating purely under those principles points out a crucial <br>
missing element - real world experience.  In other words, all of this is <br>
pure speculation until such a society actually forms and provides an <br>
example of whether or not such a society society actually works.<br>
<p>
To my knowledge there are several projects underway which would attempt <br>
to create such societies:<br>
<p>
1. The Atlantis Project (<a href="http://www.oceania.org">http://www.oceania.org</a>) aims to create an <br>
island.  As far as I can tell, this one just kinda mysteriously stopped <br>
about 2 years ago.<br>
<p>
2. The Laissez Faire City (<a href="http://www.lfcity.com/">http://www.lfcity.com/</a>) project takes a <br>
different tack, and is planning to obtain a 100-year lease of a parcel of <br>
land from some host country.  I assume they've done their homework and <br>
are confident that such a property could be run/operated independently <br>
from the host country.  They also claim to have established an "interim <br>
community" in Costa Rica which allows members to live tax free.  All of <br>
which sounds interesting, but I have a gut-level suspicion of any group <br>
that asks me to pay $35 for additional "research materials."<br>
<p>
3. The Millenial Project (<a href="http://www.millennial.org">http://www.millennial.org</a>), has a comprehensive <br>
plan for "colonizing the galaxy in 8 easy steps."  One of the beginning <br>
stages involves building ocean colonies.  In addition, the members of one <br>
of their chapters are currently planning a land-based colony to research <br>
the social and environmental aspects of living together in a group <br>
(<a href="http://www.neca.com/~dimitri/lbc.html">http://www.neca.com/~dimitri/lbc.html</a>).  While the folks at TMP are not <br>
explicitly libertarian, from what I've seen they lean towards strong <br>
protection of individual rights for their colonists.<br>
<p>
And these are just the ones I know about which focus on Earth-based <br>
colonies.<br>
<p>
I'm interested in getting additional feedback from the members of this <br>
list:<br>
<p>
Do you know of other similar projects?<br>
<p>
Do you feel that you can achieve personal freedom within the confines of <br>
current government structures, or would you only feel truly free living <br>
in a libertarian society?<br>
<p>
Do you feel that a libertarian society can be realized by working within <br>
the political system to change existing governments, or do you feel that <br>
such a society can only be realized by starting fresh from scratch?<br>
<p>
Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a <br>
libertarian colony?<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance.  Hope this helps to turn our discussions towards the <br>
more practical aspects of libertarianism.<br>
