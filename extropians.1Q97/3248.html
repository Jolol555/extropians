In a message dated 97-03-05 13:26:52 EST, you write:   <br>
   <br>
&lt;&lt; The latency period seems to differ with different sub-types of the virus,<br>
of   <br>
 which there are at least six. &gt;&gt;   <br>
 <br>
This seems likely.  There are many so called "slow viruses" with long latency<br>
periods not just HIV-1. The _Manual of Clinical Microbiology_ (MCM) lists<br>
several p.189, 813, 1027-1032 5th edition 1991;  Kuru, Scrapie; B. Sigurfsson<br>
long incubation period agents (1954).  Other long latency microorganisms are<br>
_Coccidioides immitis_, _Aspergillus_, TB and MAC.  So HIV-1 is not so<br>
strange as far as latency period.  I would even call it uninteresting from<br>
that aspect.  My theory is that we will find many more long latency viruses.<br>
In fact, I am surprised we have not found MORE such as a human cancer virus<br>
similar to Roux Sarcoma cancer virus (also a retrovirus like HIV-1).     <br>
  <br>
HIV-2 is almost genetically identical to HIV-1 (see MCM p. 1013) and causes<br>
AIDS-like disease in African monkeys.   <br>
 <br>
The HIV skeptics don't like the data showing HIV is so identical to animal<br>
AIDS because Koch's postulates are proven easier than with human HIV.  Even<br>
though Koch's postulates have been satisfied by retrospective investigations<br>
of accidental infections with HIV such as the dental cases and hemophilia<br>
cases (to say nothing of the millions of homosexual male infections).   About<br>
200 skeptics are still not satisfied vs.about 35,000 ASM members who are so<br>
far convinced that Koch's postulated are satisfied. <br>
 <br>
It would be interesting to determine if these seemingly minor genetic<br>
differences change latency period prior to AIDS -like symptoms.  <br>
