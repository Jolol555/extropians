<i>&gt; You will not accept the reasonableness of Bayesian inference for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose of a discussion on another topic, unless someone here will</i><br>
<i>&gt; summarize for you the vast literature on the normative arguments for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bayesian inference, and solve the problem in induction to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfaction in the process?  Come now, your behavior here seems a</i><br>
<i>&gt; good example of the error of refusing to give any weight to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinions of others, unless they present to you, at your convenience</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in a form you can quickly understand, all the evidence behind</i><br>
<i>&gt; their opinions.</i><br>
<p>
I /do/ accept that such inference is "reasonable" in many circumstances,<br>
and that opinions of others can be valuable.  I simply refuse to evade<br>
or deny those cases where they fail miserably, and therefore cannot<br>
elevate such methods to a general principle.  They are good tricks,<br>
and I use them where appropriate, but I judge where they are appropriate<br>
by other means.  And I am familiar with some of the literature here, so<br>
I don't expect you to cite every book.  I'm just trying to get you to<br>
see beyond the books--to see for yourself that it is /necessary/ to go<br>
beyond the opinions of others.<br>
