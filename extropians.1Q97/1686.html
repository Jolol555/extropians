<i>&gt;Extropians!  I have lurked on the Extropian list and then took a hiatus</i><br>
<i>&gt;and am back lurking again.  I am just coming off a SAVE THE WORLD</i><br>
<i>&gt;mailing list devoted to the works of Daniel Quinn who wrote ISHMAEL,</i><br>
<i>&gt;STORY OF B etc.  Daniel Quinn has a theory that the human race went</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong about 10,000 years ago when it turned to totalitarian agriculture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Totalitarian agriculture eliminates all biological competitors in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;production of human food.  Now Quinn views the Salvationist religions</i><br>
<i>&gt;which developed out of this agricultural revolution as being a major</i><br>
<i>&gt;part of the ecological crisis.  He sees humanity overpopulating the</i><br>
<i>&gt;earth and destroying the biological community of which it is a part and</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot exist without.  He talks about the Great Forgetting of 3 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;years of human existence living in tribes on this planet.  Daniel Quinn</i><br>
<i>&gt;wants humanity to have a new mythology to enact which would allow the</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological community to continue to evolve and exist.  It is not clear</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me if the Extropians have this perception of an ecological crisis or</i><br>
<i>&gt;the view that man must exist within a biological community. </i><br>
<p>
Humans make many changes to Earth that threaten my survival.<br>
Assuming by biological community you mean carbon based life forms,<br>
 I hope I am not limited by that.<br>
I do not like limitations.<br>
Man must exist as man does.<br>
Who says man must remain man?<br>
I would rather be better than man.<br>
How about you?<br>
<p>
 In<br>
<i>&gt;INFO-PSYCHOLOGY Dr. Timothy Leary wrote that "Ecology is the seductive</i><br>
<i>&gt;dinosaur science that will lead most of the post-human species to</i><br>
<i>&gt;conform to terrestrial conditions, become reasonably comfortable,</i><br>
<i>&gt;passive, robot-conditioned cyborg innsectoids directed by centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt;broadcasting systems. "  He goes on talking about adapting to a cyborg</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence.  Elsewhere, Tim Leary wrote that planet Earth is not suitable</i><br>
<i>&gt;for an ever expanding technological civilization and Industry must</i><br>
<i>&gt;migrate to the asteroids and other planets citing G. Harry Stine's book</i><br>
<i>&gt;THE THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.  Daniel Quinn views this outmigration</i><br>
<i>&gt;of humans as sorcery,</i><br>
<p>
Sorcery: a good word to use if you want mundanes to hate some thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;thinking that humans cannot exist outside of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;biological community.  The current Industrial Society is rapidly</i><br>
<i>&gt;changing the face of the Earth.  I just got a report from a friend in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Germany on how the Autobahn is adding additional lanes and in his words</i><br>
<i>&gt;"das ganze Land wird zur Strasse"  the whole countryside is being paved</i><br>
<i>&gt;over with highways.  Hearing the refrain from Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow</i><br>
<i>&gt;Taxi song " They paved paradise and put up a parking lot,  you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;know what you got till it's gone, took all the trees and put them in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;tree musuem, and charged all the people a dollar and a half just to see</i><br>
<i>&gt;them".  That song seems more and more relevant.  Putting all my Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;exposure and voracious reading together gives me an information overload</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is hard to deal with.  The Extropians seem to me to be like the</i><br>
<i>&gt;futuristic intellectual province envisioned in Hermann Hesse's GLASS</i><br>
<i>&gt;BEAD GAME of the 24th century.     Lurker   Ed Maciocha</i><br>
