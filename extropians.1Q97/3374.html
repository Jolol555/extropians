I am interested in silicon dioxide, actually. Your comments on silicon and<br>
its glass like texture makes sense.  Yet, the use of abrasive solid hard<br>
surface structures for protective devices, like an armor, has a visual<br>
element that I like. <br>
<p>
More appropriately, I like the combination of multiple textures for<br>
skin-like protective membranes. I envision textures that will change color<br>
and design. The environments we will be spending time in will also influence<br>
what textures will be appropriate.  And, the time frame is important: how<br>
far into bio-tech beings we are.  <br>
<p>
This is a topic where scientific suggestions could be insightful. What<br>
suggestions do other have for mid-transhuman to late-transhuman stages?<br>
