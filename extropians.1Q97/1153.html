Seen any perpetual motion machines lately? Or are they all locked up in<br>
that big warehouse with the Ark of the Covenant, the captured alien<br>
saucers and the 200mpg carburettor? <br>

Here's another one: 'they' always said that we couldn't travel faster than<br>
sound. <br>
<p>
And guess what... all those claims were true in a limited engineering<br>
sense (there were problems that would be hard to solve), but contradicted<br>
the laws of physics as they were known at the time. Rockets could<br>
obviously work in a vacuum if supplied with oxidiser, heavier than air<br>
flight simply required light enough materials, and bullets had been<br>
travelling faster than sound for decades; in fact, the V2 had done so in<br>
WWII, though that was probably classified. As absolute claims they were<br>
simply wrong, and any reasonable physicist could have shown why. <br>

There is nothing impossible about wiping out life on Earth from the moon. <br>
You just build yourself some kind of total conversion generator (you can<br>
do that with a black hole, right?) to convert lunar soil into energy and<br>
use that to launch millions of thousand ton rocks towards the Earth at 50<br>
km/s. <br>
<p>
What is impossible is doing so in the kind of small-scale scenarios that<br>
we've been talking about, because it contravenes fundamental laws of<br>
physics such as conservation of energy. None of the predictions that<br>
people always bring up to defend such claims contravene these laws. <br>
