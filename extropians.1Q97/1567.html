The satellite people ARE working on it.<br>
<p>
Global internet access via satellite uplink will soon be available.  It will<br>
allow a person to setup high-speed internet links from anywhere on the globe<br>
via a space-borne backbone.<br>
<p>
I am not allowed to say much more about it at this time, but I am the person<br>
responsible for writing the routing/switching/scheduling software that will<br>
allow this happen.  The system is dynamic, adaptable, and very slick.  You<br>
will be hearing more about this in the near future...<br>
