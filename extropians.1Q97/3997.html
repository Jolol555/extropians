Yes, but in a sense both would be wrong, because 'A' doesn't mean the same <br>
thing anymore.  Both are now faced with major problems.  ( Which one of<br>
us is married?  Or does my spouse like polygamy?  Who goes to work on<br>
Monday, and who pays the income tax on it?  These are only a few )<br>
<p>
Being A is now so different from what being A was before that it would<br>
probably have been less of a change than becoming person C with no duplicate.<br>

<i>&gt; to your right. I have 3 questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) How could you determine if you were the "original" (whatever that means) </i><br>
<i>&gt;    or the "copy"?</i><br>
<p>
Physical placement.  Are you standing on the red square marked 'source'<br>
or the one labeled 'destination'?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Why should you even care?</i><br>
<p>
Unless some governing body made some applicable law, you probably<br>
shouldn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) If you somehow found out that you were the copy, what if anything would </i><br>
<i>&gt;    you do?</i><br>
<p>
Attempt to confuse all observers as soon as possible about who is who,<br>
and lie vigorously.  This assumes that it is relevant ( as in #2 ) and <br>
further assumes that there is an advantage in being the original.<br>
<p>
In the absence of #2-type laws it seems best to attempt to negotiate an <br>
immediate non-competition agreement with your duplicate, because he<br>
has the same potential problems that you do.  If seems also useful<br>
( if one's concience permits ) to conspire to commit some profitable<br>
crimes, because of the new alibi possibilities.<br>
