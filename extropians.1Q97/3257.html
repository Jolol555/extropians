In a message dated 97-03-06 18:47:37 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; introverted growing up, and did not begin to be <br>
 sociable till Junior year of high school, and had a big stage fright <br>
 problem up until I started my lighting business in Seattle in 1991. <br>
 Doing presentations repeatedly got me out of it. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
I had the same experience.  Now I give virtually any public speaking<br>
presentation without much, if any, second thought.  One of the reasons is<br>
that I know my subjects much better than I did as a child.  Also because I<br>
know everything is a theory and subject to interpretation.  So, when I know<br>
someone will be disagreeing with me in the lecture, I don't take it so<br>
personally and know that my theory is at least as good as the opposing<br>
theory.   Other people will sort the theories all out for themselves. <br>
<p>
I don't even mind if I change my mind later and agree with the opponents.  I<br>
just change my next lecture accordingly and introduce the new information.<br>
