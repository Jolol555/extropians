&lt;I feel quite suspicious about all these statistics. They do not take <br>

My personal quality of life increased immeasurably in the last <br>
several<br>
years, with the development of the Internet, and my understanding of <br>
it.<br>
<p>
I have yet to see an indicator of progress that would take it into <br>
account.&gt;<br>
<p>
You are correct, of course, about the statistics measuring "quantity <br>
of resources spent" rather than "quality of the results".  I work at <br>
producing the Consumer Price Index and the CPI has been much in the <br>
news lately for allegedly overstating inflation and failing to account <br>
for many quality improvements.<br>
<p>
The problem, of course, is that we measure what it is easiest to <br>
measure and not necessarily what is it useful to measure.<br>
<p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (for which I work, and for which I am <br>
not speaking in this post) admits that the CPI can only approximate a <br>
Cost-of-Living Index.  And even if we could achieve a true COLI it <br>
would still not represent what Nina Munk, in Sep 14, 1992 Forbes <br>
magazine article, called a "convenience-of-living index".<br>
<p>
And even then, there is still the issue of what is important to *your* <br>
quality of life vs. someone else's.<br>
There is an excellent cartoon about these issues at<br>
<a href="http://www.salon1999.com/comics/comics1961216.html">http://www.salon1999.com/comics/comics1961216.html</a><br>
(by a guy called 'Tom Tomorrow' BTW!) where a guy who looks like Fred <br>
Mertz from "I Love Lucy" says to his wife: "Well Martha, the bad news <br>
is we can't afford to heat the house this winter -- but by God, if we <br>
ever scrape up enough for a computer it'll have more processing power <br>
than you ever dreamed possible."<br>
<p>
Right now I'm heavily involved in trying to update the samples of <br>
goods and services that are used to produce the CPI.  We're trying to <br>
bring in such things as online services and cellular phones for the <br>
first time.  However, these things change so fast that it's extremely <br>
difficult to get a good sample.<br>
<p>
MORE INTERESTING though, is your implied desire for a *personal* <br>
quality of living index.  Someday I'm hoping we get to the point where <br>
you could subscribe to your own 'personal COLI' where you'd indicate <br>
your geographic and demographic characteristics and, especially, which <br>
categories of goods and services are most important for your own <br>
needs, and the system would construct and weight a cost-of-living <br>
index tailored specifically for you.  Hmmm, maybe when I get tired of <br>
working for the government I'll see if I can construct such a <br>
system...<br>
