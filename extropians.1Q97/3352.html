This post of mine didn't make it to the list last tiome I sent it:<br>
<p>
Sitting on my ass waiting for the bus at the busstop on my way back from<br>
college today I pondered the question of how we're going to integrate the<br>
new technology of interactivity and three dimensional graphics such as<br>
virtual reality with movies to create a new medium. Radio and Movies merged<br>
to create broadcast telivision. How will movies evolve? So I conceived the<br>
idea of "Theme Worlds". In a theme world you can select what role you wish<br>
to play in the world. The world will have a limit to the number of people<br>
who can be in there with you or extra people will be extras (probably just<br>
browsing and passing through). There will be a small group of people<br>
(usually referred to as the main characters of a movie). You will be able<br>
to choose to play the role of one of these characters in the Theme World.<br>
Multiple sessions of these theme worlds will be running and you would<br>
select which character you would like to play the role of from a screen<br>
showing profiles and statistics of each of the characters (aka avatars) and<br>
upon selection, the program would dump you in the open slot in one of the<br>
many sessions. There will be no fixed plotline or if there is one it will<br>
gently nudge you along with obstacles or spontaneous orders where if one<br>
character is playing his/her role, all others must follow in sequence or<br>
else their avatars die or something because of the way the world is setup<br>
or such to keep the action 'pace' (thanks Regina) going and preventing<br>
boredom. Theme Worlds could be set in different universes, on different<br>
planets, or in different periods of history. Each character would have<br>
different skills, powers, whatever so you could experience these people's<br>
virtual lives through their eyes. Have you ever wished you were a character<br>
in a movie? Perhaps when you were a child? Ever wish you could see the<br>
world in a book or movie through the hero or heroine's eyes? If this is the<br>
future of entertainment then I predict it will be more real than we have<br>
ever experienced. Has anyone written a book on this concept cause if not, I<br>
will! I'm just overloaded with inspiration on this one right now! Damn how<br>
can I write to Wired!!!<br>
