I assume you don't want to debate this point. You said the same thing before,<br>
I responded at some length explaining exactly why you were wrong, you said<br>
nothing.         <br>

<p>
And maybe LTP has nothing to do with memory, and maybe Penrose is right, and<br>
maybe the Pope is right, and maybe pigs will fly. We can play the "maybe"<br>
game all day long, but in all of that only one thing is new, the most popular,<br>
most detailed, most highly developed, theory that explains how the brain<br>
stores memories has been shown to have a much smaller storage capacity than<br>
was thought before January 28 1994. Call me crazy if you want but I think<br>
that is a rather significant development.<br>

<i>                &gt;RAM doesn't map well to Turing tape.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you mean it's not practical then what you say is true, but absolutely<br>
nothing about A Turing Machine is practical, it is after all not a real<br>
machine but a mathematical construction that helps us understand things.<br>
<p>
If you mean that RAM should be put in a special category because Turing<br>
Machines have extra trouble with it, then what you say is nonsense. A Turing<br>
Machine with two tapes and two heads is provably equivalent to a solitary one<br>
with one tape and one head, in fact it's equivalent to any Turing Machine with<br>
a finite number of heads and a finite number of tapes, it's also equivalent to<br>
a machine that uses a 2 dimensional plane instead of a tape, it's equivalent<br>
to a random access Turing Machine.<br>
<p>
Incredibly even a Non-Deterministic Turing Machine is equivalent to a<br>
regular run of the mill single tape single head Turing Machine, although it<br>
would be enormously faster, that is, it would be faster provided that what<br>
everybody thinks but can not prove really is true, that P is not equal to NP.<br>
