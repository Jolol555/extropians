<i>&gt; I mean, the same chemicals that composed the "primordial soup" from which</i><br>
<i>&gt; life arose on this planet, and perhaps elsewhere, would probably still be</i><br>
<i>&gt; around today whether life arose or not. WHAT "SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE" IS THERE</i><br>
<i>&gt; FOR THE CHEMICALS TO FORM INCREASINGLY COMPLEX PATTERNS? </i><br>
<p>
The reason why the genome _can_ become more complex would just be that<br>
DNA is a polymer, and can get longer and longer. Probably there's an<br>
upper limit to the length of a single chromosome, but you can add new<br>
chromosomes. Mechanisms of length-increase probably involve insertion<br>
or retention of multiple copies of DNA; e.g. extra copies of chromosomes<br>
are made at replication, or perhaps mRNA is spliced back into the genome<br>
somewhere by reverse transcriptase.<br>
<p>
One reason bigger genomes could be advantageous: by allowing for more<br>
adaptable organisms.  The more useful add-ons an organism has, the more <br>
adaptable it is liable to be, but each add-on will require extra genes. <br>
A ceiling on genome length is probably a ceiling on adaptability (until<br>
brains get into the picture).<br>
