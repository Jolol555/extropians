Out of context, the above statement, made by myself, is certainly<br>
contradictory and inadequate. In context I do not believe that was the<br>
case. Agreed, it was not articulated well, but I was pointing out that<br>
when we define something, making ourselves aware of that things limits,<br>
we can then question those limits. In that sense, "Definitions DO NOT<br>
LIMIT things", yet make it possible to transcend the current limits of<br>
things. The refusal to define things more often limits things, because<br>
we are refusing to become consciously aware of the existing limits, and<br>
thus we are unable to question those limits. <br>
<p>
I was trying to point out, that even though a person may not consciously<br>
articulate their definition of art, they still have a subconscious<br>
definition of art. The definition exists. It is only a matter of wether<br>
that person wishes to articulate and question it or not. A person<br>
recognizes art by their definition of art, and if a person claims to<br>
have no definition for art, yet is still capable of recognizing art,<br>
then that person is simply unaware of their subconscious definition ...<br>
for art. <br>
<p>
With that I'm done with the "definition" thread. I think it is now<br>
fairly agreed that definitions of art have value.<br>
<p>
My apologies for making your head spin Tom, though vertigo is one of my<br>
particularly favorite sensations.<br>

Explore and play!<br>
