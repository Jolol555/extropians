I recently read  *Evolving the Mind:  on the nature of matter and the <br>
origin of consciousness*  by Graham Cairns-Smith.  His thesis is that <br>
we are assuming too quickly that consciousness *cannot* be material.  <br>
We need to expand our understanding of what matter is, and then it <br>
may turn out that "material consciousness" isn't an oxymoron after all.  <br>
Those of you who have read his earlier books, be warned:  this one is <br>
different.  He doesn't present a theory of the origin of consciousness, <br>
like his theory of the origin of life.  In this book he is just speculating, <br>
probing, trying to decide what is the right question to ask.  It might <br>
have been better if he had waited a few years before publishing this <br>
book.  However, my purpose here is not to review the book.   <br>
<p>
He makes a provocative remark in the first chapter.  First he quotes <br>
Faraday, as follows:  <br>
<p>
MF:  Thus, for instance, the weight or gravitation of a body depends <br>
MF:  upon a force which we call attraction; and this force is not <br>
MF:  something away or separate from the matter nor the matter <br>
MF:  separate from the force; the force is an essential property or part <br>
MF:  of the matter, and, to speak absurdly, the matter without the force <br>
MF:  would not be matter.  Or, if we recognize matter by its hardness, <br>
MF:  what do we other than recognize by our sensations a force <br>
MF:  exerted by it?  <br>
<p>
Then he comments:  <br>
<p>
CS:  Although today we cannot but believe in atoms, none of us are <br>
CS:  atomists any more, not in the Greek tradition.  Newton had <br>
CS:  helped the trend away from the clear-cut atoms of Democritus, <br>
CS:  Lucretius and Descartes:  he supposed that there were forces <br>
CS:  operating at at distance between atoms by analogy with the <br>
CS:  huge gravitational forces which seemed manifestly to operate <br>
CS:  across millions of miles of space.  Since Newton we can no longer <br>
CS:  insist that anything has a clear location.  Where is the moon?  <br>
CS:  Out there a quarter of a million miles away?  Well you might say <br>
CS:  that most of it is out there, but what sense is there in saying <br>
CS:  that the moon is in one place but has an influence here <br>
CS:  in raising the tides twice a day, because, oh yes, it has an attached <br>
CS:  gravitational field.  (How is it attached -- with stitching?) <br>
CS:  Is is not better to say, as Faraday did, that material things consist <br>
CS:  of fields, more intense in some places, less so in others?  <br>
<p>
We all start out with a basic ontology, i.e. an (implicit) theory of <br>
what kinds of things there are.  As children, we have a vague idea of <br>
what an entity is, and how entities affect each other.  Our basic <br>
ontology is partly neurological -- our brains are wired in such a way <br>
that we perceive objects with boundaries -- and partly cultural -- we <br>
absorb certain ideas about entities and causes from the first language <br>
we learn.  <br>
<p>
Progress is made in science when men like Newton and Faraday refine <br>
their ontology, i.e. come up with a more fine-grained idea of what an <br>
entity is.  The moon isn't that thing we see in the sky; that's part of it, <br>
you might say that's the center of it, but it is "here" as much as "there," <br>
and we have to expand our idea of what an entity is so that this concept <br>
makes sense to us.  <br>
<p>
Since extropians are less concerned with making progress in science <br>
than with increasing their own intelligence, we can express this <br>
in a more subjective way:  we increase our intelligence by refining our <br>
ontology.  When we have a more fine-grained understanding of <br>
what an entity is, what space is, what causality is -- then we are more <br>
intelligent.  <br>
<p>
In other words, *speed* of thought has very little to do with it.  <br>
If you speed up somebody's thought processes but leave his ontology <br>
the same, he will just miss the point a hundred times faster.  <br>
