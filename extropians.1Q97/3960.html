The artist formerly known as FutureNerd reported<br>
:		(A friend (in the mid-80's) said he made some puns in<br>
: French to some French people and they were astonished--they don't *do*<br>
: puns. ...)<br>
<p>
Did they say why not?  Are they afraid of being mistaken for Walloons?<br>
(I've got a stack of comicbooks out of Brussels that are about as punny<br>
as I can take without barfing.)<br>
