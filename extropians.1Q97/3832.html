<i>&gt; While he may be literally correct, the fact is that until our country</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed its USPTO, investment in technological advancement was an</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely high risk proposition. This is why the only technologies that</i><br>
<i>&gt; remained secure were those that were classified SECRET by governments,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and enforced with death sentences. Unfortunately, this method tended to</i><br>
<i>&gt; stifle cross fertilization as well as the possibility of mass producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; secret inventions, since by their secrecy their market was limited.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Those that did not remain secure were easily stolen and copied.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Inventors never got rich on their own, they always had some rich</i><br>
<i>&gt; politician or industrialist as their lord protector who made the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; money off of it since they had the goons to enforce their self declared</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights.</i><br>
<p>
That language is so full of holes and connotations I find it hard to<br>
pin down what it means.  If I could, I might be able to argue, but one<br>
has to find meaning before one can discuss it.  If you can give me some<br>
examples of what you're talking about, I might better understand.<br>
<p>
You also use words like "secure" and "stolen" which are begging the<br>
question posed, namely, are ideas property, and is copying ideas theft?<br>
Secondly, you act as if the rich patron of the creator is not entitled<br>
to return on investment, and the greater share of options his wealth<br>
provides.  In a pre-capitalist aristocracy, that might have been true.<br>
But I am arguing for capitalist institutions, where wealth is earned by<br>
labor, creation, /and investment/, not by currying favor with the guns.<br>
Where the creator must convince his patrons what his creativity is worth,<br>
and the patrons can decide how to profit from their own investment in it,<br>
and both are rewarded in proportion to what they can freely negotiate,<br>
and both hire the same goons to enforce their voluntary contracts. <br>
<p>
If a contract between two free men cannot be enforced, then society is<br>
already so far gone that it is not worth saving.  That is the very<br>
foundation of civilation, without which there is only rule by force.<br>
I am assuming that in all my discussions, because if that most precious<br>
piece of freedom is lost, nothing else can be argued until that is fixed.<br>
If you want to argue that contracts are not valid, then our minds have<br>
no common ground, and we must stop.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With our current system, inventors have at least a better than even</i><br>
<i>&gt; chance of getting paid fairly for their creations, even of enforcing</i><br>
<i>&gt; their rights overseas. LDC seems to have gotten to his opinons by being</i><br>
<i>&gt; disgusted with the high cost of comercially available software, but if</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property rights were fully enforced, software could be sold</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the price of a paperback. The reason this isn't so is that its much</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier to copy electronic data than printed bound material, so its much</i><br>
<i>&gt; harder to enforce copyrights with software than books.</i><br>
<p>
Again you assign me motives with no evidence and no basis in reality.<br>
I don't give a damn what software costs, and I've never said anything<br>
to make you or anyone else think that.  Please argue with what I say,<br>
not with what your fertile imagination dreams up about me.  I "got my<br>
opinions" by reasoning from the evidence available to me /on both<br>
sides/, and from my experience as a producer.  I'm sure your experience<br>
is different; perhaps you've spent more time on the inside of the<br>
present system, so you are blinded by it.  I am not. <br>
<p>
In our present system, creators use the means available to them to<br>
earn money--but that's not evidence of the system's value for many<br>
reasons: (1) The fact that they use the system as it is says nothing<br>
about how it might compare to a different one, or how creators would<br>
use that different system. (2) The earnings of a creator today are not<br>
necessarily what one would expect from a different system.  They seem<br>
"fair" precisely because they are what we are used to, and we act in<br>
ways to make them come out that way under the present system.  Again,<br>
this says absolutely nothing about how it /might/ be.  (3) The system<br>
also has very real costs to both the creator and to everyone else,<br>
that I have outlined many times, and those cost changes would change<br>
the net earnings of a creator.  (4) The cost of enforcement is high,<br>
and will only get higher with more networking and technology.  Yet<br>
another cost factor.  (5) Your failure to imagine how the information<br>
economy might operate in the absence of copyright is no justification<br>
for assuming it would fail to operate just fine.  I have shown many<br>
ways such a system might function; if you care to argue against any of<br>
those, please do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The more widespread intellectual property enforcement occurs, the lower</i><br>
<i>&gt; per unit intellectual property costs will be for consumers, so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices will more closely reflect a "fair" market value...</i><br>
<p>
This is naked assertion, and utterly without evidence.  In fact, it is<br>
quite opposite of plain logic: enforcements cost money, copying is cheap.<br>
When the information itself is a negligible cost, consumers will pay<br>
for things like workmanship, timeliness, customization, organization,<br>
etc.  Some of those things will be provided by creators, some by others,<br>
but in a free market, they will tend to be produced by those who can<br>
produce them most cheaply.  When the information itself is an enforced<br>
monopoly, its subsidiary products will be produced by those whom the<br>
creator has chosen for his own reasons, not the consumers'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry, this means that you are an anarchist rather than a libertarian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is SOME need for government. What form it is and how it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; administered are different issues entirely.</i><br>
<p>
You say that like it's a bad thing. :-).  Yes, of course I'm an anarchist.<br>
I absolutely deny the "necessity" of monopoly government in any human<br>
society, and live with hope for the day when it will be wiped from the<br>
face of the planet.  I know that's a minority opinion, even among die-<br>
hard libertarians, but I simply have not seen any convincing argument for<br>
the absolute necessity of that arbitrary institution, and I have seen<br>
more than I care to of its crimes against humanity.  Until I am shown<br>
with clear, convincing, evidence that anarcho-capitalism /cannot/ work, I<br>
will continue to treat government as a criminal enterprise, and those who<br>
support it have no sympathy from me.<br>
