In a message dated 97-01-26 17:30:53 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 This, about the best friend I ever had...<br>
 and now I'm the one who is <br>
 "abusive"... what perfect female logic.  <br>
<p>
  Lyle I am so sorry, i had no idea you were being for real - you often make<br>
up things, and try to be obnoxious on purpose, so i was certain you were<br>
fabricating the whole thing - the cry wolf i guess.. i feel awful.<br>
<p>
Again, I am terribly sorry - if i had known it was a real scenario, I would<br>
have been more sensitive. It is a terrible thing to lode a loved one.... <br>
I feel like a jerk.<br>
You had just made up the AI thing - taunted everyone, and I thought you were<br>
just pulling everyones chain again...<br>
<p>
I deeply regret any abusive meaning, it wasnt my intent. <br>
 <br>
