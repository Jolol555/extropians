<i>&gt;Well, yes, it is ubiquitous.  For starters, a large percentage of the US</i><br>
<i>&gt;population believes the Bible is *literally* true, including such patently</i><br>
<i>&gt;ridiculous ideas as the world being created only 6,000 years ago.  </i><br>
<p>
This is your best example.  Here one is tempted to postulate broken <br>
cognitive processes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Most people think that a die is less likely to come up 6 if it has</i><br>
<i>&gt;come up 6's the last 3 times.  Many people think that the Social</i><br>
<i>&gt;Security Trust fund is significant when compared with Social</i><br>
<i>&gt;Security's debt.  Most people think that when they buy a house they're</i><br>
<i>&gt;"building equity", when in reality 98% of what they pay goes to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bank.  Most people believe that the greatest danger to their children</i><br>
<i>&gt;is posed by strangers (when children are molested, kidnapped or</i><br>
<i>&gt;killed, it's almost always friends or family).  I could go on forever</i><br>
<i>&gt;like this.</i><br>
<p>
These are cases where the public thinks one thing, and experts think<br>
another.  Here it is not clear that the public knows of the expert's<br>
opinion.  Without that, it is not an example of the phenomena at issue.<br>
