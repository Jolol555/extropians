<i>&gt; &gt; The comment to which I replied was something along the lines of "in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 100 years, you wouldn't recognize English", and I disagree...</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here's an interesting idea:  Automatic translation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; --- BEGIN EPIGRAM ---</i><br>
<i>&gt; "When making a prediction based on a technological trend, ask yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; what technology could lead to the exact opposite of what you predicted. </i><br>
<i>&gt; If that technology could move faster than the trend on which your</i><br>
<i>&gt; prediction is based, rethink your prophecy."</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	-- Eliezer S. Yudkowsky (sentience@pobox.com)</i><br>
<p>
A brilliant observation, and one I will save and keep in mind when<br>
I attempt further prophecies.  Thank you.<br>
<p>
But I don't think it applies here.  Two facts get in the way: first,<br>
in order for two automatic translators to communicate effectively,<br>
they will need to share /some/ common protocol for representing the<br>
concepts they plan to exchange.  The more universal this internal<br>
protocol is, the more useful the machines will be, so there is a<br>
drive for stability.  Second, since much of the information content<br>
of something like a movie or television show is not expressed in<br>
the mere language used, such recordings will have to be archived in<br>
their original, complete form, so that transhumans who study these<br>
fossils will be able to see the tones, facial inflections, music,<br>
lighting--and cultural idiom--contained in them.  To deliberately<br>
abandon English rather than keeping it alive along with whatever<br>
native transhuman communication we develop would be to smash the<br>
Rosetta stone, limiting our ability to learn from the past.<br>
