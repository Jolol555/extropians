&lt;&lt;   When I see someone upset by a statement, it is usually<br>
 a simple, straightforward statement of fact or opinion.  A talk<br>
 show host in SF recently said on the air "I believe the ethics of<br>
 Jesus to be morally superior to the ethics of Judaism."  Jews<br>
 everywhere were indignant, and demanded apologies or reprimands.<br>
 Why?  They had no cause to take offense.  He believed that, he<br>
 stated why he believed it.  I as an atheist took no offense, I<br>
 merely disagree.  He behaved entirely appropriately as a talk show<br>
 host by expressi &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
IMO this illustrates David's point most eloquently, rather than negating it. <br>
I also mayhave "no respect for those who complained" - but that is not the<br>
point. <br>
They do not get your respect, so what? They probably are too angry to care by<br>
the time you are to that point. A rational debate is pointless.<br>
<p>
While I agree with you: it is not onjective to get offended at such things,<br>
it is common knowledge that in this world, there are "touchy areas" and that<br>
certain words will push certain buttons in certain individuals.<br>
 As Mr. Musick asserts, it depends on your goals, and if you wish to open<br>
dialogue with people of different backgrounds, in order to get across (say,<br>
your objectivist ideas for example) it is often wise to know before hand<br>
which buttons you are pushing. To ignore these " buttons", and use words<br>
which push them as if they that they exist is worse than to do it<br>
deliberately, but they both have the same effect - alienating your audience.<br>
<p>
 To reiterate: Yes, it is easier to hold a dialogue with rational thinkers<br>
who do not react emotionally to ideas. But they alrady have your same<br>
leanings, we are talking about communicating your ideas to others you may<br>
wish to sway.... <br>
<p>
In our society there are MANY  "hot buttons" (religious, political,  racial,<br>
expletive, etc) which are commonly recognized as "baiting" for an emotional<br>
response. In order to best communiate your most valid ideas to the largest<br>
number of people, it may be wise to learn to use these *only when your<br>
desired effect is anger*. <br>
<p>
To blatantly push these buttons and then act indignant when others react -<br>
seems to me an act of _passivity_, counterproductive to good relations with<br>
others, ( and *most important* in debate), not optimal for spreading your<br>
memes.<br>
