<i>&gt; I think you misjudge sensor technology.  Military IR sensor satellites in</i><br>

<p>
The question would be, how large an area are they scanning at any time? A<br>
one degree temperature difference over a ten meter square should give you<br>
maybe 500W at the surface. So that would imply that those satellites could<br>
detect my warhead at about the same distance. <br>
<p>
So if they're scanning the whole sky at once and still getting that<br>
resolution, then that's a problem, but if they're only scanning a few<br>
square kilometers at a time then it will take them a significant amount of<br>
time to spot the warheads and they'll be unable to track more than one;<br>
Even radar would work if you already knew where the warhead was to within<br>
a few kilometers. Imaging something you already know the location of is<br>
much, much easier than finding something in trillions of cubic kilometers<br>
of space. <br>

*If* they know roughly where it is.<br>

<i>&gt; EMP. </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I don't know what would happen either. However, all that energy<br>
would have to go somewhere, and it would probably end up in heat. Even if<br>
that didn't happen, having gigavolts running unexpectedly through the<br>
control hardware would be annoying, to say the least. <br>
