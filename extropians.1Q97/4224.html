Those little bug buggers have a lot to answer for.  First sex, then<br>
genocide.  I wondered idly one day if<br>
the horror of  single-generation mass deaths by infection caused by<br>
bacteria and viruses introduced into long-isolated places such as Australia<br>
and various islands is not the time-compressed equivalent of a very<br>
stretched-out Great Dying in other places.  Leaving aside the matter of<br>
bugs evolving commensal forms - but even then, what is mild in populations<br>
exposed to bugs from birth is hideously lethal otherwise.  Fences (and<br>
rivers and oceans) might make good neighbours, but the better they are the<br>
more of your kids die in the long run.  (This fact, BTW, presumably<br>
falsifies Hoyle &amp; Wickramasinghe's bugs-from-space theory.)<br>
