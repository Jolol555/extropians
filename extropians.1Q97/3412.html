<i>&gt;  Was Darwin's theory that man evolved from simpler organisms "proper</i><br>
<i>&gt; science"? Can you measure the statistical significance of its outcomes?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, absolutely.  If it weren't, he'd be just another popular author<br>
selling meaningless gobbledegook like _Fourth Turning_.<br>
<p>
Evolution made specific, measurable, experimentally falsifiable<br>
explanations and quantitative predicitons; and those explanations<br>
have not been falsified (despite many lame attempts by creationists<br>
and other nutcases) and many predictions came through.<br>
<p>
Predictions were things like parallel evolution of similar life<br>
forms on separate continents; measureable phenomena are things like<br>
the simple fact that for every fossil in the record, there appears<br>
a similar but not identical fossil in earlier records; the fact that<br>
mathematical models of the time scales necessary for evolution do<br>
not conflict with the time scales actually measured.  The fact that<br>
mathematical models with conditions similar to life do in fact<br>
cause the same effect ("genetic algorithms").  The fact that matching<br>
DNA sequences between species, especially organelle DNA, shows<br>
common ancestry.<br>
<p>
And the most important, measurable, quanitifiable statistic imaginable:<br>
Of the millions of species of life on Earth ever studied, /not one/<br>
has ever been found that is not explainable by evolution.  Put one of<br>
your social theories to that test: if you postulate that some age<br>
was "the age of heroes" or some such nonsense, show me that /everyone/<br>
on the planet at that time fit some definable profile.<br>
