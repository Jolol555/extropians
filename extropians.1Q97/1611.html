You asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you (consciously) developing Minsky's "Jokes and the Cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unconscious" (which is a development of Freud's ideas on jokes and</i><br>
<i>&gt;"censors")?</i><br>
<p>
Not consciously; perhaps not at all.  I'm vaguely familar with Freud's take<br>
on humor, but do not recall having heard Minsky's.  My slow, intermitent read<br>
of THE SOCIETY OF MIND continues.   Is it in there?  If not, I'd very much<br>
like to hear the basics.<br>
<p>
My own theory about humor remains admittedly incomplete.  As Anders pointed<br>
out, it does seem to have the capacity for reinforcing memes, by association<br>
with the pleasure of glee.  Wanting good examples, however, I remain<br>
skeptical that humor can deliver memes (as opposed to anti-memes) themselves.<br>
