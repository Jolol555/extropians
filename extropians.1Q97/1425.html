ever heared of 'dog-bears' ? (that means no dogs and no bears in this<br>

John, you don't seem very perceptive of the examples we've presented you<br>
with. So far you have come up with none yourself in defense, just theory. <br>
<p>
I fully agree that early hominids don't live up to the 'fierce hunter' image<br>
that has always been projected on them, but turning it completely around<br>
seems more than a little unreasonable as well.   <br>
<p>
I'm also open to aquatic ape theory, it's the main alternative theory, and<br>
therefore the main source of critical analasys of hominids early history.<br>
It's a shame AAT-ers seem to be just as stuck in their dogmas as established<br>
science.<br>
 <br>
I had to go back on my words several times in this discussion, and i had no<br>
problems with that. I had hoped you would come up with new angles/<br>
alternatives for looking at the examples some of us have presented you with.<br>
Instead you just repeat your words, ignoring our examples as incidental<br>
exceptions.<br>
<p>
I can go on repeating my words as well, or look for more similar examples,<br>
but something tells me you're going to ignore them just the same, so i won't.<br>
