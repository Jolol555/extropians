        The same holds true for this thread.  There need not be any<br>
definition for art, nor for that matter, any definition for a definition of<br>
art.  Anyone can get something out of a piece of art, just as anyone can get<br>
something out of a puffy white cloud floating across the periwinkle<br>
perimeter of the sky; just as anyone can get something out of an inkblot.<br>
It is really quite a simple concept.  There are no rights or wrongs to<br>
someone's kosher interpretation...unless it is paired with the artist's<br>
intent.  Just because "The Tyger" is written by a religious man (Blake)<br>
supposedly about religious things, I have seen the poem in a much different<br>
way.  Once paired with the artist's intent, my interpretation appears<br>
incorrect, though I myself find it to stand true.  We are all artists, and<br>
we are all art critics.  We need no orthodoxy or protocol or boxed<br>
definitions to quell the freedom of interpretation.  Love things because<br>
*you* love them, not because it is your duty to love them.  Cradle each<br>
piece of art like it is your own offspring...for it is.  But most of all,<br>
listen to what it has to say to you, for it has a voice, but it speaks<br>
different words to each who want to hear it.<br>
