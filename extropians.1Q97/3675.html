<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Art is a discourse, and the creators of Extropic Art act as a voice for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Extropianism;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are many extropian voices:</i><br>
<p>
Indeed there are. But (again) my point is that not all observers of<br>
Extropian Art will have heard these voices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;indeed, they may define Extropianism. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I disagree.  I have never heard of a philosophy, a movement, or a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;religion that has been defined by its artists or by their artwork.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropic Artists act as a voice for their own individual extropic</i><br>
<i>&gt;creativity. (Extropy has been defined by Max More.)</i><br>
<p>
OK, again. _I_ know Max has defined Extropy, _you_ know Max has defined<br>
Extropy, _everyone on this list_ knows Max has defined Extropy. Potential<br>
observers of Extropic art do not know that. Why should they?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If I created art-work</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;showing graphic and cruel vivisection, called myself an Extropian artist</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and displayed all over Britain</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You would not be an Extropic Artist unless the work was produced to provoke</i><br>
<i>&gt;an extropic view of such vivisection. </i><br>
<p>
_I_ know that: the observer may not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are many people who make false claims about who they are, from art to</i><br>
<i>&gt;politics to science. </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps my example was bad as it suggested a deliberate attempt to subvert<br>
Extropianism from a position of knowing its actual tenets. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;A piece of artwork cannot challenge generic 'assumptions'. It can only</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;challenge the particular assumptions of its audience. Very few people have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;any assumptions at all about Extropianism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is not accurate.</i><br>
<p>
What isn't? If you mean the very few people, I think it is, regrettably,<br>
and through no fault of anybody. Simply try expressing the number of people<br>
who are aware of Extropianism as a percentage of 5 billion. Then do the<br>
same with Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Michael Jackson, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;so artwork has the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;create, rather than challenge, any assumptions about Extropy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;According to the defection of Extropic Art, the art is extropic.  Basic.</i><br>
<p>
I think this agrees with what I'm saying, but I don't really understand the<br>
point you're making here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Another</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;example: if I paint a series of pictures showing Max wearing flowing robes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in front of a cross,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think Max would buy it -:)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;may not see the imagery, but that's my point exactly.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And, thus, a reason for words.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This point is interesting, but doesn't hold because extropianism is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt;stand-alone.  One venue does not have a monopoly on extropian ideas. Nor</i><br>
<i>&gt;will it.  Simultaneously, books are written about extropy, articles about</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropy and extropians appear in widely read magazines and newspapers, BBC</i><br>
<i>&gt;and PBS films appear on TV with extropians, films with extropians,  poems</i><br>
<i>&gt;about extropy, plays, conferences, technologies, ways of thinking, and so</i><br>
<i>&gt;forth. </i><br>
<p>
I agree with you entirely, and my entire argument is based on the viewing<br>
of Extropian Art by people who have no other source (or few sources) of<br>
information. That's why I'm suprised my original post has provoked such a<br>
large response: it didn't seem such a controversial thing to say.<br>
