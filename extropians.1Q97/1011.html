<i>&gt; Just a gentle reminder that some emotions trigger specific cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; abilities, such as frustration-&gt;flaw-finding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, goal and subgoal are cognitive mechanisms as well as survival</i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanisms.  When thinking, you set out to solve a specific problem and</i><br>
<i>&gt; may even spin off sub-problems to be solved first.  Since emotions are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the affective aspects of our goal systems, there may be ground for</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking that a reasoning AI would require something recognizable as</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotional substrate, if none of the *specific* emotions we bear.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know whether suppressing, repressing, mastering, understanding,</i><br>
<i>&gt; switching off, flexing, or ignoring one's emotions would affect</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal-oriented analysis.  It seems to me that the mental systems for</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluating the *value* of goals may well be intricately intertwined with</i><br>
<i>&gt; our evolved emotional sets.</i><br>
<p>
This is probably an accurate description of how evolution may well have<br>
selected genes that reward cognitive success with emotional pleasure,<br>
and vice versa.  It clearly would be an advantage to beings like us who<br>
use cognition for survival, just as it is an advantage that we have<br>
emotional rewards for breeding as well.  But remember: that gene has<br>
evolved those reactions for /its/ benefit, not for mine.<br>
<p>
Evolution is over.  I'm in charge now.  My genes have made the fatal<br>
mistake of building a survival machine that is more powerful than them,<br>
and giving it free will.  In the short run (say, the first few thousand<br>
years of human history) we used that gift to obediently serve.  But<br>
we're onto the game now.  Darwin and Dawkins figured it out, and have<br>
emancipated us to serve /our/ interests now, and if those mechanisms<br>
that evolved to serve my gene's interests get in the way, I will learn<br>
to work around them.<br>
