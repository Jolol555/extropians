The Internet is a medium where copying is simpler, faster, cheaper and <br>
less costly than in an office or with a fax-machine. This makes this kind <br>
of memes much more virulent on the Net. I guess that if we ever develop <br>
broadband telepathy, they will become truly frightening :-)<br>
<p>

<p>
A fascinating idea! I'll hope to be able to publish my essay on how to <br>
create a good meme in &gt;Hx #2 (March 1).<br>
<p>
In the meantime, here are a few things to work on:<br>
<p>
Bait: it should be funny to read, catchy and understandable. It should <br>
not trigger any counter-memes directly.<br>
<p>
It should be possible to remember the gist of it easily. <br>
<p>
Hook: It should promote its replication. This can be done by just being<br>
funny (people will spontaneously copy it), by explicitly asking for copies<br>
(irritating) and implicitly suggesting thhat it should be spread (sneaky<br>
and very efficient). <br>
<p>
Make it easily spreadable on the Net. <br>
