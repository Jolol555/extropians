<i>&gt; On of the things that has NOT come up at all about cloning yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; (everyone is being very pragmatic and clinical)  is how we will REACT</i><br>
<i>&gt; to seeing our own DNA as a child, or all grown up and walking around. </i><br>
<p>
Why would we expect anything different or unusual?  We already know how<br>
parents treat children, and how identical twins treat each other, so I<br>
would expect to treat my clone in some combination of those ways.  I<br>
think it would be more likely to expect parental behavior, because even<br>
though he's actually my twin brother rather than my son, all of the<br>
sensory input he gives me will be child-like, not twin-like.  I have no<br>
reason to have evolved any emotional reactions to clones, but I have<br>
very definitely evolved reactions to my children--i.e., little creatures<br>
that look like me (this one more than usual) and that depend on me.<br>
<p>
Having first said that cloning would be "uninteresting", I must now<br>
concede that the medical uses will be numerous.  But I maintain that<br>
there really is no social issue at all.  A child is a child is a child.<br>
Your first sentence states the problem right off: you refer to "seeing<br>
yourself".  It's /not/ yourself, it's a kid.  A completely ordinary,<br>
crying, spitting, diaper-filling kid.  And from the first moment after<br>
conception when hormone levels in the womb in which his zygote develops<br>
are different from those of the womb in which I developed--even if we<br>
go to the extreme measure of using my mother as the surrogate--his<br>
development diverges from mine, and never looks back.<br>
<p>
I'd like to think that my little brother wouldn't develop into a<br>
serial killer, or that we might share some interests or values, but<br>
all I can probably count on is that he'll be tall, fair-skinned, bald,<br>
and have green eyes.  Beyond that, I'll probably hate the music he<br>
listens to just as much as my father hated mine.<br>
