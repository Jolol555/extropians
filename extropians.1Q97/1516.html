Here's something I think you'll all enjoy.....<br>
<p>
An Indian chief had three wives, each of whom was pregnant. The first =<br>
gave<br>
birth to a boy. The chief was so elated he built her a teepee made of =<br>
deer<br>
hide. A few days later, the second gave birth, also to a boy. The<br>
chief was very happy. He built her a teepee made of antelope hide. The =<br>
third<br>
wife gave birth a few days later, but the chief kept the details a =<br>
secret.  He<br>
built this one a two story teepee, made out of a hippopotamus<br>
hide. He challenged the tribe to guess what had occurred. Many tried,<br>
unsuccessfully. Finally, one young brave declared that the third wife =<br>
had given<br>
birth to twin boys. "Correct," said the chief. "How did you figure it =<br>
out?" The<br>
warrior answered, "It's elementary. The value of the squaw<br>
of the hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws of the other two<br>
hides."<br>
