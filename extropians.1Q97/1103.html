Good point Katheryn.  I am also a model, as well as having been contestant<br>
in beauty contests in high school and college. And the latter, from my<br>
memory bank, is about looking good, walking nicely, and maintaining an<br>
alluring quality.  (Ho hum)<br>
<p>
The humor of this piece was not poking fun at pretty ladies. The humor<br>
referenced immortality and the view that one cannot achieve what one don't<br>
already have:  one cannot live forever if one isn't living forever. =20<br>
<p>
Now, I agree with Lyle's interpretation:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would not live forever, because we shouldn't live forever. =20</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Why shouldn't we?  Because --]  If we were supposed to=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; live forever, then we would, but in fact we can't.  Therefore=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; we aren't supposed to. =20</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Conclusion]  That's why I wouldn't live forever. =20</i><br>
<p>
However, "should" and "supposed to" are not references that I feel<br>
comfortable with because *who* should and *who* supposes.  This line of<br>
thinking keeps us stagnant and accepting a prescribed fate, rather than<br>
working towards changing or creating our fate.<br>
<p>
And, further:<br>

Dan Fabulich:<br>

<p>
And, again Katheryn:<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;reasoning that preceded it.</i><br>
<p>
On another point, I'm not sure that any one discipline purports more<br>
geniuses than another, although science certainly rates quite high. In the<br>
art world the term "genius" is bandied around right and left, and with good<br>
reason.  Just listen to the academy awards, or a hisory books or biographies<br>
about Picasso, Manet, Monet, Rembrant, da Vinci, Lizst, Stravinsky, Hans,<br>
Mozart, Glass, Brahms, Wagner, Gertrude Stein, Dante Alighieri, Brando,<br>
Meryl Streep, Woody Allen, Man Ray, Vincent Van Gogh, Camilla, Salvadore<br>
Dali, Ayn Rand, Michelangelo, Georgia O'Keefe, Cleopatra, Lucille Ball,<br>
Martha Grahm, Charlie Chapin, Kurosawa ... this is just to name a few.<br>
<p>
There have been many striking and articulate posts which analyse the genius<br>
issue "Re: Genius and Y chromosomes" this month on this list.  Are we=<br>
 rehashing?<br>
