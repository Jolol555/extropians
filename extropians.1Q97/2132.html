From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; From this, we can see that it becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to communicate at faster than light speeds. Using a reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; light source, at point C, individuals at points A and B can communicate</i><br>
<i>&gt; by using devices that only have a 50% chance of receiving a photon at</i><br>
<i>&gt; any given moment. Like the classic cat experiment, by using binary 1s</i><br>
<i>&gt; and 0s to selectively observe and not observe the reference source of</i><br>
<i>&gt; photons, we selectively collapse and fail to collapse the wave function.</i><br>
<p>
No, you can't communicate using such a device!  This is the original<br>
EPR paradox, and as has been discussed here recently, Bell's work does<br>
imply that something strange is going on here.  But there are no results<br>
that I am aware of in standard QM which would allow communication via<br>
the faster-than-light connections which are often invoked to explain<br>
the results.<br>
