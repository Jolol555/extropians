<i>&gt; &gt; English is the greatest language the planet has ever seen because it's not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; efficent! English constantly evolves a such a rapid pace that if you time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; traveled 100 years from now, you wouldn't understand a word of it and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; though it is one of the hardest languages to learn, it allows for the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; flexibility and creativity. Fuck the rules! I say... Forget Ebonics. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hail English!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (1) The sample set of human languages is so small, and the evaluation</i><br>
<i>&gt; period so short, that I don't think one can draw any conclusions from</i><br>
<i>&gt; its present dominance.  It just happened to be the language that was</i><br>
<i>&gt; used my the world's major imperial power, and later by the world's</i><br>
<i>&gt; leader in technology.  To evaluate language as a technology itself, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it makes more sense to look at earlier cultures where it had more</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious influence.  Chinese comes out the winner there, and for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; good reasons, especially the writing system.  It is far more efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; than alphabetic systems: more words per page, fewer penstrokes per word,</i><br>
<i>&gt; faster to read and comprehend.</i><br>
<p>
WHile Chinese has a higher idea density per page than most others, the<br>
demands on the memory are daunting, and departs from the present trend<br>
away from so much memorization toward developing practiced thinking<br>
skills. Coming from a Chinese background definitely guves one a leg up<br>
on metal fitness due to this, but moving from that background toward a<br>
better creative language allows the mind to really race once freed from<br>
the load.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (2) Evolution of the language has been rapid, but is clearly slowing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Today's students may have difficulty with Shakespeare and downright</i><br>
<i>&gt; consternation with Chaucer, but in 2030--even 2130--a 1930 recording of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a Rudee Valee tune will sound as ordinary as it does today.  Spelling</i><br>
<i>&gt; and vocabulary stabilized shortly after the printing press; phonology</i><br>
<i>&gt; is stabilizing now, after the advent of sound recording, radio, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; television.  Sure, there will always be some growth, but not as rapid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Oh please Lee, comparing the present comprehensibility of 400-700+ year<br>
old works of literature to  a 100 or less year future's possible<br>
comprehension of present literature (though I would hardly call Rudee<br>
Valee literature) is stacking the deck and not a good comparison. Try<br>
instead Thoreau's _Walden_ in an ordinary high school class 50 years<br>
from now (or even try it right now, you will find blank stares of<br>
incomprehension from 99% of them). Bringing up this point proves you<br>
wrong...<br>
<p>
Look at the EC's plans to "normalize" English spelling. Should this<br>
happen, you will find a similar gap as is seen between us and Shakespear<br>
(there were a few spelling reforms in the 1600s- 1700s). Rather you whos<br>
that english is evolving at an accellerated rate. Just look at all the<br>
terms coined in relation to the internet alone. The faster technology<br>
evolves, so will the language used to communicate it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (3) The vast, detailed, expressive vocabulary of English is indeed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; good thing, and works well for expressing fine distinctions that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be difficult in other languages (only French and German come close),</i><br>
<i>&gt; but it also encourages ambiguity: words created or borrowed to express</i><br>
<i>&gt; some narrow, specific idea are often diluted into more general meanings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Replica", for example, once meant "a reproduction of an artifact by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the original artisan".  Now it swims in the same soup as "copy" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "duplicate"--it has even migrated into the territory of "model".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; English has served us adequately, but we can do much better.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular, we can try to fix the well-known identifiable problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; like sexism, unintentional ambiguity, poor adaptability to new</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts, cultural dependencies, and others.  Whatever we create</i><br>
<i>&gt; will no doubt evolve other problems--but we'll never find our way</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of the maze until we free ourselves from the straitjacket first.</i><br>
<p>
And these sort of "reforms" will further evolve the language. I do think<br>
that the cyber elites that start uploading will evolve english and code<br>
into an ideographic language that will allow for greater efficiency as<br>
people's mental capacities are enhanced by technologies, because we will<br>
have to compete will a Chinese superpower in the 21st century with  a<br>
billion people who can already think that way....<br>
