<i>&gt; When we're discussing the nature of political possibility, I think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; population economists would think of is not the dozens or hundreds of</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly educated or popular people, but the millions and billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who have had their little inputs into society.  When, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example, you advocate anarchist solutions, you are saying that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; societies, for all of human history, have been making the same mistake</i><br>
<i>&gt; of having government.  That's a very strong claim.  Can you pit your</i><br>
<i>&gt; logic and experience against the thought and experience of billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I can.  Reality is not a matter of consensus.  It exists the way it<br>
does regardless of what 5 billion people think.  If one man has a clearer<br>
vision of some facet of it, and he can demonstrate it, the masses have<br>
no choice but to abandon their mistaken consensus, or it is they who are<br>
irrational.  The existence of governments is a powerful consensus, and<br>
it is hard to fight, because it is hard to do controlled empirical<br>
research on the hearts of the multitude.  But it is not impossible to<br>
observe and draw some reasonable conclusions, and to attack some bad<br>
ideas and revisionist history.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And once you have, can you convince those people that you're not nuts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; begin with?</i><br>
<p>
That's not easy sometimes, because the definition of "nuts" is usually<br>
by consensus rather than objective criteria.  But it is necessary to try.<br>
