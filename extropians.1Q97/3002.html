Early last fall there was some discussion about replacing 'Spontaneous <br>
Order' in BEST DO IT SO with 'Self Ownership'.  If I recall, <br>
Spontaneous Order was disliked because it was a term from biology that <br>
seemed too submissive to whatever 'blind' evolution threw at us and <br>
Self Ownership was preferred because it was more 'libertarian' or <br>
suggestive of individual responsibility and creativity.<br>
<p>
I was looking at Stuart Kauffman's _At Home In the Universe_ the other <br>
day and noticed that the older term Spontaneous Order had been pretty <br>
much replaced by the newer term 'Self Organization'.  It's clearly <br>
more extropic to use 'self' rather than 'spontaneous' because that <br>
emphasizes the agent rather than the environment.  Self Organization <br>
seems like a nice compromise to me because 'organization' seems to <br>
imply a combination of both the other two concepts: external order and <br>
intrinsic ownership, along with the ability to chart one's own course <br>
between the two.<br>
