<i> &gt;Now.  The question is - will you assign meaning based on "what you</i><br>
<i> &gt;want", which is a fancy way of saying you'll let evolution do it for</i><br>
<i> &gt;you?  Or will you assign meaning based on a genuinely true chain of</i><br>
<i> &gt;logic?  In short, will you reason it out or accept the dictates of your</i><br>
<i> &gt;genes?</i><br>
<p>
Eliezer, it's quite foolish to pretend that determinism means that our <br>
behavior is determined by our genes. If you had been born with precisely<br>
your present genes, and immediately put up for adoption and raised in <br>
Korea, you would be quite a different person than you are now.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;And saying "Yes, it has value, to me" is simply ducking the point.  You</i><br>
<i> &gt;say it has value?  Well, I can take apart your brain right down to the</i><br>
<i> &gt;level of individual atoms and demonstrate that you assigned it value</i><br>
<i> &gt;simply because it tickled your pleasure centers.  And I am not</i><br>
<i> &gt;impressed.  If I build a computer programmed to spew out:  "Cats have</i><br>
<i> &gt;value to me", fundamentally, nothing happens.  So what?</i><br>
<p>
It's a little bit sad that you can't tell the difference between a human<br>
being and a 386 programmed to spew out random sentences.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I simply deny that value is an observer-dependent thing.</i><br>
<p>
Assertions prove nothing, Eliezer. How would you like to go about<br>
demonstrating to us the arguments behind your conviction that value<br>
is independent of valuers? If this is your axiom, then you are<br>
simply assuming what it is that you are setting out to prove: that<br>
life has no value.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;You can have,</i><br>
<i> &gt;in memory, a declarative statement that "X has value".  So what?  A</i><br>
<i> &gt;CD-ROM can do the same thing with a lot less fuss.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps it's the extra fuss that makes the difference? A simple<br>
computer can declare "I will resist if you turn me off." You turn<br>
it off and nothing happens. I, on the other hand, can declare "I<br>
will resist if you try to take away my raincoat." and you will find<br>
it a considerably harder task to take away my raincoat than to turn<br>
off the simple computer.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;My position is that we can't alter the Platonic structure of the</i><br>
<i> &gt;Universe through wishful thinking.  We can't make things have value just</i><br>
<i> &gt;by declaring they do.  Our declaration that "X has value" will cause us</i><br>
<i> &gt;to act in such a way as to maximize X.</i><br>
<p>
No, it is the fact that we value X that causes both of the above.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Are you going to tell me that "value" is defined with respect to a</i><br>
<i> &gt;particular individual, and equals whatever that person acts to</i><br>
<i> &gt;maximize?  That 74 degrees is the Meaning of Life for a thermostat? </i><br>
<i> &gt;Well, I am jumping out of the system.  I'm saying that to *me*, acting</i><br>
<i> &gt;to maximize X *has* *no* *value*.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, so you're a nihilist who can't tell the difference between human<br>
beings and themostats. This is hardly a new philosophy. People have been<br>
messing around with nihilism extensively for the last hundred years, and<br>
it goes back even farther than that. But nihilism is not really a<br>
philosophy; nihilism is a disorder of the affects.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;You see, you are arguing for a Meaning of Life, just a silly one. </i><br>
<i> &gt;You're saying that the Meaning of Life is a certain sort of behavior,</i><br>
<i> &gt;acting to maximize things.  I don't see how this is any more reasonable</i><br>
<i> &gt;than saying that the Meaning of Life is "cats" or "worshipping God" or</i><br>
<i> &gt;"tuna loaf".  So you're born, you live, you act to maximize something,</i><br>
<i> &gt;and you die.  I see no place for intelligence, consciousness, brains,</i><br>
<i> &gt;neurons, thinking, subjectivity, or really much of anything in this</i><br>
<i> &gt;worldview.</i><br>
<p>
There are many things in the world which cannot be maximized by<br>
anything simpler than intelligence, consciousness, brains, thinking,<br>
etc. There are many things in the world which cannot be maximized<br>
by thermostats.  I'm sorry that you have concluded that none of<br>
them is worth your while, that you are too brilliant and stupendous<br>
a genius to waste your precious time on such niggling projects.<br>
Perhaps you should take a cue from the Zen Buddhists and sit your<br>
butt down on a black cushion and stare at a white wall for forty<br>
minutes every morning. Then, after experiencing that kind of boredom<br>
and that kind of inactivity, perhaps you won't be quite so bored<br>
and disgusted with the rich pageant of Life that is going on all<br>
around you.<br>
<p>
The Meaning of Life is staring you in the face. It's right in front<br>
of your eyes. If you don't feel it right now, get outside. Find a<br>
dandelion meadow or a beautiful man or woman or a symphony orchestra<br>
or something.  Try reading some William Blake, who teaches us how<br>
to see the world in a grain of sand.<br>
<p>
Oh, yeah... by the way... from what values are you arguing? What end is<br>
it that you have in mind when you conduct this argument? Or are you<br>
simply arguing mindlessly, with no particular wish or desire (I find<br>
this hard to imagine). What is it that motivates you to invest so much<br>
effort in constructing arguments of this sort? Of all the questions I've<br>
asked you in this post, these last are the ones I'm most interested in<br>
hearing the answers to.<br>
