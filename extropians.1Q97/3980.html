I think I am who I am.<br>
I do not think I am that other person <br>
who thinks It is who It is.<br>
A=A<br>
B=B<br>
If B=A then there is only A.<br>
There is only one A.<br>
Next in line is B.<br>

<i>&gt;You walk into a matter duplicating chamber, there is a blinding flash of </i><br>
<i>&gt;light, when your eyes clear there is a man who looks just like you standing </i><br>
<i>&gt;to your right. I have 3 questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;1) How could you determine if you were the "original" (whatever that means) </i><br>
<i>&gt;   or the "copy"?  </i><br>
<p>
That would depend on how it was done which seems theoretical.<br>
You just designed the duplicating chamber, you tell me.<br>
If I was standing on one side of the chamber <br>
and I now appeared to be on the other side of the chamber <br>
I would know I was the copy.<br>
<p>
Personally I would not care about the past.<br>
I am who I am.<br>
I does not matter much if I existed a minute ago <br>
unless there is a reason for it to.<br>
Is there?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) Why should you even care?  </i><br>
<p>
I would not care,<br>
except if the methods used were destructive <br>
because I do not want to be destructed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3) If you somehow found out that you were the copy, what if anything would </i><br>
<i>&gt;   you do?</i><br>
<p>
I may say "Thank you very much for copying your self, <br>
I'm glad to be alive"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;They are exposed to different memes. They evolve diferently.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly, as time went on the two would start to diverge.</i><br>
<p>
As one billionth of a nanosecond passed they would have diverged.<br>
Any amount of time no matter how small  is time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;One difference, no matter how small, means they are not the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;Don't drink a cup of coffee, it will change you far more than Quantum  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Uncertainty ever will.</i><br>
<p>
AAAGGGHHH! <br>
NNNOOO! <br>
HELP ME! <br>
MY PARTICLES ARE SPILLING OFF OF ME!<br>
MY LEPTONS, MY LEPTONS!<br>
<p>
:-)<br>
<p>
I regretfully accept these changes <br>
as long as I do not seem to experience pain.<br>
I would rather not be this particularly unstable.<br>
Some day I hope I will solve that problem.<br>
Unfortunatly there does not seem to be much I can do about that right now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Different atoms = different people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then you are quite literally a different person than you were one year ago </i><br>
<i>&gt;because your atoms are different, it doesn't matter.</i><br>
<p>
It does matter.<br>
My matter has changed.<br>
Is there a single molecule that has been with me as long as I have been<br>
(excuse the fact that I have only been for one segment of time)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Atoms have no  </i><br>
<i>&gt;distinguishing marks, no scratches on them to tell them apart. </i><br>
<p>
Location and structure is used to presently distinguish between them.<br>
An atom becomes an isotope and is still that type of atom, only different.<br>
It is like saying all apples are the same from a distance.<br>
If you can tell there are two apples the are obviously not the same apple <br>
as their place in spacetime is effected by different forces <br>
and they are subject to different physical laws,<br>
meaning the actions their particles are participating in are not the same <br>
and thus the are not the same apple. as they are the sum of their particles.<br>
<p>
Mark my words.<br>
We will be more able to distinguish between atoms eventually.<br>
It is written, so mote it be.<br>
I am or at least at some times seem to be <br>
the almost but not quite so semi-omniscient predictionarrationator<br>
of that which has not yet at any particular moment in spacetime <br>
revealed it's self to absolutely every one in the whole of existence <br>
excluding me. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In Science   </i><br>
<i>&gt;you can exchange one atom of Hydrogen with another one and the system does </i><br>
<i>&gt;not change at all.</i><br>
<p>
Of course it changed, you just switched atoms.<br>
Switching is an action.<br>
An action usually requires change.<br>
At one time it had atom A.<br>
At another time it was -A.<br>
At another time it was -A + B.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If atoms themselves have no individuality I don't see how</i><br>
<i>&gt;on earth they could give this interesting property to us.</i><br>
<p>
How many types of sub-atomic particles does it take <br>
to convince you that all atoms are not all the same?<br>
