<i>&gt; Is it rude to put people in my mail filter?  I have 17 extropians in there</i><br>
<i>&gt; so far and the quality of the list just keeps improving!  Tee hee!</i><br>
 <br>
It's certainly not rude to do so, but it's not necessarily a good thing.<br>
I don't want to rehash my old thread on the value of rudeness and the<br>
intellectual pathology of taking offense, but I have to say that he is<br>
absolutely correct that /ideas/ stand on their own merit; to put value<br>
on the originator of ideas is a fundamental mistake of epitemology.<br>
He has expressed some valuable ideas here, albeit in a course manner,<br>
and is likely to express more in the future, and I for one wouldn't<br>
want to miss them.  Even those with whom I have severe disagreements,<br>
like our Mr. de Lyser, are valuable to me, because they give me insight<br>
into the kinds of arguments used in favor of dangerous ideas like<br>
democracy, and help me prepare better arguments against them.<br>
<p>
One should know something about a speaker to better interpret odd use<br>
of language or cultural background, but once ideas are expressed and<br>
understood, they /must not/ be judged by their source, only by their<br>
objective value.  Our esteemed Mr. Carwash has some interesting ideas,<br>
and my mind is not so fragile that I allow his brashness to interfere<br>
with my making use of them.<br>
<p>
My mail program sorts mail from the 25 or so mailing lists I'm on<br>
into separate folders, so when I read mail I read all ExI mail at one<br>
time.  I have not found a kill file necessary or useful for this list,<br>
or indeed for any of the lists to which I subscribe.  The only things<br>
I filter out at all are known unsolicited commercial spam sites, and<br>
those I block at the IP address level, not because of any particular<br>
person's idea, but because the ISP as a whole does not enforce terms<br>
of service that prevent real economic loss for me, so I choose not to<br>
accept any packets from those ISPs.<br>
