Those of you interested in free market solutions should really look at the<br>
Feb. '97 issue of Atlantic Monthly in which the cover article is "The<br>
Capitalist Threat"  written by George Soros, one of the greatest, most<br>
successful capitalists of all time.  <br>
<p>
He says, "Insofar as there is a dominant belief in our society today, it is<br>
a belief in the magic of the marketplace.  The doctrine of laissez-faire<br>
capitalism hold that the common good is best served by the uninhitited<br>
pursuit of self-interrest.  Unless it is tempered by the recognition of a<br>
common interest that ought to take preference over particular interests, our<br>
present system--is liable to break down."<br>
<p>
"By taking the conditions of supply and demand as given and declaring<br>
government intervention the ultimate evel, laissez-faire ideology has<br>
effectively banished income or wealth redistribution....The<br>
laissez-faire-argument relies on the same tacit appeal to perfection as does<br>
communism.  It claims that if redistribution causes inefficiencies and<br>
distortions, the problems can be solved by eliminating redistribution...But<br>
perfection is unattainable.  Wealth does accumulate in the hands of its<br>
owners, and if there is no mechanism for redistribution, the inequities can<br>
become intolerable."<br>
<p>
The problem that I see with the market is that it is concerned only with<br>
money.  People don't buy things, money does.  If you don't have money-- more<br>
than half the people on the planet are outside the global economy--you get<br>
no vote.  You don't count.  You are worse than a non-person, you are a<br>
global liability.  Any system which reduces people to non-entities needs fixing.<br>
