<p>
Of course we can challenge that statement.  Unless "idea" is<br>
broadened so far as to cover all human attributes, there are lots of<br>
(combinations of) attributes that make us each unique.  Taken one by<br>
one, most of the ideas we have are also shared by many other people,<br>
just like our other attributes.  <br>
<p>
I think the difference for you is that you value your ideas more than<br>
your other attributes, so they define you more in your eyes.  And I<br>
share that trait.  But I have sadly learned that most people simply<br>
aren't like this - they define themselves much more in terms of<br>
non-idea attributes.  So most of them just don't see "me", the me I<br>
care about at least. <br>
