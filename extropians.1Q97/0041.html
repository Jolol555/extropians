<i>&gt; As I was considering the way that the United States is trying to restrict </i><br>
<i>&gt; export of cryptographic algorithms, I was thinking about the guy who </i><br>
<i>&gt; distributed PGP anyway, in spite of the laws against doing so.  He got in some </i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble for doing so, but what if he had distributed it over the Internet, </i><br>
<i>&gt; through anonymous remailers, so no one would know who sent it?</i><br>
<p>
He probably could have -- I don't know how secure remailers are --<br>
BUT then he would just be Phil Zimmerman, nobody in particular,<br>
instead of THE Phil Zimmerman, noted security expert and media figure<br>
pursued for interviews, paid speaking engagements, etc.<br>
