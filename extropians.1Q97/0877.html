Not at all. Take a human 100 yards away from a cheetah. A cheetah has a<br>
0-60 time of around 6 seconds. A human has a 0-18 time of around 3<br>
seconds. Assuming the cheetah can keep up the 60 mph once she reaches it<br>
for over two seconds, they cheetah will catch the human at 165 yards, 8<br>
seconds from starting. Give the human an extra 30 yards (a 130 yard<br>
distance) and the human will be over 200 yards before the cheetah can<br>
catch him, by which time the cheetah will be exhausted enough for the<br>
human to brain her a good one. (the human will have run for only 70-80<br>
yards, so will not be winded.)<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You wouldn't need or want to expose yourself in this manner for long periods.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pop up, see what's going on, then hide back down.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, with group behavior, you always want one lookout looking all the<br>
time. Remember, pre-humans were pack animals, not solitary individuals.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;The point is john is that being higher means you can see him</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;when he is too far away to do anything to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; enough to make you nervous then there is nothing you can do, you just better</i><br>
<i>&gt; hope he doesn't see you, otherwise he'll meet (or meat) you for lunch.</i><br>
<p>
Like I just showed, an advance warning of 150-300 yards ensures<br>
protection.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;This is how the meerkats work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Meerkats are not bipedal an so are fast, often faster than the predator. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; never happens with humans because ground sloths are not carnivorous.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
huh, you've never seen meerkats then. They spend a lot of time on two<br>
feet, doing sentry work both on the hunt and around the burrow. I would<br>
say the only thing keeping them from becomeing soly bipedal is the<br>
problems it would incur with their trogloditic habitation, though their<br>
speed is also an advantage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;John:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;Scavenging was probably much more important than hunting</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;at this stage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Michael:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Bull, maybe for the women</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lucy would have been a very poor hunter. She had no tools, she was slow, she</i><br>
<i>&gt; did not have sharp teeth and her claws were a joke. </i><br>
<p>
She also had, as you say, the brain of a chimp. We are talking about the<br>
development of intelligence. So at best, she was the precursor. Also,<br>
chpms are capable of using sticks and rocks as weapons, so dont<br>
disparage the brain. Jane Goodall observed this behavior frequently.<br>
Lucy was also 3 1/2 feet high, so I would only expect her to have a<br>
chimp brain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nobody knows what Lucy's "society" was like, but in modern hunter-gatherers</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the !Kung the woman not only take care of the children they also gather</i><br>
<i>&gt; mongongo nuts, which turns out to be over half of their food supply and is</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more reliable than the hunting the men do.</i><br>
<p>
Just like I said.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;John:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;there were no spears, or tools of any sort at that time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;ancestors  like Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) with</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;their tiny, chimp sized brains were too dumb to make them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;The first very primitive tools were made by Homo  Erectus,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;an animal with a much larger brain than Lucy, although much</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;smaller than modern brains. These very early tools do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;show up in the fossil record until well over a million</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;&gt;years after bipedalism was fully developed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Michael:</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Stone tools did not show up, or haven't been found yet [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;This does not rule out tools made from biodegradable</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;materials. You'd be amazed at how much damage a sharpened</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;bamboo spear can do to an animal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A sharpened bamboo spear would be harder to make than a simple stone tool,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and if you didn't have stone of bone tools to help you, almost impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make. The only reason I can think of for Lucy to work exclusively in wood is</i><br>
<i>&gt; if she wanted to fool future archeologists.</i><br>
<p>
Don't make such statements if you haven't done it yourself. Then again,<br>
maybe your not smart enough to be a prehuman. Looking at how humans<br>
developed their materials technology, they started with the softest and<br>
most malleable materials first. Green wood is extremely malleable, yet<br>
hardens to dangerousness given the proper treatment. A sharp slate piece<br>
can whittle wood very easily. I've done it myself in an outward bound<br>
program.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;or a wooden arrow, like that used by montagnard peoples in</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;SE asia or the Kalahari Bush people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An arrow?! Arrows are High Technology, only a few thousand years old, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; might as well be talking about a LASER guided bombs.</i><br>
<p>
Bows and arrows date to the dawn of recorded history, more than a few<br>
thousand years. The archeological record has had difficulty finding such<br>
weapons due to their ease of degradation. However, your statement is now<br>
completely wrong, thanks to the Tyrolian Ice Man discovered a couple<br>
years ago. He lived in the last ice age, around 15k-20k years ago, and<br>
had guess what? a bow and arrows in his posession! Given this, there is<br>
no reason why bows dont date to even earlier times. Possibly not as far<br>
back as Lucy, but she's more an ape than human. Erectus might have had<br>
the capability.<br>
<p>
 The Kalahari Bush people<br>
<i>&gt; are as smart as you or me, but Lucy was not. Lucy was an ancestor of humans,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however Lucy was not a human, we're talking about an animal with the brain of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a chimp.</i><br>
<p>
If they are, why are they still living in lean-to's?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Three and a half million years ago Lucy was fully bipedal and had a hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost as good as ours, but she was dumb, her brain ranged from 380 to 450 cc,</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern humans have a range of 1000 to well over 2000 cc.</i><br>
<p>
and you fail to mention how tall she was or how much she massed. What is<br>
important is the brain/body mass ratio.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;it funny how dates keep getting pushed farther back all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't noticed. Until some recent finds people thought you had to go back</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10 or 20 million rears to find a ancestor common to both humans and apes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; now they say 5 or 6.</i><br>
<p>
Erectus was originally dated to less than 1.5 mill years. Now hes as far<br>
back as 4-5 million. Sapiens was once thought to go back only<br>
20,000-40,000 years, yet it is now thought to date as far back as 100k<br>
to 150k, maybe even more.<br>
