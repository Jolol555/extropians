It seems that the nature of our disagreement is becoming a bit clearer. <br>
Let's see if this can at least identify where we disagree, and why I <br>
disagree with your definition of free will.<br>
<p>
1. DIFFERING DEFINITIONS:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree that your definition is clear and precise (at least in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; meaning):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks, meaning is what counts. My definition is  "A being has free will if</i><br>
<i>&gt; and only if it can not predict what it will do next".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The problem is that many things (as in a digital slot machine) can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be random (in the broad sense) because of Turing non-predictability,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; while yet being totally deterministic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree and said as much in my post, but I don't see what the "problem" is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least not for me. You say that a determinist universe has no room for what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you call free will, not even with Turing non-predictability, so the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing you have left is events without a cause, that is randomness. Sounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; like a rather poor sort of free will to me, not much worth having.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The classic definition (in my own words) of free will in philosophy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; theology (ackh), and culture at large, is: The ability to select or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to not select an action</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we most certainly have free will, I select things and make decisions a</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousand times a day.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; free from constraints imposed by external circumstances,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Free? The term you're trying to define is FREE will, I fear we're getting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; little circular here. I gave you my definition and it is not circular.</i><br>
<p>
It is not in anyway circular, it only seems circular because I didn't make it<br>
clear that my definition of "free" means (and only means) "acausal".  I know<br>
that you consider this:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; a rather poor sort of free will</i><br>
<p>
but it is my unambiguous definition.  You yourself have accepted this as some-<br>
thing which has meaning in reality, both in your comments on what random may<br>
mean, and in your own statement the other day which said:<br>
<p>
   "I know of no law of logic the demands that every event have a cause."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; or by other agencies (such as divine will) that might impose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; additional constraints not found in the external circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Vague. How do you distinguish between " additional constraints" and "external</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances"? It all seems like exactly the same thing to me, even divine</i><br>
<i>&gt; will is just part of the external circumstances, just part of the problem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be solved. I gave you my definition and it is not vague.</i><br>
<p>
Again this is the same issue.  No vagueness was intended, because by "addi-<br>
tional constraints", I meant ALL constraints that one can semantically define<br>
(as would be consistent with the meaning of acausal).  I had hoped to make   <br>
this clear in the part that followed the one you just quoted where I described<br>
the evolution of philosophical thought on this subject following the rise of<br>
Newtonian science.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; one has free will if they are an acausal agent within some realm</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we have free will, I certainly cause things to happen, but it's too</i><br>
<i>&gt; broad for my taste, my definition is just a subset of that.</i><br>
<p>
A further clarification here.  By "acausal", I mean "acausal" in principle, <br>
not just "functionally acausal" because of Turing-unpredictability.  With<br>
this in mind, your definition can not be viewed as a subset of mine, since:<br>
<p>
1. My definition requires acausality (leaving aside for now any other<br>
   additional things that might also be required such as self-referencing).<br>
<p>
2. Your definition requires self-referencing (which I believe to be ontolog-<br>
   ically undefined) and unpredictability.<br>
<p>
If your definition of unpredictability includes acausality, then our defini-<br>
tions are those of two partially overlapping sets.  If it doesn't (and thus<br>
excludes acausality) then our definitions are totally disjoint sets.<br>
<p>
I agree that the self-referencing will ultimately be important, but I am not<br>
using it at this time because I feel that no ontological basis has yet been<br>
defined for the concept of self-referencing.  I am not nit-picking this issue<br>
just for the fun of it, but because I believe that establishing the onto-<br>
logical basis for self-referencing requires us to penetrate into an area of<br>
the ontologically unknown that we currently perceive as acausal behind which<br>
we may find both a truer form of acausality, and the ontological basis for <br>
self-referencing.<br>
<p>
It is an analyis that I doubt will work if we broaden the meaning of the <br>
free-will to include the Turing style unpredictability, as we would then be<br>
confusing mathematical semanitics with physical causal principles; a problem<br>
that would be analogous to dragging the subject of orbital chaos into a <br>
discussion of the principles of gravitation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not according to my definition. I may be able to predict your behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly (provided I don't tell you what it is) and you can do the same with</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, but we both have free will because we can't predict our own behavior.</i><br>
<p>
The phase "Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist" <br>
is the current operative principle by which MY definition of free will may be<br>
tested against reality.  That it is false by YOUR definition is not any big<br>
suprise as our two definitions quite different.  The statement here is simply<br>
irrelevant to our discussion until we have an agreed upon definition.<br>
<p>
While we're on the subject of the acausal:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or, through some form of trancendent acausality in keeping with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; first meaning, some limited form of free will does exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Trancendent acausality? I have no idea what that means.</i><br>
<p>
Actually it was more redundant than anything, as trancendent causality would<br>
be a form of causality which exists outside of time as we know it.  From <br>
some (but not all) metaphysical viewpoints it is synonomous with acausality.<br>
I should have not used the term since the only time it would not be redundant<br>
would be when it is wrong (especially true considering the fact that I don't<br>
even have a solid opinion on the metaphysical distinction between the two).<br>
<p>
2. REGARDING YOUR DEFINITION OF FREE-WILL:<br>
<p>
2.1. FREE WILL AND TURING:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Either free will does not exist at all, in which case this new</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; definition is wholly wrong because nothing that it called free will,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was in fact such.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to my definition, free will defiantly exists, absolutely no doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it, Turing proved it.</i><br>
<p>
But you definition of free will is based upon the type of inescapable ran-<br>
domness that Turing proved exists (unless it's just simply a self-asserted,<br>
truth) so what could possibly be more circular than to turn around and say<br>
that Turing proved free will as given by this definition?<br>
<p>
2.2. FREE WILL AND COMPLEXITY:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; wondering how much we really know of ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't wonder I know. We know very little about ourselves and will never</i><br>
<i>&gt; know much more, that's why we'll always have free will. Someday we or our</i><br>
<i>&gt; offspring will be far smarter than we are now, but the thing they will try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand, themselves, will be far more complex.</i><br>
<p>
Here you say complexity is what will keep our offspring from losing their <br>
free will in the face of their greater intelligence.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; yet this is what complexity based free-will theory tries to tell us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think complexity theory has anything to do with it and never said it</i><br>
<i>&gt; did.</i><br>
<p>
And, here you say complexity theory has nothing to do with it.<br>
<p>
Not only do I find distinction between the "theory" of complexity that I <br>
mention and the "actuality" of complexity implied by your above statement<br>
to be somewhat of a fine hair to split, but according to M. Mitchell Waldrop <br>
in his book _Complexity_ on page 234, he describes how complexity researcher <br>
Christopher Langton refers to Turing's halting algorithm while explaining<br>
the behavior of class III and class IV cellular automata.<br>
<p>
In point of fact, the type of Turing unpredictability you are talking about<br>
is specifically one of the things that complexity theory studies when it does<br>
this kind of work with cellular automata.<br>
<p>
2.3. FREE WILL AND SOLIPSISM:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; the "actuality" of free will that I'm talking about would (according</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to your above commentary) change strictly as a result of changes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one's knowledge regarding self and/or environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Correct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or worse yet solipsism</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My definition does not demand solipsism, neither does it disprove it, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know of anything else that can do one bit better in that regard.</i><br>
<p>
Here you deny that your definition is in anyway related to solipsism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Consciousness and free will may or may not exist in actuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is one consciousness that I know for sure exists, my own. I can't be as</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain about yours or anybody else.</i><br>
<p>
Yet here you make a statement that could perfectly be described as solipsistic<br>
according to the number one definition of the word in my dictionary.<br>
<p>
2.4. SELF-REFERENCING:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; it leads to local definitions of truth        </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No. I can always predict what I am going to do or I can not, and that is true </i><br>
<i>&gt; hear and there and everywhere.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) I predict that in 2 minutes or less I will be inside my house.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) I find that my key does not work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) My "prediction" was not a prediction at all, it was wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4) I have free will.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, sometimes we can make correct prediction about out behavior, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes we feel like we've fallen into a rut and are turning into robots.</i><br>
<p>
The problem I see here is that statement 4 is just an assertion that could<br>
be made without even bothering with statements 1-3.<br>
<p>
I can see the meaning behind your definition, but since your definition of <br>
free-will is obviously that which a self-referencing entity makes about <br>
itself, it is hard to see how it could ever be wrong.  Equally difficult<br>
to see is how it could ever be useful for anything.<br>
<p>
2.5. GODELIAN INCOMPLETENESS:<br>
<p>
Since the inevitableness of self-referenced Turing unpredictability is really<br>
just another another way of saying that all systems suffer from Godelian <br>
incompleteness with regard to the subject of their own behavior, how can we<br>
turn around and then claim it to be some kind of causal principle by which an<br>
entity would effect its "will" within the world?<br>
<p>
I see two possible answers to this question:<br>
<p>
a. Your definition of free will is so mutant that it no longer even claims to<br>
   be something that represents a causal principle by which an entity would<br>
   effect its "will" within the world, and thus amounts to a tautology that<br>
   expresses nothing more than the Godelian incompleteness of a self-referen-<br>
   cing entity regarding its own behavior.  Tautology definitions:<br>
   <br>
   1: Needless repetition of the same sense in different words.<br>
   2: A logical statement which can never be false.<br>
   <br>
b. Or you really are claiming that Godelian incompleteness is some kind of <br>
   causal principle by which an entity would effect its "will" within the<br>
   world, thus bringing Cartesian dualism back from the grave, in drag.<br>
<p>
3. REDEFINITION OF WORDS:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately your definition is the logical negative of the classic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; definition because when stripped of the self-reference (which I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; get to shortly) it reduces to an operative principle which says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ? Where something is not predictable, then free will does exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is a well established fact in formal logic that the negative of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; logical statement has a different meaning from the original, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; furthermore derives no support as to its validity from the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; statement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please note, I said "if and only if",  A being has free will if and only if</i><br>
<i>&gt; it can not predict what it will do next. If A = B  then it is also true that</i><br>
<i>&gt; not A = not B, thus because it means exactly the same thing, I am of course</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly happy with the following statement: A being does not have free will</i><br>
<i>&gt; if and only if it can predict what it can do next.</i><br>
<p>
The meaning of your "if and only if" is quite clear, but that doesn't change<br>
the fact that taking the logical negative of the classic definition changes<br>
the meaning; something which your next statement shows is your intent anyway:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This redefinition thus leads a couple of problems: The first is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that it changes the the established meaning of a term which goes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; back millenia in human culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I sure hope so, because the established meaning of the term is, well...,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it has no meaning, its not even wrong, its gibberish.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the established meaning is not so incomprehensible.  I'll even<br>
bring in self-referencing to try to close the gap between the two meanings by<br>
presenting the classical meaning in a somewhat narrower way along with yours:<br>
<p>
1. Classical:  A self-referencing locus of the acausal.<br>
2. Yours:      The state of self-referenced unpredictability.<br>
<p>
I think it is unreasonable to say that the classical meaning is not: both <br>
meaningful and distinct from yours.  I'm sure a great many people would see<br>
it as having a crystal clear meaning.<br>
<p>
In any case, having an agreed upon meaning for words is already a difficult<br>
enough problem in our society without people going around redefining words<br>
on the fly.  Considering what this kind of redefinition does to the signal<br>
to noise ratio within our society's communication, there really is no excuse<br>
for not coining a new word or phase for capturing a meaning which is as<br>
distinct as this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;John:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Yes, I've found that nearly everybody I meet on the street has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;exactly the same opinions I do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Omega:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is not at all my experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Holy cow, what a revaluation! Let me write this down before I forget it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The people who sit next to me on the buss may not have exactly the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinions I do about Anarchy, Atheism, Nanotechnology, Uploading or Turing's</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution of the Entscheidungproblem and its relationship to free will.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thank you for the insight you have given me about my fellow man.</i><br>
<p>
You were the one who mentioned "everybody I meet on the street" in the <br>
first place, but again, that doesn't change the fact that the redefinition<br>
you espouse is being hyped by one very well defined and fairly narrow <br>
segment of our culture to the detriment of the general ability of our <br>
culture to communicate within itself.<br>
