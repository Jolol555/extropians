<i>&gt; will the free market solve everything ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; why then worry about the future ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; why then make plans for the future ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; why then contribute other than to buy and to provide ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; i buy therefore i am ?</i><br>
<p>
You and I /are/ the future.  The free market is just one tool<br>
we will use to make it.  If you want to "contribute" with<br>
self-sacrifice, I won't stop you.  But that zero-sum way of<br>
looking at life--that I cannot benefit others except at my<br>
expense--causes stagnation.  The future is created when bold<br>
individuals create new things for their own benefit, and by<br>
voluntary trade benefit others as well.<br>
<p>
Many people say that a child reaches maturity when he first<br>
thinks of the welfare of others.  I have no doubt that this is<br>
an important step, because those others form the world in which<br>
he will live the rest of his life.  But there's an important<br>
further step that they miss: the first contract.  The first time<br>
one willingly obligates oneself to another for the benefit of<br>
both.  That is the act that creates the future.  Sharing a toy<br>
with your sister is fine, but trading one of your old ones for<br>
one of hers to produce a new toy for both, or agreeing to pool<br>
your allowances to buy an expensive toy and schedule its use by<br>
agreement, those are the acts that create a better future for<br>
everyone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; there must be more to life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; but then maybe i'm an idealist...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Joost de Lyser</i><br>
<p>
We're all idealists, we just have different ideals.  I see<br>
nothing more fundamentally moral, responsible, life-affirming--<br>
indeed beautiful-- than the act of trade.  No motive more noble<br>
than profit.  No measure of value better than the dollar.  You<br>
still seem to have some emotional attachment to selfless<br>
altruism.  I can't answer your emotional needs, you'll have to<br>
do that for yourself.  If there's ever anything I /can/ do for<br>
you, just offer me a fair price.<br>
