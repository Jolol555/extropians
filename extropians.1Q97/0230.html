JAPAN'S "J-BRAIN" PROJECT (2000-2005) VISION<br>
<p>
   The so-called "J-Brain Project" (J=Japanese) is an ambition of mine to<br>
   see Japan invest in a large (2000 scientists and engineers) national<br>
   project to build/grow/evolve an artificial brain with 10 million<br>
   evolved neural net modules, over the time period 2000-2005. This in<br>
   NOT an official announcement of such a project, its only an ambition<br>
   of mine, and is something I am working towards. Its one of the main<br>
   reasons why I came to Japan in the first place.<br>
   <br>
   How realistic is such a project?<br>
   <br>
   You will be able to see from other sections and papers on this web<br>
   site, that our Brain Builder Group has already put about 10 million<br>
   artificial neurons together. (See the new 2D model on the Image File<br>
   2). We are confident that by 2001, we will have achieved our target of<br>
   a billion artificial neurons. The numbers are no longer the issue. The<br>
   next problem to be confronted was how to evolve each neural module<br>
   quickly. This problem will be solved by the summer of 1997, with the<br>
   completion of the CAM-Brain Machine (CBM), which uses FPGAs (Xilinx's<br>
   XC6264 chips) to evolve a neural net module in about 0.1 second (with<br>
   about 30 neurons embedded in a cellular automata space of about 2000<br>
   CA cells). As each module is evolved, the resulting CA circuitry is<br>
   downloaded into a tiny fraction of a gigabyte (or more) of RAM. The<br>
   same programmable CBM can then be reprogrammed to update the whole<br>
   huge space in a small fraction of a second. At the moment, the idea is<br>
   to imagine the RAM as a large apartment block, with empty cubes where<br>
   the evolved module's CA circuitry is downloaded. Between these hollow<br>
   cubes are software generated CA-trail communication highways<br>
   connecting modules. The high level design is human dictated, the<br>
   modules are evolved with human specified functions. Thus the approach<br>
   is a compromise of top down human design (at architecture level), and<br>
   bottom up evolution (at module level).<br>
   <br>
   Imagine it takes an evolutionary engineer (an EE) (see the talk on<br>
   this web site "Million Module Neural Systems Evolution : The Next Step<br>
   in ATR's Billion Neuron Artificial Brain ("CAM-Brain") Project") one<br>
   hour to conceive and evolve a neural net module (and to consider its<br>
   function in relation to a global architecture of all the modules and<br>
   their connections). How many modules could a small team of 5 people<br>
   evolve in a year? The answer is about 10,000. Such a brain building<br>
   project could be undertaken by university groups and small start up<br>
   companies, so long as they had a CBM and a lot of RAM in their<br>
   workstation. With 30 people over 3 years, roughly 200,000 modules<br>
   could be evolved. (If sheets of modules are needed, e.g. a retinal<br>
   layer, then the CBM could be run under software control to evolve<br>
   large numbers of modules, each only marginally different from its<br>
   neighbors. This would significantly increase the efficiency of the<br>
   project). I hope my Brain Builder Group will start building a 10,000<br>
   module system in 1997. If that is a success, then it is likely that<br>
   the size of the Brain Builder Group at ATR will increase to division<br>
   size, so that about 30 people could work for 3 years, to build a<br>
   200,000 module system. We would become true "brain architects". If the<br>
   larger project is a success, then I think the time would be ripe (i.e.<br>
   around the year 2000) to launch a major national brain builder<br>
   project. Hence the idea of the "J-Brain Project".<br>
   <br>
   International Competition<br>
   <br>
   Brain Building I believe will become one of the main technological<br>
   activities of nations in the early 21st century. It will be the<br>
   vehicle by which nations measure their scientific and economic<br>
   prowess. Since Japan has roughly 4 times the savings rate of the US,<br>
   and invests in itself far more heavily than the US, I prefer to see<br>
   Japan become the world leader in this new field. In fact I'm rather<br>
   cynical that America will be able to even pay for such an undertaking.<br>
   The US consumes more than it produces, with Japan paying most of the<br>
   shortfall in the form of buying US government bonds and the like. The<br>
   interest on this debt is now impacting badly on America's ability to<br>
   fund blue sky research. The US brain drain to Japan is already<br>
   underway. I see it every day, living in Japanese research labs. Since<br>
   I plan 10 to 20 years ahead, I reason that Japan is the best place to<br>
   brain-build. Thats why I live in Japan.<br>
   <br>
   The only way I see the US spending big money on brain building is if<br>
   the field is seen as having strategic (i.e. national security)<br>
   implications. America's DoD (Department of Defence) could spend big<br>
   money if it felt it necessary. Our Brain Builder Group now closely<br>
   collaborates with the Chinese, so if the Americans do feel that the<br>
   field could become strategic, then they cannot afford to let the<br>
   Chinese get too far ahead.<br>
   <br>
   I see Japan as America's main economic rival and China as America's<br>
   new political rival, perhaps even a future enemy. I have a similar<br>
   love-hate relationship with the Chinese as I have with the Japanese. I<br>
   have a great pride in Japan's economic achievements and its likelihood<br>
   of being number one for a generation (2000-2030) before China takes<br>
   over and dominates (with its 1.2 billion people and 10+% growth<br>
   rates). China was civilized millenia before either the west or Japan.<br>
   Europe's dominance for the past 5 centuries is a mere historical<br>
   glitch from the the Chinese 5000 year cultural perspective. They know<br>
   they will dominate next century. So do I. I want to be part of the<br>
   action, even though I am disgusted at their nepotism. (The problem<br>
   with being cosmopolitan, is that its impossible to share the same<br>
   prejudices and ignorances of a local population. The greater the level<br>
   of cosmopolitanism, the greater the cynicism, I find).<br>
   <br>
   So - if any US DoD or NSA types read this and get alarmed, dont<br>
   assassinate me, just ask me to collaborate with you. I will tell<br>
   anyone who seriously wants to collaborate with our Brain Builder<br>
   Group, everything that I know. We already collaborate with groups in<br>
   Japan, China, US, and Europe. I have no particular loyality to any one<br>
   country, because I have lived in 6. I guess deep down (and in the long<br>
   term), I'm a Cosmist. (I think it would be a tragedy if humanity does<br>
   not develop the next VASTLY superior species in the coming centuries.<br>
   That would be a cosmic error.) So playing with potential international<br>
   rivalries only accelerates the rise of Cosmism. I'm quite upfront<br>
   about this. I believe this new Cosmist doctrine will dominate 21st<br>
   century global politics. (See the Cosmist essays on this web page).<br>
