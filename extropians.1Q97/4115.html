	No.  As previously posted by another, the mitochondrial DNA would<br>
be different in a clone, but not in a monozygotic twin.<br>
<p>
: &gt;         No.  Cloning would diminish the gene pool by lowering diversity.<br>
<p>
: Yeah, but you wouldn't have to worry about "lethal" genes.<br>
<p>
	Not is *this* generation.<br>
<p>
: But what difference, you clone ten thousand "&lt;insert name here&gt;"<br>
: and these clones each have two chidren with ten thousand regular people.<br>
: You have not really lowered the gene pool any more than if this person<br>
: had had ten thousand children.<br>
<p>
	Ah, like Wilt Chamberlain ;-).<br>
<p>
: Like if they made a run on the sperm bank<br>
: for the genes of a given person.<br>
<p>
	It would, however, lower the diversity of the gene pool more than<br>
if ten thousand "regular people" had two children each with ten thousand<br>
other "regular people".  If we knew enough about what genes were beneficial<br>
and which were detrimental, it might make sense to practise eugenics, and<br>
cloning could play a part in that.  Even so, it is not necessary to clone<br>
adults.  Separating embryos at the four or eight cell stage will work much<br>
better.<br>
	Since something like 90% of the DNA is of unknown function (some<br>
of it used to be called "junk DNA"), it would be very dangerous for us to<br>
act as if we knew what matings were best for the long-term survival and/or<br>
improvement of the human species.  Many alleles which seem less fit for<br>
this environment may confer advantages to their owners in an altered en-<br>
vironment.  I think that such genes as those which can increase melanin<br>
production and make heat transfer to the environment more efficient could<br>
prove essential as the ozone layer becomes thinner and the earth gets war-<br>
mer.  These potential changes are only two which happen to come to mind;<br>
there are surely others which we know nothing about as yet.<br>
<p>
: &gt;         I don't think that enough is yet known to improve the odds over<br>
: &gt; the old-fashioned way of making brainy and/or fit offspring by people<br>
: &gt; with those characteristics mating with others having like attributes.<br>
<p>
: But yes, I suppose the old fashioned way has it's benefit<br>
:  <br>
	It's cost-effective and lots more enjoyable.  Besides, having both<br>
parents available to provide either a "brainy" or "brawny" environment in<br>
which to raise the child would confer additional benefits to those provided<br>
by genetics.<br>
<p>
: Accept in a rare case where say, a really nice person with Tay-Sachs<br>
: disease,<br>
: wanted to have chidren but couldn't find a suitable partner.<br>
: Or Tay-Sachs trait rather.<br>
: Would be a way for them to pass on something to a next generation.<br>
: Or just plain sterile people.<br>
<p>
	Either germline therapy to modify the Tay-Sachs gene or selection<br>
of gametes to choose only those not carrying the Tay-Sachs trait would be<br>
a better method than cloning.  N.b., every adult with Tay-Sachs trait must<br>
have at least one normal gene, or (s)he would never have reached adulthood,<br>
so ~50% of the gametes could be used for in vitro fertilization.  Once the<br>
gene has been sequenced, a four- or eight-cell embryo could be analysed for<br>
presence of the normal gene, then implanted if the Tay-Sachs trait was ab-<br>
sent.<br>
	If we sterilized everyone with "bad" genes, we'd lose Stephen Hawk-<br>
ing, and a lot of other "really nice" people.  Furthermore, such action<br>
would be morally reprehensible.  I am completely against doing something<br>
which is both evil and stupid.<br>
