<p>
O.K., you guys have helped me update my default image of<br>
anarcho-capitalism.  So let me think out loud:<br>
<p>
We start with large states as we have now, with a "monopoly of force"<br>
within their area, who primarily choose laws to cover interactions<br>
between their citizens, but who also negotiate laws to cover<br>
interactions, including travel, between their citizens and those of<br>
other states.  These laws are largely chosen via centralized political<br>
processes, but sometimes they consider the possibility that<br>
disatisfied citizens will move elsewhere.<br>
<p>
Then we imagine shrinking these territorial entities, ending perhaps<br>
with urban towers or planned suburbs.  Each entity is likely still a<br>
"state" in the sense of holding a monopoly on local "force", i.e.,<br>
fighting professionals who patrol and are ready to respond to calls<br>
for help.  But ease of moving between entities and of creating new<br>
such entities keeps entities competitive and hence accountable, by<br>
switching attention from voting with "voice" to voting with "feet".<br>
And the change in scale switches the legal focus to law regarding<br>
interactions between citizens of differing entities, rather than<br>
between citizens of the same entity.<br>
<p>
As entity scale decreases, competition should bite first regarding<br>
laws of people and things which are the most mobile and interactions<br>
that most easily cross entity boundaries.  Mobile capital should be<br>
respected early, as well as trade across porous borders, while<br>
protecting people with high moving costs against domestic violence on<br>
may happen late.  And with sufficient competitive pressures on a legal<br>
issue, territorial entities may be willing to let this issue be<br>
taken over by non-territorial entities.<br>
<p>
Given this picture, I see two contrary stability concerns:<br>
<p>
TOO LITTLE COORDINATION -- These diverse entities may suffer severe<br>
free rider problems regarding "public" goods such as national defense.<br>
Hopefully donations, social pressure, and the self-interest of large<br>
entities would be enough to get by.  But if coordination comes by<br>
refusing to do business with entities that won't contribute, that may<br>
be enough coordination to create the next problem:<br>
<p>
TOO MUCH COORDINATION -- In some times and places, such small local<br>
monopolies of force seem to have agreed to leave each other alone to<br>
prey on their "citizens".  Coordination may allow them to punish<br>
deviant entities which treat their people nicely and take in refugees.<br>
We need to better understand why this happens so we can work to<br>
prevent it.  <br>
