        Hi all!<br>
<p>
<p>
        I'm holding my virtual wine glass high in the air in a toast to the<br>
PopExtrop Art Convention (actually a party!)  It's happening down in L.A. as<br>
I write this, and, knowing how these parties go, will probably be<br>
'happening' into the wee-small hours of the night.  For all those who are as<br>
of yet unenlightened as to what exactly is happening in the world of<br>
Extropic Art, I'll fill you in.<br>
<p>
        Extropic Art is a recently launched movement that endeavours in the<br>
conveyance of extropian memes through art.  This art can be anything from<br>
painting to writing to computer imaging, acting, living (check out Automorph<br>
Art...a subset) and, my specialty, poetry.  What we, as Extropic Artists,<br>
are intending to do is to bring the extropian ideas to the general populous.<br>
As I've mentioned many times before, most people enjoy art of some sort.<br>
When they happen upon a certain piece of art that they like, they'll tend to<br>
question *why* the artist did the work or what a certain brushstroke etc.<br>
was for.  Once they have the question in their minds, they are open to<br>
answers, thus inviting them to new ideas such as extropy.<br>
<p>
        So to those in the area of L.A. who are not already at the party, I<br>
must ask *why not*?  :-)  With that said, I'll bow my head and send my<br>
greetings and gratitude to all those at the party...I wish I could be there!<br>
<p>
<p>
                                        Cheers!<br>
<p>
                                                -E. Shaun Russell<br>
