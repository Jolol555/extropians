Johnny Carwash:<br>
<i>&gt;I take it very personally when scientists are made to look foolish.</i><br>
<p>
I really must ask what you mean by this statement.  Most <br>
transhumanists have had at least the basic scientific training and we <br>
presuppose a base of support for scientific endeavor that is <br>
reflected in all our areas of expression--research, engineering, <br>
philosophy, art.  What, then, has been done to make scientists look <br>
foolish?  How can an artistic endeavor so threaten the basic laws of <br>
physics as to render them in need of an attack on the artist in <br>
question?   <br>
<p>
I myself have begun to write my first piece of science fiction and <br>
expect to be asking some technical questions myself.  If I choose to <br>
approach persons on the transhumanist lists, I know from prior <br>
experience that I can expect an enthusiastic and positive response.  <br>
And if I do make some egregious scientific error, I expect to share a <br>
good laugh about it with the scientist who discovers it.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
