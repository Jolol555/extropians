<i>&gt; From:          Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lcrocker@calweb.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It was not a complete description.  I make no appologies for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; since covering all the bases would have turned a paragraph into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; documentary.  To do so was not necessary to the point I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; making.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm all for brevity; I use it (perhaps too much) myself. If I</i><br>
<i>&gt; misinterpret your elided meaning, please clarify.  But what I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are referring to is the very common perception of libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideology that we have naive faith that free markets solve lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt; human problems and makes everyone peaceful and prosperous--in short,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the L. Neil Smith fantasy world.</i><br>
<p>
That's reasonably close to my intended meaning.  I would alter it<br>
only to add a belief that free markets will inevitably yield good<br>
results without any kind of adjustment outside of what occurs<br>
naturally within the market itself.  Most are aware that  free<br>
markets have some tendency to be self-correcting.  But it appears<br>
from much of the discussion here that some have expanded this into a<br>
belief that free markets will be self-correcting in all possible<br>
scenarios, and that they have no inherent failure modes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is my contention that very few of the libertarians I know are</i><br>
<i>&gt; like that.  Most are more accepting of many present systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanting to change things in the free market direction where they</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel it is needed.  Some, like me, hold moral positions that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; free market is a necessity, but even we don't think it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; without problems.  We just believe problems in a free market are</i><br>
<i>&gt; created by reality rather than by the state.  I recognize reality's</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to create problems for me; I make no such grant to any state.</i><br>
<p>
In that case, I may well have been mistaken.  At least about the<br>
views of some Libertarians even if not all.  Perhaps the real<br>
disagreement here is not about what will make an economic system<br>
function properly, but about what the proper function of an economic<br>
system should be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You ask me to recognize that there are "problems" with capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; that libertarian ideology doesn't deal with.  That's two claims: (1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Capitalism has problems, and (2) Libertarians don't deal with them. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first I concede: yes, capitalism has precisely those problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the nature of human life and reality have--but without those</i><br>
<i>&gt; additional ones created by states.</i><br>
<p>
It seems to me that the proper function of an economic system is to <br>
solve some of those problems (the ones that the nature of human life <br>
and reality have) rather than just reflecting them on a larger scale.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The second might be true, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it may be an impression left by the fact that the most vocal</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians tend to be the most evangelical, and don't like to talk</i><br>
<i>&gt; about problems even if they do recognize them.</i><br>
<p>
That thought has occurred to me.<br>
<p>
                                        Peace,<br>
                                        William Kitchen<br>

The future is ours to create.<br>
