MKdoesV.  The QT spin is surely justification *before* the fact, since it<br>
occurred to me as I was reading, rather than after Gibson confirmed it<br>
(unless *he* was pulling *my* leg, which may be what you're suggesting.)<br>
<p>
I figured it out the way a chicken sexer does it, through codes invisible to<br>
the human eye - I'm just *very good at it* as a result of an injudiciously<br>
large amount of sf reading over, um, 40-something years.  I wish I was as<br>
efficient in some skill that paid $$$...<br>
<p>
BTW, it helps your enjoyment if you notice that many of the characters in<br>
DIFFERENCE ENGINE are from Victorian literature: e.g., Sybil Gerard, Dandy<br>
Mick and Egremont are from Disraeli's 1845 SYBIL.<br>
