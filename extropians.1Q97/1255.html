I think one problem, Lyle, might be that you're considering two<br>
different classes of difficulty.  Once Abel had decided to do math, he<br>
could focus his life and try to do math despite sundry material<br>
obstacles.  That's one kind of discouragement -- no one wants to pay you<br>
for what you do best.  (Cue Sasha.)  But what women have often faced is<br>
being told that they can't do anything intellectual, that it's<br>
unladylike, etc.  Being conditioned at an early age so that you never<br>
desire an interest to do math or the confidence to feel that it will be<br>
worth trying is a completely different kind of discouragement from<br>
simply startving.  "Free will": you can do what you want, not want what<br>
you want.  Perhaps not enough women have wanted to do math enough to<br>
have geniuses.  Is that genetic, or because not enough women have been<br>
allowed to want to be mathematicians?<br>
<p>
[Above and beyond not being taught to read, not being allowed to walk<br>
out to the library, actually there probably isn't a public library until<br>
recently... I don't know how fair it is to claim that women's obstacles<br>
were overcomable if they'd wanted to before the past two centuries.]<br>
<p>
Another anecdotal data point: Caltech is a very small, very elite<br>
school.  3:1 male-female ratio among the undergraduates.  A friend told<br>
me recently that at a student house women's meeting most of the people<br>
there had admitted having feelings of inferiority to males.  Many female<br>
students do quite well here, so I doubt it is because they obviously do<br>
worse en masse.  Even if they did, would that justify the feeling of<br>
inferiority or be a result of it?  Chicken and egg.<br>
<p>
What's worse is that there is cultural differentiation among the houses,<br>
and this was one of the more laid-back, liberated, mixed doubles,<br>
houses.  Not a house of Christians and very quiet Asian girls.  [Oh.<br>
Average House population is ~100.]<br>
