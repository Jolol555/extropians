I lost the tail of the last post:<br>
<p>
'gene:<br>
<p>
I feel confirmation of these results to be very important. From countless<br>
possible physical machinery the one supporting above fitness function<br>
shape has crystallized. If we are to harness darwinian evolution for<br>
autochthonous system design we must choose one boasting above features.<br>
At least we should give the system opportunity to precipitate a<br>
near-optimal shape spontaneously via ALife methodology. If proteins (as<br>
it is to be supposed) mimick RNA in their folding/function antics, de<br>
novo protein design is equivalent to solving the protein folding problem<br>
(indeed doing it pretty rapidly (on minute scale), so we can apply darwinian<br>
evolution to select for those shapes we need.<br>

3.1 Evolution in Sequence Space<br>
<p>
Think of organisms as occupying a "genotype space" consisting of all<br>
possible sequence of all possible lengths of the elements of the genetic<br>
system (i.e., nucleotides or machine instruction), When the first<br>
organism begins replicating, a single self-replicating creature, with a<br>
single sequence of a certain length, occupies a single point in genotype<br>
space. However, as the creature replicates in the environment, a<br>
population of creatures forms, and errors cause genetic variation, such<br>
that the population will form a cloud of points in the genotypic space<br>
centered around the central point.<br>
<p>
Because the new genotypes that form the cloud are formed by random<br>
processes, most of them are completely inviable and die without<br>
reproducing. However, some of them are capable of reproduction. These new<br>
genotypes persist, and, because some of them are affected by mutation,<br>
the cloud of points spreads further. However, not all of the viable<br>
genomes are equally viable. Some of them discover tricks to replicate<br>
more efficiently. These genotypes increase in frequency, causing the<br>
population of creatures at the corresponding points in the genotype space<br>
to increase.<br>
<p>
Points in the genotype space occupied by greater populations of<br>
individuals will spawn large numbers of mutant offspring; thus, the<br>
density of the cloud of points in the genotype space will shift gradually<br>
in the direction of the more fit genotypes. Over time, the cloud of<br>
points will percolate through the genotype space, either expanding<br>
outward as a result of random drift or by flowing along fitness gradients.<br>
<p>
Most of the volume of this space represents completely inviable<br>
sequences. These regions of the space may be momentarily and sparsely<br>
occupied by inviable mutants, but the cloud will never flow into the<br>
inviable regions. The cloud of genotypes may bifurcate as it flows into<br>
habitable regions in different directions, and it may split as large<br>
genetic changes spawn genotypes in distant but viable regions of the<br>
space. We may imagine that the evolving population of creatures will take<br>
the form of wispy clouds flowing through this space.<br>
<p>
Now imagine for a moment the situation that there was no selection. This<br>
implies that every sequence is replicated at an equal rate. Mutation will<br>
cause the cloud of points to expand outward, eventually filling the space<br>
uniformly. In this situation, the complexity of the structure of the of<br>
the cloud of points does not increase through time, only the volume that<br>
it occupies. Under selection by contrast, through time the cloud will<br>
take on an intricate structure as it flows along fitness gradients and<br>
percolates by drift through narrow regions of viability in a largely<br>
uninhabitable space.<br>
<p>
Consider that the viable region of the genotype space is a very small<br>
subset of the total volume of the space, but that it probably exhibits a<br>
very complex shape, forming tendrils and sheets sparsely permeating the<br>
otherwise empty space. The complex structure of this cloud can be<br>
considered to be a product of evolution by natural selection. This<br>
thought experiment appears to imply that the intricate structure that the<br>
cloud of genotypes may assume through evolution is fully deterministic.<br>
Its shape is predefined by the physics and chemistry and the structure of<br>
the environment [here T.S. Ray forgets to mention (in another passage he<br>
does) that the major share of the environment (=fitness function) is<br>
modulated by another individuals, which makes it uncomfortably<br>
hyperactive (Red Queen phenomenon ("Well, in _our_ country", said Alice,<br>
still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else -- if you<br>
ran very fast for a long time as we've been doing." "A slow kind of<br>
country!" said the Queen. "Now, _here_, you see, it takes all the running<br>
_you_ can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere<br>
else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!" -- "Through the<br>
Looking Glass", C.L. Dodgson) ], in much the same way that the form of the<br>
Mandelbrot set is predetermined by its defining equation. The complex<br>
structure of this viable space is inherent in the medium and is an<br>
example of "order for free" [44].<br>
<p>
No living world will ever fill the entire viable subspace, either at a<br>
single moment of time, or even cumulatively over its entire history. The<br>
region usually filled will be strongly influenced by the original<br>
self-replicating sequence and by stochastic forces that will by chance<br>
push the cloud down a subset of possible habitable pathways. Furthermore,<br>
coevolution and ecological interactions imply that certain regions can<br>
only be occupied when certain other regions are also occupied. This<br>
concept of the flow of genotypes throught the genotype space is<br>
esentially the same as that discussed by Eigen [22] in the context of<br>
"quasispecies". Eigen limited his dicussion to species of viruses, where<br>
it is also easy to think of sequence spaces. Here, I am extending the<br>
concept beyond the bounds of the species to include entire phylogenies of<br>
species.<br>
<p>
P.S. T.S. Ray arguments that the brittleness of GA-growing machine code<br>
     is due to its degeneracity. I rather think it to be an intrinsic<br>
     property of the system itself: some of the instructions are simply<br>
     too powerful. Overall, the system lacks that intricate webwork of<br>
     neutral paths, and mutation rate maps, etc. this is what makes it<br>
     brittle. (This also might be a rather unwelcome property of<br>
     FPGA-flavoured EHW).<br>
