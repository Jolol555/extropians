&lt;I'm thinking of picking up D. H. Fischer's most recent work, on price <br>

<p>
I have not read Fischer's work on inflationary cycles. I do know that, <br>
along with W. Erwin Diewert, Fischer is considered one of the masters <br>
of price and index-number theory.  His Fischer 'ideal' index for the <br>
cost of living is one of two functional forms (the other being <br>
Tornqvist's) known as 'superlative' indexes that effectively account <br>
for substitutions in the types and qualities of goods, services and <br>
technology when tracking some measure of their cost to society over <br>
time.<br>
<p>
The Consumer and Producer Price Indexes produced by the Bureau of <br>
Labor Statistics have no problem obtaining a good sample of costs for <br>
goods and services, the operational difficulty is in real-time <br>
tracking of the change in quantities sold over time.(*) As a <br>
historical researcher, Fischer has the advantage of working at a lag <br>
and analyzing changes in both price and quantity.<br>

(*) Point-of-sale scanner data for consumer goods, as well as <br>
electronic-data-transfer (EDT) info for manufacturer materials orders, <br>
may eventually provide more of the quantitative data that would be <br>
needed to produce superlative indexes; but for now, most of this data <br>
remains proprietary.<br>
