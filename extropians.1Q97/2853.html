It ought to have; it will be an infant while the clonee is an adult. <br>
Sorry, we haven't got the faintest idea yet about how to fast-grow a <br>
clone body (nanotech *might* work). <br>
<p>
Clones are just younger identical twins. <br>

<p>
Yes, prejudice is likely. On the other hand, it is hard to see if <br>
somebody is cloned ("Yes, he does look a lot like his father did when he <br>
was younger"). I seem to recall one of the stories in Flynn's _The <br>
Nanotech Chronicles_ which dealt with a clone family and some prejudices <br>
against it. <br>
