Steve,<br>

<i>&gt; Isn't Bell's inequality derived correctly from QM as we know it?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, a totally correct result of orthodox theory.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't it show that (if true) hidden variables don't help unless you</i><br>
<i>&gt; also relax some other pretty *reasonable* assumptions?</i><br>
<p>
Depends upon your definition of "reasonable".  Is the presence of<br>
advanced-action unreasonable?  A very impressive set of arguments<br>
can be made that its absence is even more unreasonable.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Aren't there some experiments (one by Aspick? (sp?)) that pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; convincingly demonstrate the inequality?</i><br>
<p>
The name is "Aspect", and I believe some others have worked on this<br>
too, although I don't have any other names.  My impression is that<br>
his work is fairly well accepted.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If so, then isn't von Neumann's mistake pretty much a moot point?</i><br>
<p>
Not at all, it's hard to see how the discovery and recognition of <br>
advanced-action as a fundamental principle of physics could be any-<br>
thing but a major breakthough in our understanding of reality.<br>
<p>
Not only is Von Neumann's mistake not moot, it is IMO the biggest<br>
obstacle within existing theory blocking fundamental scientific <br>
progress into the nature of reality.<br>
