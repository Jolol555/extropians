<i>&gt;    The fossil record for cats is not very complete, but the earliest,</i><br>

<i>&gt;(roughly 40 million years ago), with retractile claws and dentition</i><br>
<i>&gt;like modern cats, with additionally some having "saber-like" upper</i><br>
<i>&gt;canines.  The book has an photograph of a complete fossil Oligocene</i><br>
<i>&gt;sabertooth skeleton, length perhaps a bit more than a meter from nose</i><br>
<i>&gt;to base of tail, and has drawings of skulls of several other Oligocene</i><br>
<i>&gt;large-toothed cats, that size and a little larger; later ones were</i><br>
<i>&gt;bigger still.  This family lasted through the Pliocene.  _Felidae_ --</i><br>
<i>&gt;the family to which modern cats belong -- appeared in the Miocene, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;later in the Miocene and in the Pliocene radiated into both</i><br>
<i>&gt;saber-toothed and non-saber-toothed species; some saber-toothed</i><br>
<i>&gt;_Felidae_ had skulls almost as large as those of modern lions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Saber-toothed _Felidae_ survived until the end of the Pleistocene, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;may have coexisted with humans.  "Saber teeth" are an adaptation that</i><br>
<i>&gt;has occurred at least four separate times in mammals, likely as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;specialized adaptation for killing large prey, likely by ambush.</i><br>
<p>
Still this says very little about those Nimravidae, i know sabertooths were<br>
big (fatalis WAS as big as a lion), i also know they were not very smart,<br>
but more importantly, they didn't live in Africa. I know there must have<br>
been a somewhat similar big cat in africa (the marks in the skulls). But i<br>
found nothing about pre-panthera felidae in africa around 4 million yrs ago,<br>
and this book doesn't tell me anything new, except the genera name of<br>
Nimravidae (for which i thank you a lot). In my last posting i had already<br>
assumed a smilodon like (slightly smaller, slightly more intelligent)<br>
species, what's new is that it probably did have retractable claws, thats<br>
all this adds. In order to compare the cats and match them with Afarensis,<br>
one needs to know what their capabilities were, (unless we want to keep<br>
comparing/matching chimps with cheetahs/leopards). From what i've seen so<br>
far in this tread, if a group of chimps can handle a leopard, and (late)<br>
afarensis was a tool user. Any predator cat, has to be a multitude more<br>
dangerous than modern big cats, to form any real threath to the survival of<br>
Afarensis as a species. And if the pro AAT group wants to talk about<br>
pre-Australopithicenes, they'd be talking about apes, not hominids. <br>

I think we both agree it was a big cat, I just wan't you to realize that<br>
todays big cats, are not the same as 3.5 million years old big cats. If YOU<br>
believe in evolution, you have to acknowledge that even though the<br>
improvements to these cats, are nowhere near the ones that appeared in<br>
Hominids, there will have been improvements.  <br>
<p>
 I'll tell you one thing, I've never heard <br>
<i>&gt;of an ecosystem, past or present, that had prey species but no predators, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and besides Lucy there were many other types of tasty meat running around, </i><br>
<i>&gt;several varieties of pigs and a sort of dwarf hippopotamus among others. </i><br>
<p>
I guess an ecosystem without predator species automatically excludes 'prey'<br>
species, but i get your point. I think you're still looking at Afarensis as<br>
a prey species by definition. Did any of my posting about the chimps being<br>
able to handle the leopards get trough to you ? I think big cats did<br>
occasionally grab an afarensis: a young one, an old or diseased one, or a<br>
healthy one that they were able to single out, just like todays lion can<br>
kill the occasional human. I still don't think afarensis was by definition a<br>
'prey' species. Gestation size and time exclude that option, it would not<br>
have been so widely spread if it was. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I very much doubt that "all" were, but we do know that Lucy lived near a lake </i><br>
<i>&gt;that was full of crocodiles.</i><br>
<p>
It would be interesting to know how many and which ones lived in the red sea<br>
at the time, and what evidence there is left in humans today that suggests<br>
an Aquatic ape being capable of defending itself from attacks from the<br>
water, and maybe also from under water.  <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;You're assuming that because we are enormously smarter than Lucy was then </i><br>
<i>&gt;present day predators must be enormously smarter than the predators of</i><br>
Lucy's day. It's not so. <br>
<p>
Look up a picture of a smilodon skull - It's FLAT where the brain should be,<br>
where todays big cats have much rounder skulls. Are you assuming all species<br>
evolution stopped when the first hominids arrived ? We are talking about<br>
predators that were less dangerous (to whatever degree), and possible prey<br>
(maybe for a hominid predator) that was easier to catch (also to whatever<br>
degree) than todays comparable species. If you look just at time i'd say<br>
10%, if you look at relatively increasing developments (among all mammals,<br>
not just hominids) i'd be tempted to say more than that.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, if you plotted the average brain size of all animals from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;extinction of the Dinosaurs to now you would find a modest increase, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is nothing modest that happened to the human line. The brains of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;ancestors got almost 5 times as big in just 3 million years, and nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;even close to that has ever happened in Evolution before. This huge</i><br>
<i>&gt;explosion in brain size started at the same moment we developed bipedalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;and a hand that can make complex motions. I don't believe this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;coincidence, and that's why I think the bipedalism question is so important.</i><br>
<p>
Many other homonid and homonoid species were bipedal, why didn't they<br>
develop intelligence ? why did they become extinct instead, just because<br>
there was one who was better ? I think maybe, more efficient bipedalism and<br>
complex hand motion might be the result of intelligence increase, but it's<br>
harder to believe it was the cause.<br>

<p>
Did it say if it was found alongside habiles skeletons or among afarensis ? <br>
<p>
<p>
Again i'd like to try to end the predator part of the AAT, seen the example<br>
of the chimps beating up/killing the leopards. I think it says it all, and i<br>
assume there's no one who had arguments against that one ? <br>
<p>
That way i can orientate myself on the bipedalism part of the tread a little...<br>
