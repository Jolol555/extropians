<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Now consider how this model works as we approach an era where industrial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;production grows explosively, due to nanotech, or AI, or self-reproducing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;cheap robots, or some other breakthrough. This can cause returns from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;stock to begin increasing at a rapid rate, even faster than the discount</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;factor reduces them.  The result could be that the infinite sum above</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;diverges!  The stock will in fact, today, have an infinite value to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  This assumes the discount rate is unaffected by the explosive economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; growth. But what sane person would use a discount rate that is significantly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lower than the economic growth rate?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was using a different model of the discount rate, where it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;psychological measure of the pain inherent in postponing present</i><br>
<i>&gt;gratification for future reward.  A dollar today is more fun than a</i><br>
<i>&gt;dollar next year, and the degree to which this is true for you will</i><br>
<i>&gt;determine your own personal discount rate.  People whose discount rates</i><br>
<i>&gt;are higher than average (who hate waiting) will tend to be borrowers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and those with lower than average rates will tend to be lenders.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is true that this model does not obviously explain why discount rates</i><br>
<i>&gt;tend to equal long term growth rates, so it might be more plausible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;assume that they track each other.  But it is not clear to me how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence of rapid growth will affect people's willingness to forego</i><br>
<i>&gt;pleasures until tomorrow.</i><br>
<p>
 The economic growth rate is normally a lower bound to the market interest<br>
rate because if the interest rate were lower, it would be profitable to<br>
borrow to finance more investments. People who would be willing to settle<br>
for a 1% return will demand a 30% return if the growth rate is sufficient<br>
to use up all the capital that is available at 30% interest rates.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I would expect the financial explosion to occur a few years to perhaps a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;few decades before the productivity explosion, depending on how farsighted</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  What would cause the value of labor to decline relative to capital</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; years before the cost of duplicating human-level intelligence is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reduced?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't understand what you are getting at here.  I argued that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;value of productive investments is more than commonly recognized, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that eventually the value would therefore increase.  This would imply</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the value of labor will decline relative to capital, not because</i><br>
<i>&gt;labor is less valuable, but because capital would be more so.  To take</i><br>
<p>
 Unless you have discovered some absolute unit of value, this distinction<br>
is unclear to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;an exaggerated example, spending your money on a robot which will build</i><br>
<i>&gt;a million more for free would be better than spending it on a hairdresser.</i><br>
<p>
 It isn't obvious that building the first such robot will require a<br>
different mixture of capital and labor than today's products require.<br>
Once we get robots smart enough to reproduce with zero human intervention,<br>
I don't know what will happen. I was assuming that required human-level<br>
intelligence, but I admit I can't justify that assumption.<br>
 Your robot example still doesn't explain why you expect the capital /<br>
labor ratio to rise years before the productivity explosion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  What would cause the value of cash and cash-like assets to decline?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; One of the reasons that these assets have value is the ability they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; provide to quickly move one's assets into new (unanticapted) investments.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Since my intuition is that the period you are talking about will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; produce enormous uncertainties about which companies will produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; or benefit from breakthroughs in nanotech or AI, I expect I will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; value cash fairly highly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cash is not a productive asset, so to the extend you hold it you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are foregoing the income that you could have made by investing it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If investments are growing much faster than today, then holding cash</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be more costly.</i><br>
<p>
 Cash is a productive asset. It produces flexibility.<br>
