Concerning the year 2000 issue it interesting that the Social Security<br>
Admin was one of the first USA Federal Gov agencies to look into the<br>
matter.  They have developed a list of commercial software which they<br>
use and its Y2000 status and placed it on the web for public usage<br>
<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/year2000/y2klist.htm">http://www.ssa.gov/year2000/y2klist.htm</a>.  DISCLAIMER: I am not a fan<br>
of the SSA, just making an observation.<br>
<p>
Concerning using Y2000 to suddenly and completely eliminate the IRS<br>
(Of which I am also not a fan), I suggest we be careful what we wish for<br>
because we might just get it.  Before I would cheer for a sudden cut off<br>
of all IRS activity, I would first want to what sort of disruptions <br>
would occur in financial markets and related matters.  A sudden end of<br>
IRS activity would reduce USA Federal Gov revenue.  I do not know all<br>
of the ramifications of a sudden and major decline in this revenue, but<br>
I would want to investigate them first.  The situation we are in now<br>
might not be very good, but it could be worse.<br>
<p>
And before all the knee-jerk pounding of the keys starts, I am not defending<br>
either SSA or IRS.  I will now sit back and wait to be criticized for<br>
opinions I never expressed.<br>
<p>
