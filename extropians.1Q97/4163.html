Like most things about the mind, the weight one gives to the opinions of<br>
others (let's call it "swayability") is determined partly by evolution,<br>
partly by culture, and partly by individual reason and experience.  We can<br>
disagree about what weight to assign to these three components.  However, if<br>
there is any significant evolutionary component, I would suspect that it<br>
would push people in the direction of lower swayability than is rational<br>
under current circumstances.<br>
<p>
Under the hunter-gatherer conditions in which our ancestors lived for the<br>
past seven million years, a typical person only knew a hundred or so other<br>
people.  Half of those were kids, and half the adults were stupider than<br>
average.  The chance of coming up with a good idea that nobody else had<br>
thought of was much higher than it is today.  Thus, the likely reward of<br>
doing something most people thought was a bad idea was bigger than it is now.<br>
<p>
This may explain the disparity between how Robin thinks people should act,<br>
and how they actually act.  Are there any other cases like this, that we<br>
might try to explain by evolutionary arguments?  <br>
