I can see that you'd want to take issue with the notion that one<br>
can "engineer" one's values. But I think that if a brainwasher can,<br>
given appropriate control over another person's environment, change<br>
that person's values, then each of us can make deliberate changes<br>
in our own values through self-conditioning. Wanting to have no<br>
desire to smoke tobacco and having no desire to smoke tobacco are<br>
two different things, and I think someone in the first state can,<br>
through deliberate action, transform emself into the second state.<br>
I think this would qualify as a small but deliberate transformation<br>
of one's values. I think larger scale transformations are also<br>
possible.<br>

<p>
I'm sure they're not so crudely organized, and given the actual<br>
complexity of human minds, it's not hard for me to see how I could<br>
have a value which actually shapes my immediate actions now (i. e.<br>
"has much influence"), and yet manage to dump that value through<br>
longer-term changes in my own environment and my own behavior.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Given meta-values, non-meta-values are really strategies and</i><br>
<i> &gt;hueristics, to my way of thinking.  </i><br>
<p>
One of my points is that it's not just one level, nor even just<br>
two levels. There are meta-meta-values above the meta-values. And<br>
even here there's an implicit assumption that the system is<br>
hierarchical, whereas the little bit we know about the brain might<br>
give us reason to believe that the system contains loops. I don't<br>
know how firm and clear a distinction we can draw between values<br>
on the one hand and strategies and heuristics on the other. These<br>
kinds of distinctions only hold up within systems composed of<br>
black-boxes. The brain doesn't seem to use a black-box architecture.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;We can transform our abilities, perceptions, knowledge, insight,</i><br>
<i> &gt;wisdom, experience, bodily form, network of associates, etc.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see how anyone could change all those things and not<br>
experience some changes of values as well. It's not as if ones<br>
values are easily extricable and separable from that other stuff.<br>
The fact-value dichotomy aside, one can't effectively evaluate<br>
stuff within a field in which one has no knowledge, and generally,<br>
learning more about a field of knowledge changes the way in which<br>
one evaluates within that field of knowledge. <br>
<p>
A person might have no sense of mathematical beauty and decide ey<br>
wants to change that.  After studying mathematics for a long time,<br>
such a person might develop a sense of mathematical beauty which<br>
would then have motivating influence in how ey carries out mathematical<br>
work. This serves as an example of the deliberate development of<br>
a new value or set of values. The desire to understand and experience<br>
mathematical beauty (in one who has no direct experience of<br>
mathematical beauty) is not the same a lust or desire for experiences<br>
of mathematical beauty, yet the latter can be deliberately developed<br>
out of the former.  Trying to view this from your perspective, it<br>
seems that you think the former and the latter are "really" somehow<br>
the same.  Am I misinterpreting your position?<br>
