O.K., I name this: start in 1900, and make historical facts fit a 3.4<br>
year cycle based on radioactive decay.   I named it, let's see you do it.<br>
Then let's see how plausible folks here think your story it.<br>

How do you ever walk into a new building and find room 225?  After<br>
all, your eyes and ears aren't giving your numbers, so there is no<br>
way to know if your vague feeling that you should head toward that<br>
thing that looks like up stairs is something real and testable, rather<br>
than pure chance patterns.  Do you really start writing down numbers?<br>
