<p>
IAN: One way to know is to examine the evidence relative to police <br>
powers and the deployments thereof. Now it is NOT a matter of suspicion, <br>
excessive or otherwise,  that police powers are growing and that they <br>
are only growing. Legislation, such as the anti-terrorist bill, and court<br>
rulings that give police more and more ability to conduct surreptitious<br>
surveillance, to search properties and imprison people are increasing by <br>
leaps and bounds every year -- such is "police statism" by definition. <br>
<p>
I will submit to you that as these expanded police powers are not matters <br>
of conjecture,  but are matters of fact,  that to suggest that it is<br>
"paranoid" to define such rapid and constant expansions of police power <br>
as "police statism" is contradicted absolutely by the facts. It is more<br>
a question of do you care or not -- I do, it seems you don't.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, to suggest that defining police statism as a "disease" is <br>
paranoid (if indeed that's what you suggest) is also unwarranted; yet, <br>
it is a matter of subjective interpretation: those who value the crushing<br>
effects of excessive police -- i.e., governmental -- controls will not <br>
define a police state as a disease. <br>
<p>
As to the question of whether or not the expansion of police state <br>
powers is leading to excessive-police brutality, I suggest you examine <br>
the evidence you deleted. For example, the FLIR video of the events at <br>
Waco on April 19, 1993 provide compelling evidence, to say the least, <br>
that federal-police forces massacred women and children in cold blood <br>
as they attempted to escape the fire that the same video indicates was <br>
set by the FBI.  Dr. Edward F. Allard, an FLIR expert, gives us his <br>
expert analysis of the many muzzle flashes seen on the video: <br>
<p>
        There is no natural explanation for these flashes.<br>
        Natural phenomena do not heat and cool in fractions <br>
        of a second. My expert opinion is that these flashes <br>
        appear to be the muzzle flashes of a fully automatic <br>
        firearm, firing at about 500 rounds per minute cyclic <br>
        rate. Carefully examined, in slow motion and by frame-<br>
        to-frame observation, the flashes originate to the left<br>
        and progress to the right, indicating that they are <br>
        being fired from a source outside the building, and <br>
        fired into the building. <br>
<p>
I have myself seen the FLIR video. I was amazed at the certainty with <br>
which one can determine that these are muzzle flashes. In one case you <br>
can even see heat radiate from the spent-cartridge discharger on the <br>
side of the firearm, which I appears to be a large M-60 machine gun.<br>
<p>
I cannot imagine that anyone could define the cold-blooded slaughter and <br>
burning to death of innocent women and children as anything but the worst<br>
expression of police statism. Even more than the FLIR, pathologists who <br>
did autopsies in the Waco case blame many deaths on the FBI tanks that <br>
plowed deep inside the building. See my web page that covers Waco for <br>
more details on this: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/facts.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/facts.htm</a><br>
<p>
Waco, while a most horrific example, is but a subset of a wider less<br>
overwhelmingly aggressive, yet all-pervasive assault by the State on the<br>
liberties, properties, and freedom of the American people. Every person <br>
sitting in a prison for a victimless crime is a victim of police statism. <br>
Every business shut down by regulators or prevented from ever existing <br>
due to onerous regulation and taxation are victims of police statism. <br>
<p>
We can try to define police statism out of existence if we choose -- but <br>
we do so at our own peril. I realize that in accord with the Extropian <br>
principle of Dynamic Optimism, awareness of police brutality is discouraged <br>
even to the point that those who seek to raise awareness are tarred as<br>
"paranoid," i.e., mentally defective. I believe that excessive optimism <br>
can be as, or perhaps even more, detrimental to our future as a nation <br>
than excessive paranoia, which, short of proving that police powers are<br>
decreasing, that Waco was not a massacre, etc... has not even been <br>
demonstrated to be the case here. <br>
<p>
I encourage people to examine the evidence against the ever-growing State. <br>
I submit that no case against Statism is complete minus a careful analysis <br>
of its crimes against the people. I submit further that cataloging these <br>
crimes is not a mental dysfunction, as we are encouraged believe by the<br>
statist majority, but is an invaluble service to the future of <br>
freedom and human progress.<br>
