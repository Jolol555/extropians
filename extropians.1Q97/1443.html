Omega wrote 1/27/97: &lt;Actually Cramer's transactional interpretation does<br>
not necessarily imply non-locality so much as the fact that local causal<br>
principles propagate (on themicrocausal level) symmetrically<br>
bidirectionally through time....  [P]hilosopher Huw Price in his book<br>
'Time's Arrow and Archimedes Point' also makes the point that the<br>
temporally symmetrical bidirectional causality on the microcausal level<br>
could also have been anticipated by some of the problems Boltzmann was<br>
having with his work...&gt;<br>
<p>
This makes little sense to me.  What makes sense is "the fact that local<br>
causal principles propagate (on the microcausal level) asymmetrically<br>
bidirectionally through time."  There are more propagational degrees of<br>
freedom in the future than in the past, not in the energy/space aspect of<br>
existence but in the matter/time aspect.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;The big question in my mind, and area of greatest interest, is<br>
what... is going on in macrocausality.&gt;<br>
<p>
The question is the same one that Plato posed, where does coherency and<br>
intelligibility come from?  David Lindley's "Where Does the Weirdness Go?"<br>
(1996) and David Wick's "The Infamous Boundary" (1995) both delve into this<br>
crucial question of how we get from the small to the big.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;...such a world is one in which microcausality is hopelessly lost,<br>
which for me, is about as illogical as we can get.&gt;<br>
<p>
John Clark: &lt;I know of no law of logic the demands that every event have a<br>
cause.&gt;<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;Technically I would agree, BUT such a statement amounts to a<br>
sweeping and profound metaphysical statement.&gt;<br>
<p>
Having been on a fruitless trip to the ontological cellar with John C.<br>
before, and finding that I'm in agreement with your first statement, I<br>
would like to reiterate that:<br>
<p>
a) I have never seen a rational case made for information as an ontological<br>
primitive, the knowing entity always gets dumped;<br>
<p>
b) I have never seen a rational case made for the current physics<br>
group-think "paradigm" of Big Bang (creation ex nihilo) to random activity<br>
(QM) to Big Crunch (or Heat Death, take your pick), everything gets dumped.<br>
<p>
The current metaphysical presupposition of orthodox physics can be<br>
characterized as: from nothing in the beginning, to nothing in the middle,<br>
to nothing in the end.  (The concept "randomness" has utility within<br>
mathematical semantic technology but, of course, has no meaning<br>
ontologically.)  Perhaps "group-think" physicists lack imagination as well<br>
as reason.  They certainly don't lack emotions, however, witness the howls<br>
of rage over the SSC being cancelled, they get emotional when Uncle Sam<br>
tells them they can't play in taxpayer-funded sandboxes.<br>
