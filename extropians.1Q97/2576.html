<i>&gt;         &gt;prediction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt; I ask the computer program: "Suppose you decided to search for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; smallest even number greater than 4 that is not the sum of two primes  </i><br>
<i>&gt; (ignoring 1 and 2) and then stop. Would you ever stop?"</i><br>
<p>
It says, "You bet I would.  I'd get bored after only a few numbers.<br>
I've got better things to do with my time!"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;In principle, a person with access to an accurate neural-level</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;description of his brain could do so as well [...] Would people's</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;ability to answer such questions imply that they don't have free</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;will? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The electronic computer is much faster than my old steam powered biological </i><br>
<i>&gt; brain, so it figures out in 10 seconds what I'm going to do in 10 minutes, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but if the computer then tells me of it's prediction about me, and my  </i><br>
<i>&gt; personality is such that out of pure meanness I always do the opposite of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; what somebody tells me to do, then the prediction is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
No, the prediction is right.  This was the main point of my earlier mail.<br>
The prediction was of what you would do given situation X.  When you do<br>
something different, you are not in situation X, but situation Y, where<br>
Y = X plus the knowledge of what the prediction was.<br>
<p>
You can make a trivial computer program which reads a number and outputs<br>
the next number.  Now we will try to predict what it will type next.<br>
We input our prediction and see what it types.  Our prediction is<br>
always wrong!  No matter what we input, it outputs something different.<br>
<p>
This is not an example of free will by any reasonable criterion.  The<br>
fact that a system's behavior is a function of its inputs means that<br>
many, many systems will behave differently if one of their inputs is a<br>
prediction about their behavior.  Such a trait is totally irrelevant to<br>
any discussion of free will, because so many systems which no one would<br>
claim have free will have this property, as well as systems that people<br>
do claim have free will.<br>
<p>
So I don't see that the fact that a person will behave differently given<br>
a prediction of his behavior is at all relevant to questions of free will.<br>
<p>
If you had a box which had a simulation of your mind which ran faster<br>
than your own, then you could always find out what you were going<br>
to do before you did it.  Would the existence of such a box make you<br>
doubt your own free will?  Wouldn't it be strange to always have this<br>
box around which knew exactly what you were going to do ahead of time?<br>
I would find that it would make me question how "free" I really am.<br>
