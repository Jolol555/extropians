The questions and examples mix producer prices and consumer prices. <br>

 I don't know of any statistic methods (perhaps some form of knot <br>

&lt;Obviously you need to put a dollar sign on the intangible value of <br>
staying alive.&gt;<br>
<p>
Inflation indexes, and other economic indicators, can't very well <br>
include intangible values and still have much usefulness. <br>
 Furthermore, once you do admit such subjectivity into these things, <br>
they're immediately subject to political hijacking. That's not to say <br>
you wouldn't want to have some estimate of the value of staying alive <br>
to incorporate into whatever process you use to make some decision, <br>
you just wouldn't want to embed it in what are supposed to be fairly <br>
objective measures of marketplace trends.<br>
<p>
&lt;Once again we are dealing with material goods rather than <br>
informational goods, so its still out of the issue. Back to megs and <br>
bauds, you use Moore's laws [Snip] you see that there is significant <br>
deflation in high technolgies due to technological advancement, and <br>
the synergies of feeding every new gain into attaining greater gains, <br>
maintaining a 100% rate increase in productivity every 18  months.&gt;<br>
<p>
Mike, you're really talking about productivity here.  I agree, the <br>
national productivity measures we have are ridiculous, totally <br>
unsuited for measuring service-sector productivity, let alone the even <br>
more abstract knowledge industries.  The following is from a Wall <br>
Street Journal article of August 12, 1992 called 'Dubious Figures: <br>
Productivity Statistics For the Service Sector May Understate gains":<br>
<p>
"Explaining why productivity in many services is 'simply impossible to <br>
measure', Michael Harper, chief of productivity research at the Bureau <br>
of Labor Statistics, cites the insurance industry. 'Do higher <br>
premiums, which tend to boost an insurance company's revenues, also <br>
serve to boost its productivity,' he asks. 'Or are higher premiums <br>
merely a signal of higher policy risks.'"<br>
<p>
Note how important insurance services are to the type of libertarian <br>
society we hope to create.  The WSJ article also goes on to note:<br>
<p>
"Other services whose productivity the BLS finds impossible to measure <br>
include such major fields as health care, real estate, and stock and <br>
bond brokerage. In all, services for which no productivity figures are <br>
available employ nearly 70% of the people with service jobs - far <br>
higher than the comparable percentage in manufacturing."<br>
<p>
Other good example of productivity paradoxes include schools and <br>
day-care centers where an increase in students per teacher looks like <br>
a productivity increase but often results in a quality decrease.<br>
<p>
&lt;Given this unaccounted for deflation [in cost per baud], it is easy <br>
to see why the only thing contributing to inflation is COLA payments <br>
by the government union and pension system that are based on false <br>
inflation data from the government.&gt;<br>
<p>
COLA payments for government-employee pensions are miniscule compared <br>
to the COLA payments to Social Security recipients in the general <br>
public.<br>
<p>
Also, maybe you didn't check out the cartoon URL I provided but the <br>
point is that greater baud rates don't yet have much effect on the <br>
overall cost of living for most people.  According to the BLS Consumer <br>
Expenditure Survey (for 1991 - the quickest numbers I can get my hands <br>
on), average expenditures (based on a weighted sample by age-group, <br>
income-group and area) for the typical consumer are:<br>
<p>
14.1%    food<br>
31.2%    housing<br>
5.9%      apparel and services<br>
17.4%    transportation<br>
5.2%      health care<br>
5.0%      entertainment<br>
9.4%      personal insurances and pensions<br>
11.5%    other expenditures<br>
<p>
&lt;Are your superiors so incredulous or adamant against acknowledging <br>
the validity of this deflation due to the fact that they are trying to <br>
protect their pensions?&gt;<br>
<p>
The inflation you identified has to do with producer prices, which <br>
don't always translate into changes in consumer prices, nor do they <br>
have anything to do with the bulk of the average person's monthly <br>
bill.  As I noted, the biggest constituency against adjusting <br>
inflation measures downward are the elderly in general who want their <br>
Social Security COLAs.<br>
<p>
&lt;If it is acknowledged that there really isnt as much inflation as <br>
they claim, then the government will not be able to jack up taxes&gt;<br>
<p>
The second biggest constituency (in terms of how important it is to <br>
them), is the middle class, because the CPI is used to adjust their <br>
tax brackets - the higher the rate of inflation, the lower the tax <br>
bracket you fall into if your income is unchanged.<br>
<p>
You are right that technological advances have had  huge unmeasured <br>
impacts on manufacturing and service productivity.  So why are costs <br>
still increasing, even if at a lower rate than the official figures? <br>
 Well, I suspect that businesses like to keep their productivity <br>
improvements as proprietary information and, in fact, the currently <br>
'low' rate of inflation is a proxy for the fact that businesses don't <br>
have to raise their prices so much because of the productivity <br>
improvements they've been able to make in recent years.<br>
