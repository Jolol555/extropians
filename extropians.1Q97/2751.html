<i>&gt; Yes, of course part of what brings us together is an interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalist type political institutions. But why are so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of you so damn confident that you know how such things would actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; function, or which minute variation would actually be best?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; [RH]</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I have no confidence at all that it would "function" or<br>
which one would be "best" (by my standards, which I /do/ have a<br>
clear idea of :).<br>
<p>
But since no existing system of government "functions", and no<br>
system in history ever has, what is there to lose but the tyranny<br>
we know so well?  Since there is no direct evidence of a functioning<br>
government, we have no recourse but reason from axiomatic values<br>
to determine a system that best fits them, and work toward that.<br>
When we have that working, and we can see its flaws that we might<br>
not have anticipated, we can fix them as well.<br>
<p>
It's not that I have confidence in anarcho-capitalism; it's just<br>
that I have utter contempt for everything else so far proposed.<br>
