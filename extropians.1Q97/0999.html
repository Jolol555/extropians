<i>&gt; That's pretty much what I would expect from Shaun Russell.  I would </i><br>
<i>&gt; expect better from Eliezer, but when the dogma of equality is challenged,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; apparently even he is eager to reduce himself to the same level as Shaun.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; What happened to those fine proclamations about Truth? -- "I think that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the truth takes precedence over anyone's feelings, including my own."  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Never mind.  </i><br>
<p>
I visited Hugo de Garis's page.  I did not see a list of scientific<br>
studies supporting his assertion.  I saw an emotional argument for male<br>
supremacy, based on self-righteousness.  The only scientifically<br>
interesting part was the bit about SAT scores.<br>
<p>
So, as you quoted, I responded to the assertion about SAT scores with my<br>
own assertion that the SAT wasn't a valid measurement of genius or even<br>
intelligence, backed up by my ludicrous scores.  The remainder of the<br>
letter was an attempt to render untenable the "I, a male, am thus at the<br>
top of the hierarchy HA HA HA!" that I believe provides the emotional<br>
power of the male-superiority meme.  If I'd had the time, I would also<br>
have launched an attack at the male "screw-anything-that-moves" and<br>
"wives-are-property" emotions, but from reading his web page I deemed<br>
these to be secondary.<br>
<p>
And as for my fine proclamations about truth - and that's a small 't',<br>
Lyle! - *if* you can *prove* that no male can be a "genius", I'll force<br>
that sad predicament of 47% of known sentient beings into my belief<br>
system, regardless of how much damage it does along the way, and add to<br>
my intelligence-amplification list a way to bring male genius up to<br>
female standards.  My actions will be similar if a someone proves that<br>
no woman can be a genius.<br>
