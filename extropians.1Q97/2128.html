I wasn't being harsh.  There's a lot of good recommendations (extra of most<br>
vitamins, keep fat and calories down, plenty of trace minerals, etc.)  But<br>
the the original poster requested superlatives ("best", "optimal" "most<br>
efficient") and that is most definitely not to be had.  All this stuff is<br>
most tentative.  Remember the results of the long-term beta carotene studies?<br>
 Surprise!<br>

<i>&gt;CR looks promising, but it is most likely very hard to turn directly from </i><br>
<i>&gt;a normal diet to a CR diet; instead it is most likely a good idea to </i><br>
<i>&gt;first starte eating healthy low-calorie food, and once you have made that </i><br>
<i>&gt;a habit move towards CR. A direct jump is bound to lead to hunger and </i><br>
<i>&gt;motivation problems. </i><br>
<p>
The best way to succeed in CR is a *completely* open question.  I'm not aware<br>
of one whit of research in how different methods compare in effectiveness.<br>
 Animal models are useless as the animals can't make informed decisions; they<br>
must be forced to eat less.  <br>
