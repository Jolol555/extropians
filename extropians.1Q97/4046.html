<i>&gt;&gt; ZPF is "known" science. I suggest you do a websearch for Dr. H. E.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Puthoff. He and Raisch are working at Lockheed on developing practical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; applications of the ZPF...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Funny how none of those pages mention that he's the same Dr. Puthoff</i><br>
<i>&gt;who claimed that Uri Geller was a genuine clairvoyant, /after/ his</i><br>
<i>&gt;studies with Targ had been debunked by CSICOP.  He might be right </i><br>
<i>&gt;this time, but given his reputation of being about as credible as</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fleishman and Pons, I want to see it done by someone else first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
CSICOP are themselves about as credible as the above mentioned accused. They<br>
are more interested in maintaining their DOGMA (early 20th century scientific<br>
understanding) than in finding the truth. They have repeatedly refused to<br>
publish ANY papers that might suggest there are "psi" phenomona at work. For a<br>
scathing critique of CSICOP I suggest you read Robert Anton Wilson's "New<br>
Inquistion".<br>
<p>
As far as Puthoff is concerned, he has published several papers regarding ZPF<br>
and the Casimir effect in "Physics A" - a conservative journal if there ever<br>
was one.<br>
<p>
Regarding Flieshman and Pons, their only mistake was bad Public Relations. The<br>
verdict is not out yet on cold fusion - there are still too many experiments<br>
acheiving anomolous results and excess energy. Every so called critic of cold<br>
fusion I've heard so far has yet to present solid unrefutable evidence to the<br>
contrary.<br>
