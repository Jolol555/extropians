The problem with socialism is that it often limits economic growth, as well<br>
as individual freedom. While i'm by no means an absolute/complete<br>
anarchist, and free market capitalist. 'Forcing' people into being<br>
altuistic, like it is being done today, is not my idea of an ideal society<br>
either. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although I agree with the other principles of extropianism, I</i><br>

<i>&gt;social programs such as secondary and post-secondary education that we</i><br>

<i>&gt;idyllic society of equality, for extropianism, it is an idyllic society of</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom.</i><br>
<p>
Actually i just noted in the other thread that i assumed extropianism<br>
believes in the old liberal/humanist idea that people will automatically do<br>
what is good for them, and that this itself will bring benefit to society<br>
as a whole.  <br>
<p>
My point excactly was that the more education people receive, the better<br>
they will be able to do so. A system like they propose *could* go spiraling<br>
down in a few generations, if there is no coordination, there is no<br>
guarantee that it will, but there is no guarantee that it won't. Problem is<br>
to find a form of coordination (a social contract if you will) which still<br>
leaves complete individual freedom intact. Extropianism suggests a<br>
completely voluntary system, which i believe in. Just not with the same<br>
kind of blind optimism that the system will take care of itself, of some of<br>
the other people on this list. <br>
<p>
It's funny to be on the other side once, defending the ideas of the people<br>
i normally 'criticize'. But i think you'll find a great difference here in<br>
'degrees' to which people believe in this system. And as they told me when<br>
i joined, 'you don't have to be a libertarian in order to be an extropian'.<br>
My experience is you automatically become a moderate libertarian when you<br>
stay on this list long enough ;-) <br>
<p>
I also wonder how many of the individualists here call themselves 'true'<br>
extropians. How the hell do you organise individualists or anarchists ?.<br>
Maybe it's like in that monty python movie 'life of brian' when brian says:<br>
don't follow me: 'you are all individuals', and the crowd replies<br>
simultaneously: 'Yes we are all individuals!' We're individualists, yet we<br>
all seem to have flocked together on this list, instead of mailing to<br>
eachother via our own lists, which you should expect from ultra-<br>
individualists really. It makes us a rather bizarre, but all the more<br>
interesting 'collective'. :-)<br>
