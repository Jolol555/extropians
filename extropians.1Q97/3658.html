Back in March of '95, I posted critiques of Sir Karl Popper's alleged key<br>
characteristic of the scientific method, his propositional falsifiability<br>
principle.  The thread was "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" and the<br>
absolutely fatal criticism of Popper's principle was drawn from Elliott<br>
Sober's "Philosophy of Biology" (1993).  Roger Kimball has written an essay<br>
about an Australian philosopher, entitled "Who Was David Stove?" in "The<br>
New Criterion" March 1997, who analytically ripped Popper and his epigoni<br>
to pieces.<br>
<p>
David Stove died in 1994, but has left behind some very interesting, but<br>
little known, books.  Kimball writes mostly about "Popper and After:  Four<br>
Modern Irrationalists" which was originally published in 1982 by Pergamon<br>
Press, but a new edition is being published by Macleay Press retitled as<br>
"Anything Goes:  Origins of the Cult of Scientific Irrationalism".  It<br>
looks like a doozy for all die-hard Popper fans.  Stove also wrote "Cricket<br>
Versus Republicanism" (a collection of very politically incorrect essays<br>
published posthumuously), "Darwinian Fairytales" (also published<br>
posthumuously, Darwinism's absurdities highlighted between the boundaries<br>
of human genetic vs. cultural evolution), "The Plato Cult and Other<br>
Philosophical Essays" (1991) (seven essays attacking philosophical<br>
idealism), "Rationality of Induction" (1986), and "Probability and Hume's<br>
Inductive Skepticism" (1973).<br>
<p>
I am quoting Kimball's account of Stove's critique of Popper:<br>
<p>
  "The long struggle of empiricism since Bacon had yielded a<br>
straightforward but powerful conception of science.  Scientific<br>
propositions were distinguished from speculative or pseudo-scientific<br>
propositions by the degree to which they were verifiable; the method of<br>
science was essentially inductive, which means that it moved from the<br>
observed or known to the unobserved or unknown; the procedures of science<br>
were marked by caution; its results were held to be certain or at least<br>
highly probable."<br>
<p>
Stove's technical specialty within philosophy was induction, Popper's<br>
speciality was deduction.  These two don't mix well, probably something to<br>
do with New Age Harmonic Divergence.<br>
<p>
  "Popper stood all this on its head.  In his philosophy of science, we<br>
find the curious thought that falsifiability, not verifiability, is the<br>
distinguishing mark of scientific theories; this means that, for Popper,<br>
one theory is better than another if it is more disprovable than the other.<br>
 Popper was apparently fond of referring to 'the soaring edifice of<br>
science.'  But in fact his philosophy of science robbed that edifice of its<br>
foundation.  Refracted through the lens of Popper's theories, the history<br>
of modern science is transformed from a dazzling string of successes into a<br>
series of 'problems' or 'conjectures and refutations.'  On the traditional<br>
view, scientific knowledge can be said to be *cumulative*:  we know more<br>
now than we did in 1897, more then than in 1697.  Popper's theory, demoting<br>
scientific laws to mere guesses, denies this:  in one of his most famous<br>
phrases, he speaks of science as 'conjectural knowledge,' an oxymoronic gem<br>
that, as Stove remarks, makes as much sense as 'a drawn game which was<br>
won.'"<br>
<p>
It gets worse.<br>
<p>
  "...Popper's ideas did not only propound an irrationalist view of<br>
science:  they also helped to *license* irrationalism for an entire<br>
generation.  Without the bedrock - or, rather, the sandbank - of Popper's<br>
theories upon which to build, the other philosophers of science Stove<br>
discusses - Imre Lakatos, Thomas Kuhn, and Paul Feyerabend - could never<br>
have developed their own influential permutations of irrationalism.  And<br>
without the example of these and other such gentlemen, the blasé<br>
irrationalism that infects the humanities and social sciences today - and,<br>
indeed, that infects our entire 'postmodern' culture - might never have<br>
achieved epidemic proportions.  Kuhn's famous book "The Structure of<br>
Scientific Revolutions" (1962), which in effect denies that there is such a<br>
thing as progress in science, has by itself done incalculable intellectual<br>
damage to innumerable professors looking for excuses to deny the claims of<br>
scientific truth."<br>
<p>
Obviously the spread of irrationalism was extremely rapid, because<br>
scientific authority lays claim to a political monopoly on all authority. <br>
Our Western democratic governments were founded on the notion of<br>
rationality derived from the Enlightenment.  Science is largely government<br>
funded.  Science must maintain its corner on being the sole authority on<br>
what is to be labelled rationality.  If science loses its monopoly on this<br>
authority, the particular form of government that feeds it loses its<br>
authority, jeodarizing science's food supply.  Once a philosopher moves the<br>
herd of state scientists in a different direction, stragglers are cut out<br>
and picked off.  The herd has learned to move right smartly en masse,<br>
survival of the fattest.<br>
<p>
  "Irrationalism, to be plausible, must be disguised, and Stove devotes the<br>
first half of his book to a brilliant analysis of the literary devices used<br>
to achieve plausibility.  There are two basic techniques.  The first is to<br>
neutralize what Stove calls 'success words' ­ words like 'knowledge,'<br>
'discovery,' 'facts,' 'verified,' 'explanation.'  Such words carry an<br>
implication of cognitive achievement.  No philosopher of science can do<br>
without them entirely.  But the simple addition of scare quotes alters<br>
everything:  'Galileo discovers x' means something quite different from<br>
'Galileo "discovers" x.'  The element of ambiguity is essential:  consider<br>
the effect of a sign advertising "fresh" fish.  The same trick can<br>
obviously be used with words of cognitive failure:  'mistake,' 'false,'<br>
'refuted,' etc.  A "refuted" theory is not the same as a refuted theory."<br>
<p>
  "The second technique involves deliberately conflating the history or<br>
sociology of science with the logic of science.  Stove focuses especially<br>
on what he calls 'sabotaging logical expressions.'  By embedding a logical<br>
statement in a historical context, one thereby undermines its logical<br>
status while preserving the impression  that a logical claim has been made.<br>
 A simple example is the difference between 'P entails Q' and 'P entails Q<br>
according to most logicians.'  The first is a logical statement; the second<br>
is a historical claim; it is what Stove calls a 'ghost logical statement': <br>
it poaches on the prestige of logical entailment without actually making<br>
any logical claim at all:  it is therefore completely immune to criticism<br>
on logical grounds."<br>
<p>
Immunity to criticism on logical grounds is a very powerful memetic tool,<br>
as long as the rubes don't see the trick.<br>
<p>
  "Stove's analysis of how his authors manage to make their irrationalism<br>
plausible to their readers is a tour de force.  So is his analysis of how<br>
they made irrationalism plausible to themselves.  The key, at least so far<br>
as Popper was concerned, was the challenge to Newtonian physics by<br>
relativity and quantum mechanics.  As Stove points out, this 'changed the<br>
entire climate of philosophy of science,' replacing the nineteenth<br>
century's blissful confidence about the impregnable certainty of science<br>
with a profound skepticism."<br>
<p>
Radical skepticism is indistinguishable from nihilism.<br>
<p>
  "Stove shows how Popper and his other authors, attempting 'to ensure that<br>
no scientific theory should ever again become the object of over-confident<br>
belief,' overreacted and embraced instead a form of irrationalism whose<br>
philosophical roots go back to Hume.  At bottom, Stove shows, his authors<br>
embrace irrationalism because of 'a certain extreme belief, by which their<br>
minds are dominated, about what is required for one proposition to be a<br>
reason to believe another.'  They all acknowledge that absolute certainty<br>
is impossible; but they assume that only absolute certainty will do as a<br>
warrant for rational belief."<br>
<p>
I can't begin to count how many posts have been devoted to quibbling over<br>
"certainty" on this list.  I hope certain individuals are taking this<br>
critique to heart.  ;)<br>
<p>
  "They exhibit, in other words, 'a variety of perfectionism.'  It is, of<br>
course, a disappointed perfectionism.  Disappointed perfectionism has also<br>
led to 'the frivolous elevation of 'the critical attitude' into a<br>
categorical imperative.'  The principle result, as Stove notes, has been<br>
'to fortify millions of ignorant graduates and undergraduates in the<br>
belief, to which they are already too firmly wedded by other causes, that<br>
the adversary posture is all, and that intellectual life consists in<br>
'directionless quibble.''<br>
<p>
Ha ha!  I like this guy!  If authoritative science proclaims that no<br>
purpose and no meaning are anywhere to be found in the universe, then of<br>
course, intellectual life must, by scientific definition, consist of<br>
'directionless quibble.'  I call this stance 'smug nihilism.'  I wonder how<br>
science itself escapes being 'directionless quibble'?  Could it be that<br>
scientific laws don't apply to scientists themselves?  Why are scientists<br>
so hungry for other people's money all the time if they are really just a<br>
collection of random fluctuations of nothing?<br>
