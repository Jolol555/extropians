Sorry about being a bit tardy on this reply.<br>

There's actually a ready made constituency for this one. Check out <br>
alt.fan.furry sometime. The fans of anthropomorphic animals there are <br>
quite keen on the idea of morphing themselves into the body types of <br>
their choice. At least one I know of has gone into biochem/genetics<br>
just for this reason. Nanotech is a recurring theme of discussion<br>
and fan written fiction in the newsgroup. They already have discussions<br>
on the ethics of morphing yourself, and the much more controversial issue<br>
of genetically altering your children before birth to a given not completely<br>
human form.<br>
Given the technology to do this, there would be enthusiastic participation<br>
from some in that group, and a wide variety of forms experimented with.<br>
<p>
On the slightly tamer side of things, for those interested in animals and<br>
animal behavior, directly interfacing to the brain of a target animal, and<br>
recording the sensations/behavior/emotions etc, then replaying it into the<br>
mind via a direct interface could be a revolution in understanding animal<br>
behavior. Doing this with humans to create either direct links or just<br>
recording and playing back would open up a lot in behavioral studies<br>
(and make a hell of a lot of people very nervous).<br>
