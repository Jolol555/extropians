In a message dated 97-01-05 22:51:49 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; After a month or two a man wearing a suite will knock <br>
 on my door  and tell me that because of my failure to pay back taxes my<br>
house<br>
 now belongs  to the U.S. Government and I have 20 minutes to leave the area.<br>
<p>
 I tell the nice man that I like my house and don't intend to leave. After an<br>
<p>
 hour or two several clean cut young men wearing body armor and carrying <br>
 submachine guns from the SWAT team knock down my door.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
???<br>
I know so many people who owe 5 to 50k or more, and they never EVER had<br>
soldiers with submachine guns at the door (Oh yes, they have endured some<br>
shitty things, believe me, like waking up one day with zero in the bank, no<br>
credit, not being able to have a checking account, or use their own name for<br>
phones - that kind of stuff) . I do not assume that left unchecked, in our<br>
time, the kind of thing you are describing could happen-  and does, I assume,<br>
but my humble, artist experience it is not reality. <br>
<p>
But if one had the Libertarian govt. Socialism could exist without government<br>
and it would be voluntary IMO. I would not so choose, but I allow others to<br>
choose such. <br>
<p>
<p>
                 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
My opinion of elections is nearly as low as my opinion of Governments.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
OK, so what is your alternative, your solution to how proper government comes<br>
into being? If you care about the rights of the inividual and are not<br>
propsoing outright  not anarchy, how does the inidivual choose<br>
representatives? <br>
