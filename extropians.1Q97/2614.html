<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would agree that counting these things is better than not counting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This doesn't help that much though. I'll try to give two examples.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.   Let's try to compute inflation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose the following goods were sold in the following years:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                  1980                 1997</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;            Quantity  price,      Quantity   price,</i><br>
<i>&gt;              sold     each         sold      each</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bicycles      1       $100        1         $200</i><br>
<i>&gt; Megs          1       $100        1000      $0.20</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bauds         -         -         56K       $0.001</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose the quality doesn't change (ha-ha).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Inflation on bicycles: about 4% a year</i><br>
<i>&gt; Inflation on Megs:     about -40% a year.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Inflation on Bauds:    ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, more interesting:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Inflation on bicycles AND Megs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Method 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  A 1980 typical basket of 1 bike +1 meg costs $200 in 1980</i><br>
<i>&gt; and $200.2 in 1996.   Inflation = 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  On the other hand, a typical 1997 basket of 1 bike and 1000 megs</i><br>
<i>&gt; in 1997 cost $400, and would have cost $100,000 in 1980.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Inflation about -40% a year.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So which basket should we count?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; - and this all for the same goods of the same quality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now add bauds to the picture. And Netscape. And 60 million web pages</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can look through. And ideas on architectures of complex systems that</i><br>
<i>&gt; appeared while people were building all of these.  Still, these things</i><br>
<i>&gt; are just resources - and you can do use them to produce results that</i><br>
<i>&gt; were not even in anybody's imagination in 1980.  And those *results*</i><br>
<i>&gt; are the things you want to count.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  Another economic problem: a breast cancer patient had to pay $5000</i><br>
<i>&gt; for painful treatment and a coffin in 1980, and $20,000 in 1997 - for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; (painless) treatment only. The coffin doubled in price, but it is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer needed, as the patient now survives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  What is the inflation rate here?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Obviously you need to put a dollar sign on the intangible value of<br>
staying alive. Perhaps this is only an apparent change. You forgot to<br>
include the gains due to collection of life insurance. Your market<br>
basket death benefit will range from $10,000 up to $1,000,000. Once<br>
again we are dealing with material goods rather than informational<br>
goods, so its still out of the issue. <br>
<p>
Back to megs and bauds, you use Moore's laws to estimate what the<br>
typical rate of consumption was for a given unit at a given point in<br>
time. In 1990, 2400 baud modems were the norm, 18 months later, 4800,<br>
then 9600 18 months after that, then onto 14.4, 28.8, and now 56k. Using<br>
these rates of consumption, with the attendant cost per baud, you see<br>
that there is significant deflation in high technolgies due to<br>
technological advancement, and the synergies of feeding every new gain<br>
into attaining greater gains, maintaining a 100% rate increase in<br>
productivity every 18  months.<br>
<p>
1990      2400baud /$200 = $.08/baud<br>
1991.5    4800baud /$200 = $.04/baud<br>
1993      9600baud /$200 = $.02/baud<br>
1994     14,400baud /$200 = $.01333/baud<br>
1995    19,600baud /$200 = $.01/baud<br>
1996	28,800baud /$200 = $.00666/baud<br>
1997	56,000baud /$200 = $.00333/baud<br>
<p>
Given this unaccounted for deflation, it is easy to see why the only<br>
thing contributing to inflation is COLA payments by the government union<br>
and pension system that are based on false inflation data from the<br>
government.<br>
<p>
It is also easy to see why human productivity is increasing for the<br>
first time in 30 years, graphical interfaces that are easy to use for<br>
the majority of the population increase one's effective intelligence,<br>
effectiveness, and overall productivity.<br>
<p>
Are your superiors so incredulous or adamant against acknowledging the<br>
validity of this deflation due to the fact that they are trying to<br>
protect their pensions? Are they afraid that if they acknowledge that<br>
there has been real deflation in the economy, that the people will<br>
demand that they get their tax dollars back? If it is acknowledged that<br>
there really isnt as much inflation as they claim, then the government<br>
will not be able to jack up taxes, which is stupid, because if they drop<br>
the inflation rate to its true level, our budget deficit problem will<br>
dissapear within a few years as the interest payments we make on the<br>
debt are lowered to compensate.<br>
