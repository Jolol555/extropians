Lee Daniel Crocker declared, "If "politeness" dilutes the message, then to <br>
hell with it.  If you can be polite /and/ get your message across, so much the <br>
better. But the message comes first."<br>
<p>
I understand what you mean, but consider:  to *communicate* a message, the <br>
minds you wish to communicate with must be receptive to what you have to say.  <br>
If they're not open to what you are saying, then you will end up *saying* your <br>
"message", but it has no real effect, because it is not transfered to another <br>
mind; so it is not really a message after all, since there is no communication <br>
going on.<br>
<p>
I have experimented with many different communication styles, to try to share <br>
my messages with others, to influence their minds to think about the world in <br>
closer to the same way I do.  My ideas, when stated baldly, are deeply <br>
subversive to the current ways of thinking and acting.  If I do not dilute my <br>
messages with other people's belief systems, the ideas seem too foreign and <br>
hostile, and people tend to react vigorously against what I am saying.  So <br>
what I have to do is understand their belief systems well enough that I can <br>
state my messages *within their belief system*, so that it sounds good and <br>
agreeable *from the standpoint of their belief system*.  Of course, much is <br>
lost in the translation, but without the translation, all would be lost.<br>
<p>
Also, being nice and polite tends to cause people to open their minds to me; <br>
they tend to tell me more of their thoughts, and they listen more carefully to <br>
what I am saying.  I try not to seem threatening at all to people's belief <br>
systems; in fact I design my phrases so that their belief systems will have no <br>
choice but to embrace what I say.  Generally, people are nodding their heads, <br>
going "Yeah, that's right!" as I keep giving them insights that make total <br>
sense, from within their belief system.  <br>
<p>
For example, to many theists, I never let on that I don't really believe in <br>
God.  In fact, I talk to them as though I *do* believe in God, and I tell them <br>
how God wants us to learn as much as we can and to improve ourselves as much <br>
as we can.  I often get into it more vigorously than their preacher does, <br>
explaining the scriptures and Jesus' purpose and His message, and they're just <br>
nodding their heads "Amen!", and their whole religion seems so much clearer to <br>
them, and they feel so good, and all the while I've been putting a subversive <br>
twist to their religion; I've turned their religion into something that wants <br>
them to excell in their lives and to understand their world better.  I get <br>
them so worked up and in such vigorous agreement, that they can't forget the <br>
message I gave them, because I've woven it right into their belief system.<br>
<p>
Politeness is just a good way to open the minds of your audience.<br>
