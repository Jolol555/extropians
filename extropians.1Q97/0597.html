<i>&gt;&gt;There is nothing that prevents us from forming other axioms</i><br>

 <br>
<i>&gt; That could be very dangerous, it might make your system too powerful,</i><br>

Of course, but that wasn't my point.  I was simply trying to show<br>
how specific, narrow, limited-application results are often misapplied<br>
as general principles.  Godel's is typical, as is Darwin's.  A few<br>
results of Chaos theory are possibly some of the few cases where a<br>
mathematical/scientific result actually does have general<br>
application in the real world.  While Godel does not really have any<br>
implications about the limits of human knowledge as was suggested at<br>
the start of this thread, and which I have tried to rebut, Chaos<br>
theory does indeed do a good job of explaining why we can't predict<br>
the weather.<br>
<p>
Adding arbitrary axioms to a logical system changes its ability to<br>
reflect "truth", but "truth" isn't a feature of logical systems.<br>
Logical systems can have the properties of "consistency" or<br>
"completeness", but not both.  That--AND ONLY THAT--is Godel's result.<br>
"Truth" is something else altogether: that's simply how we choose to<br>
use the logical system as a model of some physical reality.  Because<br>
such mappings of logic to reality are often useful, I would not<br>
recommend adding axioms arbitrarily except as an exercise.<br>
