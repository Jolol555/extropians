[Lyle Burkhead]<br>
<i>&gt; Language transparency has been a pet project of mine for a long time.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whoever gets there first holds the keys to the kingdom.  Rebuilding the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tower of Babel is the most important subject there is.  Rocket science </i><br>
<i>&gt; is insignificant by comparison.  </i><br>
<p>
There is a linguist, Anna Wierzbicka (now working at the Australian<br>
Natural University, <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au">http://www.anu.edu.au</a>), whose main project is to<br>
find a so-called "natural semantic metalanguage". This would be a<br>
minimal subset of a natural language in terms of which every<br>
meaningful utterance could in principle be expressed. To be validated,<br>
she says, the vocabulary and semantic rules of combination of the NSM<br>
should be found in some form in every language. This has been a<br>
multi-decade research project on her part...<br>
<p>
If the NSM theory is correct, it suggests to me that the best paradigm<br>
for machine translation (say from English into Russian) is to take<br>
your English text, translate it into English NSM, translate THAT into<br>
Russian NSM, and then translate that into idiomatic Russian.<br>
<p>
I'll have a page on the NSM at the URL below shortly.<br>
