<i>&gt;Conceivably we could eventually learn to rip a proto-arm off a &gt;cloned</i><br>
embryo, hook it up to a tiny little blood supply, and grow an &gt;arm, without<br>
growing the rest of the body. It's not clear that this &gt;would work, though.<br>
<p>
How about this: taking a cell from the stage where the embryo is just a<br>
ball of cells. Just take that specific cell that has the right anim./veg.<br>
levels to grow into an arm, or a part of the rump attached to an arm, (or<br>
organ). And hook these cells back up to the placenta (this may be the<br>
tricky part)  <br>
<p>
At one point we might even be able to manufacture cells with those right<br>
levels. They way i see it all we need to do is take one ball, split up all<br>
the cells, clone each cell, save the original and label it. Put each clone<br>
back on the placenta, and see what it grows into.<br>
<p>
It may all sound a little too simplistic to be accomplished, but then so<br>
did cloning sheep didn't it ?   <br>

<i>&gt;At the other extreme is the view that people have the right and duty</i><br>

<p>
I don't know, we use cows and pigs for leather, why not for a heart ?<br>
We've always 'guided' their evolution, the reason they exist in their<br>
current form, is purely because that current form has brought us benefit.<br>
As long as we don't make/let them suffer, i see no limitations for their<br>
uses.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The fear about mixing animal and human cells is the possibility of</i><br>

<p>
Hmmm, As long as we restrict experiments to domesticated species, we're<br>
going to benefit from the knowledge we already have on these species. It's<br>
also a perfect test comparison for the free market system: relatively 5% to<br>
10% of the human population (farmers) have been financing research into<br>
medical research for domesticated animals, which we have come quite a way<br>
in, through a free market system. Compared to the state system that dealt<br>
with human medical research. something to consider ?    <br>
<p>
You did bring up an interesting point though, which made me wonder about<br>
species-specific mutation rates, what exactly causes it, and the<br>
compatibility and possible influence, animal donor organs would have on<br>
humans.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is similar to the case of quarantining someone who has an &gt;infectious</i><br>
disease, one of the classic "hard cases" of &gt;libertarianism.<br>
<p>
only if carried to extremes, i hope you mean a lethal infectous disease,<br>
not a common cold that could COST another individual a doctors bill, and<br>
medication ?<br>
