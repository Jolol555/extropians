<p>
It's funny, because I was thinking the same thing... Check this excerpt<br>
out from their page...<br>
<p>
<p>
"It is clear to all of us, that to the Anti-Christ -- those propagators<br>
of sustained faithfulness to mammalian humanism -- we are, and will be<br>
seen as, their        Anti-Christ. This is certainly to be expected, and<br>
it will not delay our return to our<br>
Father's Kingdom. It might even accelerate that return."<br>
<p>
Now, to them, as far as I can tell, the Kingdom of Heaven(Father's<br>
Kingdom) is outer space.  Nothing like a little new age alien<br>
possession(which is what the whole foundation of their belief rests<br>
on...)  Anyways, notice, what they consider the anti-christ... <br>
"propagators of sustained faithfulness to mammalian humanism"  Hmm... <br>
It does sound a lot like corrupted extropian views.  I mean, biotech,<br>
cloning, and of course, the total body and genetic manipulation that we<br>
strive to obtain for ourselves.  <br>
<p>
wonder if anyone in their group has read extropian material?  Of course,<br>
this has me thinking about memes and such.  how do memes mutate?  This<br>
sure seems like an extropian meme merging with a new age meme...  I have<br>
a lot of reading to do on memes.  I wanna hear what my new age friend<br>
has to say about this one...  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It saddens me that these people failed to realise that the only gate to</i><br>
<i>&gt; "heaven" is one that *we* will create here on earth: the gate to</i><br>
<i>&gt; posthumanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are we not spreading the extropian memes enough, or what?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Maybe we're finally spreading them enough...  If non extropian people<br>
can use it...  But, perhaps we're not clear enough.  I think that the<br>
biggest reason memes mutate, is because some people are not open minded<br>
enough to totally see the full meme, but only part of it.  Extropianism<br>
is a large meme, as is any other, really...  My new age friend...(OK, I<br>
will admit something to you guys, I'm a Christian(gasp!)...)  Umm... <br>
When I talk to him about my personal beliefs of God, and what the basic<br>
principles of Christianity are, he mixes his new age preconceptions of<br>
God in with what I tell him.  Does this have to do with open<br>
mindedness?  I know we all have our own biases... But, when I hear a new<br>
meme, I try to look at it from a totally fresh perspective, without<br>
putting my own memetic influence on it.  Then, after I've learned enough<br>
about the subject, I start to mix my own memes with it...  But I try to<br>
understand something in it's pure form first.  Perhaps, I listen to a<br>
meme, and see if it's compatible with my belief system, and if it is, I<br>
alter it to fit conveniently into the puzzle of my mind.  Hmm...  sorry<br>
this has gone on to a lot of babble.  anyways, I'm still trying to fit<br>
the extropian meme into my christian worldview(and I know a lot of you<br>
might get very hostile for me even suggesting that such a thing can<br>
occur, or if it should.)  <br>
<p>
Anyways, gotta go...  <br>
<p>
peace,<br>
