<i>&gt; &gt; J. de Lyser is a social democrat along with more than 99% of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rest of the population of Europe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That we are, if you compare to american politics. But is it really so bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have social consience built into the society?</i><br>
<i>&gt; MAX M Rasmussen</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is.  "Social Conscience" assigns rights to an entity called<br>
"society" which deserves no rights, and takes them away from enities<br>
that do deserve them: individuals.  At the same time, it destroys<br>
individual responsiblity.  <br>
<p>
An eight-year-old can understand the difference between a set and its<br>
members; you cannot perform operations on one that you can on the other.<br>
A set of people is not a person.  A person has will, and can act for<br>
his own benefit.  When you create "society", and assign it rights, you<br>
have given rights to an entity with no means or will to exercise them,<br>
and no way to benefit from them.  Therefore, it must take from certain<br>
individuals and give to others, and cannot be held accountable for<br>
either.  Even its laudable goals such as helping the unfortunate wind<br>
up in the hands of faceless bureacracies blindly following rules, taking<br>
by force and doling out by formula.  Compassion at gunpoint is not<br>
human compassion.<br>
<p>
"Social Conscience" is an evil, not because its goals are evil, but<br>
because it does not--it cannot possibly--achieve those goals as well<br>
as individual rights and responsibility can.<br>
