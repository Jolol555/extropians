Moisture content has a very significant impact on shock propagation.<br>
Nuclear blasts in regions with a high water table exhibit shallower crater<br>
depth, but a significantly larger shock damage radius.  Water transmits<br>
shock much better than either air or dry soil.  However, this is mostly of<br>
concern to underground structures since ground shock propagation is their<br>
only significant threat other than overpressure.  For most structures,<br>
overpressure is the primary threat, not ground shock.<br>
<p>
FYI, as a rule, conventional explosives have a 50% greater damage radius<br>
underwater as they do in air due to differences in hydrostatic shock<br>
propagation efficiency.<br>
