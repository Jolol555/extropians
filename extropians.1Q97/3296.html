Eugene Leitl fowards a message from Howard Olsen:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Pandering to the worst reactionary authoritarian statist elements of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Millenium, Clinton seeks a "commission"  { an Inquisition is more</i><br>
<i>&gt;like it) to study human cloning.</i><br>
<p>
Saw the head of this commission on CSPAN yesterday.  He said they want<br>
90 days to study the question.  They will have lots of religious<br>
leaders on the commission, but he said it was very hard to find<br>
someone in favor of human cloning, but they'd try to dredge up<br>
someone.  If they publish an email address to send comments to, I hope<br>
someone posts it here.<br>
<p>
I am amazed and frightened by the strength of the reaction against<br>
cloning.  No concrete scenarios of anyone being harmed by cloning are<br>
being put forward!  All I've seen are complaints that people wanting<br>
cloned kids must be selfish and/or weird.  Everyone agrees on this and<br>
disagrees how concerns for this should weigh against the potential for<br>
medical research.  I fear for the future of self-modification, at<br>
least for a few decades.<br>

P.S.  Yes, this sort of thing is predicted as we approach a "Fourth Turning."<br>
