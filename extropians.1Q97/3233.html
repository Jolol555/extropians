&lt;Yes.  As a young nerd I was sure my social habits were the direct <br>

self-absorbed I was.  There was real social injustice I was reacting <br>
to, but that was not a good excuse.&gt;<br>

&lt;I have moved in the opposite direction.  When I was younger I engaged <br>
in a constant struggle against my natural introversion in order to <br>
meet people, make friends, etc.  I worked hard to overcome the "nerd" <br>
image, to fit in with ordinary people.  It was reasonably successful <br>
but it was very stressful for me.&gt;<br>

Sounds like ones' level of sociability is a rational function of ones' <br>
situation in society, and not genetic (oops, wrong thread (-;), <br>
although there could *also* be some genetic predisposition to being <br>
more or less introverted.<br>
<p>
Someone well established in a career with a secure position may not <br>
feel the need to be as sociable (assuming they're not in public <br>
relations, marketing or management) as someone just starting out and <br>
trying to make the right contacts.  On the other hand, they may later <br>
decide that their position is not so secure after all and they may <br>
change their strategy once again.<br>
