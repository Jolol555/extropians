<i>&gt;the full text of which appears in the following pages. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Following this historic act the Assembly called upon all Member countries </i><br>
<i>&gt;to publicize the text of the Declaration </i><br>
<i>&gt;and "to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded </i><br>
<i>&gt;principally in schools and other educational institutions, </i><br>
<i>&gt;without distinction </i><br>
<i>&gt;based on the political status of countries or territories."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PREAMBLE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights </i><br>
<i>&gt;have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of</i><br>
mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings <br>
<i>&gt;shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want </i><br>
<i>&gt;has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the commonpeople,</i><br>

<i>&gt;that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations </i><br>

<i>&gt;in the dignity and worth of the human person </i><br>
<i>&gt;and in the equal rights of men and women</i><br>
<i>&gt;and have determined to promotesocial progress and better standards of life </i><br>
<i>&gt;in larger freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, </i><br>
<i>&gt;in co-operation withthe United Nations, the promotion of universal respect </i><br>
<i>&gt;for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,</i><br>
