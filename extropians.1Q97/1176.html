----- Forwarded message from Damien Broderick -----<br>
<p>
(Australian TV, btw, broadcast a nice program last night where Agent Scully<br>
told us about robots, along with clips from sf movies, interviews with<br>
Asimov as a young chap - who to my horror and amazement pronounced `robot'<br>
as `ROW-but' rather than `ROW-BOT' - and Rodney Brooks.  No Hugo de Garis,<br>
however...)<br>

Something I found amusing: soon after Gillian Anderson tells us that<br>
one day robots will be superior to humans, we have her voiceover saying<br>
"Next week, we learn how humans will travel to the stars." I thought<br>
it was a great example of compartmentalization of ideas. The robots, <br>
which, we were told only a few minutes earlier, will probably dominate <br>
our "fantastic future", have now disappeared from the picture, and we're <br>
back to a future of humans.<br>
<p>
I only saw the last few minutes of the show, but it looked to me as<br>
though they'd neglected the ideas of cyborgization, uploading, and<br>
the postbiological "upgrading" of humans - ideas which do something to<br>
subvert the perspective that it'll be "Them or Us".<br>
