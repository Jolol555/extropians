There is experimental music in EVERY musical scene. If you don't look for<br>
it, you're not going to find it.<br>

Ofcourse a DJ's view is focussed on making people dance. But what about the<br>
phenomena of 'ambient DJ's' ? Don't forget that the popularity of the techno<br>
'dance' scene has created a market for more alternative and experimental<br>
varieties of the music as well. Before the mid eighties the world's leading<br>
music style was american guitar rock, i think anything 'techno' today is an<br>
improvement over that. The scene has just exploded, and it's harder to find<br>
what you like, but it's there, and more of it. <br>
<p>

too &gt;easy for thousand of people with no imagination or nothing to say to<br>
make &gt;something that "sounds right" or seems like art.<br>
<p>
Well then ? What is art ? Would you call Mozart art ? The simplicity of<br>
Mozart's music is obvious, yet we refer to it as art. Who is to say what is<br>
art, and what is not ? <br>

It is. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Mind you, I gather from some American friends of mine that the club scene</i><br>
in &gt;the States is only just now starting to catch on in the way it has been<br>
going &gt;here in the UK  and the rest of Europe since the late 80s<br>
<p>
Some of the first house records in '86, sold over a million copies in<br>
chicago alone. But you are right, In the US, the scene has only recently<br>
(the last two or three years) expanded beyond the north eastern large<br>
cities. It's the largest potential market for the future (and what about<br>
eastern europe ?), one where the the market still grows faster than the new<br>
labels/musicians.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As Vonnegut said, 90% of everything is crap, and there is indeed a lot of</i><br>
crap &gt;techno around,  but it certainly isn't the artistic desert you seem to<br>
think it &gt;is.<br>
<p>
Let's say 99% of techno is crap. 2000 new releases a month, that means 20<br>
quality releases a month (by whatever standards you prefer to use). The<br>
problem is even when you're a specialized DJ, you're only going to find<br>
about 5 of those 20... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Modern techno is music designed for people on drugs in a specific</i><br>
environment, &gt;and you won't understand it, or be able to appreciate it at<br>
home on your hifi &gt;or on the radio unless you have gotten into it in those<br>
circumstances. That's &gt;the reality, take it or leave it.)<br>
<p>
This is a very narrow minded view as well, techno expanded beyond that long ago.<br>
It has grown up to be a full musical style, with countless subgenres which<br>
are not all 'tailor made' to suit drug crazed kids on raves of 50.000<br>
people. It's true you have to have been there to understand the roots of the<br>
music and the effects of it, and in most genres of house and techno, the<br>
element remains, but techno is much more than just a 'soundtrack' to xtc or<br>
parties.<br>
