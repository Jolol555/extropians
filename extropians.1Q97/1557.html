Hal Finney said, about memory, "Memory is not exactly a process.  It is more <br>
like a database which the processes within our minds can access."<br>
<p>
Actually, memory *is* a process, and it is not at all like a database.  I <br>
don't know all the details of how the brain works, and what I do know is too <br>
complicated for me to explain right now, but memory is not like a database at <br>
all.  First of all, only *certain* things are remembered, and then even that <br>
which is remembered changes over time.  Memories are more like millions of <br>
criscrossing footprints in a sandy beach.  Paths which are taken more often <br>
stand out more, and the paths can be follwed again much easier.  But if they <br>
are unused, they will become more and more disturbed by crossing paths and <br>
random, wandering footprints.<br>
<p>
Our memories are in the reinforcement of certain pathways and the signals <br>
flowing through those pathways.  Nearly all experiences are not remembered at <br>
all.   Look at all the millions of details of the scene around you; you can <br>
take all this in with a single glance and be consciously aware of all the <br>
millions of minute details around you, all the subtle shadings textures and <br>
colors.  If you close your eyes, you will quickly forget almost everything.  <br>
You may remember certain *general* things, but nearly *all* of the detail is <br>
lost; you can no longer see the scene with the same vivid clarity that you did <br>
with your eyes open.  <br>
<p>
Our memories are not *records* of the past, they are the ways we have adapted <br>
to our past experiences.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Hal, commenting on my last post in this thread, said, "There may be patterns <br>
at many levels, but I can still draw a line which separates the patterns that <br>
make up my identity from those which represent culture and metabolism."<br>
<p>
I think you underestimate the extent that your culture and metabolism <br>
influence your personality, your ways of thinking and your current momentary <br>
experience.  You certainly have your own uniqueness, but *most* of what you <br>
are is shared by everyone else.  We all have the same basic metabolism, we all <br>
operate according to the same laws of physics and our basic thought patterns <br>
are all quite similar.  We tend to focus so much on what makes us different <br>
from each other that we don't notice how nearly identical we all are.<br>
<p>
When you talk about the patterns that make up your identity, I assume you are <br>
referring to the patterns which make you unique among humans.  These patterns <br>
are certainly important parts of you, but if I was studying you as a physical <br>
process, I would look at all the other processes supporting your personality <br>
too, such as your metabolism and your culture and the laws of physics.  <br>
Consider how deeply these things influence the way you look at the world.  The <br>
shape and movements of your body and all its requirements have had a profound <br>
effect on your ways of thinking and on your self image.  The laws of physics <br>
and the sensory world around you have also had profound effects upon the way <br>
you think and the way you act.  The culture you developed within shaped your <br>
mind in deep ways.  All these things are part of *you*.  There is no dividing <br>
line between ourselves and our metabolism and our culture and the laws of <br>
physics and so forth.  If those things were different, we would be different <br>
too.<br>
<p>
We are much more and much deeper than we typically think we are.<br>
