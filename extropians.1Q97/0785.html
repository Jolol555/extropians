<i>&gt; } &gt; orbit first.  Actually I was wrong; using a better mean distance (384400</i><br>

<i>&gt; } You were projecting the use of a propulsin system so efficient that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; } could accelerate constantly at above one G from the earth to the moon?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, I was postulating a Saturn V.  The time given above is for an object</i><br>
<i>&gt; moving at 11 km/s, which is the velocity needed to get off of Earth in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first place.  Where did your acceleration figure come from?</i><br>
<p>
I know that at 8km/s it takes 8.6 hours to get from earth surface to<br>
GEO, which is only 41,000 km up. At 11km/s it should take around 6<br>
hours. Given the goal is reaching the L1 point (at around 185,000 miles)<br>
with excess velocity, I'm guestimating off the cuff around 50-60 hours<br>
at a bare minimum to reach the moon with conventional propulsion.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } And an easily detectable military mobilization in orbit will be seen to</i><br>
<i>&gt; } be as much of a threat by any non allied nations on earth, raising</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps.  It wouldn't kill an Earth power to just launch missiles from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ground, a la Apollo; I was just noting that vastly greater speeds</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't very hard to obtain.  As the US already has the power to wipe out</i><br>
<i>&gt; most life on the planet, objecting to putting some missiles in orbit</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be somewhat silly, although somewhat natural.  But the US might</i><br>
<i>&gt; not care.  Or the US might sell it as a defense against lunar rebels.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or claim it's just part of a meteoroid defense system... hell, it might</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually _be_ a meteoroid defense system.  Big nuke on fast rocket</i><br>
<i>&gt; capable of hitting a slow target.  Should be somewhat flexible.</i><br>
<p>
Hey, I'm not saying its not possible. I just think that people are<br>
giving earth governments too much credit. They are way too incompetent<br>
for this to be probable.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } costs of putting earth resources in orbit (since they won't be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; } get them from the moon) add additional expense to such an endeavor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A meteoroid defense would justify fairly heavy costs.</i><br>

To who? TO you maybe because you have a modicum of vision. The average<br>
joe voter cant think beyond the next sixpack.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } mount a successful 8 day campaign here ON EARTH to recover 100 square</i><br>
<i>&gt; } miles of desert wasteland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; } There is a HUGE differential in the costs that a defender must incur vs</i><br>
<i>&gt; } the attacker to win a confrontation. Here on earth the differential can</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Assuming your numbers were correct, so what?  Conquest and destruction</i><br>
<i>&gt; are completely different things.  That's why your supposed differentials</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't apply to Luna -- regardless of who attacks first, each side is</i><br>
<i>&gt; fighting by attacking the other with big weapons.  Different big</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons, but big weapons.</i><br>
<p>
Destruction of facilities would be acceptable. Desctruction of civilians<br>
would raise such a ruckus in the UN that it would likely break up. Japan<br>
alone would walk out of the UN if the subject of nuclear bombardment<br>
came up.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } Whatever the scenario, one of the important points is that any corporate</i><br>
<i>&gt; } group that seriously develops the moon, once it is assured of resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; } that they would be incredibly irresponsible to their stockholders to NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, would these stockholders still be on Earth?  If so, I hope I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to expand on the flaws in this scenario.  Even if not, the colony</i><br>
<i>&gt; might not be independent of further immigration, which Earth could cut</i><br>
<i>&gt; off.</i><br>
<p>
What do you mean, as far as I see, its lunocos fifth column. The<br>
stockholders would be the most likely to push earth gov to acceed to<br>
lunar independence, as they would probably control a large percentage of<br>
the lobby and reelection money that politicians slather over.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } benfits from, their ability to multiply greater rates of capital growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Without an influx of skilled people, perhaps not.</i><br>
<p>
True, but when in history has that ever really worked? All it would take<br>
is one rogue nation willing to act as a landing field for lunoco<br>
transports. Promise them the earthside He3 concession, and you'll have<br>
two bit countries falling all over themselves to toe the lunar party<br>
line.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, I'm not saying there aren't scenarios where a young colony can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; break away.  In some scenarios they might be let go without pain.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; just don't see that the gravity well is a super-ace that lets Luna off</i><br>
<i>&gt; under any conditions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another variation: Luna declares independence.  Earth protests formally</i><br>
<i>&gt; and harasses any ground connection but otherwise does not attack.  Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; then heavily invests in getting a government presence in space, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; can compete directly with Mikeycorp or turn against you later, "bringing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the deviants back into the fold."  An attempt to maintain your monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; in space before the gov't grows strong there then justifies a</i><br>
<i>&gt; destructive attack against you.</i><br>
<p>
Possible. I just think that given gov'ts past record of incompetence,<br>
and the added weight of supporting whining retirees and welfarees that<br>
contribute nothing productive, will doom any earthgov enterprise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } What is the situation with superconductors and EMPs? I thought that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; } did not conduct magnetic fields at all, just current? Also, you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In my understanding, past a certain level of current the self-inducted</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnetic fields interfere with whatever is happening inside the</i><br>
<i>&gt; superconductor, which then stops being a superconductor.  In the case of</i><br>
<i>&gt; metals, you still have a conductor.  In the case of ceramics, you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wonderful space heater.  Given the complexity of the superconducting</i><br>
<i>&gt; phenomenon, I would be rather surprised if you could have arbitrary</i><br>
<i>&gt; amounts of current be carried with no resistance without limit.  So</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether an EMP directly induces current past the maximum load, or heats</i><br>
<i>&gt; the superconductor past its critical temperature causing a failure that</i><br>
<i>&gt; way, there could be a problem.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah but the levels of flux that are run through such coils for use in<br>
induction guns is extremely high, I would guess, until I dig up my<br>
formulary for pulse power devices, that it is as high as that which<br>
would be induced by an EMP from a near miss. Its the microelectronics<br>
that can't stand EMPs. Thats why survivalists all drive cars with<br>
point/coil ignition systems, so when doomdsay comes they will have cars<br>
that still run.<br>
