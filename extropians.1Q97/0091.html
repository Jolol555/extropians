Not now, no; I was arguing that science might have been caused by<br>
Catholic thinking.  The Church is not a monolith; Aquinas, Bacon and the<br>
Inquisition can be aspects of the same thing.<br>

Fair point, I think.  Yet unless you give X-nity most of the credit for<br>
the Roman fall, Greek influence in Europe was probably in sharp decline<br>
anyway, waiting in Alexandria and the later Islamic empire for a<br>
resurgence.  As you say, it's unclear what a pagan and Churchless Europe<br>
would have accomplished.  I note that the Church did at least maintain a<br>
literate class and a common educated language, although that's tangential<br>
at best to my original argument about motivations to science.<br>
<p>
Hmm.  It's be amusing to convince myself that the Church had no net<br>
effect.<br>
