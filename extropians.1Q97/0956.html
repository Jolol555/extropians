<i>&gt; Here is that conundrum again, what do you mean by words have meaning? That</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have an effect on people? What can they do, if they don't cause thoughts</i><br>
<i>&gt; which give rise to emotions which then give rise to actions.</i><br>
<p>
What I mean is just this: that when I say "axe", I have in mind a specific<br>
kind of thing that exists in the real world, has a specific nature that<br>
causes it to behave in certain ways, and that differentiate it from other<br>
specific things like knives and hammers.<br>
<p>
You may have different models in your mind attached to certain words<br>
than I do, and that makes communication difficult, and on those cases<br>
we have to spend time reconciling what real things I am referring to,<br>
and either start referring to them with the word you use for that real<br>
thing, or perhaps create a new word that we agree on.<br>
<p>
The alternative to "words mean something" is "words are subjective",<br>
that is, my words cause some reaction in your mind, and your words<br>
cause some reaction in mine, and there is nothing external to us that<br>
we can point to or measure to resolve the difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;What do you mean by "allow for" emotions?  Do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mean to recognize that they exist? &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, they do not need your recogition in order to exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, simply,  I mean FEEL them, allow the emotion that is appropriate, then do</i><br>
<i>&gt; the_work_( and it can take work) to control them, instead of repressing them</i><br>
<i>&gt; or denying they exist. This is different than compulsively acting (reacting)</i><br>
<i>&gt; on them or expressing them,. BTW.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think I've ever said anything contrary to that.  Indeed, I quite<br>
clearly stated that I experience and enjoy emotion regularly.  To deny<br>
their existence in myself or others, or to act to supress them, would<br>
indeed be irrational.<br>
<p>
What I am saying is entirely different.  I am saying one should not<br>
/evaluate/ ideas by the emotional response to them, but by reason.  To<br>
use words only to manipulate the emotions of the listener--positively<br>
as well as negatively--is to treat him as a puppet instead of a human.<br>
He has a rational mind.  He has free will.  I know this because I know<br>
that I have free will.  I refuse to insult him by tailoring my ideas<br>
to his irrational reactions.  Indeed, if I know he has these irrational<br>
reactions, I want to help him overcome them, not deny or evade them.<br>
