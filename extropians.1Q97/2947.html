<i>&gt;Sorry, George, I just don't buy your rant, if that's what it is.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;present flavour (British spelling, interesting)  is toward the LEFT???  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;century are you coming from?  The last election saw two Replublicans running</i><br>
<i>&gt;against each other, with Clinton making speeches that could have come from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ronald Reagan.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Do you or do you not have a Democrat as president?  Is it or is it not<br>
extremely likely that the Labour party will be elected to office in the<br>
UK at the next general election?  Of course these left wing parties have<br>
been influenced by libertarian economic ideas: as has the right, for the<br>
past 15 years or so!  (However, this is not an ideological commitment<br>
<i>&gt;from either side, as Soros would have it, but a practical economic</i><br>
necessity, grudgingly and shamefacedly admitted to, except by some<br>
enthusiastic Republicans and Tories.) However, the Democrats do not<br>
subscribe to the nationalistic/moralistic (fascist) fervour of the<br>
Republicans, nor does Labour do the equivalent in the UK.<br>
<p>
These are still left-wing parties. I would also really urge you to try<br>
that book shop experiment. Really, there are very few books in bookshops<br>
and libraries that support laissez faire; laissez faire is considered a<br>
crankish ideology by most intellectuals, and has been since the 19th<br>
century.  So I ask you again: why would somebody lie about that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And, in fact, Soros has redistributed a lot of his own money, mostly in sort</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a one man Marshall plan for Eastern Europe.  For a capitalist, he's not</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a bad guy.</i><br>
<p>
OK, but judging by his statements, I would look very carefully at his<br>
'redistribution'.  I would be willing to bet that most of it is likely to<br>
have been to his own advantage; probably a lot of it has gone to support <br>
*government* schemes in Eastern Europe.  If I am wrong, then I retract<br>
what I say about his being consciously evil: he would be just a<br>
well-meaning but misguided fool.<br>
