Again, though there are exceptions, I think it is more often that we<br>
find transpersonalism rather than transhumanism to be a religious goal.<br>
Where transhumanism tends to be directed towards the individuation and<br>
autonomy of self, transpersonalism is directed towards the mystical<br>
diffusion [or at the least, subservience] of self. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; indeed, it rather predates (and possibly indirectly inspired) notions</i><br>

<p>
I still think the same is true of science in general. Both religion and<br>
science have a desire for the attainment of truth, what differs between<br>
them is the definition of truth, and the motivation and methods for<br>
attaining truth. One evolved from the other and we can say this without<br>
being ashamed. We don't call ourselves perversions of apes just because<br>
we evolved from primates. In the same sense I don't think it is useful<br>
to say that science or extropianism is a perversion of religion, even<br>
though both have evolved out of religion. It is also silly to deny the<br>
roots that science has in religion. Religion was the point of departure<br>
for science, but again, this is not something to be ashamed of. There is<br>
no reason to be ashamed of the fact that I used to be a baby that shit<br>
in its diapers. I have progressed beyond that without feeling a need to<br>
deny the fact.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;   What is uncommon here most notably includes the attempt to achieve</i><br>

<p>
Here and in the first sentence of your post you seem to refer to the<br>
technological aspect of transhumanism as that which separates it from<br>
someone else refered to as the "Nuts of the Millenium". I don't think<br>
that is sufficient. It would make transhumanists just as ludicrously<br>
extreme as any other "Nuts" group. If we imagine ourselves as cyborgs,<br>
part biological, part technological, and our focus is merely on the<br>
technological, then we are denying a large percent of who and what we<br>
are, and I would say we are denying the most important part, the part<br>
that feels. We each own a model of the currently most powerful<br>
"computer" in the world, our brains, and there is nothing wrong in<br>
employing it.                                                         <br>
<p>
Uploading is a common topic on this listserv. Until there becomes an<br>
interest in giving computers feelings and emotions [felt sensations],<br>
then uploading will remain somewhat of a ludic concept to me. Once I am<br>
uploaded in a computer, if I cannot experience emotions/feelings then<br>
there really isn't any reason for me to continue existing. Without<br>
pleasure and pain I cannot imagine a motivation to perpetuate myself. It<br>
would be the exemplar epitomy of stoicism. No excitement, no<br>
frustration, no ecstasy, no sense of struggle and adventure, no fear, no<br>
joy, no feeling whatsoever .... merely a program, 010010101001011110101,<br>
ad infinitum; technological bliss-nirvana. There has to be a balance.<br>
Otherwise its just another escapism.  <br>
