        Sorry to bring back an old ghost, but I fear it has not yet been<br>
quelled on this list.  This post is about the mentality of gender<br>
differentiation (or the lack thereof) and the multitudes of gender related<br>
taboos.  I believe that it is an extropian topic in that it deals with<br>
various aspects of human thought...something that is detrimental to a<br>
posthuman existance.<br>
<p>
        One can take all the feminist and misogynist movements (give or take<br>
a few short lived movements in particular) and roll them into two seperate<br>
piles: domination or equality.  A common feminist argument I hear is one of<br>
female persecution through the centuries.  It is true.  Until Mary Shelley<br>
and Emily Dickinson came around in the nineteenth century, there had been<br>
virtually no female notability (I'm excluding "nobility") since Joan of Arc,<br>
and prior to her, Sappho.  It is quite unfortunate that women were shunned<br>
for so many centuries --I'm sure that there were just as many potentially<br>
powerful women as there were kinetically powerful men;<br>
but for *some* reason, women were not encouraged to be great...they were not<br>
taught that they were equal to men in mental ability.  Instead, women were<br>
taught to be 'perfect little housewives' and convinced that they were doing<br>
*men* a service by bearing children.  Perhaps this was partially due<br>
to the devotionary diatribe of the Bible --which stated that men are<br>
dominant-- though the true answer will probably never be found.<br>
<p>
        This is a compelling argument for feminists, and a very true one<br>
*but* I seriously wonder how this affects the present.  Sure, the past has<br>
been male-dominated, but what is the current aim of feminism?  Do feminist<br>
movements want females to dominate males to make up for the past antithesis<br>
between the genders?  Or do feminist movements want to bring the whole<br>
concept of "gender" up to a plateau?  Is there a desire for domination or<br>
equality?  I, of course, prefer the latter.  I find domination to be<br>
entropic, to say the least.  Mankind can learn from the<br>
past and use it to extrope toward the future.<br>
<p>
        Currently, there seems to be a gender imbalance; this "imbalance" is<br>
more mental than physical.  The idea of 'women's rights' is the same as<br>
saying 'people with red moustaches' rights': it boils down to an ideal of<br>
the elevation of one portion of mankind over another.  Why should there be<br>
women's rights?  What gives women an advantage over men?  Why should there<br>
be male rights?  What gives men an advantage over women?  Why should there<br>
be gay rights?  What gives gays an advantage over non-gays?  To me, it<br>
simply does not make sense.  To me, the concept of "rights" is an irrational<br>
belief that one person has power over another, and that inevitably *causes*<br>
sexism, racism and people-with-red-moustachism rather<br>
than illeviating it.  It invokes the other "non-rights" group(s) to gain an<br>
advantage over the "rights" group(s).  *That* is what creates an imbalance.<br>
<p>
        I cannot understand a need for a moral imbalance of any sort.  I<br>
open my eyes and see *people* thinking and *people* acting, not particularly<br>
*women* or *men* doing such.  Just as I conveyed in the "Genius" thread<br>
about a month ago, there are *no* boundaries except those which we<br>
create...either as mankind or as individuals.  If someone wishes to become<br>
something, that one generally can do so if he or she has strong enough of a<br>
will to kineticize his potential.  There is no rift between the sexes, just<br>
as there is no rift between the races.  We create rifts<br>
by saying that there *are* rifts because there aren't.  Women think the same<br>
way that men do (generally); one race thinks the same way as another race<br>
(generally).  I don't see the rift.  Why create one?<br>
