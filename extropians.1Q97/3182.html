Someone kindly wrote:<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
You need to take out the carriage returns and excess spaces from the URL <br>
pasted into the message.  Netscape 1.X would automatically clean this up <br>
on the Macintosh along with QuickMail Express and QuickMail Pro from CE <br>
software also have automatic fixes in Macintosh and Windows for TCP/IP <br>
POP e-mail systems.  Netscape 3.X and who knows if Netscape 4.X will <br>
handle long URL(s) with embedded spaces and carriage returns like the <br>
old versions did so elegantly.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

Thanks, but it was amisunderstanding.<br>
( Unfortunately - it seems that alta vista is what he intended to supply... )<br>
i assumed it was SUPOSED to be an URL and somehow the wrong thing was cut and<br>
pasted up..<br>
SORRY - for adding to the clutter in the list, alta vista is already on my<br>
Bookmark on netscape. I had attempted to cut and paste this and use it on<br>
this aol browser... I use aol for email only, not internet or WWW.<br>
