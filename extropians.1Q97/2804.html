I very definitely do NOT believe that is true.<br>

It's true, the market can not find a solution to a problem if nobody wants<br>
a solution to that problem, but problems that don't need fixing are not<br>
problems.<br>

I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% .  I want to drive you<br>
out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then<br>
I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you louse money on each widget<br>
you sell, the trouble is I do too. I have 99 times as much money as you do,<br>
but I'm lousing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very low<br>
the demand for widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must build<br>
more factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and faster,<br>
meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory and wait<br>
for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.                                 <br>

<i>        &gt;[profit is not good when] 1) when that profit is not re-inserted </i><br>
<i>        &gt;into society by spending/consuming. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
How could that be? If I don't spend it but put the profit in the bank then<br>
the money will be loaned out for other profitable ventures.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;2) profit can be made by ways that undermine the free market system.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;monopoly positions, patents, etc...</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The only monopoly that is dangerous is government, the very biggest one, <br>
because the only successful cartels in history are the ones that have<br>
government support.<br>
          <br>
Your company and mine produce all the steel made in the world. We make a good<br>
profit now, but we want more, so we get together and triple our prices.<br>
Now we each make a huge profit on each ton of steel we sell, so we would both<br>
want to make lots and lots of steel. However, because the price of steel is<br>
now very high demand is down, so part of our sinister plot must be an<br>
agreement to limit production. The higher the price gets, the greater is the<br>
temptation to secretly cheat on the agreement and produce more steel than was<br>
agreed to and that would kill the cartel.<br>
<p>
There are even more problems for our poor cartel. Now that the price of steel<br>
is sky high and the profits are huge, other companies will want to get in on<br>
the act and start making steel. Also, consumers of steel will not want to<br>
shell out all that money for steel and will start looking for replacement<br>
materials like wood or plastic or aluminum or composite fiber. <br>
<p>
OK I will admit that one type of monopoly, called a "natural monopoly" would  <br>
work in a free market, but they don't bother me. In a few, very rare <br>
instances, the most efficient size of a factory is so big that there is only  <br>
room for one, the best example is aluminum production. A larger steel mill is  <br>
not more efficient than a smaller one, it's just bigger, but for physical  <br>
reasons that's not true for an aluminum plant, the bigger the better.<br>
<p>
However even a natural monopoly is limited to what it can do. If they raise  <br>
prices too high a competitor with a smaller factory will step in. The small  <br>
factory is not as efficient as the big one, but by accepting a smaller profit  <br>
margin they can still charge less for aluminum than the big company. And of <br>
course, there is always the competition from other materials. <br>
<p>
This logic did not phase the US government when in it's infinite wisdom it  <br>
decided to break up Alcoa Aluminum. What dreadful crime had Alcoa committed?  <br>
The government said it had kept competitors out. What dastardly method did  <br>
Alcoa use to do this? The government said Alcoa used the most advanced <br>
technology available to produce Aluminum that was just too cheap for  <br>
competitors to match. How very dreadful! I wish I was joking about this, but  <br>
I am not. If you can't beat them in the market place, lobby the government to  <br>
send in their goons to destroy your competition.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I see a need for a big institution (not necessarily a state) to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;supply education, maybe even invest in individuals, for profit </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reasons. </i><br>
                                         <br>
Yes, I like big institutions too, civilization could not exist without them,<br>
I just don't like government.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;humans don't see things long term (due to their limited life span)   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is some truth in that, but all proposed societies are composed of<br>
humans, so that's a problem we'll just have to live with.<br>
                                                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think it was Eric who pointed out a protection system against</i><br>
<i>        &gt;asteroids, how do you see a free market system taking care of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;problems of this scope ? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't think that's a very good example, government has not come up with a<br>
solution to that problem either. If individuals will not voluntarily <br>
contribute to a project to save their lives, then why would they vote for <br>
a politician who would force them to?<br>
<p>
                                                     <br>
<i>        &gt;Think about it, what place do mentally disordered people have in an </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anarcho capitalist society ? They can't provide for themselves, and </i><br>
<i>        &gt;i don't believe in peoples altruism (at least not anymore). </i><br>
                                                     <br>
<p>
People can be altruistic, each year they voluntarily contribute hundreds of<br>
billions of dollars to charity, if government was not stealing half their<br>
income they would contribute even more.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;An uncoordinated society is throwing away resources by the truckloads. </i><br>
       <br>
<p>
Who said anything about an uncoordinated society?<br>
                                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Would you do everything given the price is high enough ?</i><br>
        <br>
No.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;Most people value something higher than profit, im truly sorry for </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you if you don't.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Making money is one form of profit but most certainly not the only form, or <br>
the most important. If I learn something new about the world then I have<br>
profited, if I do something that makes me happy then I have profited from it.<br>
The Free Market maximizes all forms of profit.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;a free market system relies heavily on chance: the chance that</i><br>
<i>        &gt;problems in society will be tackled by making them profitable. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
People do not like problems, they will pay money to have them solved.<br>
Of course the market can not solve a problem if it is not recognized as such,<br>
but no other system can do that either.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;a chance which in my opinion offers no guarantees</i><br>
<p>
You only find guarantees in Mathematics, in the world of human affairs all<br>
you can do is make your best bet, and the best bet is the market.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the profit principle will result in individuals and companies not</i><br>
<i>        &gt;directing their efforts to simply activities that are profitable,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;but instead will focus mainly on those that are THE MOST PROFITABLE.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In other words the most effort will be diverted to solving those problems<br>
that most people judge to be most serious. As it is not reasonable to expect<br>
to solve all of the worlds problems at the same time, that seem like an<br>
efficient use of limited resources to me.<br>
