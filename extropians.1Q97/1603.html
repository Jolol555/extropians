It's a clich‚ but like most clich‚s it's true, truth is stranger than fiction. <br>
I quote from that scholarly tomb "The hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy" <br>
by Douglas Adams:<br>
<p>
 "The principle of generating small amounts of FINITE improbably by simply  <br>
  hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub Meson Brain to an atomic  <br>
  vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian motion producer (say a nice   <br>
  hot cup of tea) were of course well understood- and such generators were  <br>
  often used to break the ice at parties by making the molecules of the <br>
  hostess's undergarments lead simultaneously one foot to the left, in   <br>
  accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy."<br>
<p>
 "Many respected physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this,  <br>
  partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they   <br>
  didn't get invited to those sort of parties."<br>
<p>
 "Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they <br>
  encountered  in trying to construct a machine which could generate the <br>
  INFINITE improbability field needed to flip a space ship across the <br>
  mind-paralyzing distances between the farthest stars, and in the end they <br>
  grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible."<br>
<p>
 "Then one day, a student who had been left to sweep up after a particularly  <br>
  unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: If, he thought to   <br>
  himself, such a machine was a VIRTUAL impossibility it must be a FINITE  <br>
  improbability. So all I have to do to make one is to work out exactly how  <br>
  improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator,  <br>
  give it a fresh cup of really hot tea... and turn it on!"<br>
<p>
 "He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to  <br>
  create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability Generator out   <br>
  of thin air."<br>
<p>
 "It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic   <br>
  Institute's prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob  <br>
  of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they <br>
  really couldn't stand was a smart ass."   <br>
<p>
Of course Adams's work is fiction and he got it all wrong, you use coffee <br>
not tea.<br>
