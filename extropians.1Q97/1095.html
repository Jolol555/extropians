Argh.  Here I go jumping in and defining terms again...<br>
<p>
The argument is male/female genius, with a group of people arguing that<br>
there are "fewer" female geniuses.<br>
<p>
If we make the assumption that a genius is simply a person who is<br>
extremely intelligent, then we've got to define intelligence in order to<br>
have a debate.  ( <a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Intelligence/">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Intelligence/</a> )<br>
<p>
Once we've made that leap, we've still got to clarify the resolution. <br>
Are we are we arguing whether there is something genetically different<br>
between men/women which would make men fundamentally smarter than women?<br>
Then it's time to start using some published scientific data to prove<br>
your point.  Both sides.<br>
<p>
Are we simply suggesting that there are more men geniuses out there in<br>
the world right now, perhaps due to social stereotyping of the past<br>
which have encouraged male genius?  Then perhaps we'd best define<br>
intelligence very clearly and find some statistical data.  If we can't<br>
do that, then there's no facts behind this argument.<br>
<p>
As for my POV, my experience has shown me a great number of women who<br>
are very intelligent, IMHO.  Based on my experience, I think that the Y<br>
chromosome has little to do with intelligence, but more to do with<br>
social stereotyping which might discourage women from displaying or<br>
making public use of their intelligence.  This has no validity in a<br>
debate whatsoever, but it is my opinion.  Carry on.  :)<br>
