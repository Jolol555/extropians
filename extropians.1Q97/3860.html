This is very much the case, seeing cases in courts on surrogate mother<br>
contracts, ski accidents, etc, the validity of contracts is very much<br>
threatened, and i share your disgust with the state of things. I lost my<br>
lighting business for the most part due to such a case, and have seen<br>
two ski areas owned by freinds gone bankrupt due to such disregard.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That an intagible property like a book, program, DNA sequence, or</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; two copies of a property can obviously serve the ends of two people at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; once.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes!  That's exactly my point, but it doesn't invalidate /my/ argument,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it topples yours.  A book, a program, and a DNA sequence ARE NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; PROPERTY, because property is, by definition, that which two people</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot simultaneously own.  Your continued insistence to call them</i><br>
<i>&gt; property is just a failure to see that that's precisely what we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguing about.</i><br>
<p>
This is where we get down to nuts and bolts. I say that my selling you a<br>
book or software program is  only a license to USE said material for a<br>
limited purpose, not a right to reproduce the particular copy you have. <br>
Whether this is done by a highly costly system of complex contractual<br>
arrangements for each and every customer, which I must enforce in civil<br>
court on a case by case basis, or by a system where all members of a<br>
society agree that works that are copyrighted are used by a standardized<br>
and legally defined behavior, that is enforced by a mutual aid pact<br>
(duh, the feds or private cops, it matters not), is simply a matter of<br>
what is most cost effective. I say a copyright system is more cost<br>
effective, you say personal agreements are. Sorry i don't have the funds<br>
to pay lawyers to argue with you on the issue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That we humans are intelligent, and can create new knowledge sets us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; apart and justifies our concept that we are more than just animals,...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If we are to maintain</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that all power is derived from the individual (as Jefferson, et al,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stipulated), and not as a consequence of one person having a bigger gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (as Mao stipulated), we must ask, what is it about a person that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; different from an average animal?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, I am unimpressed by any claims that human cognition is of</i><br>
<i>&gt; any significantly different character than animal cognition, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; than simply a matter of degree.  Such arguments are usually made by</i><br>
<i>&gt; mystics who want to think we have some special place in the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than just being yet another clump of cells in the soup of life.</i><br>
<p>
hardly. any cognition that is unable to improve the condition of the<br>
following generation over itself is an unimaginative animal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I claim no supernatural or other external source of these rights, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fact that these concepts are, in the big scheme of things, merely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; created fictions, the fact that we concieved them, and can observe them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in practice is demonstration enough of our uniqueness, and of the source</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the power of the individual. What is it that makes each of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individuals? partly, it is our DNA, and partly, it is the ideas,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thoughts, dreams, and experiences we as individuals go through on our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; own unique paths through life. because of this, these two things that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; make us individuals deserve and demand our full protection.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even Jefferson, who you seem to esteem, utterly rejected the idea that</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge itself could be "property", and this is in fact still the</i><br>
<i>&gt; law, affirmed in Feist v. Rural, though even this is in danger from</i><br>
<i>&gt; recently proposed treaties.  Even the DNA you claim as the most natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; of properties has already been litigated, and found NOT to be property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that creation is a wonderful thing, but the value of creation</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself is more than sufficient to ensure its rewards.  When you combine</i><br>
<i>&gt; it with force, you devalue it.</i><br>
<p>
of course it is not property, since if it were, the big corporations<br>
would have to pay royalties to any tom dick or harriet they stole genes<br>
from to make their hideously expensive drugs with.<br>
<p>
As for combining creation with force being a devaluing property, i would<br>
say that failing to protect the creative rights of the individual, with<br>
laws, litigation, or even force, we denigrate the individual and the<br>
idea that power derives from the individual.<br>
