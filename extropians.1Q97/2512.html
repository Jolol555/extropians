Hmmm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it would be next to<br>
impossible to remove the topic of religion from any in depth discourse<br>
involving science. Would you grant me that subjects of faith are the<br>
property of religion? ... And that every science is based on precepts<br>
which cannot be proven and thus must be accepted via faith alone? If so,<br>
is religion not the foundation of science? It seems to me that religion<br>
might be the buffer between science and the unknown. As science expands,<br>
so does its religion. Perhaps if we replaced the word faith with<br>
probability, it would all become science again, i.e., instead of saying,<br>
"I have faith in this a priori precept", I might say, "It is probable<br>
that this a priori precept is true." But then, by replacing the concept<br>
of faith with that of probability, am I not merely ontotheologically<br>
sublimating the concept of faith with a more evolved or refined concept<br>
of the same? Is probability anything more than exalted faith? Just a<br>
thought.<br>
<p>
I don't see science so much as a departure from religion, but the<br>
evolution of it. We still have similar goals such as immortality and<br>
controlling the masses [doctrine and crusades vs. military weapons<br>
technology]. It doesn't appear science has become much more mature than<br>
religion ... though perhaps more refined, more sophisticated.<br>
<p>
   The evolution of attaining what we need/desire:   <br>
   primal need/desire --&gt; religion --&gt; philosophy --&gt; science    <br>
<p>
I have faith, or does it just seem probable to me, that there will be<br>
something beyond science as well. Hard to imagine, but things always<br>
move on. I bet the evolutionay path I so wonderfully typed above will<br>
recursively come full circle ascending once again to a more<br>
sophisticated level. This would mean the synergism of science [reason]<br>
and emotion. Again, hard to imagine, but it might not hurt to think<br>
about it. What ever it will be, it is inevitable (very probable) that<br>
someone will make the next leap.  <br>
<p>
E[PN/D] --&gt; R --&gt; P --&gt; S --&gt; E' --&gt; R' --&gt; P' --&gt; S' --&gt; E'' ... E^n<br>
<p>
Perhaps my emotive bent hinders my cognitive reasoning. [fancy way of<br>
saying I might be a flake.] <br>
 <br>

Thanx for the information Eric. I'll check out the URL.<br>
