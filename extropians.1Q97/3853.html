Digital they aren't, discrete is what you probably meant.  And<br>
discrete they are not either.  Spin and charge of particles are<br>
observed as discrete values, the discreteness of color charge is<br>
deduced indirectly, but mass, energy and momentum are observed<br>
as continuous.  Once you get to the level of quantization of gravity,<br>
it's not clear that discreteness will have anything to do with the<br>
quality of your theory of everything.  (There's an infinite number<br>
of correct ways to formulate QM.)<br>

Well, I don't really think we humans _need_ one, but I sure would<br>
give ten years of my life to be the first to invent a working and<br>
testable one!  :)  (Yes, I consider myself a physicist, lowercase,<br>
and I'm alive to a very good approximation.)<br>

<p>
In fact, the idea of _Euclidean_ spacetime seems to be the culprit.<br>
Spacetime as we see it is generaly believed to be an emergent<br>
phenomenon by some popular theorists.  But, as we experimentalists<br>
(what tribalism!) say, until I can make it go boom...<br>
