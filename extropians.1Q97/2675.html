<p>
I very much enjoyed Gregory Houston's &lt;vertigo@triberian.com&gt; post and even <br>
agreed with much of it, but you're causing unnecessary trouble for yourself  <br>
because I think the concept of "THE TRUTH" is functional and so should be  <br>
used.          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Our language determines our perception of reality. Words such as the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;following engender a black and white percption of the world instead         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of a greyscale perception:  Is, are, was, equal, equate, exactly,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;proven, intrinsic.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
I need these words to talk, you used a number of them yourself, even more <br>
important, I need these concepts to think, because sometimes a black and <br>
white perception is the way to go.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Conditional statements taken to the extreme continue in infinite        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;regress. The idea here is just to incrementally  strive for more,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to go a little further along the causal path.</i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
If your ideas are correct then as you progress down the causal path toward   <br>
pure mathematics things should become more black and white. I think they do, <br>
but rather than doing away with truth I would just say that in a complex <br>
world you need a lot of conditional statements.<br>
<p>
I agree with you that functionality is not the same as truth, Einstein may be <br>
truer but Newton is more useful in some cases, such as building a bridge or  <br>
sending a rocket to the moon.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;whenever I become aware of myself making an absolute statement, I am         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;going to attempt to make it more of a conditional statement, and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;more of a statement of degree [...]  Many might argue that this will        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;needlessly complexify my thought, speech and writing. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You will have to stop the conditionals at some point, otherwise all your <br>
statements would be of infinite length and you would never be able to  <br>
complete a thought.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Many people complain about making things to relative, but we haven't        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;even hardly begun to move towards relativity, not to mention to find         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a balance between it and absolutism.</i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
Even in Einstein's theory not everything is relative, the speed of light is <br>
an absolute.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The statement, "I think therefor I am", is more useful than the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;statement, "I am". </i><br>
<p>
<p>
How about  "I think therefore thoughts exist"?<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Reverting to truth in this case would be like taking Einsteins        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;theory of relativity which is created in terms of pure geometry and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;trying to revert to Newton's terms of forces. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
As speeds become slower and the gravitational field becomes weaker, <br>
Einstein's  results and Newton's become more and more similar, if they did <br>
not then nobody would bother with Einstein's theory. We already know that <br>
Newton's idea works beautifully under everyday conditions, so if Einstein <br>
didn't reduce to Newton at slow speeds then it would be wrong. In the same <br>
way your theory must reduce to true or false statement as  things get simpler.                                   <br>
<p>
We may not ever be able to find "THE TRUTH" but that doesn't mean it's not <br>
a useful abstraction, because some things are truer than others. Newton's <br>
Physics is far, far truer than the physics of Aristotle, and Einstein's <br>
Physics is Truer than Newton's. Even Einstein is not "THE TRUTH", we already <br>
know it breaks down when things get very small.<br>
<p>
Actually, what our theories do is explain how some sense sensations relate to <br>
other sense sensations. For example we receive information from our eyes, <br>
we interpret that information as a rock moving at high speed and heading for <br>
a large plate glass window, we invent a theory that predicts that very soon <br>
we will receive another sensation, this time from our ears, that we will <br>
describe as the sound of breaking glass. Soon our prediction is confirmed so <br>
the theory is successful, but we should remember that the sound of broken <br>
glass is not broken glass, the look of broken  glass is not broken glass, <br>
the feel of broken glass is not broken glass. What "IS" broken glass? <br>
It must have stable properties of some sort or I wouldn't be able to identify <br>
it as a "thing", I don't know what those ULTIMATE stable properties are, <br>
but I know what they are not, they are NOT sense sensations. I have no idea <br>
what glass "IS". The sad truth is, I can point to "things" but I don't  know <br>
what a thing "IS"  and I 'm not even sure that I know what "IS" is. <br>
<p>
What are the practical implications of all this?  Zero, near as I can tell, <br>
it's just fun to think about. Appearances are what's important, ultimate <br>
reality is for philosophers. As long as I can get the universe to SEEM to <br>
obey me and operate in a way that pleases me, that's good enough and I'll be <br>
a happy man. That's not asking too much, now is it?<br>
