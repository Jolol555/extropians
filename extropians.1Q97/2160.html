Lyle,<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Atomic events are not separate from or prior to large-scale events.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When I do something, the whole ensemble of atoms which constitute</i><br>
<i>&gt; my body (and other atoms in the air, etc) move accordingly.  Their</i><br>
<i>&gt; movements are not separate from my action;  their movements are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the embodiment of my action.  They don't lead me;  I lead them.</i><br>
<p>
Lyle, this is a great point.  It is very true that reductionism to<br>
smaller and smaller scales is a completely arbitrary perspective<br>
and that, like you said:  "Atomic events are not separate from or<br>
prior to large-scale events."  Like several other people have <br>
pointed out, we look at this from the human scale because that is<br>
what is relevant to our lives.  <br>
<p>
On the other hand, there is no absolute reason to stop at human-scale<br>
when evaluating our place in the cosmos.  Not only do the atoms in <br>
our bodies move with us when we move about, but so do the atoms in<br>
our bodies circle the sun at 18 miles/second as the Earth orbits,<br>
and this is just one step out of many going upward to larger and<br>
larger scale events.<br>
