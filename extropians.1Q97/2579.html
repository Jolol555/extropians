<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My personal quality of life increased immeasurably in the last</i><br>
<i>&gt; several</i><br>
<i>&gt; years, with the development of the Internet, and my understanding of</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have yet to see an indicator of progress that would take it into</i><br>
<i>&gt; account.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are correct, of course, about the statistics measuring "quantity</i><br>
<i>&gt; of resources spent" rather than "quality of the results".  I work at</i><br>
<i>&gt; producing the Consumer Price Index and the CPI has been much in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; news lately for allegedly overstating inflation and failing to account</i><br>
<i>&gt; for many quality improvements.</i><br>
<p>
Do you take Moore's Law into account? Considering the amount of our<br>
lives that now has to do with information and data processing, etc. some<br>
of the key products to put in your basket are basic units like mips,<br>
megs, bits, kilobaud, and dpi. Seeing as computing power has now become<br>
a commodity product (people wonder why apple is going down the drain)<br>
your idex should use simple units like this to measure the resources<br>
being spent. Such units are not just abstract things either but have a<br>
direct impact on the utility of a given product or service. A 64 bit<br>
computer game is much more entertaining than an old 16 bit game, and a<br>
56kbaud modem provides a much more enjoyable experience on the net than<br>
a clunky old 14.4, with quadruple the download rate. I can access much<br>
more information in a given time due to this.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem, of course, is that we measure what it is easiest to</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure and not necessarily what is it useful to measure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Bureau of Labor Statistics (for which I work, and for which I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; not speaking in this post) admits that the CPI can only approximate a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cost-of-Living Index.  And even if we could achieve a true COLI it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would still not represent what Nina Munk, in Sep 14, 1992 Forbes</i><br>
<i>&gt; magazine article, called a "convenience-of-living index".</i><br>
<p>
Maybe thats a good thing, next thing you know the gov't will come out<br>
with a convenience of living tax.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Right now I'm heavily involved in trying to update the samples of</i><br>
<i>&gt; goods and services that are used to produce the CPI.  We're trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; bring in such things as online services and cellular phones for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first time.  However, these things change so fast that it's extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to get a good sample.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Stick with the simple units<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; MORE INTERESTING though, is your implied desire for a *personal*</i><br>
<i>&gt; quality of living index.  Someday I'm hoping we get to the point where</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could subscribe to your own 'personal COLI' where you'd indicate</i><br>
<i>&gt; your geographic and demographic characteristics and, especially, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; categories of goods and services are most important for your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; needs, and the system would construct and weight a cost-of-living</i><br>
<i>&gt; index tailored specifically for you.  Hmmm, maybe when I get tired of</i><br>
<i>&gt; working for the government I'll see if I can construct such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; system...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Maybe your bureau could do such research on the cheap much as many<br>
software companies do: they give something away for free to people that<br>
fill out a survey. Maybe a rebate on taxes or something...<br>
