On Monday, February 24, 1997 6:18 PM, William Kitchen wrote:<br>
&lt;An op-amp circuit with strong positive feedback will tend not towards <br>
balance, but to lockup in either an extreme positive or extreme <br>
negative state.  Ungoverned free market economies also have strong <br>
positive feedback, and share this same characteristic. Imagine each <br>
individual as an op-amp.&gt;<br>
<p>
This comparison is too simplistic: bionomics is a better model than <br>
electronics for describing the economy because markets, corporations <br>
and individuals are complex adaptive systems composed of intelligent <br>
agents.<br>
<p>
Bill adds:<br>
&lt;Those who are wealthy  (positive) beyond a certain admittedly fuzzy <br>
threshold will tend to  become more wealthy (extraordinary stupidity <br>
can change that, but  I'm talking about a tendency, not an outcome <br>
that is certain in every case), while those below that threshold will <br>
tend to lose ground.  The further you are from either side of that <br>
threshold, the less likely it is that you can cross it by your <br>
intelligence and effort alone (or lack thereof, in the case of <br>
crossing the threshold in the negative direction).&gt;<br>
<p>
Economic analysis does not support this conclusion, at least not in <br>
the relatively open markets of the U.S.  Throughout most of last year, <br>
the predominantly statist press in the U.S. had been crying about <br>
rising income inequalities.  Of course, as the presidential election <br>
approached, the story shifted - things weren't really as bad as <br>
everyone thought - so that Bill Clinton could claim major progress at <br>
eliminating these 'inequities' during his first term.<br>
<p>
In the 01/25/96 Wall Street Journal, Karl Zinsmeister of the American <br>
Enterprise Institute wrote about this in an article called "Last <br>
Hurrah For Class Warriors" and noted:<br>
&lt;... the figures on cash earnings that are regularly trumpeted by <br>
economic declinists completely ignore the doubling since the early <br>
1970s of worker compensation taken in the form of fringe benefits. The <br>
increase in noncash income is even sharper on the governmental side, <br>
where every year, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of health <br>
care, food stamps and housing transfers - which didn't exist in 1970 - <br>
are pumped into the economy, unacknowledged in the national income <br>
statistics. Erroneous comparisons of demographic apples to oranges are <br>
another common mistake of those who use weak official income figures <br>
to grind their programmatic axes. When tracing median income over <br>
time, you must be sure you are looking at the same kind of <br>
household.... Families have become considerably smaller, for instance. <br>
The average family had 12% fewer members in 1993 than in 1970. And a <br>
smaller family with the same income is actually richer. When you <br>
correct the income statistics for family make-up, you find that <br>
average incomes are clearly up since the early 1970s, not down.&gt;<br>
<p>
Also from last year's Wall Street Journal, an editorial on 04/17/96 <br>
noted how liberal "anxiety scenarists present the U.S. as a static <br>
caste society" but a new Dallas Federal Reserve Bank report by Michael <br>
Cox &amp; Richard Alm "looked at income mobility for Americans over 17 <br>
years" and found:<br>
&lt;By 1991, only 5% who had been in the bottom quintile 16 years before <br>
were still there ... Of folks in the middle quintile in 1971, a full <br>
80% were at the same level or higher 16 years later ... And what of <br>
those at the ladder's bottom? Messrs. Cox &amp; Alm looked at their <br>
spending patterns over the century ... In 1920, the bottom quintile of <br>
earners consumed 70% of their income on necessities such as food, <br>
clothing and shelter. That fell to 57% by 1950, and 45% these days.&gt;<br>
<p>
I recall a number of other articles noting similar results; in <br>
particular, longitudinal studies showing how easy it was for the <br>
wealthy to lose their wealth and slip into lower income categories. <br>
 Of course there are *a few* ultra wealthy who would have to be <br>
awfully generous or stupid to lose their wealth.<br>
<p>
In short, this 'fuzzy threshold' you talk about is fuzzy only because <br>
it is so huge and, at least in the U.S., is liquid enough to cover the <br>
vast bulk of the population.<br>
<p>
Mark Crosby<br>
<p>
P.S. The problem with this thread is the assumption in the title that <br>
it's possible for any system to "solve everything" and the even worse <br>
assumption that the stagnation of 'balance' is desirable.<br>
