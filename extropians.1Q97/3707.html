I thought that some of you might be interested on this, as the future<br>
evolution of humanity, cultural revolutions, and transhumanism are all<br>
viable topics, but the majority of mailings will be related to<br>
traditional Evolutionary Theory.<br>
<p>

<p>
I would like to inform everyone here that there is a new mailing list<br>
for the discussion of Evolutionary Theory. Although there are many such<br>
lists that exist for biology, most of them are aimed at a very specific<br>
subset of specialists. The new list is designed for broad, intra<br>
discipine discussions on evolutionary topics. It would be an excellent<br>
resource for professionals to gather information about advances outside<br>
their normal scope (i.e. it will allow fossil hunters to talk to gene<br>
splicers).<br>
<p>
This site should not be used for the evolution/creation debate! <br>
<p>
<p>
The easiest way to subscribe fir this mailing list is to just visit the<br>
website and fill out the "quick form" right at the site. Point your<br>
browsers at <a href="http://www.esosoft.com/evolution/">http://www.esosoft.com/evolution/</a> to join the list.<br>
