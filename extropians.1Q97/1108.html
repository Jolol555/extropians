        I figure that it's been a few months since I've posted one of my<br>
longer poems to the lists.  It was written quite some time ago, so please<br>
notify me if you find any major fallacies.  (It's written without normal<br>
punctuation for a reason, BTW.)<br>
<p>
<p>
Outlook to See<br>
<p>
<p>
I.  Be Yonder, Beyonder<br>
<p>
So life isn=92t easy when you know its true source<br>
And days aren=92t long enough to let things run their course<br>
But I ask what can be done about the way things just go<br>
And I ponder the meanings of things I=92ll never know<br>
<p>
So things aren=92t strong enough to hold under your fears<br>
And valleys aren=92t deep enough to provide haven for your tears<br>
But without reason I try to let my heart just work it out<br>
And my silence makes your violence less than a shout<br>
<p>
But can you see what is done?<br>
Can you win what can=92t be won?<br>
Can you try to overcome your pain?<br>
Will you fail or will your madness reign?<br>
Can you sentence your truth=92s lies?<br>
Will you provoke your mind=92s sighs?<br>
Will you play the martyred-model role?<br>
Or will merit remove from you your goal?<br>
<p>
So the victor of a fall from pressured grace is so often overseen<br>
And the knowledge of life=92s treasure trove is a secret clandestine<br>
What might be the purpose of the world so unevolved?<br>
That eternal, immortal, infinite question can it ever be solved?<br>
<p>
By you?<br>
By you<br>
What they=92d said -was it untrue?<br>
By you<br>
<p>
<p>
II.  Apocalyptic Condolences<br>
<p>
The mountain of peace brought to ruin by starlight<br>
The river of depths never drowned out by the night<br>
As I dream what can happen and if I can ever have a part<br>
The sounds of wars unattached to me beating like a second heart<br>
<p>
Soldiers just like wolves -prowlers seeking psalms from dark<br>
Finding solace in the principles but baring teeth, ready to bark<br>
Not to cast a shadow upon the floorboards of the earth<br>
But to live and die impeded is that what our thoughts are worth?<br>
<p>
But do you even hear what I say?<br>
Can=92t you see it won=92t go away?<br>
Will it matter what I try to do?<br>
Must I leave it all up to you?<br>
Can=92t I stand up with my own legs?<br>
Can=92t I do what my free will begs?<br>
Will you destroy all that=92s germane?<br>
Or will all that is relevant still remain?<br>
<p>
<p>
III.  Ethic=92s Brutal Code<br>
<p>
When I was raised I was taught how shameful it was to need<br>
And freedom was not what the programming had decreed<br>
And now I see it just isn=92t right<br>
To go out without a fair fight<br>
<p>
Isn=92t it a false preparation to be confining the newly dead<br>
How can we know the meanings of life if they are just said<br>
Theories held together by the =91democracy of love=92<br>
To go down to the ground only to soar out beyond above<br>
<p>
To you?<br>
To you<br>
What they said -was it all true<br>
When there were lies were they from you?<br>
<p>
And the dire consequences of the manchild=92s judgment day<br>
The arm=E9d Armageddon=92s of the scholars through who they slay<br>
Turn their heads from wisdom to see their blood soaked hearts<br>
Arrows flung from bows, bows crafted from body parts<br>
<p>
Strangling the unspoken trying to make them live again<br>
=91Cause words can mean the world if they=92re structured from deep pain<br>
You see the horrors unleashed by those who know not what they are<br>
And where do you fit in to save us --where and how far<br>
<p>
Where are you now?<br>
Never there to keep<br>
Where are you now?<br>
There=92s a planet here to reap<br>
<p>
And I know you are wide and I know you are vast<br>
A universe is splendor and is presently future=92s past<br>
Our world is being slandered by the people just like me<br>
But I have no way out of it no celestial extropy<br>
<p>
<p>
IV.  Machine Heredity<br>
<p>
Our programming has failed we must abort original plan<br>
Our goals have truly paled is this the end of man?<br>
Wandering like sheep --just robots with no aim<br>
Waiting for an order by a space without a name<br>
<p>
Our individual pursuits have been assimilated by the whole<br>
Just a pack of prone recruits, just abstract without a soul<br>
Waiting to be led by a god or impetus<br>
Better to be left for dead than have a force commanding us<br>
<p>
Like you?<br>
Like you<br>
What they say will it be true<br>
Like you<br>
<p>
Humans are all just ready robots<br>
But over them we have one advantage<br>
Where they take what is merely given<br>
We can refuse the program=92s phage<br>
To live must we first die?<br>
For to die we must first be<br>
With the eyes of the blind<br>
I can still see<br>
<p>
