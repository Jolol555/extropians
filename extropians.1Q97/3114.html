<i>&gt;From David Cary,</i><br>
<p>
"I saw a small storm gathering on the floor overhead."<br>
..<br>
<i>&gt;Open Air Space Habitats</i><br>
..<br>
<i>&gt;The only example this author</i><br>
<i>&gt;knows of is Larry Niven's "Ringworld",</i><br>
<p>
Then you haven't seen _Legacy_ by Greg Bear.<br>
from chapter 1:<br>
"The entrance to the first chamber yawned wide, and we flew into <br>
brilliant<br>
tubelight.<br>
50 Km in diameter and 30 Km deep, ...<br>
<p>
[[Thanks, I'll add it.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The smaller the diameter of the rotating ring or cylinder, the less </i><br>
demands<br>
<i>&gt;are put on its main structural material.</i><br>
<p>
..I want equations :-). ...<br>
<p>
"floor-level air pressure" p in a rotating<br>
cylinder<br>
 stress_h = r*(pressure/t + density*a)<br>
 stress_a = r* pressure/2t<br>
<p>
[[Those is them!]]<br>
..<br>
<i>&gt;     This fabulous new material is the long sought Carbon-Carbon chain</i><br>
<i>&gt;molecule.</i><br>
<p>
So what's so fabulous about it ? Fill in the blanks in my chart:<br>
<p>
..Elastic Strength (stress_max)(in tension)<br>
150 Gpa  ("Buckyfiber")(Is this right ?)<br>
<p>
[[Buckyfiber appears to have two to threee times the tensile strength <br>
of<br>
diamond (50 Gpa). I got this particular value off the web (so it must <br>
be<br>
true, right?).]]<br>
<p>
Density<br>
 ???? Mg/m^3 C  <br>
<p>
[[I used a "standin" value of 3500 Kg/m^3. The safety factor is a <br>
reasonably slowly<br>
varying function of this, for densities between 2000-5000 kg/m^3.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The gathered ends of Buckyfibers are led off of the spools (which are </i><br>
also<br>
<i>&gt;spinning) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;brought to rendezvous with the outer surface of the spinning hoop.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps it would be easier to lay down stuff on the inner surface, <br>
allowing<br>
the radial acceleration (the imaginary "centrifugal force") to hold the<br>
loose fibers in place for a while, until we glue them down.<br>
<p>
[Not a bad idea.]]<br>
<p>
If the end of the strand comes off the spool too soon, or the strand <br>
breaks...<br>
A loose strand on the outer surface of that rotating cylinder ... would<br>
unwind, getting longer and more dangerous by the second.<br>
<p>
Makes for good drama :-/.<br>
<p>
[[Another reason to build two cylinders side-by-side. Also, these <br>
fibers are envisioned<br>
as being wound on as a multiple set, and at an angle. If one breaks, it <br>
should (?) get<br>
entangled by the others next to it and brought down.]]<br>
..<br>
<i>&gt;   Leaving this cylinder spinning slowly, we bring in fleets of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;Buckytube spools. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;fiber should be wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees</i><br>
<p>
I think that 1980's technology "graphite-fiber" pressure cylinders use <br>
the<br>
optimum 26.6 degrees. If I knew the ("floor-level") air pressure, wall<br>
thickness, and desired floor pseudo-gravity I think I could calculate <br>
the<br>
optimum angle (between 0 and 26.6 degrees).<br>
<p>
[[Sure- first you have to calculate the atmosphere load on the ends, <br>
and <br>
some average hoop load. The 10 degrees is just a punt.]]<br>
..<br>
<i>&gt;   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, </i><br>
meaning<br>
<i>&gt;each point on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;interior living surface has about 150 Km of atmosphere above it, and </i><br>
then<br>
<i>&gt;700 Km of</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing. Looking upward, at an angle, one can still see the stars.</i><br>
<p>
So, I could place my own personal communication satellites about 200 Km<br>
"up", and they would just stay there ?<br>
Interesting that there is *nothing* at the axis, it truly is an <br>
imaginary line.<br>
I like this. It allows you to build a spacedock in the exact center of <br>
the<br>
vessel, well-protected, from which you can either (a) push off and exit <br>
the<br>
station through either end, or (b) ride the elevators down to the <br>
surface<br>
for some heavy time.<br>
<p>
[[Just so.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   That was a lot of work, but what is a World worth?</i><br>
<p>
I liked your article.<br>
<p>
[[I'm glad you enjoy it!]]<br>
<p>
You might mention the 3 ways to get light to the plants;<br>
(a) direct sunlight through the hole in the ends (doesn't work for<br>
extremely long cylinders)<br>
(b) direct sunlight through transparent sectors in the cylinder (the<br>
transparent sectors obviously let light in through the holes in a "net" <br>
of<br>
filaments, with no slag attached to those sectors ... there are many<br>
variants; one of them is that the sunlight filters through the layer of<br>
atmosphere twice, once on the transparent side and once on the farmland<br>
side).<br>
(c) big light generators on the inside. This gives the best radiation<br>
shielding to the plants. The energy presumably comes from solar cells <br>
while<br>
near a star, nuclear energy while traveling between stars.<br>
<p>
[[I might, but space and time limitations in the article may not permit <br>
this.<br>
 There is a drawing that goes with this piece that shows these <br>
things.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From: Carl Feynman &lt;carlf@atg.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: Re: &gt;H Open Air Space Habitats</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;and another three</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;meters of slag should be sprayed on the outside, for radiation </i><br>
protection.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why spin the slag?  Put it in a nonrotating shell well away from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cylinder, and you save big on structural mass.</i><br>
<p>
Also, the maximum stresses (due to rotation) are on the outside. If <br>
this<br>
"slag" is less strong than the carbon fiber, it will flake off when the<br>
cylinder is brought up to speed. Very dangerous to ships in the area.<br>
<p>
[[The slag (this term is a holdover from when we made space habitats <br>
out <br>
of metal) is subject to one gravity directed radially out. A little <br>
fiber<br>
reinforcement should suffice to hold it in place. Consider that it <br>
deforms<br>
 plastically to relieve hoop stress.]]<br>
<p>
I've heard an interesting study in which it was claimed that, in some<br>
cases, *no* shielding was better than any reasonable amount of <br>
shielding.<br>
The argument was that, with no shielding, a high-energy cosmic ray <br>
would<br>
hit and utterly destroy one DNA molecule in an organism. However, with<br>
"small" amounts of shielding, the high-energy cosmic ray would hit the<br>
shield and generate lots and lots of low-energy particles, which would<br>
spread out and damage many, many cells of the organism. The authors <br>
argued<br>
that the amount of shielding which would be thick enough to catch all <br>
these<br>
low-energy particles was totally unreasonable.<br>
<p>
[[Yes, a little shielding is worse than none for the above reason. The <br>
author may<br>
have been referring to spacecraft rather than non-propelled structures. <br>
Many long<br>
duration mission proposals use a small "storm shelter" for solar storms <br>
consisting <br>
of a meter or two of material. I *think* 6 meters of stuff is adequate <br>
against the<br>
lower energy flux.]]<br>
<p>
.. 150 Gpa (!) as the Ultimate Tensile Stre=<br>
ngth<br>
<i>&gt;of Buckyfiber. I don=EDt know its speed of sound.]]</i><br>
<p>
I think the speed of sound is irrelevant.<br>
<p>
[[For pertubation analyses. I was not familiar with casting the <br>
performance<br>
in terms of tangential velocity, and thought Carl was referring to <br>
perturbations.]]<br>
<p>
A 1.0 Mm radius, 1 gee spacecraft has a v = sqrt(a*r) = 3.13 Km/s (well<br>
under v_max), so your numbers look physically possible (although the <br>
safety<br>
factor looks kind of small, less than 2).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[[I gave a safety factor of three to the shell for the slag and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere- so it will have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be thicker if you want serious dirt. I was assuming a few inches</i><br>
<i>&gt;average.]]</i><br>
<p>
[[Oops. I had the slag turned off when I did the safety factor. Guess <br>
you<br>
don't want me designing your house eh?]]<br>
<p>
Obviously if the ends are vented to space, the axis is in a vacuum -- <br>
but I<br>
keep thinking that if we sealed up the ends (or the tube was very <br>
long), we<br>
would have (significant) atmosphere at the axis. Perhaps my intuition <br>
is<br>
leading me astray.<br>
<p>
[[What would keep it there?<br>
<p>
Thank you very much for your interest and contribution.<br>
