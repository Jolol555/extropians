<i>&gt; I figure that it's better to be wrong than to keep quiet...at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; if your goal isn't impressing anyone, but is instead to solve all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; secrets of the Universe within five years.  If I'm wrong, I can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; corrected, and then I know something.  If I'm right, I'm right.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Silence is ignorance.  To err is to learn.</i><br>
<p>
Bravo!  I have never heard this put quite so succinctly and powerfully,<br>
and I must wholeheartedly agree.  I have often expressed a corrolary<br>
to this, that tolerance is the obligation of listeners, not speakers.<br>
Any suggestion that a man should refrain from expressing what he thinks<br>
in plain, straightforward language is contemptable.  Such repression<br>
is the enemy of the rational mind, a roadblock to knowledge.<br>
<p>
Rational minds cannot be offended.  "Taking offense" is a symptom of<br>
an intellectual pathology that the value of ideas can be judged by<br>
emotional response instead of reason.  To the extent one can express<br>
an idea in a listener's terms, and relate to him from his point of<br>
view, these are practical methods of communication; but one must never<br>
let such deference to your audience dilute the message itself.<br>
<p>
One does run the risk of being vocally, spectacularly, wrong.  Eli<br>
has assigned moral judgment to plants; I once proudly advocated<br>
government funding of research.  I shudder at those once eloquent<br>
pronouncements of mine, and how they might have affected the minds<br>
of others, but I cannot dwell on error.  I must simply say "I was<br>
wrong", and get on with the business of learning.  No apologies, no<br>
regrets, no limits.<br>
