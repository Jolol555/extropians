In a message dated 97-03-10 05:51:50 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; If most business can be moved online, then we enter a situation where<br>
<i> &gt;  countries will become the kind of proprietary communities I was talking</i><br>
<i> &gt;  about earlier, vying with each other to attract the most successful</i><br>
<i> &gt;  technomads in return for their taxes. This may be one important route</i><br>
<i> &gt;  towards the kind of societies we talk about, and is probably one</i><br>
important<br>
<i> &gt;  reason why governments are trying hard to screw up the Net.</i><br>
 <br>
 I didn't even think of this, even though I often carry on my business via<br>
 e-mail while I'm travelling and have even considered Costa Rica as a<br>
possible<br>
 personal emmigration destination from which I might be able to carry on some<br>
 of my business in the States and elsewhere as the Net gets a little better.<br>
  Mark, your point is very well taken.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Actually, this is the original reason why i began to investigate Libertarians<br>
in the first place, which led me to Extropy,  it seem highly probable that<br>
such an anarcho- cap world might occur spontaneously (before I ever<br>
encountered S.O) through the very offworld nature of 'cyber- business', with<br>
the chaning territories eroding the govt controls slowly bu t surely....and<br>
Libertarian ideas were the closest to "workable" that are around. However I<br>
still see many areas that are not ironed out and hope that people do not<br>
stick dogmatically to a premise that has yet to be ground tested. IMHO, and<br>
it is humble, believe me, we need a NEW paradigm. I did  not like Harry Brown<br>
telling me in his book how much better the fifites were.. and how we can<br>
return the constitution andour selves to the past... <br>
Cheers, <br>
