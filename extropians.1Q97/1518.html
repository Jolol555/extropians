<p>
The population explosion due to immortality is unlikely; immortality <br>
would just speed up the population growth somewhat, but the largest part <br>
of the growth would still be the birth of children, not the non-death of <br>
elders. <br>
<p>
But in principle you are right, if the population grows, then the amount <br>
of resources available to each individual in a finite system will shrink. <br>
The obvious solutions are to lower the birth rate or make more resources <br>
(of these two, most people only discuss the first). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A possible solution to the population explosion would be migration into</i><br>
<i>&gt; space, beginning with the terraformation and inhabitation of Mars and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Venus.</i><br>
<p>
As has been pointed out countless times, it won't work with <br>
flesh-and-blood humans - you would have to ship millions each day, and <br>
the inhabitants of Mars and Venus would soon be breeding too. O'Neill <br>
colonies might provide more living space using less materials (planets are <br>
so inefficient!), but they will of course not suffice either. In the long <br>
run, the only solution is a decrease in birth rate to match the death <br>
rate, or keep on spreading cubically. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My question is short and simple: How much would it cost in US$ to</i><br>
<i>&gt; terraform Mars, and who would pay?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it technically and economically feasible for such projects to begin</i><br>
<i>&gt; before 2100, by which time I think immortality will be within reach?</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't a dollar cost assume the existence of the US, a rather doubtful <br>
assumption in the 22nd century? :-) (BTW, what is the life expectancy of <br>
nations? Does anybody have any hard data?)<br>
<p>
But seriously, the main cost will likely not be in actually doing it, but<br>
researching how to do it. In one scenario you just launch a single<br>
standard nano-probe with some clever programming into space, and then lean<br>
back and watch the fireworks as the solar system is reorganized. The <br>
trick is to write that program, to take into account factors of <br>
astrophysics, climatology, geology, ecology and everything else, and that <br>
requires plenty of skill, knowledge, research and most likely <br>
experimentation. It is a bit like most drugs or software made today, the <br>
price mainly comes from the work that has gone into creating the product <br>
in the first place, not from the actual contents of the package.<br>
<p>
As for timescales, thay tend to be very ad hoc when it comes to this kind <br>
of technology (or any kind of technology). We know terraforming, or at <br>
least altering a planet, is physically possible and we know how it could <br>
in principle be done. But we cannot predict how the economy and policies <br>
of the late 21st century look like.<br>
