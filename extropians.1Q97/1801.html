Omega wrote 1/30/97: &lt;The problem with archetypes is that they can not be<br>
approached rationally, because each system of archetypes will define <br>
its own mutually incompatible logic, thus we have what we call dogma,<br>
political correctness, ideological purity, holy wars, witch hunts...&gt;<br>
<p>
There is anecdotal evidence for this if one chooses the anecdotes carefully<br>
to fit the theory.  In reality, if archetypes are turned towards truth,<br>
then even though they may be approaching truth from all directions, there<br>
will be at least *some* compatible logic at the borders of the meanings of<br>
the archetypes.  If, on the other hand, archetypes are turned away from<br>
truth, then "each system of archetypes will define its own mutually<br>
incompatible logic."  Systems of archetypes that are turned away from truth<br>
can still have the appearance of rationality to those who subscribe to<br>
coherence theories of truth (the Quinian stance), though not the reality of<br>
rationality.  Systems of archetypes that are turned towards the truth, even<br>
if only striking a tangentially glancing blow, will contain a shred of<br>
potentially discoverable rationality, at least to those who subscribe to<br>
correspondence theories of truth (the Kantian stance).<br>

&lt;The genius of Feynman was often attributed to the fact that in the middle<br>
of a difficult problem, he would stop what he was doing and suddenly shift<br>
to a different viewpoint.&gt;<br>
<p>
I would like to point out that this technique was in the "philosophical<br>
air" at the time of Feynman's early productive years, not to take anything<br>
away from Feynman's accomplishments at all, but to show the connection<br>
between *what* he thought and *how* he thought, specifically his ideas<br>
about summing-over-the-histories that eventually made QED so successful.  I<br>
got the following quoted material from "Analytic Philosophy" Ed. Barry<br>
Gross (1970):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Leibniz's "Monadology", Bertrand Russell took the idea of each mind</i><br>
viewing the world from a unique perspective at any given moment.  "Each<br>
observer has a space private to him in which all his sense data appear and<br>
the totality of these data at any time make up the perspective.  The<br>
history of all perspectives of such an observer is just the history of<br>
certain of his mental functionings.  On the other hand, the thing or object<br>
in the world is a bundle of all the events which consist of the various<br>
appearances of it ­ the sum of all its actual and possible appearances. <br>
The table, or physical object, is now defined as the class or system of all<br>
the possible perspectives of it.  The appearances are not in the object nor<br>
are they parts of its surface.  Rather, what we call the object is the sum<br>
of all its possible and actual appearances."<br>
<p>
Voila!  Sum-over-the-perspectives/sum-over-the-histories describes reality.<br>
 Russell (the positivists) and independently Edmund Husserl, were working<br>
on this line at about the same time roughly a full generation before<br>
Feynman's breakthroughs, but Sartre picked it up and spread it around more<br>
contemporaneously.<br>
<p>
"Russell postulates a single space in which all the points of view or<br>
perspectives are themselves located.  There are many actual private spaces,<br>
an infinite number of possible ones, but only one public space or<br>
perspective space which contains them all."<br>
<p>
"Only one perspective space" is the same idea as the space-time point<br>
common to all events referred to in other recent posts, published the year<br>
before Einstein's "General Relativity."<br>
<p>
&lt;...the incompleteness of one coordinate space for defining in a simple<br>
form all possible localizations and correlations that can exist within<br>
mathematical reality.  In math these are the spaces that are defined by the<br>
myriad Fourier waveform families....  [T]he brain is well known to be<br>
loaded with data patterns that have been through Fourier transforms<br>
(leading to the periodic talk about "holographic" memory/processing). <br>
However when we add in the intracellular microtubules which operate in the<br>
low GHz range, everything falls into place now as we now find integrated<br>
together in the wetware of the brain, the necessary structures for working<br>
in two conjugate waveform spaces; exactly what we would suspect would be<br>
needed for a cognitive device that operates within a generalized set of<br>
Fourier spaces.&gt;<br>
<p>
Between your Fourier spaces description above, and your later use of<br>
"memes" (which I'm skeptical of), I believe I recognize what I refer to as<br>
"conceptual attractors," or something closely related to it.  We're in<br>
neighboring Fourier spaces looking at a similar problem set, is how I<br>
believe you would put it.<br>
<p>
I am not sure how generalized the set of Fourier spaces is that we operate<br>
within.  Evolutionarily, we should expect that the overall set should not<br>
be very large, because we haven't been subjected to an excessively mutable<br>
environment in our brief history.<br>
<p>
J.A. Scott Kelso, in "Dynamic Patterns:  The Self-Organization of Brain and<br>
Behavior" (1995) reported on using SQUID arrays to capture spatial patterns<br>
of brain activity and then applied a decomposition technique (the<br>
Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion) to model how these evolved in time.  "The<br>
idea is to see whether an essentially infinite-dimensional system, the<br>
human brain with around 100 billion neurons and 60 trillion synapses,<br>
exhibits a small (or at least restricted) set of time-varying global modes.<br>
 The patterns or modes of brain activity are spatially coherent, but their<br>
temporal evolution is complex.  By modeling switching dynamics and its<br>
multistability, this theory connects brain events (internal behavior) to<br>
behavioral events (overt behavior).... the waxing and waning of modes is a<br>
result of nonlinear coupling between the outside world and the internal<br>
spatial modes of the brain.  One can see... that at least seven coherent<br>
spatial modes are present in the brain, the contributions of which may vary<br>
dynamically according to the kinds of tasks people (and brains) have to<br>
perform.  It's tempting to speculate that each of us is born with a brain<br>
that operates globally in a relatively small set of basic modes whose<br>
contributions vary with life's trials and tribulations."<br>
<p>
Only seven sets!  The tests are only beginning, but I would be very<br>
surprised if we turn out to be operating in many diverse patterns, our<br>
environment does not present us with utter chaos, rather with temporally<br>
stable packages of constraints.<br>
<p>
&lt;This is next leads us into the problem of "archetypal rationality".  For <br>
small problems, holding a few dozen Fourier spaces in ones head simultan-<br>
eously, and picking an answer from some suitably localized one is no big<br>
deal, but as the problems get larger and larger, our ability to hold simul-<br>
taneous viewpoints decreases accordingly.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is quite an apt description of how my thought processes work, I have<br>
this huge ball of working concepts gyrating throughout many frameworks of<br>
structured dormant concepts, performing inter-Fourier-spatial translations<br>
and intra-Fourier-spatial recognitions.  The problem sets in play at any<br>
one time dictate the viscosity and diffusion of the working concepts<br>
throughout the whole mess.<br>
<p>
Technically, it is not the case that "as the problem sets get larger and<br>
larger, our ability to hold simultaneous viewpoints decreases," it is the<br>
old uncertainty principle at work, or the depth vs. breadth nonsimultaneity<br>
principle.  No brain, no matter what its capacity, can escape the physical<br>
constraints (really the linear temporal constraint) of what David Gelernter<br>
referred to as the "spectrum of focus," that sliding scale of attention<br>
from high-focus analytic to mid-focus emotional to low-focus associative<br>
imagination.  Any thought, no matter how potent the intelligence is, will<br>
land at only one point on this attention scale at any moment in time.  A<br>
superintelligence that could plunge to an incredible analytical depth of a<br>
problem would be a high-falutin' geek; that could spread to an incredible<br>
imaginative breadth of a problem would be a hepped-up mystic.<br>
<p>
&lt;Along this line, brain plasticity may well function by simply reinforcing<br>
certain Fourier spaces at the expense of the general set.&gt;<br>
<p>
I think you mean just the opposite of this, brain plasticity, which is at<br>
maximum levels in utero and in infancy, is more closely related to the<br>
general set.  The process of reinforcing certain spaces describes not brain<br>
plasticity, but brain sludge.  Evolutionarily, brain sludge enhances the<br>
potential for preservation if the environment is not changing too rapidly,<br>
brain plasticity is preferable only in chaotic environments.<br>
<p>
&lt;Each Fourier space has, quite simply, its own logic.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is an important consideration, the nature of knowledge systems,<br>
including scientific knowledge, is radically local.  It's why physicists<br>
should never become biologists, or worse yet, neuroscientists.  It's why<br>
mixing computer and human metaphors is so cludgy.  However, we must be very<br>
careful not to fall into compost-modern relativism and get lost in pure<br>
coherency theories of truth.  We must be aware that each Fourier space will<br>
be turned towards or away from truth, that not all Fourier spaces are<br>
created equal with respect to their utility for our preservation.<br>
<p>
To help show what I mean, by expanding into a few other Fourier spaces, I<br>
would like to start with the example from above about the preferred seven<br>
coherent brain activity spatial patterns.  Then, a couple examples about<br>
preferred protein folding pathways and preferred protein design pathways.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "Science" 2 August, 1996: 595-602.  Holm, Lisa &amp; Sander, Chris. </i><br>
"Mapping the Protein Universe":<br>
<p>
"Conceptually, each protein structure may be imagined as a point in an<br>
abstract, high-dimensional fold space.  At close range in this fold space,<br>
clusters represent protein families related through strong functional<br>
constraints...  At intermediate range, clusters are related by shape<br>
similarity that does not necessarily reflect similarity of biological<br>
function.  At long range, the overall distribution of folds is dominated by<br>
five densely populated regions, which we call attractors.  [W]e put forward<br>
the hypothesis that these attractors represent both dominant folding<br>
pathways and evolutionary sinks that are the result of physical<br>
constraints.  Selective pressure in evolution from random or partially<br>
random sequences would be more likely to result in specifically folded<br>
stable structures in one of these regions."<br>
<p>
Only five preferred protein foldability regions here.  The next example is<br>
from the same issue of "Science" pg. 610.  Kardar, Mehran.  "Which Came<br>
First, Protein Sequence or Structure?":<br>
<p>
"Whereas 'foldability' focuses on the [amino acid] sequence, selecting<br>
potentially functional ones... 'designability,'... is based on the<br>
structure of resulting protein.  This concept is quantified by measuring<br>
the number of sequences that uniquely fold into a particular structure<br>
(foldability is thus implicitly included).  A great technical achievement<br>
of these authors is that they are able, for the first time, to compute the<br>
energies of all 103,346 structures, for all 2^27 possible sequences of<br>
27-mers....  Some structures are not designable as they do not correspond<br>
to the ground state of any sequence; the best structure is obtained from<br>
3794 sequences.  Several interesting patterns emerge from the enumeration. <br>
(i) At the tail of the distribution, there are structures that are highly<br>
designable:  the number of sequences that fold into them is much greater<br>
than expected from simple probability distributions.  (ii) These structures<br>
have, on average, a larger gap to their first excited state, making them<br>
thermodynamically more stable.  (iii)  The well-designed structures are<br>
also more robust against simple changes in the sequence (random mutations).<br>
 Thus, a major claim... is that the designability principle unites several<br>
properties (thermodynamic stability and mutational plasticity) occurring in<br>
real proteins."<br>
<p>
Here we have only a few thousand preferred protein designs out of over a<br>
hundred thousand possible.  Also, the linkage of stability and plasticity<br>
at the protein level is exactly analogous to the depth vs. breadth<br>
situation in the cognitive focus of attention.  Finally a short example of<br>
preferred evolutionary pathways from Stuart Kauffman's "Origins of Order"<br>
(1993):  "Whether one is comfortable with the idea or not, the existence of<br>
preferred 'directions' of alteration of developmental pathways implies<br>
something like 'orthogenesis' ­ a tendency of evolution to occur in<br>
preferred directions not because of selection constraints but because the<br>
underlying system has preferred directions of change in the face of<br>
*random* mutations."<br>
<p>
&lt;...the frequency component of this generalized Fourier processor is not<br>
limited to the brain, but exists in all eukaryotic cells, thus easily<br>
spilling over into the rest of the body (and possibly beyond the body).&gt;<br>
<p>
This would be helpful in explaining the increasingly well documented<br>
cognitive experience of tacit knowledge and implicit perception.<br>
<p>
&lt;We may yet find that building efficient AI and upload capable devices<br>
still<br>
requires the use of at least some "wetware" as this meat in our bodies is <br>
called.&gt;<br>
<p>
If each Fourier space is discrete, then the boundaries between them must be<br>
analog for jumping to occur.  Thus, I would agree with you that an upload<br>
capable device must be a mix of digital and analog computers, most probably<br>
in roughly the estimated 20% digital-80% analog mix of neurochemical<br>
interactions we currently possess.  Perhaps it is four times more<br>
evolutionarily important to jump boundaries than it is to settle into a<br>
Fourier space.  Perhaps each Fourier space is at minimum a tetrahedron with<br>
four faces.  Who knows?  Maybe Bucky Fuller had a few useful guesses at<br>
what is going on, the shotgun approach is not a bad one when trying to hit<br>
large, amorphous objects.  As he monotonously said "Angle and frequency<br>
modulation exclusively define all experiences."<br>
