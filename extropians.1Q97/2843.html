<i>&gt;Another area where people feel they know more than the professionals</i><br>
<i>&gt;is sports. [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What do professional sports have in common with politics?</i><br>
<p>
Ritual.  I'm reading a book called "The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life,"<br>
by Thomas Moore.  Moore talks about sports as providing occasion to<br>
contemplate (not the same as think about) the big issues of life (and<br>
this is the chapter I'm reading right now):<br>
<p>
"Sports are especially important in our culture because apparently the soul<br>
needs to contemplate its own reality much more frequently<br>
than our style of life allows.  Some cultures are almost entirely<br>
ritualistic and poetic, while our culture sees ordinary life as separate<br>
from poetry and religion.  We have the arts, religion, and sports to<br>
offer us the kind of ritual contemplation we need, but with the arts<br>
made marginal to the culture and with religion in relative decline,<br>
especially in its communal ritual elements [he means as opposed to the<br>
superstitious and moralistic elements], we are left with sports as a<br>
last resort."<br>
<p>
Sports, including politics, provide something to care and have opinions<br>
about, without the consequences, a big screen...  Oh, of course, did<br>
someone mention how people set themselves up as experts on how<br>
celebrities ought to live?<br>
<p>
Minsky called music "chewing gum for the mind."  Similarly rituals like<br>
politics are chewing gum for the heart and soul.  (But I hope in both<br>
cases the danger of these dismissive phrases is apparent.)<br>
