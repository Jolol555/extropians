<i>&gt;Gee, Chris, are you sure you don't work for the marketing dept at pointcast?</i><br>
<p>
Hehehe, nope. I'm just a worshipper and promoter of technology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This sounds pretty nice, but as I said I'm not sure there is enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;information being produced in the world of the type that I CRAVE that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it can come in 24 hours a day.  I might have to settle with satisfying</i><br>
<i>&gt;my FUCKING ADDICTION only, say, 3 hours a day.  Poor me.</i><br>
<p>
hehe. I'm sure there is enough information being produced. In fact... I<br>
assure you. Information can be a drug as much as any chemical can.<br>
Entertain yourself to death with information aimed directly at your<br>
personal id. We will all end up like Bill Gates, sitting at our big screen<br>
tvs or using virtual goggles 24 hours a day selecting the information we<br>
find most promising and saving that for later in an endless list of<br>
bookmarks we could never control.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately I haven't seen many specifics of why changing the delivery</i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanism is going to magically cause these filtering mechanisms to appear.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So I will be skeptical about Chris's vision for a while longer.</i><br>
<p>
Collective intelligence and Profiles is the key.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is there any software out there where you can tell it a set of web pages</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you like to monitor, and it will go out and check them all to see</i><br>
<i>&gt;which if any have changed since your last visit?  It seems to me that this</i><br>
<i>&gt;would provide a lot of the benefits touted for push.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps the program could send your bookmarks to a server on the web using<br>
encryption to ensure everything is secure and compare your bookmarks with<br>
others and create a profile of your interests.<br>
