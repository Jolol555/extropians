<i>&gt; I am aware that this might be a little off subject but it is one of my</i><br>

<i>&gt; changing their views.  Right now my current goal is having someone say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "That's a good argument, but I still believe."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm posting this now because I actually met someone who I did not have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; give them a God to believe in.  Usually a theist's conception of their god</i><br>
<i>&gt; is so underdeveloped the first step is to get a definition.  I'll outline</i><br>
<i>&gt; my best argument so far.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, I ask a question:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is God omniscient?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the answer is no, than I'm sunk because then my arguement is that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person could become God and that sort of blasphemy tends to block the minds</i><br>
<i>&gt; quickly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the answer is yes, than it gets interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I use the maximum possible definition of ominiscent.  At this point I</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminate many other people who just don't follow what comes next.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If a being is omniscent then it knows the position and state of every</i><br>
<i>&gt; particle in the universe.  Of course, to get that kind of resolution, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; being would need the entire universe as a storage device.  Since adding any</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought to this being would result in more information in the universe we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are left with the problem of infinite simulations within simulations.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; leads to paradox and a paradox is the conclusion of a negative proof.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I need some feedback on this.  I want to refine this arguement until there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are as few scientific holes in it as possible.  I would appreciate all</i><br>
<i>&gt; help.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Dan,<br>
<p>
I've tried this argument before.  What I ususally get back is a<br>
redefinition of "absolute onminiscience" along the following lines:<br>
<p>
"Hey, to be absolutely omniscient you only need to know every principle<br>
that relates to a particle or system.  You do not need to know every<br>
characteristic about every particle and system in existence at one point<br>
in time.  Besides, since god is also omnipotent, he has an infinitum of<br>
time periods at his behest. he can store the knowledge eons from now"<br>
<p>
Dan, theists are predictable in that they always default to semantical<br>
legerdemain.  You'll soon get sick at their changing the meaning of key<br>
words as you try to nail down their inconsistencies.<br>
<p>
There are usually three ways they finish any argument:<br>
<p>
	1) Antics with semantics as mentioned above.<br>
	2) "Hey, you gotta believe in something!" ...as long as it's an<br>
	    animated supreme being.<br>
	3) "Reason is rooted in faith."  This is actually part of "finish #1"<br>
	    mentioned above but it deserves special notice since it's usally <br>
	    the ending argument that most scholastic theists use. See 	    	  <br>
"Pan-critical Reason" at the Extropian FAQ.<br>
<p>
I've got to admit that I miss arguing with theists about gods existence.<br>
I spend most of my time these days arguing politics and possible<br>
extropian futures.  Most of the people with whom I argue are "well<br>
educated" but seem to not know the basics of neither economics nor the<br>
history of western civilization. At least most theists know religion!<br>
