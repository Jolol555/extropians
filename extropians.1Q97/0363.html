Still need to define genius, of course, and then make a test.  What<br>
_are_ people's definitions of geniuses?  By my scale, males and females<br>
are even: I'm not sure I personally know any.  Would be surprised if I<br>
did.  I'm not sure offhand that I know *of* any.  Or what my definition<br>
is.  Whups.<br>

As for SATs, Michael Lorrey asks when were they discredited.  When were<br>
they credited, or rather proven to within some error, to measure<br>
anything besides the possession of certain knowledge and basic skills<br>
*AND* the ability or confidence to summon such knowledge under the<br>
stressful and unnatural conditions of a proctored multiple-choice test.<br>
