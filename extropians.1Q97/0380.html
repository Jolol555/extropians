I think you misrepresent the "cybergnostic" position; even the most <br>
die-hard cybergnosticist will acknowledge that the information has to be <br>
processed somewhere (although the Moravecian platonic materialists <br>
suggest that the processing is central, and the implementations(s) are <br>
contingent). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's distressing to</i><br>

<p>
Yes. But it may be easy to slip into it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am quite fond of my body. I find it wanting, primarily, in only</i><br>
<i>&gt; two areas: the planned obsolescence (accumulated delayed-action</i><br>
<i>&gt; death genes... our evolutionary conditions did nothing to weed out</i><br>
<i>&gt; fatal mutations that don't express until after 30 or so) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; inability to function under the conditions that obtain in most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the physical universe. </i><br>
<p>
I sometimes support the cybergnostic position; I often feel my body as a<br>
real limitation since it distracts me from my work with physical demands<br>
and limitations, singular location, risk for damage or disease and the<br>
subtle effects of (say) a tired muscle on my cognition. I would be very<br>
happy to spend much of my time without it, only to use the body for what<br>
it is truly good for: sensual exploration of the physical world. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I can't even form a coherent notion of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what it would be like to exist without a body. </i><br>
<p>
Have you gone into a "hacker trance" or "email trance"? It sometimes<br>
happens to me as I use a computer: everything that is outside the virtual<br>
desktop fades away, and the world becomes information. I don't think about<br>
my chair, how I write on the keyboard or move the mouse, I just exist as a<br>
disembodied consciousness influencing the digital world by will alone.<br>
This is the kind of existence I would like to use in my "working mode". <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Utility fog might </i><br>
<i>&gt; work nicely, if it can be built.  ;)</i><br>
<p>
A bit light, isn't it? What to do when there is a strong wind? :-)<br>
I would opt for a more solid mesoscale structure.<br>
