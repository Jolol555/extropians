My statement regarding "good" and "bad" memes has been somewhat<br>
misinterpreted on this list, and possibly mistated by me.<br>
<p>
There are a number of ways to look at this.  First, you can define<br>
"goodness" in either an absolute or relative sense.  I chose absolute.<br>
Second, you can observe a meme either from the perspective of that meme or<br>
from the perspective of the memetic host.<br>
<p>
Now for a more detailed explanation of my theories on memetics:<br>
<p>
The difference between a bad meme and a good meme is the difference between<br>
a parasite and a symbiote.  In a relative sense, a bad meme may APPEAR to be<br>
a "good" meme to the sentient host (i.e. human), but a bad meme is *always*<br>
bad in an absolute sense.  Much of the RELATIVE "goodness" in an ABSOLUTELY<br>
bad but relatively "good" meme is superficial at best.  In fact, much of the<br>
"goodness" is also not absolute in any sense.  Example:  If you are a poor,<br>
ignorant, unhappy redneck, you are very likely go to church.  Why?  Because<br>
it makes you feel better about being poor, ignorant, and unhappy.<br>
Nonetheless, you are *still* poor, ignorant, unhappy.  An absolutely good<br>
meme would be for the poor, ignorant, unhappy redneck to put forth the<br>
effort to become educated and pursue higher ambitions, or whatever would<br>
reverse his pathetic condition.<br>
<p>
KEY POINT HERE:<br>
<p>
Notice some fundamental differences between good and bad memes (absolute<br>
sense).  Good memes attack the cause, bad memes attack the symptoms.  People<br>
are more likely to propagate RELATIVELY good memes because they can more<br>
closely identify with symptoms than causes.  The feedback loop is *much*<br>
tighter for relatively good memes.  An absolutely good meme is only likely<br>
to propagate if it *also* fixes the short-term symptoms as well (i.e. is a<br>
relatively good meme).  Therefore, the *key* to memetic propagation is<br>
relative goodness.<br>
<p>
<p>
A meme is a non-moral agent.  It's attempts to propagate are morally<br>
neutral.    Moral value should only be attached to the ideas encapsulated<br>
within the meme.  Therefore, the "good"ness of a meme should only be<br>
evaluated from the perspective of the sentient host.  Analogy:  It is like a<br>
mosquito (which is neither good or bad) which may propagate malaria<br>
(obviously bad).  There is nothing absolutely bad about a mosquito following<br>
its nature, and the same applies to a meme.  We don't view a mosquito as bad<br>
because it is a mosquito, we only view a mosquito as bad because it contains<br>
malaria.<br>
<p>
<p>
This is enough for now.  Dissect at will...<br>
