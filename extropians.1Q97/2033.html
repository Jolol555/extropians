First, get a grip. It sounds like your parents are emotional and over<br>
reacting. The best defense is calm, even tempered responses to their<br>
threats.  Assure your parents that you love them (if indeed you do.) Have a<br>
friend forward messages to you and delete any that are provocative.  If you<br>
have any left, put them on disk. Purchase a post office box and subscribe to<br>
Extropy magazine or the Extropy Institute to receive the newsletter and any<br>
and all other information on what's happening. Find out what extropians live<br>
in your area and contact them for parties. <br>
