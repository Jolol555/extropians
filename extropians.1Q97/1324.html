Eliezer Yudkowsky:<br>
<i>&gt;My response is, as always, "Insufficient Data".  I acknowledge that</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are major, evolved, emotional differences between the sexes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;although not necessarily ones that could not be overcome by upbringing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, I seem to recall running through several case histories of</i><br>
<i>&gt;feminized boys and androgenized women, some of which were (as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt;known) upbringing-induced and not a testosterone imbanance. </i><br>
<p>
You claim over and over again to be some kind of genius.  Well, now <br>
it is time for me to take off my gloves and tell you that you are now <br>
speaking 'genius' to 'genius' (according to my IQ and your assertion).  <br>
<p>
Your above statement is one of the most unlearned, unsubstantiated, out-moded <br>
bits of tripe I've read in a long time, and I would thank you in the <br>
future to actually cite these studies you claim to have read.  The fields of <br>
psychiatry and social psychology are challenging the very instruments <br>
through which 'gender' is measured [Handel/Salit 1985, et al], and the <br>
Kinsey Sex Institute Report has made unequivocal medical statements <br>
regarding persons who do not conform to biological gender stereotypes <br>
[pp. 374-76].  <br>
<p>
You and Lyle can continue to pat each other on the back regarding how <br>
smart each of you are, but it you are going to present opinion in the <br>
guise of erudite statement, I suggest that you do your homework <br>
first.  As humans continue to evolve and more persons score as <br>
androgynes on the Bem Sex Instrument, it becomes increasingly useless <br>
to cling to outdated studies and memes.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
