I was outraged recently over Disney's decision to alter their "Pirates of<br>
the Caribbean" ride because it portrayed pirates chasing after women. What<br>
did pirates do? They raped and pillaged! Why attempt to make history PC? It<br>
wasn't! You cannot change history. Watch, next they'll be putting in female<br>
pirates into the attraction. This has nothing to do with sexism, it's just<br>
accurately portraying a time period. I already know quite a few people who<br>
will no longer go on that ride because Disney has made this decision. Too<br>
bad there isn't a means to make a ride such as this historical and unable<br>
to be altered. Mauling a historical theme park attraction by making it more<br>
PC is akin to Napoleon having his troops fire cannonballs at the sphinx.<br>
Well, at least they haven't made the Florida one PC yet. Too bad they did<br>
this because there are not very many attractions at Disneyland as there are<br>
at Six Flags Magic Mountain so I guess I'll be spending lots more time at<br>
the latter. I may go on the ride one last time to see how pathetic they've<br>
made it but that's it for me. They might as well close it down because many<br>
people go to that ride purely for the memories associated with it. It's<br>
just not the same.<br>
