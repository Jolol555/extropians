From: Anders Sandberg &lt;nv91-asa@nada.kth.se&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; In my personal ethical system, I regard complex, diverse systems as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental good (this is a completely arbitrary basis, but it works quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; well). This of course implies that a biosphere is something *very*</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable, and that keeping it viable and diverse is an ethical act. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; also implies that ideally, I should not interfere in it to decrease its</i><br>
<i>&gt; (long run) diversity, and that to achieve this I should also try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; convince others about the same thing (see the meme? :-). </i><br>
<p>
How about interfering to increase its diversity?  Should we seek out<br>
forests which are dominated by one kind of tree, and strive to introduce<br>
competitors?  Irrigate the desert?<br>
<p>
This seems different from traditional environmentalism.  Environmentalists<br>
would usually seek to preserve even rather stark ecosystems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, how protection and extension of the biosphere should </i><br>
<i>&gt; be implemented in practice, that is another matter; there are several </i><br>
<i>&gt; approaches ranging from fiat by nanotechnological superiority to free </i><br>
<i>&gt; markets, and the debate between them tends to run hot.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps technology will soon vastly outdo nature in generation of<br>
diversity, comparable to the degree by which rockets outpace cougars.<br>
Our nanites and computers will create ecosystems far exceeding the<br>
complexity and diversity nature has been able to clumsily stumble upon in<br>
its few billion years of undirected evolution.  If so, then demolishing<br>
the rain forests and replacing them with the ultra-exotic designed<br>
ecosystems of the future may be the road to maximal diversity.  I don't<br>
think we'll sign up many traditional environmentalists for this program.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW, the widespread belief that we are nearing an ecological catastrophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; might in some sense be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many people seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; become passivated by this idea, thinking that it is inevitable and hence</i><br>
<i>&gt; not doing anything practical about it. And the people who become activated</i><br>
<i>&gt; by it unfortunately tends to demand harsh solutions with little regard for</i><br>
<i>&gt; other opinions (after all, they are saving the world). Just goes to show</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we need to develop the human mind a bit further... </i><br>
<p>
The February 1997 issue of Wired has a nice article on Julian Simon and<br>
his refutations of environmental catastrophism.  I am optimistic that<br>
the continual failures of the apocalyptic predictions will eventually sink<br>
in, and that in the next decade we will see a retreat from environmentalism.<br>
