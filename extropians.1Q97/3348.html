In a message dated 97-03-08 13:22:37 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; More than one week BEFORE the publication of the paper  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Before publication and AFTER peer review of the paper.  That's is no problem.<br>
 <br>
<p>
You still don't say anything about the first discovery in France.  Why not?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;How convient to substitute a paper on another virus for the one we are<br>
talking about.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I just don't follow you.  So what, HIV was renamed from HTLV-III.   It is the<br>
same virus.  Changing of nomenclature is normal in microbiology.  What's so<br>
abnormal about that?  <br>
<p>
There is nothing strange about Gallo finding HTLV-I in an AIDS patient.  He<br>
said he had isolated it from AIDS patient but was not sure if it actually<br>
caused AIDS.  Again, not unusual.  HTLV -1 was the first human retrovirus<br>
discovered in 1976 by Asher Gibbs and Gajdusek. Latency of HTLV-1 is very<br>
long 10-40 years (MCM 1991 page 1024), like HIV.  HTLV-I and HTLV-II are<br>
prevalent in IV drug users.  <br>
