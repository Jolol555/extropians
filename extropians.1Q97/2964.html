  convincing them would be easier with physical removal or<br>
  suppressing.<br>

I'm no neurophysiologist, but isn't the brain required to sustain<br>
autonomous activity such as respiration, digestion, etcettera. If you<br>
remove the brain, then you<br>
have to have something in its place to take care of these activities.<br>
Also, the muscles will atrophy if they are not used, again, something<br>
which requires a brain, though a specialized TENS unit might suffice to<br>
stimulate activity in the muscles. I don't imagine we will be creating<br>
clones without brains anytime soon.<br>

I'm writing this Email with Netscape Communicator P2. Communicator only<br>
writes Email in html, so if your Email reader doesn't support html tags<br>
you may have a bunch of "noise" in this and future messages from me. My<br>
apologies.<br>
