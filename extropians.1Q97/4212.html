<i>&gt; Eugene, I found your dialogue informative, but we have a major</i><br>

 <br>
The distinction between natural and artifical is artificial. Man is <br>
product of evolution, a natural process. Our technological designs shows <br>
darwinian signatures, we ourselves are subject to darwinian selection, <br>
though the fitness function shows alarming dynamics, even our thinking <br>
process might be based on mutation and darwinian selection on cortex module <br>
level. We might stand onto our heads, we still would be natural. <br>
<p>
I'd say ALife rendition vs. life is a snuff movie, not a fake.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; why they call it *artificial* life. It is not real. If I am to be</i><br>
<p>
In my interpretation, I do not care about the origin of the process, solely <br>
about its properties. If the life nucleation event on Earth was caused by a <br>
cruising alien probe, are we then artificial? And if we are, has this <br>
any impacts on our daily life? This discussion reminds me of medival <br>
scholastics, on the properties of souls, by definition nonimmanent, <br>
undetectable entities.<br>
<p>

<p>
If I would perform the cruel trick of anaesthesizing you during your <br>
sleep, vitrifying you, then uploading (Omega Uploads Ultd.) you and your <br>
entire room, there would be no perceivable discontinuity. You would need <br>
start doing physical experiments to find inconsistancies.<br>
<p>
(This is assuming perfect uploads, with nonperceivable neural damage, and <br>
fakespace renderer artfacts also distinctly perception-subthreshold. The <br>
first uploads will sure be different, Frankensteinian, crude. It will be <br>
riddled with artefacts, most of them not very pleasant).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; emotions that I can really feel and experience. I would not accept a</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceptual abstraction of emotions that merely effected and did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; affect me. </i><br>
<p>
You've run into that most cruel trap, fencing with words in a room full of <br>
smoke and mirrors. I've seen many who never made to escape from there.<br>
 <br>
Concepts are our tools, choose only the suitable, and use them wisely.<br>
I wish you luck.  En garde.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In your dialogue you refer to "Alife" rather than "Artificial life". I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know this is common practice, but there might be another level of denial</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved. </i><br>
<p>
ALife is shorter. <br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, current critters are way below the nematode level. The <br>
particular physics of the ALife implementation are highly simplified. It <br>
is a caricature, yet current models do not aspire to mirror reality. <br>
There are just experiments to elucidate certain aspects of artificial <br>
ecologies, cooperation strategies, neodarwinian nonlinearities. <br>
<p>
An upload otoh is a very accurate copy, though certainly not <br>
at individual ion channel activity level. Nobody in the ALife community <br>
is talking about uploads yet. Most neurosci, and computational neurosci <br>
guys merely snicker if you utter "upload" in their presence. Those who<br>
don't, have never heard that term. We'll live and see, who is right. <br>
