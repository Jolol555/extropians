        I excluded nobility because women (as were men) were appointed and<br>
conditioned to be noble.  In other words, they didn't have to risk their<br>
careers or lives to be noble...it was taken for granted that they were of<br>
noble blood (which was allegedly God-chosen). <br>

        She was the first notable feminist in history.  Though I myself<br>
don't know a lot about her, I know that she was one of the first advocates<br>
of gender equality.  Needless to say, she was killed by men.<br>
