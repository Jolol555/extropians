David Levy, an economic historian at George Mason University, has a<br>
paper and an upcoming book called "How the Dismal Science Got Its Name".<br>
<p>
The paper's abstract is: <br>
<p>
  Thomas Carlyle in his "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question"<br>
  was apppalled that the classical British economists considered blacks<br>
  to be fully human.  Carlyle said that economists did not understand<br>
  that blacks could not be persuaded to work by money, they had to be<br>
  whipped.  Thus the economists' anti-racisms is the basis of the<br>
  allegation of our name, the "dismal science.<br>
<p>
Carlyle is a famous racist, and was one of Hitler's favorite authors. <br>
Charles Dickens dedicated his 1854 "Hard Times" to Carlyle. <br>
<p>
These classical British were also pro-birth-control.  I think Mills<br>
got thrown into jail for distributing a phamplet on the topic. <br>
