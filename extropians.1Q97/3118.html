I've recently taken interest in reading about hypertext, a decentralized<br>
system for fine-grained bi-directional linking in writing.  For a good<br>
description, read Drexler's "Hypertext Publishing and the Evolution of<br>
Knowledge," which makes an effective argument for hypertext.<br>
<a href="http://www.asiapac.com/Hypertext/HypertextPublishingKED.html">http://www.asiapac.com/Hypertext/HypertextPublishingKED.html</a><br>
<p>
I began to think about how such a system could be implemented over the<br>
existing Internet.  As I thought about it, I realized that through some<br>
small changes in the protocol, Usenet already provides an ideal system<br>
for implementing hypertext.  It already allows for coarse-grained<br>
bi-directional linking through message identification in the header<br>
file.  No article can be retracted from Usenet once it has been<br>
submitted; your article has already covered the globe many times over by<br>
the time anyone could have thought to suppress it.  Hypertext could be<br>
implemented simply by tweaking the NNTP protocol to specify not only the<br>
message id, but an exact byte range within the body, and by slightly<br>
altering the "<a href="news:">news:</a>" URL to read individual articles within those byte<br>
ranges.  From then on, instead of quoting an article, you'd add a line<br>
in your post which referenced to "<a href="news:">news:</a>&lt;messageid&gt;/243-257."  It seems<br>
almost too easy.<br>
<p>
Yet there is a problem which I can't resolve.  I'm posting this here to<br>
see if some Extropians can help me to think of an answer.<br>
<p>
One of the most important inabilities in a hypertext system, according<br>
to Drexler, is the inability to retract articles.  This allows for a new<br>
and powerful mode of criticism which was impossible before hypertext.<br>
Did you notice someone contradict something they said long before?  No<br>
problem:  simply reference their original article along with their most<br>
recent post in your criticism.  Now, whenever someone reads the<br>
offending post, they will ALSO see a link to your criticism and the<br>
article stating the opposite.  Permanent back-linking is also important<br>
to historians and other social scientists who are interested in studying<br>
a particular point in time, be it last week or five decades ago.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, as far as I can see, "permanent" and "decentralized"<br>
don't seem to fit together.  In Usenet, there's no guarantee that you'll<br>
find the post which you read last week; say nothing of decades ago. <br>
Nonetheless, the permanent archiving of at least SOME of this<br>
information is useful and important.  How, then, can this issue be<br>
resolved?  Who would pay for a system to archive Usenet forever?<br>
<p>
Drexler and other hypertext proponents suggest a royalty system, where<br>
each time someone reads the text, the reader would pay the author and<br>
archiver.  Unfortunately, implementing a system like this seems<br>
unfeasible and even undesirable, as it is antithetical to the idea that<br>
"information wants to be free."  Royalties try to restrict the<br>
transmission of information and assign legally binding (read: government<br>
enforced) monopolies on content.  Royalties will not and should not<br>
stand up in the face of the Internet, IMHO.<br>
<p>
Individual authors cannot pay for their data forever.  Eventually (if<br>
not immediately) it would become unprofitable to pay for their<br>
unretractable articles.  Besides, what happens when authors go bankrupt<br>
or die?  Advertisers might pay for their data to be distributed, but<br>
eventually they will want to stop paying for their advertisement.  What<br>
happens to their content then?<br>
<p>
How about at least charging one-time micropayments or subscription<br>
charges for information storage and retrieval?  That would allow the<br>
free market to take over.  Information traders could pay a one-time fee<br>
for information and set competitive prices to distribute it.  People<br>
could make a profit on their storage.  Surely a system like that could<br>
last indefinitely, as there is no end of information and no end of<br>
readers.<br>
<p>
But what about the permanent public archive?  Most of USENET would be<br>
profitless to store.  If you're just a guy out in California who noticed<br>
that the president has flip-flopped on health care again, would anyone<br>
pay you to write about that?  For that matter, would archivers even HAVE<br>
a copy of the president's five-year-old health care press conference on<br>
file?  Even if traders charged a great deal to store arcane materials,<br>
there would be very few buyers interested in most of that stored data; a<br>
cost-conscious information trader would wisely pitch the least used<br>
material and keep only the most profitable.<br>
<p>
The hypertext system must somehow remain public and permanent to allow<br>
for this new and obviously desirable form of criticism.  Unfortunately,<br>
no one will pay for such a permanent public archive, except perhaps the<br>
government.  (I barely even want to consider this suggestion.  Like most<br>
Extropians, I don't like government spending.)<br>
<p>
At this point, I'm despairing that a permanent decentralized hypertext<br>
system can work in a free society.  If it's permanent, then it all must<br>
be stored somewhere, and it will never be cost-effective to do so.  If<br>
it's decentralized, the system will drop unprofitable information and<br>
may refuse to buy from most of the public.<br>
<p>
Any ideas?<br>
