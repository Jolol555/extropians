<p>
All it takes for some behavior to seem too weird is for there to be<br>
some population of people who you'd rather not deal with who exhibit<br>
this behavior.  The behavior itself can be most anything.<br>
<p>
Take the example of physics "cranks".  Physics profs regularly receive<br>
unsolicited manuscripts from people without academic credential or<br>
affiliations, which make claims that would be earth-shattering if<br>
true, which don't much attempt to put their work in the context of<br>
current research, and which non-standard notation and tools, and which<br>
seem to have pretty sloppy reasoning.<br>
<p>
Since the vast majority of such manuscripts turn out to be pure junk<br>
on a closer analysis, most physics profs won't bother to read anything<br>
that meets this pattern.  They will even ignore stuff that matches a<br>
small fraction of this pattern.  Yes, they could be rejecting the next<br>
Einstien, but they don't have time to read all this stuff carefully.<br>
<p>
Similarly in politics, most people perceive that there is an army of<br>
ideologues who "know" that adding monetary incentives always makes<br>
anything better, and who are gung ho to, with very little thought or<br>
analysis, reccommend adding them to most any context.  Most people<br>
(rationally) fear the consequences of appointing these ideologues as<br>
politicians, and so rationally avoid a politician who behaved as<br>
they expected these ideologues to behave, as long as they expected few<br>
other types of politicians to also behave this way.<br>
