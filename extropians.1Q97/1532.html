I have to echo that.  Why would you dilute her down that way?  Her being a<br>
venus had nothing to do with her abilities at math!  She just chose not to<br>
pursue that because she probably didn't want to.  Would her being a<br>
mathemetician made her less sexy (to you?)?  Is it your opinion somehow<br>
that being interested in mathematics turns you into something non-sexed, or<br>
drains you of your attractiveness?  Or interferes with your sexuality?<br>
What an odd thing if you do. What does one thing have to do with another?<br>
<p>
And er, just what would have her "female Psyche" have been turned *into*?<br>
A male Psyche?  A non-sexual Psyche?  <br>
<p>
Are you implying that an interest in mathematics leads to a destruction of<br>
sexual identity if you are female?  Where on earth would you get that idea<br>
from?<br>
