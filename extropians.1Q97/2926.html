<p>
An equally irrational belief.  It is doubtful that you can show a<br>
case in which a pure free market economy has actually improved the<br>
human condition for more than few decades before producing a<br>
condition in which the wealth becomes so severely imbalanced that<br>
those who are not already amongst the wealthy elite have little<br>
opportunity for advancement regardless of their ability or<br>
willingness to work.  A situation that does not produce equality of <br>
opportunity, and that does not improve the human condition.<br>
<p>
An op-amp circuit with strong positive feedback will tend not<br>
towards balance, but to lockup in either an extreme positive or<br>
extreme negative state.  Ungoverned free market economies also have<br>
strong positive feedback, and share this same characteristic. <br>
Imagine each individual as an op-amp.  Those who are wealthy <br>
(positive) beyond a certain admittedly fuzzy threshold will tend to <br>
become more wealthy (extraordinary stupidity can change that, but <br>
I'm talking about a tendency, not an outcome that is certain in <br>
every case), while those below that threshold will tend to lose <br>
ground.  The further you are from either side of that threshold, the <br>
less likely it is that you can cross it by your intelligence and <br>
effort alone (or lack thereof, in the case of crossing the threshold <br>
in the negative direction).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; THis is why</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians tend to be highly intelligent, educated, and average</i><br>
<i>&gt; high incomes, as they practice what they preach. THis unfortunately</i><br>
<i>&gt; limits the growth of the party, as the principles of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to disfavor those with deficiencies which inhibit economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; excellence.</i><br>
<p>
Your superiority complex is unimpressive.  I will be happy to discuss<br>
and debate issues with you since you are intelligent enough to have<br>
ideas worth thinking about, and to present an intellectual challenge<br>
for those matters on which we disagree.  But I have no interest in<br>
watching you stroke your ego.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I personally tend to think that children should be raised in equal</i><br>
<i>&gt; social circumstances, to allow as close to an equal level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity as possible, but once they reach whatever is considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; "adulthood", they live by TANSTAAFL.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm...  That is an interesting idea.  I'm not sure whether I can <br>
agree with it or not.  It seems like something that would be a good <br>
thing if it could be made to happen, but might be extremely difficult <br>
to realize.  Perhaps you have thought of some way to bring this <br>
about?  Would this be an area where the traditional a-c opposition to <br>
welfare might be relaxed?<br>
<p>
This gets back to that issue of equality of opportunity vs. equality <br>
of result.  I think we are in at least partial agreement on the <br>
concept, just not on how to achieve it.<br>
<p>
Society does not owe anyone a living, but it does owe everyone an<br>
opportunity to be productive and to be fairly rewarded for that<br>
productivity.  Proposing the idea that society "owes" anyone<br>
anything will probably ruffle some feathers, but consider:  There is <br>
little purpose in constructing a society of any kind if not for the <br>
benefit of the members of that society.  I construct machines to be <br>
my slaves, not to be enslaved by them.  The same should be true of<br>
anything we construct. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As libertarian as I tend to be, I still have had enough personal </i><br>
<i>&gt; experience with people I call "trust fund babies" to consider huge </i><br>
<i>&gt; inheritances as a net evolutionary disadvantage.</i><br>
<p>
Then perhaps we are not as much in disagreement as it might appear<br>
on the surface.  I simply propose that such problems are too often<br>
glossed over, and that avoiding such issues cannot come to any<br>
productive end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;forces than can operate within such an economy that can defeat </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;the built-in self-correcting mechanisms. When you begin with a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;scenario in which wealth is distributed fairly evenly, then a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;free market economy will work very well and will result in high </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;productivity, with clear benefits for those who produce and </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;denial of those benefits for those who do not. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a decent idea so long as you don't propose taking wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; away from people. </i><br>
<p>
My point was only that free markets produce beneficial results when <br>
they start with a reasonably flat distribution of wealth. I do not <br>
propose that it would be beneficial to force them into that <br>
condition.<br>
<p>
However, I cannot say that taking wealth away is unacceptable in<br>
every possible case.  If an economy becomes so imbalanced that one<br>
man owns everything, do the rest of us simply starve to death?   Such <br>
a situation would most likely be corrected by a violent revolution.  <br>
Probably well before it became that extreme.  So when should the <br>
killing start?  20% with 80% of the wealth?  10% with 90%?  1% with <br>
99%?  One guy with everything?<br>
<p>
Economic polarization cannot go indefinately without some kind of <br>
corrective measure.  If not by application of law, then by collapse <br>
into depression or by violence.  But by some means it will end.  Just <br>
like the op-amp with positive feedback, extreme polarization is the <br>
natural tendency of a pure free market economy.  Then it destroys <br>
itself and everything must start all over. An endless oscillation <br>
that starts by building up from nothing, a period of prosperity with <br>
a large middle class, a period of increasing polarization and <br>
increasing unrest, then collapse into depression (or bloody <br>
revolution) and it all begins again.<br>
<p>
This is my model of what would happen with an economy that has zero<br>
governmental regulation.  I am not accusing the rich of being evil. <br>
The victors don't have to be monsters (though there is no reason<br>
they can't be).  It does not require any criminal wrong doing.  No<br>
one has to be forced or deceived into making a spending decision. <br>
Just successful business practices carried to their ultimate<br>
conclusion.  The inevitable outcome of any successful implementation<br>
of the anarcho-capitalistic ideal.  Maybe I'm wrong. I'm sure many<br>
will disagree with my model.  I doubt that there is any historical<br>
precedent that can confirm or disprove since such a system will<br>
likely not complete a single cycle of the oscillation without being<br>
altered in some way during the period of unrest (i.e. government<br>
regulation and/or introduction of some element of socialism) making<br>
it impossible to fully isolate the cause even if it does follow<br>
through to a revolution or a collapse into a depression. Many would<br>
blame the increasing governmental regulation for the collapse.  I<br>
tend more to blame the impending collapse for the increasing<br>
government regulation.  Last resort measures in an attempt to save a<br>
sinking ship.  I'd be happy to hear any alternative models you might<br>
want to offer. And any reasons that you think my model is wrong or<br>
that some other one is more accurate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Making everyone start at zero once they reach</i><br>
<i>&gt; adulthood is what I would call equality of opportunity, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; redistributing the wealth isn't, its penalizing success. </i><br>
<p>
This reminds me of an interesting idea that was proposed as a thought <br>
experiment by a man I used to work with.  Put aside your distaste for <br>
taxation for a moment and contemplate the outcome of this:  A 100% <br>
post-mortem tax, but no other.  It all goes to the state when you <br>
die.  Attempts to cheat the system by giving substantial gifts will <br>
result in having the tax applied early, effectively pressing the <br>
reset button on your life.  You are entitled to keep and enjoy <br>
whatever you rightfully earn (outright theft and fraud would still be <br>
illegal) within your own life, but are entitled to nothing that was <br>
earned by anyone else regardless of relation, except perhaps that the <br>
revenue from the post-mortem tax might be used to provide education <br>
prior to going out on your own, and perhaps a few other public <br>
services that would have to stay entirely within budget.<br>
<p>
I realize that the possibility of extended lifespans screws up this <br>
scenario, but it is interesting to think about none the less.<br>
<p>
