<p>
Last time I checked this stuff out, I became fond of M87. It's the<br>
largest known galaxy in the Virgo Supercluster, it's fairly close<br>
to the center of gravity of the Virgo Supercluster, and it has a<br>
monstrous jet of energy squirting out of it which would be fun to<br>
investigate, and might be quite useful for high-energy physics<br>
experiments, etc. (The Local Group of galaxies hangs out on the<br>
edge of the Virgo Supercluster, for those of you who don't already<br>
know.) One possible problem with M87 is that it is a giant elliptical,<br>
and last time I looked into the astrophysics of galactic evolution,<br>
there seemed to be reasons to believe that elliptical galaxies are not<br>
as rich in the heavy elements (and might even be *carbon-poor*, horror<br>
of horrors) as spiral galaxies. So perhaps M100 instead?<br>
<p>
More recently, though, I've entered a more practical-minded phase,<br>
so I spend a lot more time thinking about carbonaceous chondrites<br>
(and short-period comets) in Earth-approaching orbits. 2100 Ra-Shalom<br>
and so forth. I will be watching the NEAR mission to 433 Eros with<br>
great interest: it will be interesting following a mission that's<br>
being run from Johns Hopkins in Maryland and not from JPL in<br>
Pasadena. The spirit of Clementine lives on! Speaking of Schelling<br>
points, where can I find a list of known near-Earth objects ranked<br>
by roundtrip delta-vee from Earth? I'm having trouble finding<br>
references and my celestial mechanics is still inadequate to make<br>
the task of calculating delta-vees WRT Earth from the raw orbital<br>
elements anything but daunting. But I'm working on it. I should just<br>
give in and get a copy of Dance of the Planets, I know.<br>
