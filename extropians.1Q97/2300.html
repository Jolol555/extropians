<p>
  I read a story once that refers more to pretend action than pretend<br>
belief but still seems relevant here.<br>
<p>
  After an announcement of a new communist strategy in some little<br>
Russian town, and a mention of The-Genius-Of-Times Stalin, all the<br>
audience raised themselves from their seats for a standing ovation.<br>
They started clapping their hands with great force and enthusiasm,<br>
and shouting in admiration of the Leader.  The storm of applause<br>
wouldn't subside as everybody wanted to show himself at least as<br>
enthusiastic as everybody else - and NOBODY wanted to stop first,<br>
or even appear tired - as there were lots of agents watching them,<br>
and the consequences for them would be tragic.  After a VERY long<br>
time everybody felt exhausted, fake, ridiculous and scared to death,<br>
but they couldn't stop.   Whether anybody still believed in what<br>
they were doing, is a moot point - they had to continue demonstrating<br>
it.<br>
<p>
  After a while it ended, with somebody stopping this insanity first<br>
(he was sent to labor camps right after the meeting), and others<br>
sighing with relief and sitting down.<br>
<p>
  After such things are over, each of the participants claims<br>
the same thing - it was the pressure of the environment, they did<br>
what they could to resist, but what could they do alone...<br>
An interesting thing is to watch people when the mandatory behavior<br>
patterns swing back and forth a few times.  Each time they claim<br>
that they always were for the current thing.<br>
<p>
  Also, nobody apologizes for either instilling wrong beliefs, or<br>
following them, and nobody rewards people who fought to turn things<br>
around.  Which makes one wonder whether it's worth one's time trying<br>
to fight for the Right Beliefs.<br>
