John,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I understand, you want to emphasize that the actions that result from free</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have nothing to do with the information received from the senses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the nature of the environment, chemicals in the brain, the structure of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain, the laws of Physics, or anything else. Free action are not caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If that's free then I want to be a slave, randomness sucks.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I never said that free-will had to be entirely divorced from our<br>
sense perceptions, the nature of the environment, our brain state, or any<br>
of these other things we associate with it.  All I'm saying is that these<br>
things must not consistently constrain our choice to that of a single <br>
possible action, or if they do, then it is not free-will by MY definition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I agree that the self-referencing will ultimately be important, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I am not using it at this time because I feel that no ontological</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;basis has yet been defined for the concept of self-referencing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But you just did use self reference, you said "I" 3 times in the brief</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentence above, even " the concept of self-referencing" is self-referencing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In spit of this, or rather because of it, I had no trouble extracting</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning from your words. If "I" has no ontological basis then we might as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well give up on "free will".</i><br>
<p>
Someone else pointed this out too, but you might notice that the "I" always <br>
refers to the one who is making the argument, but not the argument itself.<br>
There is a difference.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;requires us to penetrate into an area of the ontologically unknown</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that we currently perceive as acausal behind which we may find both</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;a truer form of acausality</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think it's a good idea to invoke new science it we don't need to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I don't think we need to. </i><br>
<p>
A further and deeper understanding of the nature of reality always takes new<br>
science.  What you are proposing is nothing but the human race's Nth claim<br>
to have absolute knowledge within current science.<br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;we would then be confusing mathematical semanitics with physical</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;causal principles; a problem that would be analogous to dragging the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;subject of orbital chaos into a discussion of the principles of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;gravitation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What would be wrong with that? It sure doesn't take very long for orbital</i><br>
<i>&gt; chaos to show up, it only takes 3 bodies.</i><br>
<p>
So are you claiming that a discussion of orbital chaos is relevant to a <br>
a discussion of: F = Gm1m2 / r^2 ???<br>
