Aside from the obvious point that a piece of art does not dictate a <br>
movement, I suggest that you read up on the persons who have responded <br>
to your posting thus far.  I believe you'll find that they in part <br>
founded the 'movement' in question (have we come to the point of considering <br>
extropianism a movement?  Hum, a question for another thread).  <br>

You may enjoy rudeness for the shock value, but it won't carry you <br>
very far on this list.  We value creative, skilled, informed and civil <br>
discussion here.  <br>
