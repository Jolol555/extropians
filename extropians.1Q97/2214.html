I just finished reading about the doomslayer Julian Simon in the<br>
February 1997 edition of Wired magazine.  The article is chock full of<br>
non sequiturs.  The illustrations on page138 of Perceptions and<br>
Realities present rather two sets of opposing perceptions.  One labeled<br>
a Perception:  Air Pollution is getting worse is not only a perception<br>
but a reality in areas such as Phoenix Arizona.  Sprawl is paving over<br>
cropland as I have witnessed in the surrounding area of Philadelphia and<br>
especially in Bucks County , were New Yorkers are settling.  Third World<br>
food problems are a reality, take a trip to India.  Forests are<br>
vanishing and being replaced by monoculture tree farms.  Fish are being<br>
fished out, I just think of what happened in Perce, Gaspe Peninsula were<br>
a few years back it was a thriving fishing village.  How does Julian<br>
Simon suddenly qualify as an expert on species extinctions?  What are<br>
his credentials for asserting that only one species is going extinct<br>
each year?      Cyber Edward<br>
