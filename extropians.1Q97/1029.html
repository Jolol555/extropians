The Kalahari bush people have nothing going for them but their wits, lots of <br>
animals are stronger and faster and tougher. If they do something dumb on the <br>
job they don't look foolish to their friends, they don't get demoted and have <br>
to sell their vacation house, they die. These people also have a huge amount<br>
of specialized knowledge and skills, if somebody dropped off you or me in the <br>
middle of The Kalahari desert with nothing but our birthday suite, we'd be <br>
dead in 12 hours, but to the bush people it's as friendly and plentiful a <br>
place as a shopping mall is to us.<br>
             <br>
In our world, if you want to drink beer and watch Gilligan's Island reruns <br>
all day long you can still survive and even reproduce, and in fact many do <br>
just that. Gallileo probably knew more Science 400 years ago than the average <br>
man in the street does now. There was a poll recently of adult Americans, <br>
almost half thought that DNA was a poison, a third though the Universe was <br>
less than 10 thousand years old, and 30% could not find The Pacific Ocean on <br>
a globe. But then, you can't expect them to know every tinny little <br>
topographical feature of the planet.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Certainly the individuals who are surviving best in the world                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;of rapid technology advancements are those who are show                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;immense adaptive intelligence. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It is not true that intelligent people have more children than stupid people, <br>
not in our world anyway, but I'll bet it's true in the world of The Kalahari  <br>
bush people.       <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Vast improvements in intelligence will be THE defining                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;feature in the progress of the human species.</i><br>
                   <br>

Well yes, but what does that have to do with the price of eggs?<br>
