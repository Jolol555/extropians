<i>&gt; No one has shown me any evidence that a computer has the ability to feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotive sensation, and I do not believe our discussion is progressing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; that direction. Thus at this point, at least for the time being, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose that we agree to disagree.</i><br>
<p>
I still hold some small hope for you to understand, so I'll try one<br>
more tack: from where you're sitting now, look up to the corner of<br>
the room you're in.  See it?  /Where/ do you see it?  Sure, it appears<br>
to be in the corner of the room, a few feet away.  But you don't have<br>
any tentacles out there; your eyes are next to your head.  But your<br>
eyes aren't really seeing it either; they're just photosensors.  The<br>
act of /seeing/ is occurring in the processes of your brain, where<br>
you are processing data from the retina, concluding that those data<br>
represent a corner 10 feet away, and then causing you to /experience/<br>
a corner that /appears/ 10 feet away.<br>
<p>
Now, pinch your hand.  Feel that?  /Where/ did you feel it?  You<br>
didn't feel it with your hand, because if you could, it wouldn't have<br>
any need for the nerves that carry the impulse up to the brain to do<br>
the feeling.  And the brain doesn't send anything back down to the<br>
hand.  The /feeling/ happens right up there in your brain, and the<br>
processing arranges things so that you /believe/ you are feeling it<br>
in your hand, and it even back-patches the timestamps in memory so you<br>
think you felt it when the stimulus actually happened.  The brain is<br>
very good at that, as evidenced by things like phi experiments and<br>
sound compression (that takes advantage of the fact that sounds can<br>
mask other sounds that occur forward in time).<br>
<p>
So, tell me again where those emotional experiences occur?  Sure, I<br>
may experience fear viscerally, but there aren't even any nerves in<br>
my viscera, so those experiences are taking place /in the brain/, as<br>
patterns of chemical transmission and potentiation.  It then produces<br>
some outputs like heart rate, sweaty palms, etc., which I also become<br>
aware of /in the brain/.<br>
<p>
Now then, what is the difference between "fear" manifested as patterns<br>
of chemical transmission and potentiation in the brain, and those same<br>
patterns manifested as electrical transmissions and magnetic storage<br>
in a computer of similar speed and capacity?  When computers become<br>
sufficiently powerful to learn the way children do, and control their<br>
own sensory inputs and mechanical outputs, in what way would reactions<br>
of its software be qualitatively different from those of our wetware?<br>
<p>
Why do you continue to label him an inferior being?  Either you are<br>
postulating dualism (and say so if that's your case), or else you<br>
are simply a "carbonist" for reasons you will not justify.<br>
