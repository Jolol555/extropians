It's also worth remembering that before the last election the media polls<br>
were predicting a Labour win by several percentage points (with only one<br>
percent error in the polls), yet oddly enough that didn't happen. Being a<br>
recovering socialist nation people don't like to admit that they are<br>
selfish folks who might vote for the Conservative party so they tend to<br>
lie to pollsters. This left many prominent market research organisations<br>
with several tons of egg on their face. <br>
<p>
So all in all I won't be surprised if Labour win, but I wouldn't bet on it<br>
either. In fact the Deputy Prime Minister was today claiming that he<br>
expected to win the election by sixty seats. If the polls really are false<br>
and that makes more Conservative voters turn out then he may well be<br>
right. <br>
