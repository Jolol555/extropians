<p>
Perhaps you are thinking of only one motivation for uploading. I<br>
suspect that people who ardently want to upload might have several<br>
different motivations, and that some of these people might have<br>
more than one such motivation at once.<br>
<p>
There are, I'm sure, some people who want to upload precisely<br>
*because* they want to explore outerspace themselves in person,<br>
and because they are well aware that changing over to an entirely<br>
new platform would be a big advantage in such a project. I don't<br>
see that this kind of upload counts as "less transhuman" than some<br>
other kind. I also don't see that the notion of "profit" needs much<br>
adjustment to survive the transition from human to posthuman. Profit<br>
is surplus value in an exchange (preferably accruing to both sides,<br>
because my taste inclines toward positive-sum games) or in a<br>
production activity, and value is a function of what the entities<br>
in question want.<br>
<p>
So what sort of motivations did you have in mind for uploading? I'm<br>
honestly curious.<br>
