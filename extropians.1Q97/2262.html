<p>
Please let us in on which measure of complexity you are using, and<br>
which instruments you used to carry out the measurement.<br>
<p>
(I don't know about you, but I've known some pretty bad people in<br>
my life--just a few--and I don't know what I would do if I was<br>
offered a choice between saving just one of *these* people and<br>
saving a few hundred acres of pristine Amazonian rain forest. If<br>
I was acting *selfishly*, I would certainly go for the rain forest,<br>
because I would enjoy that far more than I would enjoy one of these<br>
people that I'm thinking of (and I rarely think of them).  Perhaps<br>
you are luckier than I am and have never met any bad people in your<br>
life.)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Besides, ecologies aren't conscious,</i><br>
<p>
How do you know?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;and whatever the</i><br>
<i> &gt;Meaning of Life is, I strongly suspect that it requires consciousness</i><br>
<i> &gt;(or some similar ontologically engineered substance) as substrate.</i><br>
<p>
Why? Aren't you being a little sophontocentric about the Meaning of Life?<br>
<p>
Today I'm feeling more in agreement with Hal's contrarian post of<br>
yesterday on environmental policy. The ethical concerns that motivate<br>
environmentalism are so abstract, luxuriant, and upper-class that<br>
I fear the aristocracies of the various nations on the planet are<br>
going to use these concerns to squish the economic development of<br>
the lower classes, particularly in the Third World. And I've always<br>
thought the sight of comfortably upper-middle-class American and<br>
European professors blathering about population control and population<br>
explosions was just a pleasant display of sublimated racism. "We<br>
got ours, now all you darkies just be good and get fixed and stay<br>
at home, okay? And don't try to immigrate here either." Truly a<br>
disgusting spectacle.<br>
<p>
Anyone truly dedicated to the environmentalist cause should be<br>
worrying about potential impacts from Near-Earth Objects and trying<br>
to fix that first. A high-velocity comet could come swooping out<br>
of the Oort Cloud any year, and we are sitting ducks along with<br>
all the other species on this planet. But we're the only species<br>
that can do anything about it, and what are we doing instead? I<br>
have no idea. Engaging in mindless tax-and-waste games on a global<br>
basis, I guess.<br>
<p>
I am in general inclined to agree with Hal that I am willing to<br>
trade off some current diversity of life-forms in order to insure<br>
even greater future diversity of life-forms, and the insurance I<br>
crave is the Diaspora of Life and Mind beyond this planet. In the<br>
long term, what I want is more different kinds of people. As long<br>
as there's enough action going on, and enough different kinds of<br>
action, I'll probably find a satisfying niche somewhere. But if<br>
the future is a monocrop, I doubt very much that it will be a<br>
monocrop of anything I could get along with in friendly fashion.<br>
