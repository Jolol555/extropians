<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now they use</i><br>
<i>&gt;specially made containers that are not recyclable at all due to their</i><br>
<i>&gt;composite structure of paper, waxes, and plastic, but are using up many</i><br>
<i>&gt;old growth trees in the process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Just so you know, old growth trees are not used for making cheapy crap like<br>
food wrappers/containers. They are used for furniture and decrative fences<br>
etc. etc.<br>
no bussiness man would want to use old growth for such easy throw away<br>
items as food containers cause its much cheaper and easier to get the<br>
farmed, fast growing pine and excess wood shavings produced from the wood<br>
mills.<br>
It ain't economical to do that guys.<br>
and that's always the bottom line, ain't it?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;These are just a few, and, should people start shouting about ad</i><br>
<i>&gt;homenim, blah blah blah, I could do more research and come up with more,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as they do exist, of the completely insane things environmentalists do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
there are insane ones on both sides of the the fence, I'm sure one chould<br>
pull up half a dozen wacky stunts pulled by people for what they believe<br>
are good reasons,in the environmentalist camp.<br>
but I don't think that should be the focus. media has a way of making any<br>
group look like a bunch of idiots. case in point, the L.A. weekly<br>
interviewed three cryonists, one of them being me. the interviewer was<br>
great. I really thought were going to get a fair shake. but it turned out<br>
not to be the case. thankfully, I was cut from the article. but  the end<br>
result was a horrible review that painted all cryonists as geeks that can't<br>
get a date. it wasn't pretty. made the front page.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have found that many if not most environmentalist groups are in</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence simply to raise funds by appearing to advocate rules and</i><br>
<i>&gt;regulations that have an initial apparent purpose of making somebody</i><br>
<i>&gt;else clean something up.</i><br>
<p>
they actually try to give teeth to the existing laws on the books.<br>
and have had success in doing so, to some extent.<br>
as for making some one else clean it up. what do you mean by that?<br>
you think they should go out and clean up other peoples messes for them,<br>
when it should be the ones who did it, do it?<br>
<p>
 They also typically wind up causing even more<br>
<i>&gt;environmental damage across the board than they prevented</i><br>
<p>
this I don't think is so.<br>
<p>
<p>
 (just look at<br>
<i>&gt;the anti-nuke movement, which was incidentally funded by fossil fuel</i><br>
<i>&gt;companies).</i><br>
<i>&gt;--</i><br>
it maybe have been funded by them, but I think your calling something black<br>
and white when there is a hell of a lot of grey area here.<br>
there has to be a balance in these views. I don't think the<br>
enviromentalists are all correct and I don't think radical viewpoints of<br>
extropians are correct either.<br>
one thing you have convinced me of is that I've gotta read that article in<br>
wired.<br>
<p>
by the way, for those of you who don't know me, I am a cryonist and an<br>
extropian believe it or not..<br>
