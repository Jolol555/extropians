<i>&gt; Now David Musick asks:  Is there any reason to be optimistic that </i><br>
<i>&gt; Reason will finally prevail?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; David answers in the affirmative.  I disagree.  I don't think reason will </i><br>
<i>&gt; finally prevail.  I think what will happen is, the word "Reason" will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; increasingly invoked as a code-word, but reason itself will not prevail </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the internet any more than anywhere else.  On the contrary:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; the very people who go on and on about "Reason" will be the first to </i><br>
<i>&gt; *quell* inquiries into matters that they don't want to see discussed.  </i><br>
<p>
What is your evidence for this assertion?  In my brief participation<br>
with this list, I have been quite vocal about reason, but I also have<br>
practiced it.  I have not "quelled" any inquiry, in fact I'm the only<br>
one who called de Garis's observation a valuable one and suggested<br>
study of it.  I've also stood up for free inquiry against restraint.<br>
<p>
The one exchange I see where I might have appeared dogmatic is the<br>
"Alternative Medicine" thread.  But even there, I was quite clear that<br>
I was not suggesting dismissal of any particular line of inquiry, but<br>
I was arguing that certain practitioners should be morally judged as<br>
charlatans precisely because the /do/ dismiss lines of inquiry that<br>
have proven effective.  I have nothing but respect for a doctor who<br>
tells a cancer patient "Chemotherapy has a reasonable chance of saving<br>
your life, and we know it pretty well.  It will also make you weak,<br>
nauseous, bald, and miserable.  There are some untested therapies that<br>
you might want to use as well, and there's experimental drugs you may<br>
want to join a study for.  Here's what I know..."  On the other side,<br>
there is the practitioner who says "Chemotherapy will make you sick.<br>
Doctors just pump you with drugs because drug companies can make more<br>
profit that way.  Hundreds of people swear by my herbal therapy, and<br>
many have gone into complete remission."  This latter man is morally<br>
culpable for the deaths he hastens by denying proven treatment.  I<br>
remain open to criticism of my moral judgments, but I don't see why I<br>
should withhold them.<br>
<p>
It is a common criticism of reason by its enemies that it is just<br>
another dogma.  But they're wrong.  They are identifying one feature<br>
that the two share, i.e. "strongly held belief", and thereby equating<br>
them, which conveniently ignores the other feature of dogma that is<br>
just as critical to its definition: closed to criticism.  This latter<br>
is the distinguishing feature of dogma, not the former.  And so long<br>
as strong, vocal, unfailing advocates of reason understand that one<br>
difference, it will always win.<br>
