<i>&gt; From: Lee Daniel Crocker </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; But is it really so bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to have social consience built into the society?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; MAX M Rasmussen</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it is.  "Social Conscience" assigns rights to an entity called</i><br>
<i>&gt; "society" which deserves no rights.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and takes them away from enities</i><br>
<i>&gt; that do deserve them: individuals.  At the same time, it destroys</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual responsiblity.</i><br>
<p>
Not neceseraly. Social democracy is not the same as socialism. It's more<br>
like what you had in the US with the "new deal."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An eight-year-old can understand the difference between a set and its</i><br>
<i>&gt; members; you cannot perform operations on one that you can on the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A set of people is not a person.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah let's get personal and insulting, that will probably help discussion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A person has will, and can act for</i><br>
<i>&gt; his own benefit.  When you create "society", and assign it rights, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have given rights to an entity with no means or will to exercise them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and no way to benefit from them.</i><br>
<p>
"no means or will"? A society is an organisation. An organisation can<br>
easily have a free will. Or perhaps you mean that an individual is aways<br>
more powerfull than organisations? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Therefore, it must take from certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals and give to others, and cannot be held accountable for</i><br>
<i>&gt; either.  Even its laudable goals such as helping the unfortunate wind</i><br>
<i>&gt; up in the hands of faceless bureacracies blindly following rules, taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; by force and doling out by formula.  Compassion at gunpoint is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; human compassion.</i><br>
<p>
How have you been compassionate recently as an individual? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Social Conscience" is an evil, not because its goals are evil, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it does not--it cannot possibly--achieve those goals as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; as individual rights and responsibility can.</i><br>
<p>
I have been to the US and would feel ashamed as a an individual if we<br>
treated poor and sick people like that here in Denmark.<br>
<p>
The faster technolgy progresses the less the libertarian ideas will work<br>
for the common man. It will turn the world into a place where a technoelite<br>
owns the mean of production. When technology makes it possible for the most<br>
talented people to do allmost everything what will then happen to the not<br>
so talented?<br>
<p>
Society didn't become truly rich until the common man became wealthy. Even<br>
Henry Ford saw that.<br>
<p>
Paradox: If individuals have rights and shows social responsibility, how<br>
can individuals then believe in a system that only bennefits the most<br>
talented people. (survival of the fittest).<br>
<p>
BTW i don't consider myself to be a social democrat but a social<br>
liberalist. And certainly there should be as little goverment as possible.<br>
