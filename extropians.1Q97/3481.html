I don't think that's the way to go, it's only a paradox if things are finite. <br>
If the universe is infinite then God's mind could, as required, have an  <br>
infinite number of parts, so He could know exactly what was going to happen  <br>
in the Universe and He could also know exactly what He Himself was going to  <br>
do now and a billion years from now. In other words, although we have free <br>
will God would not.<br>
<p>
Suppose God was made up of an infinite number of the old Z80 computer chips  <br>
and, of course, a operating system so they could work together. You could <br>
assign 10 chips to analyze and predict what one chip could do, if that didn't <br>
do the job make it a thousand chips or a million, if that still wasn't enough <br>
assign an infinite number of chips, remember the definition of an infinite<br>
set is that you can make a one to one correspondence with a proper subset of <br>
it. Strange things happen in the arithmetic of infinities, each chip without <br>
exception could have an infinite number of chips packing an infinite amount <br>
of computing power making predictions about what that one finite chip would <br>
do, and you would still have an infinite number of chips to do other things, <br>
like figuring out what would happen next in the universe.<br>
<p>
I think a better strategy is to ask the theists if God is omnipotent, if they  <br>
say yes ask them if he can make a rock so heavy he can't lift it. Then ask <br>
them if good and evil are independent of God. If they say yes then God has <br>
nothing to with morality, except He is supposed to act that way, just like<br>
everybody else. If they say no then the statement "God is good" is a vacuous <br>
tautology.                                       <br>
