I'm not sure how many high tech venture capitalists there were in North<br>
America in 1830-50. Even if there were, Babbage was probably taking his<br>
best shot with the British Government. Having raised $12M in venture<br>
funding for a startup years ago I can tell you its a long, drawn-out<br>
arduous process even in the age of the fax machine and jet airplanes. It<br>
grinds you down, especially if what you really want to do is design high<br>
tech stuff, not explain to people with lot's of money why you can do what<br>
no one else has thought of or has tried and failed. Its even worse if you<br>
have no "credentials." (Been there, done that - its a real pain)<br>
<p>
"steal his stake for him" - ??<br>
<p>
"real entrepreneurs" - British companies started colonies all over the<br>
world and set up trading posts like Hong Kong in the hopes of "making their<br>
fortunes". They also set up botanical gardens which were biological<br>
laboratories for finding new plant-based products like tea and rubber. Read<br>
Neal Stephenson's fascinating article about the transatlantic cable in<br>
Wired a few months back. It sure sounds like Lord Kelvin had<br>
entrepreneurial spirit to me. But I digress...<br>
<p>
Babbage was pouring what funds he had into experiments and the prototype as<br>
well as financing the search for funding and putting food in his own mouth.<br>
I suspect he felt he couldn't afford the time or the money to chase<br>
investors in America who were probably (in his mind) less sophisticated<br>
technically and therefore less likely to finance a venture in England where<br>
they couldn't easily keep watch over their investment. And besides, US<br>
nationalistic pride might discourage investment in the former ruling<br>
country that had burned down the White House in 1812. That is, if in fact<br>
he didn't look for US funds. Does anyone know if he ever tried to find US<br>
investors?<br>
<p>
BTW, I thought that Scientific American was a well written and respected<br>
popular science magazine. Why do you characterize it as "socialist" or<br>
"propaganda" or a "rag "? What have I been missing all these years?<br>
