<i>&gt;Why would you want a silicon, or silicon-compound, skin anyway?  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;have that kind of tech, and want semiconductors in your skin, use</i><br>
<i>&gt;diamond circuitry.  Much more useful would be diamondoid plates.  Or</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps buckyhair.  How does buckyfiber rate on the Kevlar scale?  For</i><br>
<i>&gt;more decoration, artificial quartzes, corundum, or diamond, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;impurities in some particular pattern.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that buckyfibre is terribly practical as a clothing material.<br>
Simply put, the applications for buckytubes are for storing other things,<br>
such as fuel or whatnot. Since most fibres are polymers, (like Kevlar), it<br>
would be very possible to make a super Kevlar, a lighter stronger Kevlar,<br>
through nanotechnology. By arranging the atoms manually, all the problems<br>
associated with Kevlar can be eliminated. In fact, I think a good design<br>
would be strands of super Kevlar joining nanoscale diamond crystals. Since<br>
they're all carbon based (diamonds being pure carbon) it may be possible to<br>
chemically bond them. I'm not sure though, I'm not an organic chemist.<br>
