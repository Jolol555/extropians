<i>&gt; nearly everything a person x does or doesn't do, will have an effect on</i><br>
<i>&gt; some person y... What do you suggest for solving problems ? I'm open for</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternatives, it's just that i know none, if there are, i am sorry for my</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorance.</i><br>
<p>
This is the old "breathing is a trespass" argument against anarchism,<br>
and it holds some merit.  The reason it fails is just plain economics:<br>
redressing such microscopic grievances costs more than tolerating them.<br>
A monopoly government typically imposes its own standards of trespass.<br>
Punching a man in the nose will likely get you arrested for assault;<br>
tapping him on the shoulder to ask the time probably won't, but these<br>
actions are clearly matters of degree, not kind.<br>
<p>
When the redress of grievances is placed in the free market, solutions<br>
will be arrived at that are the most efficient for the circumstances<br>
without the nedd for external control.  Each protection agency (assuming<br>
for the moment a Friedman-like system) will set its own "deductables"<br>
of harm, and they will tend to settle into those values that cause it<br>
to attract enough business without costing too much in effort.  It is<br>
likely that the agencies will all find similar levels that best suit<br>
human nature and the technology of the day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In extreme cases yes. What is the Anarcho Capitalist view on patents for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example ? I can imagine situations where ones 'ownership' of technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes, genetic codes etc, limits free trade and the freedom of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual, can't you ? </i><br>
<p>
This is actually an area of contention: Freidman believes in intellectual<br>
property law pretty much as it exists today, with copyrights and patents<br>
(for a more detailed view, his essay "Standards as Intellectual Property"<br>
is on his web site at <a href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/">http://www.best.com/~ddfr/</a>).  I and others do not.<br>
I personally believe that scarcity is a fundamental irreducible attribute<br>
of property, and therefore things like contractual privileges and names<br>
(i.e., trademarks) are property, but pure copyrights and patents are not.<br>
Nor do I accept the popular justification that they are necessary to<br>
encourage creation and invention--they do no such thing, they just<br>
manipulate the market into preferring forms of invention that we have<br>
become accustomed to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I may become a mild libertarian, after some time spent on this list, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; its ideas do interest me a lot, but never, that is NEVER, will i let</i><br>
<i>&gt; political ideals form an obstacle for Transhumanist cooperation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication. Something with which not everybody on this list seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree. </i><br>
<p>
In human beings, the capability to be more than hunter-gatherers lies<br>
in our ability to communicate and cooperate toward goals.  Precisely<br>
because of this, our future is necessarily shaped by political ideals<br>
more than by any other factor: politics is the normative philosophy of<br>
human interaction.  My future will be shaped not only by my own actions,<br>
but by those with whom I exchange ideas, engage in trade, and those who<br>
stand in my way.  Current political systems stand in my way, and those<br>
who act as apologists for the state earn my contempt and enmity, and it<br>
is worth my effort to change their minds.<br>
