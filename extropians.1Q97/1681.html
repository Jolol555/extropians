Extropians!  I have lurked on the Extropian list and then took a hiatus<br>
and am back lurking again.  I am just coming off a SAVE THE WORLD<br>
mailing list devoted to the works of Daniel Quinn who wrote ISHMAEL,<br>
STORY OF B etc.  Daniel Quinn has a theory that the human race went<br>
wrong about 10,000 years ago when it turned to totalitarian agriculture.<br>
 Totalitarian agriculture eliminates all biological competitors in the<br>
production of human food.  Now Quinn views the Salvationist religions<br>
which developed out of this agricultural revolution as being a major<br>
part of the ecological crisis.  He sees humanity overpopulating the<br>
earth and destroying the biological community of which it is a part and<br>
cannot exist without.  He talks about the Great Forgetting of 3 million<br>
years of human existence living in tribes on this planet.  Daniel Quinn<br>
wants humanity to have a new mythology to enact which would allow the<br>
biological community to continue to evolve and exist.  It is not clear<br>
to me if the Extropians have this perception of an ecological crisis or<br>
the view that man must exist within a biological community.  In<br>
INFO-PSYCHOLOGY Dr. Timothy Leary wrote that "Ecology is the seductive<br>
dinosaur science that will lead most of the post-human species to<br>
conform to terrestrial conditions, become reasonably comfortable,<br>
passive, robot-conditioned cyborg innsectoids directed by centralized<br>
broadcasting systems. "  He goes on talking about adapting to a cyborg<br>
existence.  Elsewhere, Tim Leary wrote that planet Earth is not suitable<br>
for an ever expanding technological civilization and Industry must<br>
migrate to the asteroids and other planets citing G. Harry Stine's book<br>
THE THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.  Daniel Quinn views this outmigration<br>
of humans as sorcery, thinking that humans cannot exist outside of the<br>
biological community.  The current Industrial Society is rapidly<br>
changing the face of the Earth.  I just got a report from a friend in<br>
Germany on how the Autobahn is adding additional lanes and in his words<br>
"das ganze Land wird zur Strasse"  the whole countryside is being paved<br>
over with highways.  Hearing the refrain from Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow<br>
Taxi song " They paved paradise and put up a parking lot,  you don't<br>
know what you got till it's gone, took all the trees and put them in a<br>
tree musuem, and charged all the people a dollar and a half just to see<br>
them".  That song seems more and more relevant.  Putting all my Internet<br>
exposure and voracious reading together gives me an information overload<br>
that is hard to deal with.  The Extropians seem to me to be like the<br>
futuristic intellectual province envisioned in Hermann Hesse's GLASS<br>
BEAD GAME of the 24th century.     Lurker   Ed Maciocha<br>
