In a message dated 97-03-10 15:01:05 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  <br>
 I submit a fair reading of the evidence from the horses own mouth suggest <br>
 that Gallo was arguing that HTLV-I causes AIDS in 1983.  Others concur. <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; </i><br>
 <br>
Your (and the others) lack of training in review of scientific papers is<br>
showing very conspicuously.  You probably have not had the opportunity to<br>
review papers before.  I suspect you have not published in a peer reviewed<br>
publication nor defended a research dissertation.  Not all MS or PhD's have<br>
even done this, however many PhD's have done at least _some_ research (if not<br>
most PhDs).<br>
<p>
That really does not matter except you could have gotten training by<br>
participating in those activities.   If you wish, I would like to help you.<br>
 Keep reading.  You are very motivated in this subject and I find that<br>
refreshing. <br>
 <br>
----------------------------------------------------- <br>
Scientific papers are divided into the sections following: <br>
I.  Purpose <br>
II.  Introduction/Background  <br>
III.  Methods and Materials <br>
IV.  Data/Results Section <br>
and <br>
V. The Results and/or Discussion (Where the data is discussed and where<br>
future research direction is speculated on based on the data and the<br>
experience of the authors.)  Most of your quotes are from this section (and<br>
rightly so, on your part). <br>
------------------------------------------------------ <br>
(I will use you post as an example because you seem very intrigued with this<br>
subject.) <br>
 <br>
The (Gallo et al's) discussion section speculates on future research<br>
possibilities based on his data and research experience.  That is what the<br>
discussion section of a scientific paper is for.    The introduction section<br>
is  <br>
 <br>
1.  Gallo et al. says "IF" HTLV plays a role at all and NOT that HTLV<br>
actually _does_ play a role. <br>
 <br>
Do you see difference?  You read "IF" as "DOES."  . .  .  "Our results, [ if<br>
<i> ] they do reflect an etiologic role for HTLV in AIDS, suggest a possible</i><br>
mechanism of disease induction." <br>
 <br>
2.  He says HTLV-like virus and does NOT say HTLV-I (or HTLV-II, HTLV-III or<br>
HTLV-V).  Do you see the difference between a class of viruses and a specific<br>
virus?  This is normal in microbiology.  So, you should be careful what you<br>
"read-into" the discussion section.  Scientists usually should use hedge<br>
words to minimize any misinterpretation by the scientific community. <br>
 <br>
You read "HTLV" as "HTLV-I". .  .  So, you misread the virus class as a<br>
specific virus.  "Our results, if they do reflect an etiologic role for [<br>
HTLV  ] in AIDS, suggest <br>
a possible mechanism of disease induction."   <br>
 <br>
Also notice they (Gallo et al) was the words "suggest" and "possible."  Again<br>
they are not sure and are making very sure trained scientists know they are<br>
not sure.  There will be no doubts, with trained scientists, that Gallo et al<br>
are not suggesting that they have discovered a virus or a mechanism causing<br>
AIDS.  <br>
 <br>
This is significant because in the popular press (and layman's language)<br>
"suggest" and "possible" are considered as powerful hedge words (or<br>
speculation words) as in a scientific paper.  This is where you will have to<br>
"put on your scientist cap" and learn how to read the scientific papers<br>
differently than a layman's news report.   This is an important area.  You<br>
will see this again and again and may not be sure how to interpret the<br>
author's scientific dialect. <br>
 <br>
3.  There is also nothing in the (Gallo et al) purpose about proving HTLV-I<br>
causes AIDS;  Only that they (Gallo et al) wanted to test if a retrovirus of<br>
some kind involved in the AIDS.  And they know that is all their research<br>
suggests:  "We have been testing the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by a<br>
human retrovirus.."   <br>
 <br>
This does NOT say that they did anything more than try to find a retroviral<br>
cause of AIDS.  It was a very proper thing to do since at the time (the early<br>
1980's) nobody knew what was going on with the cause of AIDS. <br>
 <br>
4.  "that the viral genome of HTLV was found to be integrated into peripheral<br>
<p>
blood lymphocyte DNA in 2 of 33 AIDS patients tested thus far may <br>
reflect an etiologic association..."   <br>
 <br>
This set off bells in scientists in France (and around the world) where they<br>
were looking at different research directions to go to in.  Secretly, they<br>
already had started the peer review with their own paper (also published in<br>
_Science_ ) and they were probably very happy when Gallo et al vindicated<br>
their own speculations about a viral cause of AIDS independently.    <br>
 <br>
Because 33 AIDS patients were positive for retrovirus (HTLV-like) this was<br>
very strong  evidence an HTLV class virus is involved.  However, since the<br>
HTLV retroviruses are so close in genone it was hard for them (Gallo's group)<br>
to tell them apart; or if the HTLV class viruses were incidental or an actual<br>
cause, hence the hedge words used in the discussion section of the paper.   <br>
 <br>
Again HTLV-I is NOT the only virus suspected by the authors.  In fact,<br>
because they were so unsure (and careful not to be called wrong by peer<br>
review) they did NOT single out HTLV-I as the only possible cause.   They<br>
invited further research by others to find a new virus, possibly related to<br>
the HTLV class of viruses.  And, they _were_ careful, they were apparently<br>
RIGHT!  (at least for one of the causes of AIDS)  But Gallo's group was NOT<br>
sure at the time this article was published and they did not get credit for<br>
the viral discovery of AIDS at the time.  The Pasteur Institute beat him to<br>
it.  Yet, Gallo got the credit after all, partly because they were lead in<br>
the right direction by the Pasteur Institute's virology group paper and<br>
getting viral samples from France group. <br>
 <br>
5.  "Since HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, the apparent lack of epidemic <br>
AIDS in this region may argue against a causative role for HTLV in AIDS. <br>
However...people in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to <br>
the T-cell suppressive effect of the virus." <br>
 <br>
So, they argue _against_ even the whole class of HTLV viruses as the cause of<br>
AIDS.  That does not support your premise that they were arguing only for the<br>
HTLV class of what we now know as several viruses with similar genome.   <br>
 <br>
Notice how each Gallo et al statement agrees with what I said in my previous<br>
posts.  Gallo gives a fair speculation and assessment of HTLV and a possible<br>
reason for HTLV not being the cause.  He should and does speculate on a<br>
reason for the endemic virus resistance.   <br>
 <br>
6.  "Since HTLV is a T-cell tropic virus it can be linked hypothetically to<br>
other <br>
human T-cell disorders."    <br>
 <br>
Gallo said "can be" not _is_ and not as a cause but as a speculation.  Also<br>
Gallo does not even say HTLV-I, but uses the correct HTLV class name for what<br>
became HTLV-III and is (currently at least) called HIV.   <br>
 <br>
7.  "Since HTLV can also infect marmoset and other primate T-cells, should <br>
this virus be established as the causative agent of AIDS, it may also be <br>
possible to develop an animal model of the disease." <br>
 <br>
Very good and proper future research direction. <br>
 <br>
8.  "Should this virus be established"  is another speculation and not a<br>
direct argument for the virus being established; only a future research<br>
direction.  That is what good scientists do when they are not yet sure or has<br>
not felt that they have proved their point. <br>

I hope this helps you become more familiar with scientific paper<br>
interpretation.  <br>

----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Some errors here:<br>
 <br>
1.  "In 1982, Robert Gallo from the National Cancer Institute in the USA, put<br>
forward the hypothesis that the cause of AIDS is a retrovirus."<br>
<p>
No, it was 1983.  You found that error yourself probably already by the<br>
Science paper you posted.<br>
<p>
2.  One year later, Myron Essex and his colleagues found that AIDS patients<br>
had<br>
antibodies to the Human T-cell Leukemia virus Type-1 (HTLV-I), a virus<br>
discovered by Gallo a few years earlier. <br>
<p>
Misleading.  HTLV-I was found in 1976 by Asher, Gibbs and Gajdusek. <br>
<p>
3.  At the same time, Gallo and his colleagues reported the isolation of<br>
HTLV-I from AIDS patients <br>
<p>
Misleading over simplification.  Just the retrovirus HTLV-like genome class<br>
of "gag" type vriuses were reported.  He never specified HTLV-I.<br>
<p>
4.  and advocated a role for this retrovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."<br>
<p>
As you saw he did not "advocate." He stated possibly future research<br>
directions.  (The popular press has invaded everywhere I guess).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;[Papadopulos-Eleopulos, E., V.F. Turner, J.M. Papadimitriou, Has Gallo</i><br>
proven the role of HIV in AIDS? Emergency Medicine 1993; 5:5-147.]<br>
<p>
I don't think this was a peer reviewed publication.  In any event,  the<br>
editor should have corrected the misleading statements.<br>
<p>
Hinde sight is 20:20, so now many people are giving credit to Gallo, but I<br>
don't.  The Pasteur Institute did far more than Gallo IMO.  Yet, they don't<br>
even get "honerable mention" sometimes.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I liked  Dr. Duesberg skeptisism.  Duesberg had on the surface, some<br>
interesting oints but what tiped me off was his unwillinness to look any new<br>
data from 1990 forward and at the clinical significance of the CD4+ levels.<br>
 He also included non-AIDS defined patients in his "proof."  This was not<br>
science, nor speculation and seemed unfair to me.  This is when I stopped<br>
trusting him.  It was a great disappointment for me because I was at the<br>
University of Wisconsin when Temin was  there and (I attended) lecturing on<br>
roux sarcoma (the first retrovirus ever discovered) and (I don't know it you<br>
know this but)  Dr. Duesberg wrote a really nice paper on "my pet roux<br>
sarcoma virus."   I used to respect him.  I hope I will again someday.<br>
