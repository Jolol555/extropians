<i>        &gt;&gt;to the receiver. It's only when the receiver compared his results         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;speed of light or less, would it become obvious that what I did        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;instantly changed what happened in the distant receiver. </i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Michael:  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;But what if you start out by transmitting some sort of "Rosetta         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Stone" type code set ahead of time via STL radio, such that as the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;wave front of the signal passes  radio capable worlds who receive </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the signal, they have some sort of decryption apparatus that can </i><br>
<i>        &gt;then decipher the "random" FTL signal as it is transmitted from its </i><br>
<i>        &gt;source?</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
The trouble is that the Rosetta Stone would have to be as big as the message <br>
you want to send, and much worse, there is no general Rosetta Stone. Before  <br>
I can write the decryption instructions I must know what the message I want <br>
to send is.  Thus, I can instantly send a "message" to somebody a billion <br>
light years away, but until he gets the unscrambling instructions he can't  <br>
even tell a message was sent much less know what it said, it would all look  <br>
like the same old random noise to him. The unscrambling instructions can only  <br>
be sent at lightspeed so it will be a billion years before he knows about the <br>
information I sent. It would be just as fast and much easier to forget about  <br>
the Quantum effects and just sent the information by radio.<br>
