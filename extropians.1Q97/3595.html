<i>&gt; &lt;3. "REBT is based on the assumption that what we label our </i><br>
<i>&gt; "emotional" reactions are largely caused by our conscious and </i><br>
<i>&gt; unconscious evaluations, interpretations, and philosophies."&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;Is this definition in keeping with the new neurobiological </i><br>
<i>&gt; discoveries of hard-wired emotional systems (recently discussed on </i><br>
<i>&gt; this list)?  I'm all for learning to control these systems more </i><br>
<i>&gt; effectively, but I sense an underlying assumption here that they don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; even exist.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
That's a very important "largely" in that first description.<br>
Although a responsible scientist prefers more specific numbers to<br>
weasel words like that, I think one probably could quantify this<br>
better by anayzing how twins raised apart respond to questions<br>
about their emotional reactions.  My own guess, absent any such<br>
data, is that the "largely" is over 80%, though you are correct<br>
that 100%--the "tabula rasa" idea--is clearly false based on<br>
overwhelming evidence.<br>
<p>
I know from my own experience that I can train my own emotional<br>
responses to a large degree.  How else could I get angry at Statist<br>
and Theist propaganda when I was raised a Baptist and Democrat?<br>
It would be just as silly to take either of the extreme positions<br>
of this debate as it is any other nature/nurture debate.  The only<br>
questions are percentages, consequences, and techniques.<br>
