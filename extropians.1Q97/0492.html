Although you are correct in most respects, you are exhibiting a common human<br>
bias towards water-based chemistry.  In much the same way people adopted a<br>
decimal numbering system, most people (even many chemists) adopt a<br>
water-based chemical view.  Fact is, the choice of base solvents can be<br>
pretty much arbitrary.  The influence of water on us and our world tends to<br>
creep into our assumptions about life on other worlds.<br>
<p>
Evidence of this can be seen in most university inorganic chemistry classes.<br>
Everyone learns inorganic chemistry under the assumption that water is the<br>
solvent.  At the lower class levels, they don't even suggest that there is<br>
an entire parallel universe of chemical interactions based on, say, an H2S<br>
solvent environment.  <br>
<p>
That said, I must say that water *is* a good solvent for life environments,<br>
but it is by no means an exclusive club.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Furthermore, any possible life forms developing on planets vastly</i><br>
<i>&gt;dissimilar to our own would of neccessity have vastly different goals, </i><br>
<i>&gt;resource needs, and would not compete with us for planets, as what we</i><br>
<i>&gt;would find optimum would not neccessarily be optimum for such vastly</i><br>
<i>&gt;different life forms, so we would probably have little interaction</i><br>
<i>&gt;outside of information trade, assuming that we could even communicate.</i><br>
<p>
In the situation you describe above, we might not be competing for living<br>
space, but we would be competing for resources.  A rich palladium deposit is<br>
valuable whether you breathe oxygen or methane, and technology should allow<br>
us to retrieve these materials from almost any environment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So now we know that an intelligent life form on another earthlike world</i><br>
<i>&gt;will most likely be a carbon based biped. We can also infer that due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficeincy/performance of optical/auditory arrangments, that the biped</i><br>
<i>&gt;will have two eyes, as well as two ears. Will it see in our visible</i><br>
<i>&gt;range? That depends on the spectra of the sun around which the planet</i><br>
<i>&gt;orbits, but there must not be a high level of UV, as UV breaks down DNA</i><br>
<i>&gt;rapidly and kills microorganisms, esp. the plankton. Given the spectra</i><br>
<i>&gt;that an oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere, with a protective EM radiation belt,</i><br>
<i>&gt;allows through, the peak output of a near sunlike star at planetary</i><br>
<i>&gt;surfaces will be in the visible and near visible range. Evolution will</i><br>
<i>&gt;take advantage of that, and eyes will develop sensitivity to whatever is</i><br>
<i>&gt;most efficient, i.e. the visible range. Since two eyes is the minimum</i><br>
<i>&gt;needed for stereoscopic vision, evolution willnot waste time with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;third eye, and likewise for ears.</i><br>
<p>
I don't agree with your assumption of two eyes and ears.  In most organisms,<br>
the number of sensors is a tradeoff between necessity, capability, and<br>
processing power.  There is no requirement for a minimum number of<br>
auditory/optical sensors.  Especially in the case of auditory sensors,<br>
having more increases your auditory capabilities significantly.<br>
Technically, you could detect and process surround sound with a single ear.<br>
However, this would require considerably more processing power be devoted to<br>
processing the signal.  The fact that we have two ears eases the processing<br>
requirements significantly.  The processing load for humans could be<br>
significantly lessened if we had additional ears.  For example, humans have<br>
poor front-back discrimination.  The processing used by the brain to<br>
accomplish this with only two ears amounts to a complex spectral analysis in<br>
addition to other sensory queues, such as visual.  A third ear would<br>
substantially minimize the need for this type of processing, and a fourth<br>
ear (poor up-down discrimination, too) would eliminate it all together.  But<br>
apparently evolution thought it was "good enough" in our case and had<br>
processing power to spare.  The directional ears found on many animals are<br>
ways of combatting the discrimination limits of two ears without increasing<br>
the brain requirements.  On an alien world, it would be hard to ascertain<br>
what the evolutionary path may be.<br>
<p>
I generally agree that eyes are most likely to be a single pair, but this is<br>
by no means certain either.  There are many species of lower animals with<br>
many eyes, and in some predator rich environments, it might be advantageous<br>
to have more than a pair of eyes.  The obvious drawback is that many good<br>
eyes require significant quantities of processing power to go with each of<br>
them, which is the reason I believe they did not commonly evolve, especially<br>
in higher animals.  <br>
<p>
You are correct in your assessment of the visible wavelength range, but I<br>
wanted to add a point or two.  Many animals, including the higher animals,<br>
can see into the UV range, and for some animals the visible range goes into<br>
the infrared as well.  There are good chemical reasons for vision in these<br>
ranges.  It should also be pointed out that as the frequency gets lower,<br>
sensory resolution tends to degrade.  And besides, sensitivity to microwave<br>
frequencies, for example, would be nearly useless to most animals.<br>
