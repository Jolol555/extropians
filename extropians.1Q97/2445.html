<p>
Joy, Omega, Lyle, Michael Butler, Jim Legg -- there were already <br>
at least five before Eliezer, and I think I forgot somebody else who <br>
said he was leaving.  I sent a who-extropians message tonight and <br>
found that sw@tiac.net is no longer on the list.  And David Musick <br>
hasn't been heard from recently, although he hasn't unsubscribed.  <br>
<p>
I've been watching  (with a certain shadenfreude  &lt;evil g&gt; ) <br>
as the leaving-the-list meme runs its course.  <br>
<p>
QueeneMUSE and Natasha object to Eliezer's overdramatic exit.  <br>
I don't understand this attitude at all.  If you just disappear without <br>
saying goodbye, then you weren't really there in the first place.  <br>
<p>
I want to present my fond-memories-of-the-list awards to --  <br>
<p>
Steve Witham, author of the posts I will still be thinking about <br>
   when I have forgotten most of the others;   <br>
Anders, who will find/create his laughing god; <br>
Eugene, who ought to know green grass when he sees it; <br>
Michael Wiik, who had the balls to bring up the subject I <br>
   wouldn't touch; <br>
Damien X, the most solid and unpretentious of the youngsters; <br>
David and Eliezer, who gave me a bizarre mirror of myself <br>
   in my late teens; <br>
Omega, who would have raised the discussion to a higher level <br>
   if he had stayed; <br>
Chris, the most enthusiastic; <br>
Robin Hanson, a counterexample to Eliezer's assertion that <br>
   "extropian heavyweight" is an oxymoron; <br>
John Clark, who should look deeply into the origin of Newton's <br>
   concept of force; <br>
James Rogers, who taught me many things; <br>
Ray Peck, who will find his /asu suralokasya/ one of these days;<br>
Hara Ra, whose miracles require absolute forgetfulness.  <br>
<p>
Hmm... that's quite a few people -- and I could add others --  <br>
I wonder if I shouldn't stay on the list after all.  But, no.  <br>
There's got to be a better way to do this.  I'm going to back off <br>
and start over. <br>
<p>
I'll see you at the Hyperchess Tournament.  <br>
<p>
Lyle <br>
