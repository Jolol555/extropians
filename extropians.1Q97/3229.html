<i>&gt; way to know if your vague feeling that you should head toward that</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing that looks like up stairs is something real and testable, rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; than pure chance patterns.  Do you really start writing down numbers?</i><br>
<p>
If I wanted to make specific predictions about them, I'd have to have<br>
some way to test whether my actual results matched my descriptions;<br>
that is, I'd have to discover some /definable, observable, difference/<br>
between what is and what might be, and some way to recognize which of<br>
those matches my prediction.  Such definable, observable differences<br>
are called "measurements".  They don't all have to superficially look<br>
like numbers with units, like "9.8 m/s^2", although those are very<br>
good ones; sometimes they are simply records of distinct observation.<br>
"Yes/No" is your basic one-bit number, and a very good measurement of<br>
things like "the rat found the cheese/the rat didn't find the cheese".<br>
What makes it specifically quantitative is that I can rigorously<br>
define what the measurement is, and I can repeat the experiment<br>
enough times to calculate a t-test or other measure of the probability<br>
that the measurements are chance or that they correlate to some cause.<br>
<p>
99% of the measurements you make are subconscious, so you're right<br>
that I don't have to count every step or label every room to get to<br>
where I'm going.  But to make predictions, or to explain things to<br>
someone else, I'd better make them more explicit: if I want to tell<br>
someone that there is an alien corpse in a certain room, I'd better<br>
specify exactly which room of which building at what point on the<br>
planet at which point in time, and define what distinguishes my<br>
claim of "alien corpse" from something else, or else my claim isn't<br>
independently verifiable.  And how did you get to your office the<br>
first time?  By looking for distinguishing measurements of the<br>
building among others--it's order in the street, its height, its<br>
color, its shape, or some other set of measurements.<br>
<p>
I'm not discounting the value of human pattern-matching machinery.<br>
That's what gives us conjectures to test, and it is a very valuable<br>
skill.  But until they are defined, measured, and tested, it is a<br>
very dangerous game to make predictions on pattern alone.<br>
