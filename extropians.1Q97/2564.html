From: John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; I don't see how the subjective could ever be made objective. Suppose a mind </i><br>
<i>&gt; reading machine told me that when you see the color red you have same </i><br>
<i>&gt; subjective experience that I do, red looks the same to you as it does for me. </i><br>
<i>&gt; How could I ever know if the machine was giving me correct information? </i><br>
<i>&gt; The operating principles of the machine would have to be based on some theory</i><br>
<i>&gt; of consciousness, but I'd have no way of knowing if that theory was correct. </i><br>
<p>
Ok, suppose it is done without the aid of a machine, but directly.  It turns<br>
out that ESP and telepathy is possible with the right training.  In time<br>
you learn to directly perceive the innards of another person's mind.  You<br>
see what he sees, follow his thoughts, feel what it is like to be him.<br>
<p>
Now, if you're going to start suggesting that you don't know if this<br>
is real, that you can't be sure that you are really feeling what he<br>
feels, then this starts to sound like solipsism.  You would be directly<br>
perceiving his mind, and to deny these perceptions would be no more<br>
justified than to deny the other perceptions you have.  How do you<br>
know that the world is really there, that your senses are giving you<br>
the right information?  I think the answer is that we accept it because<br>
our senses give us a consistent picture.  Other people report the same<br>
things, our sense cross check each other consistently, and it all adds up.<br>
<p>
If the same thing were true of these mental perceptions, then I'd say we<br>
would have equal grounds to accept them as real.  If the person whose mind<br>
I am reading agrees with my statements about what he seems to be feeling,<br>
if other people reading his mind perceive the same things I do, then I have<br>
grounds for believing them to be real.<br>
<p>
There could also be an underlying theory which puts our observations into<br>
a logical framework.  If I perceive your reds to be greenish, then it<br>
might be logical that you would perceive my reds to have a purple shade.<br>
With a body of consistent observations like this we have further grounds<br>
for accepting these perceptions.<br>
<p>
Granted, the existence of this kind of telepathy may be hard to accept,<br>
but I don't think we could say that it is impossible.  And even if it<br>
turns out that mechanical intervention is necessary, it would still seem<br>
that the reasoning above would apply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is an even more fundamental problem. My brain is different than yours, </i><br>
<i>&gt;so If I want to know what it's like to be you I'd need something that could </i><br>
<i>&gt;translate the states of your brain into states that my brain could understand. </i><br>
<i>&gt;If I did that then I'd know what it's like for John Clark to be Hal Finney.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately that's not what I want, and the only way for me to know what </i><br>
<i>&gt;it's like for Hal Finney to be Hal Finney is to turn my brain into an exact </i><br>
<i>&gt;copy of yours. Even then "I" wouldn't know what it's like to be you, because </i><br>
<i>&gt;"I" wouldn't be John Clark anymore, I'd be Hal Finney.</i><br>
<p>
This is a little too philosophical for me.  It's not clear what it means<br>
for John Clark to be Hal Finney, and how that differs from Hal Finney being<br>
Hal Finney.  Suppose that while John Clark is being Hal Finney, he feels<br>
exactly the same as Hal Finney being Hal Finney.  Then, when the mind reading<br>
is over, he goes back to feeling like John Clark, but he still has his memories<br>
of what it felt like to be Hal Finney (or to be Hal Finney feeling like he<br>
was Hal Finney?  the mind reels...).<br>
<p>
In any case, as I said I think this overanalyzes the situation, like the<br>
guy who said he wasn't seeing the world, he was seeing his retina.  Given<br>
a world in which mind reading was possible with consistent, logical results<br>
as I described, I think we would naturally accept these perceptions on a<br>
par with those of our other senses.  There might be some people who refuse<br>
to, just as there are no doubt people today who refuse to accept the<br>
evidence of their senses.  But this could put them at a disadvantage, and<br>
I suspect they would be relatively few.<br>
