 I just read a piece in my favorite periodical - "Breakthrough!" on<br>
"MIPsucking" - a method of using Java scripts embedded in Web pages that<br>
is, in Sean Morgan's words, "technically capable of transforming a Web<br>
site into a massively parallel meta-supercomputer that draws on the unused<br>
cycles of visiting machines". <br>
<p>
 Maybe, this can also be used as a model of user's payment for content.<br>
Currently, the advertisement model is:<br>
<p>
 - the site collects a pool of ads and distributes them to the visiting<br>
machines.  The user pays for a page view with extra few seconds wait for<br>
downloading the ad, smaller viewing space, and distraction.  The ad, as<br>
always, works (gets clicked on) 1% to 5% of the time.  The advertisers<br>
pay the site and then try to figure out how much use they got out of this.<br>
<p>
 The MIPsucking model would be:<br>
<p>
- the site collects a pool of computations to be performed and distributes<br>
them to visiting machines. The user pays with unused machine cycles and<br>
time to load the script. (The script load time can be made unnoticeable<br>
as well, as the script, unlike the ad, can be downloaded *after* the<br>
page load.)  No screen space, no user distraction, works 100% of the time<br>
(with the exception of interrupted connections)  The companies who ordered<br>
the computations would get immediate results - exactly what they paid for.<br>
<p>
  The MIP payments may also be viewed as more "democratic" as they will<br>
extract greater payments from more powerful users, while ad viewing is<br>
more taxing for people with slower modems and smaller screens.<br>
<p>
 Maybe, this technique will become the prevalent method of payment for<br>
content browsing?  Or at least, the user would be able to specify, in<br>
some browser option, the payment method: "ads, MIPs, microcash, other" ?<br>
<p>
 I wonder what kinds of computations can be performed this way.<br>
