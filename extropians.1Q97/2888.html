I think it would be hard to over emphasize the importance of this new cloning <br>
development. The New York Times, not noted for their sensationalism, talked  <br>
about cloning the dead. It would be interesting to talk to a clone of <br>
Einstein or Darwin or Newton or Shakespeare, they even mentioned a clone of <br>
Jesus, or at least, a  clone of the person who's blood is in relics and<br>
claimed to be from Jesus.<br>
 <br>
There is also the question of somebody making a clone of you without your <br>
permission or even your knowledge. The Pope may thunder against the evils of <br>
it, but it would only take one fleck of papal dandruff to make a clone of the <br>
Pope. There are more down to earth medical applications too.<br>
<p>
In the last few years Genetic Engineers have done some pretty impressive work, <br>
but almost entirely with single cell life, and the reason is that we could <br>
clone them, in fact that's the natural way this form of life reproduces. <br>
When you insert a gene into a cell it almost never finds its way to the <br>
correct place on the chromosome and gets expressed properly. It may take <br>
millions or billions of attempts before everything works, but if you also <br>
include a signaling gene for antibiotic resistance or for the production of <br>
a small amount of florescent dye, you can find the one successful cell out of <br>
billions and then clone it and make as  many as you want.<br>
<p>
This didn't work for mammals because nobody had billions of fertilized egg  <br>
cells to work with, so little Genetic Engineering was done on mammals. <br>
Now we can use any mammal cell, they're very easy to obtain and you can put <br>
millions of them in one small test tube. Find the one cell that expresses<br>
the new gene correctly and then use it to clone an animal.<br>
<p>
I predict that very soon somebody will insert human genes for the surface  <br>
proteins of cells that the immune system uses for recognition into pig cells.  <br>
They will find the one cell out of billions that correctly expresses these <br>
genes and then they will clone an animal. The result will be an animal who's <br>
organs work as well for transplantation into people as human organs do. <br>
The next step would be to engineer an animal for use by one specific <br>
individual, then a pig heart would work as well in you as one from your <br>
identical twin brother, if you had one.<br>
<p>
It's a little more speculative but the womb such a pig that recognized human  <br>
tissue as its own might be a good home for a human embryo for 9 months<br>
