Me too (sorry ;-)). Having just returned from six months of travel I can<br>
certainly say that the real thing is a lot better than photographs and TV.<br>
You also have the problem that if uploads are a thousand times faster than<br>
humans then the other side of the Earth will seem almost as far away to<br>
them as other planets are to us. That is, 1/7 of a second (rough minimum<br>
round-trip time for communications) will seem like three "human" minutes<br>
to them, making teleprescence very difficult. <br>
<p>
As Chris said, downloading into a physical drone is the obvious solution,<br>
but I wonder how many uploads would be willing to take the risk of<br>
downloading into a potentially untrustworthy physical body when they could<br>
sit safely inside their own computer at home. You can encrypt yourself<br>
while you pass across the network, but who knows what 'Kangaroo<br>
Rent-a-bod' will do with you when you get there? Your competitors or<br>
enemies might pay a lot of money for a copy of your software[1]. <br>
<p>
The solution to that would seem to be to make your own computer mobile,<br>
make a backup and jump on a 747. Hmm, haven't we been here before ;-) ? <br>

[1] This seems to be a fundamental problem with the standard concept of<br>
uploads, where you simply exist as a distributed process on the Net and<br>
travel around whenever you feel like doing so. If you build your own<br>
computer to run on then you can trust that it's not bugged, but if someone<br>
taps the link you travel over or the remote computer you're running on<br>
then they can copy your software and run it on a 'supercomputer' (i.e. <br>
something a lot faster than the normal computers you run on) to simulate<br>
you. They can then run the simulation as often as neccesary until they<br>
find a reward that will motivate you to do whatever they wish. This won't<br>
be perfect because your experiences in the intervening time will change<br>
you, but it should often work.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know if this has already been covered in fiction? I think<br>
Anders once mentioned something similar occuring in an RPG. <br>
