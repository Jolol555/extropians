Though I haven't heard about such densities, it strenghtens the case of <br>
retina being very special. Extrapolations based on the retina <br>
(extrapolations, not speculations) will hold merely for the retina, and <br>
not anywhere else.<br>

his recent writings, even way beyond Tipler, whose Omega point theory at <br>

make one passive. A belief system can be a dangerous thing).<br>

Sure, it's _comparatively_ simple and easily accessible.<br>

I won't comment on that. I mean I already did, but I won't.<br>

<p>
A bee's, or a fly's brain is sure a very small object (1 mm^3, or so), <br>
and it sure does an awful lot of computations to survive in a complex, <br>
unfriendly environment (hmm, this makes me want to rush out instantly, and <br>
read up on insect neuroarchitecture). The question is: how much smaller <br>
can the system get? How much faster? At equivalent speed, what would its <br>
power requirements be? Intuitively, or, as an educated guess, one, two <br>
orders of magnitude, no more.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well of course it's Science Fiction, nobody has done it yet, and 10^9 is </i><br>
<p>
The main difference between "fantasy" and "science fiction" is imo "science".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; probably closer to the truth.</i><br>
<p>
I think you are way off the correct numbers, but I won't repeat all the <br>
arguments why.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;not even very good science fiction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; For me good Science Fiction extends current ideas to the absolute limit </i><br>
<i>&gt; without breaking the laws of Physics. I think a sugar cube sized super brain  </i><br>
<p>
"without breaking the laws of Physics". Yes. Trouble is, basic laws do <br>
not allow us to talk about constraints of complex objects. We know <br>
(assuming no femtotech) atoms to be the smallest utilizable structures, <br>
(not even atoms but clusters of them) to define the lower horizon of <br>
implementability, and we can observe biological information processing <br>
systems. We know electronical systems to be much faster than mechanical <br>
ones, and we know maximal switching speeds in a given volume dictated by <br>
bond photodissotiation energies. We don't know whether we will have <br>
drextech, with its diamondoid matrix and fractal cooling channels, <br>
allowing it to operate at astronomic power densties, without turning <br>
into lava instantly.<br>
<p>
There is still a whole lot what we do not know yet. So I prefer to take a <br>
conservative stance (in mundane life most people think I am a lunatic, <br>
but here I'm actually a conservative. Amazing), which is less embarassing <br>
on the long run. But then people forget.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is very good Science Fiction.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it certainly makes a jolly good read.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Darwin doesn't operate on individuals, but on populations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the unit of natural selection is the population then what constitutes a  </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I should have stated that differently. A population of <br>
imperferfectly autoreplicating entities in a limited-resource environment<br>
is a necessary and sufficient condition for darwinian evolution to emerge. <br>
Better?<br>
<p>
Meaning, no population, no evolution. No more, no less.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; population? Are The Extropians a population? How about a nation, or the  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Human Race, or primates or mammals or vertebrates or animals or life in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; general?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Darwin doesn't operate on individuals, but on genes, the basic unit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduction.                                   </i><br>
<p>
A gene does not reproduce outside of its wet context, the animal cell. <br>
Besides, darwinian evolution is not limited to systems having genes (or <br>
bits, or whatever), just inheritable, mutable properties which have impact <br>
on system's fitness.<br>
