The same research showed it was because they choose to eat at macdonalds<br>
instead of eat a carefully balanced diet. I heared that Labour already<br>
passed a law that should forbid everyone under 18 to eat fast food. The<br>
same law will take steps to make every motorist pass a monthly test<br>
checking vitamin levels. The extra tax on cars goes to taking on special<br>
'vitamin guards' who will patrol near junk food outlets and arcade parks,<br>
spotting suspicious looking pimples.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The only thing that surprises me is that so many decide not to eat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Stupid children.</i><br>
<p>
I heard they went on hunger strike because they found out they were not<br>
allowed their daily macdonalds any longer. Tax decrease on cigarettes was<br>
another of their demands. Smart kids.  <br>

Have you seen Unimation/Westinghouse new UK slogan for marketing their new<br>
SCARA robot arms ?: 'A kid can operate our robot arm',<br>
<p>
They even changed the name to SKARA: Smart Kid Assembly Robot Arm<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Best starting age is probably at the age of 9 or 10, when they're &gt;young</i><br>
and ready to learn. <br>
<p>
Possibly a good thing in view of recent predictions that soon kids this age<br>
will be the ONLY ones able to operate mechatronics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;we simply strike out public welfare, and the problem solves itself! &gt;And</i><br>
anyone who dies from hunger or gets ill or both is of course &gt;guilty<br>
himself! Had he done as much as he could -- he would have &gt;survived.<br>
Wouldn't he? <br>
<p>
Why yes, ofcourse they're stupid. They could have just popped over to the<br>
macdonalds, where both types of stock are now rotting away. I hear the<br>
'vitamin guards' don't bother you too much when you have no money. Some say<br>
they even become friendly to you...       <br>
