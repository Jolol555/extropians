<i>&gt; Still this says very little about those Nimravidae, i know</i><br>
<i>&gt; sabertooths were big (fatalis WAS as big as a lion), i also know</i><br>
<i>&gt; they were not very smart,</i><br>
<p>
  I am commenting a little out of sequence, but even if we had a clear<br>
idea of how cranial capacity correlated with "smartness", it is not<br>
clear to me how one can infer much about relative cranial capacity<br>
from exterior skull morphology when comparing such rather different<br>
genera as _Pantera_ and _Smilodon_.  It takes a lot of structure to<br>
support those big teeth, that jaw, and the muscles which move them;<br>
one would expect the shape of the skull to be considerably different<br>
in consequence.<br>
  Furthermore, if sabertooths used their canines for close-quarters<br>
slashing attacks, evolution might have favored a more enclosed and<br>
robustly protected brain.  I suspect there are cranial-volume<br>
measurements somewhere to look at; it would be wise to dig them out.<br>
  In the absence of data, 5 My is not a long time in the history of<br>
mammals -- which after all, go back some 230 My (to the split with<br>
reptiles); one would _a_priori_ expect great differences in<br>
intelligence across the former span to be the exception (as with<br>
hominids) rather than the rule.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but more importantly, they didn't live in Africa.</i><br>
<p>
  Um, certainly they did.  If memory serves, genus _Smilodon_ and<br>
perhaps a larger taxon was new-world only, and _Smilodon_ is what most<br>
people popularly call "the" [sic] saber-toothed tiger.  Yet there were<br>
lots of other large-toothed cats, distributed worldwide.  Have you<br>
possibly confused the limits of _Smilodon_'s range with the limits of<br>
all large-toothed cats?  _Homotherium_ is one genus whose distribution<br>
included Africa.  I am pretty sure there were lots of others,<br>
including large ones, but I would probably have to hit the library and<br>
dig some to find out which -- I don't think the information is in the<br>
texts I have at home.  I think I recall from previous postings that<br>
you have been searching the web -- I think what you have to do is<br>
search library stacks, or find an on-line abstracts database and dig<br>
through that, or perhaps merely a good paleontology book.<br>
  Based on the thirty-or-so million-year history of the cat family,<br>
its widespread general success (as still evident today), and the<br>
several separate occasions on which it has spawned lion-sized<br>
predators, one might well argue that in any Miocene or later<br>
new-world, Eurasian or African environment in which large game was<br>
present, large cats would have been present to feed on it, but one<br>
doesn't need to be nearly so wishy-washy; there is data.  If you wish<br>
to use absence of evidence as evidence of absence (of large cats in<br>
Pliocene and Pleistocene Africa), I don't see any way to avoid turning<br>
over every scrap of evidence that has been published, and I fear that<br>
most of it is not on the web.<br>
<p>
  Actually, I myself don't have any problem with the idea that<br>
_Australopithecus_afarensis_ could cope with the presence of large<br>
cats in one way or another, as I have indicated in other postings on<br>
this thread; that is, I don't think one needs to assume that for<br>
_A._afarensis_ to have survived, it must have only encountered small<br>
predators.<br>
<p>
  Incidentally, there has been some rather interesting work done on<br>
food-source selection; given a wide variety of choices of foodstuff,<br>
most animals tend to specialize on only a few.  There seems to be a<br>
tradeoff involving how much effort one spends to get food and how<br>
much food value one gets by doing so, that has a rather sharp cutoff.<br>
Thus most predators are capable of taking a much wider variety of prey<br>
than they usually do (and will switch habits if a more preferred species<br>
should become scarce, or for some other reason).  One must thus <br>
distinguish carefully between whether a predator can take a particular<br>
kind of prey, and whether it actually does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Many other homonid and homonoid species were bipedal, why didn't they</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop intelligence ? why did they become extinct instead, just because</i><br>
<i>&gt; there was one who was better ? </i><br>
<p>
  That seems to me like an entirely sufficient reason...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did it say if [early stone tools were] found alongside habiles</i><br>
<i>&gt; skeletons or among afarensis ?</i><br>
<p>
  Probably just "found", not necessarily in close proximity to hominid<br>
remains.  One rarely has such luck.<br>
