<i>&gt;Extropians,  I think that Extropian memes are not well known in the</i><br>

<p>
Explaining extropy by using the Singularity as a reference could have<br>
resulted in the SF responses you received.  The same could have been true by<br>
using cryonics.<br>
<p>
Explaining extropy by using its philosophical implications and its<br>
relationship to each individual could prove to be more of an eye-opener to<br>
individuals who cannot grok the more far-sighted ideas of extropy. The<br>
definition of extropy is clear.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I tried to spread some Extropian memes</i><br>
<i>&gt;amongst a very Earth-centered electronic mailing list dedicated to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;American writer Edward Abbey who wrote books such as the MONKEY WRENCH</i><br>
<i>&gt;GANG which inspired environmental activist groups.</i><br>
<p>
Dealing with environmental activists can be tricky, but not impossible. I<br>
view it as a challenge.  Before I became an extropian, although a<br>
transhuman, indeed, I was an elected official for the Green Party (Council<br>
person for the 27th senatorial district here in LA) I learned a bit about<br>
the inside-thinking of environmentalists. Although I did not make a dent in<br>
the overall thinking of this environmentalist contingency, I did wake up a<br>
few folks to the future. An extropian can appropriately debate an<br>
environmental point with solid and resourceful information.  It just takes a<br>
bit of ingenuity. Greg Burch has some valid information on his Web site that<br>
can be helpful.=20<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I got a mixture of responses.  Some expressed interest in Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;memes.  Others gave responses such as:  "the Extropians have only one</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideal: self-preservation , not very lofty".</i><br>
<p>
I'm assuming this is the cryonics associations.  No, its not our only ideal,<br>
simply one of them. Take it as a challenge and back it up with quotes from<br>
Max in his debate on the HotWired series.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Others view the Extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt;as "cyber bionic wanna bes" who dream of living out some sci-fi related</i><br>
<i>&gt;crap in an alternative future life".=20</i><br>
<p>
Here is a great lead-in to bring up the most ardent advances in<br>
biotechnology and how it manifests in everyone's life.=20<br>
<p>
A proactive way of dealing with slurs of speech intended to provoke and<br>
coming from a place of ignorance is to suggest reading material to your<br>
opponent and back it up with accessible quotes from extropians who have been<br>
published and who have a way with words.<br>
