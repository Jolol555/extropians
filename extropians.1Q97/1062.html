<i>&gt; What fascinates me about this is that I wrote exactly the same thing </i><br>
<i>&gt; when I was your age.  I was anti-racist and anti-sexist; I was every bit </i><br>
<i>&gt; as strident, every bit as self-righteous, as you.  This behaviour has </i><br>
<i>&gt; puzzled me ever since.  </i><br>
<p>
Have you ever heard of evolutionary psychology?<br>
<p>
And again, I think that everyone here is getting confused - like the<br>
"memetic" confusion between strong and weak and good and bad and Good<br>
and Evil.  I have made the following two statements, which are not<br>
mutually inconsistent:<br>
<p>
1)  Our evolved emotional psychology should not be allowed to interfere<br>
    with our rational reasoning; nor should it be regarded as a logical<br>
    or even rational argument in favor of anything; that is simply the<br>
    naturalistic "is implies should" in other form.<br>
<p>
2)  Our evolved emotional psychology is highly adapted for the purpose<br>
    of arguing; there's nothing wrong with an emotional argument as long<br>
    as it would appear true to a non-emotional being.  Nor is there<br>
    anything wrong with allowing yourself to experience emotion while<br>
    arguing.  Otherwise, you fall apart mentally AND you lose.<br>
<p>
So please stop trying to indict me on grounds of inconsistency every<br>
time I reveal that I share your emotional architecture; save your breath<br>
for when my emotions lead me into error or I raise an argument with<br>
nothing but morality to support it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I want to know.  I want to Know.  I want to trace this phenomenon </i><br>
<i>&gt; back to its roots.  Why are we driven to destroy ourselves?</i><br>
<p>
"Destroy ourselves"?  I would say that teenage males are driven to see<br>
the current political "Establishment" as being corrupted and evil.  This<br>
can cause even more mischief if they map their fathers to "tribal<br>
chief".  But in any case, the answer to your question is that teenage<br>
males are driven to accept Causes, because in the ancestral environment<br>
joining (or better, promulgating) Causes was the way to rise in the<br>
social hierarchy, thus increasing one's chances of reproductive success.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I read over your post, Eliezer, I see one thing:  you feel threatened.  </i><br>
<p>
BECAUSE *I* WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE STATISTICS HE WAS QUOTING!<br>
<p>
I object, I very *strongly* object, to my efforts on the SAT winding up<br>
providing this fruitcake with ammunition for his chauvinism.  I can't<br>
write and ask him to adjust the statistics to remove me from<br>
consideration.  I am scientific data.  I cannot *not* be scientific<br>
data.  But in that I did, in some small way, contribute to this person's<br>
delusion, it is my responsibility to counter it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your self-concept is at stake.  The issue, to you,  is not whether </i><br>
<i>&gt; there ever has been or ever could be a female Goedel or a female Bach;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; the only issue is whether you or de Garis is the better man.  Why?  </i><br>
<p>
Well... again going into evolutionary psychology, he holds to a<br>
political cause that opposes mine.  You might therefore say that the<br>
nature of the conflict mapped to a political challenge.  Was there a<br>
better format?  I admit that I didn't make the decision to phrase it<br>
that way... or at least didn't *phrase* my decision that way;  I had the<br>
choice of writing a dry and rational statement, or of declaring my<br>
opposition.  I chose to declare my opposition.  The facts are not<br>
something I can alter by writing a letter; the most my letter could<br>
acheive was an emotional (or as I would now say, a political) effect.  I<br>
admit that I didn't choose the emotional format in which that opposition<br>
presented itself.<br>
<p>
That having been said, thanks for the tip, Lyle - next time, I'll do it<br>
consciously.<br>
<p>
And keep up the good work on trying to point out inconsistencies; I<br>
doubt you'll ever catch me in a logical inconsistency - the worst case<br>
is getting careless and not living up to my ideal of perfection, as now<br>
- but it does clear the air.<br>
