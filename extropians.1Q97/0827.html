<i>&gt; I don't believe you, Daniel. I agree that emotion does not necessarily cloud</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason. The old Star Trek style opposition of reason and emotion is a poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; picture of reality. However, emotional responses *can* make it extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to think rationally, while under their influence. When "wallowing"</i><br>
<i>&gt; in an emotion, I think for humans it's hard not to let it interfere with</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason. In some situations, the best thing is to realize that your ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to think clearly and from various perspectives is currently impaired, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; put off making decisions and judgments if possible. I think this is more</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational than convincing yourself that you can completely set aside</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently raging feelings to think perfectly rationally.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps "postponing judgment" is one useful technique for dealing with<br>
emotional interference upon reason.  I must agree that if nothing else,<br>
emotions can occupy the mind's time, or encourage thoughtless action, and<br>
so interfere with reason in that sense.  But wouldn't it be good, perhaps<br>
even better, to develop techniques that eliminate the interference in the<br>
first place?  Isn't it just as easy to learn "Don't let it bother you"<br>
as to learn "Don't do that while you're upset."?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While I agree with some of the other points you make, and sympathize with</i><br>
<i>&gt; your general approach, I think you've missed QueenMUSE's point. She did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; say that emotions are *reliable* guides to action, only that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable guides. She's right. Emotions involve subsconsious judgments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; *Sometimes* these can tell us things that we have not consciously realized.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Denying this in favor of a view that only fully conscious reasoning provides</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful information flies in the face of evolution and psychology.</i><br>
<p>
Point taken.  I am concerned, though, when I reflect that the loved ones<br>
of a sick man in the 1700's let their compassion for the sick, and their<br>
respect for a venerable doctor, allow the latter to bleed the former to<br>
the point of death.  Certainly, that same compassion will lead someone<br>
today to give real help, but there is a fine line between _using_ one's<br>
emotions and _relying_ upon them, and I want to make sure I stay clear<br>
from that line.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nathaniel Branden explores these ideas in detail in his books. He started</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the simpler Randian model that you seem to advocate, but developed a</i><br>
<i>&gt; view that grants emotions more of a role, while still strongly advocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscious reason as the final arbiter.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, he's gotten a little touchy-feely in his old age. :)  Though I must<br>
admit I still like him a lot more than that idiot Rand dumped him for.<br>
