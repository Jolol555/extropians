California Suicide Group Ran Web Programming Service<br>
<p>
****California Suicide Group Ran Web Programming Service 03/27/97 TOKYO,=20<br>
JAPAN, 1997<br>
MAR 27 (NB) -- By Martyn Williams. The deaths of at least 39 people in=20<br>
Rancho Santa Fe, California, in what appears to be a mass suicide, has a=20<br>
connection with the Internet. The group were apparently members of a=20<br>
religious group, World Wide Higher Source, and that they financed=20<br>
operations by running a Web site design and programming service, "Higher=20<br>
Source Contract Services."=20<br>
<p>
The company has designed a handful of Web sites including those of the=20<br>
San Diego Polo Club, a<br>
Christian music site called Keep The Faith, a company specializing in=20<br>
British classic cars called British Masters, and a camera retailer,=20<br>
Newsbytes has learned.=20<br>
<p>
The group has its own domain, highersource.com, and usually runs a Web=20<br>
server from the address<br>
<a href="http://www.highersource.com">http://www.highersource.com</a> , but this appears to be offline at present,=20<br>
as are some of the client Web sites which are also run from the machine.=20<br>
The computer in question was, however, still connected to the Internet=20<br>
when Newsbytes checked at 8am EST.=20<br>
<p>
Exhaustive Internet searches have revealed little else about the group,=20<br>
and nothing related to religion. Apart from the group's own Web site,=20<br>
for its Web design business, the only other related items are a large=20<br>
number of messages on Usenet from someone appeared related to the group=20<br>
and its business.=20<br>
<p>
An idea of the secrecy of the group can be found in the information=20<br>
submitted in the domain name database when it acquired the<br>
highersource.com domain name. "We have no one here of that name and I=20<br>
don't know where the gentlemen ever got that number," a<br>
Ramada Inn employee answered when we attempted to contact "Ben Guiat,"=20<br>
the listed contact person.=20<br>
<p>
The e-mail listed as a contact, font@cris.com, appeared in 27 different=20<br>
Usenet messages alongside the name "Stewart Craft." All the<br>
messages found were concerned with Web programming. The most recent=20<br>
messages were posted exactly one month ago, on February<br>
27th. Newsbytes did discover a mirror of the down Higher Source Web site=20<br>
is available at <a href="http://www.cris.com/~font">http://www.cris.com/~font</a> , but reveals little<br>
about the group except for its Web design service.=20<br>
