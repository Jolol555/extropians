I have to agree.  I have to because this question is so ambiguous.  I just<br>
got back from a belly dancing class earlier, and a lot of ? ran through my<br>
head, like "oh ghee I feel clutzy", "I'm not doing this right" etc.   I<br>
realized this is all mind frame play.  Even though I drove home in a full<br>
moon it was shrouded by mist and all that represents that in the subconscious.<br>
<p>
I've heard that this list is on the HOT side, so I will not offer myself to<br>
the sacrificial altar yet, I don't even know what this altar is comprised<br>
of!  I will wait until I see what people on this list have to offer of a<br>
positive value.  <br>
<p>
As to "what is reality" that is a question that as far as I know is not<br>
answerable...you yourself is the barometer of reality... ans I guess that<br>
is the  trick!<br>
