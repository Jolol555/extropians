Reciprocity agreements? I remember they used to have a problem with<br>
private fire-insurance companies slugging it out with one another for<br>
the right to put out a fire in an uninsured home, figuring they could<br>
manage to collect something later. (Incidents like these were used in <br>
arguments for municipalization of the fire departments, or so I've<br>
heard.) But it seems to me that reciprocity agreements worked out in<br>
advance could narrow the problem down to the uninsured (or "outlaws").<br>
Who would still present a problem in the situation you describe above.<br>
<p>
But I think the best deterrent againt violent crime is having a<br>
random distribution of 10% of the population trained and armed and<br>
legally capable of defending themselves and their property. That<br>
deterrent is presently being vigorously undermined in the United<br>
States, and I doubt that either public law enforcement or PPA<br>
contracts will do half as good a job.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Are people assumed to protect themselves from that kind of thing</i><br>
<i> &gt;and only call on the protection agency if the situation gets out</i><br>
<i> &gt;of hand? This obviously works for crimes which are reported after</i><br>
<i> &gt;the fact, but not if someone attacks me while I'm walking down the</i><br>
<i> &gt;street.</i><br>
<p>
Compare it to the system we have now. I've been attacked on the<br>
street three times now in my life, and none of those times were<br>
any public cops present. On one of those occasions I was assisted<br>
by a private "Good Samaritan" who pulled up to the curb and frightened<br>
away the muggers with his presence (ah, the power of a Fair Witness),<br>
and never asked me for any payment. Just anecdotal evidence, but<br>
I would be surprised if rigorous stats bore out the idea that public<br>
cops actually perform much better than your worst-case scenarios<br>
for PPAs. Of course, we don't have rigorous stats for  PPA performance<br>
yet, just theory and a little bit of real-old Icelandic and<br>
Anglo-Saxon history.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Or are protection agencies supposed to be location-based?</i><br>
<p>
In my more moderate moods, I'm a Hayekian, and impressed by the<br>
incredible tangle of externalities and public goods that develop<br>
in a complex dense large city (such as San Francisco), and I'm not<br>
all that averse to local governments contracting out for local<br>
police services. (I still don't care for zoning decrees at *all*,<br>
though.) The fact of the matter is that where I live, the problem<br>
with law enforcement is not that it hasn't been fully privatized<br>
and demonopolized, it's that they are wasting huge amounts of<br>
resources on "vice" and traffic-stuff and not concentrating on<br>
actual crime. Not to mention that the oppression of the persecution<br>
for "vice" is one of the forces that turn people toward crime. It<br>
makes the difference between a down-and-out person just turning to<br>
drugs (bad outcome in a libertarian society) and a down-and-out<br>
person turning to drugs *and* crime (bad outcome in my current<br>
society).<br>
<p>
So much for vice. As for the traffic-stuff, I think the streets and<br>
roads should be privatized.<br>
