IAN: Ironically, it's the banning of cloning that will ensure<br>
the worst possible scenarios.  The worst possible scenario is <br>
that only the State has the authority to conduct cloning, and<br>
even worse, that it does so only undercover of secrecy.<br>
<p>
That's exactly what will happen if cloning is banned. There's<br>
no way the central cabal of CIA and mega-wealthy conspirators<br>
that actually run/own the federal government are not going to <br>
exploit this science to their advantage, just as overwhelming <br>
evidence, which most people have never reviewed, confirms these <br>
very people are doing with the running of licit drugs and the<br>
defacto monoploy given to them by drug prohibitons.  <br>
<p>
Legal prohibition of cloning will be the ideal cover that will <br>
ensure the necessity for secrecy and the legal means by which <br>
to enforce a monopoly of cloning sciences for the super-mega <br>
wealthy cabal that actually owns the State.<br>
<p>
It would be logical to predict that this very class will finance<br>
the "grass roots" anti-cloning activists that will through political<br>
lobby pressure no doubt succeed in turning cloning into a secret <br>
and suppressed science available only to the "secret State."<br>
<p>
As much as I fear the possible negative outcomes of cloning,<br>
only open and free access to technology can ensure the best<br>
possible outcomes. Secrecy and suppression are the keys to<br>
tyranny and atrocity.<br>
