<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Well, yes, it is ubiquitous.  For starters, a large percentage of the US</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;population believes the Bible is *literally* true, including such patently</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ridiculous ideas as the world being created only 6,000 years ago.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is your best example.  Here one is tempted to postulate broken </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Most people think that a die is less likely to come up 6 if it has</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;come up 6's the last 3 times.  Many people think that the Social</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Security Trust fund is significant when compared with Social</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Security's debt.  Most people think that when they buy a house they're</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"building equity", when in reality 98% of what they pay goes to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;bank.  Most people believe that the greatest danger to their children</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is posed by strangers (when children are molested, kidnapped or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;killed, it's almost always friends or family).  I could go on forever</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;like this.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;These are cases where the public thinks one thing, and experts think</i><br>
<i>&gt;another.  Here it is not clear that the public knows of the expert's</i><br>
<i>&gt;opinion.  Without that, it is not an example of the phenomena at issue.</i><br>
<p>
I think it's quite germane.  The point is that most people are using "broken"<br>
cognitive thought processes (i.e. they're not acting at all like Bayesian<br>
agents) and that when they consult other people's opinion they consult other<br>
people (the public as a whole) who also are mostly not acting like Bayesian<br>
agents.  So their opinions are not well-formed, and are not good evidence.  <br>
<p>
Many of the elements I quoted involve information which is quite easy to<br>
research and which is genuinely relevant to ordinary people.  My point is<br>
that people generally do not act like good Bayesian agents in usual<br>
circumstances.  I see no reason why experts in general are any different.  My<br>
impression of scientists is that they mostly learn to be passable Bayesian<br>
agents by having their ideas repeatedly disproved until they learn to<br>
approach even plausible, compelling ideas with scepticism.  In the social<br>
sciences and humanities this school of hard knocks really only applies to a<br>
few fairly quantitative subspecialties.<br>
