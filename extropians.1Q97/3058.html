Sorry for being a little late with this (just been catching up on the<br>
cloning threads), but i don't think this was mentioned already, (unless it<br>
shifted to another thread) <br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be possible (theoretically) and maybe ethically more acceptable<br>
to: <br>
<p>
A) Make sure a clone doesn't develop a brain BEFORE fertilization, by<br>
taking out certain genes ?<br>
<p>
B) Grow just an arm or body part from specialized tissue cells ?<br>
<p>
Ofcourse growing a clone without a brain, cutting off his leg and then<br>
leaving it? alive for future spare parts would also seem very unethical.<br>
Even brainless clones should have some rights (animal rights?)<br>
<p>
Does anyone here know HR Gigers 'Bodenhaltung' (the sketch) ? Its a<br>
nightmarish vision of degraded human working conditions in order to<br>
generate 'bio-power'. Genetical modification should be used to improve, not<br>
to degrade.<br>
<p>
and about using animals for donor organs:<br>
<p>
Shouldn't i be the one left to decide what i do with my genes to my animals<br>
? (as long as i don't cause that animal to suffer) In the Netherlands a<br>
court ruled a bull had to be 'terminated' last year, because it was given a<br>
human gene (which would increase milk production i believe). In the end<br>
they just sterilized it and let it live. <br>
<p>
It would surely be good for agriculture to allow modification, and maybe<br>
then those subsidies would finally end, opening the doors for a free world<br>
market ?<br>
