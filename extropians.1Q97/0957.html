<i>&gt;&gt; Sounds a lot like Raymond Smullyan's "The Tao Is Silent".</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Note:  Raymond Smullyan also wrote "First-Order Logic".)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no doubt that Smullyan is a mystic and I don't agree with</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything in "The Tao Is Silent" but it is an absolutely wonderful</i><br>
<i>&gt; and brilliant book.</i><br>
<p>
I have to agree, and I was also surprized.  I can also recommend<br>
Alan Watts' books on Zen, the writings of Zen master Bankei, and<br>
Stephen Mitchell's translation of Tao Te Ching.<br>
<p>
I think calling Zen "mystical" misses the point.  I must admit that<br>
most of the writings on Zen are quite mystical: I think most Zen<br>
teachers and writers miss the point, too.  The experience of Tao,<br>
Buddha-mind, Satori, Bankei's Unborn, whatever it's called in the<br>
various sects, is a real and valuable experience.  A kind of mental<br>
state or discipline that excises delusions and prejudices built up<br>
in the mind by life.<br>
<p>
The reason I don't see it as mystical is that the mental state<br>
itself, whether reached by zazen practice, or sudden enlightenment,<br>
is not in itself a /means/ to anything: not to understanding, truth,<br>
happiness, fullfillment, or whatever.  As soon as you seek something<br>
like that, you've lost it.  A man with Buddha-mind who chops wood<br>
and carries water /just/ chops wood and carries water.  He can even<br>
still feel tedium or accomplishment or weariness, but his mind is not<br>
attached to them, invested in them, or deluded by competition or<br>
purpose or explanation.  Zen is no more mystical than one's fingers.<br>
<p>
Where many Zen texts miss the point is that since /attachment/ to<br>
analysis is a frequent delusion, they make the mistake of consciously<br>
fighting reason and analysis itself, rather than just doing /that/<br>
with a clear mind.  A true Zen master still needs a bucket to carry<br>
water, and still needs the tool of reason to explain the nature of<br>
reality, but he uses each just as they are.<br>
<p>
Zen has no dogma, no particular ethics, no gods, or other trappings<br>
of what we would call religion or spiritual practice.  It does have<br>
the traditions of the Buddhists who first discovered it, but one can<br>
ignore such baggage to get to the meat of it.  There is nothing truly<br>
incompatible about rational, logical, critical thinking and Zen.  In<br>
fact, I find the latter quite helpful to the former. <br>
