<i>&gt; &gt; There is some question about whether the Gnu copyleft is enforcible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but whether it is or not, it is generally obeyed.  Its restrictions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then are real in effect.  One cannot use parts of gnu software in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; your own product unless you jump through Stallman's hoops, whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you want to or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I may be missing something, but isn't this the kind of voluntary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; contractual IP protection that we've been arguing for? </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Mark</i><br>
<p>
There is a difference between a voluntary shrink-wrap license and<br>
the Gnu copyleft; in the former, your acceptance of the terms must<br>
precede your purchase, as evidenced by exchange of consideration.<br>
That makes it a contract--and offer is made, accepted, and executed.<br>
Stallman's software is free, and since no consideration is exchanged,<br>
there can be no contract.  He simply gives you information, then<br>
issues a unilateral pronouncement about how you will use it--or even<br>
what you may derive from it--whether you consent or not.  And the<br>
copyleft is (theoretically) binding even on those third parties who<br>
come in contact with the information by perfectly legitimate means<br>
without having examined any contractual terms.  It is, for example,<br>
legal for me to post source code for GCC anonymously to the net. <br>
But then anyone who downloaded that anonymous post--and thereby<br>
incurred real costs prior to examination of the contract--would be<br>
bound by the copyleft nonetheless.<br>
