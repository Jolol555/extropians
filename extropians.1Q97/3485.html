A few months ago, I came up with this idea for a new technique I like to<br>
call "Site Cloaking". It's possible to create a Perl CGI script that would<br>
grab a file or webpage from another site &amp; display it for the user without<br>
telling the user the original location like a proxy. This way you could put<br>
a CGI script on your website with links to country-specific censored texts<br>
or webpages and not tell anyone the site locations so that they can't shut<br>
them down. A person could put up a so-called subversive webpage in that<br>
specific country and tell this proxy the address and thus protect the site<br>
without giving out it's real address forcing the ISPs in that country to<br>
scan ALL WEBPAGES on their servers making the process more difficult. You<br>
could put up any so-called subversive and censored information on your<br>
webpage and people could access them without getting shutdown because only<br>
the CGI script would know where the source site is and you could even<br>
cipher the script's site list so even the owner of the proxy website can't<br>
locate the sites. You could then have a website or even a web search tool<br>
where you'd load all these sites into and acquire even more sites because<br>
you'd be offering protection and the sites would stay up indefinately. If<br>
the FEDS get pissed, simply wipe the file and the list is gone but the<br>
sites remain. <br>
<p>
A person I talked to over IRC claimed that a CGI Perl script such as this<br>
isn't all that difficult to do but I myself have zero experience in<br>
programming Perl. Perhaps someone on this list who can program in Perl can<br>
try it?<br>
