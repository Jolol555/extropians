<i>&gt; I think you need to explain this more carefully... all your explanation</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to imply is that if Java is insecure then I can write trojans which</i><br>
<i>&gt; will pass a verifier but trash your computer when run. I don't see that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; implies anything about whether or not it *is* secure. </i><br>
<p>
All right.  After this, I give up and you visit Sun's Website.<br>
1.  Java is an artificial assembly language.  The verifier is a side<br>
issue; it simply confirms that this is a Java program and not something<br>
else.  It is almost impossible (as far as I know, simply and<br>
mathematically impossible) to fool the verifier because it is an<br>
extremely simple program.<br>
2.  Java, the assembly language, simply cannot do anything bad to your<br>
computer.  It cannot crash it.  It cannot read the hard drive.  It<br>
cannot look at, or affect, programs in memory.  Period.  End of story.<br>
3.  Various standard classes give Java clearly defined holes; if these<br>
holes stack up to a large hole, this is not the fault of the Java<br>
language - it is the fault of whoever designed the standard classes.<br>
4.  If you're feeling paranoid, feel completely free to disable Java. <br>
I'd stake my hard drive on it.  There are a lot of security holes in<br>
Netscape; Java isn't one of them.<br>
