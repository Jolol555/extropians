<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Some time ago someone mentioned Jefferson's belief that each generation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  should remake its constitution and laws; Greg Burch replied that there's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  a lot of wisdom encoded in parts of the law, and it would be inefficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  to recreate that over and over.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  But we don't have to.  People can read the old laws and re-enact the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  good ones.  The point is to force a reconsideration of the old</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  structures, and in modern terms get around the public good problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  (people won't organize to get rid of a bad law that hurts them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  slightly).  Think of it as a forest fire: the useless brush and dying</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  trees are consumed, the healthy live.  Similarly the laws with strong</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  justifications would be re-enacted; dross would be pruned.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the things I like best about this group is how bright the folks are</i><br>
<i>&gt; who are attracted to extropianism and who participate on this list.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; often exhibits itself in a "convergent evolution" of memes, with people</i><br>
<i>&gt; figurng out the same truths from different angles.  Damien's "forest fire"</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggestion is a perfect example of this.  The idea of a defined end to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficacy of a law or other government function, forcing the reconsideration</i><br>
<i>&gt; of its value, is actually known in at least the theory of legislation, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfortunately not very common in practice.  It is called "sunset", in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; metaphor that really doesn't convey the worth of the idea as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Damien's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am by no means an expert on this subject, but do recall that the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "sunset" features in legislation became fashionable in the late 70s and know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that at least some governmental agencies and functions have had sunset</i><br>
<i>&gt; provisions written into their enabling legislation since then.  (I have a dim</i><br>
<i>&gt; recollection that it may have been a minor buzzword in the policy lexicon of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Carter administration and know that it gets mentioned from time to time</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Texas legislature.)  But I can't think of any fundamental legislation</i><br>
<i>&gt; (like codes governing basic commercial or social relations) or big or</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive governmental agencies that have serious sunset deadlines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Furthermore, I can't think of any correlary of the sunset principle in any</i><br>
<i>&gt; common law system of which I am aware.  Thus, for instance, in the common law</i><br>
<i>&gt; regimes with which I am familiar, a principle of law is just that until it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; affirmatively challenged and a conscious decision is made to change it.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact, the idea of a definite "lifespan" for a specific rule of law is quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; foreign to the fundamentally ad-hoc and case-specific process of developing</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal principles in the common law process.  Thus Damien's suggestion of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitutional sunset or "forest fire" amendment would in fact be necessary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a matter of legal theory and practice in our current system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
 I wonder though, giving lawmakers the opportunity once a generation to<br>
re-enact laws would possibly give them ample opportunity to add on more<br>
and more garbage, giving us a legal version of bloatware. At least once<br>
a law is passed it stays passed and can't be screwed with that much.<br>
<p>
Personally, I would go in the other direction, making  the passing of<br>
laws an irreversable act tantamount to a constitutional amendment, and<br>
requiring supermajority voting to enact. THis would force lawmakers to<br>
really mean it when they pass a law. Seems to me that most of the "good"<br>
laws or acts of congress typically pass by an overwhelming majority,<br>
while the rest that are nothing but hindrances are typically simple<br>
majority passers.<br>
