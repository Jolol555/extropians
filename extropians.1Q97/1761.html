Jim,<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; "In its efforts to conceal this reality, capitalism has become notorious</i><br>
<i>&gt; for vicious attacks and disregard of the rights of any who would expose the</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth of its actual practices. As with rape and other abuse, society's</i><br>
<i>&gt; activity can cause lasting harm to those involved, to families, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt; mankind."</i><br>
<p>
Jim, I see a problem with this analysis that hints at a deeper level that<br>
can be found behind to this problem.  The problem is that all of the evils<br>
presented here as characteristics of capitalism, are actually characteristics<br>
of predatory behavior in general.  It is a very deeply rooted problem that is<br>
much older and more general than anything specifically to do with capitalism,<br>
and a problem which we humans are not in any way exempt from.<br>
<p>
We may transcend this problem, but we will certainly no longer be human when<br>
we do so.  Are you ready to be non-human?<br>
