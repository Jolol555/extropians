<i>&gt;faster to read and comprehend.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Nonetheless, Chinese is a poor language for coding new concepts that are too<br>
far outside their existing concept set.  One of the big problems faced by<br>
many Asian countries (especially less developed ones) is that most written<br>
language is translated *through* Chinese, even if neither the original nor<br>
the end translation were in Chinese.  <br>
<p>
An example:  When books are translated from English into Vietnamese, they<br>
are first translated into Chinese (even the Vietnamese-Americans do this!).<br>
The problem is that Chinese translations force every English concept and<br>
word into their symbol set, even if it has no equivalent.  The Chinese<br>
language does poor distinction, especially when nouns are involved IMO.  The<br>
translation from Chinese into Vietnamese is easy, but the result is very<br>
poor even though the languages map onto each other pretty well.  Proper<br>
nouns are demolished.  New conceptual containers are destroyed.  "Software"<br>
becomes translated as "a soft thing" (like a pillow!) and "Frame Relay"<br>
makes no sense at all.  "Frame" and "Relay" are broken apart and translated<br>
into their more mundane definitions which apparently must make sense in<br>
Chinese.  Yet direct English-Vietnamese translations do not suffer this type<br>
of problem.  Apparently the "translate through Chinese" thing is a really<br>
big issue in Asia right now because it is putting a lot of countries at a<br>
disadvantage in technology fields.  Even most American book publishers<br>
translate through Chinese first.  I understand there is a historical reason<br>
why this is, but I don't know what it is.<br>
<p>
English may not be very efficient, organized, or pretty, but it is a superb<br>
conceptual container, mostly for the same reasons.  English descriptive<br>
containers are somewhat fuzzy, but noun-like conceptual containers are very<br>
good IMO.<br>
<p>
<p>
THOUGHT: maybe technological development is hindered/helped by the<br>
constructs/nature of your native language.  I find it possible that Chinese<br>
technological development slowed when (among other things, of course) their<br>
technology reached the limit supported by their language.  I would be very<br>
curious in knowing how the Chinese language stores the equivalent of English<br>
words/concepts such as "hydrocarbon" or "quantum mechanics".<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;(3) The vast, detailed, expressive vocabulary of English is indeed a</i><br>
<i>&gt;good thing, and works well for expressing fine distinctions that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be difficult in other languages (only French and German come close),</i><br>
<i>&gt;but it also encourages ambiguity: words created or borrowed to express</i><br>
<i>&gt;some narrow, specific idea are often diluted into more general meanings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Replica", for example, once meant "a reproduction of an artifact by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the original artisan".  Now it swims in the same soup as "copy" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;"duplicate"--it has even migrated into the territory of "model".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
An interesting feature of certain Polynesian dialects is that they have a<br>
very small set of descriptive words (adjectives, adverbs, etc) which can be<br>
given a large number of degrees of distinction by repeating the appropriate<br>
syllables in the root descriptive a certain number of times.  You can get an<br>
amazing amount of mileage out of a very small vocabulary and alphabet if you<br>
know how to use it.<br>
<p>
The diffusion of meaning in English is almost unavoidable, but is especially<br>
obvious in the American forms, which have been subject to much more diverse<br>
ethnic and cultural influences than the average language.  Naturally,<br>
languages spoken by more homogeneous groups of people tend to have a more<br>
homogeneous nature.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;English has served us adequately, but we can do much better.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular, we can try to fix the well-known identifiable problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;like sexism, unintentional ambiguity, poor adaptability to new</i><br>
<i>&gt;concepts, cultural dependencies, and others.  Whatever we create</i><br>
<i>&gt;will no doubt evolve other problems--but we'll never find our way</i><br>
<i>&gt;out of the maze until we free ourselves from the straitjacket first.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think the problems you stated regarding English, are mostly due to the<br>
fact that it evolves so easily, which in my opinion isn't such a bad thing,<br>
even if it is inconvenient.  English may allow us to "evolve" out of<br>
problems such as sexism, although things like ambiguity seem to be a more<br>
permanent feature.  <br>
<p>
To be honest, I kind of like the ambiguous nature of English.  It lets you<br>
code many levels of thought into a single phrase much easier than with more<br>
structured languages.  I have found many languages (primarily Asian ones in<br>
my experience) to be inadequate for expressing complex ideas concisely,<br>
forcing me to revert back to English for those concepts.  Some of the more<br>
limited Asian languages actually incorporate a European language into their<br>
own language when describing some complex concepts, even when spoken by natives.<br>
