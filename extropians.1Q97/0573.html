Eliezer, maybe you are missing the point.<br>
<p>
Evolution is really a reductive scientific theory. It reduces life to<br>
smaller and smaller units. For example a hierarchy of the units of life<br>
might go something like this-<br>
<p>
The organism<br>
Organs that constitute the organism<br>
Cells that make up the organs<br>
Organelles within cells<br>
Proteins<br>
Genes<br>
<p>
Dawkins and others have proposed that genes are the fundamental units of<br>
life and also<br>
that they are the units that natural selection operates on to generate<br>
complexity. We are all familiar with "The Blind Watchmaker".<br>
Now, if we take the reductionist argument further we must ask what genes<br>
are composed of. Well, DNA, and DNA consists of purines, pyrimidines,<br>
sugar, phosphate etc. All of these molecules are composed of atoms.<br>
At the atomic level, from which we must assume life arose in the first<br>
place, what are (were) the forces operating to generate complexity and<br>
what is (was)<br>
the form of selection operating on the atoms? How can it be "survival of<br>
the fittest" when we consider that, compared to living beings, atoms are<br>
virtually immortal? A block of metal is not alive but under most<br>
circumstances it can far outlive any creature.<br>
<p>
The program that you describe sounds interesting, and I'm sure that it is<br>
possible to learn a lot about evolution from simulations, but I wonder if<br>
we can learn the full story. A simulation contains a program, and I think<br>
we are still a considerable way from fully understanding the program(s) of<br>
life. I'm not suggesting I have the answers, I just<br>
wonder if we have asked all the questions. As extropians we should beware<br>
of being dogmatic.<br>

thinking we were at when we created them." <br>
