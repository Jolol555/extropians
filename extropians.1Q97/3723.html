<i>&gt;You have just defined it then. You have defined art as something to be</i><br>

<p>
I don't think TOMorrow has done any such thing. He has stated an preferred<br>
mode of use for art, but, given an object, his statement does not allow me<br>
to say whether or not TOMorrow would consider that object 'art'. Put<br>
another way: his statement does not say that everything which is created,<br>
shared or enjoyed is art; nor does it say that art is everything which is<br>
created, shared or enjoyed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This definintion corrollates directly with</i><br>
<i>&gt;my subjective definition of art: the manifestation of our pleasures, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;ignores my objective definition: that art is the status of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition.</i><br>
<p>
You have yet to provide your working definitions of subjectivity and<br>
objectivity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...the people of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;future will have even better understanding of psychology coupled with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;great deal more data to make objective corrollations with.</i><br>
<p>
There objectivity will be more objective than our objectivity. In which<br>
case our objective analysis of historic art will be surpassed by them also.<br>
We may, in fact, be getting totally wrong. This seem's to be an<br>
exceptionally shaky variety of objectivity.<br>

<i>&gt;No, not "just" as subjectively. Trained scientific professionals are</i><br>

<i>&gt;There is a major difference between interpreting artwork subjectively,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"What do I personally think or feel about this work?", and interpreting</i><br>
<i>&gt;it objectively, "How do the qualities of this work corrallate with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;collected data at my disposal?"</i><br>
<p>
To an extent I agree: they are _more_ objective. They are not, however,<br>
objective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can look up at the stars and say, "Wow those are beautiful," and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;continue to make up all kinds of astrological fairy tales about those</i><br>
<i>&gt;stars, or I can seek to become more objective in my interpretation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the stars and create a science called, astronomy.</i><br>
<p>
Why is the creation of astronomy more objective than the creation of<br>
astrology and mythology? It isn't: it's just your preconceptions which<br>
cause you to equate objectivity with post-Enlightenment rationality. This<br>
is not a valid. (Or, at the very least, not the generally accepted version<br>
of 'objectivity': the laying of stress upon what is external to the mind;<br>
the placement of the knowledge of the non-ego as prior in sequence to the<br>
knowledge of the ego.)<br>
<p>
Put another way:<br>
<p>
I flick a light switch and a light comes on. I interpret that as a flow of<br>
electricity, because I apply all my knowledge of what others have said.<br>
Someone else does the same, gets the same results, and interprets it as<br>
magic, applying all his knowledge of what others have said. We are both<br>
equally objective in our interpretations: there is no difference in the<br>
process we follow to reach our conclusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You do not have to believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;in an objective definition of art for such to exist.</i><br>
<p>
The point being, that the objective definition of anything, if an objective<br>
defintion can exist, is temporally and culturally variant.<br>
