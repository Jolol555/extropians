Probably it would be very confusing (or even epileptic). Most likely it<br>
would feel like utter chaos, where no thought or action was possible due<br>
to interference. The trouble is of course that there is no<br>
neuron-to-neuron correspondence between human brains, they are very<br>
different from each other, even in twins. <br>

Have you read Moravec's _Mind Children_? He describes in vivid detail a <br>
way to upload you destructively when conscious that does not lead to any <br>
death experience. <br>
<p>
By the way, what is so bad about experiencing death if you can be sure <br>
about being uploaded/survive? <br>

<i>&gt; Do you want your brain to become a cloud, </i><br>

<i>&gt; I do not.</i><br>
<p>
Who cares about the brain, it is the mind we don't want to disperse! You <br>
seem to identify yourself with the actual matter of your body, not its <br>
pattern; most cells are replaced in time, and atoms constantly enter and <br>
leave you. Very little of ourselves is constant. <br>
