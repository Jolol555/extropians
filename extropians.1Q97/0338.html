Well yes, but that was never the claim.<br>
<p>
I found this report last night which is quite relevant to the debate:<br>
<p>
Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns<br>
Report of a Task Force established by the Board of Scientific Affairs <br>
of the American Psychological Association (Released August 7, 1995)<br>
<a href="http://www.csra.net/lrand/APA_01.htm">http://www.csra.net/lrand/APA_01.htm</a><br>
<p>
It is mostly about "The Bell Curve" but contains this section:<br>
<p>
Sex Differences<br>
<p>
Most standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that <br>
there are no overall score differences between females and males. <br>
Some recent studies do report sex differences in IQ, but the direction <br>
is variable and the effects are small (Held, Alderton, Foley, &amp; Segall, <br>
1993; Lynn, 1994). This overall equivalence does not imply equal <br>
performance on every individual ability. While some tasks show no sex <br>
differences, there are others where small differences appear and a few <br>
where they are large and consistent. <br>
<p>
Spatial and quantitative Abilities. Large differences favoring males <br>
appear on visual-spatial tasks like mental rotation and spatio-temporal <br>
tasks like tracking a moving object through space (Law, Pellegrino, &amp; <br>
Hunt, 1993; Linn &amp; Petersen, 1985). The sex difference on mental <br>
rotation tasks is substantial: a recent meta-analysis (Masters &amp; <br>
Sanders, 1993) puts the effect size at d = 0.9. (Effect sizes are <br>
measured in standard deviation units. Here, the mean of the male <br>
distribution is nearly one standard deviation above that for females.) <br>
Males' achievement levels on movement-related and visual-spatial tests <br>
are relevant to their generally better performance in tasks that involve <br>
aiming and throwing (Jardine &amp; Martin, 1983). <br>
<p>
Some quantitative abilities also show consistent differences. Females <br>
have a clear advantage on quantitative tasks in the early years of <br>
school (Hyde, Fennema, &amp; Lamon, 1990), but this reverses sometime <br>
before puberty; males then maintain their superior performance into <br>
old age. The math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test shows a <br>
substantial advantage for males (d = 0.33 to 0.50), with many more <br>
males scoring in the highest ranges (Benbow, 1988; Halpern, 1992). <br>
Males also score consistently higher on tests of proportional and <br>
mechanical reasoning [Meehan, 1984; Stanley, Benbow, Brody, Dauber, <br>
&amp; Lupkowski, 1992). <br>
<p>
Verbal Abilities. Some verbal tasks show substantial mean differences <br>
favoring females. These include synonym generation and verbal fluency <br>
(e.g., naming words that start with a given letter), with effect <br>
sizes ranging from d = 0.5 to 1.2 (Gordon &amp; Lee, 1986; Hines, 1990). <br>
On average females score higher on college achievement tests in <br>
literature, English composition, and Spanish (Stanley, 1993) they also <br>
excel at reading and spelling Many more males than females are diagnosed <br>
with dyslexia and other reading disabilities (Sutaria, 1985), and there <br>
are many more male stutterers (Yairi &amp; Ambrose, 1992). Some memory tasks <br>
also show better performance by females, but the size (and perhaps even <br>
the direction) of the effect varies with the type of memory being <br>
assessed. <br>
<p>
Causal Factors. There are both social and biological reasons for these <br>
differences. At the social level there are both subtle and overt <br>
differences between the experiences, expectations, and gender roles of <br>
females and males. Relevant environmental differences appear soon after <br>
birth. They range from the gender-differentiated toys that children <br>
regularly receive to the expectations of adult life with which they are <br>
presented, from gender-differentiated household and leisure activities <br>
to assumptions about differences in basic ability. Models that include <br>
many of these psychosocial variables have been successful in predicting <br>
academic achievement (Eccles, 1987). <br>
<p>
Many biological variables are also relevant. One focus of current research <br>
is on differences in the sizes or shapes of particular neural structures. <br>
Numerous sexually dimorphic brain structures have now been identified, and <br>
they may well have implications for cognition. There are, for example, sex <br>
related differences in the sizes of some portions of the corpus callosum; <br>
these differences are correlated with verbal fluency (Hines, Chiu, McAdams, <br>
Bentler, &amp; Lipcamon, 1992). Recent brain imaging studies have found what <br>
may be differences in the lateralization of language (Shaywitz et al., 1995). <br>
Note that such differences in neural structure could result from differences <br>
in patterns of life experience as well as from genetically-driven mechanisms <br>
of brain development; moreover, brain development and experience may have <br>
bi-directional effects on each other. This research area is still in a <br>
largely exploratory phase. <br>
<p>
Hormonal Influences. The importance of prenatal exposure to sex hormones <br>
is well established. Hormones influence not only the developing genitalia <br>
but also the brain and certain immune system structures (Geschwind &amp; <br>
Gaiaburda, 1987; Halpern &amp; Cass, 1994). Several studies have tested <br>
individuals who were exposed to abnormally high androgen levels in utero, <br>
due to a condition known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia(CAH). Adult CAH <br>
females score significantly higher than controls on tests of spatial <br>
ability (Resnick, Berenbaum, Gottesman &amp; Bouchard, 1986); CAH girls play <br>
more with "boys' toys" and less with 'girls' toys" than controls (Berenbaum <br>
&amp; Hines, 1992). <br>
<p>
Other experimental paradigms confirm the relevance of sex hormones for <br>
performance levels in certain skills. Christiansen and Knussman (1987) <br>
found testosterone levels in normal males to be correlated positively <br>
(about .20) with some measures of spatial ability and negatively <br>
(about -.20) with some measures of verbal ability. Older males given <br>
testosterone show improved performance on visual-spatial tests (Janowsky, <br>
Oviatt, &amp; Orwoll, 1994). Many similar findings have been reported, though <br>
the effects are often non-linear and complex (Gouchie &amp; Kimura, 1991; <br>
Nyborg, 1984). It is clear that any adequate model of sex differences in <br>
cognition will have to take both biological and psychological variables <br>
(and their interactions) into account. <br>
<p>
== end quoted material ==<br>
<p>
So if de Garis defines genius narrowly to mathematical or scientific<br>
genius (which I would personally disagree with), then this report seems<br>
to support his claim to some extent. However I suspect that other factors<br>
such as social barriers to entry in scientific fields, and possible<br>
genetic predispositions away from status-seeking endeavors like<br>
academic ladder climbing have at least as much to do with the phenomenon.<br>
<p>
Interestingly (and my PC alarms are going off for even mentioning it)<br>
the report has this to say about racial differences:<br>
<p>
"The differential between the mean intelligence test scores of Blacks and <br>
Whites (about one standard deviation, although it may be diminishing) does <br>
not result from any obvious biases in test construction and administration, <br>
nor does it simply reflect differences in socio-economic status. Explanations <br>
based on factors of caste and culture may be appropriate, but so far have <br>
little direct empirical support. There is certainly no such support for a <br>
genetic interpretation. At present, no one knows what causes this<br>
differential."<br>
