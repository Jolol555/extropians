<p>
No.            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What is the monetary value of your love for your  mother?     </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't need to place a monetary value on the love I have for my mother <br>
because I can't sell it to you at any price, even if I wanted to. That <br>
doesn't mean we place an infinite value on life, we don't, not even on our <br>
own life. If we did we'd live in the cheapest one room apartment we could <br>
find and eat nothing but soybeans, powdered milk and vitamin tablets. <br>
The money saved would be used to pay for more health insurance and for <br>
emergencies.<br>
<p>
The Free market provides an index of civilization's opinion of the value of <br>
object, and that includes intangibles. Intangibles are important and they are <br>
reflected in the price. I could make more money if I change jobs and worked <br>
for a different company, but if it's an unpleasant, unfriendly place then it <br>
might not be worth it to me. If I was the CEO of that company I'd try to make<br>
the working conditions more pleasant so I wouldn't have to pay so much to get <br>
people to work for me.<br>

<i>        &gt;Tesla was working towards free energy for the masses, but then         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;monetary interests such as Eddison and the US government quickly         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ended that noise.    </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nothing is free, the only question is if the people who consume a commodity <br>
will pay for it themselves, or if they will use  force to make other people <br>
pay it for them.  As for Tesla, he was a great genius but he was also nutty <br>
as a fruitcake.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>              &gt;Employment is modern slavery.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree that work is a terrible drag, but at this stage in out Evolution <br>
there doesn't seem to be any alternative. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By defining minimum wage our puppet government is allowed to define         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;just how many people will live in poverty, spending their lives         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;enslaved to the system working 60-80 hour work weeks. I know many         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;people who work these hours and  are still barely able to make ends        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;meet. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It doesn't matter how badly you need the money, if your services are only  <br>
worth 1$ an hour to me then that is all I will pay for them, unless I'm <br>
engaged in charity. If the government decrees that I must pay everybody 5$ an <br>
hour then the solution is obvious, I won't hire anybody and now you make <br>
0$ an hour.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>          &gt;What are there, like 6 billion people in the world, and about         </i><br>
<i>          &gt;40 million who have internet access. That means that less than 1%        </i><br>
<i>          &gt;(about 0.6%) of our world population has internet access.         </i><br>
<i>          &gt;The biggest hindering factors being economic, and then political.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It is not a coincidence that the places on the Earth where Internet access is <br>
most common are also the same places where markets are the most free.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Food and rent are more important [than the Internet]   </i><br>
       <br>
<p>
If a person can not afford to buy a used computer at a garage sale, then I <br>
don't understand how they can buy a new color television and I don't  <br>
understand how they can then afford to spend hundreds of hours a month <br>
watching it.  If they can not pay 20$ a month for Internet access how can <br>
they afford to spend 10 tines that much on cigarettes and beer? <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Survival. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
In western society it has nothing to do with survival, just what luxuries you <br>
value the most. Our culture insists on keeping you alive, even if you want to <br>
die, even if you're brain dead they will try to keep your heart beating.  <br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Some things cost a hell of a lot more than they should. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you have found a way to produce something cheaper than anybody else can <br>
then do so, you'll soon be very rich.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Think about all the people working for a dollar a week [perhaps         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;exagerated, perhaps not] in third world countries just to produce         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the clothing you are wearing. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I do think about it, and it makes me happy to think that without me these <br>
dreadfully poor people would be one dollar poorer.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Is it really a matter of laziness. No. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree. Nearly everybody in third world countries works harder than I do. <br>
The basic problem is that although there is far more wealth in world than <br>
there has ever been, regardless of how you divide up the pie there is still <br>
not enough for 6 billion people to have what you or I would consider an <br>
acceptable standard of living. We need a bigger pie, and fortunately I think <br>
we will soon have one.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If we kill public education, the majority of kids are going to be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;stuck in severely poor private schools, much poorer than they would         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be with government financing. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
All theories must be consistent with the facts if they are to be viable,  <br>
let's see if the experimental data supports your theory. In the poorest slums  <br>
Socialism provides the schools, in those same slums Capitalism provides the  <br>
cars.  I ask you, which are more numerous in those slums, good cars or good<br>
schools?              <br>
<p>
Some say Anarchy won't work because it can't produce "a public good" like a <br>
dam. A public good is something beneficial, that because of it's nature, <br>
must be provided to the entire public or it can't be provided at all. <br>
Well, a true public good is almost impossible to achieve under any system, <br>
and yes, constructing a large dam, especially one that didn't make economic <br>
sense (or cents), would be more difficult under Anarchy than a dictatorship, <br>
but it's not clear how many more large dams we need. What is very clear is <br>
that we need more justice, unfortunately a good law is also a public good, <br>
and that is exactly why good laws are as rare as hen's teeth when government<br>
makes the laws.   <br>
<p>
I don't think there should be equal justice for all, then justice becomes a <br>
public good and thus nobody gets much of it. Just like everything else, <br>
if you want to maximize something, make it a commodity and sell it on the <br>
free market. A good car is not a public good, it is a private good, even if <br>
everybody doesn't have one, even if I am the only one on earth who has one, <br>
it's still a good car. The way society is currently set up, private law is <br>
not allowed so a good law is always a public good, everybody must obey <br>
exactly the same good law. That's why there are so many more good cars than <br>
good laws. This also explains why governments don't legislate themselves   <br>
out of existence, doing so would be a public good.              <br>
<p>
A public school system that could really educate people would be a public <br>
good, so would an efficient department of motor vehicles. We don't have <br>
either and for the same reason.<br>
