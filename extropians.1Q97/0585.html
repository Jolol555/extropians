SOME ADVICE:<br>
<p>
Work on *becoming* a genius , forget sexual assignment.<br>
<p>
<p>
Since "muse" and "genius" are both words that began in myth and trickled down<br>
into our current culture, I have been reading this thread with some interest,<br>
but I would like to talk about genius and forget about feminist rants or male<br>
egos.<br>
<p>
The dictionary first defines genius as a spirit or guardian assigned to a<br>
person at  birth or a tutelary deity...<br>
<p>
Then it defines it as a jinni, demon .<br>
<p>
THEN  ( get this): "particular character or essential spirit of a nation,<br>
place, age, etc"<br>
<p>
Then:<br>
"natural ability, strong disposition or inclination;innate ability (with to<br>
or for) ...  "great mental capacity and inventive abitlity, great and<br>
original creative abiltity in some art, science, etc.."<br>
<p>
Last definition:<br>
<p>
a person having such capacity or ability.<br>
<p>
THE LAST THING IT SAYS IS : "see: talent"<br>
<p>
I have a lot of dictionaries and they all follow this mode<br>
<p>
The word came from the base: 'genere'  to PRODUCE.<br>
(as in GENUS)<br>
<p>
There's only one thing I know FOR SURE about genius, and that is: you don't<br>
become one by talking, discussing, or thinking about being one. <br>
<p>
I must get back to my painting.<br>
