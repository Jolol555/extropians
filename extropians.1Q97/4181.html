Thank you George for developing this further than I was able to. With<br>
that said, I feel necessitated to start digging into this stack of books<br>
(on neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and neuropsychology) which I have<br>
bought, but have yet to read. From an initial glance over them though<br>
you would be amazed at how vaguely they deal with emotions. One book had<br>
the following to say in its "Conclusion".<br>
<p>
"I do not suggest for a moment that the material I have described is<br>
anything like the complete and final answer to these questions.<br>
Neuropsychology is still a very young science, taking its very first<br>
step, and a period of thirty years is not a very long time for the<br>
development of any science. That is why some very important chapters,<br>
such as motives, complex forms of emotions and the structure of<br>
personality are not included in this book."<br>

Inward!                                                          Onward!<br>
