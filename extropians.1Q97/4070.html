Not all that strange.  We routinely have trials in which two or more<br>
non-duplicates are put on trial together if the judge is convinced that<br>
all relevant issues are joined.  In this case, at the time of the <br>
alledged crime they were the /same/ person.  No problem there.<br>
<p>
It does get odd if they plead differently, and if one turns and<br>
testifies against the other.  This is pretty damming testimony ( "I know<br>
he did it because I was him - I mean us - back when he - I mean I - I <br>
mean we - did it." )<br>
<p>
This, in a wierd way, makes duplication a bit of a deterrent against<br>
crime - or crime a deterrent against duplication.  Suppose that you<br>
had commited a crime, and had not gotten caught, but that there was<br>
a small possibility that someday you might be found out.  You now<br>
have a strong incentive not to be duplicated because your duplicate<br>
would have an incentive to turn you in.  Sort of a prisioner's dilemma.<br>
