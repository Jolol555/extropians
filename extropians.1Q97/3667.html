<p>
This seems to imply that I made such a claim. And yet the very core of my<br>
argument was that, since interpretation is observer dependent, such<br>
sweeping claims cannot be made except as statements of intent on the part<br>
of Extropian artists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would anyone speak so broadly about "Extropian writing"?</i><br>
<p>
I'd say exactly the same things about it. In fact, my post was not intended<br>
to be limited to Extropian images.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Art, like its</i><br>

<i>&gt;doubt that anyone would seriously assert that Extropian writing must, for</i><br>

<p>
No. Nor would or have I for Extropian Art. I didn't say it must. I said it<br>
could and it does, for _some_ people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As our discussions on this list demonstrate, Extropian writings may merely</i><br>
<i>&gt;aim to amuse, or explain a point clearly, or refer to a useful resource.  So,</i><br>
<i>&gt;too, I'd think, Extropian art.</i><br>
<p>
Of course that may be its aim, but that can go wrong. One has only to think<br>
how often comments on this list which are intended as jokes are taken<br>
seriously and provoke furious debate: and that's from within an informed<br>
audience.<br>
