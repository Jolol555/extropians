Dear Ed Regis,  I enjoyed reading your article on Julian Simon in the<br>
Feb 1997 edition of WIRED magazine.  I don't agree with Julian Simons<br>
ideas.  I visited his Homepage and have an idea of where he is coming<br>
from as he labels the environmental movement a fraud by con artists.<br>
Julian Simon's perpective is anthropocentric, he really does not care<br>
for anything else in the biological community.  Perhaps this perspective<br>
is also shared by the majority of your readers so when they view the<br>
pictures presented as perceptions and realities on pages 138 and 139<br>
they can feel comfortably reassured that all is well.  Where is the<br>
logic in asserting that nukes are the equivalent of raising the national<br>
highway speed limit 0.006 mph?  The world's oceans are being fished out.<br>
 Rain forests are vanishing and temperate forests are also vanishing and<br>
being replaced by monocultures of tree farms.  Soil erosion is a major<br>
problem.  Air pollution is worse in many areas such as Phoenix, Arizona.<br>
 Valuable farm land is being paved over.  I think Mr. Simon would like<br>
to lull Americans into a comfortable indifference on these issues so<br>
that environmental regulations can be reduced or eliminated.  One not<br>
convinced.  Cyber Ed<br>
