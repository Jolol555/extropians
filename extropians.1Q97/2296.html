<p>
Again this happens in many political systems, most states are autoritarian<br>
to some degree. There are those who choose to change such a system by<br>
compromise, and there are those who get shot in the head, in these systems.<br>
I'd sooner prefer to be of the first kind, than of the second, as people<br>
who get shot in the back of the head, change nothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Counterproductive policies are present in most political systems. &gt;</i><br>

<p>

<i>&gt; &gt;'laissez faire' ideals are very high on my list of priorities, but &gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;The only sense I can make of this is that you are assuming that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the state is necessary for redressing "counterproductive policies".</i><br>
<i>&gt;But this is vague. I have no interest in redressing anyone else's</i><br>
<i>&gt;counterproductive policies, as long as they don't mess with me, my</i><br>
<i>&gt;friends, or my stuff. </i><br>
<p>
nearly everything a person x does or doesn't do, will have an effect on<br>
some person y... What do you suggest for solving problems ? I'm open for<br>
alternatives, it's just that i know none, if there are, i am sorry for my<br>
ignorance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are problems involving commons,</i><br>
<i>&gt;externalities, and public goods, and some of these are severe</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems for local governments. But nearly all such things should</i><br>
<i>&gt;be handled by local governments, yet most tax funds in my country</i><br>
<i>&gt;go to the Federal government or to fulfilling Federal government</i><br>
<i>&gt;mandates. </i><br>
<p>
Aha, so you're not an anarchist, just a separatist ? The independant state<br>
of southern California ? In our private mail we discussed your (and my)<br>
ideal for an independant chunk of rock orbiting sol, for you and your<br>
friends to build your own way of life. Does this involve cutting off<br>
relations with the rest of humanity ? I'm sorry but this makes the<br>
extropian ideal of space colonization look like a disguised form of<br>
isolationism, instead of expansion. How 'entropic' ?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you saying that if someone chooses to engage in</i><br>
<i>&gt;"counterproductivity" on their own time and with their own stuff,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the State should step in and "correct" them? Please be more</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific if this is not what you mean.</i><br>
<p>
In extreme cases yes. What is the Anarcho Capitalist view on patents for<br>
example ? I can imagine situations where ones 'ownership' of technological<br>
processes, genetic codes etc, limits free trade and the freedom of the<br>
individual, can't you ? <br>
<p>
example: person A owns sythesised Gen X, he uses it for his product M in<br>
bioindustry. Gen X can also be used to enhance certain chemical processes<br>
in the human body. Person A has no intention of making it available to a<br>
minority market of strange people who want to use it ( ;-) ). Person B, C,<br>
and D have all suggested licencing the rights, but person A, won't hear of<br>
it. <br>
<p>
I can see where people want to keep these to themselves, to create a trade<br>
monopoly. You agree that monopolies are counterproductive ? Ofcourse<br>
abandoning all patents and ownership rights on technology, would severely<br>
limit R&amp;D investement. Maybe a compromise should be found, who enforces<br>
this compromise ?  etc, etc... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Assuring that "laissez faire" ideals "keep working somehow" doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to be anything that any State that I know has been very</i><br>
<i>&gt;effective at doing. </i><br>
<p>
agreed, states have their own interests, i'm very interested in rotating<br>
democratic systems like in Athens, where no one holds his position long<br>
enough to create 'state interests'. Ofcourse qualification tests are a must<br>
:-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All that's needed is for people to refrain from</i><br>
<i>&gt;violating one another's persons and property, and the vast majority</i><br>
<i>&gt;of people do that anyway because it's how they want to be treated</i><br>
<i>&gt;by strangers.</i><br>
<p>
Ah ? I had my hopes set on becoming a career looter/pillager in such a<br>
state, and finally make some deserved use of my physical strenght &amp; body<br>
size. ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The few who do not do that anyway hardly require that</i><br>
<i>&gt;50% of the gross world product be spent on suppressing them, yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;that's how much (approximately) this planet spends on government.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with the basics, but what you're suggesting here is a governement<br>
trimmed down to only functioning on justice/ military/police levels, in<br>
fact a police state. I wonder what strange and possibly dangerous people<br>
would be leading such a state. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;it is not true that all possible political systems legitimize the use of</i><br>
violence to punish voluntary and consensual exchange.<br>
<p>
The vagueness i was refering to was the possibility of conflict between<br>
"voluntary" and "consensual". <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;but my political ideal is a new thing that has never been done</i><br>
<i>&gt;before, just as our ideal of eternal life is a new thing that has &gt;never</i><br>
been done before.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but this is an obvious example of why i refered to your replies,<br>
in the way i did, in our private mail. You're subtly suggesting here that<br>
the two are to be linked by definition. Linking your personal political<br>
convictions to extropic ideals. I hope you see my reasoning now, for the<br>
conclusion i made earlier.          <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;irony&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, such as space</i><br>
<i>&gt;migration, intelligence increase, and life extension? Why not focus</i><br>
<i>&gt;on ones that are achievable instead, like cutting taxes while</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the same time improving state-provided medical care and education?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;/irony&gt;</i><br>
<p>
&lt;rationalism&gt;<br>
realistic goals: majority of the people of earth are with you on<br>
intelligence increase, space migration, life extension.<br>
<p>
unrealistic goal: minority of people are with you on creating an agorist<br>
state. <br>
&lt;rationalism&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I thereby</i><br>
<i>&gt;feel what amounts to nearly an obligation to oppose those dangerous</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideals in argument wherever I encounter them. </i><br>
<p>
Would you put your ideals of free trade before or after your ideals of<br>
opposing other political systems ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm still not sure I understand why you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are objecting to the response I made to Jim Legg.</i><br>
<p>
as i mentioned before, people project their sense of logic and  rationality<br>
on their own political environment. Jims ideas were perfectly logical and<br>
rational to HIM. I was objecting to the lack of understanding of that, in<br>
general by replies from several people on this list. I may become a mild<br>
libertarian, after some time spent on this list, as its ideas do interest<br>
me a lot, but never, that is NEVER, will i let political ideals form an<br>
obstacle for Transhumanist cooperation and communication. Something with<br>
which not everybody on this list seems to agree. P.S. Jim has left us...   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No. I honestly believe that that the State is an atavism, a left-&gt;over, a</i><br>
self-perpetuating relic of the violence and warfare that &gt;routinely<br>
characterized early Middle-Eastern civilization.<br>
<p>
&lt;irony&gt;<br>
I'll remind you of that, when i come to conquer your planet with my space<br>
fleet. And make the people on my planet happy, by giving them your planets<br>
resources, causing them to elect me for another four years.  <br>
&lt;irony&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Furthermore, I think it is the political structure of this planet that</i><br>
<i>&gt;consitutes the single greatest barrier to transhumanist goals. I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;place a higher priority on political goals than on transhumanist goals,</i><br>
<i>&gt;instead, my sense of urgency about my political goals stems directly</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the fact that in my opinion implementing my political goals will</i><br>
<i>&gt;directly and immediately contribute to my chances of success in</i><br>
<i>&gt;implementing my transhumanist goals.</i><br>
<p>
HA !, this is excactly what Jim Legg was trying to make you see, only he<br>
had a different approach. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Someone must oppose that majority and raise that awareness. Where &gt;does it</i><br>
start? <br>
<p>
true, i just hope you appreciate people who have the same (transhumanist)<br>
goals, but different routes (maybe faster ones?) to acchieve those goals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course it is based on their personal financial improvement. If &gt;enough</i><br>
people got *sincere* about being interested in their personal &gt;financial<br>
improvement they might study a little microeconomics and &gt;then it would<br>
become quite obvious to them how the politicians are &gt;robbing them blind.<br>
<p>
And the other half would find that they would be payed far less, have far<br>
fewer benefits etc, and we'd have a civil war on our hands.<br>
