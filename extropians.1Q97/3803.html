<i>&gt; It would be great if you could offer a model or some evidence/background</i><br>
<i>&gt; to back up these  facts.</i><br>
<p>
Not sure what you mean by "model", but facts I can give you (after dinner).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Not.  If you breach a contract you have Contract remedies available to</i><br>
<i>&gt; you, not those from tort law.  Fraud is enforceable in Tort.</i><br>
<p>
Caught me.  Been a while since I read up on contract law.  I believe<br>
the term is "equitable relief"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Good point, but you still havn't expressed how IP would be protected</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise.  </i><br>
<p>
I have many times, here and elsewhere, but I will again.  After dinner,<br>
I promise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What?  You're way off buddy.  Real property is protected in an identical</i><br>
<i>&gt; fashion.  Deeds are your claim to a piece of real property - granted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government.  Patents/copyrights are your claim/title to a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt; IP.  Where's the distinction?</i><br>
<p>
As a libertarian, I reject the idea that property is a whim of the state,<br>
but rather we may freely choose whatever private means of enforcing our<br>
claim to our property we find satisfactory.  But even if we do give that<br>
privelege to the state, there is a fundamental, inescapable objective<br>
difference between physical property and IP: physical property /cannot/<br>
be used to serve the ends of two people at the same time.  IP can be.<br>
A copy of knowledge is exactly the same as the original.  I do not lose<br>
knowledge when I give it to you.  If I don't want you to use knowledge<br>
to compete with me, I should keep my mouth shut, not give it and then<br>
shackle your use of it.<br>
<p>
If I plant an apple tree on my land, and sell the apples, you cannot<br>
simultaneously use the same land to plant wheat, or sell my apples for<br>
your benefit.  But If I freely choose to sell you a book on how to grow<br>
apples, never asking you to enter into any contract with me, then you<br>
/can/ use the knowledge of how to grow apples to grow them on your own<br>
land and sell them, or tell your neighbors how to grow them, without<br>
interfering one bit on /my/ ability to do the same.<br>
<p>
You may say, though, that it would be OK to grow apples, or even tell<br>
my neighbor how, but not to copy my book word for word and sell it.<br>
Why not?  I am growing the same apples as you, competing with you for<br>
the limited apple market, and you have no claim on the state to protect<br>
your monopoly on apples; why claim a monopoly on your apple-book?  You<br>
could instead have asked me to sign a contract waiving my right to grow<br>
apples and sell them into your market, and you could have asked me to<br>
sign a similar contract not to give the apple knowledge away, but you<br>
didn't.  I shouldn't use force to prevent you from using a asset I chose<br>
to give you of my own free will.  If I don't want you using my knowledge<br>
to compete with me, it is /my/ obligation, not the state's, to make<br>
that happen by non-coercive means.<br>
