What Jim Legg doesn't understand is that money is a communications<br>
medium.  And it's a far more *honest* communications medium than<br>
talk. If the human population of Gaia functions like a big brain<br>
(and I don't think it does: people are not neurons), *most* of the<br>
computational information flow is in the price signals. If you<br>
destroy that, then you can kiss your Overmind goodbye.<br>
<p>
Goddamn constructivist-rationalists are always running around<br>
thinking that individual cells should decide how a metazoan's body<br>
is to be run.<br>
