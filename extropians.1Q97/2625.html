Gregory,<br>
<p>
I think you are absolutely on the right lines with 'emotional intelligence',<br>
if there is such a thing (and I think there is).<br>
<p>
It is definitely true that there's a kind of art or technology out there,<br>
perhaps not quite yet fully developed, but getting there, of  listening<br>
to our emotions, and letting them say what they have to say.<br>
<p>
But no marks for your anti-violence stuff.  Reilly wasn't glorifying or<br>
rationalising vlolence, but the defensive use of force.  You like to be<br>
pragmatic, but it is distinctly unpragmatic to roll over and play dead.<br>
<p>
<p>
