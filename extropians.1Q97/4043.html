Reminds me of a humorous sf story I read a few years back where an <br>
amoeboid alien escaped punishment this way (it was guilty of selling <br>
pornographic pictures to earthly biologists who used them to illustrate <br>
mitosis in their textbooks). Both the resulting individuals claimed <br>
innocence, and pointed out that they were underage. <br>

In a more serious vein (?), I think that in a society where you can copy<br>
yourself (most likely among infomorphs like uploads) guilt and property<br>
will have to be redefined a bit. My suggestion is that when you copy<br>
yourself, your possessions should be divided equitably between the copies<br>
(it might be possible to "testament" property in more complex<br>
arrangements, or for the copies to pool their resources into a collective<br>
if they want) and social contracts such as marriage would be<br>
re-negotiated. All copies would be equally responsible for the actions in<br>
their shared past, so all should be punished for such crimes. <br>
