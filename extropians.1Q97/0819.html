Eric Watt Forste:<br>
<i>&gt;Lee Daniel Crocker asserts that "You shouldn't offend people" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;"People can be hurt by words" are dangerous memes. This position seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-contradictory to me.  Are not these two ideas mere ideas, mere</i><br>
<i>&gt;strings of words? If they are false, as Mr. Crocker seems to think they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are, then people cannot be hurt by words or ideas. </i><br>
<p>
I have come to think that transhumanists, once and for all, need to <br>
decide the role of words and language in future scenarios.  If we are <br>
planning to operate in symbolic environments like the internet, <br>
uploading, and other computer applications, then words themselves are <br>
going to become our physical representations.  It therefore becomes <br>
specious to debate terminology and definitions on the one hand, <br>
thereby acknowledging the impact of words as symbolic <br>
representations, and to simultaneously dismiss the potential of <br>
language to inflict pain on an individual.<br>
