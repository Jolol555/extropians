 No it isn't. It's his reality, it's my reality, and it's the reality of more<br>
 than half of the european youth today. Many elements of which will be<br>
 continued in mainstream culture for the next decades. Get used to it.<br>

I think you may have misinterpreted my objection, I am *used* to everyone<br>
doing lots of drugs, that is nothing new to me. What I am not in agreement<br>
with is that everyone HAS to do them in order to have enhanced senses. Since<br>
you snipped away the context, it will do no good to say what I was objecting<br>
to but here it is:<br>
<p>
Colorblindness is a condition that we have yet to find a cure for. Drug use<br>
is completely voluntary. If someone is colorblind, we do not condemn them and<br>
say YOU CANNOT ENJOY a van Gogh, that would be cruel. It is denying them<br>
their reality. You can't tell them whether they get it or not, or that your<br>
"color" way is better...<br>
<p>
I am sorry to see you angry words  "get used to it". It was not my intent to<br>
disrespect you or suggest you stop doing X.<br>
Yes, of course underground makes its way into mainstream, it always has, but<br>
that is not anything new either.<br>
<p>
Anyway, If you follow his logic, everyone who saw Van Gogh should be<br>
suicidal, psychotic, and we would need  absynth alcohol, in order to REALLy<br>
understand what he was saying.<br>
