Neuroscientist Theodore Berger is working real hard to be the first person <br>
to implant microchips between your ears.<br>
<p>
During the past four years, Berger and a seven-member team of scientists - <br>
experts in everything from semiconductors to the neurophysiology of tissue <br>
cultures - have worked ceaselessly at the University of Southern California <br>
in Los Angeles to unlock the brain's complex mathematical model so they can <br>
bridge the gap between silicon and cerebrum. "If we can speak to the brain <br>
in its own language then we begin to understand the biological basis of <br>
thought and learning," says the 46-year-old scientist. "It's a matter of <br>
understanding the way neurons act and react in every conceivable situation, <br>
then building a device that can duplicate their basic functions and <br>
transmit the appropriate electrical impulses."<br>
