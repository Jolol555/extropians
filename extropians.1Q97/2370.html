I really like this analysis! It also fits in well with Max's doctoral <br>
thesis on personal identity. <br>

Yes. (Have you read Kaufmann's CRITIQUE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY?<br>
It's great. Now I'm trying to find a copy of his FAITH OF A HERETIC.)<br>
I can't reconcile the notion of life having a preprovided meaning<br>
with the notion of freedom. We are free to the extent that we get<br>
to choose what to do... if the universe had specific plans for us,<br>
and could tell us about those specific plans in unambiguous terms<br>
(for instance, a philosophical proof), then it would be silly to<br>
claim that we choose what to do.<br>
<p>
I don't think Eliezer's Powers are going to waste much time trying to<br>
determine the Meaning of Life, because I think they will probably prefer<br>
freedom.<br>
