          LIBERTARIAN WRITER TRASHED FOR OPPOSITION<br>
<p>
                TO VIOLENCE AGAINST HEMP USERS<br>
<p>
    And The Establishment-wide Crackdown on TWA 800 Inquiry<br>
<p>
<p>
   by Ian Williams Goddard<br>
<p>
   In a crude and pathetic example of yellow journalism, the <br>
   Long Island newspaper NEWSDAY (03/14) [1], in an effort to <br>
   smear independent TWA 800 crash researchers on the Internet, <br>
   used Ian Goddard's principled libertarian opposition to the <br>
   initiation of force -- i.e., violence -- against nonviolent <br>
   hemp users [2] as a pretext for condemnation and counter <br>
   argumentation against TWA 800 Navy-missile theorists. <br>
<p>
   What is more, as NEWSDAY makes all too clear, a Navy missile <br>
   could not have hit TWA 800 because Ian Goddard's webpage links <br>
   to a webpage that links to a webpage that shows, God forbid, a <br>
   woman's "bare derrierre." So much for his crash-damage analysis.<br>
   I even hear he posts his nude sketches on his art webpage, and <br>
   to think I thought military zone W-105 was activated... oh well.<br>
<p>
   The mind boggles at the depths to which the major media will <br>
   sink to defend the Military Industrial State that most clearly <br>
   killed 230 people off Long Island on July 17th, 1996. The NEWSDAY<br>
   smear job by Geoff Mohan &lt;mohan@newsday.com&gt; is only one example. <br>
<p>
   The entire major media is uniformly assaulting TWA 800 researchers. <br>
   See my rebuttal of the 60 MINUTES smear job on my TWA 800 research: <br>

<p>
   It's time to shutdown this Goddard with all his wrong thinking. <br>
   Most of my fellow researchers who believe the Navy shot-down TWA<br>
   800 have been hit-on by the FBI, had their property seized, and <br>
   we have all been hit with an avalanche of mass-media disinforma-<br>
   tion. It's no secret: as pro-FBI CNN (3/12/97) [3] reports:<br>
 <br>
           The FBI this week launched a criminal <br>
           investigation, hoping to stop missile <br>
           theorists. <br>
<p>
   There it is folks: the use of law to stop wrong theory, to stop<br>
   wrong thinking.  This is a for-real, all-out Establishment-wide <br>
   totalitarian crackdown on the few souls with the guts to question <br>
   the so-called "investigation" by federal authorities into the crash <br>
   of TWA 800. The FBI wants to extricate "wrong thought" from society.  <br>
   Right after the FBI seized Richard Russell's evidence, his two Inter-<br>
   net connections, each on a different server, where cut for 24 hours<br>
   as the media slandered him on national TV, surrounded his home, and <br>
   even entered his property disguised as maintenance workers. I wish<br>
   the media would investigate the government with the same zeal and <br>
   ferocity that it investigates those who question the government.<br>
<p>
<p>
   TOP-SECRET GRAND JURY<br>
<p>
   As widely reported, a grand jury on the TWA 800 case has been <br>
   convened and no one in the press knows what the legal basis is <br>
   for this top-secret grand jury, particularly since the FBI says <br>
   there is  NO EVIDENCE  of any criminality in the TWA 800 crash. <br>
   But what we do know, is that all the secret-grand-jury does is <br>
   intimidate and terrorize independent TWA 800 researchers.  My <br>
   friends tell me it's likely the FBI will also target me with<br>
   some type of "legal" force in order to shut me up. Indeed:<br>
  <br>
   Legal action may be activated to force me and others to remove <br>
   from our websites the photograph of a cruise missile off Long <br>
   Island on the night TWA 800 was hit with another missile. This <br>
   photograph is proof that there were live-missile tests off <br>
   Long Island that evening in the activated military zones.<br>
  <br>
   See it while you can: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dir.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dir.htm</a><br>
<p>
   Once the photograph of the missile is suppressed, the FBI will<br>
   indeed be able to say: "There is no evidence of  Navy-missile<br>
   activity that evening." The manufacture of reality by brute <br>
   force -- a shocking aggression against the entire nation,<br>
   against human freedom, and against the truth.<br>
