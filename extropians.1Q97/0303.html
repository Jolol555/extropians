In re Guru George's request for historical references:  I think that the <br>
best books about female humans who influenced history are yet to come, <br>
because of the increased number of female historians completing their <br>
degrees and moving into positions that will enable them to research and <br>
publish books. <br>
<p>
That having been said, I found a reference to a book that sounds <br>
really interesting:  _Hypatia's Heritage:  A History of Women in <br>
Science from Antiquity to the Late 19th Century_ by Margaret Alic, <br>
The Women's Press, London  1986.<br>
<p>
There is a new book out (heard a radio interview with the author <br>
but her name escapes me) about the women in Caius Caesar's life.  <br>
Apparantly he was attracted to highly intelligent females and <br>
thought Cleopatra had a sexy brain.<br>
<p>
Riane Eisler compiled a lot of scattered historical references into _The <br>
Chalice and the Blade_, but her focus is more sociological.  <br>
<p>
I find myself often referring to _Womanwords_ by Jane Mills, in which <br>
she traces the historical entymology of all words relating to women.  <br>
(Words listed relating to intelligent women:  bluestocking, governess, <br>
midwife, spinster, witch)<br>
<p>
