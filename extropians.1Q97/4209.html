<i>&gt;Remote outposts like Iceland were able to hold out for several</i><br>

<i>&gt;on the Continent where there is greater exposure to invasion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and more dependence on fixed agriculture.</i><br>
<p>
This implies that centralization in fact does do better at providing<br>
public goods such as defense.  So future hope would have to be based<br>
on changing this somehow by inventing better decentralized<br>
institutions, or on less need for public goods in the future.<br>

<i>&gt;vulnerably fixed, dependent on geographical jurisdictions to solve</i><br>
<i>&gt;their defense problems.  With our transportation and communications</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies, our mode of production of itself no longer stands in</i><br>

<i>&gt;giving way to mobile capital, with political  institutions adapting at </i><br>
<i>&gt;their typical excruciatingly slow pace.</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  New high tech includes lots of relatively fixed capital.  If<br>
silicon valley were invaded today, do you think all the workers there<br>
could carry away most of the local capital on their backs, and start<br>
up anew somewhere else together without suffering much harm?  <br>
