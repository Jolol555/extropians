I would only like to add to the anti-cryptography sentiment here that<br>
the financial systems of the world today rely largely on trust, rather<br>
than force or secrecy.  I think this is a bit dangerous (totalitarian<br>
governments may be able to track the financing of a revoloution) but it<br>
makes poeple rely on and trust each other in order to live, which is<br>
probably good for us.<br>
<p>
It is a well known saw that when goods and money cross boarders, armies<br>
are much less likely to;  we probably gain peace on many interpersonal<br>
levels from the necessity of trust, just as we gain peace<br>
internationally through contracts and trade.<br>
