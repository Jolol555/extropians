<i>&gt; Oh the emperor is declothed, and he is a theif. You say,"then I use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas". That right there is your crime. Then inventor has gone through</i><br>
<i>&gt; enormous expense in terms of research and development and you have gone</i><br>
<i>&gt; and stolen the benefits of that investment without proper compensation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this case, sir, YOU ARE A THEIF!.</i><br>
<p>
Because you have defined me as such, sir.  The idea that an author or<br>
inventor deserves monopoly control over the use of his creations to<br>
ensure his just earnings from them is so ingrained in our culture that<br>
it takes some effort to fight it.  But that idea is a recent one, is<br>
not universal to all cultures even today, is not the original intent<br>
of the laws that now enforce it, and is simply not supported by the<br>
facts as I see them.  I am unswayed by argument-by-definition.  If<br>
you want to simply take the "inventions are property" meme as an axiom,<br>
I am powerless to argue against it /is your axiomatic system/.  But if<br>
you could, even for a moment, step outside of your mindset, ignore<br>
the arbitrary definitions this culture has put into your brain, and <br>
look at the inescapable objective reality that ideas and bread are<br>
fundamentally different, then we can have a rational discourse about<br>
whether it makes sense to apply bread-property law to ideas.  Until<br>
then, it is pointless for me to continue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You cite works of art and inventions developed prior to over 95% of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventions in human history. That the present system has encouraged the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other 95% in as short a time as the last century indicates that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; present system is more conducive to technological advancement.</i><br>
<p>
Again you confuse "issued patent" with "invention".  Most of the useful<br>
inventions of mankind were made /before/ patents.  They are things like<br>
language, writing, fire, housing, agriculture, cooking, weapons, cloth,<br>
tools, and the millions of other inventions we take for granted.  And<br>
each of those inventions raised the level of technology of society so<br>
that further invention becomes faster, making it seem like everything<br>
that comes to mind when we say "invention" is recent, but that's just<br>
because our minds have supressed the background noise of things we've<br>
grown accustomed to.  I will not speculate on how much faster things<br>
might have advanced without patents in the way, because that would be<br>
just pure speculation; but it is also pure speculation to claim that<br>
progress would have been slower without them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What's the /objectively definable/ difference between discovering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; inverse-square law of gravity and the LZW compression algorithm, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; natural order spreadsheet recalculation, or a process for making soap,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all of which are patented?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The law of gravity is merely a discovery of knowledge of the existing</i><br>
<i>&gt; structure of the universe, while the others are artifical constructs</i><br>
<i>&gt; created by the human mind. That there is the difference between a</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery and an invention. </i><br>
<p>
But isn't the fact that if I add lye to lard in a certain way, it<br>
produces soap just a discovery of the inherent already-existing<br>
properties of lye and lard?  I can use my knowledge of the inverse-<br>
square law to fire a cannon more accurately, and I can use my knowledge<br>
of the soap process to clean myself more effectively.  I honestly<br>
don't see an objective difference to justify the fact that any old<br>
grenadier can use Newton's discovery for his own profit, but not the<br>
discovery of the soap process issued US Pat #1.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An invention which earns a patent not only is something actually new</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the sun, but also of high enough market value to be worth the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort of pursuing the patent process. As for your circular claim, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is no such thing in my argument.</i><br>
<p>
The circularity is this: you claimed that patented inventions added X<br>
dollars of value to the economy, and therefore patenting inventions<br>
was valuable.  Let's imagine, for example, that instead of passing a<br>
patent law, congress had passed a law mandating that all inventions<br>
must be green.  Given the same numbers, your argument becomes, "green<br>
inventions have added X dollars of value to the economy, therefore<br>
making inventions green is valuable."  <br>
<p>
Inventions do indeed have an objective economic value.  The argument<br>
is not what value X may have resulted from patents; the argument is<br>
about the value of the economy, Y, that would have resulted from the<br>
absence of patent law during that same period.  You contend that X &gt; Y.<br>
I contend that Y &gt; X.  Both are speculation, because we can't do that<br>
experiment.  So we're stuck arguing with the data that does exist,<br>
and from reasonable extrapolations from it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ah you show that you do not understand the economics of it. First off,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "fair use" has been declared legal, as is personal use, which is why you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can make as many copies as you want, so long as you gain no commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfaction from them.</i><br>
<p>
It's your understandiing that's faulty here.  Lack of commerical use is<br>
absolutely no defense.  The Supreme Court ruled (Sony vs. Universal<br>
Studios) that /one/ copy made by a VCR for time-shifting is "fair use",<br>
but that's all.  If you tape a game, and show your friends, you are<br>
absolutely violating the law, and the copyright owner of the broadcast<br>
can prosecute you.  Of course, they won't as a practical matter<br>
because it would be impossible.  Such absurdities of existing law are<br>
hardly arguments for continuing it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, Joe was paid on contract for his services. The organization which</i><br>
<i>&gt; invested in his services have taken a risk, which they value in current</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars at a discounted rate from future earnings. Joe didn't take the</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk, the company investors did, so they are who earns the downstream</i><br>
<i>&gt; royalties from the broadcast. Just as you, who did a great job</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing your compression algorithms, were under contract to Piclab,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or who ever, and were being paid a salary or fee to do the work "for</i><br>
<i>&gt; hire". your employers made the investment in you to develop the</i><br>
<i>&gt; algorithms. If you had done it all by yourself, you could enjoy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefits of that invention. Unfortunately, you are like many corporate</i><br>
<i>&gt; writers, inventors, etc., in that you fall into an individual version of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the trap Benjamin Franklin described: "That nation which shall sacrifice</i><br>
<i>&gt; some measure of freedom for greater security shall wind up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; neither." Because you seek a secure position, you shy away from the role</i><br>
<i>&gt; of entrepreneur, you wind up giving up your rights to benefit from your</i><br>
<i>&gt; creations.</i><br>
<p>
I understand all that, and agree.  But the fact that they made the<br>
business decision to charge a certain price for advertisements on the<br>
broadcast, basing that decision on the present existence of copyright<br>
law, is not argument that the economics you relate so well would fail<br>
to operate just as well if the assumptions were different.  Perhaps<br>
the network would charge more knowing that they can't expect royalties<br>
from others once they've chosen to broadcast it.  Please believe that<br>
I absolutely understand how the present system works; I am a part of<br>
it.  I'm just not stuck in it.  I have a vision of something better,<br>
and solid reasons for it.<br>

<i>&gt; Nice vow of poverty, Reverend. This is, IMHO, not a statement of free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market principle, but of anti-market sentiment veiled as piety.</i><br>
<p>
I earn quite a nice living, thank you.  If by "piety" you mean adherence<br>
to my own philosophy in general, not necessarily religious ones, then<br>
yes that's exactly what it is.  Putting my money where my mouth is.  I<br>
honestly believe this view will make us all /more/ profit in the long<br>
run, and even the not-so-long run.  If I didn't, I wouldn't do it.<br>
If you want to prove me wrong, you'll have to come up with better ideas<br>
than I've seen so far.<br>
