I hate to say it, but to me you seem to be recreating the transputer; a<br>
standalone chip with fast task-switching, limited memory protection (at<br>
least for the T9000) and messaging built into the hardware (or SRAM in the<br>
CPU in your case). <br>

True... but your processor is presumably going to have its own on-chip<br>
cache? So just make it 12k larger to make room for the nanokernel. If you<br>
have seperate SRAM you're still going to need extra hardware for the<br>
address decoding. The speed should be identical to on-chip SRAM; that's<br>
why the T9000 design had this capability. The earlier chips had on-chip<br>
SRAM for performance reasons (instant access rather than six cycles to get<br>
data from DRAM), and because embedded applications could run with just a <br>
ROM and transputer, solely using internal RAM.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; T9000 is mythical, anyway.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I went to the official launch about five years ago and it wasn't<br>
ready (pretty bizarre), but I remember reading Usenet articles from people<br>
who had some. Not that it would be very competitive today anyway.<br>
