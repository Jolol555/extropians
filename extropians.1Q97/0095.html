I must apologize for allowing my emotional reaction to some of the<br>
postings here interfere with the effective communication of the point<br>
I was trying to argue.  It began with a claim that "medicine is not<br>
science", to which I took issue, explaining the scientific foundation<br>
of medicine.  Others then took issue with some of the aspects of<br>
modern medicine as practiced in the US (with which I agreed), and<br>
promoted alternatives (with which I do not agree).<br>
<p>
The assertion I have been trying, but failing, to make, is just this:<br>
The fundamental nature of most modern allopathic medicine is science,<br>
and the fundamental nature of most "alternative" medicine is quackery.<br>
I stand by that basic assessment, and I will try to explain.<br>
<p>
It is always dangerous to generalize about people.  One cannot begin<br>
every sentence with "I'm sure there are a few counterexamples, but the<br>
majority of group X, or the primary founders/directors/speakers of<br>
group X, or most members of group X I have met..."  So it is important<br>
to identify what defines the group, what gives it its identity.  Then<br>
one can draw conclusions about the group from its nature, without<br>
having to rely on individual examples that can be too variable.<br>
<p>
The nature of allopathic medicine is science.  Doctors collect and<br>
share data about diseases, perform experiments with treatments and<br>
diagnoses, encourage others to verify their results, publish articles<br>
in peer-reviewed and refereed journals, submit themselves to public<br>
criticism of their ideas, postulate new ideas and other explanations<br>
for their results, change their recommendations with new data, and<br>
willingly admit their ignorance when insufficient data are available.<br>
There are some things that get in the way: the expensive FDA approval<br>
process discourages less-profitable medicines.  The AMA cares more<br>
about the health of its members' bank accounts than patients.  But<br>
these problems are well known, many are working to fix them and<br>
others, but the nature of the business is still the same: when facts<br>
slap them in the face, they eventually listen.  Because despite the<br>
bureacratic obstacles and mental prejudices, the methods themselves<br>
are scientifically sound, and the epistemology used to update the<br>
methods is sound.<br>
<p>
The nature of most alternative medicines is mysticism.  Authorities<br>
are revered over results--the older the authority, the better.  Pretty<br>
but unobservable ideas like the acupuncturist's flow of "chi" and the<br>
sub-molecular "vibrations" of the homeopath are espoused despite<br>
centuries of lack of evidence, and the inability to measure or test.<br>
They write books and sell them in popular bookstores without submitting<br>
them for review.  They sell supplements in health food stores with<br>
lots of personal recommendations, anecdotes, analogies, and other<br>
flawed reasoning as sales techniques.  They appear on talk shows to<br>
promote their wares and to ridicule--perhaps appropriatley--some part<br>
of modern medicine, hoping that the audience with thereby think that<br>
any alternative is superior.  They claim to cure everything, and to<br>
have "fundamental" knowlege.  When science proves them wrong, they<br>
simply incorporate some part of it into their mythology in an attempt<br>
to keep it alive, the way chiropractors finally capitulated on the<br>
germ theory of medicine when they no longer had any choice.<br>
<p>
Again, these are generalizations, but every time I go into a health food<br>
store and read glowing endorsements on a label, or turn on Oprah and<br>
hear some quack telling us not to immunize our children, and a doctor<br>
on the panel quietly acknowleging when asked that "yes, science doesn't<br>
know everything"--as if that were a negative--the nature of the two<br>
businesses are confirmed in my mind.<br>
<p>
The choice to employ a specific method of reasoning has consequences.<br>
And since life and death depend on the consequences of medical advice<br>
and treatment, that choice is far more important than irrelevant factors<br>
like the practitioner's personality or motives, licensing authorities,<br>
professional affiliations, the esthetic qualities of the arguments, or<br>
one's personal prejudices.<br>
<p>
Since all organic diseases sometimes cure themselves, and the mind has<br>
powerful effects on the body, anything one does will cure some people.<br>
But the methods of science can isolate those cases from the results of<br>
real treatments.  A child with a ruptured spleen can choose either the<br>
scientifically verified method of surgery, or the older authoritative<br>
method of prayer.  There are no guarantees either way, but odds are he<br>
will survive in the first case and die in the second.  A woman with<br>
headaches may well find comfort and ease of pain with acupuncture.  But<br>
if they were caused by a brain tumor, her delay in seeking reponsible<br>
diagnosis could kill her.<br>
<p>
Because actions have consequences, the people who take those actions<br>
are responsible for them, and may properly be judged for their choices.<br>
In the absence of other information, I judge a modern doctor to be a<br>
scientist, and I judge an alternative practitioner to be a charlatan,<br>
even when the acupuncturist happens to make the pain go away, and the<br>
doctor loses a patient on the table.  Until the fundamental nature of<br>
those occupations and their methods of reasoning change, I will<br>
continue to do so.<br>
