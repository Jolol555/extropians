Perhaps this is because we are not economically ready for a space<br>
program.  Government can certainly accelerate development in some areas,<br>
but at what cost elsewhere?  The Soviets launched the first satellite;<br>
perhaps because doing so was too expensive for anyone private to do for<br>
fun, and business couldn't see the profit.<br>
<p>
Spaceflight is still bloody expensive, although avoiding any form of<br>
nuclear motor wouldn't help.  Lucian[1] yearned for the moon and stars as<br>
we do -- perhaps the sad fact is that we are not yet rich enough to<br>
leave.<br>
<p>
Hmmph.  If any private initiative had been able to go to the Moon, would<br>
it have let the effort sputter out the way Apollo did?<br>

... The Anarchists' [national] anthem is an international anthem that<br>
consists of 365 raspberries blown in very quick succession to the tune<br>
of "Camptown Races".  Nobody has to stand up for it, nobody has to<br>
listen to it, and, even better, nobody has to play it.<br>
