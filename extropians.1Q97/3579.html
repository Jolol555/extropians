 				Order a headstone: The browser died on Wednesday. <br>
<p>
It was the victim of two new standards proposed that day. Two new<br>
standards<br>
that create new ways to receive channels of information over the<br>
Internet. Standards that pave the way for push broadcast to dominate.<br>
And<br>
browsing to fade away. Of course, browsing will always be around as an<br>
option. Just like you have the option to traipse out each morning to buy<br>
a newspaper. <br>
<p>
The old Internet was based on pull, which entailed searching for<br>
something<br>
useful. But with 2 million different URLs out there, it's too ridiculous<br>
to have<br>
to hunt for what you want. The new Internet is based on push, or direct<br>
delivery. Pull is what we did because we weren't smart enough to figure<br>
out<br>
push yet. Just like in the early days of the telephone network. Back<br>
then,<br>
human operators manually plugged cables into switchboards, until we were<br>
smart enough to figure out automatic switching. (Of course, you can<br>
still get<br>
an operator. You just don't need to very often.) <br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong. People won't be pushing anything your way without<br>
your permission. You'll be subscribing to what you want, be it news,<br>
sports,<br>
weather, Web site updates, whatever you fancy. <br>
<p>
In brief, here's what killed the browser. Microsoft proposed a way for<br>
any<br>
channel—any push broadcaster—to plug into Internet Explorer 4.0 (which<br>
is<br>
due out this summer). At the same time, PointCast proposed to open its<br>
popular broadcast system to any Web site. You can get the details in the<br>
stories linked at the side. By the way, Netscape is expected to follow<br>
soon<br>
with a proposal of its own. <br>
<p>
But the main thing you need to understand now are the implications: <br>
<p>
Netscape will have to respond or its browser will fall out of favor in a<br>
hurry. The impending conflict is likely to make it more and more<br>
difficult for Navigator users to receive broadcasts from publishers<br>
using Microsoft's approach (and vice versa). <br>
<p>
Content will be king, dethroning technology. At last, we will be able<br>
to make information-gathering decisions based on content (and<br>
maybe some minor features)—rather than whose technology works<br>
better. Which means the Internet will be a true new medium. <br>
<p>
It's time to start thinking about how you're going to push your Web<br>
site. If you choose to do it on your own, you need to investigate the<br>
proposals from Microsoft and PointCast. And if you choose to<br>
partner, you have to be very careful. Because most of the 30-some<br>
odd push vendors will be out of business in a year or two. <br>
<p>
When all is said and done, you can expect to see three major standards.<br>
One from Microsoft. One from PointCast. And one from Netscape. Does this<br>
remind you of anything? How about the three television networks that<br>
arose<br>
in the 1950s? The Internet is right where TV was back then: on the verge<br>
of<br>
becoming the next major medium. <br>
<p>
All we're waiting for now is the Internet equivalent of Milton Berle.<br>
Berle<br>
hosted the television show that galvanized America in 1957. Convinced<br>
millions it was finally time to bring home a TV set. And firmly planted<br>
a<br>
headstone atop that medium's skeptics.<br>
