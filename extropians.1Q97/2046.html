<i>&gt;I want a list of All necessary nutients,</i><br>
<i>&gt;thier Optimal dosage,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and most efficient method of administration</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the purpose of longevity.</i><br>
<p>
The Life Extension Foundation states (at <a href="http://www.lef.org/subjects/diet.htm">http://www.lef.org/subjects/diet.htm</a>)<br>
that "[the] ideal diet for health and longevity is a low-calorie, low-fat, <br>
low-salt, diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain foods and <br>
high-fiber foods." Not quite as specific as you requested, but I don't<br>
think anyone knows how to optimize diet for longevity yet.<br>
<p>
[Curt Adams]<br>
<i>&gt; If you're really serious about longevity, try calorie restriction.  Even that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not yet provem to work in people, although it has worked in any animal</i><br>
<i>&gt; model short-lived and cheap enough to test.</i><br>
<p>
Beware starting calorie restriction too young or too quickly. I wish<br>
I had an authoritative source for this, but the CR FAQ makes no such<br>
warning. All I can say is that in my own notes on calorie restriction <br>
(<a href="http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/extro/lifex.html#cr">http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/extro/lifex.html#cr</a>) I've recorded<br>
several comments to this effect - most likely picked up from<br>
sci.life-extension. One even went so far as to say, "Don't start<br>
until you're 45."<br>
