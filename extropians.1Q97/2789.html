Some legitimate questions have been raised here that deserve a<br>
more thourough treatment than Rand's dogmatic dismissals and<br>
Friedman's silent avoidance.  In particular, how do we resolve<br>
radical individualist ethics with human compassion and certain<br>
apparently positive aspects of altruism?<br>
<p>
Two-person relationships like romantic or filial love can be<br>
treated as mutual agreements, and are pretty easy to fit into <br>
individualist ethics.  Love is a contract.  Relationships are<br>
a value to both involved, or they are unstable and destructive.<br>
The more interesting question is that of selfless altruism.<br>
<p>
First I recognize that there are drives in human nature that<br>
predispose me to certain altruistic practices, whether I rationally<br>
judge them moral or not.  If it were my son in danger, I would<br>
risk considerable danger to myself to rescue him, without question.<br>
But I also know /why/ those drives are there, which has nothing to<br>
do with my rational moral choices: evolution.  Genes that caused<br>
fathers to rescue their sons prospered, because those sons were<br>
the gene's mode of travel to the next generation.  Other altruistic<br>
behaviors not kin-linked can also evolve based on reciprocity.<br>
Birds and apes that groom each other suffer fewer parasites than<br>
those that don't, and so are more successful.  But there are also<br>
evolutionary drives of the same sort that predispose me to kill<br>
my stepchildren and cheat on my wife.  I therefore reject human<br>
nature, as shaped by evolutionary forces we understand pretty well,<br>
as a valid source for moral behavior.<br>
<p>
There is a second reason to do so, even with altruistic behavoirs.<br>
That is the fact that evolutionarily stable strategies are rarely<br>
optimal strategies.  The prisoners' dilemma is a classic example.<br>
Even iterated encounters will generally settle into strategies that<br>
are less exploitable, but sub-optimal.<br>
<p>
Humans have an advantage over other beings: we can change the rules<br>
of the game.  We can jump outside the system.  With imagination and<br>
free will, we can find other strategies that we weren't born with,<br>
and practice them, and teach them.<br>
<p>
Even if I reject human nature as a source of moral guidance, I might<br>
still accept its existence as a fact in determining personal values.<br>
That is, even if I reject basing my actions upon emotional desires,<br>
I might recognize that they make certain things valuable to me, and<br>
I will act rationally to obtain those values.  This offers us no help<br>
in determining what those rational actions might be, so it is still<br>
rather unsatisfying.<br>
<p>
There is, I think, a better way to look at certain acts of unilateral<br>
altruism as a positive self-interest, and that is simply to recognize<br>
that interaction with others fills the vast majority of your time on<br>
this planet, and one cannot practically pre-negotiate contracts with<br>
every other human you might meet, it makes sense to create /principles/<br>
of behavior that facilitate everyone's smooth interaction with others.<br>
Non-violence is the most obvious such principle, and a good one.  It<br>
serves to maximize the potential of the use of the mind, by removing<br>
from the equation a major restraint.  A mind under compulsion is not<br>
a mind at all; it cannot reason and choose freely. <br>
<p>
But that alone is not sufficient for positively altruistic behaviors<br>
to arise.  Benevolence can still be rational for several reasons: (1)<br>
since you obtain most of your values by trade with others, assisting a<br>
stranger in some way at a small cost to yourself may benefit you in<br>
the amount of that stranger's potential value to you at a later time.<br>
(2) Even with no direct benefit to you, that stranger may be a value<br>
to others, who will then be of more value to you.  (3) Even if there<br>
were no potential benefit to you personally, the /principle/ of<br>
benevolence benefits you when generally practiced, just like the<br>
principle of non-violence.<br>
<p>
Benevolence and non-violence are probably not evolutionarily stable<br>
strategies, in that they are susceptible to exploitation.  But they<br>
are probably optimal strategies, and as humans we can change the rules<br>
of the game--structure society--so that they become standards that<br>
win out by pure numbers, or are held stable by institutions designed<br>
to maintain them.<br>
<p>
That still leaves a few situations that might make some individualists<br>
uncomfortable.  For one, what is the value to you of more than small<br>
risk in the service of others, i.e., heroism?  Is a volunteer fire<br>
fighter rationally moral?  For another, why do we judge as immoral or<br>
callous one who simply refrains from a benevolent act, even one of<br>
little risk, when we must assume he is as good a judge of the risks<br>
and rewards to himself as we are?<br>
<p>
I must admit that I can find no rational motive for either of these<br>
reactions, despite the fact that I feel them too.  I admire volunteer<br>
firemen, but I cannot judge their actions as rationally moral by the<br>
standards I choose.  I must judge them self-sacrificing altruists,<br>
because fire protection is a service that the market is capable of<br>
prividing for pay, and providing it that way is likely to lead to more<br>
advances of human potential.  I look with scorn at the teenager who<br>
does not give his train seat to an elderly woman; but I can find no<br>
rational justification for this feeling either.  I must simply resort<br>
to feeling the way I feel, and try not to act on that.  It would be<br>
unreasonable to simply assume that it is moral to do so, and then<br>
stretch for a reason--that's creationist reasoning.  I must chalk it<br>
up for now as a quirk of human nature, until I can find some other<br>
rational explanation.<br>
