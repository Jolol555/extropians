I often hear such statements, but never really understand what is meant here.<br>
Do you mean just that PCs had not been being sold until they were sold for<br>
the first time?  That seems apparent...  Or that people had no need for<br>
what PCs<br>
could do until they had a chance to buy them?  This doesn't seem true - people<br>
wanted to type, count and play for quite a while before that.  Or that<br>
people had<br>
to be explained what PCs could do?  This explanation precedes every purchase<br>
of anything...<br>
<p>
  So what does it mean, to create a market where there wasn't any?<br>
