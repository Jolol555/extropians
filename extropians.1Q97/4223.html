Vegan is but one diet among many and certainly not the last word in life<br>
extension.<br>
Joyriding in personal Airplanes sounds fine to me, the risks may for some<br>
individuals outweigh the joy of it, for others life is for living it to the<br>
hilt, otherwise why do it.<br>
Uploading and Offworld exploration is a primary  goal of many transhumanists<br>
and Extropians. <br>
Smart Drugs and Drug Addiction are two different topics, even recreational<br>
drug use is accepted in many lifestyles causing little or no harm.<br>
Scifi movies have nothing to do with this discussion, but let people enjoy<br>
them and nitpick, bad techno memes are worth debunking.<br>
<p>
You sound preachy. <br>
Thanks for sharing.<br>
