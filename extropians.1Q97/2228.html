<i>&gt; &gt; I have been a lifelong nature lover.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Welcome to the List!  I think you may be pleasantly surprised at the extent</i><br>
<i>&gt; to which transhumanists in general and extropians in particular are</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensitized to the scientific, social and aesthetic issues of our relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt; to nature.  As long-time ExList denizens know, this is one of my key</i><br>
<i>&gt; interests in extropianism.</i><br>
<p>
There are exceptions: I love Katherine Hepburn's quote from _The African<br>
Queen_: "Nature, Mr. Alnutt, is what we are put on this Earth to rise<br>
above."  Nature is ruthless, cruel, unforgiving.  I want to do better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To me these are _very_ important and apt questions for extropians and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanist community.  They cause us to look at our core values and at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific technologies we choose to use to augment our power in -- and over --</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature.  As I've written before, I find Anders' "complexity ethic" to be near</i><br>
<i>&gt; the starting point for a definition of extropian attitudes toward nature.  As</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that was intriguing, but I think unnecessary.  I think self-interest--<br>
which is of course interest in the survival of a specific complex form--<br>
is sufficient to result in valuing biodiversity in general, because the<br>
latter serves us in many ways.  Education, medicine, entertainment, wealth,<br>
and other human values depend heavily upon it.  I, too, think that the<br>
search for an extropian ethic is valuable, indeed the most valuable thing<br>
we can do, because human ethics will affect the future more than any other<br>
single factor (technology does nothing until it is employed by persons with<br>
free will, according to their ethics).<br>
<p>
Here's another try at a possible extropian ethical foundation:<br>
<p>
(1) Since it is not possible to reach normative conclusions from<br>
  descriptive premises, I must begin by postulating a normative<br>
  value, and seeing what logically follows from that value combined<br>
  with a description of reality.  I describe many assumptions of<br>
  reality below which I firmly believe are reducible to experience,<br>
  but I elide full arguments for each for brevity; I welcome<br>
  challenges to any of them.  I postulate one value: my own<br>
  consciousness, and its continuation.  This is a rational value<br>
  now because immortality is conceivably possible now.<br>
<p>
(2) The continuation of my consciousness requires expenditure of<br>
  resources.<br>
<p>
(3) Resources are finite.  Ultimately, conservation of mass-energy<br>
  is the only limit, but until technology is sufficient to exploit<br>
  all energy present, resources are limited by our technology.<br>
  Competition for resources is therefore inevitable.<br>
<p>
(4) Our own complexity is finite.  It is unlikely that any one<br>
  individual will be able to either discover every means of finding<br>
  resources to use, or of physically using them.  Therefore, non-<br>
  omniscient being must specialize in exploiting those resources to<br>
  which they are best suited.  <br>
<p>
(5) Intelligence is the primary survival mechanism of my species--<br>
  our specialty.<br>
<p>
(6) Evolution--the mathematical consequence of reproduction, mutation,<br>
  and selection--is inevitable.  At any time /t/ in history, the existing<br>
  complex mechanisms are those that (a) survived from time /t-1/, or (b)<br>
  are created at time /t/, by reproduction by those alive at time /t-1/.<br>
  That selection is inevitable is a consequence of (3).<br>
<p>
(7) Other complex forms will evolve to continue themselves and use<br>
  resources at my expense if they can.  To ensure the continuation of<br>
  my consciousness, therefore, it is in my interest to learn as much<br>
  as I can about the nature of such systems, and to create technologies<br>
  that successfully defend against them.  Because of (5), this is the<br>
  course of action most likely to lead to my goal.<br>
<p>
(8) The diversity of such systems serves my education and discovery by<br>
  showing me more ways to use resources, and by showing me how my own<br>
  body has evolved, which is necessary for me to understand how to<br>
  preserve my consciousness (my body being its current home).<br>
<p>
(9) The maintenance of diversity in the face of scarce resources<br>
  requires that resources be allocated as efficiently as possible,<br>
  subject to the constraint that my own consciousness must be<br>
  preserved.  The system best suited for that (which can be argued<br>
  seperately) is the system of property rights and free trade.<br>
<p>
(10) Free trade requires freedom of action, and benevolence.  Any<br>
  act of force reduces the diversity of actions by constraining a<br>
  free actor to the will of the initiator of force, thereby taking<br>
  away the victim's ability to use his owm mind to best advantage.<br>
  Since we have placed one's own consciousness as the supreme value,<br>
  from which the value of diversity was derived, self-defense can<br>
  justify force, but not greed or whim.<br>
<p>
Therefore, it is not necessary to postulate the value of "nature"<br>
or "freedom" or "benevolence"; merely postulating immortality as a<br>
goal can lead to those values.<br>
