<i>&gt; &gt; When we're discussing the nature of political possibility, I think the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; highly educated or popular people, but the millions and billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people who have had their little inputs into society.  When, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; example, you advocate anarchist solutions, you are saying that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; societies, for all of human history, have been making the same mistake</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of having government.  That's a very strong claim.  Can you pit your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; logic and experience against the thought and experience of billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I can.  Reality is not a matter of consensus.  It exists the way it</i><br>
<i>&gt; does regardless of what 5 billion people think.  If one man has a clearer</i><br>
<i>&gt; vision of some facet of it, and he can demonstrate it, the masses have</i><br>
<i>&gt; no choice but to abandon their mistaken consensus, or it is they who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrational.  The existence of governments is a powerful consensus, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is hard to fight, because it is hard to do controlled empirical</i><br>
<i>&gt; research on the hearts of the multitude.  But it is not impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; observe and draw some reasonable conclusions, and to attack some bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas and revisionist history.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And once you have, can you convince those people that you're not nuts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; begin with?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's not easy sometimes, because the definition of "nuts" is usually</i><br>
<i>&gt; by consensus rather than objective criteria.  But it is necessary to try.</i><br>
<p>
My sentiments exactly. SOrry for the waste of bandwidth, but I couldn't<br>
help responding to this. Using the definition shrinks have that insanity<br>
is a view of reality that differs from the majority, todays insanity is<br>
tomorrows conventional wisdom, just as if one were to beleive in<br>
evolution in the 1800's one was considered to be nuts, or at least a<br>
tool of the devil, or both, yet today it is creationists that look like<br>
the nut cases (depending on how "nuts" you yourself are).<br>
<p>
I tend to ignore people when they say that such and so is a crazy idea,<br>
or that person is crazy. It tends to make me want to check it out more,<br>
because of my own experience, those that according to mundanes seem to<br>
be nuts tend to be rather prescient in the end.<br>
