<i>&gt;  Control is a critical factor.</i><br>

<p>
I think you are missing the point here. The other brain would think it <br>
was you and that you wasn't it since it didn't control your actions. <br>
There would simply be two of you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They evolve in the environment from differing perspectives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I could predict it's actions quite well from empathy</i><br>
<i>&gt; but to say that makes it me is difficult to believe.</i><br>
<p>
So, who would it be? I think it is important to distinguish between <br>
you as your current conscious thread and you as a person with certain <br>
memories, personality and goals. The copies after forking would be <br>
different threads of consciousness but would be the same person (we need <br>
a better terminology here, I hope my sentence made sense). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If destructive scanning techniques were used it may ruin my brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My consciousness may consist of vaporized atoms.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly likely. Consciousness seems to be very linked with the integrity <br>
of the brain (or information processing system, for infomorphs)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe the brain is not as important as I thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Could I still be me without a brain?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Parden me while I get thrown for a loop.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is an important question. I define myself to be what I do (I <br>
see myself as a mapping A acting on the universe), so to me what kind of <br>
brain I have doesn't matter. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How far have I come when I do not willingly accept simple answers </i><br>
<i>&gt; to the most basic question?</i><br>
<p>
Very far.<br>
