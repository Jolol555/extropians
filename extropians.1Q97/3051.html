Joost de Lyser states:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;'Foucaults histories of madness set out to demonstrate that madness was a</i><br>
<i>&gt;social desease, whose nature changed in different periods, but which always</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflected the need for society to find outsiders to punish and imprison, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;order that the prison of the social order should seem like freedom.'</i><br>
<p>
Foucault offered new concepts that challenged people's assumptions about<br>
prisons, the police, insurance, care of the mentally ill, gay rights, and<br>
welfare.<br>
<p>
Also, he offered new concepts for, ideas, creative concept and systems of<br>
thought.<br>
<p>
Foucault was influenced by Nietzsche.  He explored shifting pattern of<br>
thinking, especially relating to power and self will.=20<br>
<p>
To further this, I'll quote:<br>
<p>
"Foucault's thinking developed through three stages. First, in Madness and<br>
Civilization (1960), he traced how, in the Western world, madness=97which=<br>
 was<br>
once thought to be divinely inspired=97came to be thought of as mental<br>
illness. In this book he attempted to expose the creative force of madness<br>
that Western societies have traditionally repressed. In his second stage he<br>
produced The Order of Things (1966), one of his most important works.<br>
<p>
"Foucault's last period was inaugurated by the publication of Discipline and<br>
Punish in 1975. It ostensibly questions whether imprisonment is a more<br>
humane punishment than torture, but it is more generally concerned with the<br>
way society orders individuals by training their bodies; for example, basic<br>
training may discipline and prepare a person to be a soldier. Foucault's<br>
last three books=97History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction (1976),=<br>
 The<br>
Use of Pleasure (1984), and The Care of the Self (1984)=97are parts of an<br>
unfinished history of sexuality. In these books, Foucault follows the stages<br>
by which people in Western societies have come to understand themselves as<br>
sexual beings, and relates the sexual self-concept to the moral and ethical<br>
life of the individual.<br>
<p>
"In all the books of his last period Foucault seeks to show that Western<br>
society has developed a new kind of power he calls bio-power=97that is, a=<br>
 new<br>
system of control that traditional concepts of authority are unable to<br>
understand and criticize. Rather than being repressive, this new power<br>
enhances life.=20<br>
<p>
I'm not an expert on Foucault, however I appreciate his use of logic in<br>
creative thinking.  Ideas, creative concepts and systems of thought.<br>
Extropic thinking?<br>
