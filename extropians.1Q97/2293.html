If you asked me a year ago, I would completely have agreed with you. But <br>
now I have been taking up exercise, and have noted an increase in <br>
alertness and efficiency. I no longer see any conflict between mental <br>
ability and physical ability, it is mainly a matter of correct time <br>
management (and if I can get my hands on a good wearable system, I will <br>
make them overlap even more). <br>

<p>
Sunlight promotes synthesis of vitamin D and lowers daytime levels of <br>
melatonin (= you become more awake and positive). Having plenty of <br>
melanine probably protects you from melanomas, which is a good thing.<br>
<p>
Of course, sunlight might not be as essential for you if you live at <br>
southern latitudes as it is for us swedes, who have a distinct lack of it <br>
during winter (and seems to have built up a psychological dependency on <br>
it in the summer). <br>

<p>
Don't be so sure... the more I become a moravecian platonic materialist, <br>
the more convinced I become that it is quite possible to escape the universe.<br>
