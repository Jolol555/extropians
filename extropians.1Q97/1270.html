I have to agree with Michael here; which brings us back to the<br>
issue that we may well have a deeply rooted genetic predisposition<br>
to "blindness and loss of objectivity" on subjects which arouse<br>
political passions.<br>
<p>
Considering that behavior is considered to evolve quicker than<br>
morphology, and that human language goes back from 50-200+ Ky<br>
(according to who you ask) I see little reason to doubt that<br>
something like this is going on (especially when one considers<br>
the abundant evidence for such blindness in the historical record).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a little broader perspective, the silence on this very issue</i><br>
in the midst of a heated argument covering the subject of "political<br>
correctness" from a number of angles could even perhaps be taken as<br>
further evidence of this type of selective blindness.<br>
