Assuming the capability to, as Hal puts it,<br>
<p>
&lt;directly perceive the innards of another person's mind.  You see what <br>
he sees, follow his thoughts, feel what it is like to be him.&gt;<br>
<p>
the question is, what happens to your own historical sensations, <br>
memories and feelings while this mind link is occurring?<br>
<p>
If they are somehow completely disconnected, how would you remember <br>
the experience once you were no longer linked?  Or, if you still had <br>
access to your own thought processes during the link then wouldn't <br>
those act as a filter for those of the other person, so that you would <br>
never really be directly experiencing what it is like to be them?<br>
<p>
(Perhaps Anders could answer this since he seems to have experience <br>
with sub-personalities (; )<br>
<p>
But, seriously, the ability to _integrate_ multiple sources of <br>
'experience' would definitely be needed by an upload with multiple <br>
robot bodies wandering around the world, and even by someone who is <br>
just 'jacked into' cyberspace and receiving simultaneous inputs from <br>
many sources on the Net, let alone a direct mind-link to another <br>
person.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we'd need to more fully develop some sort of mental or <br>
augmented-reality /whiteboard/ capability to effectively handle this.<br>
