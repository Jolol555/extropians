In Norway, we are in the process of spending billions of kroner on forcing<br>
all six-year-olds into school. Social democrats have always wanted the state<br>
to raise the children, and that is the only reason for doing this. They even<br>
half admit this, in making the extra year largely like kindergarten. There<br>
is virtually no opposition to this reform, the only complaint being insufficient<br>
funding (decreasing the quality of the whole school system). Before school,<br>
the ideal is to attend public preschools, and those who choose otherwise are<br>
sanctioned economically. In preschool and school we are indoctrinated with<br>
the holy principles of social democracy and environmentalism.<br>
<p>
As to health care, public spending on it has not declined in Norway, but some<br>
more private clinics have come into being. But those few who can afford to pay<br>
instead of waiting for years in the public system, are being looked down on and<br>
considered unsolidaric. One newspaper compared private clinics to prostitution;<br>
"We know they are there but we can't do much about it." But the fact is that<br>
the few private hospitals offer a narrow range of procedures, and you are very<br>
unlikely to have any money left for them after taxes.<br>
<p>
The national budget has a surplus of many billions because of the oil, and<br>
these are being saved to ensure pensions in the future. The man in the<br>
street would rather send this money to Third World countries than reducing<br>
taxes, in fact, tax reduction would not even cross his mind and is not an<br>
issue at all. One should think that when the government collects more money<br>
than it uses, at least some of the people would reason that it then collects<br>
too much, but this is apparently too hard for someone raised as a social<br>
democrat.<br>
<p>
I don't see much privatization, but private companies are allowed to compete<br>
with the former monopolies to a greater extent, who then fight back. For<br>
example, when a commercial national TV station finally was allowed, the<br>
public broadcasting created a second channel and is going to raise the TV<br>
tax (a tax for *owning* a TV set). Until 1992 there was only one TV channel<br>
available to everyone, and it has been controlled by the Labor Party and has<br>
been instrumental in normalizing the population as social democrats.<br>
<p>
Now the big discussion is whether stores should finally be allowed to be open<br>
on Sundays.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have always been thought that a more Socialist Europe was necessary in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cold war era, to suppress revolutionary elements, being so close to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;communist states, regionally.</i><br>
<p>
I have never heard this, and wouldn't think it a very good argument.<br>
Anyway, the "revolutionary elements" from the '60s and '70s are now the<br>
ones in power, and their ideals have IMO been implemented, democratically.<br>
If we had had a revolution, and a real communist system for a while, the<br>
future might now have looked brighter. People do get dissatisfied under<br>
communism, and then we could overturn it and introduce anarcho-capitalism.<br>
NO ONE disagrees with social democracy, so it will never go away.<br>
<p>
However, I'm not going to stick around and be pathetic. I will emigrate<br>
to the US ASAP. In the worst case I will have to go to college here<br>
first, though, since it is free.<br>
