There has been several pyramid scheme scandals in Eastern Europe since the<br>
fall of the wall, I seem to remember a situation in Romania quite similar<br>
to Albania a few years back. Pyramid schemes thrive in a situation where<br>
people want money but don't understand economics, and outside forces do<br>
not step in. The eastern european pyramid schemes does not appear to be<br>
that much a free market phenomena, rather a result of the alliance between<br>
organized crime and the old rulers, which in many cases were quite<br>
involved in the schemes (If you can't rule them, you could at least take<br>
their money). <br>
<p>
Overall, the unrest would have happened sooner or later, it needed some <br>
igniting spark. The interesting question we should ask is what igniting <br>
sparks that cause unrest in *our* societies...<br>
