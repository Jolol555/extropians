What I like about this answer that it uses many mediums and each one has an<br>
expansive "feel" or view, I am curious about music and images - looking for<br>
things to listen to to help me paint (Yes, and still I love to paint) - awile<br>
ago there was a thread about images that one sees while listening to music,<br>
this is important because there's  a certain "feel" that I want to get in my<br>
art, that I seem to experience in certain songs. It is what is commonly<br>
refferred to as "driving" music, a beat thing partially, but also mood.<br>
<p>
What corresponds more to visual images, neat? Pattern? Harmony?<br>
<p>
I see harmony as the color part...<br>
