In a message dated 97-01-08 21:00:43 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; If we hung imagination on a wall with one of those, one of those, you<br>
know,<br>
 "things" that we used to use to hang artefacts on walls, (oh what are they<br>
 called.)<br>
 <br>
 You know, those things that hold up the cardboard or similar material placed<br>
 around a picture to serve as contract, along with that outer structure made<br>
 up of parts fitted and joined together at the 90 degree corners, along with<br>
 a piece of glass or plexiglas that is inserted on top and fitted just so to<br>
 protect the artefact and ensure that it would hang just - perfectly.  <br>
 <br>
 Anyway ... one of those things that you could hammer into the wall to hang<br>
 the artefact ... But, how could we make sure that it stayed there.  I mean,<br>
 right there where we hung it?  What if it wandered off?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
if we hung the imagination, what would we hang it by? It's neck? It's<br>
toenails?<br>
