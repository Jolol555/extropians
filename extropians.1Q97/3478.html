Is Kevlar similar to polymers such as cellulose, proteins and silk, or those<br>
synthesized in laboratories and sold commercially, such as plastics and<br>
synthetic fibers?  What I like about polymers is that they consist of up to<br>
millions of repeated linked units, each a relatively light and simple molecule.<br>
<p>
I was just reading briefly about Baekeland's synthetic shellac plastic<br>
material is made from formaldehyde and phenol.  (Sounds like my old printing<br>
press - toxic -)  What I find interesting is that Bakelite products were<br>
used initially for electrical insulation.<br>
<p>
But with polymers we are getting into the "rubber" concept, which I would<br>
rather steer clear of.  First, it is over done, second it looks cheap, and<br>
third its passe'. I'm more interested in what is possible and what serves a<br>
multiple-purpose:  functionality, design and bio-tech.  Especially as<br>
prosthetics become more and more a part of our physiology.<br>
