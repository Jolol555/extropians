<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Isn't Bell's inequality derived correctly from QM as we know it?</i><br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;Yes, a totally correct result of orthodox theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If Bell's inequality was derived from Quantum Mechanics then modern Physics</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be in big trouble because Bell's Inequality is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
You are correct.  It is the violation of Bell's inequality that is derived from<br>
orthodox QM.  I should be more precise in my writings.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If took over 20 years for somebody to convincingly perform the very difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiment that Bell suggested, but when they did, Bell's inequality was</i><br>
<i>&gt; violated. This does not prove that Quantum Mechanics is the last word on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject, but it does prove that all local hidden variable theories are wrong.</i><br>
<p>
It proves no such thing if microcausality is temporally bidirectional, which<br>
is what relativistically correct quantum mechanics tells us anyway.  We really<br>
can't keep ignoring that second order differential equation with respect to<br>
time that is necessary for any relativistically correct formulation of QM.<br>
