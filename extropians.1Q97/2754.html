The free market doesn't solve anything.  Lots of people working on<br>
problems for fun and profit solve things.  Think of it as a messy<br>
parallel computer, like the proposals to use Java and the Web as a<br>
fly-by-click supercomputer; or as a massive anthill.  Each node and ant<br>
still should be doing work.  The motivation to do work is the profit<br>
received by the individual.  You think about the future to plan your own<br>
life -- since the market issues no guarantee to solve _your_ problems<br>
-- and to find future problems to solve and profit from.  (Or cause and<br>
profit from solving, to not be too idealistic.)<br>
