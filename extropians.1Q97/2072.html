3. Sensorimotor coordination<br>
<p>
Let me begin by suggesting that vertically connected laminar structures<br>
are one of evolution's simplest solutions to a crucial type of problem,<br>
one that any sensorimotor system beyond the most rudimentary must<br>
somehow solve. In order to appreciate this type of problem, let us<br>
consider a schematic creature of a deliberately contrived simplicity.<br>

             Figure 2<br>
<p>
Figure 2b is a plan view of a crab-like schematic creature (2a) with<br>
two rotatable eyes and an extendable arm. If this equipment is to be<br>
useful to the crab, the crab must embody some functional relationship<br>
between its eye-angle pairs when an edible object is triangulated, and<br>
its subsequent shoulder and elbow angles, so that the arm can assume a<br>
position that makes contact with the edible target. Crudely, it must be<br>
able to to grasp what it sees, wherever the seen object lies.<br>
<p>
We can characterize the required arm/eye relationship as follows. First<br>
of all, let us represent the input (the pair of eye angles) by a point<br>
in a two-dimensional sensory-system coordinate space or state space<br>
(figure 3a). The output (the pair of arm angles) can also be represented<br>
by an appropriate point in a separate two-dimensional motor state space<br>
(figure 3a).<br>

      sensory state space              motor state space<br>
<p>
We now need a function ot take us from any point in the sensory state<br>
space to a suitable point in the motor state space, a function that will<br>
coordinate arm-position with eye-position in the manner described. (I here<br>
sketch the deduction of the relevant functions so that its origin will not<br>
be a mystery, but the reader may leap past the algebra without any loss of<br>
comprehension. The only point to remember is that we are deducing a suitable<br>
function to take us from eye configurations to arm configurations.)<br>
<p>
The two eye angles (a,b) determine two lines that intersect at the seen<br>
object. The coordinates (a,b) of that point (in real) space are given by<br>
<p>
    a = -4(tan \alpha + tan \beta)/(tan \alpha - tan \beta)<br>
    b = -8(tan \alpha * tan \beta)/(tan \alpha - tan \beta)<br>
<p>
The tip of the arm must make contact with this point. Assuming that both<br>
the forearm and upper arm have a fixed length of seven units, the elbow<br>
will therefore have to lie at the intersection of two circles of radius<br>
seven units: one centered at (a,b), and the other centered at (0,0) where<br>
the upper arm projects from the crab's body. Solving for the relevant<br>
intersection, the real-space elbow coordinates (x_e, y_e) are given by<br>
<p>
   x_e = ((49-((a^2+b^2)^2/4b^2)*(1-((a^2/b^2)/<br>
         ((a^2/b^2)+?))))^0.5+(((a/b)*((a^2+b^2)/2b))/<br>
         ((a^2/b^2)+1)^0.5))/((a^2/b^2)+1)^0.5<br>
   y_e = (49-x_e^2)^0.5<br>
<p>
The three points in real space, (a,b), (x_e,y_e), (0,0), determine the<br>
position of the arm, whose upper arm and forearm angles (theta, psi) are<br>
finally given by<br>
<p>
   theta = tan^-1(y_e/x_e)<br>
   psi   = 180-(\theta-tan^-1((b-y_e)/(a-x_e)))<br>
<p>
These are the desired coordinates of the arm in motor state space. The<br>
reader will note that the assembled functions that yield them are rather<br>
tangled ones.<br>
<p>
Tangled or not, the crab is drawn on the computer screen, such that its<br>
final arm-position (drawn by the computer as output) is the specified<br>
function of its eye-positions (entered by us as input), it it constitutes<br>
a very effective and well-behaved sensorimotor system, especially if we<br>
write the controlling program as follows.<br>
<p>
Let the program hold the crab's arm folded against its chest (at \theta=0,<br>
\psi=180), until some suitable stimulus registers on the fovea of<br>
both eyes. The arm is then moved from its initial state-space position<br>
(0 deg, 180 deg), along a straight line in motor statet space, to its<br>
computed target position in motor state space. This is the state-space<br>
position at which in real space, the tip of the arm contacts the<br>
triangulation point of the eyes. This arrangement produces a superficially<br>
realistic system that reaches unerringly for whatever it sees, anywhere<br>
within reach of its arm (figure 4a-c). [ several multiple-frame computer<br>
renderings of the crab reaching for target omitted ]<br>
<p>
The algebraic presentation of the crab's sensorimotor transformation,<br>
as represented in the six equations listed earlier, supplies no intuitive<br>
conception of its overall nature. A geometrical presentation is much more<br>
revealing. Let us therefore consider the projection of the active portion<br>
of the crab's sensory state space (figure 5a) into the orthogonal grid of<br>
its motor state space (figure 5b), as imposed by the function under<br>
discussion. That is to say, for _every_ point in the displayed sensory grid,<br>
we have plotted the corresponding arm-position within the motor grid.<br>
<p>
Here we can see at a glance the distortion of the vertical and the<br>
horizontal lines of the sensory space, as projected into motor space. The<br>
topological features of the sensory space are preserved, but its metrical<br>
properties are not. What we see is a systematic transformation of <br>
coordinates. (The heavy scored triangle and rectangle are drawn in solely <br>
to help the reader locate corresponding positions in the deformed and the <br>
undeformed grids. Note also that the left border or \beta-axis of figure <br>
5a shrinks to the lef radial point in figure 5b, and that the top border <br>
of figure 5a shrinks to the right radial point in figure 5b.)<br>
<p>
4 Coordinate tranformation: its physical implementation.<br>
<p>
The tranformation described above sustains effective and realistic<br>
sensorimotor behaviour. But how could a real nervous system possibly<br>
compute such a complex coordinate tranformation? It is not realistic<br>
to expect it to compute this complex trigonometric function step by<br>
step, as our computer simulation does. Nevertheless, given their<br>
sophisticated sensorimotor coordination, biological systems somehow<br>
must be computing transformations like these, and others more complex<br>
still. How might they do it?<br>
<p>
Figure 5 suggests a surprisingly simple means. If we suppose that the<br>
crab contains internal representations of both its sensory state space,<br>
and its motor state space, then the following arrangement will effect<br>
the desired tranformation. Let the crab's sensory state space be<br>
represented by a physical grid of signal-carrying fibres, a grid that<br>
is metrically deformed in real space in just the way displayed in figure<br>
5b. Let its motor state space be represented by a second grid of fibres,<br>
in undeformed orthogonal array. Position the first grid over the second,<br>
and let them be connected by a large number of short vertical fibres,<br>
extending from coordinate intersections in the sensory grid down to the<br>
nearest coordinate in the underlying motor grid, as in figure 6.<br>
<p>
Suppose that the fibres of the sensory grid receive input from the eyes'<br>
proprioceptive system, such that the position of each eye simulates a<br>
unique fibre in the upper (deformed) grid. The left eye activates one<br>
fibre from the right radial point, and the right eye activates one from<br>
the left. Joint eye-position will thus be represented by a simultaneous<br>
stimulation at the appropriate coordinate intersection in the upper grid.<br>
<p>
Underneath this point in the upper map lies a unique intersection in<br>
the motor grid. Suppose that this intersecting pair of orthogonal motor<br>
fibres, when jointly activated, induces the arm to assume the position that<br>
is appropriate to the specific motor coordinate intersection where this<br>
motor signal originates in the lower map.<br>
<p>
Happily, the relative metrical deformations in the maps have placed<br>
in correspondence the appropriate points in the upper and lower maps.<br>
We need now suppose only that the vertical connections between the sensory<br>
grid and the motor grid function as "and-gates" or "threshold switches,"<br>
so that a signal is sent down the vertical connection to the motor grid<br>
exactly if the relevant sensory intersection point is simultaneously<br>
stimulated by both of its intersecting sensory fibres. Such a system will<br>
compute the desired coordinate transformations to a degree of accuracy<br>
limited only by the grain of the two grids, and by the density of their<br>
vertical connections. I call such a system a _state-space sandwich_.<br>
<p>
Three points are worth noting immediately about the functional properties<br>
of such an arrangement. First, it will remain partially functional despite<br>
localized damage. A small lesion in either grid will produce only a partial<br>
dyskinesia (two permanent "shadows" of fibre inactivity downstream from<br>
the lesion), for which a shift of bodily position will usually compensate<br>
(by bringing the target's state-space position out of the shadow).<br>
<p>
Indeed, if the position of the crab's eyes is coded not by the activation<br>
of a single point in the upper grid, but rather by the activation of a<br>
large area (set of points) centered around the 'correct' point, and if the<br>
arm muscles respond by averaging the distributed output signal from the<br>
now multiply-stimulated lower map, than an appropriate motor response will<br>
be forthcoming even if the sandwich has suffered the scattered loss of a<br>
great many cells. Such a system will be functionally persistent despite<br>
widespread cell damage. The quality of the sensorimotor coordination will<br>
be progressively degraded under cell damage, but a roughly appropriate<br>
motor response will still be forthcoming.<br>
<p>
Second, the system will be very, very fast, even with fibres of biological<br>
conduction velocities (10 &lt; \nu &lt; 100 m/s). In a creature the size of a crab,<br>
in which the total conduction path is less than 10 cm, this system will yield<br>
a motor response in well under 10 milliseconds. In the crab-simulation<br>
described earlier, my computer (doing its trigonometry within the software)<br>
takes 20 times that interval to produce a motor response on-screen, and its<br>
conduction velocities are on the order of the speed of light. Evidently,<br>
the massively parallel architecture of the state-space sadwich buys a large<br>
advantage in speed, even with vastly slower components.<br>
<p>
And third, the quality of of the crab's coordination will not be uniform<br>
over its field of motor activity, since in the maximally deformed areas<br>
of the sensory grid, small errors in sensory registration produce large<br>
errors in the motor respose (see again figure 5b). Accordingly, the crab<br>
is least well coordinated in the area close between its eyes, and to its<br>
extreme right and left.<br>
<p>
All three of these functional properties are biologically realistic. And<br>
the sandwich appears biologically realistic in one further respect: it is<br>
relatively easy to imagine such a system being grown. Distinct layers can<br>
confine distinct chemical gradients, and can thus guide distinct <br>
morphogenetic processes. Accordingly, distinct topographical maps can <br>
appear in closely adjacent layers. But given that the maps are so closely <br>
contiguous, and assuming that they are appropriately deformed, the <br>
problem of connecting them up so as to produce a functional system <br>
becomes a trivial one: the solution is just to grow conductive elements <br>
that are roughly orthogonal to the layers.<br>
<p>
Different creatures will have different means of locating objects, and<br>
different motor systems to effect contact with them, but all of them will<br>
face the same problem of coordinating positions in their sensory state space<br>
with positions in their motor state space, and the style of solution here<br>
outlined is evidently quite general in nature. The point to be emphasized<br>
is that a state-space sandwich constitutes a simple and biologically <br>
realistic means for effecting any two-dimensional ot two-dimensional <br>
coordinate transformation, whatever its mathematical complexity, and <br>
whatever features -- external or internal, abstract or concrete -- that <br>
the coordinate axes may represent to the brain. If the transformation can <br>
be graphed at all, a sandwich can compute it. The sensorimotor problem <br>
solved above is merely a transparent example of the general technique at <br>
work.<br>
<p>
Switching now from functional to structural considerations, I hope it is<br>
apparent that, beyond the issue of functional realism, the system of<br>
interconnected maps in figure 6 is suggestively similiar to the known<br>
physical structure of typical laminar cortex, including the many topographic<br>
maps distributed across the cerebral surface. In all of these areas, inputs<br>
address a given layer of cells, which layer frequently embodies a metrically<br>
deformed topographic map of something-or-other. And outputs leave the area<br>
from a different layer, with which the first layer enjoys massiver vertical<br>
connections.<br>
<p>
I therefore propose the hypothesis that the scattered maps within the <br>
cerebral cortex, and many subcerebral laminar structures as well, are all <br>
engaged in the coordinate transformation of points in one neural state <br>
space into points in another, by the direct interaction of metrically <br>
deformed, vertically connected topographic maps. Their mode of <br>
representation is state-space position; their mode of computation is <br>
coordinate transformation; and both functions are simultaneously <br>
implemented in a state-space sandwich.<br>
<p>
I can cite not a single cerebral area for which this functional hypothesis<br>
is known to be true. To decide the issue would require knowing in some detail<br>
both the topical and te metrical character of the topographic maps in each<br>
of the contiguous laminae that constitute a given area of cerebral cortex.<br>
In general, we still lack such information. However, there is a <br>
phylogenetically older and simpler laminar structure located on the <br>
dorsal midbrain whose upper and lower maps have both been decoded, and it <br>
does display both the structural and the functional patter portrayed in <br>
figure 6.<br>
<p>
The superior colliculus (figure 7) sustains the familiar reflex whereby the<br>
eye makes an involuntary saccade so as to foveate or to look directly at<br>
any sudded change or movement that registers on the retina away from its<br>
central high-resolution area of fovea. e ahve all had the experience of<br>
being in a darkened movie theater when someone down in the front row left<br>
suddenly ignites a match or lighter to light a cigarette. Every eye in the<br>
house makes a ballistic saccade to fixate this brief stimulus, before<br>
returning to the screen. This reflex is the work of the superiour colliculus.<br>
Appropriately enough, this is sometimes called the 'visual grasp reflex.'<br>
