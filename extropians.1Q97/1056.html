<i>&gt; [Discussion of size and existence of Tertiary predators]</i><br>
<p>
  I summarize from Terry A. Vaughn's _Mammalogy_, 3rd. ed., (Harcourt<br>
Brace Jovanovich, 1986), which was used in the upper-division<br>
mammalogy class I took at San Jose (California) State University two<br>
years ago:  <br>
<p>
    The fossil record for cats is not very complete, but the earliest,<br>
(family _Nimravidae_, not _Felidae_) appeared in the Early Oligocene<br>
(roughly 40 million years ago), with retractile claws and dentition<br>
like modern cats, with additionally some having "saber-like" upper<br>
canines.  The book has an photograph of a complete fossil Oligocene<br>
sabertooth skeleton, length perhaps a bit more than a meter from nose<br>
to base of tail, and has drawings of skulls of several other Oligocene<br>
large-toothed cats, that size and a little larger; later ones were<br>
bigger still.  This family lasted through the Pliocene.  _Felidae_ --<br>
the family to which modern cats belong -- appeared in the Miocene, but<br>
later in the Miocene and in the Pliocene radiated into both<br>
saber-toothed and non-saber-toothed species; some saber-toothed<br>
_Felidae_ had skulls almost as large as those of modern lions.<br>
Saber-toothed _Felidae_ survived until the end of the Pleistocene, and<br>
may have coexisted with humans.  "Saber teeth" are an adaptation that<br>
has occurred at least four separate times in mammals, likely as a<br>
specialized adaptation for killing large prey, likely by ambush.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In any case it's more than a little remarkable that there is so few data</i><br>
<i>&gt; about a possible big cat ancestor who could have hunted the occasional</i><br>
<i>&gt; afarensis.</i><br>
<p>
  Sigh, not remarkable at all...  Who funds paleontology?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                                                      I'm 90% sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; any predecessor of panthera genera couldn't have been around at</i><br>
<i>&gt; lucy's time, and if it was, it was in its infancy, far from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; maneater modern lions and leopards are.</i><br>
<p>
  Well, if you believe in evolution, the predator of _Panthera_ had to<br>
be around :-).  The rather limited outline presented by Vaughn<br>
certainly suggests the presence of large, powerful cats at that time<br>
(which is not to say that any of these were the direct ancestor of<br>
_Panthera_).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any big cat that developed before the main group of big cats</i><br>
<i>&gt; (panthera) must have been acynonix genera.</i><br>
<p>
  Vaughn shows _Acinonyx_ and _Panthera_ as both derived from a common<br>
non-saber-toothed _Felindae_ ancestor, after the split of<br>
saber-toothed _Felinidae_ from non-saber-toothed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ***The one thing i may have overlooked is that panthera genera</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably developed from a large species of proto-acinonyx. So at</i><br>
<i>&gt; best we have a transitional acinonyx-panthera at lucy's time (again:</i><br>
<i>&gt; of which there doesn't seem to be any name or data).</i><br>
<p>
  Most people seem to think of _Acinonyx_ as more derived, having lost<br>
its retractile claws (which its ancestors had had for tens of millions<br>
of years). <br>
