Authoritarian socialism didn't work for Diocletian any better than<br>
it worked for Brezhnev, and the reasons why have nothing to do with<br>
the presence or absence of democratic institutions. I fail to<br>
understand why it is wrong for me to refuse to adapt to policies<br>
that I am quite sure are counterproductive to the vast majority of<br>
human goals, including my own.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Personally i'd go with any political system that allows the best</i><br>

<p>
Transhumanist goals to one side, I will not "go with" any political<br>
system that legitimizes the use of violence to punish voluntary<br>
and consensual exchanges without first proving a specific negative<br>
externality. I will not "go with" any political system that treats<br>
half the laboring time of its human population as a resource to be<br>
disposed of at the government's whim, which is the current situation<br>
in most of the world. I will not "go with" any political system<br>
that legitimizes the imprisonment of human beings for such harmless<br>
acts as growing and selling cannabis plants. Nor will I seek a<br>
political order in which the government loots the resources of<br>
non-transhumanists in order to finance the pursuit of transhumanist<br>
goals, and I will oppose those who do seek such a political order.<br>

<i> &gt;Fact is the American capitalist system works best at this</i><br>
<i> &gt;point in our status of development (for most people that is, but again</i><br>
<i> &gt;that's what a democracy is about isn't it ?), but that doesn't mean we can</i><br>
<i> &gt;sit back and relax, until it doesn't work anymore. More efficient ways can</i><br>
<i> &gt;be found,</i><br>
<p>
I guess you didn't notice, but it seems to me that many of the<br>
Americans on this list favor quite radical changes in the system<br>
of government here...  only the changes favored are in the opposite<br>
direction from what you are suggesting we "accept".<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;more on your political/social and historical perspectives. But instead you</i><br>
<i> &gt;all seem to assume a capitalist democracy in its current form (The United</i><br>
<i> &gt;States of Earth ?) ruling the universe for eons to come i guess. </i><br>
<p>
Many of the people on this list are agorists (propertarian anarchists),<br>
and emphatically *not* democrats. Personally, I think a "United<br>
States of Earth" would be a political disaster, and I will do what<br>
little I can to prevent such a behemoth from forming as long as I<br>
live on this planet.  Constitutionally-limited representative<br>
democracy seems to me to be the least evil form of insolent<br>
aristocracy under which human beings have slaved and sweated their<br>
days on Earth so far, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, and<br>
I don't.<br>
<p>
Just say no to death and taxes.<br>
