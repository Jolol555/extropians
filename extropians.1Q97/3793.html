LDC: &lt;This is insufferable misinterpretation<br>
of Popper, and with no excuse given other than Stove's own emotional<br>
discomfort with carefully reasoned ideas....  Mr. Stove seems uncomfortable<br>
with the obvious fact that expanding knowledge implies expanding<br>
ignorance....  Mr. Stove's discomfort with "conjectural knowledge" is<br>
merely cowardice: he doesn't want to admit that every act taken by every<br>
human being is a gamble on the efficacy of what we call knowledge.  He<br>
seems dismayed by that rather than enlivened and freed.  That's /his/<br>
failure, not Popper's.&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;RJ: Oh my.  Armchair pschoanalytical attributions of emotional defects to</i><br>
<i>&gt;other individuals' reasoning processes does not make those reasoning</i><br>
<i>&gt;processes irrational.  The armchair stance itself is irrational; it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasoning, it is political invective.  Popper's "carefully reasoned ideas,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;as you put it, were in fact, sloppily executed attempts to unsuccessfully</i><br>
<i>&gt;deduce his way out of a wet paper bag.  See the fatal critique below.</i><br>
<p>
And those last two senteces are clean epistemology?  I indulged in a bit<br>
of psychologizing precisely because Stove's rhetoric deserved no better.<br>
Your "fatal critique" is also riddled with content-free connotations and<br>
hidden implications.  At least I was honest enough to use "seems" in my<br>
rhetoric: Stove seems to take himself seriously.  Nonetheless, if you<br>
and others might be taken in by him, I suppose a more careful analysis<br>
of his mistakes might be useful, so I'll attempt it here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Popper's criterion of falsifiability requires that we be able to single</i><br>
<i>&gt; out a special class of sentences and call them observation sentences.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposition is then said to be falsifiable precisely when it is related to</i><br>
<i>&gt; observation sentences in a special way:  Proposition P is falsifiable if</i><br>
<i>&gt; and only if P deductively implies at least one observation sentence O.  One</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem with Popper's proposal is that it requires that the distinction</i><br>
<i>&gt; between observation statements and other statements be made precise.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; check the statement 'The chicken is dead,' you must know what a chicken is</i><br>
<i>&gt; and what death is.  *This problem is sometimes expressed by saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt; observation is theory laden.*   Every claim that people make about what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they observe depends for its justification on their possessing prior</i><br>
<i>&gt; information.  Popper addresses this problem by saying that what one regards</i><br>
<i>&gt; as an observation statement is a matter of convention.  But this solution</i><br>
<i>&gt; will hardly help one tell, in a problematic case, whether a statement is</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiable.  For Popper's criterion to have some bite, there must be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonarbitrary way to distinguish observation sentences from the rest.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; date, no one has managed to do this in a satisfactory manner.</i><br>
<p>
That's true, but to mistake "lack of adequate, precise explanation" of a<br>
phenomenon (such as "observation") for the non-existence of the phenomenon<br>
is exactly the justificationist mistake that critical rationalism avoids.<br>
Observation exists; to deny that is an inexcusable evasion of reality.<br>
You might as well say that we don't have a precise definition of life, so<br>
we cannot reason from the existence of life as a premise.  Popper gave<br>
an epistemological method for using observation to falsify propositions.<br>
Since observation is the foundation of other epistemologies as well, you<br>
must criticise not observation itself, but his method of using it compared<br>
to theirs.  If it is irrational to use observation to falsify, then it is<br>
just as irrational to use observation to verify or justify.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problems with Popper's falsifiability criterion go deeper.  First,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is the so-called tacking problem.  Suppose that some proposition S is</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiable.  It immediately follows that the conjunction of S and any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other proposition N is falsifiable as well.  That is, if S makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; predictions that can be checked observationally, so does the conjunction S</i><br>
<i>&gt; &amp; N.  This is an embarrassment to Popper's proposal since he wanted that</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposal to separate nonscientific propositions N from properly scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; propositions S.  Presumably, if N is not scientifically respectable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; neither is S &amp; N.  The falsifiability criterion does not obey this</i><br>
<i>&gt; plausible requirement.</i><br>
<p>
This plausibility exists only in your mind, not mine (nor, presumably,<br>
Popper's).  Sometimes it is not obvious that a statement is a conjunction<br>
of two propositions; that is a feature of the ambiguity of language.  The<br>
act of pointing out such a mistake is good science.  If years of study<br>
have provided observations that failed to falsify S&amp;N, then when someone<br>
later expresses that proposition as actually a conjunction of two, that<br>
new definition will serve to determine which of all those observations<br>
might have falsified either S or N.  If none would have falsified N by<br>
itself, then its former alliance with (or rather parasitism on) S is no<br>
reason to grant it any respectability it didn't earn on its own merit.<br>
Darwin's Lamarckism is a good example.  Before Lamarckism was largely<br>
refuted, his theories contained it.  Are we to then grant it unwarranted<br>
respectability, simply because Darwin's observations once supported it?<br>
No, we must reinterpret those observations as they serve the two<br>
propositions seperately.  Since none of his observations might have<br>
falsified Lamarckism (because he didn't try), they do not support it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another problem with Popper's proposal is that it has peculiar</i><br>
<i>&gt; implications about the relation of a proposition to its negation.  Consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; a statement of the form 'All As are B.'  Popper judges this statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiable since it would be falsified by observing a single A that fails</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be B.  But now consider the negation of the generalization-the statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; that say 'There exists an object that is both A and not-B.'  This statement</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not  falsifiable; no single observed object or finite collection of them</i><br>
<i>&gt; can falsify this existence claim.  So the generalization is falsifiable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though its negation is not.  But this is very odd-presumably, if a</i><br>
<i>&gt; statement is 'scientific,' so is its negation.  *This suggests that</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiability is not a good criterion for being scientific.*</i><br>
<p>
Statements--propositions--are neither scientific nor unscientific; it<br>
is the epistemological method used to judge them that is evaluated<br>
in those terms.  But this is sometimes confusing--and Popper himself<br>
is guilty of confusing language in this regard (or perhaps we can<br>
blame his translators)--because we fail to see sometimes that our<br>
choice of how to express a proposition implies in our minds the<br>
epistemological method appropriate to test it.  So when Popper says<br>
that P is a more scientific statement than ~P, what he really means<br>
is that the method implied for testing proposition P, expressed in<br>
that form, is superior to the method implied by expressing it in the<br>
form of ~P.<br>
<p>
A proposition and its negation are just two points of view on the<br>
same semantic relationship, but the definitions of entities in the<br>
relation creates fundamental assymetries in measuring verisimilitude.<br>
Take the definition of "A"; it is a set of rules for partitioning all<br>
of entity-space into "A" and "non-A".   Since entity-space is infinite,<br>
we expect the cardinality of set {A} to be less than that of {non-A}.<br>
Threfore, when we postulate a relationship such as "all A's are B",<br>
any observations we make of non-A entities do not increase knowledge<br>
much because they represent such an infinitesimal sample of {non-A}.<br>
Observations of A's, on the other hand, increase verisimilitude by a<br>
greater amount, because each A is a much larger sample of {A} than<br>
each non-A is of {non-A}.  Thus, in general, we may call observations<br>
of {A} more scientific than observations of {non-A}, because they are<br>
more likely to raise the virisimilitude of the proposition.<br>
<p>
So, the statements "All A's are B" and "There exists an A that is not<br>
B" are equivalent (but opposite) statements, and equally scientific.<br>
But the method implied by stating it the first way, namely, "Attempt<br>
to falsify by looking for A's that are not B", is the superior<br>
scientific method to any method looking at all existents as implied by<br>
the latter statement, becase it is more likely to be falsified.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Still another problem with Popper's proposal is that most theoretical</i><br>
<i>&gt; statements in science do not, all by themselves, make predictions about</i><br>
<i>&gt; what can be checked observationally.  Theories make testable predictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; only when they are conjoined with auxiliary assumptions.  Typically, T does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not deductively imply O; rather, it is T &amp; A that deductively implies O</i><br>
<i>&gt; (here, T is a theory, O is an observation statement, and A is a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; auxiliary assumptions).  This idea is sometimes called Duhem's Thesis...</i><br>
<p>
And your point is?  Really, I don't understand what you think is a problem<br>
here.  You already use the weasel-word "most" to admit that some statements<br>
do imply falsifiable observations by themselves, but even supposing that<br>
they required an additional assumption to test, can't you then judge the<br>
value of the observation based on the falsifiability of the assumption?<br>
If you accept the assumption as an axiom, then the observation tests the<br>
original proposition; if you later falsify the assumption, then the test<br>
no longer bears on the proposition, and you will have to find either a<br>
better assumption or a way to test the proposition directly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The final problem with Popper's proposal is that it entails that</i><br>
<i>&gt; probability statements in science are unfalsifiable.  Consider the</i><br>
<i>&gt; statement that a coin is fair-that its probability of landing heads when</i><br>
<i>&gt; tossed is 0.5.  ...It is possible for a fair coin to land heads on all ten</i><br>
<i>&gt; tosses, to land heads on nine and tails on one, and so on.  Probability</i><br>
<i>&gt; statements are not falsifiable in Popper's sense.  In fact, something like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Likelihood Principle is what Popper himself adopted when he recognized</i><br>
<i>&gt; that probability statements are not falsifiable.</i><br>
<p>
And your point is?  Again, I don't see your problem here.  Probabilities<br>
in, probabilities out.  Mathematicians deal well with this, why can't<br>
philosophers?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [Assymetry, conjunction, etc.]</i><br>
<p>
This is just a repeat of arguments dealt with above, so I'll skip it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One problem with Popper's asymmetry thesis is that it equates what can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; known with what can be deduced validly from observation statements. </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, science often makes use of nondeductive argumentation, in which</i><br>
<i>&gt; the conclusion is said to be rendered plausible or to be well supported by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the premisses.  In such arguments, the premisses do not absolutely</i><br>
<i>&gt; guarantee that the conclusion must be true.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think Popper would disagree with any of that; in fact, I don't<br>
see any conflict at all.  Such "generally accepted" inductive arguments<br>
can be pragmatic, but that doesn't raise them to the level of scientific<br>
until you can demonstrate falsifiability.  "Plausible" just means they<br>
might be worth the effort to try to falsify.  Since there are likely to<br>
be hundreds of such generally accepted ideas at any one time, how might<br>
you choose which ones to invest research in?  Simple: which ones are<br>
likely to be the cheapest to falsify?  That doesn't prevent you from<br>
holding others as assumptions if you like them for esthetic reasons or<br>
whatever.  It just gives a more solid reason for choosing research.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the face of it, vulnerability appears to be a defect, not a virtue. </i><br>
<p>
Then it's a good thing we and Popper look deeper than the face of it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why is it desirable that the hypotheses we believe should be refutable? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't science be more secure if it were invulnerable to empirical</i><br>
<i>&gt; disconfirmation?  </i><br>
<p>
It might be, but reality didn't give us that world.  It gave us the<br>
one with senses and cognition the way they are, not the one with God's<br>
plan written in big letters on the sky.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Likelihood Principle helps answer these questions.  The consequence</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this principle is that if O favors H1 over H2, then not-O would favor</i><br>
<i>&gt; H2 over H1.  This is because if P(O/H1) &gt; P(O/H2), then P(not-O/H1) &lt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; P(not-O/H2) [Original had H1 here; assuming it was a typo].  We want our</i><br>
<i>&gt; beliefs to be supported by observational evidence.  For this to be possible,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they must be vulnerable; there must be possible observations that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; count against them.  This requirement is not a vestige of the discredited</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiability criterion. It flows from the Likelihood Principle itself."</i><br>
<p>
In other words "Here is Popper's falsifiability criterion, expressed in<br>
more optimistic-sounding justificationist language so I can call it my<br>
own original idea, and call Popper's 'discredited' for an additional<br>
gratuitous insult."  This principle as you describe it really is just<br>
Popper's falsifiability from a different point of view.  It is almost<br>
precisely Popper's equations desribing verisimilitude.<br>
