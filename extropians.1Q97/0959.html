Which brings us to the most likely theory regarding the latter phases <br>
of our pre-human evolution -- an unterminated positive feedback loop of<br>
Afarensis/homonids competing against same.  A process that would have<br>
would presumably terminate only after having driven the evolution of<br>
human form to some physiological limit once they started throwing stones<br>
and/or words/protowords at each other on a regular basis.<br>
<p>
About the earlier phases when we were supposedly acquatic.  I find that<br>
troublesome either way.  Without large carnivourous land predators, <br>
"chimps throwing rocks" are pretty much on top of the food chain and so<br>
"the evasion of predators", one of the big calling cards behind the <br>
"wading ape theory" takes a big loss.  Still the diving reflex, fur-<br>
lessness, salt metabolism, subcutaneous fat, and newborn swimming <br>
ability (to the extent that these things hold up factually) do seem<br>
to be better explained this way than otherwise.  Seems like the mystery<br>
of this earlier phase only deepens.<br>
