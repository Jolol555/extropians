Since no one from the Earth crowd has even suggested an active defense<br>

Which makes your defense problem much harder, as you now get to try to<br>
detect and shoot down many more and smaller missiles.  30 times more<br>
missiles, using the sizes just above.  Admittedly Earth has to have that<br>
many more rockets delivering the warheads, but I think it just might<br>
manage that for the sake of defense.<br>

So is the 15 ton rock impact.<br>
