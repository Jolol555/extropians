I am aware that this might be a little off subject but it is one of my<br>
hobby's to argue with theists.  I am aware that I do not have a chance of<br>
changing their views.  Right now my current goal is having someone say,<br>
"That's a good argument, but I still believe."<br>
<p>
I'm posting this now because I actually met someone who I did not have to<br>
give them a God to believe in.  Usually a theist's conception of their god<br>
is so underdeveloped the first step is to get a definition.  I'll outline<br>
my best argument so far.<br>
<p>
First, I ask a question:<br>
Is God omniscient?<br>
<p>
If the answer is no, than I'm sunk because then my arguement is that a<br>
person could become God and that sort of blasphemy tends to block the minds<br>
quickly.<br>
<p>
If the answer is yes, than it gets interesting.<br>
<p>
I use the maximum possible definition of ominiscent.  At this point I<br>
eliminate many other people who just don't follow what comes next.<br>
<p>
If a being is omniscent then it knows the position and state of every<br>
particle in the universe.  Of course, to get that kind of resolution, the<br>
being would need the entire universe as a storage device.  Since adding any<br>
thought to this being would result in more information in the universe we<br>
are left with the problem of infinite simulations within simulations.  This<br>
leads to paradox and a paradox is the conclusion of a negative proof.<br>
<p>
I need some feedback on this.  I want to refine this arguement until there<br>
are as few scientific holes in it as possible.  I would appreciate all<br>
help.<br>
