The discussion of Mr Carwash's response to Natasha's "BUSINESS: Transhuman<br>
Posters" post seem to have turned on two aspects: intially, it's rather<br>
inept rhetorical style, and, more recently, it's scientific content. There<br>
is, however, a third issue raised within Johnny's diatribe, which concerns<br>
the interpretation of Natasha's proposed piece of work. And, indeed, it may<br>
be that there is a point to be made within this context. However, to<br>
discuss it further I want to get away from the original post (although not<br>
entirely), and at the same time, hopefully, distance myself from the<br>
previous debates it has generated.<br>
<p>
So, let us suppose that a piece of art is created showing a concept which<br>
violates a fundmental physical law. This being the case, one can consider<br>
the bases upon which it can be criticized. The fundamental realization here<br>
is that there is a discourse between the observer and the artwork, and that<br>
the involvement of the observer allows for multiple interpretative<br>
frameworks to exist of a single picture.<br>
<p>
The portrayal of scientific impossibility is not, of itself, inherently<br>
critizable. As an analogy: the works of Escher aren't seen to undermine<br>
mathematics simply because they use optically deceptive techniques to<br>
portray three-dimensionally impossible topologies. Similarly, religious<br>
iconography escapes criticism from some (though probably no-one on this<br>
list) despite containing images which are considered pure fantasy when<br>
post-Enlightment rationality is brought to bear to the exclusion of other<br>
considerations. Criticism is dependent on the read meaning of the piece<br>
(which is not necessarily the intended meaning), and that meaning is<br>
constructed by the observer on the basis of pre-existing cultural<br>
information: 'A guy on two bits of wood' becomes 'Jesus' to the vast<br>
majority of people brought up within Western society.<br>
<p>
And yet, of course, scientific anomaly in art may be critized for itself,<br>
if the observer interprets the piece as intending to present a scientific<br>
prediction or analysis. Such an interpretation may arise through a reading<br>
of the piece itself, or through the application of external knowledge to<br>
inform the reading of the piece. Johnny's interpretation of Natasha's<br>
proposed work is as a representation of predicted science, and that<br>
interpretation arises, perfectly reasonably, both through discussion of the<br>
piece on this list, and the naming of the piece by Natasha as a 'Transhuman<br>
poster'.<br>
<p>
The wider issue is that Extropic Art, labelled as such, and/or disseminated<br>
by artists associated with Extropianism carries a message beyond its<br>
self-contained information. Interpretation of this artwork will either be<br>
informed by knowledge of Extropianism, or will take on a function of<br>
conveying Extropian concepts, or, most likely, both.<br>
<p>
Extropianism is not a purely scientific endeavour, and, as far as I know,<br>
has never been 'marketed' as such. And yet, even in its more political and<br>
'self-empowering' aspects it calls upon a Western rationalism which finds<br>
its basis in the scientific endeavour. It would be facile to suggest that<br>
Extropic Art intrinsically undermines that scientific endeavour, or<br>
dissociates that endeavour from Extropianism. But, the producers of any<br>
artwork explicitly associated with Extropianism, or even any artists who<br>
are recognized as Extropian, whether or not they consider their art<br>
Extropian, should be aware that they will be perceived as conveying an<br>
Extropian message. The effect of that message is observer-dependent.<br>
'Incorrect' science may be perceived as artistic licence; it may reflect<br>
purely on the artist, if the observer is 'au fait' with the existing schema<br>
of Extropianism; or it may serve to undermine the Extropian message. This<br>
is, of course, true of not just the scientific discourse produced by<br>
Extropian Art, but equally any political, moral, etc. content.<br>
<p>
Art is a discourse, and the creators of Extropic Art act as a voice for<br>
Extropianism; indeed, they may define Extropianism. Without a central<br>
authority, either person or text, to ratify such definition, there is a<br>
real risk of representation which does not reflect the views of the<br>
majority, but does reflect upon them.<br>
