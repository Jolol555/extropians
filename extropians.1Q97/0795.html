        When one takes into consideration the fact that all known bipedal<br>
species have either hands or wings, the answer appears quite evident.  The<br>
increasing size in the brain of a pre-human began to pave lots of room for<br>
evolutionary innovation.  When the pre-human started to think, he realized<br>
that he would love to have a weapon to kill his food; unfortunately, he<br>
couldn't yet brandish a weapon and run after his desired prey at the same<br>
time.  Paralleling the need for weapons etc., the pre-human also started to<br>
think of how nice those apples started to look on those branches.  Hmmm.<br>
Too bad he couldn't reach them.  The pre-human began to *need* the weapons<br>
and apples, lest his new found thoughtwaves stagnate.  Neccesity is the<br>
mother of invention, and pre-humans had the need to change.  And as all<br>
creatures seem to have, the pre-human adapted through change.  The muscles<br>
in his thighs strengthened, and his back began to straighten.  Before long,<br>
the pre-human became human and progress rapidly made its way through the<br>
cascades of mankind.  <br>
