<p>
There *are* other classes of organic self-replicating compounds that have<br>
recently (last 10 years) been discovered but they don't appear in biology<br>
and I don't know that much about them.  <br>
<p>
Actually, I think there is a possibility that these polymers may be better<br>
suited for computing than DNA.  I doubt anyone has considered this before,<br>
since so few people are aware that other classes exist, not to mention that<br>
few computer gurus are chemistry gurus also.  <br>
<p>
Now that I have got myself interested, I will have to look into it.<br>
