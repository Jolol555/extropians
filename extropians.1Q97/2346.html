<i>&gt;   The front page center column (normally odd little stories) of Friday's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wall Street Journal has a report on the cryonics industry, with particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; coverage of Paul Wakfer and Dr. Olga Visser.  Mr. Wakfer is president of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cryospan and organizer of the Prometheus Project which would attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate revival of a central nervous system.</i><br>
<p>
Paul is stuck at about $300K in pledges cuz he's now tapped everybody<br>
who<br>
is into cryonics. When asked at a Bay Area Cryo meeting about his<br>
motivation<br>
it was to the effect that a successful revival would spark interest in<br>
cryonics. I'm in the nanotech camp myself and see little point to the<br>
Promethius project. IMHO it will take far more than $1M in research to<br>
accomplish the putative task, and it may actually not be possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Dr. Visser is a South</i><br>
<i>&gt; African researcher who claims to have revived a rat's heart after cooling to</i><br>
<i>&gt; liquid nitrogen temperatures in a secret preservative solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   The Journal reports that Dr. Visser's work is going to be examined and</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibly replicated by her at this weekend's Alcor festival in Arizona.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Two hearts, two failures. Turns out that the demo prior to the festival<br>
involved 60 seconds immersion, not 17-20 minutes. Visser claims 45<br>
minutes<br>
in South Africa but there are questions re the apparatus used. It is not<br>
clear that 60 seconds results in anything like LN2 temperatures in the<br>
heart,<br>
and a small crack across the neurons in the heart would prevent revival.<br>
IMHO<br>
Visser goofed on the first law of demos: CHANGE NOTHING!<br>
<p>
The reason she tried the 17 minutes is that Paul Segal of Biotime told<br>
her<br>
the previous day that he would believe her results if a minimum of 15<br>
minutes<br>
immersion were done and she agreed to do this (I was there, heard the<br>
discussion).<br>
<p>
Secret preservative solution apparently discussed in last week's<br>
Cryonet, I<br>
didn't notice (2am hardly conducive to readign caarefullalydyt.,.. :-))<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The company Biotime (BTIM, NASDAQ small cap stocks) in Berkeley,</i><br>
<i>&gt; California,  is said to be "getting back" a "decent percentage" of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hamsters that it plunges into a freezing bath and reheats. </i><br>
<p>
Did successful demo of this last year, cooled to around -2 C. Was there,<br>
saw it, etc. Plunge into freezing bath NOT the technique used.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [Remember that</i><br>
<i>&gt; hamsters have a stong hibernation reflex, while humans have only a limited</i><br>
<i>&gt; hibernation capacity, in cold water for instance.]</i><br>
<p>
Not relavant here. Ask me when we are face to face and I can give more<br>
details.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Biotime is testing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; proprietaty solution to dilute blood in surgery, organ preservation, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; other human applications.</i><br>
<p>
Hextend, going into FDA trials with human subjects. I have prospectus of<br>
latest stock rights describing in detail. I bought at 5, currently at<br>
32.5. <br>
<p>
This weeks cryo meeting at Ralph Merkle's house. How about coming to<br>
the meeting?? <br>
