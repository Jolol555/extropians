[John K Clark:]<br>
<i>&gt; I have not the slightest idea because your sentence makes no sense to me, </i><br>
<i>&gt; you are using words I do not understand. Remember what the subject title of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; this post is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since I adequately nerdsnaped "symbol formation", what's left to nerdsnap </i><br>
<i>&gt; about "diphelzeation"?</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, so you asked a circular question.  So what?  How is that my<br>
fault?  I still gave you a non-circular answer.  Besides, now that I<br>
understand that you're objecting to your own question rather than my<br>
answer, it's still easy enough to get out of.  First, I use the<br>
subjective definition I scorned earlier so you understand what nerdsnap<br>
and diphelzeation are, and then I give you the cognitive definition. <br>
Still easy as pie.  So what new alteration will you make to the rules<br>
now, to prevent me from winning?<br>
<p>
The subjective referent of "explanation" is easy enough to establish:  I<br>
ask you a few "why" questions, and then say:  "See?  You just explained<br>
something."  If you think this is circular because of "why", I can<br>
exercise my subjunctive omnipotence and videotape your own brain as it<br>
goes about its course, and flash a red light whenever I detect you<br>
explaining something to yourself.  Then a red light symbolizes<br>
"explanation".<br>
<p>
This does presume that you start out by explaining things to yourself,<br>
but any human *will* do that.  And if you DON'T start out by explaining<br>
things to yourself, I'll take a &lt;bleep&gt;ing AI that I programmed with my<br>
own &lt;bleep&gt;ing bare hands and print out the &lt;bleep&gt;ing assembly and<br>
define "definition" right down to the basic &lt;bleep&gt;ing constituents of<br>
computational causality!<br>
<p>
And finally, if you ask for a non-circular definition of "definition",<br>
and I give you back an explanation with the note "this is a definition<br>
of 'definition'", and then you refuse to know that I am answering your<br>
question, so that my non-"explanation"-mentioning cognitive explanation<br>
doesn't even get processed, you can take your &lt;bleep&gt;ing &lt;bleep&gt; and<br>
&lt;bleep&gt; it up your nose.  Of course defining "definition" requires you<br>
to enact the cognitive events associated with definition!  That doesn't<br>
make it circular.  Circular reference requires that the explanation<br>
refer to itself, not that the process of comprehending the explanation<br>
refer to the explanation!<br>
<p>
Our "visual cortex" is areas 17, 18 and 19 of the brain.  Even though<br>
you took that in through your visual cortex, "visual cortex" is NOT a<br>
circular definition!  "Computer screen" is NOT a circular definition! <br>
"Quark" is NOT a circular definition!  And "sticky note" is NOT a<br>
circular definition, EVEN IF we have to refer to some actual sticky<br>
notes in order to define it!<br>
<p>
You are torturing the rules of the game!  Defining definition requires<br>
that we *use* our cognitive facilities for definition, not that we<br>
*refer* to a previously constructed symbol *representing* our cognitive<br>
facilities for definition.  It isn't circular!  Give it up!  Definition<br>
is part of objective reality just like everything else, and can be<br>
reduced to its causal constituents like all good computational<br>
phenomena.<br>
