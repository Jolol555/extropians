<i>&gt;No doubt Terry Bisson, author of this play, would find it hilarious that</i><br>
<i>&gt;his work is being stolen and disseminated from list to list without</i><br>
<i>&gt;acknowledgement.</i><br>
<p>
That's true, most artists, especially writers, hate having large amounts of<br>
people being exposed to their work. They resent it even moreso when it's a<br>
group of people who would be responsive to their work, and would be<br>
influenced by it. What irks them even more, is when this is done without<br>
malicious intent, and when the distributor claims, truthfully, not to know<br>
the origin, and makes no claims to its creation. Artists hate being heard.<br>
I'm glad you made that point.<br>
