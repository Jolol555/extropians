Linda Nagata fans might like to check out her Web page at<br>
<a href="http://www.maui.net/~nagata/index.html">http://www.maui.net/~nagata/index.html</a><br>
<p>
Her novels explore the potential limits of cryonics and, especially, <br>
nanotechnology.  Her latest is called _Deception Well_,  just <br>
published this month, and deals with the far future for a change. <br>
 Here is a snip of what she says about it:<br>
<p>
&lt;Complexity theory distinguishes between order and disorder (chaos) <br>
and places vital life precisely on the boundary. We thrive on the edge <br>
of chaos. That's a remarkable philosophy. It's a dynamic tension that <br>
serves as the core of my upcoming novel DECEPTION WELL, a "far-future <br>
cult thriller" ;-) set in a story world in which Earth has been left <br>
behind, three thousand years in the past, and war has become as subtle <br>
as ecological succession.&gt;<br>
<p>
I find her themes and thoughts to be fairly Extropian and certainly <br>
Transhumanist.  She also has some nice reviews of other recent scifi <br>
novels.<br>
