          Hal Finney responded in a positive tone to my suggestion. He <br>
          ended his post with the following words:<br>
          <br>
<i>          &gt;I want to see a free world, but I don't want my kids </i><br>
<i>          &gt;melting down into gray goo or dieing from a tailored virus. </i><br>
<i>          &gt;It is far from clear how to steer between the problems.</i><br>
          <br>
          True. A first step might be to recognize that the problems <br>
          are there, and to take them seriously. Ultimately, the best <br>
          solution may be some form of compromise. At least for me, I <br>
          place more value on having the risk of melting down into <br>
          gray goo along with the rest of humanity reduced than on <br>
          insisting on an obscure notion of absolutely unlimited <br>
          freedom. I think we would be able to overcome our bitterness <br>
          if we had to give our "right for everyone to have his or her <br>
          own nuke".<br>
