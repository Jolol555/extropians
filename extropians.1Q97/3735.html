<p>
He has given a definition. You have simply pointed out how his<br>
definition is incomplete.<br>

<p>
It is still a definition. His definition is certainly lacking as his<br>
following post points out, but it is a definition. Look up the<br>
dictionary definition of art or of the brain itself. You will see that<br>
the definitions include how such are used.<br>

<p>
Your definition of art can stand in as a referent for art. You have only<br>
shown that it is not a particularly "useful" definition, because it<br>
includes things that you do not consider art. <br>

<p>
This is exactly what I have been trying to point out. In general people<br>
do not want art defined. In general people want art to remain mystified,<br>
ephemeral, and undefined. This limits the use of art. <br>

Subjective interpretation of art: I like this, this is beautiful, I<br>
appreciate this; value judgements.<br>
<p>
Objective interpretation of art: This work is created with such and<br>
such. This work uses such and such colours in a certain ratio. This work<br>
is time based. This work uses such and such imagery. This work uses such<br>
and such sounds; collection of data to be corrolated to previously<br>
collected scientific data. No value judgements. <br>

Let us say that I were arguing that the earth is round, and you were<br>
arguing that the earth is flat. If I cannot convince you that your idea<br>
is less objectively true than my arguement that the earth is round, then<br>
there is simply no reason for us to argue. I must simply pass you by and<br>
wait for more reasonable people to be born, people who are not so<br>
attached to the archaic definitions or lack of definitions for things,<br>
people who will not accept fairy tales as valid sources of objective<br>
facts. <br>
<p>
Each generation is accepting of less and less mystification of things.<br>
Future generations will not accept our current mystification of art. You<br>
can argue with me day and night, but that will not stop the<br>
demystification and future scientific use of art. <br>

<p>
I agree that art does not always say what the artist intends. This does<br>
not matter for my use of art. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, per Gregory's comments, I will also dispute that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it necessarily communicates "conditions" any better than a variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative measures.</i><br>
<p>
Some conditions it will communicate better than others. That is why we<br>
do not have only one method of measurement. I have been talking about<br>
psychological conditions, and thus certainly agree that art has less to<br>
say, though not nothing to say, on a cultures economic status than does<br>
their balance sheets.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I like art--a lot.  I do not, however, accord it</i><br>
<i>&gt; privileged status as a source of truth.</i><br>
<p>
If it is not a source of truth or facts, then is it a source of untruths<br>
and non-facts? Is it not possible that you like the idea of art as long<br>
as it is not a source of truth, that you do not like the idea of art<br>
being a source of truth. Watch the Discovery Channel, or the Learning<br>
Channel, and you will see that archeologists very often use art as a<br>
source of truth. Archeologists can learn a great deal about a culture<br>
based on that culture's art. The archeologists do not merely "enjoy" the<br>
art as you would have them do.<br>
<p>
We often put art in time capsules on earth and in probes sent out in<br>
space. We do not do this so that future or alien cultures will enjoy our<br>
art. We do this to tell those cultures something about us. <br>
