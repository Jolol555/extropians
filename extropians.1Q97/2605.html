<p>
oh sure, it was just the only reason i could imagine. I'm however still<br>
young and i suppose at a certain age, when one has learned how to deal with<br>
things such as emotions more effectively, and once one has aquired oneself<br>
a comfortable position, life clears up a little ? and becomes worth<br>
preserving ? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For me, much of life's attraction stems from the belief that the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be a wonderful place to experience and interact with. Is this selfish,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the bad sense of the word?</i><br>
<p>
Oh i don't think so, if life itself is good, then wanting to preserve it is<br>
quite rational. Question is, is life good ? Something that can only be<br>
answered by the individual. To me personally, life isn't all that i've been<br>
told it was, but then again at least it is something, whereas in death<br>
there lies nothing, very unpractical... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;few would argue that a 50 year-old who has raised</i><br>
<i>&gt;his/her children to maturity is selfish for wanting to live another 30</i><br>
<i>&gt;odd years. </i><br>
<p>
I know many who would argue, saying that such people would have lost their<br>
productive function to society, and have become, to use some negative term<br>
'social parasites'. Most of these people are my age, and i watch as their<br>
numbers grow. I acknowledge the problem they point out, however i haven't<br>
come across a sensible solution...  <br>
<p>
This is why i pointed out we might better focus on quality of life, and<br>
with that, the possibility for people to provide for themselves longer,<br>
before we start talking about increasing lifespans, less we want it to only<br>
be for a select few, or less society gets to carry the increasing burden of<br>
humanities desire for eternal life...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That being said, if I were some sort of vampire-like creature that had to</i><br>
<i>&gt;kill or hurt innocent people in order to survive, then accusations of</i><br>
<i>&gt;selfishness would be better-founded. </i><br>
<p>
What about pensions, state funded health care etc ? The real problem is<br>
that the idea of eternal life, is so strongly rooted in our culture, that<br>
it might well be accepted as a basic human right. With which i don't have a<br>
problem, as long as its not going over the backs of those that are (still)<br>
productive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But if someone continues to interact</i><br>
<i>&gt;with others in a manner that is acceptable to those involved, why &gt;shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;they be able to strive for an indefinite life span?</i><br>
<p>
As i said, i see a big change in young peoples attitudes towards the<br>
elderly taking place. (of which i have to admit i am no exception) Maybe it<br>
is a conflict of selfishness between generations...   <br>
<p>
Whereas i agree with the ideal that everyone who would wish to, should be<br>
able to live forever, the person in question should also carry the<br>
responsability and costs of such a decision.<br>
<p>
Something that goes much further in scope than i think most people imagine.<br>
<p>
This discussion took a direction, i din't really want to see it taking (at<br>
least not yet), but i guess it was unavoidable, as it is one of the other<br>
problems i have with life extension. <br>
<p>
My views on this are that life extension cannot go without social change,<br>
and whereas i'm sure most of you will agree with me in that, i'm also<br>
pretty sure that such a social change will take a little longer than<br>
possible breakthroughs in life extension, which has been an ongoing process<br>
for some time i think...<br>
<p>
Who knows, maybe one will be the catalyst for the other ?<br>
