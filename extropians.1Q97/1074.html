I recently came across a concept that may have some relevance to at<br>
least two threads on this list.  It's called the Baldwin Effect, named<br>
after the 19th century biologist J.M.Baldwin.  It says, in short, that<br>
aquired characteristics can be inherited in a roundabout way.<br>
<p>
Computer scientist David Ackley has a good explanation by example:<br>
"Suppose you have a population of squirrels that way back in the foggy<br>
past learned to jump from tree to tree.  One population might learn to do <br>
this and another population doesn't.  The population that learned<br>
tree-jumping will get evolutionarily rewarded for things that help the<br>
task, like developing webbing between the toes, while the other<br>
population won't get rewarded for that.  So looking at this over<br>
evolutionary time, you can now see that the population that used to <br>
learn to jump from tree to tree becomes _born_ to jump from tree to<br>
tree.  What the ancestors learned, the decendants inherited.  It's like<br>
Lamarkian evolution, except it's not in fact Lamarkian."<br>
<p>
This might have some bearing on both the discusions of aquatic apes<br>
vs predators and competing memes.<br>
