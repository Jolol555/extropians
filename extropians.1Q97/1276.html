"Representation and high-speed computation in neural networks", Paul M.<br>
Churchland, in "The foundations of artificial intelligence -- A<br>
sourcebook", Derek Partridge and Yorick Wilks (ed.), Cambridge University<br>
Press (1990), pp. 337-359.<br>
<p>
1. Introduction<br>
<p>
What I want to sell you is some neuroscience. I want to sell you the idea<br>
that current neuroscience has become directly relevant to the<br>
cognititive/computational issues that have always concerned AI. In what<br>
follows I will outline a highly general scheme for representation and<br>
computation, a scheme inspired in part by the microarchitecture of both<br>
the cerebral and the cerebellar cortex. We shall also explore some of the<br>
interesting properties displayed by computing systems of this general kind.<br>
<p>
The basic claim, to be explained as we proceed, is that the brain<br>
represents specific states of affairs by implementing specific positions<br>
in an appropriate state space, and it performs computations on such<br>
representations by means of general coordinate transformations from one<br>
state space to another. (There is no suggestion that this is the only<br>
mode of information-processing in the brain. But its role does seem to be<br>
nontrivial.)<br>
<p>
That one can perform computations by this abstract means will be old news<br>
to some reasons. For them, I hope to occasion surprise with evidence<br>
about the implementation of these procedures in the microanatomy of the<br>
empirical brain. Also intriguing is the natural way in which problems of<br>
sensorimotor coordination can be solved by this approach, since from an<br>
evolutionary point of view, sensorimotor coordination is where cognitive<br>
activity had its raw beginnings. Of further interest is the very great<br>
representational power of such systems, and the truly extraordinary speed<br>
with which even biological implementations of such procedures can perform<br>
computations of great complexity.<br>
<p>
The emerging relevance of neuroscience coincides with what may of us<br>
think to be a doldrums in the affairs of traditional ('program writing')<br>
AI, and in the affairs of orthodox cognitive psychology, for which<br>
macroscopic behaviour provides the sole significant constraint on theory.<br>
The diagnosis offered here is that traditional AI needs desperately to<br>
explore, not new areas within 'program space,' but new areas within the<br>
space of possible hardwares. The hardware -- or 'wetware' -- of the<br>
empirical brain represents an existance proof of what can be done with<br>
parallel architectures radically different from those found in<br>
general-purpose serial machines. It behoves AI try to learn from that<br>
example.<br>
<p>
The diagnosis of orthodox cognitive psychology is much the same. Whatever<br>
computational activities psychology might ascribe to us, those activities<br>
must not only produce the behaviour we display, the must be implemented<br>
in the wetware we possess. To ignore the nature of that wetware, as the<br>
neurosciences are now revealing it, would be to ignore some of the<br>
strongest available constraints on the development of cognitive theory.<br>
<p>
The basic point here is as follows. So long as we assume that the brain,<br>
like a standard serial computer, is truly a general-purpose machine, then<br>
of course the nature of the hardware will carry negligeable information<br>
about the algorithms being executed. For the hardware will be a constant<br>
over the infinite range of 'programs' the brain might be running. But if<br>
the brain is not a general-purpose machine in the technical sense at<br>
issue; if the hardware is highly 'devoted' to relatively narrow areas of<br>
the computational space; then the nature of that hardware assumes an<br>
enormous importance.<br>
<p>
Accordingly, I propose to enter this discussion from the hardware end of<br>
things. In what follows I shall outline for you some of the well-known<br>
but still deeply puzzling structural features of the brain's neural<br>
architecture. I shall then outline, as a possible account of the<br>
functional signficance of those structures, the scheme of representation<br>
and computation mentioned above. I shall then outline, as a possible<br>
account of the functional significance of those structures, the scheme of<br>
representation and computation mentioned above. Bear with me, therefore,<br>
while we race through a short rehearsal of the relevant brain microstructure.<br>
<p>
2. Laminar cortex, vertical connections, and topographic maps<br>
<p>
The outer surface of the brain's great cerebral hemispheres consists of a<br>
thin layer, the classical "grey matter," in which most of their neuronal<br>
cell bodies are located [...]. If one examines the internal structure of<br>
this wrinkled layer, one finds that it subdivides into further layers<br>
[...]. Human cortex has six of these layers. Other creatures display a<br>
different number, but the laminar pattern is still standard.<br>
<p>
These further layers are distinguished by the type and concentration of<br>
cells within each sublayer. Moreover, these distinct layers are further<br>
distinguished by their proprietary inputs or outputs. The top several<br>
layers tend to have only inputs of one kind of another, from the sensory<br>
periphery, from other part of the cortex, or from other parts of the<br>
brain. And the bottom layer seems invariably to be an output layer.<br>
<p>
Finally, these distinct layers are systematically connected, in the<br>
fashion of nails struck though plywood, by large numbers of<br>
vertically-oriented cells that permit communication between the several<br>
layers. These vertical cells conduct neuronal activity "downwards," from<br>
the superficial input layers above to the output layers below.<br>
<p>
If we now leave our microscopic edgewise perspective and look down at the<br>
cortical sheet from the outside, we find that the cortical surface<br>
divides into a patchwork of smaller regions [...]. These areas are<br>
distinguished to some degree by differences in their laminar<br>
cytoarchitecture. An initial taxonomy, into what are called Brodmann's<br>
areas after their discoverer, is based on this criterion.<br>
<p>
These areas, or subareas of them, are of further interest because several<br>
of them plainly constitute topographic maps of some aspects of the<br>
sensory or motor periphery, or of some other areas of the brain. For<br>
example, the neighbourhood relations holding between the cells in a given<br>
layer of the visual cortex at the rear of the brain correspond to the<br>
neighbourhood relations holding between the cells in the retina from<br>
which they receive inputs. The bundle of axonal projections from the<br>
retinal cells to the cortical cells preserves the topographic<br>
organization of the retinal cells. The surface of the primary visual<br>
cortex thus constitutes a topographic map of the retinal surface.<br>
<p>
It is termed a 'topographic map,' rather than simply a 'map,' because the<br>
distance relations among retinal cells are generally not preserved.<br>
Typically, such maps are metrically deformed, as if they were made of<br>
rubber and then stretched in some fashion.<br>
<p>
Many such maps have been identified. The so-called "visual cortex" (areas<br>
17, 18) has already been mentioned. The upper layer of the somatosensory<br>
cortex (area 3) is a topographic map of the body's tactile surface. The<br>
lower layer of the motor cortex (area 4) is a topographic map of the<br>
body's muscle system. The auditory cortex (areas 41, 42) contains a<br>
topographic map of frequence space. And there are many other cortical<br>
areas, less well understood as to exactly what they map, but whose<br>
topographical representation of distant structure is plain.<br>
<p>
The general pattern of neural organization is not confined to the surface<br>
of the great cerebral hemispheres. As well, various nuclei of "grey<br>
matter" in the more central regions of the brain -- for example the<br>
superior colliculus, the hippocampus, and the lateral geniculate nucleus<br>
-- displays this same multilayered, topographically organized, vertically<br>
connected structure. Noth everything does (the cerebellum, for example,<br>
is rather different, of which more later), but the patterns described is<br>
one of the major organizational patterns to be found in the brain.<br>
<p>
Why this pattern? What is its functional or cognitive significance? What<br>
do these structures do, and how do they do it? We can make contanct with<br>
the representational and computational hypothesis suggested in the<br>
introduction if we first address the independently intriguing problem of<br>
sensorimotor coordination.<br>
