Exactly right!  The concept has been taken out of the political or<br>
social context where it belongs and misused in tendentious metaphysical<br>
arguments where it has no meaning.<br>
<p>
Think on this all you metaphysicians out there: would you say an atom<br>
could or couldn't have free will? <br>
<p>
Then how come you see sense in the idea that human beings can be<br>
determined?<br>
<p>
(Of course a human being could be determined by constrained by all kinds<br>
of gross pushes and pulls, by all kinds of entities at the level of the<br>
middle sized furniture of the world, including other people. I am<br>
constrained by the walls of a maze, for instance. But that's not enough<br>
for you metaphysicians is it?)<br>
<p>
Everyone folowing  this thread should check out "Elbow Room" by Dennett,<br>
god of philosophers.<br>
