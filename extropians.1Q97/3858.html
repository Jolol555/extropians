<p>
Even though the state legislature has decreed that ticket contracts are<br>
binding, the courts ignore it. It even happens in cases reminiscent of<br>
the lady who sued McDOnalds over hot coffee. Individuals were skiing<br>
outside the bounds or were skiing negligently and injured someone else,<br>
so the person who was at fault blamed the ski area for allowing him to<br>
ski that way, and won.<br>
<p>
 Same as various commercial waivers that<br>
<i>&gt; say "Void where prohibited by state law."  Contracts between individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't mean squat to the extent that the government you feel is necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; chooses to void the contracts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That the point you were trying to make?</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. unfortunately, we have a case of local legislative government<br>
being ignored by the judicial government.<br>
