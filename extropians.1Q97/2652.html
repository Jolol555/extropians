Having a random legislature isn't restricted to a small gov't; that was<br>
just a preable justifying extropian interest in legislatures.  I'd be<br>
happy to try a random Congress, or at least a random California<br>
legislature.  (The latter is probably far more feasible, with popular<br>
initiatives.)<br>
<p>
Having said this I've just read most of the essays at Friedman's site,<br>

Perhaps.  Congress already has an internal Ethics committee.  I figured<br>
