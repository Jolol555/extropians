Could you explain the causal mechanism behind your assertion,<br>
please? A lot of bad political activity gets fed with this<br>
"manipulating people's feeling of scarcity" meme.<br>
<p>
Markets for new products are usually created among early adopters,<br>
usually wealthy people with time on their hands looking for diversion,<br>
and then those markets expand rapidly if (and after) the early adopters<br>
actually find some real benefit in using the new product. I haven't read<br>
Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class yet, but I'm wondering whether or<br>
not he shows any awareness of the vital role a leisured and wealthy<br>
subset of society plays in fueling the economics of technological<br>
progress. Hayek certainly does.<br>
<p>
(There's also a business end of this in the way of corporations<br>
that have lots of cash on their hands, but I haven't read as many<br>
analyses of that situation as I have of the one outlined above. I<br>
suspect that the business angle has more to do with active interest<br>
in innovation than interest in "mere" diversion. I put scare quotes<br>
there for good reason.)<br>
