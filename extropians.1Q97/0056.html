That's exactly what Philip Zimmermann, the man who wrote PGP did. Zimmermann <br>
gave PGP to a man who gave it to someone who gave it to someone who gave it  <br>
to someone who sent it to a foreign country, I think it was New Zealand. <br>
It didn't help, the U.S. government still wanted to put Zimmermann in jail, <br>
they said he should have made sure everybody he gave PGP to did not send it <br>
out of the country or give it to somebody who would. Please don't ask me to <br>
explain the logic of this, in retrospect I don't think they ever intended to  <br>
bring it to trial, they didn't need to in order to punish Zimmermann and warn  <br>
others about doing anything similar.  <br>
       <br>
Zimmermann was not a rich man and he ended up with a second mortgage on his  <br>
house and hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to pay for his legal bills.  <br>
Zimmermann also had the worry of going to the penitentiary hanging over his <br>
head for three years until they finely dropped the charges. The point was well<br>
made, don't mess with Big Brother.<br>
