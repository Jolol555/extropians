These can be circumvented rather easily.  I've done it.  ( Not for theft,<br>
but for speed. I've got a slow 1xCD but a fast hard drive. )<br>

A TSR is put in upper memory.  It prempts the keyboard interrupt, steals <br>
commands from the keyboard buffer that are meant for it, possibly adds<br>
a few, then passes control to the keyboard interrupt routine.  This <br>
allows it to simulate keyboard input.  So with one keypress from the<br>
computer owner, lots of commands - such as 'turn page' - are generated.<br>
The trusted program spills its guts.<br>
The TSR also evesdrops on the screen writing interrupt, and copies everything<br>
to a file.<br>
<p>
If too many one-time books/videos are on the market, then somebody ( not <br>
me ) will write a program like this and pass it around.<br>
