I'd say *all* people are deeply ignorant of most everything.  There's just<br>
way too much to know.  The problem is that most people do not realize the<br>
depth of their ignorance and are unwilling to address it when emotions are at<br>
stake.  Strong emotions on weak information are a recipe for disaster; if you<br>
can't get information perhaps it's the best you can do, but in our society<br>
you can often get a lot of information about anything you care about.<br>
<p>
A proper approach for a reasonable person uninformed about cloning but afraid<br>
of it would be to research what it means.  Fairly superficial research would<br>
show that cloning is no big deal.<br>
<p>
Another reasonable approach is to refer judgements to experts.  Unfortunately<br>
many people accepted as ethical experts are from the religious field, and<br>
such people often see no need to consider reality when making their<br>
pronouncements.  After all, they do have a hotline to God, you know.  Just<br>
ask them and they'll tell you.<br>
