Prompted by our discussion of "push" technology, I spent some time searching<br>
out resources which will help you track changes to web pages.  I found a<br>
few:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/KAW/KAW96/chen/kawchrono.html">http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/KAW/KAW96/chen/kawchrono.html</a><br>
<p>
This describes CHRONO, a tool for web servers to automatically note which<br>
pages on the web site have changed, and present users a chronologically<br>
sorted list of recently-changed pages.  There is also something called<br>
Meta-CHRONO which maintains similar information across disparate sites.<br>
However I think the sites have to be running CHRONO.<br>
<p>

<p>
This is a server which lets you enter a list of URL's and your email<br>
address, and it will send you email when any of the URL's change.  It<br>
is an offshoot of the "netminder" service which will send you reminders<br>
about birthdays, anniversaries, etc. that you can specify.  No privacy<br>
here, but otherwise this could be a pretty convenient way to track your<br>
favorite sites.<br>

This is a commercial program called Surfbot which sounds like it has some<br>
relevant features.  It can download web pages to your local computer during<br>
the night, do some searches on its own, check when your bookmarks need<br>
to be updated, etc.  I'm not sure whether it can just make a list of<br>
changed sites, or whether it actually downloads copies of the changed<br>
sites to your computer.  A free demo version is available, but I haven't<br>
had a chance to look into it in more detail.<br>

This is a Mac-only program.  It looks at the history file left by your<br>
web browser, and goes out and checks each page you've visited recently<br>
to see if it has changed.  It doesn't have to download the whole page,<br>
it just asks the server for the "Last-Modified" time, so it is supposed<br>
to put relatively little load on the web.  (I don't know whether the<br>
other programs on the list also use this method.)  It's a little strange<br>
that it does this on the history file rather than the bookmark file; the<br>
author promises to add this kind of enhancement someday.<br>
<p>
<p>
For now I have put a few sample pages into the netminder URL watcher.<br>
I'll see if it works.<br>
