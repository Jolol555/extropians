<i>&gt; With the reissue of _The Probability Broach_, everyone has had a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity to say how wonderful it is.  I found it deeply flawed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here are the gripes that I remember after ~13 years:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; - All female characters are Heinlein heroines.</i><br>
<p>
If you mean that they're all tough, independent, and good shots.  Sure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - The goodguys survive because the badguys never use their guns.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the bad guys don't want to die in a firefight any more than the <br>
good guys.  There is plenty of shooting in the next few novels, if thats <br>
what you go in for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - Unable to stop the badguys' evil plan preemptively (because that</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	would be coercive), our heroes blow them up accidentally.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	This is described as a triumph of free will.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, the bad guys got it in the end. :)  This leaves the good guys <br>
triumphant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - As is Bear's double existence, as if gametes were chosen consciously.</i><br>
<p>
Well, they're parallel universes, guess the Bear family-trees were <br>
identical.  Do *you* understand the way parallel universes work?  I know <br>
I don't--never had a set to study.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - Griswold's chilling reputation is presented but never justified.</i><br>
<p>
They aren't at the center of the story, so why should they be focused on?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; - I can accept a talking gorilla.  I can accept a gorilla with an English</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	surname.  But a gorilla with an English *hyphenated* surname?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	(And does the wrist-gadget pronounce it Fanshaw?)</i><br>
<p>
Well, if you're going to have a surname, why *not* have a hyphenated <br>
surname?  And yes, the wrist-gadget quite likely *does* pronounce it <br>
Fanshaw.  <br>
<p>
Jeez, looks like you've got no sense of humor.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Am I alone in my opinion?  Did I misread or misremember?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are some of the flaws corrected in the new edition?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I hope not.  I did hear a rumor that it was an "unexpurgated version"...<br>
