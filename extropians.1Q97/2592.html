THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS JOIN TO CRACK THE HARDEST CRYPTOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE<br>
EVER<br>
<p>
<p>
Loosely organized international group checks a record 162082778549251<br>
keys in 13 days to find correct solution<br>
<p>
<p>
ZURICH: More than 5000 computers connected via the Internet have broken the<br>
most difficult cryptographic challenge ever solved, in just over thirteen<br>
days. The challenge was one of a series of cryptographic challenges recently<br>
offered by RSA Data Security, Inc., a U.S. firm which produces cryptographic<br>
software.  <br>
<p>
The Internet group's successful attempt on the challenge, which is the<br>
second record-breaking cryptographic challenge solution within the last two<br>
weeks, demonstrates in a dramatic fashion that many encryption systems -- such<br>
as those commonly used on the Internet, in electronic commerce, and in<br>
so-called "Smart Cards" -- can be broken with relative ease using modern<br>
computing techniques.<br>
<p>
The challenge was solved by a loosely organized group of individuals from<br>
around the world who banded together to create a project known as the<br>
"Distributed Internet Crack." The group was begun by Germano Caronni,<br>
member at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and quickly <br>
grew to include hundreds of people, from commercial as well as academic<br>
sites, who worked at a furious pace to write and optimize the necessary<br>
software and then run it on thousands of computers simultaneously. The<br>
group never met in person but communicated via email.  Continuously<br>
updated pages on the World-wide Web, available in four different<br>
languages, provided the latest information and progress reports.<br>
<p>
The Distributed Internet Crack first attacked the easiest of RSA's<br>
challenges.  The group solved this challenge in 3 1/2 hours, only minutes<br>
after another group submitted the correct answer.  After coming so close to<br>
winning the first challenge, the group decided to take on the second one,<br>
hundreds of times as difficult.  The challenge required that up to<br>
281474976710656 different keys be checked.<br>
<p>
By putting the power of thousands of powerful and not-so-powerful computers<br>
together via the internet, the second challenge was solved on Monday,<br>
February 10th, a little over thirteen days after it was issued.<br>
<p>
The successful completion of the challenge broke new ground in several ways:<br>
Besides cracking the hardest key ever, the event also brought together the<br>
most computers ever working on a single Internet project (over 5500 computers<br>
were operating simultaneously at one point, and over 10,000 computers joined<br>
in the project at one time or another), and produced the most cryptographic<br>
keys ever checked per second in an openly publicized effort (over 440<br>
million keys per second at peak, and an average of 140 million keys per<br>
second over the entire project).<br>
<p>
If the group would have re-attacked the 40 bit challenge with the computing<br>
power it had at the end of this effort, that key would have been broken<br>
within 45 minutes.<br>
<p>
The group is now planning to attempt another challenge issued by RSA, this<br>
time aimed at the DES cipher, which has been used in American and other<br>
financial institutions for many years.<br>
