The EEC and the potential EU seem to be a quite fascinating area to apply<br>
memetic thinking to; judging from the current tendencies the supernational<br>
levels are developing a very different reality-tunnel from the national<br>
levels, which in turn are developing their own, and so on.  We might be<br>
looking forward to an Europe with several incompatible reality models<br>
actively interfering in each other, each strongly supported by different<br>
memetic evolutionary pressures. Very fun, if you have a sense of<br>
Kafkaesque humor. <br>
<p>
Something I think we european transhumanists should think seriously about <br>
is how we are going to deal with this. Eurosclerosis is a real danger to <br>
us (just look at the european computer industry, or rather the lack of <br>
it), the borderless visions of the EU might be very useful for cryonics <br>
companies, eurocrats start to drool as soon as you mention biotechnology <br>
and there is a interdisciplinary research initiative on Malta which seems <br>
to be directed towards nanotech and biocomputers, and bureaucracies seems <br>
to be inherently anti-transhuman. Much work is definitely needed. <br>

Wouldn't it be quite easy to marry them together to create a new emperor? <br>
Of course, this might be bad genetics... ;-)<br>
