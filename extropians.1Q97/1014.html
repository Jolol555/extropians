I hardly demonize religion. I think that it has many benefits for our<br>
society, and can be at least partly credited with helping to root the<br>
idea of being nice to each other for a change among people who would<br>
typically prefer to brain the next guy as look at him. While it has<br>
greatly descreased the amount of personal animosity and violence in<br>
civilization, it has at the same time been the cause of much impersonal<br>
institutional animosity and violence.<br>
<p>
Properly practiced, religious traditions of many types can provide one<br>
with the educational/community support for a peaceful and tolerant life<br>
of searching for truth and justice. One thing that interferes with this<br>
type of life is the sort of blind acceptance of dogma that too many<br>
associate with a religious life, or attempt to enforce on others.<br>
<p>
As for the "Stupid Masses" meme, while I tend to have little respect for<br>
idiots, I also acknowledge that many people in this world are so busy<br>
simply trying to get through a days work that they typically don't have<br>
time to think about the deeper questions in life. This is a phenomena<br>
that is expected in a civilization as highly developed and intensely<br>
concentrated as ours is. We are living on a planet with a limited<br>
resource base, which we are not making much effort to expand at this<br>
time (although the opening of the communist nations resources to western<br>
exploitation has given us a temporaty reprieve), so by the laws of the<br>
market, there is less and less to go around, with rising expectations of<br>
what a minimum standard of living is, so people must work more and more,<br>
and become more and more specialized. <br>
<p>
With increasing specialization comes greater dependence on and trust<br>
towards the conclusions of other specializations in their fields. Many<br>
would not presume to question the findings of the majority of scientists<br>
in a field they have no knowledge of, and if they have no real level of<br>
interest in learning more about that field, they typically accept what<br>
they hear at face value. Given our present mental limitations,<br>
especially of those less mentally astute than those on this list, this<br>
is unavoidable, but will probably will slowly cease to be a problem once<br>
augmentation technologies become commonplace, so we can each become<br>
generalists once again, as is our natural evolutionary advantage.<br>
