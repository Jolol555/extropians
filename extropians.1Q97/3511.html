Max More found this "sadly amusing..."<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From: Pennyrue@aol.com</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;You have been given yourself, but you do not own</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;yourself.  You are property of the "eternal", and to try and crown yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;as the "eternal", would be met with great disfavor to your race. [...]</i><br>
<p>

Channeling is *kool*--for other people that is.  It reminds me of Daniel<br>
Dennett's wondering about the sudden sprouting of "Multiple Personality<br>
Disorder" cases.  You give people a new model for how to run their brains<br>
and they flock to it.  Also reminds me of Hakim Bey's talking about<br>
dirvishes and the need to get into not-normal modes to escape the spectacle,<br>
essentially.  Also reminds me of *A Course in Miracles,* a Bible-sized<br>
channeled book I haven't got past page 65 of.  Here:<br>
   A major source of the ego's off-balanced state is its lack of<br>
   discrimination between the body and the Thoughts of God.  Thoughts<br>
   of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly point to the<br>
   nonexistence of the ego itself...<br>
<p>
But!  *A Course in Miracles* led to Gerald Jampolsky's "Love is Letting Go<br>
of Fear," which was an important book to me.<br>
<p>
The future's really big, hard to get your brain around.  You see someone<br>
on TV seeming very Positive and Forward Looking and you might jump to the<br>
wrong conclusion.  The scary thought comes to you: it could happen.<br>
We could *succeed*--at steering head-first into the integrated-circuit<br>
grids of our Positive Forward Looking Wired consumer culture navels, pull<br>
the navels in after us, and leave any notion of a natural, outside world<br>
behind.  And you realize, my programming tells me how to go along with<br>
such a fate, not counter it.<br>
<p>
It just might make you want to set the controls for Canis Major.<br>
