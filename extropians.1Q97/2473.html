SCC&gt; No, really. 'Attractive' doesn't mean anything unless you have<br>
SCC&gt; a 'to whom' in mind.<br>
<p>
That's true, but "to humans" is a specific, meaningful, useful answer.<br>
We are not yet bush robots or utility fogs or bit patterns whose<br>
wills are unconstrained by our physical nature.  Even if we did upload<br>
our cognitive facilities /as they are/ into such a mechanism, the<br>
values and drives pre-coded into the system are those that evolution<br>
as a biological organism put there, and "attraction" is one of the<br>
strongest pre-coded drives, because sexual selection drives evolution<br>
faster than many other influences.<br>
<p>
In my purely rational moments, I may conclude that spending time and<br>
money on clothing is a waste of my resources, and I should therefore<br>
spend my life in plain muslin robes that I might devote more time to<br>
loftier pursuits.  Perhaps there exist women with whom I might share<br>
a fulfilling relationship who would be attracted to an unshaven man<br>
in a plain robe, but I'm not putting bets on it.  I am more likely to<br>
meet interesting women if I dress in a way that women, by their nature<br>
as evolved primates, are more likely to find attractive. <br>
<p>
I might wish to decry the injustice of it, complaining that I have to<br>
buy $40 shirts and spend time ironing them; just as some women may<br>
complain about having to make themselves up to appear more youthful.<br>
But personally, it is less effort for me to take advantage of the<br>
world as it is than to try to change what we do not yet have the<br>
technology to change.  When it comes, sign me up.  Until then, I've<br>
got dry cleaning to pick up.<br>
