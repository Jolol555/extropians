Interesting.  I'd be curious to know what the size of the debt is now, <br>
and whether you think this is the only thing stalling further progress on <br>
this project.  Perhaps now that you and the other co-founders have had <br>
time to step back from the day-to-day problems you should consider a <br>
reunion to take a fresh look at the project.  With the continued growth <br>
of the web and of "all things internet" in the past two years, it might <br>
be easier to generate interest.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; 2. The Laissez Faire City (<a href="http://www.lfcity.com/">http://www.lfcity.com/</a>) project takes a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; different tack, and is planning to obtain a 100-year lease of a parcel of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; land from some host country.  I assume they've done their homework and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are confident that such a property could be run/operated independently </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; from the host country.  They also claim to have established an "interim </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; community" in Costa Rica which allows members to live tax free.  All of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which sounds interesting, but I have a gut-level suspicion of any group </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that asks me to pay $35 for additional "research materials."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Don't know much about this one.  At least when the AP sold Constitutions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we told you up front that you were paying $30 for a paperback editition</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a document you could download for free :)  Does LFC tell you what you</i><br>
<i>&gt;get for that $35?</i><br>
<p>
Not as far as I can tell.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Do you feel that a libertarian society can be realized by working within </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the political system to change existing governments, or do you feel that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; such a society can only be realized by starting fresh from scratch?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think there is one way to do it from the inside: to form the nation (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people) before you form the country (i.e., the land).  Accumulate a</i><br>
<i>&gt;group, each of which pledges to never use force against any other member,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and slowly build that group into economic self-sufficiency (cybercash and</i><br>
<i>&gt;similar technologies help a lot here) so that the government of the land</i><br>
<i>&gt;they occupy simply atrophies, or sells itself off to us.  It may take</i><br>
<i>&gt;decades, even generations, but I think it would work to both free us and</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow us to keep our land.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, but would prefer not to wait during the amount of time that this <br>
might take.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; libertarian colony?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance.  Hope this helps to turn our discussions towards the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; more practical aspects of libertarianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would, and I have.  Personally, though, I am unlikely to discuss the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"practical" ascpects of libertarianism, as I do not look at liberty as</i><br>
<i>&gt;an end result, but rather as a prior condition; a means, not an end.</i><br>
<p>
Could you elaborate on this?  Are you approaching this from a "freedom <br>
to", rather than a "freedom from" standpoint?  From the Terra Libra-esque <br>
position that freedom begins with the individual, and that once one <br>
decides to be free that they are?  This personal liberty versus political <br>
liberty dichotomy is one that I've struggled to resolve.<br>
