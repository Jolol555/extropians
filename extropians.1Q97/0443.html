A Transhuman Fairy Tale<br>
<p>
Once upon a time in a land far, far away there lived a king and queen.<br>
Their highest wish was to have a child, but for many years the queen had<br>
remained childless. One day one of her ladies-in-waiting came to her and<br>
told her about the fairy godmothers of biotechnology, who were said to be<br>
able to help childless mothers using their magic spells. The royal couple<br>
visited the glass and steel castle of the godmothers, and a few months<br>
later the queen bore a child. <br>
<p>
The happy parents invited all the fairy godmothers to a great celebration<br>
in their castle. After a splendid dinner where the court held long<br>
eulogies over the skill and power of the godmothers, they gathered around<br>
the young princess and began to tell the parents about what they had given<br>
their daughter: genes for good health, intelligence, beauty, slimness and<br>
a predisposition for a charming personality. <br>
<p>
The godmothers were just telling about the wonderful genetic switches they<br>
had inserted so that the princess could for herself activate some of the<br>
clever spells in her body when the thirteenth godmother burst into the<br>
castle. The court had failed to invite her due to a computer error, and<br>
she was furious. She pointed at the princess and told the others that it<br>
was she who had created the genetic switch that controlled the telomerase<br>
production; without it the princess would develop cancer due to an<br>
inherited predisposition and die. With an evil laugh the evil godmother<br>
ripped the optic disc containing the sequence for the controlling protein<br>
into pieces and vanished in her black porsche. <br>
<p>
The godmothers explained to the horrified parents that there was nothing<br>
they could do; discovering how to unlock the switch would require<br>
unravelling the entire genome of the princess and solving the generalised<br>
protein structure problem, and even the spells of the godmothers could not<br>
change all her DNA once she was born.  But the twelfth and youngest<br>
godmother, who so far had kept silent since she was just a research<br>
intern, spoke up. She told the parents that she had inserted a few<br>
amphibian genes "just in case": if the princess ever got too sick they<br>
would begin to produce carbohydrates and proteins enabling a cryonic<br>
suspension. She would lie frozen until future technology could revive her. <br>
<p>
Several years went by and the princess grew up into a lovely young woman<br>
just as intelligent, beautiful, creative and healthy as the godmothers had<br>
predicted. Her father, still fearful of the curse of the thirteenth<br>
godmother, had ordered the court to only serve healthy food rich in<br>
antioxidants and low in calories, eat nutrient supplements developed by<br>
the godmothers and forbidden smoking in the entire kingdom. <br>
<p>
One day when the princess was alone in the castle she went exploring; in<br>
one of the towers she found an old library, not changed since the 19th<br>
century when its illustrious owner had died.  On the desk she found a<br>
humidor, containing strangely smelling cylinders. Her mentor AI told her<br>
it was a cigar, a drug that had once been widely used in the kingdom.<br>
Curious and unaware of the risks she tried smoking it -- and developed<br>
lung cancer. <br>
<p>
The saddened court and the godmothers could not do anything to stop the<br>
cancer from growing metastases, and finally they had to cryonically<br>
suspend the princess (although being rulers over their own kingdom, the<br>
parents could change the law so that she could be suspended well before<br>
legal death) and placed her in a capsule in an earthquake-proof bunker.<br>
Over the years a great hedge of thorns grew up around the bunker, a<br>
biodefense designed by the thirteenth godmother to make sure the princess<br>
was forgotten forever. And there she lay for one hundred years. <br>
<p>
One day a transhuman passed by through the local nets, and found a<br>
reference to the old story about the frozen princess. He found the<br>
thorn-hedge, and broke through it using his disassembler nanites -- the<br>
spells of the godmother was far from cutting edge now. He entered the<br>
silent and cold bunker, finding the capsule of the princess covered with a<br>
thick layer of frost and dust; through the translucent cover he could make<br>
out some vague contours filling him with deep longing. He opened it (not<br>
minding the liquid nitrogen that poured out since his body was covered by<br>
protective utility fog) and kissed her with lifegiving nanites that began<br>
cell repair. She opened her eyes, and fell in love with the handsome<br>
transhuman. He carried her away from the bunker, and they lived happily<br>
ever after -- since the twelfth godmother had perfected life extension<br>
therapy in the meantime. <br>
