This is an excellent idea. Recent advances in science along with the<br>
internet being an part of the life of the average American like never<br>
before, extropian and transhuman memes have begun to ooze their way into<br>
mainstream thinking. One only needs to see the way science fiction has<br>
become one of the most popular genres in the 1990s media. <br>
 <br>
As so-called "radical" ideas are embraced by the masses, it would be<br>
easier to work to get some establised institutions to work with the<br>
Extropy Institute for actual degrees.<br>
<p>
Anyone else?<br>
