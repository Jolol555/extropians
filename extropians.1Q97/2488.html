<i>        &gt;enjoyment.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you enjoyed it then you've already answered the question, you are saying <br>
Bach has value to me. What do you care what my opinion is on the subject,  <br>
or the opinion of the Universe if it has one, which I very much doubt. <br>
The Universe is dumb, that's why you're a better music critic than the <br>
Universe.<br>

<i>        &gt;Is the Meaning of Life *really* 42? [...] I refuse to give one        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;arbitrary number such power over my life!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Excellent! That's exactly the right attitude. 42 may be the meaning of life <br>
to the universe but it sure as hell isn't for you or me, the universe can <br>
take 42 and all its meaning and stick it where the sun don't shine.<br>

<i>        &gt;Take your flowchart for "consciousness", John K Clark, and apply it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to "value"!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
1) Is what Value does complex? If yes go to 2 if no explain how to reconcile <br>
   that with the way it effects our lives, both objective and subjective.<br>
<p>
2) Is Value itself complex? If yes go to 3 if no then religious people are <br>
   right Science is not important and can not help us in the most important <br>
   questions.                 <br>
   <br>
3) Is Value made of parts? If yes go to 4 if no explain how something can          <br>
   be complex yet have no structure.<br>
<p>
4) Does the Value operate in an uncoordinated, incoherent manner?       <br>
   If no go to 5 if yes explain how to reconcile that with experience, both          <br>
   objective and subjective.<br>
<p>
5) Do the parts communicate among themselves? If yes go to 6 if no explain          <br>
   how coordination is possible without communication.<br>
<p>
6) Is a part that changes in only one way (a bit) the simplest part of Value?   <br>
   If yes go to 7 if no then something that does not change at all is the <br>
   essence of Value and religious people are right, Science is not important <br>
   and can not help us in the most important questions.           <br>
<p>
7) Is Value information processing ? If yes then go to 8, if no then explain <br>
   what the difference is.                      <br>
<p>
8) Is Value a state of mind? If yes then I'm right if no explain what the   <br>
   difference is.<br>
