<i>&gt; Why or why not?  As you're thinking about this, are you deliberately arranging </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One could argue that a plant is self aware, because it adjusts its internal </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Does "awareness" mean 'responding to stimulii'?  If so, then "self awareness" </i><br>
<i>&gt; would seem to mean 'responding to self generated stimulii'.  This definition </i><br>
<i>&gt; of "self-awareness" would cover many, many types of organisms.  Should these </i><br>
<i>&gt; organisms receive legal protection?</i><br>
<p>
"Self awareness" was a poor choice of words.  Upon a little research that <br>
I should have done before I posted, I see that one could claim that <br>
animals other than humans are self aware.  <br>
<p>
I'm going to take a different approach.  Instead of arbitrarily slapping <br>
words on something and granting it legal protection b/c of that label,  <br>
I'll ask "What can it do?"  This way I hope to avoid the difficulties of <br>
assigning properties to "conciousness" and "self aware,"  two words that <br>
seem to have very plastic definfitions, depending on who wields them.  <br>
Note that I consider this a working concept,. ,ion, and as such it is <br>
subject to refinement, and/orot ridicule :-).<br>
<p>
This time I am making the assumption  that any _artificial_ being that <br>
fills the following requirement can communicate with whoever (human or <br>
not) made it.  0f course this assumes that those who create artificial <br>
intelligence will have no use for AI that cannot communicate with its <br>
creators.  I apply this test only under the bove conditions, and does <br>
not apply where is a descrepency between a creatures apparent <br>
ability to reason and its inability (for whatever reason) to communicate<br>
with whoever despenses justice.  For instance animals, ET.<br>
<p>
Here is my improved criteria for granting legal protection:  If a being <br>
is able to grasp the concept of legal protection and ask for it, then <br>
that being should receive it.  <br>
<p>
That should be followed with "because..."  If I try to take it any <br>
further right now, I'll end up saying "because I said so."  <br>
Just like my belief that it is more wicked to force someone to help himself than it <br>
to let that person kill himself out of his ignorance.  I have not yet been <br>
able to connect either of these preferences to concretes (is that <br>
possible?).  Both issues require more thought...  <br>
<p>
Qualifiers aside,<br>
I think this test works b/c it is simply a hoop to jump through, and <br>
doesn't depend on the current consensus on the meaning of elusive words.  <br>
If an AI is smart enough to ask for it, it deserves protection under the <br>
law.  However, it is for a special case and does not currently cover <br>
important cases like the mentally handicapped, small children, many <br>
others that escape me right now. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why should legal protection be based on how *conscious* a system is?  Why not </i><br>
<i>&gt; on how beautiful a system is or on how much it weighs or some other property? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Only systems that are *concious* enough to grasp justice have a need for <br>
it.  If a beautiful or super-heavy system is smart enough to ask for <br>
protection, then protect it.  Other wise let those with a concept of <br>
beauty, mass, property, and justice pay for the  protection of that which <br>
they value.<br>
<p>
 (Typically, it's based on how similar the system is to those granting legal <br>
<i>&gt; protection.) If a conscious or even sentient system is unable to defend itself </i><br>
<i>&gt; from injury or destruction, do other conscious systems have an *obligation* to </i><br>
<i>&gt; protect it if they are able to?  Why or why not?</i><br>
<p>
I think to answer this question I would first need to figure out how to <br>
connect my own prefences to reality, if that can be done.<br>
<p>
<p>
Exovivo!<br>
