In a message dated 97-01-21 15:11:32 EST, you write:<br>

Actually, personality aside, Lyle has a good point, in some ways.  ...it's<br>
important to look at causes of, or evidence o,f inequality, even if it's are<br>
not what we want to hear. If it is a fact, it won't make a difference to me<br>
KNOWING it. It COULD make a difference to research and developement of<br>
intellegence.<br>
I see nothing bad about looking facts in the face, especially if we are going<br>
to make discoveries which would help us. <br>
<p>
The questionable part is whose facts you accept. Of course, if I do<br>
experiments and if the evidence does support women being somehow inferior<br>
(which I doubt, but then I am a woman so I would tend to look for evidence of<br>
OUR superiority) this would be useful information, as someone ( Anders?)said<br>
we transhumanists are seeking to overcome limits, genetic intelligence most<br>
of all.<br>
<p>
But, historically, entropically, the men who have asserted that genetics or<br>
bone, brain mass or racial/genetic/sexual status are the key to superiority-<br>
have little or no interest in changing the staus quo, or making use of the<br>
research; it is justification, rather than truthful, rational, inquiry.<br>
Most have been exposed as hoaxsters or delusional at best.<br>
<p>
I repeat : read Steven Jay Gould "Mismeasure of Man" for an<br>
amusing/depressing history of these kind of scientists.<br>
