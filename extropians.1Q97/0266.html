&lt;&lt; <br>
 While exploring Hugo de Garis's web site on brain building I came<br>
 across this rant on political correctness. He claims that genius<br>
 in an undeniably male trait. I would be interested if anyone has<br>
 a reasonable argument against his views &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I suggest reading "the Mismeasure of Man" by Steven Jay Gould, to explore<br>
certain biases and odd science conjectures around this area.<br>
<p>
For ever and ever the dominant group is trying to find scientific ( ie:<br>
irreversable) evidence as to why they (whichever's current, geographical,<br>
socially upperhand society it is, be it Gallic, Aryan, Greek, religious,male<br>
(ALMOST always male but whoever) are in that position. Skulls, medulas,<br>
teeth, neotony, brain weight have been measured, recorded meticuluosly,<br>
disected and judged according to race, sex, vocation,( brian weight turned<br>
out to embarrassing  since the main propigators of this myth left their<br>
brains behind for study) etc, etc....<br>
<p>
I tend to agree that men will inherently do better than women in certain<br>
areas, and are suited for certain tasks -and that they work much harder than<br>
women in general. But look,  there is so much repression (most of it -IMO due<br>
to simply our own victim mentality) towards women of intellect or talent,<br>
that it is hard to measure any objective standard.<br>
<p>
Women live longer, but does that make us better? Have we done studies to find<br>
out why this is purely genetic and cannot be "environmental" to prove our<br>
superiority? I am sure one could stack the evidence to show it statistically,<br>
 if you worked hard enough at it....<br>
<p>
-Nadia ( who is quite convinced she is a genius at art - and now has more<br>
than ever, reason to prove it by hard work)<br>
