<i>&gt; What is thought to be a major breakthrough/development in cancer therapy</i><br>
<i>&gt; has just been announced in the national Danish media. It should also have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been published in "Nature Medicine" a renounced medical journal.</i><br>
<p>
Is that a typo/mistranslation for "renowned", or a comment that this<br>
study is less than rigourous? :-)<br>
<p>
The other word you were groping for is "mitosis" (cell division).<br>
I won't correct all your spelling, but I did notice that you<br>
capitalized "German" but not "english".  Subliminal?<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks for the good news.  I remember hearing something about<br>
this a few months ago, but perhaps that was hype to get funding.<br>
Nice to know he actually got some results.  Does that mean that kids<br>
"infected" by this cure will be required /not/ to stay home from<br>
school so they can infect others?<br>
