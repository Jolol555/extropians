Wrong. Objectivists (students of Objectivism) are NOT altruists promoting<br>
selfishness. They are selfish people promoting rational self interest.<br>
<p>
"Selfish" people promoting altruism can not be properly classified as<br>
selfish. They may consider themselves as such, and mainstream society may<br>
call them "selfish", but they are far from it. <br>
<p>
There is no conflict of interest among rational people. On the contrary,<br>
there is a common interest in sharing ideas with other people. A rational<br>
scientist developing nanotechnology who just found out that another<br>
scientist next door has finally developed it for practical applications<br>
would not sneak over there and steal or destroy his work. A "selfish"<br>
person in the common context would. <br>
<p>
Two scientists who each have two halves of a puzzle completed would each<br>
mutually benefit from sharing the info with each other (not to mention how<br>
everyone else would benifit). Therefore, by working together, they are<br>
acting in their own best interest by doing so. If one of them decides to<br>
be "selfish" in the common context, they are not acting in their own best<br>
interest, and therefore are selfLESS, caring more about social recognition<br>
than self benefit.<br>

["]An analogous phenomenon exists with many Extropians.   We have a philosophy <br>
["]of individual self-improvement but we practice it only in the abstract, in <br>
["]the imagination, in philosophizing and principalizing and argument, but <br>
["]not in our daily present lives.   We rant against "deathism" and eat (some <br>
["]even smoke!) carcinogenic crap, drive and fly recklessly, stay overweight,<br>
["]and so on.  We value personal liberty, and promote privacy in the abstract, <br>
["]but haven't done much of anything to increase the privacy or liberty of<br>
["]our own lives.  We promote the ludicrously futile efforts of Browne the <br>
["]fringe whacko candidate but do little to find freedom in an unfree world.  <br>
["]We dream of immensely valuable future conditions but spend so much <br>
["]time with these future scenarios that we are doing less that will get<br>
["]ourselves to that future than the superstitious Mormon following a <br>
["]culturally evolved, basic healthy lifestyle.<br>
["]<br>
["]It's great dreaming of the future, but the future will actually belong to<br>
["]those who make it there.  Here are some steps I hope we can take to make it<br>
["]there:<br>
["]+ Don't rant on about the virtues of selfishness, you are contradcting<br>
["]yourself.  If you think selfishness is so great, then you should just be <br>
["]selfish and not let anybody else in on it.  (Unless of course you obtain <br>
["]joy by bothering people!).  the people who make it to the future will<br>
["]have cared immensely about themvelves, but they will also have pulled<br>
["]together, to solve the many public goods problems we need to solve, such <br>
["]as creating a hospitable climate (freedom for transhuman efforts in a<br>
["]Luddite world), getting each other out of cryonics at the other end, and <br>
["]so on.<br>
["]+ be more focused on particular areas of expertise where we can <br>
["]make a difference in the short term.  "Tend our own gardens" -- Voltaire.<br>
["]"Operate in the circle of influence" -- Covey.<br>
["]+ we need to be much more _short_ sighted, greedy and local when it<br>
["]comes to most of our lives.  We can live and proper in the present, <br>
["]creating capital with which to get to the future, in light of knowledge<br>
["]of our longer-term path and potential.  Don't obsess about the grass<br>
["]greener over the hill and starve in the pastures where we presently<br>
["]can graze, to get the energy needed to make it over the hill.<br>
["]<br>
["]Greed is good!  As is cooperation!  Lose the pathological <br>
["]combination of selfishness and future-obsession, but  keep<br>
["]in mind the lessons we have learned and the wonder awaiting us<br>
["]if we succeed in the here and now.<br>
