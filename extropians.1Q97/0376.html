<i>&gt;I found the following site run by the US Air Force (my old service) on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;study done by the Air War College on the US and the Air Forces future in</i><br>
<i>&gt;2025. They worked with futurists and scientists to project several</i><br>
<i>&gt;alternative futures. The one which most of us see as most likely and</i><br>
<i>&gt;most beneficial, they view as the most scary possiblity, which is rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;unsettling.</i><br>
<p>
Not suprising. Kind of reminds me of a snippet from this one episode of the<br>
Simpsons:<br>
<p>
Lawyer asks the question "What would the world be like without lawyers?"<br>
(Picture bubble shows him thinking about people holding hands around the<br>
world)<br>
Lawyer replies, "Ughh! Chilling!"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Lots of stuff there.  Could you tell what view you mean, and where it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; at the site?</i><br>
<i>&gt;The scenario that I associated with our goals, is one they described as</i><br>
<i>&gt;having exponential tech growth with "horrifying" increases in the power</i><br>
<i>&gt;of individuals and small groups.</i><br>
<p>
The text follows. You can find it at <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/2025/index.htm">http://www.au.af.mil/au/2025/index.htm</a><br>

<i>&gt;Alternate Futures </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Study participants used a forecasting technique known as alternate futures</i><br>
to help them envision an array of future worlds in which the U.S. must be<br>
able to survive and prosper in the year 2025. The 2025 team studied the<br>
works of respected futurists, then identified their own factors or drivers<br>
of change in the future. More than 100 individual drivers were considered.<br>
Ultimately the three drivers most relevant in terms of structuring the<br>
environment affecting U.S. security in the next century were chosen.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;American World View. The U.S. perspective of the world which determines</i><br>
its willingness and capability to interact with the rest of the world, and<br>
ranges from domestic to global. <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;TeK. The differential rate of growth, proliferation, leverage, and</i><br>
vitality of scientific knowledge and technical applications and their<br>
consequences. This driver ranges from constrained to exponential. When<br>
constrained, evolutionary changes are occurring and it is possible for<br>
nations or groups to preserve technological monopolies and advantages. When<br>
change is exponential, revolutionary technological changes are possible and<br>
nations or groups are unable to preserve technological leverage, monopolies<br>
and advantages.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;World Power Grid. The generation (sources -- social, political, economic,</i><br>
military, etc.), transmission (directions, resistance, speed), distribution<br>
(number and types of actors) and control (influence, leverage) of power<br>
throughout the world. This driver ranges from concentrated to dispersed.<br>
The world power grid is concentrated when a few actors have the means or<br>
will to influence others and dispersed when many actors can effectively<br>
influence world events.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The 2025 team used the creative but disciplined alternate futures</i><br>
procedure to describe various plausible future worlds, each separate and<br>
distinct, and each offering different security and planning challenges. In<br>
the first world, the U.S.'s military might is constrained by many world<br>
players with other forms of power. A second world depicts the extreme<br>
impacts of a future dominated by multinational corporate giants. A third<br>
world is a scary future in which information and biogenetic technology is<br>
dispersed, giving individuals and small groups untold power. In a fourth<br>
world, the U.S. loses its status as a superpower to an Asian colossus. A<br>
fifth future envisions a world marked by fundamental changes in the social<br>
structure, environment and the international security system, making it<br>
difficult for the United States to determine how best to exert its power<br>
and influence. The final world depicts how a major conflict in 2015 could<br>
shape events in 2025.<br>
