<i>        &gt;Stop with the atheist hyperbole.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No. Atheist hyperbole has a positive value, at least for me, in fact it's the  <br>
meaning of life, if it's not 42.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Not everyone who disagrees with you is a slavering religious fanatic.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have never, ever, said that about you or any member of this list or even  <br>
come close to doing so.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You do not wish any goal to have inherently positive value, because         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;then you would be free to assign positive value to any goals you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;chose.</i><br>
          <br>
          <br>
Yes, although I would assign my own values no matter what the Universe thinks, <br>
because unlike violating a natural law, it's possible even easy to do so.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If no goal has positive value, but you assign goals positive value,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you would simply be wrong.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If I am an Engineer and I assign the wrong strength value to steel then my <br>
bridge will collapse, if I am "wrong" when I assign a positive value to a <br>
goal what collapses?<br>
<p>
By the way for some reason you left out the most vital word of all,  <br>
"inherently".<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Try translating your proposal into practical terms. You are saying:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"I hope that there's no way to walk across the room, because then I        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;am free to assign to my actions whatever walk-across-the-room-utility        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;values I choose."  Presumably you will choose to assign a high value,    </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in terms of getting across the room, to blowing your nose. Now, in        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;point of fact, blowing your nose will not help  you get across the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;room.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're confusing "should not" with "could not". There is no penalty for <br>
breaking a law of Physics, you just can't do it, when you talk about laws <br>
concerning values and ethics you can and often do break these laws, the laws <br>
just say you should not. Exactly why you should not is unclear.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;John K Clark wants there to be no meaning to Life so he can assign         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;high value to, say, exploring the galaxy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And he will want to assign high value to exploring the galaxy        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;because he thinks it will be fun.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True beyond the slightest doubt, and if it's fun I will do it and I don't <br>
feel the slightest need to justify it further. In a similar way, if I stick <br>
my hand in a fire I will try to pull it out as fast as I can because it's <br>
painful, and I don't need to make calculations based on the meaning of life <br>
to figure out that it hurts. If the meaning of life tells me to forget about <br>
the galaxy and just stay home and barbecue my hand then the meaning of life  <br>
can lump it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And he thinks it will be fun, because evolution says it will be fun.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;So evolution is choosing John K Clark's goals for him, in the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;absence of any real meaning to the  Universe.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
1)I am the one doing the choosing if I have free will.  <br>
2)I have free will if I can not predict what I will do next. <br>
3)I am the doing the choosing.<br>
<p>
Even if I had the meaning of life in my pocket I would still do things <br>
because of cause and effect OR I would not. When things happen for no reason <br>
we call them random.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In formal ethical terms, no Meaning means - by  definition - </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Oh no! "Meaning means - by definition", I count 3 nested circular logic <br>
loops, and to make it worse you're talking about the MEANING of life. I am <br>
not playing games and I am not engaging in sophistry, this is vitally <br>
important. If you want even the slightest chance of having "What is the <br>
meaning of Life?" to be anything but pure gibberish then these problems must <br>
be addressed. Personally I think there is very little chance of anyone ever  <br>
doing this, it is and always will be nonsense.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;John K Clark is assuming that we know for *sure* that all goals have       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;zero inherent value;</i><br>
<p>
OK<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;thus no Interim goals.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Once more I urge you to examine that all important word "inherent".                    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Thus there is no conceivable reason for John K Clark wanting to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;assign meaning to anything, which will not trace its roots to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;evolution. Either John K Clark will  not know this, or he will know        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;this and will deliberately lie to himself.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is yet a third possibility, John K Clark knows this and John K Clark <br>
does not care. How would things be one bit different if you did know the <br>
meaning of life? If you follow the goals chosen by the meaning of life and <br>
are miserable and I follow whatever goal that strikes my fancy and am happy, <br>
in what sense am I "wrong"?                <br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By contrast, suppose the Meaning of Life is "new  ideas".  I can        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;discard all externally imposed goals, deduce that the Meaning is        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"new ideas", and set out, completely free from all coercion, to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;explore the Galaxy  in search of new ideas.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You don't want the meaning of life, you want a way to always know what is the <br>
best way to maximize value, well I don't blame you, I want that too, it's <br>
called infinite intelligence.<br>
<p>
If the meaning of life was X rather than Y , how would the world be any <br>
different? You have already indicated that something as simple as being happy <br>
is not the meaning of life, if so then why would I want to go in that <br>
direction? Learning new stuff makes me happy, if that's the meaning of life <br>
then fine, if it's  something else or it has no meaning I intend to continue <br>
doing what makes me happy regardless.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You'll choose your own meaning?  By what criterion? Life?  Joy?        </i><br>
<i>        &gt; Laughter? But they won't be meaningful. In  actual fact, they </i><br>
<i>        &gt;won't be meaningful.  So you'll be lying to yourself.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Laughter would certainly be meaningful TO ME and I wouldn't need to prove it  <br>
to myself any more than I need to prove to myself that I'm conscious. <br>
Some things are more powerful than proof, if you have a proof that I am not <br>
conscious then there is an error in your proof, If there is no error in your <br>
proof then there is a flaw in the laws of logic, and if the universe says<br>
that my joy is not important then the universe is wrong and I am right.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As you point out, worshipping God is of no conceivable  value to the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Universe, once viewed from the proper perspective.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Worshipping God has zero value to me, the Universe is free to form its own <br>
opinion.       <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you can assign an absolute (non-probabilistic) positive value to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anything, without deluding yourself or being motivated by externally        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;imposed goals, that is the Meaning of Life.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Then a proton is the Meaning of Life. I'm not being glib, if you want a value <br>
that is universal then look to electrical charge, however universality is <br>
overrated, I am more interested in things that have value locally, like my <br>
happiness.<br>
               <br>
