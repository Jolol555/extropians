Anders,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This depends on how you want to distribute energy (and heat dissipation)</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your system. If the feedstock is inert, then the nanites will have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use energy to reform it into something different on site, and will cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributed heating and problems of distributing energy. If you store high</i><br>
<i>&gt; enthalpy parts in the cube, then they can mainly be used "off the shelf"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the energy dissipation will have to occur in the recycling system.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good point.  I was aware of the energy distribution <br>
problem when it comes time to recycle the material, but when I made my<br>
post, I was looking at the recycling center as essentially a garbage <br>
dump where stuff is stored until it is needed.<br>
<p>
In any case, not only does my proposal simply trade one problem for<br>
another, but in light of the throughput that would be expected in the<br>
recycling area, I don't think what I brought up would even apply.<br>
