What is thought to be a major breakthrough/development in cancer therapy<br>
has just been announced in the national Danish media. It should also have<br>
been published in "Nature Medicine" a renounced medical journal.<br>
<p>
An international/Danish research group working for the Danish cancer<br>
society, headed by German scientist Michael Strauss, has removed cancer<br>
cells ranging from 05 - 1 cm in size in rats. They dissapeared in the<br>
course of 10 - 12 days.<br>
<p>
They are ready to start testing on humans, and they are certain they can<br>
cure tumors and pretty shure it will work on methastasis (Hope thats the<br>
right english word, can't find it in my dictionary.) It won't work on<br>
leuchemia or cancer in the lymphytic system.<br>
<p>
The method is that the take a common cold virus and encode it with 2 genes<br>
that stops the cell (darn another english word i can't remember)<br>
multiplying/splitting? The virus is used as a carrier for the gene.<br>
<p>
Popularly explained (wich was all they did) the reprogram the cancer cell<br>
to a more normal state where it will destroy itself like normal cells.<br>
<p>
Perhaps some of you guys with more medical knowledge can check out the<br>
magazine. It sounds like a variety of the same process can be used in<br>
stopping ageing?<br>
<p>
They figure it will be between 7-10 years before it will become common<br>
practice on humans.<br>
