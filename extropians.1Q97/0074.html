Don't give credit for that to Christianity! That was the Greek influence,<br>
specifically Neoplatonism. Christianity absorbed that but didn't creat it.<br>
If Christianity hadn't been around, we don't know what outlook might have<br>
arisen instead. Possibly something which, overall, would have encourage<br>
science and reason more strongly (rather than killing it for a millennium).<br>
