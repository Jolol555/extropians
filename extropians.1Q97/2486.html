<i>        &gt;I think John's original definition referred to "beings" with free        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;will, and he explained that before asking whether a program had free        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;will we should first ask if it is a being, which I gather would        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;imply consciousness at a minimum.  </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Actually I think it would imply consciousness at a maximum. I like my  <br>
definition of free will, but I don't have a definition for consciousness <br>
that's worth a damn, even though I experience it. Also, unlike free will, <br>
I don't have a sure fire test for it, The Turing Test is the best anybody has <br>
come up with, it's not perfect but it's all we have. It's all we'll ever have <br>
I think.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I also am not clear on how to define what it means to make a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;prediction.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
I ask the computer program: "Suppose you decided to search for the <br>
smallest even number greater than 4 that is not the sum of two primes  <br>
(ignoring 1 and 2) and then stop. Would you ever stop?"<br>
<p>
Not only will the computer program be unable to answer that question but <br>
I can't either, nobody can.<br>
<p>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;The program runs a simulation of itself where X happens, and comes         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;up with the result, which it reports (perhaps with a probabilistic         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;component). Now we might say that this is not an accurate prediction,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;because if X then actually does happen, the program won't be in the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;state it thought it was going to be in when it made the prediction,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;simply by virtue of having made the prediction.  </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Yes, that is another problem. For the mind to totally understand itself it  <br>
must form a perfect internal model of itself, but that is impossible because  <br>
the brain as a whole must have more members than the part that is just the  <br>
model.       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But I don't think this is fair to the program.  It was asked to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;predict what it would do when X happened.  </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
It's not important if an outside party asks us to make a prediction, because <br>
we constantly ask ourselves the question "What am I going to do next?". <br>
The answer we receive is often wrong, we change our mind and surprise <br>
ourselves, or the answer we receive is "I don't know I'll have to think about <br>
it". We know for sure what we're going to do when we do it, and not before.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You could ask it this: "What would you do if X happens after your         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;memory has been reset to the state it was in before I asked this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;question?" In that case the program  could accurately and reliably         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;predict its behavior. </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
But it would still take the computer 10 minutes to figure out what it will do <br>
10 minutes from now. Besides, if its memory is erased what's the point?<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In principle, a person with access to an accurate neural-level        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;description of his brain could do so as well [...] Would people's         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ability to answer such questions imply that they don't have free         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;will? </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
The electronic computer is much faster than my old steam powered biological <br>
brain, so it figures out in 10 seconds what I'm going to do in 10 minutes, <br>
but if the computer then tells me of it's prediction about me, and my  <br>
personality is such that out of pure meanness I always do the opposite of  <br>
what somebody tells me to do, then the prediction is wrong.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do we really want to rely on the fact that the memory of questions         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;changes the state of the system to show that it has free will?</i><br>
             <br>
<p>
I think we do, because we're the one asking ourselves the questions.<br>
