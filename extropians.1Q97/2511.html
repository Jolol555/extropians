Several of you have weighed in with thoughtful comments on this topic, and<br>
I've enjoyed learning about how astrophysics might combine with game theory<br>
to encourage mega-engineering projects--and *incredible* parties!<br>
<p>
Several parties have mentioned that the relevant Schelling point(s) might lie<br>
not in physical space but rather in the electromagnetic spectrum.  That makes<br>
a lot a sense, on reflection.  Why cart our meat (or, more aptly, silicon) to<br>
the party when we can simply attend at a distance, virtually?  Granted that C<br>
would still hinder our repartee, but the same damned limit would also make<br>
personal meetings extraordinarily burdensome.  (Sure, relativistic effects<br>
would cut the apparent commute, but who wants to return to homebodies who've<br>
aged at hugely disparate rates?)<br>
<p>
Assuming that we seek electromagnetic Schelling points, would we really aim<br>
at something (as I believe Michael Lorrey suggested) in the 21 cm band?  I'd<br>
like to hear more of the reasoning behind that choice.  Doesn't it rely on a<br>
rather parochial notion of appropriate biologies?  <br>
<p>
Were I an alien trying to contact scattered friends, I think I'd set up a<br>
sort of lighthouse that, at freakishly regular intervals, would blast out<br>
discrete bursts of EM radiation.  Then I would, in between or next to the<br>
bursts, plug in my message to the universe:  "Partyline in the 10 cm band!<br>
 Just dial 1-900...."<br>
<p>
Sounds kinda' like a pulsar, eh?  I wonder if anyone has listened closely to<br>
the spaces *between* their signals.  <br>
<p>
