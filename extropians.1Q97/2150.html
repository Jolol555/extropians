As long as macroscopic events are the result of atomic motions, <br>
it doesn't matter whether atomic motions are deterministic or not.  <br>
(a) Suppose they are:  each atom follows a path prescribed for it by a <br>
differential equation, and the result of all such motions is the world <br>
we experience.  <br>
(b) Suppose they are not:  atoms (sometimes) move discontinuously <br>
and unpredictably, and the result of all such motions is the world <br>
we experience.  <br>
It amounts to the same thing either way.  Our lives are the result of <br>
atomic motions of some kind, whether those motions are continuous <br>
or not.  <br>
<p>
In other words, introducing randomness doesn't really change the <br>
situation.  Atoms still do whatever they do, independently of us.  <br>
They lead, we follow.  The only way to avoid this conclusion is <br>
to go to the root of the problem, and get rid of the assumption that <br>
the macroscopic world is the "result" of atomic motions.  <br>
<p>
Atomic events are not separate from or prior to large-scale events.     <br>
<p>
When I do something, the whole ensemble of atoms which constitute <br>
my body (and other atoms in the air, etc) move accordingly.  Their <br>
movements are not separate from my action;  their movements are <br>
the embodiment of my action.  They don't lead me;  I lead them.  <br>
Causality operates from the top down, not from the bottom up.  <br>
This does not contradict the fact that each atom follows a path <br>
prescribed by the laws of physics.  The atoms do what they have to do, <br>
given the forces acting on them.  It's just that the forces which act <br>
on the atoms are part of a large-scale pattern.  <br>
<p>
This also applies to animals, and even to machines.  Your car doesn't <br>
travel down the road because all of its atoms happen to be moving in <br>
that direction!  It's the other way around:  the car moves, and the atoms <br>
move with it.  <br>
<p>
Once you get that straightened out, the "problem" disappears.  <br>
