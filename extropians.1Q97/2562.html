     The expected return on equity capital is possibly the most<br>
     important driving factor in asset allocation decisions. Yet,<br>
     the long-term estimates we typically use are derived from<br>
     U.S. data only. There are reasons to suspect, however, that<br>
     these estimates of return on capital are subject to<br>
     survivorship, as the United States is arguably the most<br>
     successful capitalist system in the world; most other<br>
     countries have been plagued by political upheaval, war, and<br>
     financial crises. The purpose of this paper is to provide<br>
     estimates of return on capital from long-term histories for<br>
     world equity markets. By putting together a variety of<br>
     sources, we collected a database of capital appreciation<br>
     indexes for 39 markets with histories going as far back as<br>
     the 1920s. Our results are striking. We find that the United<br>
     States has by far the highest uninterrupted real rate of<br>
     appreciation of all countries, at about 5 percent annually.<br>
     For other countries, the median real appreciation rate is<br>
     about 1.5 percent. The high return premium obtained for U.S.<br>
     equities therefore appears to be the exception rather than<br>
     the rule. Our global databases also allow us to reconstruct<br>
     monthly real and dollar-valued capital appreciation indices<br>
     for global markets, providing further evidence on the<br>
     benefits of international diversification.<br>
