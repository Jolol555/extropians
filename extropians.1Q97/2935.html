<i>&gt; From:          Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lcrocker@calweb.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The standard Libertarian (and Republican) belief is that free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; market economies inherently favor the smartest, hardest working</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; entrepreneurs and best products.  This is true.  But they also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hold a belief that this principle causes free market economies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be inherently stable and fair.  This is not true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you have such bizarre ideas about what a free market is, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; wonder you have reservations.  Free markets don't encourage the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; products, and never have.  They encourage the economically most</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient products.</i><br>
<p>
It was not a complete description.  I make no appologies for that<br>
since covering all the bases would have turned a paragraph into a<br>
documentary.  To do so was not necessary to the point I was making. I<br>
simply mentioned the aspects of Libertarian belief that I happened to <br>
be addressing.  There is much more to Libertarian ideology, and free <br>
markets are governed by many interacting forces.  I suspect that most <br>
people reading this thread don't need to have either of those things <br>
explained to them.  If I say that a car is red, that does not mean <br>
that "red" is the entirety of my understanding about the car.  If you <br>
are not capable of mentally fleshing out the details enough to <br>
prevent imagining that I have "bizarre ideas about what a free market <br>
is", then that is your deficiency, not mine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Stable" is exactly what a free market isn't--and why it's superior</i><br>
<i>&gt; to any possible planned market.  Stability is stagnation.  Stability</i><br>
<i>&gt; is death.</i><br>
<p>
By "stable" I only mean that it remains productive, as opposed to<br>
grinding to a halt or exploding in a conflict.  I did not mean to <br>
imply that it is unchanging.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ......  "Fair" is a moral judgment, and since we</i><br>
<i>&gt; agoriarchists define the free market as the consequence of the moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle that coercive force is never justified to transfer</i><br>
<i>&gt; property, it is the only system that can be moral by definition.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have some other definition of "fair", say, the most egalitarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; in result, or the least random in result, or the highest correlation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of effort with reward, then some system other than the free market</i><br>
<i>&gt; might have that property, but it will require coercion and will</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely be less productive than a free market. </i><br>
<p>
"Highest correlation of effort with reward" is something I would <br>
include in the definition of "fair".  Might also add some degree of <br>
equality of opportunity.<br>
<p>
Lack of coercion is a desireable ideal, but it is not the feature<br>
that makes free markets successful. It is the promise of reaping some<br>
reward in return for your productivity.  Without a reasonable<br>
correlation of effort with reward, and without a reasonable<br>
opportunity for success, then the incentive to produce disappears.<br>
Without those two elements, you are left with something that is no<br>
more productive than pure socialism.  Perhaps even worse since even<br>
coercion is more effective than no incentive at all.<br>
<p>
Are you arguing that these ideas, whether you include them in the<br>
definition of "fair" or not, are not an integral part of the<br>
Libertian ideal of a free market economy?  It is because of these<br>
elements that capitilism has enjoyed such success.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Those who control great wealth can win even when market dynamics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; should have made it otherwise.  Likewise, those who control little</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wealth will often not see rewards that reflect their level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; prodictivity, thus diminishing the incentive to be productive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a common arguent, but plainly at odds with the evidence.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; the one time in history when the US had about the freest market (in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the late 1800s), Standard Oil used every dirty trick in the book--</i><br>
<p>
Good example.  I'm sure further research would reveal others.  But my<br>
point was simply that there are potential scenarios by which a free<br>
market economy can produce less than optimal, or even<br>
counterproductive results (like inferior products, high prices,<br>
survival of the fattist instead of the fittest, etc.)  I'm not<br>
arguing that such things happen in every possible case.  Are you <br>
arguing that they don't happen at all?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ......  Before you use "monopolies" as an example if market</i><br>
<i>&gt; failure, name one.  Just one. One single example if a free-market</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopoly taking advantage of its position to people's detriment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't--it's a myth.</i><br>
<p>
I haven't mentioned monopolies and wasn't planning to.  If I happen <br>
accross a good example I'll be sure to mention it.  For now you seem <br>
to be arguing with yourself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Capitalism is good, but it is not perfect.  We can address the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; imperfections and create an economy that works, or we can deny the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; imperfections and create one that does not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As soon as you define "perfect" and "working", I'll be able to argue</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationally.  Until you do, your words are meaningless.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; defined my terms for you: a free market is the consequence of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle that coercive force is /never/ justified to take property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now that principle will have certain consequences about which we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationally argue.  But you must name them precisely and define them</i><br>
<i>&gt; objectively--stop using words like "fair", "just", or "good" until</i><br>
<i>&gt; you tell me what they mean.</i><br>
<p>
I really don't mind sincere requests for clarification, but this<br>
isn't it and I'll use any words I damn well please.  I could pester<br>
you to define the words that you have used.  Words like "justified",<br>
"detriment" and "moral".  We could go back and forth for weeks<br>
nitpicking over minutia.  But it would serve no useful purpose.   If <br>
my ideas had been too vaguely described for you to understand them, I <br>
doubt they would have grabbed your attention enough for you to take <br>
the time to reply at such length.<br>
<p>
                                        Peace,<br>
                                        William Kitchen<br>
