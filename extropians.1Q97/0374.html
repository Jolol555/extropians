<i>&gt; Oh, you hardly need to upload to do that. People have been doing that for</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of years. I prefer Doubting myself. Not only is it more fun, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; also more productive of knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
You haven't Doubted enough if your world is so secure that you don't<br>
care to know the *real* truth.  When was the last time you confronted a<br>
Hard Problem... something so completely and blankly unanswerable that<br>
you couldn't even touch it?  The Meaning of Life?  The First Cause? <br>
Conscious experience?  I could be wrong, oh Eric Watt Forste, but from<br>
what you have said your world is far too... not certain... *solid*.  You<br>
blithely speak of answering the First Cause with the Anthropic Principle<br>
and say life has "many" meanings if asked why you get out of bed in the<br>
morning.<br>
<p>
Doubting is only *mere* fun when you doubt only the deep surface issues<br>
like political conflicts and your emotional motivations.  When your<br>
Doubting has reduced your entire goal system to a shambles, so that you<br>
cannot even walk across a room without wondering why, you will take<br>
Doubt a bit more seriously.<br>
<p>
Doubt is fun.  And productive of knowledge.  And morally pure beyond any<br>
other motivation.  Love and hate and honor and greed have all produced<br>
boundless misery in their times, but science and smartness and the<br>
search for truth have ultimately built everything that lasts.  For<br>
billions of years life came and went upon the Earth without impinging on<br>
the slightest upon the rest of the Universe; then humanity awoke and<br>
with their intelligence set foot upon the Moon and now joke offhandedly<br>
of stellifying Jupiter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I just want to Know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, you hardly need to upload to do that. People have been doing that for</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of years. I prefer Doubting myself. Not only is it more fun, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; also more productive of knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
I want the Final Answers.  The burning search for that takes precedence<br>
over everything else.  What can I do without the Truth?  How can I know<br>
what I'm doing or why I should be doing it without the Truth?  Doubting<br>
isn't just a hobby or even just a way of life.  It is an action taken<br>
with a specific and most final goal in mind:  To Know everything that<br>
matters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I'm also afraid that I simply *must* quibble with your implicit contention</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Knowledge is something non-physical.)</i><br>
<p>
What is Knowledge?  I don't know.  Haven't a clue.  And it sure does<br>
make things difficult not to have a clue about something like that. <br>
What is "physical"?  What is "non-physical"?  Should I be answering your<br>
question or doing something else?  Is the asking of your question<br>
worthwhile of itself?  Is the answer worthwhile?  Is either act real?  I<br>
don't know.  But I damn well intend to find out once and for all.<br>
<p>
Why is it necessary to upload to find the Final Answers?  Because humans<br>
are too damn stupid to figure out the Truth.  We don't have enough<br>
neurons.  We're too easily distracted.  We don't live long enough or<br>
think fast enough.  The Answers are incompatible with our cognitive<br>
architectures and we don't have enough self-knowledge to even say *how*<br>
our cognitive architectures interfere with our perceptions, much less<br>
rebuild them accordingly.<br>
<p>
We are not fully self-conscious.  We are no more captains of our souls<br>
than we are telekinetic masters of the atoms which trace them. <br>
Uploading will solve that.  And so will the Singularity.  I have faith<br>
in neither, but I am driven towards them - as much as a countersphexist<br>
can ever be driven towards anything.<br>
<p>
You can have the galaxy.  One whole mess of atoms.  What good will it do<br>
you?  Why should I care about anything physical but unconscious?  Why<br>
are two billion identical copies of me better than one?  Why is<br>
travelling a billion lightyears more significant than moving an inch? <br>
Or shifting stars more significant than tossing rocks?  The only thing<br>
that matters is the mind, and it is the mind which uploading shall<br>
kindle and Singularity shall ignite.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I'm also afraid that I simply *must* quibble with your implicit contention</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Knowledge is something non-physical.)</i><br>
<p>
Is the mind "non-physical"?  To the extent of my knowledge, almost<br>
certainly not... but I don't know.  And I intend to find out.<br>
