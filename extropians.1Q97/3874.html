It is already happening, and it happens at its own pace.  For us to try<br>
and mold it would be like a cell trying to organise the body of which it<br>
is a part- ridiculous.  We bring it about by simply living our lives<br>
fully.<br>
<p>
Usenet is the beginnings of something like a 'brain' for the world, I<br>
often think.  People sharing memes and being infected by them.  Over<br>
time, memes that have been thoroughly spread and tested in argument this<br>
way are more likely to be true and useful.  <br>
<p>
And there may be some holistic or emergent effect that we won't<br>
understand (at least not initially, or not until its effects come within<br>
our range of cognition).<br>
