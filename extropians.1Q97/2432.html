<p>
True.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The only question is whether the reasons are traceable to reason or         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;evolution.  You say that if traceable to reason, they are "imposed";         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;if to evolution, they are "free".  I say exactly the reverse.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
For the purposes of this argument it doesn't matter a bit if reason or <br>
Evolution CAUSED you to act in a certain way, in both cases they are  <br>
"imposed". If I make a logical decision, that means that out of an infinite <br>
number of choices I narrowed things down to one particular action. When <br>
somebody tells me that my choice was smart, logical, reasonable, that I had <br>
reasons (causes) for doing what I did, I am not embarrassed or insulted, <br>
I am flattered. <br>
<p>
When somebody tells me that my choice was stupid, illogical, unreasonable,  <br>
that I had no reasons (no causes) for doing what I did, I am embarrassed and  <br>
insulted, I am most certainly not flattered. <br>
          <br>

          <br>
<p>
So, you have chosen to identify with evolution imposed reason. I don't wish  <br>
to insult you so let me say that I think your choice is reasonable, there  <br>
were reasons, causes, for you to make that decision. I'm not sure if the <br>
causes were in your genes or your environment and it doesn't matter, they're <br>
still causes.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What I decide to do, is me. [...] You appear to have chosen to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;identify with your heart.  What you want to do, is you.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You decide to do things you don't want to do??? Why do you do them? <br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't want my emotions assigning positive value to things that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;aren't really worth anything.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
"Want" is an emotion. You don't "want" your emotions assigning positive value  <br>
to things, because that would make you sad, or at least, you think it would  <br>
make you sad. You think the idea of maximizing intrinsic value (whatever that <br>
is) will make you happy, while maximizing subjective value will not.<br>
