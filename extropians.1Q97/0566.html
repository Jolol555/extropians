<i>&gt; I mean, the same chemicals that composed the "primordial soup" from which</i><br>
<i>&gt; life arose on this planet, and perhaps elsewhere, would probably still be</i><br>
<i>&gt; around today whether life arose or not. WHAT "SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE" IS THERE</i><br>
<i>&gt; FOR THE CHEMICALS TO FORM INCREASINGLY COMPLEX PATTERNS?</i><br>
<p>
Because complexity does things, and in order to do things, you need<br>
complexity, and you have to do things in order to survive and reproduce.<br>
<p>
Relevant to this debate is the Ancestor ALife program.  It is relevant<br>
because it is known, absolutely, what the laws of physics were.  They<br>
did not include any mysterious forces.  The run began with a single<br>
self-reproducing and random-error-making string of code called the<br>
"Ancestor", 80 characters long.  Soon the Ancestor was replaced by a<br>
hardier piece of code 79 characters long.  (No artificial drive towards<br>
complexity here, folks - the short pieces of code survived better<br>
because they took less time to execute!)  Then parasites evolved which<br>
could be much shorter by "hijacking" the reproductive process of other<br>
parasites.  Then hyper-parasites that preyed on the parasites.  Then<br>
defenses against parasites and hyper-parasites.  And so on and so on...<br>
<p>
I don't believe that multi-cellular life evolved at any point, although<br>
there was a point where two pieces of code would cooperate, which was<br>
certainly a start.  The point is that you have to do things to survive,<br>
and you have to have complexity to do things.<br>
<p>
No mysterious force has been shown to be necessary.  Please try again.<br>
