Jamal, I respect your attempt to support a libertarian form of socialism,<br>
and I have no doubt that such a thing would work (to a certain extent -<br>
see below) in a self-selected society, perhaps in space colonies in the<br>
future.  <br>
<p>
But I think you have some really wacky ideas about capitalism (at least<br>
so far as modern procapitalists would see it)!  All the marks of what<br>
you call capitalism are marks of mercantilism, the union of business and<br>
state interests. This is not capitalism as anarcho-capitalists and most<br>
other procapitalists see it.  Our modern Western society is mixed<br>
mercantilist/capitalist.<br>
<p>
Capitalism in the modern procapitalist sense means: rule of law (natural<br>
law, meaning law centred around the principles of individualism - right<br>
to life, liberty and property), functioning markets and a functioning<br>
price system. It is a pure socialist myth that this kind of system<br>
(which has never been fully implemented anywhere in the world, but<br>
is, so to speak threaded through the mercantilist economy we have today,<br>
and is responsible for whatever progress and happiness we enjoy) leads<br>
naturally to monopoly. Monopoly, the natural business mode of mercantilism,<br>
can only arise from the kind of collusion between business and government<br>
that is *expressly forbidden* by the concept  'rule of law'. Mercantilism,<br>
after a brief retreat during the 19th century, has reasserted itself<br>
precisely because of *lack*of observation of the principle 'rule of law'.<br>
<p>
You must understand that when someone gets a job that is a 'win' for<br>
them, OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT.  You may argue that in certain<br>
circumstances they 'have no choice'.  True, in a sense, but then, as we<br>
procapitalists see it, the*less* capitalism there is around, the*less*<br>
choice they will have.  Examples of exploitation in Third World<br>
countries are the result  of *lack* of capitalism (most Third World<br>
countries have been more or less socialist/mercantilist since their<br>
independence - true or false?).<br>
<p>
Fascism is an extreme form of mercantilism, not of capitalism.  Again,<br>
the sorts of things fascists indulge in are expressly forbidden by the<br>
'rule of law' principle, therefore they are not capitalist as modern<br>
procapitalists understand capitalism.<br>
<p>
I might add that anarcho-capitalists are such because they believe that<br>
their system would result in a better observation of the rule of law<br>
than state-monopoly-based systems.<br>
<p>
Finally, it is highly doubtful whether even a libertarian form of<br>
socialism would result in the kind of technological progress that<br>
capitalism (or rather, the relative degree of capitalism we see around<br>
us) results in.  Without a functioning market and price system, it is<br>
impossible to discover whether or not anything that is produced is (to<br>
bastardize a bit of Marxist jargon) 'socially necessary'.  This<br>
impossibility means that any attempt to centrally control an economy is<br>
doomed to produce stagnation (and lesser attempts to centrally control<br>
produce lesser amounts of stagnation, as in most Western societies), but<br>
it poses an equally strong challenge to any form of syndicalism or<br>
left-anarchy. I am heavily condensing an argument known as the 'economic<br>
calculation' argument (or 'problem'), which is well known to procapitalist<br>
economists, who have long predicted that socialist economies would<br>
collapse (as indeed they did, and will continue to do).  Check out a<br>
book written by<br>
an ex- Marxist, David Ramsay Steele, called "From Marx to Mises: Post-<br>
Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation.",<br>
1992, Open Court publishing.  Mr Steele goes into some detail re.<br>
anarcho-syndicalism and similar ideas.<br>
<p>
As an ex-socialist myself, I have strong sympathies with the possibility<br>
of consenting socialism.  But I believe it is only possible within a<br>
'rule of law' framework.  If you want to be a libertarian socialist, you<br>
must first be a libertarian.<br>
<p>
Good luck!<br>
