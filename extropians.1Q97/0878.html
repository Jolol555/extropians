I suppose this is Psychology.  It's no longer about Netiquette...<br>

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ur-* (UnReasoning-*?).<br>
At any rate, I totally agree with your summary of how a reasonable<br>
person thinks and feels, but I'm not certain that you've grasped the<br>
way in which persons who "follow their heart" make decisions.<br>
<p>
One may well be leading with the "head," even when acknowledging<br>
irrational values and acquiescing to these unjustified goals.  On the<br>
other hand, a person might still be following their heart when they<br>
get up and go to work, not because they realize it's more important<br>
than sleeping in, but because they "feel" that's what they should do.<br>
<p>
The difference is this:  Following your head means you're CONSCIOUS of<br>
when you're going for the more rationally justified goal, whereas<br>
following your heart allows you to remain UNCONSCIOUS of this funda-<br>
mental distinction.  Note how different that is from simply eschewing<br>
logic alltogether, or using logic and then rejecting its conclusions.<br>
Rather, the "heart" thinker does his/her reasoning underground,<br>
unconscious of the complex processes which give rise to their<br>
conclusions.  This person may be extremely intelligent, more keen at<br>
the actual process of reasoning than you and I put together, but they<br>
won't be able to articulate it or acknowledge it, because they're not<br>
actually aware of what's going on inside their head.<br>
<p>
Thus, your ideas describe a reasonable thinker perfectly, but are <br>
totally inapplicable for someone who makes important decisions through<br>
intuition, and lives a life "unfettered" by tedious analysis.  They see<br>
no distinction between any of their goals, because their motives are<br>
always the same:  "I feel like I should do this."  Whether the<br>
conclusion is rationally justified or primally motivated, they're still<br>
doing what they "feel" they should do.  They get out of bed in the<br>
morning because they feel like they should, not because they're being<br>
rational.<br>
<p>
This is not to suggest that they're necessarily unintelligent,<br>
but rather never conscious of their decision-making process long enough<br>
to find those distinctions which are so apparent to us "head" people.<br>
Unaware of the process by which they arrive at their conclusions, they<br>
seem to be "feeling" their way through every situation.  Thus, they<br>
"follow their heart."<br>
