Relativity gets our way, unfortunately.  Perhaps you've heard of the<br>
famous experiment where two atomic clocks are perfectly synchronized,<br>
then you take one of them in a jet and fly a good distance at<br>
some mach coefficient, only to land and find that the two clocks are<br>
minutes off?<br>
<p>
To make this work to the accuracy you'd like, we'd have to pick an<br>
official central reference point, universally declared to be the<br>
location and time by which to compare all other reference frames moving<br>
at whatever speed in relation to our magic focus.<br>
<p>
And where would you have this spot?  The earth's spinning around the<br>
sun, the sun is whirling off into space; and I don't even want to<br>
THINK about what space is doing.  ;)<br>
<p>
All of this is pretty insignificant when you talk about our day to day<br>
lives. The gross approximations we use for time zones are perfectly<br>
acceptable for keeping schedules and business meetings in New York while<br>
video-conferencing in Los Angeles, but when you're talking about the<br>
precision of atomic clocks, it starts to matter.<br>
<p>
Really, I don't see a purpose for a new calendar or timing system.  I<br>
mean, sure, you can call the measuring system outdated, but you're<br>
really not making much of a statement by trying to switch units, IMHO.<br>
