That is a reasonable theory, very logical, but as in History that's not <br>
enough to prove it's true. In spite of this the idea seemed so "right" that <br>
until recently nearly  everybody thought it must be true; then the fossil <br>
record proved that it's completely wrong. <br>
<p>
Lucy lived 3 and a half million years ago, she could walk upright as well as <br>
you or me, in fact from the neck down was very similar to modern people, <br>
and yet, her brain was only slightly larger than a chimpanzee. The huge <br>
increase in brain size came AFTER bipedalism developed and after a hand <br>
evolved that could perform complex movement. It would seem much more logical <br>
if a big brain came first, but that's not what happened and nobody <br>
understands why.<br>

I agree, that never made much sense to me, if anything it seems that <br>
bipedalism would do better in a dense jungle that a open savanna, but if the <br>
savanna theory is wrong that doesn't mean that the Aquatic Ape theory is <br>
right.<br>
