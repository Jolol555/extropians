What do you mean by "city"?  My impression is that in large urban U.S.<br>
inner cities, the police is not very accountable to the local<br>
citizens, who are in fact largely armed.  Here there does seem to be<br>
scope for substantial improvement by having a more local "subcity"<br>
police with laws and enforcement chosen by locals to be tuned to local<br>
circumstances.<br>
