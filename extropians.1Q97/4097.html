Amid the usual invective, Brad Aisa includes some real content:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are facts which give rise to the need for intellectual property </i><br>
<i>&gt;rights. The principle fact is that unique intellectual and material </i><br>
<i>&gt;products of human invention do not come from nowhere, and can only in </i><br>
<i>&gt;principle be maintained if the originators can then derive profit from </i><br>
<i>&gt;them, not by luck or maybe's, but by right. In the case of material </i><br>
<i>&gt;inventions, it is often an easy matter to copy what has been invented once </i><br>
<i>&gt;invented (this is the whole root of the means whereby evil in any manner </i><br>
<i>&gt;can flourish -- it is much easier to parasitize than to originate, provided </i><br>
<i>&gt;the hosts permit it). It can take a decade or more of research to develop a </i><br>
<i>&gt;new drug and the means of its synthesis. From there, any third rate hack </i><br>
<i>&gt;entrepreneur can copy the formula. Meanwhile, the originator has expended </i><br>
<i>&gt;the massive capital in development, and in the long-range needs of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;product's support. The parasite need only pay for what is immediately </i><br>
<i>&gt;required to produce the product. This is not fair.</i><br>
<p>
True, the high-investment invention is a fact of reality we have to deal<br>
with.  But to say that our current method of dealing with it--patents--<br>
is the /only/ method is not resoning, it's just paucity of imagination.<br>
<p>
Drugs in particular don't really have this problem, because in a free<br>
economy (i.e., not one crippled by the FDA like ours), one can sell a drug<br>
without revealing the process by which it was created, and processes cannot<br>
be easily deduced from results.  One thing a patent does is /require/<br>
disclosure of the process, whether the creator wants to or not.  Without<br>
patents, old-fashioned secrecy would take up much of the slack.<br>
<p>
But the long-toiling inventor meme /does/ apply to some cases--very few<br>
of the actual patents issued, I contend, but to some nonetheless, so that<br>
fact does need to be dealt with.<br>
<p>
Let us first observe that since the final act of invention is usually a<br>
single observation at the end of a process of work, the act of invention<br>
itself is sepearate from the act of investing in the research that led<br>
to it.  The inventor might have invested his own time, but more likely<br>
he was working under grant or employ, where quite properly the rewards<br>
of the invention go mostly to his patron.  It is not, then, the final<br>
fortuitous act of invention or discovery that created the value, but<br>
rather the act of /investment/, speculation, or foresight that led the<br>
inventor to spend time on otherwise unprofitable work.  The question<br>
then becomes how do we properly reward accurate foresight or courageous<br>
speculation in the act of research funding?<br>
<p>
Patents are certainly one way to do that: you invested the time and<br>
money to make the discovery, so we grant you a monopoly for a time to<br>
profit from it.  It would perhaps improve the system a bit if we granted<br>
the time of the patent in proportion to the demonstrable amount of time<br>
and money invested in the discovery rather than a fixed amount; that<br>
way such random happenstance as Goodyear's discovery of vulcanized<br>
rubber would become available sooner than the invention of someone who<br>
actually spent some time to reseach.<br>
<p>
Another possible system would be an invention futures market: let the<br>
people who need something invented (say, those who suffer from some<br>
disease and need a cure) invest money in a prize to be awarded to the<br>
first person who succeeds in discovering it.  They could even go to<br>
the others who might need it and have them sign a contract that they<br>
will buy it from the one who gets the prize, so those contracts become<br>
part of the prize: the first one who gets there gets the money and the<br>
contracts.  In fact, the actual money isn't necessary--since we have<br>
pre-sold the future invention for an agreed price, the value of those<br>
contracts can be used to judge how much investment should be put into<br>
each possible field.<br>
<p>
That way, speculators can view the futures market for the big prizes,<br>
or prizes for things they have expertise in, and decide how to invest<br>
their money in research.  The researchers themselves get paid for the<br>
work they do, the speculators get the big prize, and the accidental<br>
inventions made along the way still have the advantage of being first<br>
to market and possible secrecy, and no monopolies were needed.<br>
