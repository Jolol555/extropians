<i>&gt; Bacteria on Mars, if proven, would be a little unsettling, but there would  </i><br>
<i>&gt; still be a very long way go from there to intelligence and technology. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't  think wormholes or the speed of light is relevant, even in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; unlikely event that we can never go faster than we can right now, we could </i><br>
<i>&gt; still send Von Neumann probes to every star in the Galaxy in less than </i><br>
<i>&gt; 100 million years and transform it beyond recognition, and that's not much </i><br>
<i>&gt; time on a Cosmological time frame.</i><br>
<p>
Pfui.  A single galaxy?  Makes perfect sense that we're the First.  Just<br>
requires, what, a billion stars per techie species?  Only on a<br>
Universal, 10^22-star scale is it a bit worrisome.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why should a meaningless Universe make me depressed? It is my sincerest wish  </i><br>
<i>&gt; that I am correct and that the universe has no meaning, because then I would  </i><br>
<i>&gt; be free to give it any meaning I want, otherwise I'm stuck with a meaning I </i><br>
<i>&gt; may not like one bit.</i><br>
<p>
Stop with the atheist hyperbole.  Not everyone who disagrees with you is<br>
a slavering religious fanatic.  Having discussed that previously,<br>
onwards.<br>
<p>
Let me translate your proposal into formal ethical terms.  You do not<br>
wish any goal to have inherently positive value, because then you would<br>
be free to assign positive value to any goals you chose.<br>
<p>
Now.  If no goal has positive value, but you assign goals positive<br>
value, you would simply be wrong.  Try translating your proposal into<br>
practical terms.  You are saying:  "I hope that there's no way to walk<br>
across the room, because then I am free to assign to my actions whatever<br>
walk-across-the-room-utility values I choose."  Presumably you will<br>
choose to assign a high value, in terms of getting across the room, to<br>
blowing your nose.  Now, in point of fact, blowing your nose will not<br>
help you get across the room.<br>
<p>
Your proposal *is* more intuitively appealing then the reductio above. <br>
This is because of instinctive us-vs.-them thinking, as your<br>
John-vs.-God example demonstrated.  It seems preferable to choose your<br>
own goals than to have them imposed.  But that is not the issue - or<br>
rather, the issue goes beyond that.<br>
<p>
When we "choose our own goals" instead of having them "externally<br>
imposed", we are not choosing our *ultimate* goals.  We are choosing our<br>
own goals in terms of which goals seem most desirable in terms of our<br>
premanufactured, externally imposed ultimate goals, such as stimulation<br>
of the pleasure centers.  And we do not want goals "externally imposed"<br>
because they would conflict with our ultimate goal of stimulating our<br>
pleasure centers.<br>
<p>
If there isn't a real Meaning of Life, our ultimate goals will always be<br>
externally imposed.  Always.  John K Clark wants there to be no meaning<br>
to Life so he can assign high value to, say, exploring the galaxy.  And<br>
he will want to assign high value to exploring the galaxy because he<br>
thinks it will be fun.  And he thinks it will be fun, because evolution<br>
says it will be fun.  So evolution is choosing John K Clark's goals for<br>
him, in the absence of any real meaning to the Universe.<br>
<p>
That example doesn't justify the "Always".  In formal ethical terms, no<br>
Meaning means - by definition - that any existing positive-value goals<br>
were imposed by external fiat, or derived from positive-value goals<br>
imposed by external fiat, or Interim (having probabilistic value). <br>
Leave out the Interim; John K Clark is assuming that we know for *sure*<br>
that all goals have zero inherent value; thus no Interim goals.  Thus<br>
there is no conceivable reason for John K Clark wanting to assign<br>
meaning to anything, which will not trace its roots to evolution. <br>
Either John K Clark will not know this, or he will know this and will<br>
deliberately lie to himself.<br>
<p>
By contrast, suppose the Meaning of Life is "new ideas".  I can discard<br>
all externally imposed goals, deduce that the Meaning is "new ideas",<br>
and set out, completely free from all coercion, to explore the Galaxy in<br>
search of new ideas.<br>
<p>
You see, the thing about Life being meaningless is that you couldn't<br>
have any positive-value goals except through self-delusion motivated by<br>
externally imposed falsely meaningful goals.  You'll choose your own<br>
meaning?  By what criterion?  Life?  Joy?  Laughter?  But they won't be<br>
meaningful.  In actual fact, they won't be meaningful.  So you'll be<br>
lying to yourself.<br>
<p>
I think what you really hope is that the Meaning of Life will *be* what<br>
you want it to be, like "joy in newness" and not something you<br>
*wouldn't* want it to be, like "worshipping God".  As you point out,<br>
worshipping God is of no conceivable value to the Universe, once viewed<br>
from the proper perspective.  What good is worship to God?  What good is<br>
worship to anything?  So a bunch of people have, in their belief<br>
systems, the idea that God is of positive value.  So what?  Who cares? <br>
What does it matter?  That can't be the Meaning of Life.<br>
<p>
Try to get this straight.  If you can assign an absolute<br>
(non-probabilistic) positive value to anything, without deluding<br>
yourself or being motivated by externally imposed goals, that is the<br>
Meaning of Life.  Maybe there's one, maybe there's a dozen, maybe they<br>
conflict with each other and maybe they don't.  Maybe they're<br>
observer-relative, maybe you can engineer them to be whatever you want<br>
them to be.  Maybe you'll fall on your knees and maybe you'll explore<br>
the Universe.<br>
<p>
But.  You'll decide to do it.  Of your own free will.  Maybe the logic<br>
is inexorable, and maybe it will conflict with previously established<br>
goals, and maybe it leads to something you wouldn't want to face as you<br>
are.  But it will still be you, and nothing imposed by God, man or<br>
evolution, that makes the decision that this is, that this must be,<br>
Right.<br>
