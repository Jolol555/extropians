John, could you format replies with a lot less indent and use shorter<br>
lines?  My editor chokes on your postings.  Thanks.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the animals were much larger than that, then we can make 2 conclusions  </i><br>
<i>&gt; about these hunters who were armed with nothing but rocks and tiny brains: </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) They had a huge amount of courage. </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) They did not leave a huge number of descendants</i><br>
<p>
The whole point of projectile hunting it to be able to damage your prey<br>
at a standoff distance where they can't hurt you.<br>
                     <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I very much doubt a hunting group got that many opportunities                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to hit something in a day, certainly not as many throws as a                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;baseball pitcher will make.                        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even with great natural ability baseball pitchers need to practice to be good </i><br>
<i>&gt; at their job, they practice constantly until their arm wares out. If these </i><br>
<i>&gt; hunters saved their arm and did not practice, how could they hope to hit  </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything?             </i><br>
<p>
I know someone who could throw a very fast rock and hit small targets.<br>
He did this on minimum practice.  He was also very good with a sling.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;So much context has been lost that I am not sure how this                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ran, but I think my point was that bipetalism was a                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;prerequisite for throwing. My point was how the big expansion                </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;grew out of the earlier adaptions to projectile hunting which  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a chimp sized brain could support.                         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Once bipedalism and a hand almost as good as ours was developed, the point </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lucy was at, I don't find it all that mysterious that the brain grew very </i><br>
<i>&gt; rapidly.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think it did, i.e., brains stayed much the same for a million<br>
years or more after Lucy (I think).  There are some *real* problems in<br>
growing larger brains, ask any woman who has had a baby.  (Calvin goes <br>
into these problems at length.)<br>
 <br>
           Yes, it will help you with throwing, but with that good hand  <br>
<i>&gt; intelligence will help you do a lot of other things too. What I don't  </i><br>
<i>&gt; understand is why bipedalism developed and why Lucy evolved a first rate hand </i><br>
<i>&gt; when she still had a third rate brain.</i><br>
                       <br>
I don't have a pointer, but I remember that one chimp was taught to <br>
chip rock--or at least fracture them to get a sharp edge.  I suspect that<br>
our hands are not that advanced over a chimp's.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;even a prey species that would be very likely to lose in a                 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fight to the death with a predator, may be able to deter                 </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that predator by virtue of the small chance of a different                </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;outcome. After all, the predators aren't out for fights to     </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the death as such, all they want is lunch.                       </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with that, I just have my doubts that a pre-human throwing a rock  </i><br>
<i>&gt; would even be a good bluff, and as a offensive hunting weapon I think it </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be hopeless. </i><br>
<p>
It might be more useful for that in the early stages, but after a while of<br>
using rocks/sticks to fend off preditors, some genious of Lucy's clan <br>
would use it to obtain lunch.  After that . . . . <br>
<p>
In fact, it has just occured to me that an animal who ventured out on the<br>
flats, even to scavenge, would no longer have the option of going up a tree<br>
to avoid preditors.  If they already had a tendency to throw things (which<br>
chimps do and Lucy most likely did) then they might very well take to<br>
carrying sticks and rocks for preditor defense.  The need to carry defensive<br>
objects might well have been one of the things which led to bipedalism, i.e.,<br>
those who knuckle walked and did *not* carry a big stick, got et.  If you're<br>
hungry for meat, and chimps certainly seem to be, venturing out on the plains<br>
is a real temptation --because plains grow a lot of meat per square mile by<br>
comparison to a forest. <br>
<p>
Incidentally, isolation on the dryer side of the east african rift seems <br>
to have been one major factor in the evolution of the human line.<br>
