[I said:]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Can Extropianism win?  From my perspective, no, frankly, because like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the Marxists, you offer nothing to replace the energies you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; removed.  In Marxism, they took away the profit-motive and didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; replace it, so nothing got done.  If you remove all moralizing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; self-righteousness and coercion and victimization and resentment and so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on, nothing is left to propel the meme forward.  Extropianism isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quite so morality-free, which is why it survives, but it still has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nothing to replace the power-engines it has forsaken.</i><br>
[Anders Sandburg replied:]<br>
<i>&gt; That was a good point. But extropianism (and transhumanism) can probably </i><br>
<i>&gt; create new power-engines and ways of focussing human emotions: digital </i><br>
<i>&gt; communities, divergent versions of humanity, blaming everything on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; entropians :-) Other examples?</i><br>
<p>
Blaming everything on the entropians is a mutation I've already<br>
witnessed, and really amounts simply to the invention of the phrase<br>
"entropian".<br>
<p>
Why do I care about digital communities?<br>
Why would I die for a divergent version of humanity?<br>
What emotional powers are backing these phrases?<br>
<p>
Sometimes self-interest isn't enough to propagate a meme!  Immortality<br>
and digital communities are very much in my interest, but they don't<br>
take advantage of the built-in *political* emotions, the ones which lead<br>
us to instinctively share our views with others.  You have to either (1)<br>
attack the current political system, (2) defend it, or (3) use a memetic<br>
sleight-of-hand to utilize the emotions powering (1) and (2) above.<br>
<p>
The problem with Extropian memes is that they involve goals which will<br>
benefit *everyone*, *equally*.  You just can't do that and propagate<br>
your meme.  There has to be someone to take the fall or it isn't<br>
politics.  Frankly, I think the Christians hit on the best solution with<br>
Satan:  Pin all the blame on a fantasy entity.  The only problem is that<br>
we'd have to lie.  Maybe we could demonize death? <br>
