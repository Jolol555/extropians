I live in Santa Cruz, and I go into the Valley about once a month to<br>
attend the<br>
Bay Area Cryonics meetings (and host them now and then), which are set<br>
at 4PM<br>
on the 2nd Sunday of each month. I would gladly attend an Extropians<br>
meeting monthly<br>
if it were possible to co-ordinate with the Cryo meetings. Perhaps meet<br>
at 11AM<br>
through lunch to say 3PM on the 2nd Sunday of each month. Would you host<br>
the first<br>
meeting?? I am also a fan of lending books around, most of the Extropian<br>
titles<br>
cannot be found at my local library. Perhaps attendees could bring a few<br>
titles<br>
for loaning around of interest...<br>
<p>
BTW, there's a reading list attached to the Exi home page...<br>
