Nonetheless, these examples appear anecdotal when set next to the multitude<br>
of cultural examples that support the position of _The Adapted Mind_.  Based<br>
on evidence available, I would be more inclined to question why this pattern<br>
emerges rather than whether or not the pattern exists.<br>
<p>
Also, I would be hesitant to include the pioneer societies of Early America<br>
as an example of equal cognitive role abilities.  This particular example is<br>
too short-term to be of significance in a phenomenon that has thousands and<br>
possibly millions of years of history.  I would say that it simply<br>
demonstrates the general adaptability of the human mind.  History is<br>
peppered with instances where traditional roles have been reversed for short<br>
periods of time.  Usually these instances are driven by and associated with<br>
times of hardship and desperation.<br>
