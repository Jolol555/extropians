Thanks Dan....<br>
<p>
I really wonder if we will ever be able to determine the ability to learn a<br>
particular area from genetic coding *anyway*.  How does one determine that<br>
a genome is related to an aptitude for a specific learning area?  I could<br>
see that a genome might be related to a talent....my mother was an opera<br>
singer and I inherited her voice (we almost are identical in terms of our<br>
voices, including vocal range and flexibility of the vocal cords), but I'm<br>
also certain that in hearing her sing around the house I mimicked her as a<br>
small child and intuitively understood how to maximize my potential in my<br>
voice because I heard how she used her voice.<br>
<p>
One could say that women are more genetically inclined towards learning<br>
languages?  There are a lot of multi-lingualed women in language programs,<br>
and many top level, (for instance the UN) translators, are women.  Or<br>
perhaps people with a musical ear are more inclined to hearing the tonality<br>
differences and can learn other language pronunciations   <br>
