<i>&gt; Yes, so if a system is consistent, that is, if you can't prove that the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing is both true and false with it, then it is not complete, and that means</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there are TRUE statements that do NOT have a proof in that system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's why I don't understand when you say " Godel does not really have any</i><br>
<i>&gt; implications about the limits of human knowledge".</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps that is too strong a statement.  How about "Godel has no<br>
implications about the limits of our knowledge of reality."?  I<br>
reject your postulation that "The Goldbach Conjecture is either<br>
true or false", except within the definitions of "true" and "false"<br>
postulated by the system in which it is expressed.  There is no<br>
fundamental connection between the mathematical, human-made concept<br>
of "true theorem" (i.e., theorem logically consistent with axioms)<br>
and the metaphysical "truth" as in "consistent with reality".  Any<br>
such mapping we make between the two is an inductively-reasoned<br>
convenience for making predictions about reality.<br>
<p>
The final arbiter of reality is observation.  When a mathematical<br>
model (like, say, Newtonian mechanics) maps well enough to our<br>
observations to make useful predictions, then we should use it.  And<br>
when it fails, we should modify it.  Whatever "truths" we may find<br>
by exploring mathematics itself, apart from reality, can have no<br>
bearing upon our lives or experiences until we choose to make such<br>
a mapping, and when we do, it is observation, not logical proof, that<br>
will be our judge.  Any "truth" that cannot be tested by perception<br>
is of no possible value to any real being.  Therefore, Godel's<br>
result is simply a fact about the way we manipulate symbols.  It has<br>
no bearing whatsoever upon reality or our ability to perceive it.<br>
