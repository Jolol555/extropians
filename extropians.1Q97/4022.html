<i>&gt;Interesting information Robin. Marx, however, does seemed to have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;racist. He made numerous racist remarks about Jews when attacking other</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialists he felt rivalrous with including La Salle.</i><br>
<p>
Let me clarify.  I quote from Gould, "Mismeasure of Man" (p.422)<br>
<p>
  "The egqalitarian end did not exist for the policymakers of Darwin's<br>
   day. All were racists by modern standards.  On that spectrum, those we<br>
   now judge most harshly urged that inferiority be used as an excuse for<br>
   dispossession and slavery, while those we most admire in restrospect<br>
   urged a moral principle of equal rights and nonexploitation, whatever<br>
   the biological status of people."<br>
<p>
Carlyle and his socialist allies I am referring to were "Brutal"<br>
racists, advocating slavery and cruel treatment of blacks, using<br>
language that is quite shocking to the modern ear.  My understanding<br>
is that Marx was much more moderate than this. <br>
