Theoretically yes, but I don't think the evolution of intelligence is easy <br>
and I don't thing it's inevitable. Life started almost 4 billion years ago, <br>
but for 99.95% of that time there was nothing much smarter than a chimp.<br>

<p>
Make that 3.9 million years ago, that's when our fist bipedal ancestor, <br>
Australopithecus Afarensis (Lucy) came along. Although it's somewhat after  <br>
this period, there is evidence that both the gracile and the robust <br>
australopithecine were harassed by predators, and both had a brain 50% larger <br>
than Lucy had. Bite marks made by Leopards have been found in many of the <br>
skulls of these animals, and there is even evidence that they carried the<br>
carcass into trees to eat them. I'm mot saying that the same species of <br>
Leopard was around in Lucy's day but I'll tell you one thing, I've never heard <br>
of an ecosystem, past or present, that had prey species but no predators, <br>
and besides Lucy there were many other types of tasty meat running around, <br>
several varieties of pigs and a sort of dwarf hippopotamus among others. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;all the big predators in the late miocene were Aquatic.</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
I very much doubt that "all" were, but we do know that Lucy lived near a lake <br>
that was full of crocodiles.<br>
                        <br>

<i>                &gt;Acinonyx [...] like smilodon, they were nowhere near as                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;intelligent or as sophisticated hunters as modern big cats                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;[...]  Smilodon and early acinonyx, were stupid cats! [...]                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;more dangrous to Afarensis would have been hyenids, of course                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;also underdeveloped, and not to be compared with todays hyena  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;species [...] You were putting up chimps against modern                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;predators, not prehistoric homonids against prehistoric                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;predators !</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
You're assuming that because we are enormously smarter than Lucy was then <br>
present day predators must be enormously smarter than the predators of Lucy's <br>
day. It's not so. <br>
<p>
Yes, if you plotted the average brain size of all animals from the extinction <br>
of the Dinosaurs to now you would find a modest increase, but there is nothing <br>
modest that happened to the human line. The brains of our ancestors got almost <br>
5 times as big in just 3 million years, and nothing even close to that has <br>
ever happened in Evolution before. This huge explosion in brain size started <br>
at the same moment we developed bipedalism and a hand that can make complex <br>
motions. I don't believe this is a coincidence, and that's why I think the <br>
bipedalism question is so important.<br>
