<p>
 But where are the benefits to the candidate? I doubt there are a<br>
lot of elections where the expected salary exceeds the cost of getting<br>
a majority of voters to remember the candidates name (except for<br>
small town governments where the politicians aren't a separate enough<br>
class for their interests to diverge from the voters enough for the<br>
random democracy to matter).<br>
<p>
 However, you are clearly right that there isn't any passionate<br>
demand for random democracy, which is somewhat contrary to what<br>
you suggest in the "Confidence: A Basic Politics Puzzle" thread.<br>
Indeed, it is hard enough to imagine an average person holding<br>
a strong opinion on random democracy, and I suspect the absence<br>
of selfish motives for supporting random democracy has something<br>
to do with this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Given the frequency with which candidates break promises ("Read my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;lips ...", "I won't seek a second term", etc.), why would voters</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;expect they could enforce a promise of randomness?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How about posting a bond that you lose if you break your promise?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Compared to most political promises, this should be relatively easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt;verify that it was broken.</i><br>
<p>
 Good question. Why isn't this used for the kinds of promises politicians<br>
are making now? There appears to be plenty of demand for the benefits<br>
it would provide, and I can't see any obstacles that deter its use.<br>
