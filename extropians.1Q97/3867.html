You have my utmost sympathy for the problems you have encountered in <br>
attempting to discuss your own closely-held ideas with your friends, <br>
and I suspect that all transhumanists have encountered a similar <br>
situation in their own lives.<br>
<p>
My master's degree went into a crash-and-burn a few months ago when <br>
one of my degree committee members decided that a transhumanist <br>
emphasis was not something that he could support.  And my time at <br>
Antioch, supposedly a bastion of progressive thinking, was <br>
characterized by hostility from my classmates towards transhumanist <br>
ideas.  For even mentioning that someday we might move beyond race, I <br>
was called a racist.  For stating that I don't worship anything, I <br>
was reviled as heartless and cold.  For wishing that people could <br>
learn to relate beyond gender roles, I was considered anti-woman.  <br>
<p>
My friends repeatedly urged to me to get out of this bad situation and <br>
get back to writing, and I finally took that advise.  Most of them don't <br>
relate to the concept of transhumanism, but they at least support me in <br>
trying to pursue it, and they will listen to me when I talk about it. <br>
Realistically, only another transhumanist is going to be able to <br>
relate on that level, and I hope that the Internet lists and the <br>
efforts of the Extropy institute will aid in everyone finding ways to <br>
connect with each other.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
