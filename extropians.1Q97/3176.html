<i>&gt; Exactly. No government agent can be held accountable for his or her</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions if its his or her secret clone doing the dirty deeds while they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are ensconced in their office with plenty of witnesses to provide the</i><br>
<i>&gt; alibi.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure that would work.  Fingerprints would still be different. <br>
Also, the make-up required to make a clone look 30+ years older could be<br>
detectable.  Besides, why would someone need a clone to do their dirty work<br>
when they could simply have a lackey do it?  If you want to go into<br>
behavorial genetics (something which I am skeptical about, but is an<br>
interesting point here) might the clone want to keep his hands clean as<br>
well?  I don't think anyone is going to be able to do anything with a clone<br>
that they would not be able to do with fanatical followers and look alikes.<br>
