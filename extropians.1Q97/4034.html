<i>&gt; PF:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Functioning markets existed for foreign authors in the U.S. in the 19th</i><br>
<i>&gt; century. The free market paid royalties to British authors even though</i><br>
<i>&gt; those authors received no copyright protection in the US until the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extension of copyright protection to foreigners in 1891. The American</i><br>
<i>&gt; publishers paid the royalty in order to obtain advance galleys, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; though they themselves had no legal protection against competitors who</i><br>
<i>&gt; could legally copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; state protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and</i><br>
<i>&gt; contractual arrangements for the internalization of externalities."</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; DF:</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is an important difference between the situation then and now. With</i><br>
<i>&gt; 19th c. printing technology, there were large fixed costs and sizable time</i><br>
<i>&gt; lags. The authorized publisher, who got the manuscript in the U.S. before</i><br>
<i>&gt; it was published in Britain, could pay his fixed costs out of the early</i><br>
<i>&gt; sales. A pirate would have to duplicate those fixed costs. The authorized</i><br>
<i>&gt; publisher could then issue a "fighting edition"--a low cost second edition</i><br>
<i>&gt; priced low enough so that the pirate would never make back his costs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With current printing technology, absent copyright, the pirate's costs are</i><br>
<i>&gt; much lower than the original publisher's, since he can use photo offset or</i><br>
<i>&gt; something similar to free ride on the original publisher's layout,</i><br>
<i>&gt; proofing, etc. So that method doesn't work.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, costs are different now.  But so, too, is the value of timeliness, and<br>
for the same reasons.  When it took months to distribute a book, that book<br>
was still "new" to its consumers a year after publication.  In the age<br>
of the photocopier and television, new books, magazines, movies, and other<br>
works lose their novelty that much quicker, and thereby increase the value<br>
of being first to market.  In the age of the Internet, live stock quotes<br>
are very expensive, but 20-minute old stock quotes are free.  Tickets to<br>
live performances or ballgames continue to sell in spite of the fact that<br>
television coverage is so good, because immediacy has value. <br>
<p>
As the artworks themselves grow more complex, access to "source code"<br>
in the loose sense becomes more valuable as well.  This applies not just<br>
to software where the originator can always out-support and out-fix his<br>
competitors without source access, but even to things like movies, where<br>
access to the original uncomposited negatives, unreleased scenes, and<br>
unpublished story line allowed the makers of Star Wars to make millions<br>
with a an improved re-release of a 20-year-old movie.  It is hard to make<br>
that case for books--but even there I can imagine being able to retain<br>
certain information that makes updates easier or makes interviews with<br>
the real author more interesting (and therefore more valuable), or for<br>
having more interactive content somehow (900-number reader polls, etc.)<br>
<p>
So yes, technology changes the numbers, but it does so on both the<br>
pro-copyright side and the anti-copyright side.  Does it then make sense<br>
to use law to lock ourselves into a system based on the assumptions of<br>
older technology?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As this example suggests, whether alternatives to IP protection work, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; how well, depends on details of the associated technology. Certainly there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are alternatives. But I don't think one can say, a priori, whether relying</i><br>
<i>&gt; on them will produce plenty of intellectual property, an inefficiently but</i><br>
<i>&gt; not catastrophically low level, or practically none--it depends.</i><br>
<p>
That argument can apply to any government interference in the market.<br>
What one considers an "adequate level" of invention and writing is just<br>
as debateable as what one considers an adequate level of food or<br>
housing.  Libertarians generally concede that free-market solutions<br>
work for all other goods.  Why not for inventions?<br>
<p>
Of course, inventions are different--that is the basis of my own<br>
argument in the first place, so I cannot simultaneously say that the<br>
property/idea analogy fails in one argument, then use the same analogy<br>
in this one.  But I think it is still fair to assume on principle<br>
that interference is unnecessary until proven otherwise, and the proof<br>
is just not there.  I understand from your contributions to HPO that<br>
you are less swayed by moral arguments than pragmatic ones, but when<br>
there are moral arguments on both sides, pragmatic arguments on both<br>
sides, and little solid evidence for either, the principle on which<br>
I assume the absence of IP law is not one of libertarian morality,<br>
but just Occam's Razor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the subject of first mover advantages, my favorite quote is from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kipling's "Mary Gloster," possibly his best poem:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "They asked me how I did it and I gave 'em the scripture text</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'You keep your light so shining a little ahead of the next,'</i><br>
<i>&gt; They copied all they could copy, but they couldn't copy my mind,</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I left them, sweating and stealing, a year and a half behind."</i><br>
<p>
Thanks.  I have an epigraph for chapter 4 now. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the economics of IP protection, people might be interested in my Dayton</i><br>
<i>&gt; Law Review article on Standards, on my web page, and in the discussion of</i><br>
<i>&gt; IP in the lecture notes for my L&amp;E course (current and last quarter's</i><br>
<i>&gt; course visiting at Stanford), also on my web page.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, they were interesting.  Both, though, seemed more to describe how<br>
IP works, and what its effects are likely to be, but neither seemed to<br>
spend any serious effort questioning the idea in the first place.  Which<br>
is fine--I understand that you're somewhat agnostic on the issue. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "But as Friedman and others have</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown with more detailed economic analysis, the net gains are</i><br>
<i>&gt; always less than the net losses, because a subsidy changes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; relative value of the commodity subsidized, leading to inefficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; trades in every business affected by that commodity."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's tricky in the copyright case. You get an inefficiently low level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; production and consumption of those books that are written, since the price</i><br>
<i>&gt; includes royalty although the marginal cost to the author of having one</i><br>
<i>&gt; more copy sold is zero. But you move the number of books written closer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the efficient level, because you raise the reward to the people who bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fixed cost of producing books (author and publisher) closer to its real</i><br>
<i>&gt; value to the users. So you are losing on one margin and gaining on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  But there are thousands of other tansactions influenced beyond<br>
those of just book producers and book consumers.  Every cost-shifting<br>
we make effects other choices those individuals might make in their<br>
lives from choosing education to choosing a career to choosing a burial<br>
plot (or cryo-tank, in my case).  I think legal restraint in the absence<br>
of good evidence is called for in this case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it is worth distinguishing two features of IP law--the fact that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; protects certain things that may or may not seem like property, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that enforcement is in part paid for by the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose we ignore, for a moment, the question of enforcement cost, and just</i><br>
<i>&gt; ask whether the enforcement itself is a bad thing. One obvious answer is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that IP is a substitute for contractual arrangements that most of us would</i><br>
<i>&gt; approve of if it were practical to enforce them. An author could, after</i><br>
<i>&gt; all, sell his book with an explicit shrink wrap license, binding the buyer</i><br>
<i>&gt; not to reproduce the book, not to permit others to reproduce the book, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; making the buyer liable for damages to the author if his copy does get</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduced, with or without his permission. If that contract could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforced, it would be very much like copyright law. The practical problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that when pirate copies get out there is usually no way of proving whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; copy got pirated (a problem that may be soluble for some digital works,</i><br>
<i>&gt; incidentally), and the guilty party, if located, may be judgement proof. So</i><br>
<i>&gt; if one approves of the results that would be produced by such a contractual</i><br>
<i>&gt; regime, if enforceable, it is hard to see why, from a consequentialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; standpoint, one should reject the same results when produced by IP law.</i><br>
<p>
That's a good way to recast the argument: let's assume that the (C) is<br>
just a shortcut for the whole shrink-wrap license version of IP (for the<br>
moment ignoring broadcasts and billboards).  The question then becomes,<br>
Is it in the best interest of authors in general to put the mark on their<br>
books?  This is a much harder question, and if the answer is "yes", then<br>
much of my argument against IP weakens, because I will then have to draw<br>
in enforcement costs and moral arguments and such.  I still believe that<br>
the answer is "no", but it forces me to clarify the benefit more.  A work<br>
to which the (C) is attached will probably increase the /relative, short-<br>
term/ wealth of the author.  That is, he will likely be wealthier as<br>
compared to his neighbor in the year of his book's publication than he<br>
might have been without the (C).  But the /absolute, long-term/ wealth<br>
of the author I believe would still benefit more from leaving the (C) off.<br>
This is because the ability of everyone else in the economy to exploit<br>
the work without restraint in ways he might not even have thought of, or<br>
ways he might not understand or approve of and so would fail to license,<br>
would improve the whole economy the  well beyond what relative gain he might<br>
have enjoyed from protection, by lowering the price and raising the<br>
quality of everything he buys, and speeding the discovery of new things.<br>
<p>
This is a psychological dilemma: we /feel/ more wealthy if it is<br>
relative to others at the same time, but absolute wealth is what we<br>
actually have to spend.  I suspect this is the motivation of many<br>
attempts to close market entry, like licensing and regulation.<br>
