From: "Lee Daniel Crocker" &lt;lcrocker@calweb.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Let us instead engineer ourselves more robustly to accept inputs</i><br>
<i>&gt; without malfunctioning, so that we can make use of a wider diversity</i><br>
<i>&gt; of inputs--experiences and communications--to work from.  And let</i><br>
<i>&gt; us design the /protocol/ clear, expandable, and powerful enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accommodate our needs.  Let's work on the language, and on our</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding and reasoning, and on our ability to express ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the language, rather than piling on burdens beyond the language</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we must accumulate like a stack of manual errata and release</i><br>
<i>&gt; notes (sorry if I'm getting too deep into the metaphor).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In short, let us stive to make ourselves more adaptable, tolerant,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and less fragile to experiences and ideas instead of putting limits</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the ideas we can express. </i><br>

This analogy to computer protocols is interesting, but it reminds me of<br>
the maxim commonly employed by engineers who must interface to these<br>
protocols: be permissive in what you accept and careful in what you send.<br>
For example, from the S/MIME interoperability profiles guide,<br>
<p>
"Throughout this paper, there are separate requirements and<br>
recommendations made for the handling of incoming messages versus the<br>
creation of outgoing messages.  In general, the often quoted,<br>
proverbial strategy is to 'be liberal in what you receive and<br>
conservative in what you send'.  Most of the requirements are placed<br>
on the handling of incoming messages while the recommendations are<br>
mostly on the creation of outgoing messages.  To rewrite the proverb<br>
somewhat, 'you are required to be liberal in what you receive and it<br>
is recommended that you be conservative in what you send.'"<br>
<p>
This is standard engineering practice in designing for maximum inter-<br>
operability.  (And even with this, interoperability is a chancy thing<br>
and is seldom achieved without actual interoperation testing.)<br>
<p>
Applying this advice to personal relations, it would be consistent with<br>
the first part of your advice about making your acceptance of input<br>
more robust.  But rather than seeing this as "instead of" being careful<br>
about what you say, it suggests that the two strategies are complementary.<br>
