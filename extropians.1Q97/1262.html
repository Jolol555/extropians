From: Damien Broderick &lt;damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; A simple example (too smug, too hasty, I got it wrong): if ABC changes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ABD, what will MRRJJJ become?  What does XYZ turn into?  A smart program</i><br>
<i>&gt; named Copycat has provided a range of solutions.  Answers: since ABC maps to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 123, ABD equals 124; hence JJJ becomes JJJJ, yielding MRRJJJJ (not, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; MRRJJD or MRRKKK, let alone MRRKKKK).  And XYZ: XYZZ?  XYY?  XYA?  Maybe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But clever Copycat saw that A maps onto Z.  Running backwards, we get WYZ.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Elegant.  Is that artificial mind creative, or what?</i><br>
<p>
Douglas Hofstadter's group is doing this work, and his book from last year<br>
goes into it in detail.<br>
<p>
I am skeptical about how well his results will generalize, although it is<br>
an interesting class of problems.  I can guarantee you that Hofstadter,<br>
a very smart man, saw the answers to the problems above immediately.<br>
In fact he and his students created the problems knowing they had these<br>
clever answers.  So then the task they faced was how to write a program<br>
which would get the same answers that they got.  That they were able to<br>
do so is very impressive.  But the question remains whether the data<br>
structures they came up with are of general enough applicability that<br>
they can shed light on other problems of AI.<br>
