<i>&gt;As I was considering the way that the United States is trying to restrict </i><br>
<i>&gt;export of cryptographic algorithms, I was thinking about the guy who </i><br>
<i>&gt;distributed PGP anyway, in spite of the laws against doing so.</i><br>
<p>
His name is Phil Zimmerman and he didn't know it was against the law when<br>
he first did it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He got in some </i><br>
<i>&gt;trouble for doing so, but what if he had distributed it over the Internet, </i><br>
<i>&gt;through anonymous remailers, so no one would know who sent it?  All he</i><br>
really <br>
<i>&gt;has to do is get it to someone outside of the United States and let *them* </i><br>
<i>&gt;distribute the software far and wide.</i><br>
<p>
You don't think PGP has made it across borders? I see it xferred all over<br>
the net and if you can't do that, you can always xfer it over warez<br>
newsgroups and IRC channels.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As far as I see it, the United States' </i><br>
<i>&gt;ban on the exportation of encryption algorithms is a hollow sentiment.</i><br>
<p>
This is exactly why I say the internet is breaking laws across the globe<br>
with shear force.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is it really as easy as I think it is to walk right through the United</i><br>
States' <br>
<i>&gt;encryption ban?  Or am I missing something?</i><br>
<p>
As far as I know it is. I mean, what could they possibly do to stop you. I<br>
think it's due to the blatant ignorance of the american gov't. Take this<br>
quote from Robert Dole, "The Internet is a great tool for getting on the<br>
net." Unless there is perhaps some advantage to having the US comply I<br>
don't see why they don't do this. Encryption along with pornography, warez,<br>
and other 'grey' and 'subversive' material cannot be stopped by any form of<br>
gov't except a global one. And as the net grows and technology increases,<br>
new forms of piracy are coming about. Take for instance the MPEG 1 layer 3<br>
compression standard that is now being utilized to transfer *entire* music<br>
CDs in full 44.1khz STEREO 16bit quality over the net. Next will be<br>
full-length feature films. It seems that the only way you can make a living<br>
on the net is by constantly investing, advertizing, or subscribed<br>
information. On the topic of 'warez', I see an end to computer software<br>
piracy because applications will likely soon fall under the 'constantly<br>
investing' category where you will pay for your copy of Microsoft Office by<br>
subscription because it will be constantly upgraded automatically.<br>
Encyclopedias will probably go away unless they can figure out content too<br>
large to be transferred online like large detailed VRML structures of<br>
monuments or such. Large established applications shouldn't have a problem<br>
and neither will multiplayer games due to registered owner serial numbers<br>
to verify the owner of the product such as the Kali multiplayer game<br>
software uses. Forgive me if I've drifted off the topic a bit but I'd like<br>
to add that I've indexed so-called 'subversive' and 'grey' information on<br>
my NeoReality website. I have yet to add an encryption section but thanks<br>
for reminding me. My site is contained on Geocities and has links material<br>
all over the net.<br>
