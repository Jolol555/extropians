<i>&gt; &gt;I found a ref ona NASA page stating that one Megaton was 4.2 x 10^22</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ergs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is equivalent to the ASTM standard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Yes it is quite small, and could easily be formed into the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stealthed shapes that Mark is puportin for nukes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Stealth would play less a role for big rocks.  Since a big rock is just "a</i><br>
<i>&gt; big rock" with no terminal guidance, and only kinetic energy as its energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; source, there is little you can do to defend against it.  It is falling</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether you like it or not.  The best you could do would be to modify the</i><br>
<i>&gt; trajectory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
True, but anything you put in an induction gun would probably be formed<br>
ahead of time in a lunar refinery. While a simple cylinder would be<br>
easiest to deal with, a penetrating shape would also be easily<br>
attainable, and putting guidance and maneuvering units onboard would<br>
also be possible, though would probably be the most expensive part<br>
(though nowhere near Marks estimates, as his are based on one off custom<br>
devices for a FEW satellites, not high production rates)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Note that this is not an exact science, and that there are many factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; involved.  I was simply demonstrating that nuclear weapons lose most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; their effectiveness in subterranean lunar environments.  Nuclear weapons are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; hundreds of times more effective on earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Thanks for a more expert opinion James. Based on a reference I found of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;4.2 x 10^22 ergs per Megaton, I calculated 15 tons of TNT equiv. for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1 ton rock, so while I was seriously wrong in my own estimate, Mark was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;under by almost three times. I don't know why that number stuck in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;brain, I had read it somewhere...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Additionally, in terms of damage ability, large nukes have, even in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;atmosphere, an attentuating effectivness proportionate with their yeild.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A 10 MT device will only have a damage area of between 4-8 times larger</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than a 300 KT device, which is why the powers have gotten away from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;using big nukes, as they are not as cost effective as using the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;amount of material in four or more devices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The scaling factor for nuclear weapons is (Yield1/Yield2)^(1/3), where</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yield1 and Yield2 are the yields of the nuclear devices in question.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; scaling factor is "ideal" for all explosives, nuclear or conventional.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideal case more or less holds up until about the 10Mt range, where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; exponent starts to decrease slightly due to "real" factors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you think about it, a cube root scaling factor makes perfect sense for</i><br>
<i>&gt; scaling one dimensional energy values in 3D space.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I was hoping you'd have an idea on this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;For examply, a high altitude attack by 3-4 B-52s carrying conventional</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2000 lb HE bombs can damage as much area as a 10-20 KT nuke, though</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;without the radiation effects. In fact, because the concussive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shockwaves are from dozens of sources, rather than one device, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;actually are more effective in their area of effectiveness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The obvious reason for this being that a single large explosion is poorer at</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributing destructive energy than many smaller explosions that have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; spread out.  You maximize the area of optimal destructive energy.  Cluster</i><br>
<i>&gt; bombs are designed with the same principle in mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Oklahoma bombing was not equivalent to a ton of TNT.  Although the truck</i><br>
<i>&gt; carried an estimated 1-1.5 tons of explosive, my "expert" estimate would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a damage equivalence of about 1/4 ton of TNT based on the structural damage.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks James. Given this, what is your guesstimate of what an 11 km/s<br>
one ton ferrous rock could do, with a 15 ton impact force? <br>
<p>
Size of crater?<br>
If preshaped for penetration, effective depth?<br>
effective radii of shock wave?<br>
anything else?<br>
