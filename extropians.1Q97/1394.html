[Lyle Burkhead:]<br>
<i>&gt; What I said about Abel was graphic, but it was absolutely true, and there </i><br>
<i>&gt; was nothing abusive about it.  A genius can't be stopped by anything </i><br>
<i>&gt; short of death.  A genius will do anything, literally anything, to pursue </i><br>
<i>&gt; his vision, even if he has to starve and spit blood.  That's the level </i><br>
<i>&gt; on which the game is played.  When believers in the equality meme </i><br>
<i>&gt; tell me that women would be geniuses if only their school counsellors </i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't discourage them, it's bullshit.  </i><br>
<p>
Nonsense.  Some geniuses stop on a dime and are easily distracted,<br>
particularly the ones operating on a permanently low level of mental<br>
energy.  Being a genius doesn't require tremendous willpower, just high<br>
intelligence/smartness.  Many famous geniuses were highly persistent<br>
("perseverant") individuals, and some were laid-back and relaxed.  The<br>
high-powered ones may have gotten more done, but again willpower has<br>
little to do with innate intelligence, Thomas Edison to the contrary.  I<br>
could equally say that being a genius requires a will to publicity, a<br>
willingness to expose oneself to the media, or a publishable personal<br>
quirk (Hawking's illness) since many famous geniuses possessed these<br>
qualities...<br>
