<i>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The EEC and the potential EU seem to be a quite fascinating area to apply</i><br>
<i>&gt; memetic thinking to; judging from the current tendencies the</i><br>
supernational<br>
<i>&gt; levels are developing a very different reality-tunnel from the national</i><br>
<i>&gt; levels, which in turn are developing their own, and so on. </i><br>
<p>
The EU is an example of a good idea gone sour. It's being so badly<br>
implemented, that on can only laugh of the stupid regulations that are<br>
coming out of there.<br>
It's probably stemming from the fact that too many socialists are involved<br>
in the process. There's far to much regulation going on, being pressed from<br>
the top down.<br>
Here in Denmark we recently voted no to be a part of the new EU (with a<br>
margin of something like 2%), but the politicians changed a comma or two<br>
and went for another vote. This time the country bend over and obeyed<br>
because of scare tactics from the government.<br>
Nobody i know ho voted for EU did it because they thought it was a good<br>
idea, but because the felt they had to as responible persons. Hardly anyone<br>
actually likes EU. Hey this is Europe, we've been fighting allways. Why<br>
should we suddenly love each other?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking forward to an Europe with several incompatible reality models</i><br>
<i>&gt; actively interfering in each other, each strongly supported by different</i><br>
<i>&gt; memetic evolutionary pressures. Very fun, if you have a sense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kafkaesque humor. </i><br>
<p>
Well learn to get a sense of Kafkaesque humor if this goes on for much<br>
longer. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Something I think we european transhumanists should think seriously about</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is how we are going to deal with this. Eurosclerosis is a real danger to </i><br>
<i>&gt; us (just look at the european computer industry, or rather the lack of </i><br>
<i>&gt; it.</i><br>
<p>
I think that the best we can do is to spread the Transhuman idea, and then<br>
let people find out for themself why the EU is a bad idea.<br>
