In a message dated 97-01-24 02:20:01 EST, (certainly a man, but I am not sure<br>
which) writes:<br>

<i> &gt;This is exactly the kind of thinking I was talking about. I very much</i><br>
<i> &gt;doubt those tests (whiche were probably crafted by men, allright) were</i><br>
<i> &gt;designed to make women look bad. (Ok, just because you're paranoid it</i><br>
<i> &gt;doesn't mean they are really not after you -- but this _does_ sound</i><br>

 (Kennita replies)<br>
 I don't claim they did it on purpose or with malice aforethought.<br>

<p>
No she did NOT say that , or imply it in any way, and for whoever to deny it,<br>
 might show, either defensiveness, or an inappropriate guilt reaction.<br>
<p>
This post is interesting to me, because it draws attention to something which<br>
largely goes unnoticed and unacknowledged in this forum.<br>
<p>
There are at least are two seperate issues here: <br>
<p>
1.<br>
Scientific evidence sought and stacked to justify ( whatever group is doing<br>
the research's) status quo, vs.objective research which yields helpul<br>
solutions.<br>
<p>
2<br>
Certain environmental/economic/ social conditions which effect the status of<br>
both sexes in various ways, which has become known lately as "the battle of<br>
the sexes".<br>
<p>
<p>
Both topics are touchy and create much of the above type (not Kennita's the<br>
other one's) reaction, and a general defensiveness ( and sometimes even<br>
outright anger) on  both ends.<br>
<p>
It is an emotional topic and should be acknowledged as such, I am sick of the<br>
pretense of objectivity, when it is clear there's much "shooting from the<br>
hip" and name calling going on. <br>
<p>
Perhaps I too, have touched nerves, and had my hackles raised a few times<br>
over this, but at least I am honestly looking at this aspect of it.<br>
