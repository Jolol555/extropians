<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have noticed a few changes amongst my circle of friends after a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;years of being exposed to positive transhumanist modes of thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;and acting.  Their tolerance for negativity and useless bickering has</i><br>
<i>&gt;declined, we talk more about plans and dreams for the future, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt;have become more proactive about seeking out other positive individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt;for purposes of dating or friendship.  I have also noticed the quiet</i><br>
<i>&gt;movement from shelf to shelf of certain books and back copies of Extropy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I have seen the small changes within my employees and friends as I've<br>
exposed them to this mode of thinking, that is thinking like a<br>
transhumanist.<br>
bickering about useless stuff is not tolerated here. My partner in our bussiness<br>
hires many an AA member when we get big jobs building props or costume<br>
pieces for the studios. this exposes me to quite a cross section of<br>
humanity that has "slipped" on the path of life. quite a few of them over<br>
the years have been influenced by how I approach each new situation. which<br>
everyday around here is<br>
always something to keep you on your toes and thinking.<br>
keeping a positive out look and talking openly about Extropian values leads<br>
to some interesting conversations and alot of funny looks in my direction.<br>
but I've seen where it helps. exspecially me.<br>
I'm glad that Natasha likes to host parties cause that gives me a venue in<br>
which to bring in the people that want to know more.<br>
