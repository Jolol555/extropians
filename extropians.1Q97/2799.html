<i>&gt;Yes, you can contrive examples where markets perform less well  &gt;than an</i><br>

real world* (where nobody is &gt;omniscient).<br>
<p>
Sure i just meant to point out that a rational combination of the two could<br>
work better than either one on its own. Leaving some minimalized state-like<br>
instrument alive if you will, for those cases where the free market does<br>
fail. Some sort of guarantee rather than depending on a chance . But then<br>
again, maybe i'm still too 'convervative' ? ;-)<br>

<i>&gt;It seems to me that a vote is only valid if all the voters &gt;value the</i><br>

<p>
A pure free market system has the same problem. People with loads of money<br>
value that money much lower, than people with less money. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What do you mean "decide for"?</i><br>

<p>
Every item you buy, before i buy it, will become cheaper for me. Everything<br>
i don't buy before you buy it will be more expensive for you. <br>
<p>
Its a wonderful system, yet it's not without flaws.<br>
<p>
If you were as rich (or even richer) as bill gates, and you like 'egg in<br>
your beer', you could decide to buy 10.000.000 crates of it and give them<br>
away for free. The company that produces it will be able to manufacture it<br>
cheaper, maybe even cheaper than other 'beers'. Who knows, such an action<br>
may even result in other brands going bankrupt if its done well enough.<br>
<p>
I can still see where a complete free market system can become a system<br>
where the 75% masses become a toy for top 0.0001% of the rich. Now where<br>
does that leave all you second house, 4 mercedes families ?          <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	[...] Its the school book example of how the ducth state is justified:</i><br>
<i>&gt;	who else would build a dike to protect us from the sea ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maritime landowners?</i><br>
<p>
Excactly, combined with the soviet like collectives that will occasionally<br>
overthrow them.<br>
<p>
What a wonderful future: We get a choice between being exploited by the<br>
extremely rich, or a dictatorial collective instead of our current state.  <br>
<p>
Moderate 'social' measures have their function. They are to protect the<br>
part of the population that lies between that 75% and the top 0.0001% from<br>
excactly this.<br>
<p>
Bringing levels of organisation down to more local levels is ofcourse an<br>
obvious option for this 'class' in society. But IMO not a very good<br>
solution for the world, the economy and the future as a whole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When one rich man says no, maybe another will say yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;When the state says no, not only have you not got what you &gt;asked for, you</i><br>
haven't got your tax money either ;)<br>
<p>
True, which is exactly why i feel that just a much more minimalized state<br>
will do the trick. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do you believe in planners' altruism?</i><br>
<p>
No i don't. <br>
<p>
I don't know excactly what i am politically yet, maybe someone can tell me: <br>
<p>
I'd like to see a system with the highest level of individual freedom,<br>
combined with a free market economy, one where there is consent from the<br>
population through a far more democratic system than we have today, but far<br>
less bureaucratic and with a much less influencial state. BUT: With a swift<br>
and sure instrument left intact to act ONLY in crisis situations, with a<br>
rapid concentration of power and resources the scope of that which the<br>
Roman consuls had.    <br>
<p>
am i a democratic semi-anarcho/monarcho-capitalist ? <br>
