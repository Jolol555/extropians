<p>
WIth the background of space, anything only a few hours in space from<br>
earth surface would radiate a lot of IR.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Such weapons based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; moon with no atmospheric problems would be able to hit any target with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; lunar trajectory within 10,000 miles of leaving earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;How are you going to track a warhead with the cross-section of a marble</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from 240,000 miles away!?!?!?!?!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...Radar calculations and such...SNIP...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you increase the scanning rate you're more likely to detect it, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the detection range decreases because you put out less energy in each</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;scan. The crossover point where you're guaranteed to detect the warhead</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;before impact is at around 200m. That's about 33 milliseconds before</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;impact. It might even be close enough to the ground that I could</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;detonate the bomb anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Of course, I launched a thousand decoys with each warhead, so you have 33</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;microseconds to hit each one. Each one you miss is a 1/1000 chance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;losing your colony. How fast can your lasers retarget, and can they put</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;out enough power to destroy a warhead in 33 microseconds?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is all good and well, ASSUMING, that you are using radar sensing</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.  However, current state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensors for coast, reentry, and terminal phases *do not* use radar</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.  The current technology is also extremely capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; discriminating between dummy warheads and live ones.  The sensor technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; has an effective exoatmospheric (e.g. lunar) sensing range of thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Taking this into consideration, I would say the odds of a viable defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't so slim anymore.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...Terminal guidance et al...SNIP...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Given our 10 kiloton clean ferrous warhead (weighing one ton), we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; could decimate the world with 110,000 one ton ferrous rocks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;But this is the problem. I don't believe your figures, and still haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;had time to find an official 'J to MT' conversion rate. The two figures I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have handy are that the explosion speed of TNT is about 5500m/s and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something like 50g of antimatter is equivalent to 1MT. So that would give</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;figures of 0.5*5500*5500 = 1.5x10^7 or 0.1 * c^2 / 10^9 = 9x10^6 J per kg</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of TNT. So let's say 10^7 J/kg.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to ASTM E-380-82 of Standards for Metric Practice, one ton TNT</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear equivalent is 4.184^9 Joules.  This number is not the amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy in a ton of TNT (which, BTW detonates at ~7000m/s in most military</i><br>
<i>&gt; forms), but a standardized unit with a historical name.  In fact, one ton</i><br>
<i>&gt; TNT nuclear equivalent is defined as exactly 10^9 calories.</i><br>
<p>
I found a ref ona NASA page stating that one Megaton was 4.2 x 10^22<br>
ergs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Freefall velocity from the moon is around 11km/s, so a minimum energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;launch will give you 500 * 11000 * 11000 = 6 * 10^10 J. That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;equivalent to about 6 * 10^3 kg of TNT, or 6 tons. Hence, a thousand times</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;less than you claim. Sure you haven't got tons and kg confused?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A one ton ferrous rock is pretty small.  In fact, it amounts to a boulder</i><br>
<i>&gt; roughly 0.5-0.7 meters in diameter.  Therefore, it is not surprising that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; only has an energy yield of 6*10^10 Joules.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is quite small, and could easily be formed into the same<br>
stealthed shapes that Mark is puportin for nukes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Even if that's true, you now have to increase the figure to 6,000,000, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your total to 110,000,000. In my earlier message I showed that you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;launch 18,000 before forces arrive from Earth. Note, of course, that if my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;warheads can't target you at 6km/s, then your rocks will certainly not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;able to target me at 11km/s, and decimating the military will still leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;90% of them just itching to wipe you out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The fundamental problem is this: launching rocks from the moon gives you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;around a factor of four increase in energy from gravity. So you can put</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;four times as much energy into Earth as you can generate. In order to hit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the Earth with 60 MT worth of rocks you need to generate 15 MT equivalent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of energy. That's 15 * 10^7 * 10^9 J. With a 1GW reactor to power your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;100% efficient mass-driver that will take you about five years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;'Decimating the planet' with 1,100 MT will be impossible, because you'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;need a century to launch that many rocks, in which time the population</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would have increased by a factor of four.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
Considering that the Nuclear winter effects are caused by the dust<br>
thrown up, and that simulations have shown that a limited exchange of<br>
less than 10,000 kt would have significant environmental effects (this<br>
limited exchange was considered to be a strictly military conflict) I<br>
think your estimates are being inflated again simply to bolsteryour won<br>
position.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Just some quick comments on nuclear effects in the lunar environment:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I checked all my civil engineering books and others to get real figures and</i><br>
<i>&gt; data.  Assume a nuclear device with a yield of 1-Mt, which is a a few times</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher than the actual average yield of the current arsenal.  An airburst</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have virtually no effect in the lunar environment, so we will assume a</i><br>
<i>&gt; ground burst.  Assuming a theoretically perfect energy yield for a 1Mt</i><br>
<i>&gt; device, we have a total output of ~4*10^15 Joules.  However, the vast</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority of the energy is harmlessly radiated, since an atmosphere and</i><br>
<i>&gt; surface living is required for these effects to have significance.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; significant destructive force is the ground shock.  Note that much of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ground shock energy found in atmospheric environments is airslap induced</i><br>
<i>&gt; ground shock, and is therefore irrelevant.  I assumed a depth of 2-meters,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since soil arching plays a significant role in shock resistance.  After much</i><br>
<i>&gt; nasty calculation based on the above values, you will be disappointed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn that the safe distance from ground zero is between 500-1000 meters for</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 1Mt surface burst, depending on soil conditions.  The reason is apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; that virtually all the blast and cratering effects are consequences of</i><br>
<i>&gt; having an atmosphere, and soil doesn't propagate shock waves very well.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact, structures specifically hardened against nuclear blasts could survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite near ground zero, since non-airslap induced ground shock is attenuated</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely rapidly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that this is not an exact science, and that there are many factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved.  I was simply demonstrating that nuclear weapons lose most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their effectiveness in subterranean lunar environments.  Nuclear weapons are</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundreds of times more effective on earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Thanks for a more expert opinion James. Based on a reference I found of<br>
4.2 x 10^22 ergs per Megaton, I calculated 15 tons of TNT equiv. for the<br>
1 ton rock, so while I was seriously wrong in my own estimate, Mark was<br>
under by almost three times. I don't know why that number stuck in my<br>
brain, I had read it somewhere...<br>
<p>
Additionally, in terms of damage ability, large nukes have, even in<br>
atmosphere, an attentuating effectivness proportionate with their yeild.<br>
A 10 MT device will only have a damage area of between 4-8 times larger<br>
than a 300 KT device, which is why the powers have gotten away from<br>
using big nukes, as they are not as cost effective as using the same<br>
amount of material in four or more devices.<br>
<p>
For examply, a high altitude attack by 3-4 B-52s carrying conventional<br>
2000 lb HE bombs can damage as much area as a 10-20 KT nuke, though<br>
without the radiation effects. In fact, because the concussive<br>
shockwaves are from dozens of sources, rather than one device, they<br>
actually are more effective in their area of effectiveness.<br>
<p>
Also, as James demonstrated, a big nuke htting a lunar target would have<br>
much closer actual damage equivalence to a much smaller device hitting<br>
an earth based target. While I do not know how to calculate the actual<br>
or estimated equivalence, I think that this is a significant factor to<br>
consider.<br>
<p>
If we look at a more proportionate device, like the Oklahoma bombing,<br>
that device, I beleive was estimated to be equivalent to a ton of TNT<br>
(please correct me with more accurate data).<br>
