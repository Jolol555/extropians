In a message dated 97-03-25 04:22:06 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any<br>
 direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually<br>
 re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,<br>
 there are very few of those indeed.  I see absolutely no reason<br>
 why I should give any creedence at all to J. Random Ph.D. or<br>
 John Q. Bestseller. <br>

Lee, I wholeheartedly appreciate your comment.  So many people in our society<br>
today have "advanced" educations and such, but so few have any real knowlege<br>
that counts in helping bring about the world we want.  Not to mention how<br>
"educated" people often become so endoctrinated into the mainstream world,<br>
that they lose the ability to perceive correctly new concepts such as we<br>
Extropians hold.  I value open-mindedness more than education, and when you<br>
find someone with both, you most likely will end up with an Extropian.<br>
