From: John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Someday we will have one excellent theory of intelligence, but as for </i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness, well..., we'll have lots of them.  I don't see how it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever be possible to prove that one of those many theories was right and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; others were wrong, because the only consciousness you could experiment on</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the only one you know for sure to exist, your own, and that's not enough.</i><br>
<p>
An idea which is very common in science fiction is being able to directly<br>
experience another person's consciousness.  This may be done through<br>
telepathy, through mechanically assisted mind reading, through some kind<br>
of upload/download process; a hundred different methods have probably<br>
been described.<br>
<p>
Do you think it would ever be possible to do this, or does this seem like<br>
something which is fundamentally impossible?  If it could be done, then<br>
this could provide some insight into the nature of other beings'<br>
consciousness.<br>
