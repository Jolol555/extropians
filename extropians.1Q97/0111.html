        When someone looks at the concept of a 'teacher' in a school, the<br>
thoughtwave that usually occurs is of 'someone who conveys his or her<br>
aquired knowledge to students'.  Already there seems to be a little bit of a<br>
downfall for the students.  They automatically have the incentive to work<br>
for a higher<br>
source.  There is not enough freedom to question authority or tradition; if a<br>
student talks back, he is disciplined.  Early grade school (one teacher per<br>
year for all subjects) is particularly crucial to the student's inclusion<br>
into life.  The main problem that I foresee in the education system is the<br>
lack of freedom.  It is merely taken for granted that students must learn<br>
what is taught by 'the teacher'.  The step above 'the teacher' is, of<br>
course, the government.  'The teacher' is provided with 'an approved<br>
curriculum' of what the students 'should learn'.  Collective life skills.<br>
<p>
        We all know the ideal solution: downsize government.  Unfortunately,<br>
we (hopefully) are doing all we can about that right now.  Most of the<br>
geniuses who graced our world were once upon a time dubbed as<br>
'non-conformist' for their 'unorthodox' views on things.  Mozart, for<br>
example, snubbed the current king's orders when he wrote "The Marriage Of<br>
Figaro" and later wrote a German opera when asked to write one in Italian.<br>
Both pieces are immensely famous now, but at the time, Wolfgang was in a lot<br>
of hot water for 'not following orders'.  <br>
<p>
        So we're back to the problem at hand.  Modern people tend not to<br>
develop genius until they are later in age...if ever.  There is often a<br>
lasting stigma which stems from early 'teaching'.  Sadly, it affects the<br>
vast majority of our population.  Kudos to Eliezer and Wade et al for<br>
finding their geniuses at a young age.  As David Zindell would say:<br>
"Self-creation is the highest art."<br>
