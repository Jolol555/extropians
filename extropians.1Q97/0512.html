<p>
<p>
I don't think many governments are receiving much pleasure from the Internet<br>
these days. The only ones that have found a way to control it are some third<br>
world dictatorships, they just don't allow a Internet hookup and even forbid<br>
individuals from owning a computer. This works pretty well, and it works<br>
even better in guaranteeing that they will remain an economic and intellectual<br>
backwater forever. This solution doesn't seem practical in large industrial<br>
societies.<br>

<p>
<p>
Just because The laws of Nature say the speed of light is 186,000  miles per <br>
second doesn't mean the speed SHOULD be 186,000 miles per second. I wish the <br>
speed was higher, and that value for PI, 3.1415926535..., what a pain,      <br>
it should be exactly equal to 3. Government should change the law!<br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;government frequently attempts to do good things space travel </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
And we end up with a white elephant like the space shuttle.<br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;quick economic recovery, for example </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Politicians always come up with hair brained schemes that they say will move<br>
the economy in a direction that is good, the fact that it involves government<br>
work projects for their friends is pure coincidence and those who call it pork<br>
are being oh so very unkind.<br>
<p>
These Bozos claim they can steer an economy in any direction they want, just<br>
like a pilot can steer an airliner, it doesn't work.<br>
      <br>
We can design an airliner so we can make it  fly in any direction we want just<br>
by moving a few controls, but we can't do the same thing with an economy and <br>
point it in the direction of prosperity because nobody can understand the<br>
economy in which they live, the more they understand it the more they change<br>
it. Airliners are ridiculously simple machines compared a human being, and a<br>
human being is a ridiculously simple machine compared to a modern healthy<br>
economy.        <br>
<p>
You can control a plane because it has an enormous mass compared to air,  and <br>
it's moving at an enormous speed, and drag will not slow it to a stop because <br>
it has an enormous engine, so it's easy to make a prediction about how the <br>
plane will behave when the control surfaces are in a particular orientation. <br>
Also, when you learn more about the airplane that doesn't cause the plane to <br>
change. The idea that an equivalent economic machine could be built and that <br>
our fearless leader could  just "point and shoot" it in the direction of <br>
prosperity  and  provide individual freedom as a bonus is just plain loony.                 <br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;that would not happen in a free market. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I certainly hope not!<br>
                                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;sales taxes and income taxes are difficult to hide if</i><br>
<i>                &gt;one of the parties is a licensed business that must keep</i><br>
<i>                &gt;records and books.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Oh there will be plenty of records and books, but no way to check if they<br>
are correct. In the present day you can be sure that a supermarket did NOT<br>
pay it's wholesale suppliers in untraceable digital cash, the infrastructure<br>
for a large company to do such a thing just does not exist, YET. Because of<br>
this, the government could detect a discrepancy between what the store bought,<br>
what is still in the store, and the tax the store gives to the government. <br>
The government would then sue for back taxes and put the supermarket<br>
executives in jail. As for income tax, both I and the XYZ corporation I<br>
work for tell the government that I make $10,000 a year, we don't tell them<br>
about the other $200,000 they wire to my anonymous bank account.<br>
<p>
It's on a much smaller scale something like that might be happening now.<br>
Although I have absolutely no personal experience of this, and would never  <br>
dream of doing such an evil thing, I have heard rumors that even now private <br>
individuals sometimes agree to perform certain services such as home and <br>
car repair at a discount if they are paid in cash. I can only speculate as to <br>
why they prefer cash.<br>
 <br>
It would be the same with business income taxes. Many people might guess<br>
somebody was not paying their tax, they might have their suspicions, but in<br>
most cases very few would have an overview of the entire company and be able <br>
to PROVE how much in total the company bought and how much in total it sold. <br>
The number of people who could prove which individual was responsible for the <br>
company being in this illegal condition would be even fewer f not, evolution <br>
would favor smaller, smarter, more discreet companies.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying government will never make a conviction, small scale stings  <br>
would be possible, just as they sometimes stop drug smugglers, but its <br>
effects on the industry as a whole are nil.<br>
   <br>
So why can't we do this now, what more infrastructure do we need?<br>
 <br>
We need to set up digital banks that deal in anonymous untraceable cash <br>
using Chaum's protocol or something similar; the same could be said for <br>
credit cards and checks. <br>
<p>
We need to make untraceable petty cash safe, private and easy to use,<br>
this is very important because then government would be ignorant not <br>
only about what the store bought from its suppliers but also how much <br>
it sold to its customers. <br>
<p>
We need something like PGP's "web of trust" model, only larger and more <br>
robust, for reputations, then you could safely make loans even to <br>
anonymous pseudonyms. <br>
<p>
We need something more bulletproof than anonymous re mailers, it's not fair <br>
or realistic to expect operators of such services to long resist the <br>
enormous political heat that will be brought to bare, we need the true <br>
anonymity that DC nets can bring. <br>
<p>
We need to make strong cryptography easier to use and standards need to be <br>
set up and agreed upon by the business community. <br>
<p>
It might even be necessary to start a new currency but I doubt it.<br>
<p>
Technical solutions to these problems have already been found but putting  <br>
them into practice will not be easy and will take time. Government will try <br>
to stop it every step of the way with money-laundering laws, disclosure laws, <br>
"know your customer" laws  etc. Governments often try to fight economic trends <br>
but in the long run they never win, they can delay change but they can't <br>
stop it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;what is to prevent someone from setting up a government once </i><br>
<i>                &gt;your anarchy is established?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My Private Protection Agency. To be more precise, my PPA does not prevent<br>
someone from setting up a government, it just protects me from being forced <br>
to join it.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;John. What the Nazis did WAS essentially anarchic. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Anarchy means "no Government", although some prefer the term "no center".<br>
Using either definition, how on earth can you say Nazis Germany was an<br>
Anarchy? It sure as hell had a Government, and the strongest center of any<br>
society in History. By the way, I hope you don't infer by this that I'm saying<br>
any Anarchy will be a good one, nothing is always good. If you want an<br>
example of a nasty Anarchy, try a lynch mob, a much better example for your<br>
purposes. I should add that all the lynch mobs in history can't hold a candle<br>
to a few days work at one of the larger Nazi death camps.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;They illegally whipped up a bunch of support for executing </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the Holocaust. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Illegally? These monsters did not violate any law, at least none passed by<br>
Government.        <br>
                         <br>
<i>                &gt;Wealthy people, large groups, people with connections have</i><br>
<i>                &gt;exponentially more power than ordinary folks. With no laws</i><br>
<i>                &gt;regulating behavior, there is nothing to mitigate this power.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If Government is to protect us from the rich and the powerful then that means<br>
that Government must be even richer and even more powerful. Question: Who is<br>
going to protect us from Government which has exponentially more power than<br>
ordinary folks? Ask any of the many millions of people that Government has<br>
victimized, those that are still alive that is, and they will tell you the<br>
answer, NOBODY.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;People's wills and motivations are not driven by the amount </i><br>
<i>                &gt;of money you pay them. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then why do we pay the police?<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Look at you: no one is paying you to write these words. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What are you talking about? It's well known that everybody, every single<br>
person, receives 5 cents from the Extropian Institute for each word they post<br>
to this list, why do you think people include so much quoted material and<br>
have such long, long, signature lines? You mean they're not giving you your<br>
share when you post? Good heavens man, I'd be insulted if I were you, you<br>
should complain!                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Likewise, you don't have to pay soldiers much to beat people </i><br>
<i>                &gt;up.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Only when it's easy to do. In your other post you said you don't like it when <br>
people draw lessons from History, but you don't seem shy about doing it, so I <br>
will too. History has show that if you want your soldiers to revolt against <br>
you, especially in a dictatorship, the quickest and easiest way to do so is<br>
not to give your soldiers the pay you promised them. The dictator will tax<br>
everybody else without mercy to keep the military happy.<br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I don't recall the United States butchering hundreds of</i><br>
<i>                &gt;millions of its own citizens this century.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I do recall that less than 30 years ago the United States forced millions of<br>
its own citizens to go 12,000 miles from their home and then fight and often<br>
die in a idiotic war they did not believe in.<br>
<p>
If it makes you feel any better I will concede that if you ranked<br>
governments on a scale with demonic on the bottom and saintly on the top I<br>
would place the United States Government above 99% of all Governments that<br>
have ever existed. Do you really think this fact should make me look more<br>
favorably toward the idea of Government? The optimist says this is the best<br>
of all possible worlds, the pessimist says you're right.<br>
