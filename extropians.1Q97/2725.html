I asked:<br>
<i>&gt; Why do people seem so damn confident of their political opinions?   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste replied:<br>
<i>&gt;People are much more willing to use epistemic caution in debates where</i><br>
<i>&gt;they aren't afraid that they have a lot to lose, if they lose. The only</i><br>
<i>&gt;time I ever feel even *close* to the sensation that I am arguing for my</i><br>
<i>&gt;life is when I'm in political arguments. I've worn handcuffs, ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;People do not argue calmly when they are arguing about the rights and</i><br>
<i>&gt;responsibilities of the person who is holding a gun to their head, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that seems pretty straightforward to me.</i><br>
<p>
Calm vs. excitement is not the same as caution vs. confidence.  Why<br>
should being excited make you feel confident?  Any why would/does<br>
confidence help you win arguments?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ah, yes. Another answer to Robin's question is that our society is</i><br>
<i>&gt;permeated with the Dogma of Democracy, and the Dogma of Democracy</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that any randomly chosen citizen's opinion about a political</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue is exactly as valuable and likely to be "true" as anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;else's opinion of that issue. </i><br>
<p>
This seems to just restate the puzzle, rather than explaining it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ken Kittlitz replied:<br>
<i>&gt;... because politics (of some form) is inextricably linked with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;social structures to which they belong. That is, they perceive</i><br>
<i>&gt;politics having much more of a direct impact on their lives than</i><br>
<i>&gt;physics theories or formulae do, and hence feel they are in a better</i><br>
<i>&gt;position to comment on political issues.</i><br>
<p>
People believe that cars and planes have a direct impact on their<br>
lives, but view have much confidence in their opinions on what makes<br>
these safe/efficient etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another explanation might be that people figure that social/political</i><br>
<i>&gt;studies aren't really "science", in that the researchers are often</i><br>
<i>&gt;prevented by ethics (and law) from setting up the tightly-controlled</i><br>
<i>&gt;experimental conditions available to some other sciences.</i><br>
<p>
People are largely willing to defer to pychotherapists regarding the<br>
treatment of the mentall ill.  They also defer to geographers and<br>
astronomers, who can hardly control experimental conditions.<br>
<p>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker replies:<br>
<i>&gt;Physicists and programmers can readily point to simple, repeatable</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiments that conclusively demonstrate their principles.  </i><br>
<p>
Programmers?  Most people believe all sorts of crap that computer<br>
salespeople tell them, even though repeatable experiments often<br>
demonstrate the opposite.  The vast majority of programmer claims out<br>
there are of the form "We can write software to do X in Y months",<br>
which are rarely repeatably experimented on.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Finally, political ideas often rest on normative foundations, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;people with different norms will not agree, regardless of how much</i><br>
<i>&gt;deduction one does from them. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Individual liberty and responsibility are axiomatic values for me.</i><br>
<p>
Most policy specialists acknowledge that in fact most political policy<br>
questions end up turning much more on questions of fact than on<br>
fundamental normative disagreements.  Very few take your<br>
moral-axiomatic approach to politics.  I think the same response<br>
applies to E. Shaun Russell's reply:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;People must know where they stand in life --know what limits and</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedoms they accurately possess.  In application to libertarianism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;those who are at least in accord with the politic have no desire for</i><br>
<i>&gt;limitations in life.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am confident of my political opinions because I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;confident in myself --the broadest horizons are within oneself, and though</i><br>
<i>&gt;the stakes are high, it boils down to another question of faith or</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom...and I'll take the latter, thanks.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like you have faith in freedom to me.<br>
