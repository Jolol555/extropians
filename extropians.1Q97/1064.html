<i>&gt; Not at all. You really aren't thinking this through. using 10% more</i><br>

<i>&gt; well.</i><br>
<p>
No it doesn't, because L2 is behind the moon and L1 is in front. Now,<br>
launching towards L2 with a higher velocity might let the rock loop around<br>
back towards Earth, but there's no guarantee that it would actually hit<br>
the planet. There probably are trajectories that would work, but you'd<br>
have to be quite precise and your accuracy would be poor. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, considering the value of the L1 point, it would be silly to</i><br>
<i>&gt; not build the capability to send materials there.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what the value would be. Once you reach L1 you're basically<br>
at the Earth or moon, so I'm not sure that there's any benefit of having a<br>
station there at all. The only thing I could think of would be refuelling<br>
prior to lunar landing, but your station-keeping requirements at L1 would<br>
probably be so large that it would cost you far more than loading up with<br>
enough fuel prior to launch. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, say the lunar</i><br>
<i>&gt; govt as a prerevolutionary corporate cabal decides to build a launcher</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the FAR side, ostensibly to be able to send materials to L1 for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; station being built there.</i><br>
<p>
Then you'd probably be taken to court immediately for reckless<br>
endangerment. Anything stationary at L1 which loses station-keeping<br>
control will probably drop onto either then Earth or Moon. No-one will be<br>
happy about you putting a station in such a "fail-extremely-dangerous"<br>
location.<br>
<p>
Perhaps you could do this if you had a legitimate reason to use it to <br>
export materials to Earth, but that seems unlikely and I'm still not sure <br>
that people would be very happy about you doing so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The far side launcher is immune to direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; attack by earth, except by slow trajecotries that are detectable (less</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 100 miles above the surface) on the near side,</i><br>
<p>
Well, that depends... the main disadvantage would be that I'd probably need <br>
a rocket to turn the warhead around and fire it into the lunar surface. <br>
Bad, but not insurmountable. I'm not sure whether there is a direct<br>
trajectory from the Earth to the far side (I suspect there isn't), but if<br>
I'm going to have to use a rocket anyway I'd probably want to choose a<br>
course which leaves me travelling slowly a long way above the moon and<br>
come in from that side. Slower, yes, but I would have thought that that<br>
would take me further from the surface and make it harder to detect. <br>
<p>
Note that we've already demonstrated that you can't realistically attack<br>
the Earth with a mass-driver unless you have a massive energy-production<br>
facility, which is why you went over to near-earth asteroids instead. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So what is your point? Like I said, in order for earthgov to publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt; justify and get good PR for support of an attack on luna, the lunies</i><br>
<i>&gt; would HAVE to attack first, so as long as they don't the earthgov would</i><br>
<i>&gt; look tyrranical to do so or must fabricate evidence (Gulf of Tonkin</i><br>
<i>&gt; Incident).</i><br>
<p>
Really? If the lunies come out on TV ranting about attacking Earth if they<br>
try to stop their independence then the population will sit back and<br>
applaud? I suspect that the closest historical event would be the Cuban<br>
missile crisis, and although the US didn't attack Cuba they probably would<br>
have done if the Soviets didn't give in. <br>
<p>
Note that you've already said that if the US launched its space fleet to<br>
the moon as a blockade you'd shoot them down, so that I'd have to launch<br>
an attack directly from Earth. If you won't do so, then my fleet will be<br>
orbiting a couple of hundred km up and just itching to blow you up. <br>
Noone's going to complain about me enforcing UN-imposed sanctions against<br>
dangerous revolutionaries like yourselves, and if you attack we'll be<br>
forced to retaliate in self-defence. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now here's an additional argument why earthgov would WANT luna to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; independent: Forcible exile of prisoners or welfarees would constitute a</i><br>
<i>&gt; violation of human rights under the UN charter,</i><br>
<p>
Is this a penal colony or a corporate colony?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There you had a sovreign state invaded from the outside. On Luna you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the people exercising their UN recognised right of self</i><br>
<i>&gt; determination. Can't hardly bitch about that, can you?</i><br>
<p>
ROTFL... have you ever investigated the history of groups who claim their<br>
"recognised right of self determination"? History is full of fanatics who<br>
think that all they have to do is go to the UN requesting independence and<br>
they'll fall over themselves to give it to them. I mean many countries<br>
still haven't even accepted Taiwan as a sovereign state!!!!! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh you are so casual about it. The corporate way of doing it for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit are MARKEDLY different from the government way or the military</i><br>
<i>&gt; way. NASA takes 100,000 people to launch one rocket, while independent</i><br>
<i>&gt; launch companies use less than 100 to do the same job.</i><br>
<p>
Again, is this a penal colony or a corporate colony? If it's a penal colony <br>
then the government already have the launch vehicles to ship a million people <br>
to the moon, and a warhead is no big deal. If not, then they'll have bought <br>
them from corporations. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Also, the company that develops cost effective propulsion for such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; colony is NOT going to share it with NASA or any ohter competitor, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cost factors are completely different.</i><br>
<p>
Aha... so you have a monopoly on the technology, no competitors and refuse<br>
to sell it to anyone else? I might just as well claim that the USAF will<br>
lift off to bomb you from their captured alien saucers; it would be just<br>
as realistic. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And how do you think things will change in a luna scenario? rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypocritical. I think that your claims are rather specious given</i><br>
<i>&gt; people's aversion to using nukes. You really have NO IDEA of the ruckus</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a strategy will raise on earth.</i><br>
<p>
Even when you're threatening to drop rocks on Earth cities? How many<br>
casualties are people really willing to accept in order to not use nukes? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Additionally, people on earth and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the US will have relatives on Luna and wont be happy at all with</i><br>
<i>&gt; abandonment of their families. You really are rather blinkered.</i><br>
<p>
And people on Luna won't have relatives on Earth? So the lunies will be<br>
happy to destroy the Earth's cities where their relatives live, but the<br>
Earthers won't be willing to do the same? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now you are being insane. You don't know shit about war. The machines</i><br>
<i>&gt; COST MONEY. People pay taxes to build those machines, and don't like</i><br>
<i>&gt; them being wasted.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, you went from talking about 'cost' in terms of people killed to<br>
cost in monetary terms. I was still talking about the former.<br>
<p>
But people pay taxes to the government to protect them from lunies<br>
dropping rocks on their heads at thousands of meters per second. How many<br>
people really care if a cruise missile crashes as compared to a soldier<br>
being shot? Which costs more? People care much more about the lives of<br>
their soldiers than the cost of weapons. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You dont care because you don't know anything and are</i><br>
<i>&gt; just too stubborn to admit you are wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Does the word "projection" mean anything to you? I want to see if there's<br>
a realistic scenario for a war between Earth and Moon. Yours seems to rely <br>
on a) having a million people on the moon and b) the Earth governments having <br>
essentially no prescence in space at all. This is incredibly unrealistic <br>
*unless* there had been a general and dramatic reduction in the power of <br>
Earth governments. I certainly hope that happens, but don't see it in the <br>
next couple of decades. That would also seem to eliminate the neccessity.<br>
