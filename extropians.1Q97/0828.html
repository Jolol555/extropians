<i>&gt; You could be right.  I don't know enough about the Aquatic Ape theory</i><br>

I certainly see a use for bipedalism on the savannah, just look at<br>
meerkats. On flat plains with high grass, the higher you can stand, the<br>
earlier you get a warning of predators. Additionally, the ability to<br>
throw rocks and spears with decent power over decent distance also<br>
mandates an upright, high stance with a hip structure that also is<br>
conducive to bipedalism over quadupedalism. Those who could throw the<br>
spear the hardest and furthest got the best meat, and therefore were the<br>
alpha males that got to reproduce.<br>
<p>
This is a fine example of technology effecting evolution. Due to the<br>
computational demands of intuitive trajectory calculation, and the<br>
communication demands of hunting in teams or packs, lager brain cases<br>
were seen as an evolutionary advantage. WHile the analytical abilities<br>
of hunting were amplified in males, the females who had to look after<br>
offspring had to coordinate defenses against predators whil the males<br>
were hunting, so they developed better communication skills.<br>
<p>
Want to prove this is so? Try to teach a chimp to throw a 90 mph<br>
fastball on a major league field in the strikezone. It'll never happen.<br>
He doesn't have the hips for the job.<br>
