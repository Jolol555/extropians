Tom--<br>
<p>
(from "On the Importance of Silliness" off<br>
 <a href="http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage.HTML">http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage.HTML</a> )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suggest that &lt;EM&gt;humor, like inoculation, generates anti-memes&lt;/EM&gt;.</i><br>
<i>&gt;...I theorize that making a meme the butt of jokes transmits it in</i><br>
<i>&gt;enfeebled form....</i><br>
<p>
Are you (consciously) developing Minsky's "Jokes and the Cognitive<br>
Unconscious" (which is a development of Freud's ideas on jokes and<br>
"censors")?<br>
<p>
Immunity seems a richer metaphor than censorship, what with (as you<br>
say) weakened strains, and the web of mutually-triggering and<br>
mutually-inhibiting immunities.  The immune system *seems* to use<br>
populations of its own members as images of antigens, in order to<br>
remember them--kinda like your idea about jokes.  But also evoking the<br>
idea that even a good astringent can be poison in too strong a dose.<br>
(I'm reading and thinking about magic, innocence and enchantment right<br>
now--things that are sensitive to skepticism and being made fun of.)<br>
<p>
And now a memetic morsel:<br>
      ___       ___       ___       ___<br>
<i>| | | ___ | | | ___ | | | ___ | | | ___   --pattern in the heater grills</i><br>
<i>| | | ___ | | | ___ | | | ___ | | | ___     of Boston Red Line subway cars</i><br>
