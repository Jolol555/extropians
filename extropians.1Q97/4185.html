Yes. The spinal cord has a rather stereotypal structure, so most people<br>
involved with neurosuspension (and uploading) just think we could add on a<br>
new spinal cord using some future technology and have the person up and<br>
running. But there seems to be some evidence that even the spinal cord<br>
learns, which means that parts of our motor skills may be present down<br>
there. My guess is that we can create simple pattern generators over time<br>
for certain actions, although control and integration are done in the<br>
brain. Replacing the old spinal cord with a new might affect your motoric,<br>
and your body may feel slightly wrong. I admit that this is just a minor<br>
problem; I would accept being an upload with a slightly unfamiliar body<br>
model which I in time will learn to like, but if we could I think we<br>
should include the spinal cord in the suspension/upload. <br>
