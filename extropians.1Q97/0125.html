&lt;Fair point, I think.  Yet unless you give X-nity most of the credit <br>
for the Roman fall, Greek influence in Europe was probably in sharp <br>
decline anyway, waiting in Alexandria and the later Islamic empire for <br>
a<br>
resurgence.  As you say, it's unclear what a pagan and Churchless <br>
Europe would have accomplished.  I note that the Church did at least <br>
maintain a literate class and a common educated language, although <br>
that's tangential at best to my original argument about motivations to <br>
science.&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, I don't know about motivations toward science, but there is an <br>
editorial that the Wall Street Journal publishes every year on <br>
Christmas Eve, called "In Hoc Anno Domini", that makes the following <br>
interesting point about Christianity's effect on the development of <br>
human civilization:<br>
&lt;And the voice from Galilee, which would defy Caesar, offered a new <br>
kingdom in which each man could walk upright and bow to none but his <br>
God ... So the light came into the world and the men who lived in <br>
darkness were afraid, and they tried to lower a curtain so that man <br>
would still believe that salvation lay with the leaders ... [And even <br>
the disciples of Christ were afraid] that men might yield up their <br>
birthright from God for pottage and walk no more in freedom.&gt;<br>
<p>
This was something new (though probably derived from the Greek <br>
traditions): that every person could be the equal of a king, that God <br>
was something beyond the latest divine ruler, that there might be a <br>
rule of law rather than a rule of men, that all men could be equal <br>
before God/Nature regardless of their tribe or nation.<br>
<p>
Once that libertarian meme began to spread, it was only a 'short' leap <br>
from 'bow to none but God' to bow to nothing but the laws of nature <br>
and your own creativity. It is important to distinguish these original <br>
ideas from their later cooptation and corruption by the rulers and <br>
their church. However, it's doubtful that they could have spread as <br>
they did without the mechanisms of religion and conquest - perhaps the <br>
libertarian meme had to hide like a virus and ride out these other <br>
plagues in order to spread and firmly establish itself.<br>
