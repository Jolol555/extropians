Greg, your problem seems to be a language/concept artefact, you're mixing <br>
the abstraction layers. If you think computer, you instantly see a <br>
particular machine, programmed in a particular way. It's seseless to seek <br>
emotions, or hydrodynamical shockwaves in flipping bits, as trying to <br>
find emotion in spiking neurons. It's an activity pattern, a physical <br>
process occuring in the exquisitely structured space slab between your ears.<br>
<p>
A computer simulation of a particular physical system has a degree of <br>
equivalence. If we're just after information about that peculiar system, <br>
information extracted is perfectly valid in the real world. Unless you are a <br>
part of the simulation (imagine the Universe, observers included, being <br>
sucked into your computer in a solipsistic implosion, we wouldn't even <br>
notice), you need I/O to be able to interface (look and tweak) with it <br>
at all, of course. <br>
<p>
A perfect simulation of the photosynthesis process won't feed anyone in <br>
the real world directly. Yet ANN-controlled agents moving in a spatial <br>
ALife simulation, looking for food and enemies look very much alive to <br>
me. Primitive, yet clearly alive. I wonder how an orthodox Brahmin <br>
must feel when cutting juice off a long-evolved ALife ecosystem. <br>
Technically it would be inconsistent behaviour, looking at your toes for <br>
fear of crushing bugs, yet carelessly flipping off the switch. <br>
<p>
Good thing thinking is mostly about processing information, and sensors and <br>
actuators easy to come by. Evolving agent behaviour in a robot colony is <br>
actually easier than to simulate it, because correct physics of a <br>
nontrivial dynamic structure assembly is terribly expensive (in terms of <br>
computer horsepower, and code complexity) to do.<br>
<p>
Attaching particular values to certain physical processes is merely an <br>
artefact of the observer. You are within the you-system, that's why you feel <br>
about love, and pain differently. Torturing uploads by tweaking their <br>
R&amp;P system representation is a crime, even though in cyberspace no one <br>
hears you scream.<br>
