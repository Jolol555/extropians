<i>&gt;I love the tropical island idea!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How long will it take until everybody will afford a wall-sized display</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a live ocean, and a network connection to deliver it? 10 years?  15 ?</i><br>
<p>
I would guess not that long from now. With the coming of lower cost<br>
flat-screen displays and the merging of the TV and PC we'll see it pretty<br>
soon. Add in 400kbps DSS Satellite internet access and you're right on the<br>
money. Next they'll have underwater cams of black smokers w/tube worms,<br>
jungle cams, all sorts of stuff and with VR goggles you could have all<br>
these cams in stereoscopic vision. How about cams in the jungles of New<br>
Guinea so you can help spot large undiscovered mammals?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Hmm... I can just sit closer to my display now.</i><br>
<p>
Are you referring to a tropical beach or a nude tropical beach? :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And I do have a T3...) </i><br>
<p>
oh! oh! I want one!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for Augmented Reality, I would love to see my friends sunbathing on</i><br>
<i>&gt;that sand, and my beach towel near them.</i><br>
<p>
Imagine changing all the textures of objects inside your home. Instant<br>
interior decorator! Make that old wooden stairway appear as black marble.<br>
Superimpose a mercury or firey texture over the ocean. An easy transition<br>
into the uploaded realm. You could have your PDA builtin to your AR<br>
goggles, see in infrared, nightvision, ultraviolet. Pave the streets with<br>
advertizing. You could personalize any aspects of the AR template that you<br>
wished but the default ones would be transmitted to you by short-distance<br>
radio communications. The world will look so incredible being able to add<br>
any texture, paint a house with a texture and never need to repaint. All<br>
this could be created with a pair of cheapo AR goggles using a blue screen<br>
effect just as people are currently pasting virtual ads on telivision<br>
sports games.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By the way, the Venice beach is dark now.  A streaming video with a 12</i><br>
<i>&gt;hour delay would make it look a lot better.  Time machine?  I could also</i><br>
<i>&gt;rewind the waves on that beach if they are recorded, or fast-forward them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What would you like to see?</i><br>
<p>
I like Mike Lorrey's idea of a webpage containing cams from beaches across<br>
the globe so you can always see summer. It would also be great for surfers<br>
to locate the good waves.<br>
