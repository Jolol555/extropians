 Hal Finney expressed his scepticism regarding David Musick's claims to<br>
 effectively retrain his mind.<br>
 Hal, you have every right to be sceptical, considering the difficulty<br>
 in proving the objective and impartial assessment of a subjective <br>
 exercise.<br>
 David, I have no doubt that you've accomplished just what you've claimed,<br>
 and we've touched onto these very pursuits in past dialogue.  As stated in<br>
 my 'Twisty's FAQL' (<a href="http://www.twisty.org/twistfaq.html">http://www.twisty.org/twistfaq.html</a>), I would have<br>
 continued to be little more than a daydreamer until I *chose* to value<br>
 my skills in math and science more.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Math is something I really enjoy doing, so I've done a lot of work </i><br>
<i>&gt;with that, and my mathematical abilities are significantly greater </i><br>
<i>&gt;than they ever have been.  The complexity of problems I'm able to </i><br>
<i>&gt;solve and the speed with which I'm able to solve them keeps increasing </i><br>
<i>&gt;the more I practice my math skills.  After a while, I start picking up </i><br>
<i>&gt;on little tricks and shortcuts and develop more advanced thinking tools, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and problems start seeming a lot easier.  Also, just doing some problems </i><br>
<i>&gt;makes it easier to do similar problems.  </i><br>
<p>
 Great stuff, these optimizations.  When sixth grade introduced me to <br>
 algebra, I pounced upon it like a ravenous wolf... It fit well with <br>
 my sense of spatial flow and relational sequence.  Since preschool I've <br>
 exhibitted strong skills in 'Visual Reasoning,' but I had so badly <br>
 neglected my math until the fifth grade that I am still below average <br>
 speed in arithemtic. Yet optimizations have improved my skills since my <br>
 days in Junior High.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I'm working on now, with my math, and this can be applied to lots of </i><br>
<i>&gt;other areas too, is to stop hesitating so much between steps.  I have the </i><br>
<i>&gt;unfortunate habit of interrupting myself when I am working on a problem and </i><br>
<i>&gt;pausing frequently.  I want to train myself to just do the problem straight </i><br>
<i>&gt;through, in one swift, fluid motion.  It is hard for me to break this habit, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but I am getting better, and I am getting faster at solving problems, as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;result.</i><br>
<p>
 I think much of the learning optimization process is a matter of <br>
 converting the 'relationships' of one's knowledge.  When one learns <br>
 to drive, for example, it is difficult to relate the process under <br>
 one's inexperience.  You memorize several proceedures, and hope not <br>
 to confuse the brake pedal for the accelerator.  Yet under a little <br>
 on-road experience, you relate things more to patterns.  You find it <br>
 easier to forecast the behaviors of other cars, and your ability to<br>
 control your own vehicle becomes 'second nature.'<br>
<p>
 The difference in method is much like in computers:  It is very <br>
 inefficient for a system to reload a program every time it has to<br>
 print one character on the screen.  Instead, you change the approach.<br>
 You learn to keep the program in RAM.  You learn to print sequences <br>
 or strings of characters instead of one at a time.  You undestand<br>
 the behaviors of objects, and the relationship of what comes before <br>
 and after. The results can increase performance manyfold.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Regarding the second question; yes, some cognitive abilities are harder </i><br>
<i>&gt;to improve than others.  Generally, when I'm not very good at something </i><br>
<i>&gt;and don't have much experience using an ability, it is very difficult to </i><br>
<i>&gt;improve my ability.  But the more I work at it, the easier it gets to </i><br>
<i>&gt;improve my ability in that area.  From watching myself, it seems like </i><br>
<i>&gt;learning a new ability is very much about creating an internal language </i><br>
<i>&gt;that is appropriate for that ability.  At first it takes a lot of </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience to even find general principles which are accurate, but once </i><br>
<i>&gt;those are noticed, they become symbols and it becomes easier to think </i><br>
<i>&gt;about an analyze the ability.  As more experience is gained, my internal </i><br>
<i>&gt;vocabulary regarding that area of ability continues to grow and my </i><br>
<i>&gt;internal dialogue becomes more and more complex in that area and it </i><br>
<i>&gt;builds on itself faster.  Also, I start seeing relationships between </i><br>
<i>&gt;what I am learning in one area and what I have learned in another area, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and I can transfer the old knowledge to the new area.  By the way, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;internal language I develop when I learn new things is very different </i><br>
<i>&gt;(at least superficially) to spoken language; there are no sounds to </i><br>
<i>&gt;represent the symbols, so they are not anything I can communicate </i><br>
<i>&gt;easily to other people, but I know what I mean when I think them.</i><br>
<p>
What you've just described is quite familiar to me, although I don't have<br>
much trouble recounting my own process of discovery, so it makes it<br>
easier for me tutor others in what I've experieced.  The mind sees<br>
likenesses and differences, causes and effects.  The greater its store of<br>
knowledge, the easier it can draw associations and relationships between<br>
experiences.<br>
<p>
Here are a few optimizing methods that have improved my skills by<br>
changing the relationship of knowledge:<br>
 o  DRAWING/ART:  Imagine the product you desire, as if its<br>
    already completed on the canvas.  Now just *trace* your imagination.<br>
    Increased experience under this approach will improve your results.<br>
    Imagine every last detail, so that you can envision the strokes<br>
    required to *turn* the medium *into* the final product.<br>
    If you must contend with human error or flaws in the medium,<br>
    just envision turning the 'bugs' into 'features.'<br>
 o  SETS:  As we move from the Industrial Age into the Information Age,<br>
    we move from fill-in-the-blank forms to list processors.  A blank<br>
    labeled 'Occupation' need not hold a single item, but could hold a<br>
    subset of the many hats you wear, or 'emptyset'.  Set Theory can<br>
    improve understanding of Geometry, Music, Interpersonal <br>
    Relationships, and more, when one comes to realize that not every <br>
    blank requires just a single property.  This should be taught in <br>
    grade school, or sooner.<br>
 o  RIGHT/LEFT BRAIN: There are two sets of mind that should be recognized<br>
    in learning... First is Discerning Logic, focussing on differences <br>
    however subtle.  This often (yet innacurately) called Left Brain<br>
    thinking.  Logical, Lingual, and Legalistic, it deals with sequences,<br>
    protocols, and rules, and is often triggered by intollerance of<br>
    a difference.  The other is Emotional, Instinctive Pattern-Matching,<br>
    associating likenesses however improbable.  This 'Right Brain' mindset<br>
    is the 'fuzzy logic' patterning engine that is often found in<br>
    creative arts and 'religious experiences.'  Problem-Solving is<br>
    a bridge between the two, causing both to work in concert to seek<br>
    causes and effects, drawing hypotheses by 'inducing' like-behaviors,<br>
    and narrowing conclusions by deducing which causes are eliminated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that every cognitive ability can be improved </i><br>
<i>&gt;significantly with practice.  The level of difficulty seems to </i><br>
<i>&gt;depend on how familiar one is with the ability and with how </i><br>
<i>&gt;strongly one is motivated to improve it.  Also, it depends on </i><br>
<i>&gt;how appropriately one goes about improving the particular ability; </i><br>
<i>&gt;each one requires a different approach to improve.</i><br>
<p>
The older we get in our adult lives, the fewer graycells we have left, yet<br>
the more associations we can continue to learn.  Our faculties don't <br>
seriously diminish until there is serious injury or until we just get <br>
complacent with oversimplified and incompleted thoughts. (ie television?)<br>
<p>
Like driving, the rules and exceptions to rules start out quite unfamiliar. <br>
It requires exercise in order to cause the patterns of rules to surface.<br>
Their relationships and associated patterns become more familiar,<br>
increasing one's pattern store and knowledge base.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; -- Learn to look at the world as though you are an alien, seeing </i><br>
<i>&gt;everything for the first time. --</i><br>
<p>
Funny you should mention this... I happen to be part of 'the Klingon Assault <br>
Group,' a Star Trek Fan Organization.  (<a href="http://www.kag.org">http://www.kag.org</a>)  The unusual <br>
thing is that I think Star Trek kinda sucks, growing entropic with age, <br>
but the original vision of tolerance, diversity, and acceptance is kept <br>
alive in the Fan Community. (Does that make me a 'Social Trekker?')<br>
<p>
To me, the real fun of Role Playing a Klingon (or Cardassian, Narn, <br>
or Vorlon) is the act of losing one's inhibitions, and perceiving Life<br>
through the eyes of an Alien.  There is a delightful objectivity that <br>
results.  (Or perhaps it's more the cause than the effect.)  When one <br>
plays a Role, particularly one defined by what you are NOT, it gives <br>
one a 'professional distancing' from yourself.<br>
