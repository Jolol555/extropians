Still CD technology was developed to store only what the human ear can hear.<br>
In order to save storage space, all low frequencies, the human ear cannot<br>
hear were left out. Frequencies that you do feel, when they're being<br>
reproduced, and that influence those that lie just above. Mini disc and DCC<br>
work with storing only the dominant tones in a certain frequency range,<br>
discarding a number of other tones in that range. Still nobody will have<br>
noticed the difference, or say the sound is less 'emotional', this is what i<br>
meant in the example, an uploaded human personality with a percentage of<br>
loss, might be acceptable to some. The height of that percentage depends on<br>
the individual value of both their personality, and the possible benefits<br>
from such a technology.      <br>

<p>
hmmm, in the techno community i know many people who had nasal surgery, but<br>
probably for different reasons...<br>
