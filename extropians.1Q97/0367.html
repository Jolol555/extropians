<p>
        Personally (and it is merely IMO) I think that random sampling only<br>
works to an extent.  Random sampling leaves a very wide margin of bias<br>
unless the sampler makes it clear about the circumstance in which he tested.<br>
In de Garis' case, if I am to accept that his 'estimation' is random<br>
sampling, I'd like to see who and what he tested.  What kind of statement is<br>
'5% of all geniuses are women'?  It is impossible for him to prove this<br>
statement unless he asks *all* geniuses.  Either that, or I'd like to see<br>
*how* he tested these people.<br>

<p>
        The term 'genius' unto itself is fairly subjective: what one person<br>
sees as as 'genius' may not be what another sees...which is probably your<br>
point.  I (again, IMO) don't think there is any limit (other than those with<br>
debilitating mental disorders etc.) to the amount of potential geniuses on<br>
this planet.  I see many members on this list as geniuses.  The question is<br>
this: should there be some collective definition or test of genius?  Does it<br>
truly matter that my 'Intelligence Quotient' is 156?  I've learned important<br>
things from simpletons and geniuses alike; one could argue that *everyone*<br>
is a genius in his or her own way.  In the same effect, one could argue that<br>
there is *no such thing* as 'genius'.  I don't think that it is so much what<br>
one knows, or the capacity one has to learn, but what that person does with<br>
what they have.  Do they maximize their ability?  Do they enjoy life for<br>
what it is worth?  That, to me, is much more important in labelling genius<br>
than judging one by his or her aquired knowledge or experience...regardless<br>
of gender.<br>
