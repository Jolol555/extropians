In a message dated 97-03-10 16:33:59 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 My compliments to Natasha, as opposed to E. Russell, for her calmness in<br>
 this debate.  But I'm afraid that here I have to agree with a literal<br>
 reading of Carwash: "making the extropians concepts ... LOOK like<br>
 scifi."  Nanotech may not be scifi, but associating it with posters<br>
 showing people with skin of pure silicon may well cause people to think<br>
 of nanotech as pulp scifi.  Johnny Carwash being an existence, although<br>
 not a frequency, proof.<br>
 <br>
 Why would you want a silicon, or silicon-compound, skin anyway?  If you<br>
 have that kind of tech, and want semiconductors in your skin, use<br>
 diamond circuitry.  Much more useful would be diamondoid plates.  Or<br>
 perhaps buckyhair.  How does buckyfiber rate on the Kevlar scale?  For<br>
 more decoration, artificial quartzes, corundum, or diamond, with<br>
 impurities in some particular pattern.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I have not been even trying to be calm ( in fact i am quite pissed off about<br>
the whole thing) and applaud Natasha for being so diplomatic. But the main<br>
concern for artists here is that Extropians are being censored. <br>
Are we only allowed to publish nonfiction now? Is sci fi not to be considered<br>
Extropic? When did this occur? Who will decide what art is correct? IMO, it<br>
should be the free market.<br>
<p>
 A good calm discussion would be lovely, redining and honing the artist's<br>
ideas until they cwith more scientific realities... but that  was not<br>
apparently what Mr. Carwash" had intended, and Natasha quite obviously<br>
returned the debate to that level. Your post, for example,  is quite polite,<br>
helpful, and suggestive. But the dirisive and insulting language that was<br>
aimed at Natasha's piece ( which if anyone bothered to read tha post was<br>
based on an image honoring her father) did not seem to be positive or<br>
uplifting, it actually belittled and abused. She chose not to respond in that<br>
manner. <br>
<p>
Now he backtracks and says it was constructive, but let's try and not confuse<br>
Natshasha's natural grace with the actual intent.<br>
