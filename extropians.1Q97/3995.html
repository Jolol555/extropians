Open Air Space Habitats (excerpted) <br>
 <br>
    A home in space need not be the enclosed volume usually described <br>
in most movies, books and articles  <br>
[McKendree]. If a strong enough material is used, a rotating cylinder <br>
can be so large that it holds an entire  <br>
atmosphere against its inner surface. One example of this is Larry <br>
Niven's "Ringworld", a ring the diameter  <br>
of Earth's orbit, circling a sun, and wide enough to contain oceans and <br>
continents [Niven]. It, and similar  <br>
proposals [REF], unfortunately have to be built of "Unobtainium" to <br>
perform this mighty feat. <br>
     We now have a material close at hand that can do something like <br>
this, albeit on a much smaller scale. The  <br>
smaller the diameter of the rotating ring or cylinder, the less demands <br>
are put on its main structural material.  <br>
Instead of encircling a star, we can now contemplate building <br>
artificial worlds with land areas comparable to  <br>
Earth that are open to space- a feature we've grown accustomed to on <br>
this world. <br>
     This fabulous new material is the long sought Carbon-Carbon chain <br>
molecule. Its existence was posited  <br>
several decades ago, but no one knew how to make it. The answer turned <br>
out to be one of those delicious  <br>
tales of scientific discovery, like Goodyear stumbling on <br>
vulcanization. We've come to know of a "third  <br>
form" of pure Carbon, not diamond nor graphite. This "new"-to us- stuff <br>
is called Buckminsterfullerene, or  <br>
Buckyballs and Buckytubes. Now that we know what to look for, this <br>
stuff has turned up in four billion year  <br>
old meteorites  interstellar gas clouds, and right here on Earth: in <br>
ordinary candle soot, where it was  <br>
discovered occurring naturally]. <br>
    With the clarity of hindsight, it is obvious that a "sheet" of <br>
ordinary graphite could be rolled up and joined  <br>
to form tube- I'll wager someone thought of it many years ago. What is <br>
amazing about this is that it happens  <br>
all the time, naturally. Now comes the hard part- make the tube really, <br>
really long, and do it at hundred  <br>
thousand ton per second rates. The "really long" part is being avidly <br>
pursued, and we might see meter-long  <br>
samples this year (1997) [Smalley]. This in turn may well spawn an <br>
industry that replaces "Carbon Fiber"  <br>
with the real thing. The first products will probably be military, <br>
aerospace and spacecraft parts, as was the  <br>
case with Carbon Fiber. Then come the bicycle frames, tennis rackets, <br>
golf  clubs and such. These products  <br>
will weigh perhaps half of an equivalent Carbon Fiber part. More <br>
importantly, they establish "Buckyfiber" as  <br>
a viable, nanotech industry. <br>
    To make this material in the quantities we really want, some parts <br>
of the production have to be done by  <br>
self-replicated tools, or 'Special Assemblers". The nice thing about <br>
"Graphenes" (Buckytubes) is they self- <br>
assemble to a large extent (cf.  "candle flame"). Therefore, the <br>
Special Assembler does not need to do direct,  <br>
positional-control chemistry on the forming tube, it only needs to <br>
mediate, or catalyze, the process, and  <br>
move the finished end of the tube along and out of the way, where more <br>
conventional machinery can  take  <br>
over. Since this is essentially a one-dimensional product (like wire or <br>
yarn), the Special Assemblers can be  <br>
arranged in a plane, with the Buckyfibers emanating perpendicular to <br>
that plane. <br>
     Given the above capabilities, we can now speak of creating new <br>
worlds. In this example, we'll make a  <br>
2000 kilometer diameter world, just for fun. A space-based industrial <br>
capacity, having the tremendous  <br>
resources of just the inner Solar System at its disposal, along with <br>
some nanotech self-replication  <br>
capabilities, can do this kind of thing. <br>
    Beginning with the alluded to giant spools of Buckyfiber, a <br>
cylindrical structure can be "filament-wound"  <br>
in deep space. To do this, one need a rotating mandrel, or round mold, <br>
to wind the fiber onto. This can be  <br>
made in several different ways. One is to start with a long, thin, <br>
superconducting wire, formed into a loop,  <br>
and charge it with an electric current. It then naturally springs out <br>
to form a near-perfect circle. Using  <br>
several of these connected together in a row, and reinforced with <br>
Buckyfiber-cloth, makes a short cylinder,  <br>
say 100 meters long by 2000 km diameter. This now can be brought up to <br>
some rotational speed in several  <br>
ways. One efficient way is to build two worlds at the same time, <br>
spinning in opposite directions, and use a  <br>
motor between them. <br>
    The gathered ends of Buckyfibers are led off of the spools (which <br>
are also spinning) and brought to  <br>
rendezvous with the outer surface of the spinning hoop. The shell is <br>
wound to a thickness of perhaps a few  <br>
centimeters. Depending on the masses (moments of inertia), allowable <br>
fiber tensions, rotational speeds of the  <br>
hoop and spools and so on, the hoop can be made to slow down as the <br>
fiber runs out. Now the supercurrent  <br>
is quenched, allowing the mandrel to go somewhat slack (it still has <br>
some centrifugal force pushing it against  <br>
the new Buckyfiber cylinder). The mandrel is released from the inner <br>
surface of the new cylinder wall, and  <br>
moved along another 100 meters or so, like a concrete slip-form. <br>
Another gang of Buckyfiber spools is  <br>
brought  in and the process repeated. After doing this a few hundred <br>
times, we are left with a big, thin,  <br>
slowly spinning cylinder, say 500 km long and 2000 km diameter, having <br>
over three million square  <br>
kilometers of new land- about 2% of Earth's land area. This now can be <br>
used as the mandrel for the rest of  <br>
the construction. <br>
   Leaving this cylinder spinning slowly, we bring in fleets of these <br>
Buckytube spools. The fiber should be  <br>
wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees, which means we need a <br>
shuttle, like on a loom. This might have  <br>
to be a rocket propelled craft looming over the new world, like a <br>
Shuttle. Another way is to build a 500  <br>
kilometer beam with the shuttles on it that sits in space next to the <br>
cylinder. The shell needs to be perhaps 15  <br>
meters thick for structural reasons, and another three meters of slag <br>
might be sprayed on the outside, for  <br>
radiation protection. The atmosphere-to-be will provide the same <br>
radiation protection topsides that Earth's  <br>
air does. <br>
   As we wind the main bulk of this world, we have to consider what to <br>
do about the ends. As this is an  <br>
"open-air" design, the ends only have to come up from the cylinder wall <br>
about 200 kilometers, and can be  <br>
very thin near the top, as will be the enclosed atmosphere. These end <br>
walls can be made by wrapping the  <br>
fiber over the edge of the cylinder, letting it run in a straight line <br>
for a ways across the open end, then  <br>
wrapping back up onto the cylinder. Using a thin plastic membrane <br>
across the end, with a small amount of  <br>
air inside for pressurization, can help make the end rounded, as they <br>
ideally should be. <br>
After the main shell is built, the rest of the atmosphere can be <br>
brought in, the nitrogen and oxygen distilled  <br>
from asteroids and cometary nuclei. Oceans are easy; there is lots of <br>
accessible water ice strewn about in  <br>
asteroids and small moons, out past Earth's orbit. These will have to <br>
be shallow seas, though, unless the  <br>
shell is made very thick under them. Mountains ranges might be added to <br>
the ends, where the walls rise to  <br>
hold the atmosphere. <br>
   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, meaning each point on the interior living  <br>
surface has about 200 Km of atmosphere above it, and then 1600 Km of <br>
nothing. Looking upward, at an  <br>
angle, one can still see the stars. <br>
    Daylight can be either provided naturally, using a suitable <br>
arrangement of mirrors, or artificial. The design  <br>
presented here uses one or more artificial suns rotating above the <br>
atmosphere at a slower rate than the  <br>
habitat is spinning, so as to give a 24 hour day. These lights need <br>
about a million megawatts (a terawatt) or  <br>
more of electricity to power them, which might be provided by <br>
photovoltaic cells covering the exterior. For  <br>
positions farther from the Sun than Earth is, this power source can <br>
also be augmented or supplanted by off- <br>
World Solar Power Satellites beaming energy back to microwave antennae, <br>
as well as separate mirrors to  <br>
increase the energy reaching the solar cells. To keep the lit portion <br>
of the ring from lighting up the nightside,  <br>
a shade is included as part of the rotating artificial sun system. <br>
   So where should we put our new World? If you're like me, you will <br>
want it very far from Earth. The first  <br>
candidate places are at the Sun-Earth L4 and L5 points, where it will <br>
stay put without any control needed.  <br>
These places are 60 degrees ahead and 60 degrees behind Earth, in Earth <br>
orbit. This gives us a fairly  <br>
comfortable 150 million kilometers between ourselves and the nearest <br>
politician, but we can do better: there  <br>
is no reason to remain in Earth's orbit, either literally or <br>
figuratively [Heinlein]. <br>
    Moving closer to the Sun has the advantage of increased solar <br>
energy density, and not much else. Out  <br>
past Mars are the serious resources of the solar system, and of  the <br>
rest of the Universe. Jupiter's L4 and L5  <br>
(also called Trojan and Greek Points) points are great candidates; they <br>
are easy to get to from Jupiter's  <br>
moons and from the main Asteroid Belt, and also have the distinct advantage of holding substantial materials  <br>
in their sway already, perhaps even rivaling the Main Asteroid Belt itself [Lewis]. They are part of the "high  <br>
ground" of the Solar System, more easily defended against attacks from Earth's gravity well. An interesting  <br>
property of these Trojan Points is their extent- they have a very large volume of space around them in which  <br>
objects can "orbit" without leaving the vicinity of the Point. <br>
Asteroids can be brought into the Point,  <br>
flattened out and made to orbit the New World, if needed for passive <br>
defense against matter and energy  <br>
beams. <br>
    Maintaining a large fleet of space warships is much easier on this <br>
type of world, as the gravity well is  <br>
much smaller. A ship can leave the Spaceworld with only a few meters <br>
per second needed for escape  <br>
velocity. Military bases placed on the spin axis can service quite <br>
large warships using raw materials from the  <br>
Solar System at large, and finished products from the New World. Access <br>
to the base is a matter of a quick  <br>
elevator ride from the surface. The aforementioned terawatt of electric <br>
power for lighting can also be  <br>
diverted to some nasty-big lasers and such, big enough to vaporize a <br>
ship many millions of kilometers away. <br>
    This Spaceworld is curiously resistant to nuclear weapons. With a <br>
safety factor greater than three, a hole  <br>
blown in the side would not enlarge, and the outgassing of the <br>
atmosphere would carry away the fallout (at  <br>
some point the hole should be repaired to keep the rest of the <br>
atmosphere in). <br>
    A nanotech 'cordon sanitaire' can be established around a <br>
space-based habitat much more readily than on a  <br>
planet by tracking and identifying all objects in its vicinity. <br>
Microscopic nanoprobes might be dealt with by  <br>
maintaining an ionizing field around the habitat, such as a scanning <br>
ultraviolet laser, perhaps backed up with  <br>
a layer of free floating "nanobot-phages" orbiting just outside the <br>
World. <br>
   A magnetic field can be added to this world without much further <br>
effort by wrapping superconducting  <br>
wire or film around the circumference to form a current loop [Lorrey]. <br>
The resulting magnetic dipole field  <br>
would deflect the solar wind much like Earth's magnetic field protects us from these charged particles. On  <br>
Earth, these particles are entrained in the magnetic field, bouncing back and forth between the North and  <br>
South Poles, creating the Auroral Lights. The cylinder has no atmosphere at its "poles", so the particles can  <br>
either be allowed to circulate through the center of the cylinder (forming a sort of ionosphere), or collected  <br>
and stopped by charged plates at either end of the spin axis. <br>
   Well, that was a lot of effort, but how much is a World worth? <br>
 <br>
Space Warfare <br>
 <br>
   So. How do we defend all this stuff? You might have noticed above <br>
that practically everything mentioned <br>
in the Interworld Rapid Transit System [Bishop] works just as well when <br>
"fired in anger". The traffic <br>
control, pointing, tracking and ranging systems, as well as Smart <br>
Pellets, are virtually identical to those <br>
required for space warfare. Indeed, I got the idea for Smart Pellets <br>
from the "Smart Rock" kinetic kill <br>
projectiles of the US Star Wars program. <br>
    A really large Spaceworld, like the "Open Air Habitat" would have <br>
production, material and energy <br>
resources far in excess of Earth's, along with perhaps an "Interworld <br>
Rapid Transit" Station or some other <br>
type of spacecraft support systems at its disposal... <br>
