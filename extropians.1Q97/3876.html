Since I have already perfectly wasted this early<br>
Saturday [IRQ] make that Sunday afternoon as well [RTI]<br>
afternoon, I could as well go on. This rant will be<br>
hopefully more focused (though _which_ focus I am still<br>
at loss to decide), less generic.<br>
<p>
Well, I _am_ currently in the process of getting a life.<br>
For almost two months now I am doing -- of all things<br>
-- vehicular embedded programming, in a secondary<br>
outsource tributary to Bayerische Motorenwerke, a<br>
Kraut car manufacturer. This is both bad and good.<br>
<p>
Bad, since lots of transhumanist-value-set people seem to be<br>
accumulating in an IT-related job sink, with all the strings<br>
attached (being restricted to a peculiar activity type, and<br>
presenting an only-too-convenient external classification<br>
handle (not a _scientist_, just an another IT professional,<br>
you see, so you can safely redirect whatever he says<br>
<i>&gt;/dev/null)) but maybe that's an artefact of observing</i><br>
only net-visible transhumanists/extropians. I suppose<br>
there is a whole non-wired world out there. (It has<br>
been rumoured there _is_ one). Well.<br>
<p>
Good, since distributed realtime embedded systems are<br>
likely to play a large role in future infrastructures,<br>
whichever, you pick your choice. Everything concerning<br>
desktop machines, networks, and physical agentry. Current<br>
CAN embeddeds and embedded-DSP hybrids seem to herald<br>
this. Industrial programming is pragmatic (which is also<br>
both good and bad, since one rarely has to combat ivory<br>
tower-attitude, but otoh cannot hover over a single project<br>
indefinitely, polishing it to perfectness past recognition),<br>
and one has often to touch hardware. Now controlling<br>
nontrivial (since heterogenous and/or multiple) hardware,<br>
reliably, _and_ in realtime, is interesting. It both<br>
helps to contain age-related creeping dementia, and<br>
allows one to acquire a set of possibly useful skills<br>
for the interesting times we are purportedly have to<br>
face soon.<br>
Or so I hope.<br>
<p>
(Another good thing is that the outfit I am currently<br>
with also does diverse things like simulation, emulation,<br>
testing systems (cum GUIs), virtual machines, and the like,<br>
so one will probably rarely get bored; but I digress).<br>
<p>
I discovered there is no freedom in the academia, and none<br>
outside of it. In the academia, even postdocs bend to the<br>
whims of the head of the lab they work in, and by time they<br>
had progressed to the stage of being able to define their<br>
own research topics, they discover they're semi-burnt-out<br>
elderly ex-researcher-now-administrator-types. Gawks. So<br>
the only way you can influence what you do is by travelling<br>
long, hard and frequently, and polishing a lot of brass<br>
doorknobs to bright sheen, besides. It also helps being<br>
very very good.<br>
<p>
In the industry you also fail to be self-determined. Large<br>
outfits, very like brontos in tar pits, are boggled down with<br>
overhead. Flat structures all and well, but you still hark to<br>
your chef, and he to his, and so recursively upwards. In small<br>
outfits, customer, especially Large Customer, is King, and the<br>
only thing left to you is which customer you do choose. (If<br>
you reject too many of them in a row you might face some<br>
terminal cash problems). It also helps being very very good.<br>
<p>
Anyway, here's a list of random observation I'd like to<br>
commit to my hard drive/modem lest they fade from memory<br>
altogether (though stale already, since past the fresh<br>
impression stage ). I'll be hopping from tier to tier<br>
incoherently (this is a rant, no?), so bear with me.<br>
<p>
First, a short sketch of the outfit I'm currently with.<br>
It's quite small, being 8 persons in toto, of which two<br>
work constantly off-location. There is no regular working<br>
hours, but those cooperating with BMW must be available<br>
during certain hours (09-17), since these guys work only<br>
at these fixed time. Occasionally, some of them are<br>
working at home. Working on weekends is not exceptional<br>
during high load time.<br>
<p>
Since it's a mass-market (&gt;100 kUnits, I am speaking of<br>
the large-company-related business thread) there is no<br>
inflation in the hardware performance as witnessed by<br>
PCs: the embeddeds utilized are 68HC11xxx derivates, a<br>
time-honoured 16-bit Motorola product line (for the curious:<br>
these are custom versions like EA9, P2, etc.) Paying a<br>
programmer for several weeks to optimize away some 1 kByte<br>
seems to pay on the short run, as even $0.10 amounts<br>
accumulate if mass-produced. Let's face it, the customer<br>
is conservative. Even worse, he is sometimes randomly<br>
stupid (a random bigwig adhocery, deciding "we need that<br>
feature").<br>
<p>
Due to inefficiences of large car manufacturers, radical<br>
(EV) designs from small outfits ought to have distinct<br>
advantages on the market. (Their big disadvantage will<br>
be absence of serious cash (both for R&amp;D and marketing),<br>
so their possible success will be depedant on risk<br>
capital venture's wisdom). I am thinking about ZEV<br>
legislation in California here.<br>
<p>
Backwards compatibility is a must, so though a CAN<br>
trend is firmly there, older families must still be<br>
supported for the next decade, or so. Vehicular digital<br>
electronics seem to also suffer from creeping featuritis,<br>
as even more microprocessors, sensors, buses, and<br>
actuators are pressed into the high-end vehicle. This<br>
contributes to a mushrooming power drain, which demands<br>
bigger on-board generators, larger batteries, more<br>
space to accomodate the gadgetry, and larger motors.<br>
(In short, this is a dog. For a person, who has waited<br>
for the advent of 100-kg, compound-frame, methanol<br>
reformer PEM fuel cell, regen braking, motor-in-the-wheel,<br>
for the past decade, despairing by increments, this is<br>
the very antithesis of the trends extrapolated. Another<br>
sad confirmation to the so-called free market's failure<br>
to provide technically decent solutions, due to average's<br>
customer dire stupidity). &lt;/diatribe&gt;<br>
<p>
Moreover, it tends to increase the system's brittleness,<br>
since a software defect may jam (since shared) bus traffic,<br>
drain the battery overnight due to failure to go to sleep<br>
mode, and to switch off, etc. Interesting is a trend to<br>
multiple, intravehicular heterogenous packet-based<br>
networks: Kbus, MIbus for the steppers, Diagnosis-Bus,<br>
now CAN, etc. This requires the use of (part-time)<br>
intelligent bridges, which do packet translation,<br>
sub-net broadcasting, and trivial routing. There is<br>
no obvious trend towards optical LANs, albeit<br>
vehicular environment to be heavily EMfected.<br>
<p>
Stepping back a step; two trivial observations: a) that the<br>
vehicle is starting to resemble one's habitat ("my car is<br>
my castle"), and b) its intelligent networks increasingly<br>
look very like that of an animal. A fully autonomous<br>
vehicle is not an mid-80's pipe dream, anymore. Further,<br>
gauging from past trend, we are likely so see downscaling<br>
of high-end features into the mid- and low-end niche.<br>
Moreover, distributed realtime control systems from the<br>
car, are likely to spill over into the house automation,<br>
the next Big Thing after the PC.<br>
<p>
Considering a (yet hypothetical) wearable, it might also<br>
vastly profit from these developments. I am particularly<br>
heartended to learn of book-sized methanol direct<br>
metabolizing fuel cells currently being developed, of<br>
about a 50 W/unit performance. I dunno how you feel,<br>
but I consider inability of accessing one's well-configured<br>
environment to be maddening. Portables, and palmtops are<br>
both inadequate. Two diametrally differing solutions seem<br>
possible: everybody runs Win2000, and carries his frozen<br>
configuration state on a solid-state card, or plucks it<br>
from net home node, whether over wire link or cellular.<br>
Or, verey like a hermit crab, one carries his working<br>
environment with him. Since the latter version speaks<br>
contra microsoftian monoculture, I vote for the latter<br>
option.<br>
<p>
Tasks diversity considered, like head-up video, GPS<br>
and inertial navigation, biotracking, power management,<br>
voice recognition, IrDa, cellular modem, nonvolatile storage<br>
unit, and generic computation (secure comm link, digicash,<br>
...), this asks for a distributed realtime embedded<br>
solution. (What fun! Next thing they'll be asking will<br>
be an active exoskeleton). Anybody is already doing<br>
this? If not, they should.<br>
<p>
that's enough for today,<br>
ciao,<br>
