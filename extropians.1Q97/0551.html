11.6.1 Conducting paths<br>
<p>
a. Conductivity   As the diameter of a wire becomes comparable to the<br>
electron mean free path, surface scattering can increase resistance to<br>
above the value suggested by scaling laws and bulk resistivity. This can<br>
be avoided by supressing surface scattering. In particular, structures<br>
can be chosen that have matching lattice spacings across the interface<br>
between metal insulator, measuring the spacings along the axis of current<br>
flow (matching usually requires strain). Electrons with wave vectors that<br>
enable propagation without reflection from metallic lattice planes will<br>
then experience no degradation of their longitudinal momentum as a result<br>
of diffractive scattering from the metal-insulator interface; in the<br>
longitudinal direction, specular reflection will dominate.<br>
<p>
Doped graphite and organic polymeric materials can exhibit conductivities<br>
comparable to or greater than that of copper (Kivelson, 1988). Organic<br>
polymeric materials such as doped polyacetylene are termed<br>
quasi-one-dimensional conductors and presumably show little degradation<br>
of conductivity through surface scattering.<br>
<p>
By engineering semiconductor structures with suitable band gaps and<br>
doping patterns, conducting filaments can be constructed that are narrow<br>
enough that electron wave functions having a transverse node are<br>
substantially higher in energy that those lacking a transverse node.<br>
These filaments, termed quantum wires, strongly suppress the small-angle<br>
scattering processes that dominate the degradation of electron momentum<br>
in ordinatry conductors; they can accordingly exhibit unusually high<br>
conductivities (Sakaki, 1980; Timp et al., 1990).<br>
<p>
Experimental and theorectical work on conducting polymers and other<br>
low-dimensional conducting structures suggests that eutactic electronic<br>
structures can be built that provide conductive paths of substantially<br>
lower resistance than would be estimated from their dimensions and bulk<br>
metallic resistivities. Indeed, it is conceivable that the ability to<br>
build a far wider range of metastable structures will lead to the<br>
discovery of superconductors with critical temperatures substantially<br>
higher than those now known. [...]<br>
<p>
b. Current density   In integrated circuits, high current densities can<br>
cause electromigration, in which metal is redistributed from one region<br>
of a conductor to another, eventually breaking circuit continuity. This<br>
phenomenon limits acceptable current densities.<br>
<p>
Electromigration results from biased diffusion of metal atoms and<br>
vacancies, chiefly along dislocations and grain boundaries. It is<br>
strongly suppressed in fully-dense, single-crystal metallic structures<br>
where the energy required to form a vacancy is large (e.g., &gt;150 maJ in<br>
Cu). The required energy is still larger if the displaced atom cannot<br>
occupy a normal lattice site (in a slightly expanded crystal), but is<br>
instead forced to occupy a high-energy interstitutional site.<br>
Accordingly, a single-crystal metal wire surrounded by a strongly-bonded,<br>
lattice-matched sheath should be stable at far greater current densities<br>
than a conventional wire of the same material. The structural stability<br>
of (some) conducting polymers should likewise minimize electromigration<br>
and similiar phenomena. [...]<br>
