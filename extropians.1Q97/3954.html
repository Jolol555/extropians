Just read an interesting book: "Derrida for Beginners," by Jim Powel.<br>
It's in comic-book ("Cartoon History of") style.<br>
<p>
Now if Postmodernism is as closely linked to "deconstruction" as I thought,<br>
this is very interesting.  Max says-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I spent this past weekend at a conference in Munich, Germany discussing why</i><br>
<i>&gt;Europe is undergoing a "Big Fatigue" while the USA seems so much more</i><br>
<i>&gt;vibrant...</i><br>
<p>
The thing is that this book says that, "Soon (early '70's) the American study<br>
of deconstruction eclipsed its French following, spreading...to revolutionize<br>
and politicize literature and humanities departments nationwide, then<br>
worldwide."<br>
<p>
So American academics have aparently had a big hand in this stuff.<br>
(*Smack!*)  Could it be that America as a whole hasn't fallen into the<br>
spell because America ignores its academics?  Not sure how happy I am<br>
about that.  Or is it that we're much quicker to get the point, especially<br>
of an anti-establishment, anti-tradition idea, rather than belabor it?<br>
Another pair of quotes: Camile Paglia: "America doesn't need<br>
deconstruction." Derrida: "America *is* deconstruction."<br>
<p>
Deconstruction has something to do with people undermining their positions<br>
(if you analize with eyes crossed, thumb up nose) by the very concepts<br>
or distinctions they use to support their positions.  Like the way that<br>
Ayn Rand would say you *had* to believe her prejudices because in order<br>
to argue against her you had to employ them.  Only the opposite.  I mean<br>
deconstruction is stranger, but I didn't like how Rand wired her basement<br>
either.  Me for say it straight, even if you're talking about something<br>
crooked.<br>
<p>
Two things I did get out of this book.  Now I'm more willing to think "It's<br>
a French (or Euro, or Academic) thing."  Instead of being an incisive<br>
analysis that turns the world on its head, it's more like a critique of<br>
stodgy smarty-pants French/Euro/Academic philosophy done in a stodgy<br>
smarty-pants way.  (A friend (in the mid-80's) said he made some puns in<br>
French to some French people and they were astonished--they don't *do*<br>
puns.  But Derrida is like puns flogged beyond death.)<br>
<p>
The other thing is the Structuralism/Post-Structuralism riddle.  It's not<br>
that these were two generations of French/Euro/Academics.  Rather, Claude<br>
Levi-Strauss came up with Structuralism, which caught a bunch of hopeful<br>
enthusiasm, ONLY TO BE IMMEDIATELY TOPP(L)ED by Derrida (in a lecture at<br>
*Johns Hopkins*), giving birth to "Post-strux".  So these people seem to<br>
have been flitting after fads, except the deconstruction fad lasted about<br>
20 years (~'66-'87).<br>
<p>
I suspect it has to do with the Marxists' desparate need to escape the<br>
middle-class Ideology they assume they're under the spell of.  I mean<br>
*there's* a Big F...atiguing meme to be suffering under.  For me,<br>
deconstruction makes cracks, but not *treads*.  No traction.<br>
<p>
Yet in FrancoEuroAcademe it does seem to cling tenaciously.  Maybe<br>
some sort of memetic evolutionarily stable strategy niche thing.<br>
You have to be there...?<br>
<p>
But then, the idea that *Those people's ideas are irreconcilably alien*<br>
is a self-promoting divisive Fatiguing idea in itself.<br>
