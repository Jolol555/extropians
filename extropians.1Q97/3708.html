I don't know how shrinkable the brain is, but being the brother/collaborator <br>
of an Amiga demo programmer I know that a clever hack can achieve plenty <br>
of compression if you have the basic algorithm right. I'm fairly sure <br>
that once we have suceeded at uploading, we will gradually find ways to <br>
shrink the upload matrix.<br>
<p>
Back to the subject: I think the truth is somewhere between Eugene<br>
(neurons are tricky, simulate them all as carefully as possible) and John<br>
(neurons are important mainly in groups) - neurons indeed do a lot of<br>
amazing stuff, but they also work together in populations. Evolution would<br>
favor beings whose minds had a fair bit of redundancy over beings where<br>
every neuron matters (in situations where brain damage is likely during<br>
the lifetime of the being). So Eugene is pointing out an upper bound to<br>
upload matrix capacity, while John is speaking of the "compressed"<br>
brain-algorithm (where we can chunk neurons). <br>
<p>
As a neural networks/neuroscience person I would guess that these new<br>
properties would not increase the upper estimate with more than a<br>
magnitude. If we assume 10^11 neurons with 10^4 synapses each, and 100<br>
parameters in each synapse (I'll chunk the synapses and dendrites they sit<br>
upon into one unit here), we get 10^17 state variables. Nonlinearity,<br>
dendritic computation and similar stuff just makes calculating the next<br>
state more heavy, and doesn't increase the storage needs much. Each<br>
update, (say) every millisecond might depend on the other states in each<br>
neuron + signals from connecting neurons, giving around 10^26 flops. <br>
Diffuse modulation doesn't increase the estimate much. Of course, this is<br>
a very rough estimate and should be taken with a large grain of salt. <br>
