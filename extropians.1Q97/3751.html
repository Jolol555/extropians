I heartily agree with TOMorrow on this one!<br>

You're missing the point here. If a person lives within a culture where<br>
no-one has ever even suggested the world to be round, that person is every<br>
bit as objective as you in his/her acceptance of the flatness of the world.<br>
Whilst I agree with you that reasonable, Western people would accept the<br>
roundness of the world, I can't accept your exceptionally blinkered of<br>
culture as simply being "Western, post-Enlightment rationality = reasonable<br>
and objective, everything else = unreasonable and subjective". I guess that<br>
just the anthropologist in me coming out.<br>

<p>
Just to make the point one more time: fairy tales are perfectly reasonable<br>
sources of objective facts in those cultures where there are no other<br>
opinion-systems to be heard. Objectivism is, I have said before, defined<br>
as, simply, listening to what others said and assigning them a greater<br>
priority than what oneself thinks.<br>

<i>&gt;Each generation is accepting of less and less mystification of things.</i><br>

Each generation has more information.<br>
<p>

<p>
Nor does it stop the current scientific use of art.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If it [art]is not a source of truth or facts, then is it a source of untruths</i><br>
<i>&gt;and non-facts?</i><br>
<p>
No, that's an entirely spurious logical extrapolation. Art is a source of<br>
discourse, which may or may not reveal truth or facts, or may do both. A<br>
drawing of a flat Earth presents both a possible truth (this artist<br>
believes the Earth to be flat) and a possible not-truth (the Earth is flat).<br>
