<i>&gt;One of Koch's postulates is that you should be able to cause the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;disease by injecting the supposed agent into a new victim.  Obviously, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;has been tough to prove with HIV because nobody wants to volunteer as a test</i><br>
<i>&gt;case.  However, recently chimpanzees injected the human HIV virus have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;coming down with AIDs like symptoms, declining T-cells, and at least one</i><br>
<i>&gt;appears to have died of the disease.  The latency period is every bit as</i><br>
<i>&gt;long in chimps as it is in people, making these difficult and expensive</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiments to carry out.  But they now appear to satisfy the most important</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Koch's postulates.</i><br>

I'd appreciate it if you could reference this new chimp study. I'd particularly<br>
like to read about HIV infected chimps coming down with "AIDS-like <br>
symptoms" after latency periods "every bit as long as it is in people."  <br>
I would like to read it since it is so at odds with earlier experiments I am <br>
familiar with.<br>
<p>
These past studies reveal important differences in the diseases of<br>
infected monkeys from that of HIV in human AIDS:<br>
<p>
(1) The absence of antiviral antibodies predicted the incidence of diseases<br>
in monkeys, while the opposite is claimed for humans infected with HIV<br>
[Kestler et al. 1990].  Another study has confirmed that monkey's risk<br>
of disease is directly proportional to the titer of SIV [Futz et al., 1990].<br>
<p>
(2) The simian retroviruses barely reduce the T-cell levels of ill monkeys<br>
[Kestler et al., 1991], while HIV is claimed to deplete T-cells in humans.<br>
<p>
(3) The spectrum of diseases observed in the SIV-infected monkeys is<br>
different from AIDS, including bacteremia and lacking, among others,<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma and dementia [Kestler et al., 1990; Fultz et al., 1990].<br>
<p>
(4) In follow-up studies, SIV failed to cause disease in rhesus and <br>
mangabey monkeys despite extensive sequence variation of the virus <br>
which is thought to enhance pathogenicity [Fultz et al., 1990; Burns<br>
and Desrosiers, 1991; Villinger et al., 1991].<br>
<p>
(5) Since SIV has never caused any disease in wild monkeys, although<br>
about 50% are naturally infected [Blattner et.al, 1988; Fultz et al., 1990;<br>
Burns and Drosiers, 1991; Villinger et al., 1991] it is not an appropriate<br>
model for the hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS in naturally infected<br>
humans.<br>
