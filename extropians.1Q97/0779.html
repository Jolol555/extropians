<i>&gt; &gt; I think you misjudge sensor technology.  Military IR sensor satellites in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; geosync orbit (~40000 km) can detect fractional degree changes at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resolutions of something like 10 meters on the planet surface.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The question would be, how large an area are they scanning at any time? A</i><br>
<i>&gt; one degree temperature difference over a ten meter square should give you</i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe 500W at the surface. So that would imply that those satellites could</i><br>
<i>&gt; detect my warhead at about the same distance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So if they're scanning the whole sky at once and still getting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; resolution, then that's a problem, but if they're only scanning a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; square kilometers at a time then it will take them a significant amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; time to spot the warheads and they'll be unable to track more than one;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even radar would work if you already knew where the warhead was to within</i><br>
<i>&gt; a few kilometers. Imaging something you already know the location of is</i><br>
<i>&gt; much, much easier than finding something in trillions of cubic kilometers</i><br>
<i>&gt; of space.</i><br>
<p>
What is important to acknowledge is that the Clementine probes main<br>
mission for BMDO was to prove that these sort of sensors could lock onto<br>
and guide a craft to near earth asteroids, which are millions of miles<br>
away. If they can do this, then finding a body reflecting solar flux in<br>
cislunar space is a piece of cake...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, decent signal processing will be able to pick out small, weak,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; differential IR sources against the backdrop of a spinning earth, since its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; behavior would distinguish itself from an earth based IR sources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *If* they know roughly where it is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (unqualified) theory is that when you have a flux overload, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; superconductor would start to heat up.  At a certain temperature point, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would resume an entirely ceramic nature, which would then be unaffected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; EMP.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah, I don't know what would happen either. However, all that energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have to go somewhere, and it would probably end up in heat. Even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; that didn't happen, having gigavolts running unexpectedly through the</i><br>
<i>&gt; control hardware would be annoying, to say the least.</i><br>
<p>
What is the situation with superconductors and EMPs? I thought that they<br>
did not conduct magnetic fields at all, just current? Also, you would<br>
think that the forces that an induction gun are built to would be in the<br>
range synonimous with nuke EMP type flux levels. I'll have to study my<br>
Pulse Power handbook I got from BMDO.<br>
