                 Wednesday, 8 January 1997<br>
                 Post No. 7 of 8<br>
                 by David Korten <br>
<p>
                 Steve, trying to hide the<br>
                 fact you're an economist<br>
                 won't work. As soon as a<br>
                 woman realizes you believe<br>
                 rejecting reality will make<br>
                 it go away, she'll know<br>
                 immediately.<br>
<p>
                 The importance of<br>
                 information does not make<br>
                 corporate power and our<br>
                 ultimate dependence on the<br>
                 planet's life-support<br>
                 systems go away. And just<br>
                 because the ideologues of<br>
                 global capitalism avoid<br>
                 mentioning class and power<br>
                 doesn't mean that they<br>
                 don't exist in a capitalist<br>
                 system.<br>
<p>
                 My Webster's dictionary<br>
                 defines capitalism as "an<br>
                 economic system<br>
                 characterized by private or<br>
                 corporate ownership of<br>
                 capital goods." A<br>
                 capitalist is a "person who<br>
                 has capital," "a person of<br>
                 wealth." Simply put,<br>
                 capitalism is an economic<br>
                 system ruled by people with<br>
                 lots of money.<br>
<p>
                 The world's 358 capitalist<br>
                 billionaires have a<br>
                 combined net worth of<br>
                 US$760 billion - equal to<br>
                 the total annual incomes of<br>
                 the world's poorest 2.5<br>
                 billion people. Prepare for<br>
                 a shocker, Steve. Global<br>
                 capitalism is not<br>
                 classless! And the power of<br>
                 global megacorporations is<br>
                 used by capitalists to<br>
                 exert control over<br>
                 ever-expanding portions of<br>
                 the global economy. They<br>
                 monopolize information,<br>
                 limit the availability of<br>
                 competing products, dictate<br>
                 cultural tastes through<br>
                 media control, and buy<br>
                 politicians to rewrite laws<br>
                 in their favor.<br>
<p>
                 You don't think<br>
                 corporations plan their<br>
                 global expansion? Attend a<br>
                 board meeting of the<br>
                 Campbell Soup company.<br>
                 Corporations aren't<br>
                 rewriting the rules to<br>
                 create a global economy?<br>
                 Check out a meeting of the<br>
                 World Trade Organization.<br>
                 Or just read the business<br>
                 press.<br>
<p>
                 Steve, let's get to the<br>
                 heart of the matter. The<br>
                 Bionomics Institute falls<br>
                 into the classic trap of<br>
                 libertarian think tanks<br>
                 funded with corporate<br>
                 money. You don't<br>
                 distinguish between freedom<br>
                 for people and freedom for<br>
                 megacorporations. You even<br>
                 reject the idea that a<br>
                 corporation is an<br>
                 authoritarian system of<br>
                 organized economic power -<br>
                 a reality as obvious to<br>
                 most people as the need to<br>
                 have land, water, and<br>
                 sunlight to grow oranges.<br>
<p>
                 Steve, you'll be startled<br>
                 to learn that I am also a<br>
                 libertarian and an advocate<br>
                 of market economies.<br>
                 However, as did Adam Smith,<br>
                 I recognize the difference<br>
                 between a healthy market<br>
                 economy comprised largely<br>
                 of small, local enterprises<br>
                 serving local markets and a<br>
                 diseased market economy in<br>
                 which a handful of<br>
                 megacorporations grow like<br>
                 a spreading cancer sucking<br>
                 the life from people and<br>
                 nature. Is the disease<br>
                 running out of control? You<br>
                 bet it is. And the patient<br>
                 is dying.<br>
<p>
                 It is within our means to<br>
                 create healthy market<br>
                 economies that work for all<br>
                 the world's people without<br>
                 destroying the planet's<br>
                 life-support system. For<br>
                 concrete ideas on how, see<br>
                 the final chapter of When<br>
                 Corporations Rule the<br>
                 World. Though it won't be<br>
                 easy, we can and must<br>
                 eliminate the cancer and<br>
                 reorder our economic<br>
                 priorities. The first step?<br>
                 Stop rejecting reality.           <br>
<p>
Comments?<br>
I found one fat error: comparing the ASSETS of the 300+ richest people<br>
to the ANNUAL INCOMES of the worlds poorest 2.8 billion people. Apples<br>
and oranges. THose people live in nations where personal property is not<br>
recognized as a human right, so they consequently have ZERO assets with<br>
which to build lives with. <br>
<p>
He correctly identified the mercantilist/government collusion that goes<br>
on daily. However his prescription of "STOP REJECTING REALITY" is about<br>
as vague as Schroedingers Cat.<br>
<p>
Anyone else?<br>
