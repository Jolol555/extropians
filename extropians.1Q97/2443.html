Your facetious definition of what a universal Schelling point might be<br>
sparked my interest to think about it further. Humor is often employed<br>
in order to glaze over seemingly absurd, paradoxal, or complex ideas;<br>
sort of like a defense-mechanism. If we laugh at something, make humor<br>
of it, we no longer feel necessitated to explore it further. We can move<br>
on without be troubled by it further. I'm not saying this was the case<br>
in this situation, but after reflecting on just what might entail a<br>
Schelling point, I found it to be fairly difficult to pin down. We can<br>
all imagine Schelling points, e.g., if you lost your child at an<br>
amusement park, they would probably turn up at either the entrance or an<br>
information booth (assuming average intelligence), but how do both the<br>
child and parent come to this conclusion if the subject was not brought<br>
up beforehand? The difficulty here seems to lie in the fact that though<br>
many points can be ruled out via reason alone, we would use our<br>
intuition to make the final decision. But then, what is intuition? Seems<br>
like another tool for glazing over a complex issue, sort like the word<br>
'instinctual' or superinducing 'God' into an argument. Intuition in this<br>
case is refering to the empathy we must have for the other individuals<br>
involved. After ruling out the majority of points via reason, we must<br>
imagine which of the remaining points would be most sensical to the<br>
others while keeping in mind that they are probably thinking the same in<br>
relation to us. This sounds a lot like chess to me. Seems to be one of<br>
the fundamental issues that still separates a human player from a<br>
computer. Computers have several ways of attempting to attain intuition,<br>
e.g., probability, fuzzy logic, etc., but all of these methods seem to<br>
lack variables for the human psyche. Even if a computer can learn<br>
certain idiosyncracies about its human opponent, the computer can only<br>
apply what it has learned to the specific "game" it is playing. If the<br>
computer has no record of the player trying to find a Schelling point in<br>
Paris, the computer will not be able to create an isomorphism [as<br>
defined by Hofstadter] between the game it knows and the "game" of<br>
finding a Schelling point in Paris based on what it has learned about<br>
the human player. It seems however that humans do have this power, the<br>
ability to apply learned patterns to new circumstances. I imagine the<br>
Schelling point test would be an incredible way of testing an AI.   <br>
