<i>        &gt;&gt;Isn't Bell's inequality derived correctly from QM as we know it?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Omega  omega@pacific.net :        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Yes, a totally correct result of orthodox theory. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
If Bell's inequality was derived from Quantum Mechanics then modern Physics <br>
would be in big trouble because Bell's Inequality is wrong.<br>
<p>
Many people including Einstein and Bell himself were unhappy that Quantum <br>
Mechanics could not make exact predictions, only statistical ones. They were <br>
even more unhappy about what Einstein contemptuously called "spooky action at <br>
a distance". They thought that these deficiencies were just caucused by our <br>
lack of information, hidden variables, and of course they though these  <br>
variables were local.   <br>
<p>
So what's the difference between local and non local?  <br>
1) A local force changes with distance and usually diminishes, a non local    <br>
   force has the same strength at one nanometer as it has at 10 billion light    <br>
   years.  <br>
2) A local force acts by the exchange of particles, so if A changes B locally    <br>
   then A must touch B or touch something that does touch B; a non local    <br>
   force jumps directly from A to B without doing anything in-between and so    <br>
   you can't stop it or change it in any way by doing things in the <br>
   intervening space.  <br>
3) Most important of all, a local force originating at point A can not change    <br>
   anything at point B in less time than it takes for light to travel from    <br>
   A to B, a non local force acts instantly.<br>
<p>
Bell's genius was in asking exactly the right question, "Assuming that there  <br>
is such a thing as objective reality, is there anything every conceivable  <br>
local hidden value theory would have in common?". The answer is yes, Bell <br>
found that even if we are ignorant of important variables, as long as the <br>
world was local, an inequality he found about the correlation of polarized <br>
photons was always true. Bell also found that Quantum Mechanics predicted <br>
that his equality was always false.<br>
<p>
If took over 20 years for somebody to convincingly perform the very difficult  <br>
experiment that Bell suggested, but when they did, Bell's inequality was  <br>
violated. This does not prove that Quantum Mechanics is the last word on the  <br>
subject, but it does prove that all local hidden variable theories are wrong.<br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;Steve:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Aren't there some experiments (one by Aspick? (sp?)) that pretty        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;convincingly demonstrate the inequality?</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;Omega:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;The name is "Aspect", and I believe some others have worked on this        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;too, although I don't have any other names.  My impression is that        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;his work is fairly well accepted.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
The first one to test Bell's inequality was John Clauser in 1972. Clauser was <br>
convinced that the world was local and thought his experiment would prove it; <br>
he was disappointed when it pointed in the opposite direction.  Clauser's <br>
experimental method did contain some very small logical loopholes, and those<br>
who were desperate to have a local universe clung to them. Years later when <br>
Aspect did the experiment he was much more rigorous and the loopholes were <br>
closed. If there is an objective reality then a local Universe is dead.<br>
