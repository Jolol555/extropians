<i>&gt;*FIRST DESIGN: The first poster image will be a remake of my father's award</i><br>
<i>&gt;winning commercial photo of Cat Woman (Julie Newmar) of  "Batman."  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;image depicted her standing in a shinny gold swim suit on the beach with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;harpoon.  (Other models who posed for him were Raquel Welch, Sharon Tate and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jill St. John. )  The transhuman rendition of my father's image will be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Transhuman Woman in silicon skin.  The beach will be another environ, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;harpoon might be a different wepon, perhaps something with which to compat</i><br>
<i>&gt;death with.</i><br>
<p>
I realize that to many of you, extropian ideals are philosophical. Well,<br>
fair enough, but I consider myself a scientist, and I feel that there's no<br>
room for pretention in science. First of all, the idea of a human or<br>
posthuman or transhuman or anyotherprefixhuman with silicon skin isn't even<br>
a concept out of science fiction, it's a concept out of stupid people trying<br>
to be trendy. The crystals of pure silicon (Si) used as semiconductor chips<br>
are used for the semiconductor properties of silicon. In addition, silicon's<br>
crystaline lattice structure is very rigid (another reason it's used for<br>
chips .. I don't think that "flaccid state components" would be a very good<br>
marketing selling point), so that if someone did, in fact, have silicon<br>
skin, they wouldn't be very mobile. So if a physicist did in fact develop<br>
silicon skin, they would be considered the next Steven Hawking. Although,<br>
not so much a brilliant physicist as an immobile one. A much better choice<br>
for the skin of this transhuman woman would be a carbon (C) compound, since<br>
so much of nanotechnology depends on organic chemistry, biochemistry, and<br>
molecular biology. HEY! wait a minute! Our skin *IS* made of carbon .. How<br>
do you like that? The future is here today. <br>
Drop the pretension, honey, it makes us all look like idiots. If I wanted<br>
future fantastic with no basis in science, I'd read Mondo 2000 (and I do).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Note:  these images will in no way be gender biased.  In fact, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;pre-production are men, and other genders.)</i><br>
<p>
I think that the images are kingdom biased! What about plants? eh?<br>
Paramecium have a right to exist!! Don't they? .. speciesist ...<br>
