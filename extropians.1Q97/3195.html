I have made no assumptions about why you are rich.  I only noted that<br>
you are relatively rich.  I said nothing about pretending anything,<br>
nor do I think friends whose values differ are any less "true"<br>
friends.<br>
<p>
This thread started when I lamented the fact that very few people I've<br>
ever met identify themselves with their ideas as strongly as I do.  To<br>
which you responded:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why do you care about the opinions of those who can't see beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;externalities--they're not worth wasting a short life on.</i><br>
<p>
You would clearly be a very unhappy person had you not found friends<br>
who share your values as closely as you think your friends do.  But<br>
don't begrudge those of us with very ususual values the benefits of a<br>
diversity of associatations gained from a tolerance of different values.<br>
