<i>&gt; &gt;   For the record, I consider transhumanism desirable, libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; undesirable, and see no connection between them.  (And out of respect</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for list convention, I do not seek to open debate on the second</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clause.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I fail to see how avoiding political debate or discussion is respectful</i><br>
<i>&gt; to this listserv. [...]</i><br>
<p>
  The Squirrel acknowledges the case made for debating the subjects<br>
mentioned; notwithstanding, if memory serves, such discussions often<br>
rapidly deteriorate into libertarian/antilibertarian flame wars, of<br>
which many list members bore easily; hence the convention mentioned.<br>
And although the Squirrel enjoys throwing nuts and chattering at<br>
people as only a member of his tribe can; nevertheless, he, too, bores<br>
easily, so will save his ammunition for more interesting targets.<br>
<p>
  The Squirrel made his "for the record" posting only to save other<br>
list members from the egregious and embarrassing error of mistaking<br>
him for a libertarian.  Ew.    8:)   &lt;-- (smiling Squirrel face)<br>
