<i>&gt; &gt; Please explain what you mean here, because my mind has no referent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for the word "economics" that comes anywhere close to the attributes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you assign to it here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Avarice &gt; self-interest &gt; Economics</i><br>
<p>
I ask for a definition, and you just name three things that have<br>
nothing to do with each other?  Is your mind so full of floating<br>
abstractions and propaganda that you can't define terms clearly?<br>
<p>
"Avarice" is clearly a superset of self-interest: it implies naive<br>
short-term value of self at the expense of others.  It is irrational<br>
because it comes at the long-term expense of oneself as well.  An<br>
avaricious predator can only exploit others, while a rationally<br>
self-interested actor can benefit from mutual cooperation with others.<br>
<p>
"Self-interest" is simple enough, though you seem to attach some<br>
negative connotation to it.  How can value life if you do not value<br>
your own?<br>
<p>
"Economics" I have already defined for you, since you seem unclear<br>
on the concept.  What was it about my definition you didn't like?<br>
Do you deny that need and scarcity exist?  Do you deny that those<br>
facts imply the principles that follow from them?  Do you disagree<br>
that studying those principles is rational?<br>
<p>
The remainder of your message seems to attack capitalism, because<br>
you seem to equate it with avarice (and conformity, wherever that<br>
one sneaked in).  I suggest that you clarify your usage of terms<br>
in your own mind, and you might find your arguments more compelling.<br>
As they are, they seems as meaningless and disconnected as a Ross<br>
Perot advertisement.<br>
