From: Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; [Elizer is quoting Anders Sandberg without attribution:]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hmm, I'm not so convinced about this. Remember Piaget's various stages,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; where the child seems to lack certain abilities before certain ages, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gradually develop concepts such as object constancy (things exist when I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not looking at them) or conservation (if I move things around but do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; take anything away, then there is the same amount of stuff). Most likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; these have to be reinforced by experience, and may be completely due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the environment (at least the later). The way to test it is of course to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bring up a child in a virtual reality with different laws... </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What a concept.  WHAT a concept.  Alert Greg Egan.  "Bring up a child in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a virtual reality with different laws!"  Do you really think that if one</i><br>
<i>&gt; plus one always equalled three in the virtual environment, the child</i><br>
<i>&gt; would begin thinking in new laws of mathematics that were based on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; basic assumption?  Wouldn't he notice that in his own mind, one thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; and one thought equalled two thoughts?</i><br>
<p>
This raises the question of which concepts are contingent and might be<br>
different in a different reality, and which are fixed.  Does it really<br>
make sense to create a VR where 1+1=3?  What would that mean?  Would it<br>
be enough for the VR, whenever two identical objects came close together,<br>
to create a third identical object?  Or what about two different objects?<br>
It creates a third of some kind?  Does this really suffice?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What a concept.  I'm reminded of the time that, teaching the Pythagorean</i><br>
<i>&gt; theorem to someone, they asked:  "What if c equalled a times b instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; the square root of a squared plus b squared?"</i><br>
<p>
Similarly, how would this be done in a VR?  I don't see how you could<br>
even display a geometry where this worked.  The units aren't right,<br>
hypoteneuses would scale differently than sides.  It seems incoherent.<br>
Making one where c = a+b might be more plausible, but even then I'm not<br>
sure you could derive a consistent geometry and display it.<br>
<p>
A more interesting idea would be to have a 4D VR.  Of course the visual<br>
field would still be 2D, but it could be a projection of 4D objects.<br>
Maybe everything would have some degree of transparency, but that might<br>
not be necessary.  Somehow the person in the VR would have to be able to<br>
move his limbs four dimensionally.  I recall reading about a 19th century<br>
mathemetician who spent a lot of time building models of four dimensional<br>
objects out of blocks, and who later claimed to be able to visualize them<br>
directly in four dimensions.  This could be a short cut way to achive this<br>
skill.<br>
