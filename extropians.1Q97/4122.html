Speak for yourself... the vast majority of the human race probably fit<br>
into that category (talking and imagining rather than doing), but the<br>
extropians I've met don't seem to. This may be because I tend to meet<br>
those who have done things which make them stand out on the Net. <br>

Well, OK, I do like rally-driving, scuba-diving, jetboats and ultralights<br>
and think that helicopters are totally cool, particularly when they're<br>
leaning over on their side. But that's because I'm not entirely sure that<br>
life-extension will be possible and I don't want to discover that in fifty<br>
years time and realise that I'd missed out on a lot of fun for nothing. <br>

Hmm, I wrote a PGP-aware email program for Sun/Linux/FreeBSD, which is<br>
used by a lot of people around the world for secure, private email. Some<br>
of my code was or is in the Mixmaster remailer, and I co-ran a remailer<br>
for some time. I was also involved in the Digicash ecash trials a couple<br>
of years ago. Other extropians have written code for PGP and released<br>
secure Web servers and proxies. There seems to be a large overlap between<br>
the active extropians and active cypherpunks. <br>
<p>
Of course from my point of view this was a totally selfish pursuit, as in<br>
order to protect my privacy I have to work to protect privacy in general.<br>
So what looks like altruism to one may be selfish to another. <br>
