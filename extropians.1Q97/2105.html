Hi.  I'm about 90 days backlogged in reading the list but I had a thought<br>
you might like.  (I feel like that character who only communicated by<br>
(virtual) teletype in the dungeons-and-dragons world of Vinge's _True<br>
Names_.  The UPS guys would deliver this teletype to the Castle...<br>
was it THE POSTMAN?)<br>
<p>
I like to wonder how AI might arise from software development efforts<br>
going on right now.  Also, I wonder how we might give AIs the qualities<br>
we want them to have.<br>
<p>
Maybe AIs will come about as assemblies of pieces of software that all<br>
do sensible jobs that we understand: indexing, modeling, taking statistics<br>
and making predictions, parsing and composing sentences, keeping schedules,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
Maybe the personalities of these AIs will have a lot to do with the<br>
personalities of the components.  You know what I mean.  Every piece of<br>
software has some sort of personality.  We notice whether<br>
software is easy or hard, fun or boring, straightforward or devious,<br>
dependable or flakey or downright infuriating...<br>
<p>
If the personality of AI is going to flow from the personalities of its<br>
components, that's scary, because a lot of software these days is nasty<br>
and badly behaved.  I spend a lot of time trying to deal with software that<br>
seems to be written by people who have no respect for me, my time, my<br>
sanity, my need to understand, or my peace of mind.  People who seem not<br>
to take responsibility for the context in which their software is going<br>
to be used.  These attitudes seem implicit in the behavior of software.<br>
For instance, I install a new version of my OS and the TCP settings are<br>
toast, and the new control panel doesn't make sense.  Or it fails with a<br>
completely uninformative and patently absurd message, with no clue where<br>
to go from there. I call up the help wizzard and it says, "Put your<br>
DNS server address here," indicating a section of a form that has no<br>
blanks to fill in.  (This is Mac System 7.5.5's Guide on the TCP/IP<br>
control panel.  A really beautiful animation of drawing a red crayon<br>
circle in an empty white space, including showing through the translucent<br>
help box.)<br>
<p>
I'm not so much complaining about the present as fearing for the future:<br>
imagine an AI with all the worst personality flaws of the latest<br>
releases from your favorite software companies.  Larry Ellison and<br>
Bill Gates on chips, or downloading intently into your WebTV.  You get home<br>
and you your house has been upgraded with a butler that's like Word 6.<br>
