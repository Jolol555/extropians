<i>&gt;However, there are often numerous pages, as well as others popping up or</i><br>
<i>&gt;dissapearing every now and again.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly why I want to suggest that microsoft or netscape come out with a<br>
tag to automatically change a searchtool's url pointer to aim at a<br>
different location if that page moved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rather than looking at push as simply slow TV, think of it as customized</i><br>
<i>&gt;TV. Last month I was lamenting that the channels and shows I liked on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the tube were so spread out that it was a pain in the butt to hunt for</i><br>
<i>&gt;them and keep track of what I want to watch when, so much so that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;often miss things I wanted to see, and see nothing interesting when I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have the time available. Push technology is like a smart VCR. I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;love for the cable company to offer the ability for each customer to put</i><br>
<i>&gt;their ten or twenty favorite channels all in the 1-10 or 1-20 slots, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;you dont have to go skipping through the channel spectrum. This is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;need that is becoming more prevalent as more and more channels are added</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the dial.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly what push technology is also. Imagine content SO FUCKING ADDICTIVE<br>
you just want to sit infront of the computer/tv combo box 24 hours a day<br>
because it's throwing all the information you CRAVE constantly at you. All<br>
this information streaming in is aimed directly at your id. Of course this<br>
content will come along with a advertisement or two aimed directly at your<br>
id and you'll have to learn incredible will power to resist the urge to buy<br>
"exactly what you were looking for".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rather than lament this sign of media convergence, we need to recognise</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we are the exceptions, the elites in the new order. Our tastes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not necessarily the same as the masses. THey are much more used to and</i><br>
<i>&gt;demanding of the practice of being led around by the nose ring. They</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically do not want to have to think about that which is not immediate</i><br>
<i>&gt;to them. Recognising this, we can use this trend to our advantage in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;memetic engineering. Seeing Reilly Jones' excellent commentary of Stove</i><br>
<i>&gt;critiques of irrationality in our intellectual and memetic landscapes, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am struck by the idea of using push media to push extropic memes into</i><br>
<i>&gt;the mainstream just as irrationalist thinkers did the same in our higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;educational system.</i><br>
<p>
Push technology is precisely the opposite while it may appear as that at<br>
first. Through intelligent agents and collective intelligence, two mindsets<br>
of the same type will begin to diverge to become more individualistic. Push<br>
technology gives you more of what you like when you like and subtle<br>
differences will begin to form which will cause the gap to widen between<br>
individuals just as potholes in a road form due to ice expanding. All<br>
content providers on the net providing webpages and the like will suddenly<br>
be able to find their audiences though push technology and the suggestions<br>
collective intelligence technologies will make based on their personal<br>
profiles. The media companies may think they're winning the war on the net<br>
and that media centralism will continue but they're dead wrong, it's<br>
exactly the opposite. Alot of people on this mailinglist and beyond think<br>
the same as us. We will be matched up with their profiles and we will even<br>
be able to compare who is like whom. Through push technology we will also<br>
be able to 'find' all the would-be extropians out there all over the planet<br>
that haven't heard of us and will enable all of us to unite to form a power<br>
of sorts to combat entropy worldwide. (It may sound a little unbelievable<br>
but so is nanotech).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;While it seems paradoxical to propose using entropic methods or media</i><br>
<i>&gt;techniques to spread extropic meme's, we need to recognise that methods</i><br>
<i>&gt;and techniques are not the message, nor are they themselves entropic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;merely that they have been used by entropic forces up to this point in</i><br>
<i>&gt;time. We need to realize that the masses will always demand watered down</i><br>
<i>&gt;versions of "the truth", they can't take 200 proof TRUTH without</i><br>
<i>&gt;overdosing and having an allergic reaction. Diluted doses of any foreign</i><br>
<i>&gt;agent builds up a tolerance over time.</i><br>
<p>
Wrong. This is the technology that will CAUSE individuality to rise faster<br>
than it has ever before. You've already seen how the web can cause people<br>
to find new interests by accidently clicking on links and even creating<br>
ideas caused by that accidental clicking and causing two totally off the<br>
wall ideas to converge. This is the perfect environment for breakthroughs.<br>
The accidental clicking or even innacuracy of search tools may cause people<br>
to notice a bit of interesting information they never realized before and<br>
cause them to research it further and develop a new interest. Notice how<br>
people can wander off topic when doing a search with a searchtool? You need<br>
to go from point A to point B to find point C way off in another area. It<br>
only gets better from here on out.<br>
