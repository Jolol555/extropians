<i>&gt;You can try to define this aspect of life away, but you will not change the</i><br>

<p>
Reilly, this view of the world is not wholly true, but only partially<br>
true.  Co-operation is also a strong theme in nature.  Or did you miss<br>
that part of Biology 101 because it didn't suit you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again, I see here a utopian dream to revoke evolutionary laws. </i><br>
<p>
Try actually reading what people are saying instead of jumping to<br>
conclusions.  You are reading Gregory through some sort of half-assed<br>
Objectivist, pseudo-realist filter.  What the hell is wrong with<br>
utopianism, so long as it isn't trying to capture the force of law?<br>
Aren't we allowed to try and make things better in your view of the world?<br>
 Given your 'realistic' view of things, what would *you* suggest we do<br>
 to lessen violence in society?<br>
<p>
[snip]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suspect this view of evolution is uncomfortable for you.  It is far</i><br>
<i>&gt;easier to indulge in psycho-babble to divert attention from how things</i><br>
<i>&gt;really work.</i><br>
<p>
You fail to distinguish between how things really work and how *you*<br>
think they really work.  You are betraying the very concept of truth you<br>
suppose you uphold.  Yes, there is a lot of violence in nature; but co-<br>
operation is also a possibility.  Nature wasn't made to satisfy Gregory's<br>
whims, for sure: neither was it made to satisfy yours.<br>

<i>&gt;&lt;...that person may not be able to keep that resolution do to the force of</i><br>
<i>&gt;underlying, unquestioned, subconscious emotions.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Modern neuroscience, particularly in the nineties, has pretty much done</i><br>
<i>&gt;away with the last disreputable vestiges of this Freudian propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
Ehh?  Pardon me?  How *could* neuroscience do that anyway?  Certainly<br>
nobody believes Freud's whole story anymore, but no psychologist would<br>
deny the concept of the subconscious in *some* functional sense.  What<br>
about MacLean's 'Triune Brain' theory?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;If we ignore [emotions] then they control us without our being aware of</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. Deny it and you remain naive and determined.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our emotions don't make us robots, they make us human.  Your distaste for</i><br>
<i>&gt;truth again shows itself by inverting reality.  Trust your emotions, give</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself a break.  Just because people have claimed that eating Twinkies</i><br>
<i>&gt;caused them to commit heinous criminal acts doesn't mean they can escape</i><br>
<i>&gt;responsibility for their actions.</i><br>
<p>
Gregory hasn't said anything anywhere about lack of emotional control excusing<br>
responsibility. You are reading through your filters again.  Try to be<br>
more objective.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
[snip]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;People have violent urges when they feel insecure.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are a lot of elderly individuals who feel insecure in their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;neighborhoods because of the roving barbaric thugs, steeped in relativism</i><br>
<i>&gt;and chock full of self-esteem, outside their doors.  Do the insecure</i><br>
<i>&gt;elderly in this situation have violent urges?  Is it these raging grannies</i><br>
<i>&gt;we need to slip an emotive education to?</i><br>
<p>
Come off it, this is not what he's talking about at all.  Barbaric thugs<br>
chock full of self-esteem?  Precisely the opposite is true, in *most*<br>
cases. Go back and read your Rand again and try and learn something from<br>
her instead of just picking up her prejudices.<br>
<p>
<p>
[snip]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do you mean like "Love your neighbor" and "Turn the other cheek"?  How</i><br>
<i>&gt;novel.</i><br>
<p>
Does something have to be novel to be true?  The fact of the matter, as<br>
I see it, is that you are quite correct to say that we should always<br>
have in reserve the most powerful weapons we can make.  But Gregory is<br>
correct in what he is saying about emotional training, and that it's a<br>
far better strategy when you are dealing with intelligent creatures to<br>
take on the responsibility of cutting of the negative feedback<br>
retaliation loop than to just dumbly let it keep going, eating up<br>
resources.  Speak softly and carry a big stick, no?<br>
