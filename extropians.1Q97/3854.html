<i>&gt; Now who is assigning motivations to whom? In a world where contracts</i><br>
<i>&gt; between individuals are virtually unenforceable without corporations or</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians in your pocket (not too different from a pre-capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; arisotcracy, eh?), what is to be done? We have free trade and open</i><br>
<i>&gt; travel between our nation which does a pretty good job of protecting the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fruit of one's labor, and nations like China etc, who share your ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; that individual have no right to protection of their ideas. China is</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardly the sort of anarchists paradise I would think you dream of.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While I am trying to make proposals to work within an existing system to</i><br>
<i>&gt; maximize human liberty, you are sniping me from an irrational idealistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; position that has frankly a snowballs chance of ever becoming real. </i><br>
<p>
If you honestly believe that a valid contract between two people<br>
canot be enforced with either private arbitration or public courts,<br>
then we indeed can argue no further.  I simply don't beieve that,<br>
and if I did, I would spend /all/ my efforts changing it, because<br>
I refuse to give up on civilization.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Property" is a human right by virtue of the objective nature of it:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that a piece of property cannot simultaneously serve the ends of two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; different people.  If you want to expand that to include things that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; /can/ simultaneously be used by everyone, then give me a /reason/, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just your feeling that it is "natural".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That an intagible property like a book, program, DNA sequence, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention can be reproduced and distributed makes your argument void, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; two copies of a property can obviously serve the ends of two people at</i><br>
<i>&gt; once. </i><br>
<p>
Yes!  That's exactly my point, but it doesn't invalidate /my/ argument,<br>
it topples yours.  A book, a program, and a DNA sequence ARE NOT<br>
PROPERTY, because property is, by definition, that which two people<br>
cannot simultaneously own.  Your continued insistence to call them<br>
property is just a failure to see that that's precisely what we are<br>
arguing about.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; That we humans are intelligent, and can create new knowledge sets us</i><br>
<i>&gt; apart and justifies our concept that we are more than just animals,...</i><br>
<i>&gt; If we are to maintain</i><br>
<i>&gt; that all power is derived from the individual (as Jefferson, et al,</i><br>
<i>&gt; stipulated), and not as a consequence of one person having a bigger gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; (as Mao stipulated), we must ask, what is it about a person that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; different from an average animal?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I am unimpressed by any claims that human cognition is of<br>
any significantly different character than animal cognition, rather<br>
than simply a matter of degree.  Such arguments are usually made by<br>
mystics who want to think we have some special place in the world,<br>
rather than just being yet another clump of cells in the soup of life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I claim no supernatural or other external source of these rights, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that these concepts are, in the big scheme of things, merely</i><br>
<i>&gt; created fictions, the fact that we concieved them, and can observe them</i><br>
<i>&gt; in practice is demonstration enough of our uniqueness, and of the source</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the power of the individual. What is it that makes each of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals? partly, it is our DNA, and partly, it is the ideas,</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoughts, dreams, and experiences we as individuals go through on our</i><br>
<i>&gt; own unique paths through life. because of this, these two things that</i><br>
<i>&gt; make us individuals deserve and demand our full protection.</i><br>
<p>
Even Jefferson, who you seem to esteem, utterly rejected the idea that<br>
knowledge itself could be "property", and this is in fact still the<br>
law, affirmed in Feist v. Rural, though even this is in danger from<br>
recently proposed treaties.  Even the DNA you claim as the most natural<br>
of properties has already been litigated, and found NOT to be property.<br>
I agree that creation is a wonderful thing, but the value of creation<br>
itself is more than sufficient to ensure its rewards.  When you combine<br>
it with force, you devalue it.<br>
