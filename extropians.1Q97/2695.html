I'm not sure what you mean by "debunked".  Coase has certainly not<br>
proved that torts do better than legislatures at dealing with<br>
externalities and public goods/bads. <br>

Given that we had a slave trade, it would indeed make sense to argue<br>
about how to make it more efficient.  And since we do in fact have<br>
legislatures, it makes sense to argue about how to make them better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The use of force to rule others is evil, period.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;strong burden of proof is on those who would rule us to prove that</i><br>
<i>&gt;/any/ involuntary government is necessary before it makes sense to</i><br>
<i>&gt;argue its form. </i><br>
<p>
"Burden of proof"?  "necessary"?  There are governments now.  If you<br>
want to convince people to work to get rid of them, you have to<br>
convince people they would like their circumstances substantially<br>
better without a government.  Baldface claims that govts are<br>
"evil" are not going to get you very far toward this goal.<br>
