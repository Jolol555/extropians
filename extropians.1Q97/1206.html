From: Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; They say women are discouraged from studying mathematics.  Well, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sorry.  No doubt, the poor dears are discouraged.  When I see them </i><br>
<i>&gt; eating one meal a day and spitting blood, then I'll know they are </i><br>
<i>&gt; serious.  </i><br>
<p>
Consider another possibility: not that women lack mathematical talent,<br>
the intelligence needed to be considered geniuses, but rather that they<br>
prefer to devote their attentions to more worldly concerns: family,<br>
relationships, life.<br>
<p>
Lyle's story about the sacrifices and dedication necessary (in at least<br>
some cases) to become a first rate mathematician emphasizes the importance<br>
of other factors than intelligence.  I think we can see this in other<br>
areas as well.  In my experience, women are on the average less interested<br>
in some of the speculative technological areas that we discuss here, like<br>
the singularity, nanotech, posthumanism, etc.  Many women consider these<br>
topics as excessively abstract and cold, not directly related to the<br>
realities of life.<br>
<p>
I don't have any basis to make claims regarding whether these differences<br>
are cultural or biological!  And naturally there are exceptions among<br>
both sexes.  But what I observe is not that women are less intelligent,<br>
but that they have different interests and a different focus on what<br>
is important.<br>
