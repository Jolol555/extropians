<i>&gt; Here's just one snippet from one of the web sites Sean points us to:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        Dr. Patrick Dixon, author of “The Genetic Revolution,” said the</i><br>
<i>&gt; advance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  had “horrendous” implications. ‘What is its value if it comes with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  enormous risk of some nut trying to clone himself?’</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; — DR. RICHARD NICHOLSON</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Editor, "Bulletin of Medical Ethics"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        “We will probably be able to recover the dead from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their bodies before they die. In this way, parents could</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;‘reproduce’ a carbon copy of a child who tragically died,”</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;he told The Sunday Telegraph. “This is something that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;needs to be regulated and outlawed.”</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        Dr. Richard Nicholson, editor of the “Bulletin of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Medical Ethics,” told The Sunday Telegraph he was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;surprised the government had sanctioned the experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        “It was a nice technical problem, but what is its value</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;if it comes with the enormous risk of some nut trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;clone himself?” he asked.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Clearly, this will precipitate a firestorm of discussion and a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; reactions like those quoted above.  I suggest we focus very closely on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public reaction and use the List here to share any information about</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing attempts to outlaw this technology.  Assuming this result is</i><br>
<i>&gt; verified, it obviously has tremendous potential.  I'm almost sorry it</i><br>
<i>&gt; happened before our ideas have had more time to take root and serve as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; memetic inocculation against this sort of knee-jerk response. . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Don't worry, abortion was considered a horrendous and immoral idea for a<br>
long time, but is now legal in almost every nation. Those that outlaw<br>
cloning will simply create a market for high priced cloning in legal<br>
jurisdictions. You'd think that people would learn from history.<br>
Personally, I'd love to have  few more of me around to talk to.<br>
Outlawing it will actually strengthen our hand, as we can get publicity<br>
by filing lawsuits against restrictive governments, asylum in freindly<br>
nations, and gain recongnition by Amnesty International as an opressed<br>
political group.<br>
<p>
Here's an interesting way to use cloning to discredit anti-abortionists:<br>
if they are for life, they must be for cloning. Getting support from<br>
womens groups would be a plus here.<br>
<p>
This makes me want to go to medical school just to learn how to clone,<br>
so I can start up a cloning clinic for fun and profit.....<br>
