Michael Bowling said, "I say self awareness in any being presupposes and <br>
necessitates legal rights and protection.".<br>
<p>
What do you mean by "self awareness"?  What are your criteria for "self <br>
awareness"?  Is a dog self aware?  Why or why not?  Are plants self aware?  <br>
Why or why not?  As you're thinking about this, are you deliberately arranging <br>
the definition of "self awareness" so that it applies only to humans?  <br>
<p>
One could argue that a plant is self aware, because it adjusts its internal <br>
functioning according to it's needs, so the plant is aware of itself (it's <br>
needs) to some extent.<br>
<p>
Does "awareness" mean 'responding to stimulii'?  If so, then "self awareness" <br>
would seem to mean 'responding to self generated stimulii'.  This definition <br>
of "self-awareness" would cover many, many types of organisms.  Should these <br>
organisms receive legal protection?<br>
<p>
Why should legal protection be based on how *conscious* a system is?  Why not <br>
on how beautiful a system is or on how much it weighs or some other property? <br>
(Typically, it's based on how similar the system is to those granting legal <br>
protection.) If a conscious or even sentient system is unable to defend itself <br>
from injury or destruction, do other conscious systems have an *obligation* to <br>
protect it if they are able to?  Why or why not?<br>
<p>
These issues are important to think about.  Providing legal protection can be <br>
very costly, and we should carefully consider our stand on when it should or <br>
should not be provided.  Do we prosecute someone for killing a tree because we <br>
believe the tree was "self aware" and deserved our protection?  How about an <br>
animal, such as a dog or a cat?  How about a human fetus?  How about an infant <br>
or a child?  Or an adult human?  How about a very advanced AI?<br>
