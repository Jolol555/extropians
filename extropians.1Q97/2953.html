Hello everyone,<br>
<p>
2 million British children suffer from the effects of malnutrition. A <br>
British study ("The Hunger within") shows that this is mainly a <br>
consequence of the cancellation of state subvention. This is another <br>
step to a more and more liberated economy (less state intervention) -- <br>
and those children, yeah, at least now they can freely decide if they <br>
want to eat or not! The only thing that surprises me is that so many <br>
decide not to eat. Stupid children.<br>
<p>
Next step: Children should get the right to freely decide whether they <br>
want to quit school and to work in the heavy industry! Best starting age <br>
is probably at the age of 9 or 10, when they're young and ready to <br>
learn. Yeah, British economy, they know how to do it -- one of the <br>
highest economic growth rates in Europe! <br>
<p>
And we can solve the problem with those poor families, too -- we simply <br>
strike out public welfare, and the problem solves itself! And anyone who <br>
dies from hunger or gets ill or both is of course guilty himself! Had he <br>
done as much as he could -- he would have survived. Wouldn't he? <br>
<p>
To those of you who haven't already noticed: Yeah, I'm a cynic.<br>
<p>
Erik<br>
