<i>                &gt;Ho, ho, ho!  Scientists discover that neurons can influence                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;each other in yet another completely unexpected fashion.                  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Does this make them less complicated?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The article was about information stored in the synapse not the neuron. <br>
It doesn't make the synapse less complicated and it CERTAINLY doesn't make <br>
them more complicated, it DOES mean that the effective number of synapses you <br>
need to worry about is MUCH less.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Ho, ho, ho!  My right foot it does.  Just because a LTP                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;change releases nitrous oxide that causes another LTP change                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;doesn't change the amount of information stored by one                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;neuron</i><br>
<p>
<p>
But the article proves that there are lots of synapses that have the same <br>
information.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;To put it another way, instead of each neuron storing                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;500 bits of information, a  configuration of 500 neurons                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;holds 500 pieces of 500-bit data, one bit from each piece of                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;data in each neuron.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That will not work, change one value and lots of others will change too, if  <br>
I am forced to write into 500 notebooks at the same time then, they will not <br>
hold more information than one notebook if it could be used by itself.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;To put this all in perspective, imagine this: "Scientists                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;have discovered that when a neuron  fires, it releases               </i><br>
<i>                &gt;chemicals that cause other  neurons nearby to fire."</i><br>
<p>
<p>
LTP is not about neurons firing but about the long term strength of  <br>
connections. If you change the LTP of one neuron lots of others will change  <br>
too so they can't be an independent place to store information.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Does this reduce the computational complexity of the brain?                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Very definitely. If the article had said that they also found that each  <br>
synapse held 1000 times as much information as previously thought then the  <br>
information storage capacity of the brain would be unchanged. The article  <br>
said not one word about that.<br>
