<i>&gt;</i><br>
No disagreement here, really.  The time period that I was referring to <br>
starts pre-cambrian.  Human history is only a tiny part of it. <br>
Human genes are greatly the result of the evolution of pre-human critters.<br>
The vast majority of that time there was no wealth, unless clams got money.<br>
<p>
The point that I was trying to make was that, if we treat DNA as a<br>
language, there are no words in the human genome for 'rich', and<br>
probably insufficient syntax to talk about riches.<br>
<p>
Please consider a parallel example.  If I observe the following evolution:<br>
  ? -&gt; B -&gt; BCPL -&gt; C -&gt; C++ , I can conclude that C++ probably has a<br>
grammar fit for talking to computers, and is not fit for writing love<br>
poems or dicussing aesthetics.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; And yes, anything that affects behavior can be "encoded in DNA". </i><br>
<i>&gt; { snip articulate supporting arguments - none of which I disagree with }</i><br>
<p>
True, but not sufficient.  Yes, behaviors can be encoded.  However wealth<br>
is not a behavioral concept.  It is a social construction, and there is<br>
no definite connection between behavior and wealth.  Wealth-recognizing<br>
or wealth-producing behavior in one society doesn't always work in another.<br>
( Howard Stern's behavior makes him wealthy in this society, it would<br>
get him shot in mainland China. )  <br>
<p>
The very fact that the correlation between wealth and family size is <br>
cross-cultural is therefore proof that it isn't genetic.  QED.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would tend to suspect other social causes for the effect...</i><br>
Me too.<br>
