<i>                &gt;Sounds a lot like Raymond Smullyan's "The Tao Is Silent".                                </i><br>

<p>
There is no doubt that Smullyan is a mystic and I don't agree with everything   <br>
in "The Tao Is Silent" but it is an absolutely wonderful and brilliant book.   <br>
Before I read Smullyan I thought that all mystics were fools, now I know that <br>
is not true, only most of them are. Other first rate books by Smullyan <br>
everybody should read are "5000 BC", "Forever Undecided", "To Mock A <br>
Mockingbird", and two of my favorite titles for books, "What Is The Name Of  <br>
This Book?" and "This Book Needs No Title". It's not often you can find <br>
Philosophy books that have real depth but are full of humor and are such fun <br>
to read. He also wrote a more technical book "Theory Of Formal Systems".<br>
I try to read everything by Smullyan I can get my hands on, except for some <br>
of his books on Chess.                       <br>

Yes,"Flatland" is a remarkable book, especially when you consider that Abbott  <br>
wrote it in 1880. About a hundred years later Dionys Burger wrote a sequel  <br>
called "Sphereland" to popularize some mathematical ideas Abbott didn't   <br>
mention. I think this is a rare case where the sequel is better than the  <br>
original. Your spelling is correct.<br>
