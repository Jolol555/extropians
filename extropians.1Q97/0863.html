A cheetah would have to be within 100 yards of me to catch me? That is crazy.<br>

<p>
You wouldn't need or want to expose yourself in this manner for long periods. <br>
Pop up, see what's going on, then hide back down. <br>

<i>                &gt;when he is too far away to do anything to you. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If he's just a dot on the horizon then it's useless information. If he's close <br>
enough to make you nervous then there is nothing you can do, you just better <br>
hope he doesn't see you, otherwise he'll meet (or meat) you for lunch. <br>

<p>
<i>                &gt;This is how the meerkats work.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Meerkats are not bipedal an so are fast, often faster than the predator. This <br>
never happens with humans because ground sloths are not carnivorous.<br>

<p>
Lucy would have been a very poor hunter. She had no tools, she was slow, she <br>
did not have sharp teeth and her claws were a joke.  <br>
<p>
Nobody knows what Lucy's "society" was like, but in modern hunter-gatherers  <br>
like the !Kung the woman not only take care of the children they also gather  <br>
mongongo nuts, which turns out to be over half of their food supply and is  <br>
much more reliable than the hunting the men do. <br>

<i>                &gt;&gt;there were no spears, or tools of any sort at that time,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;ancestors  like Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) with                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;their tiny, chimp sized brains were too dumb to make them.    </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;The first very primitive tools were made by Homo  Erectus,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;an animal with a much larger brain than Lucy, although much                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;smaller than modern brains. These very early tools do not                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;show up in the fossil record until well over a million                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;&gt;years after bipedalism was fully developed.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Michael:            </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Stone tools did not show up, or haven't been found yet [...]                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;This does not rule out tools made from biodegradable                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;materials. You'd be amazed at how much damage a sharpened      </i><br>
<i>                &gt;bamboo spear can do to an animal, </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
A sharpened bamboo spear would be harder to make than a simple stone tool, <br>
and if you didn't have stone of bone tools to help you, almost impossible to <br>
make. The only reason I can think of for Lucy to work exclusively in wood is <br>
if she wanted to fool future archeologists.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;or a wooden arrow, like that used by montagnard peoples in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;SE asia or the Kalahari Bush people.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
An arrow?! Arrows are High Technology, only a few thousand years old, you  <br>
might as well be talking about a LASER guided bombs. The Kalahari Bush people <br>
are as smart as you or me, but Lucy was not. Lucy was an ancestor of humans, <br>
however Lucy was not a human, we're talking about an animal with the brain of <br>
a chimp.<br>
<p>
Three and a half million years ago Lucy was fully bipedal and had a hand  <br>
almost as good as ours, but she was dumb, her brain ranged from 380 to 450 cc,   <br>
modern humans have a range of 1000 to well over 2000 cc.                     <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;time. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I haven't noticed. Until some recent finds people thought you had to go back <br>
10 or 20 million rears to find a ancestor common to both humans and apes, <br>
now they say 5 or 6.<br>
