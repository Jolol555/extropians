Time limits suggest I better wrap up my conversation with Lee Crocker.<br>
<p>
Initially, I advocated that most people, especially those (such as<br>
extropians) with extreme views, should<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;take the opinions of others seriously as an important source</i><br>
<i>&gt;of information, and only take an extreme position when they think</i><br>
<i>&gt;they have a particularly unique source of info on the subject</i><br>
<p>
Lee responded:<br>
<i>&gt;But why must I let their judgements affect me?  Why must I personally</i><br>
<i>&gt;give in to their intellectual pathology that judges ideas by their</i><br>
<i>&gt;holders rather than by their actual merits?</i><br>
<p>
and later:<br>
<i>&gt;If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are very few of those indeed. </i><br>
<p>
and today:<br>
<i>&gt;Why do you simply refuse to accept the fact that in all periods of</i><br>
<i>&gt;human history, the vast hordes of people--including the best minds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;each generation--were simply wrong about most things?  ...  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I honestly believe that I am more capable of reliable evaluation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence than almost everyone I have ever met or read ... </i><br>
<i>&gt;it is an evaluation I make without reservation.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, if you are confident that most people in history were especially<br>
sloppy thinkers, and if you are one of the rare careful thinkers, then<br>
you shouldn't give other's opinions much weight.  But this can be good<br>
advice for at most very few people.<br>
<p>
Regarding the claim that most people in history were wrong about most<br>
things, the question is what other cognitive strategy would have<br>
enabled them to be wrong less often.  I claim that for the vast<br>
majority of them, ignoring the opinions of their comtemporaries would<br>
have just made things worse.<br>
