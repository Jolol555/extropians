<i>&gt;Could you explain the causal mechanism behind your assertion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;please? A lot of bad political activity gets fed with this</i><br>
<i>&gt;"manipulating people's feeling of scarcity" meme.</i><br>
<p>
First let me state that i'm no economic, i'm at best a historian, with a<br>
small independent business and a wider interest in society, as such i have a<br>
fairly limited knowledge of macro economics. And most of what is written<br>
here is based on 'insight' rather than knowledge.<br>
<p>
The way i see it, 'manipulating people's feeling of scarcity' (maybe i<br>
shouldn't have used the word 'manipulating') is the driving force behind<br>
economic expansion, it stimulates people to find ways to become more<br>
productive in order to fill that 'gap' which is created. I hold a neutral<br>
view towards it. On one hand i see the benefit of it for an expanding<br>
economy, on the other hand, i would like to see quality given more thought,<br>
before infrastructures are created, as well as see more production goods<br>
marketed as consumer goods, like computers for example.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Markets for new products are usually created among early adopters,</i><br>
<i>&gt;usually wealthy people with time on their hands looking for diversion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and then those markets expand rapidly if (and after) the early adopters</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually find some real benefit in using the new product.</i><br>
<p>
IMHO, it expands after the relation between usefullness, price, and how good<br>
the companies and the early users are at 'showing off' the product, has<br>
become ideal. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I haven't read</i><br>
<i>&gt;Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class yet, but I'm wondering whether or</i><br>
<i>&gt;not he shows any awareness of the vital role a leisured and wealthy</i><br>
<i>&gt;subset of society plays in fueling the economics of technological</i><br>
<i>&gt;progress. Hayek certainly does.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't underestimate the influence of a) the companies b) the mass<br>
consumer market. Surely the 'leasure class' has an impact, but usually a<br>
high quality product of a high quality standard gets marketed on them, then<br>
a second similar product, which is much cheaper, and of another, lower<br>
quality standard gets marketed to the mass market. The cheaper product wins<br>
the infrastructure race, and the leasure class is 'doomed' to work with the<br>
highest possible quality, in that LOWER STANDARD. Influence works both ways.<br>
Ofcourse there are also the companies who press their interests. I think<br>
none of these three really sees TECHNOLOGY, or the quality of it, as the<br>
most important.<br>
<p>
See for examples:<br>
Unix/Linux - pc<br>
VCC - VHS<br>
laserdisc - cd<br>
DAT - DCC (failed though) <br>
etc, etc,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(There's also a business end of this in the way of corporations</i><br>
<i>&gt;that have lots of cash on their hands, but I haven't read as many</i><br>
<i>&gt;analyses of that situation as I have of the one outlined above. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspect that the business angle has more to do with active interest</i><br>
<i>&gt;in innovation than interest in "mere" diversion. I put scare quotes</i><br>
<i>&gt;there for good reason.)</i><br>
<p>
In the previous decade companies seemed to work through a 'leisure class',<br>
but it worked out as i described above. This decade companies seem to have<br>
bypassed this leisure class almost completely, by increasingly making<br>
agreements about that infrastructure before marketing a new product, and<br>
when they do, they go directly to the mass markets.<br>
<p>
For the future i foresee and hope, a professional class will be increasingly<br>
fullfilling the role of that leasure class, in the way you described. This<br>
would lead to more production goods, becoming available as consumer goods,<br>
further stimulating economical expansion with goods being marketed that pay<br>
themselves back. <br>
