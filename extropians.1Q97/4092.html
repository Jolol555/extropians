<i>&gt; &gt; CSICOP are themselves about as credible as the above mentioned accused. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are more interested in maintaining their DOGMA (early 20th century scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; understanding) than in finding the truth. They have repeatedly refused to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; publish ANY papers that might suggest there are "psi" phenomona at work. For a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; scathing critique of CSICOP I suggest you read Robert Anton Wilson's "New</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Inquistion".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That particular hatchet-job, which I have indeed read, is just a sloppy</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempt at faulting CSICOP for doing what they were created to do, and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily what Wilson or others think they should do.  CSICOP's mission</i><br>
<i>&gt; is to be skeptical; that's their charter.  They have no interest in being</i><br>
<i>&gt; "balanced" or presenting "suggestive" evidence for psi, because there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than enough support for such ideas elsewhere.  Their mission is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate that every piece of so-called evidence for psi phenomena can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be adequately and more simply explained by chance and trickery.  They do</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite an admirable job of that, and are a good source of info on that.</i><br>
<p>
So they can hardly be described as a balanced or unbiased source, so<br>
they are therefore not scientific.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As far as Puthoff is concerned, he has published several papers regarding ZPF</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and the Casimir effect in "Physics A" - a conservative journal if there ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Casimir effect is a real observation, and demands further research and</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanation.  The early explanations offered by Puthoff and others may very</i><br>
<i>&gt; well turn out to be the right ones--time will tell.  But given that he has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been duped in the past, I feel quite justified in being skeptical of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims now.</i><br>
<p>
You claim he has been duped, so therefore you use this opinion to add<br>
credence to your other scepticism. Talk about non-Bayesian.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Regarding Flieshman and Pons, their only mistake was bad Public Relations. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; verdict is not out yet on cold fusion - there are still too many experiments</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; acheiving anomolous results and excess energy. Every so called critic of cold</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fusion I've heard so far has yet to present solid unrefutable evidence to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contrary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Their mistake was not behaving like scientists at all.  They called press</i><br>
<i>&gt; conferences before getting their work reviewed, and before letting anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; else reproduce their result.  To date, no one has reproduced their result.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no reason to suspect cold fusion isn't possible, and those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; dismiss any such attempt are indeed being hasty.  But possibility doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; equal a repeated experiment.  When someone with some scientific integrity</i><br>
<i>&gt; produces energy that way, and others can reproduce the experiment, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; it stands up to criticism, then I'll be the first in line to buy stock.</i><br>
<p>
There are several groups who are demonstrating sustained operation of<br>
devices using the same principle. That the patent office has prematurely<br>
ordained that cold fusion is impossible and refuses to grant any patent<br>
claiming that phenomena is used by critics to "prove" its fakery. I have<br>
personal knowledge from people at WPI and UW that ran experiments to try<br>
to "replicate" Pons &amp; Fleishmann's experiments that they 1) did not<br>
exactly reproduce the experiments (they used different metals and<br>
solutions hoping to get the same effect differently, so they could make<br>
their own patent claims to the different technique), 2) they did not use<br>
the specified method of purging normal hydrogen gas from within the<br>
metals used as electrodes and replacing it with deuterium, which is<br>
needed to pretreat the electrodes to be usefull in catalysing fusion<br>
within the structure.<br>
<p>
That a Japanese lab has demonstrated a similar device which catalyses<br>
hydrogen and I beleive potassium, rendering calcium as a measurable<br>
excess in the solution shows that this is a phenomenon which is by<br>
definition, nuclear fusion. How exactly it works is still under debate.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some who have heard me before decry the act of judging ideas by their</i><br>
<i>&gt; holders instead of on their merits might well call me on it now.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be right in a sense: I am using the reputation of a man as a short</i><br>
<i>&gt; cut to evaluating his ideas.  I plead guilty, but with some justification.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not exercising /final/ judgment on the ideas by their holders, only</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing their identity to guide what evidence I spend most time on.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; I judged the men themselves on their reactions to earlier evidence, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; vice versa.  Before their cold fusion debacle, I would have given no more</i><br>
<i>&gt; or less weight to the opinions of F&amp;P than to anyone else.  Now I give</i><br>
<i>&gt; less.  If they reform themselves somehow, they might regain my respect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I admire theoreticians who speculate wildly on the limits of the possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I admire experimentalists who verify and falsify their conjectures.  What</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do not admire is men who mistake one for the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I admire people who redefine our perceptions of what the limits of the<br>
impossible are.<br>
