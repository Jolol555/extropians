Me to T0M:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Are you (consciously) developing Minsky's "Jokes and the Cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Unconscious" (which is a development of Freud's ideas on jokes and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"censors")?</i><br>
<p>
T0Morrow@aol.com:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not consciously; perhaps not at all.  I'm vaguely familar with Freud's take</i><br>
<i>&gt;on humor, but do not recall having heard Minsky's.  My slow, intermitent read</i><br>
<i>&gt;of THE SOCIETY OF MIND continues.   Is it in there?</i><br>
<p>
I think so.<br>
<p>
Okay!  Freud noticed jokes often have to do with taboos.  So he said<br>
that humor seems to have to do with censors (his hypothesized thingies<br>
that stop you from thinking in certain directions).<br>
<p>
I don't know how well Freud developed the idea.  Minsky says Freud's the<br>
greatest.  But here's what I know of how the idea ends up after Minsky:<br>
He noticed that some jokes are just about *thinking errors*.  So,<br>
<p>
The joke sneaks you into a situation where you've made a BOOBOO--a<br>
   forbidden or wrong thought, which is recognized.<br>
a PLEASURE--in fact a small SEIZURE of laughter--is triggered to disrupt<br>
   the progress of thought and put your mind on hold.  It freezes the<br>
   error state along with a little history of what led up to it--so that<br>
a new CENSOR can be installed.<br>
   This is an inhibition: in precursor state A, don't think thought<br>
   B (because it led to the booboo).  "Don't go there," as they say.<br>
<p>
Now, your mind is patched not to make quite the same mistake anymore.<br>
<p>
I think Tom's idea is a nice variation and extension.  A joke is a<br>
pattern that gets past the first line of defense and triggers the<br>
creation of new antibodies.  I like this because immunity is a more<br>
familiar and biological process than Minsky's police raid.  Tom's<br>
idea of innoculation is something that isn't as easy to see<br>
in Minsky's picture.<br>
<p>
But Minsky's idea of laughter as a sudden drastic intervention is<br>
strikingly plausible and doesn't have a counterpart (that I can see--<br>
I haven't read Tom's paper) in the immunity metaphor.  It points out<br>
that thoughts are fast, singular events taking place over a whole brain<br>
at once, instead of slow-moving, gradual-working *little* particles<br>
coming in hoards of duplicates like germs or genes or antibodies.<br>
<p>

     You never wanted to listen in school.<br>
     Now your mind won't go where you wanna take it..." --Devo<br>
