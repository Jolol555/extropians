In a message dated 97-03-22 13:28:08 EST, you write:  <br>
  <br>
&lt;&lt;  Ayn Rand was stubborn about not addressing a lot of issues, blythely  <br>
 dismissing people with hand waving judgementalizing (perhaps accurate, but  <br>
 not always), and it earned her some disdain in intellectual circles. &gt;&gt;  <br>
  <br>
I don't mind convincing the public when some government agency wants to ban<br>
cloning.  But, I see no reason to have to go down to the basics for my<br>
friends who call me stupid for being pro-technology, pro-science,<br>
pro-immortality and stated they will work against me at every turn.  I expect<br>
more from my friends.   <br>
 <br>
The problem is Ayn Rand wanted to argue to change people's minds by<br>
intellectual force and intimidation.  She would not let them alone, got<br>
herself and them mad and burned bridges.  That's too rigid for me.    <br>
  <br>
I'm much more interested in letting friends think what they want.  Seek first<br>
to understand, then and only then be understood.  But if what they think is<br>
too far from what I am working on.  I let them alone and do my own thing.  If<br>
they come closer to me eventually, that's fine.  I might get closer to their<br>
way of thinking too.    <br>
  <br>
But, the post about the very negative friend at lunch was too close to<br>
Seligman, Browne and my Florida friend's situation for me.  A person who is<br>
so totally negative is not close enough in thinking to even discuss as Greg<br>
Burch   ----&lt;GBurch1@aol.com&gt;- suggested doing.  There would be no way to<br>
approach such a person "gradually" as Greg Burch   ----&lt;GBurch1@aol.com&gt;-<br>
suggested,  at least not during _that_ lunch.  Things had gone too far<br>
afield.  Only bridge burning would had been the result that day.  <br>
  <br>
All the better to have a second lunch starting with:  "I thought a lot about<br>
what you said.  I understand why you currently see things that way.  There<br>
are a lot of fears and questions, but I think there are three things you<br>
might want to consider besides."   <br>
 <br>
"First,  more people communicate faster than ever to solve problems, take the<br>
Internet for example. That's extropic.   Second,  science is being discussed<br>
more than ever publicly.  There are few surprises in science, take cloning as<br>
an example.  People have been talking about it since the 1950's.  That's been<br>
in very main stream speculative fiction for years.  And finally,  life<br>
expectancy and health technology is increasing because people are working<br>
hard to make a better quality of life for themselves.  That's what extropy is<br>
for.  What's the alternative?  I can't believe you would want people to work<br>
hard for a _poorer_ standard of living and an increasing death rate, right?"<br>
 <br>
