During communist rule, Russia changed from a local political power<br>
devastated by war, to a technological superpower. How did they do that ?<br>
No... let me guess, they cheated right ? Something DID work for them.<br>
Saying that such a system can only work with no individual freedom<br>
whatsoever, i will agree to, saying its a static system by definition i<br>
cannot. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;transhuman ideas we've talked about originated in socialist countries?</i><br>
<p>
Right, many of them came from constitutional monarchies with social<br>
democrat influences. You seriously think that technology and science are by<br>
definition products of capitalism ? 6.000 years of human history seem to<br>
disagree with you on that. I agree that capitalism has the best influence<br>
on the development of such, but i can't agree with saying all other systems<br>
are static...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How</i><br>
<i>&gt;many will be allowed in such countries? After all, no-one has a right to</i><br>
<i>&gt;immortality until all the homeless have color TVs... </i><br>
<p>
I'm not defending socialism, i'm not attacking capitalism, i am however<br>
advocating a system with a reasonable chance for success. If such a system<br>
is to be anarcho- capitalist, (which is the most interesting option), it<br>
had better include some safeguards, less the homeless will come and take<br>
away my color TV, other than violently suppressing them. (ofcourse i will<br>
be only too glad to give them the cardboard box it came in ;-) ) Such<br>
safeguards would have to include easy social mobility, along the lines of<br>
somewhat equal starting positions.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Whereas these</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; individual characteristics mean little in a politically/socially stable</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; society (!), they tend to flourish in one that is subject to rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; change... ;-) </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exactly. And socialism is all about stability. </i><br>
<p>
Should i get into extreme capitalist demographics ? Imagine a situation<br>
where only the richest 5 % could afford the highest quality education,<br>
imagine a drop in intelligence among that class due to normal genetic<br>
processes, a drop not being filled up for 100% by new people, as all of the<br>
talented nouveau riches had lower educational standards and will never<br>
reach the full 100% of that intelligence level. Same goes for teachers etc.<br>
Now calculate how long it would take for a society like that to become<br>
static... <br>
<p>
It's basically how nobility dissapeared, but ofcourse they had<br>
competition...    <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;I think most people around here would choose libertarianism or</i><br>
<i>&gt;anarcho-capitalism as their ideal political system. Both, of course, allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;people to set up their own voluntary socialist organisations within the</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist structure, but not to force their opinions on the capitalists. </i><br>
<i>&gt;One thing that people seem to miss is that capitalism (or at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian or anarcho-capitalism) is a superset of other kinds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;political organisations, which is why it's preferable to any of them. You</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't have a capitalist community in a communist society, but you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;easily have a voluntary communist community in an capitalist society. </i><br>
<p>
I agree with these ideals, but i'm not so sure some communists who lived in<br>
the US would agree with the practical side of your theory though. I believe<br>
many were taken from their homes and convicted for whatever ideological<br>
crime they had committed, at least twice in US history. Sounds almost as<br>
static to me as some communist policies towards capitalists in their<br>
countries...   <br>
<p>
However, i do wish to express my gratitude to the people of the US<br>
(honestly), for ridding the world of communism. I'm just not going to be<br>
naive about overvalueing the ideological reasons why, if you all are, i'm<br>
really sorry for you. Don't forget the US state is now using the same means<br>
for their socialist indoctrination, they would have used 15-30 years ago<br>
against it... (hint, hint) <br>
<p>
P.S. thanks also for saving the world economy by ensuring that kuwayti oil<br>
keep flowing in the right direction...<br>
<p>
Isn't it about time Europe &amp; Japan start doing something in return for all<br>
these favors ?<br>
