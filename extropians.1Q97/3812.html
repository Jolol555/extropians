On the subject of intellectual property, Jeff Coulter wrote:<br>

<p>
Markets for ideal objects can and do function in the absence of <br>
enforceable <br>
intellectual property rights. <br>
<p>
Functioning markets existed for foreign authors in the U.S. in the 19th <br>
century. The free market paid royalties to British authors even though<br>
those authors <br>
received no copyright protection in the US until the extension of<br>
copyright protection <br>
to foreigners in 1891. The American publishers paid the royalty in order<br>
to obtain <br>
advance galleys, even though they themselves had no legal protection<br>
against competitors <br>
who could legally copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence<br>
of state <br>
protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and<br>
contractual <br>
arrangements for the internalization of externalities.    <br>
<p>
The problem shifts to being one of marketing. Although current<br>
publishers so used to <br>
operating with a copyright may think this analysis strikes at the<br>
foundations of the <br>
publishing biz, it is aimed at the present selling methods.<br>
<p>
American laws over intellectual property are rooted in the English<br>
patents and copyright <br>
system. The Crown issued patents for new inventions with the aim of<br>
securing control of <br>
endeavors thought to be of political import; or to raise money through<br>
the granting of <br>
monopolies. Copyright served to ensure state control over the press in<br>
an era of <br>
tremendous political and religious dissent. As Tom Palmer remarked in<br>
his recent paper <br>
on Intellectual Property, "Monopoly privilege and censorship lie at the<br>
historical root <br>
of patent and copyright." Many times the state granted monopoly<br>
privilege with no <br>
concern for the original inventor. Venice in 1469 (One of the earliest<br>
patents I could <br>
find) granted to John of Spyer a monopoly over the art of printing<br>
itself. Queen Marys' <br>
chartering of the Company of Stationers in 1557, granting its monopoly<br>
over printing, <br>
was an attempt to control a new, threatening technology, primarily to<br>
suppress <br>
Protestantism.     <br>
<p>
Any service or good has, as a component of its' cost of production, not<br>
only the costs <br>
of labor, marketing, capital, etc., but also the cost of exclusion. For<br>
the owner of a <br>
movie theater, these exclusion costs include paying for walls, ticket<br>
windows, ushers. <br>
These serve to exclude or fence out 'freeriders'. Now they could set up<br>
projectors and <br>
show the movies on low level stratus clouds (ok, screens in parks), and<br>
then attempt to <br>
prevent those casually passing by from watching. The method of marketing<br>
their product <br>
is their  choice. In the case where their marketing decision results in<br>
the publicness of a  good,  it seems to me to be grossly unjust to ask<br>
the government to force all who might potentially see the show without<br>
paying to kick in some bucks, whether they DO in fact see the show or<br>
not. Or to force those passing by to don glasses that prevent them <br>
from viewing  the movie. Yet the proponents of property rights in ideas<br>
choose such <br>
a method when they attempt to get every person purchasing a blank tape<br>
to pay a <br>
royalty to a third party. <br>
<p>
Alternatively, as with DAT tape recorders, their proposals seek to ban<br>
or cripple entire <br>
technologies. This method, done in the name of preventing technologies<br>
which are capable <br>
of recording publicized (broadcast) music without loss of fidelity,<br>
would make mere <br>
ownership of tangible property (DAT recorder) a crime. I view proposals<br>
for such an <br>
implementation of property rights in ideas, which wipe out other areas<br>
of property <br>
rights altogether, as inconsistent.<br>
<p>
If we privatize the enforcement of contracts, let those who want to<br>
"own" ideas pay for <br>
the enforcement of that contract.  Market forces will probably lead the<br>
computer <br>
programmer to tie a perceived value to the registration of their program<br>
(cheap <br>
upgrades, technical support, etc.); rather than paying for a protection<br>
agency that <br>
tries to police the digital information realm.  But they would be<br>
welcome to try to <br>
enforce a contract against copying a program that the purchaser would<br>
sign when he buys <br>
the product.  I just wouldn't subscribe to a protection agency that used<br>
some of my <br>
subscription fee to police copyright protection.<br>
