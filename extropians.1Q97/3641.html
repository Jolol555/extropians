<i>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The method is that the take a common cold virus and encode it with 2</i><br>
genes<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that stops the cell (darn another english word i can't remember)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; multiplying/splitting? The virus is used as a carrier for the gene.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting. The question is how to 1) make it target the cancer cells </i><br>
<i>&gt; (the common cold virus doesn't care for (say) glial cells, so the carrier</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; would not look for a glioma),</i><br>
<p>
They use a very simple technique. A syringe directly into the tumor (thats<br>
probably why it has been so effective against known tumors. And why they<br>
are in doubt if they can make it work on cancer that has spread.) They will<br>
start testing in Germany on Humans with cancer in the large intestine colon<br>
that has spread to the liver.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) how to get it to infect all of them </i><br>
<i>&gt; (otherwise the survivors would continue dividing, although the immune </i><br>
<i>&gt; system would now be more likely to look for them if the others were </i><br>
<i>&gt; dying) and </i><br>
<p>
They do that by using several injections in the tumors.<br>
<p>
3) how to avoid making the changed cold virus spread (I'm not <br>
<i>&gt; sure it would be healthy to have such a virus around, mutations happen </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the time). </i><br>
<p>
As far as popular media reports it's two genes that they can change in the<br>
cancer cells. One is to make the cell stop dividing, the other is to make<br>
the cell kill itself if something is wrong with it (like normal cells do i<br>
guess.) They figure that a few normal cells will be killed to. But it's<br>
over such a short timeframe that it shouldn't matter.<br>
<p>
They have found no side effects on the test animals.<br>
