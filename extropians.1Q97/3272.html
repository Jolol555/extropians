<p>
So in order to express and understand things this personal with another<br>
person, we must understand where the other person is coming from ... we<br>
must have an empathy for their framework of perception. And in order to<br>
have such an empathy we must draw from similar personal experiences. And<br>
in order to have similar personal experiences we must have similar<br>
interests and values. And though we could never be absolutely similar to<br>
another person, and we would not want to be, the more we have in common,<br>
the more personal we may be. <br>

<i>&gt; people.</i><br>
<p>
I cannot share with someone, something they cannot recieve. If I were to<br>
meet an alien, an entity who I have relatively little in common with,<br>
our differences will make it nearly impossible for us to communicate.<br>
Our encounter cannot be intimate and personal ... until we make a joint<br>
effort to attune to each other, to by some degree become more like the<br>
other. We must find common ground, and then expand that ground of<br>
similarity until we can communicate freely and personally. I can only<br>
share my thoughts with someone to the degree that they have shared<br>
similar experiences. No matter how much I want to share my thoughts in<br>
space and time with a three month old baby, we will not be able to<br>
communicate deeply until that child has had more experiences similar to<br>
my own. No matter how much I want to share my thoughts with the gingko<br>
tree outside, we will never be able to communicate because we are too<br>
dissimilar. No matter how much I will myself to understand calculus, and<br>
no matter how much a mathmatician wills to communicate it to me, if I<br>
have not first acquired the similar experience of learning algebra and<br>
trigonometry, then such communication is not possible until I have<br>
acquired such experience ... until I have become that much more similar.<br>
<p>
The will to share, and the will to communicate, is the will to conform.<br>
The only people who do not need conform at all, are those who do not<br>
need other people, and thus those who have no need to communicate. I<br>
don't know anyone who fits into that category. As long as we seek<br>
emotive or cognitive interaction with others, we must conform to them<br>
and vice versa. The greater that conformity the greater we can interact.<br>
I personally do not like conforming to others more than I need to, and<br>
its not much of a problem since I do not want to communicate deeply with<br>
very many people. I don't need to communicate deeply with the lady at<br>
Burger King to get my chicken sandwich.<br>
<p>
No one wants to be called a conformist. So we deny the fact that we are<br>
constantly conforming, becoming more similar to each other in order to<br>
interact more deeply and effectively. Extropians offer people reading<br>
lists, suggested reading. This is because Extropians are seeking<br>
potential Extropians, people who can understand and embrace Extropian<br>
ideas. A reading list is a tool to help people conform. They can read<br>
the books and disagree, and never be heard from, they can attempt to<br>
read the books and find them to difficult to read, and never be heard<br>
from, or they can begin reading the books and find that they resonate<br>
with similar thoughts and experiences of their own, and thus they will<br>
seek more reading experiences to increase their ability to interact with<br>
Extropians. There are a list of qualities which make a person Extropian.<br>
We more or less have these qualities in common. If we did not have those<br>
qualities in common, if we were not similar in that way, we would not be<br>
communicating right now. We would have no will or desire to share in a<br>
creative process within "space and time". <br>
<p>
People are attracted to each other and brought together by their<br>
similarities. I go to mechanic because we have a similar interest in<br>
making my car run, though our motives of course differ. I can only<br>
communicate with the mechanic about my car to the degree that we have<br>
had similar experiences with cars. And since I have a superficial<br>
understanding of my car, I will have a superficial conversation with my<br>
mechanic ... no matter how much we both will me to understand. Lets say<br>
the mechanic is a really nice guy and thats all that I required in order<br>
for him to be my friend, we must either find something in common to do<br>
or talk about or else one or both of us must attune to the other in<br>
order to conform in some fashion and thus create similarity. We seek<br>
similarity when we want depth, and difference when we want to expand.<br>
But to expand we must become similar to that which we were previously<br>
different.<br>
