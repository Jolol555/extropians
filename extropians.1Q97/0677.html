<i>&gt; Duh, in physics there's a widely-used concept of "order of magnitude"</i><br>

<i>&gt; factor of ten. Whether it's fifteen or six tons is immaterial, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's certainly *not* ten thousand tons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not at all. I was referring to atmospheric impacts. According to James,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; earthgov will still need to build and use meganukes to have as much of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an impact under vacuum conditions as a much smaller nuke would on earth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But as I pointed out, by James calculations a 10MT groundburst nuke on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon will have the roughly same effect on underground structures as on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth.</i><br>
<p>
No he showed a massive difference in ground penetration with the<br>
advantage to rocks. He also compared what would be needed for<br>
equivalence in damage on earth for a 10MT nuke and a rock. I am<br>
proposing using smaller rocks, preformed as conic atmospheric<br>
penetrators, so the drag as on a meteor would be much less, in higher<br>
quantities.<br>
<p>
Also, the lunar terrain is much less conducive to shocks than earth<br>
terrain. What you are referring to is the whole structure of the moon<br>
being cool to the core, so it conducts sound throughout the moon, but<br>
not in the local scale as easily as earth does, as earth has a much<br>
higher moisture content (0% vs 40%) that greatly amplifies the effects<br>
of underground shock (any of you in SF know this from the damage in the<br>
Marina area during the quake as opposed to say, the top of Russian<br>
Hill.)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As you all have read my statements before, that war strategically is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; competition of cost effectiveness in battle. These two differences, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gravitational potential and environment, between earth and the moon are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; significant in giving any lunar David a much more even hand against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; terran Goliath.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The moon has a factor of four energy advantage, Earth has nukes; That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. </i><br>
<p>
Apparently its not, as a rock makes a deeper hole, and since earth<br>
assets are above ground for all but  few sites, the atmospheric shock<br>
waves on earth are the kicker, so the damage radius is greater on earth<br>
than on the moon. Lunar subterranean structures, even the regolith, have<br>
not been subject to exposure to water for millenia, and so are much less<br>
conducive toward ground shocks than earth terrain.<br>
