<i>&gt; I do.  You must not know people who blow large amounts of money on gambling</i><br>
<i>&gt;tables.  I do.  Being wrong on the issues I mentioned is a serious detriment,</i><br>
<i>&gt;except for perhaps the age of the earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We may be disagreeing on how easy it is to research.  It is relative to</i><br>
<i>&gt;educational level, but anybody with a junior high education should be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;read and use a library catalogue and that's all I think these require.</i><br>
<p>
The ability to read is not enough; one needs to understand the<br>
concepts the words refer to.  There is also a selection bias issue<br>
here.  Even if it were worth these people's time to go research these<br>
particular issues you have identified, from these people's point of<br>
view these issues are mixed in with hundreds of other issues which are<br>
important to them, and where they suspect common practice is mistaken.<br>
Should they go to the library to research *all* such questions?<br>
<p>
Anyway, we have moved away from your claim that you can easily<br>
generate examples to demonstrate the ubiquity of "opinion divergence<br>
on matters of fact, where each side knows of the other's opinion".<br>
Your only example so far is of religious fundamentalists, which still<br>
leaves open the possiblity that aside from religious wackos, most of<br>
us are reasonable people.  A better example for your case might be the<br>
OJ trial, though opinions on race come close to religion in many ways.<br>
