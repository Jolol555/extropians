<p>
Because it is a policy of the list that "the basics are not up for<br>
discussion".  If libertarian politics are an extropian basic, then its<br>
value is not up to discussion.  This isn't avoiding criticism; it is a<br>
dedication of the list to discussion *given certain values*,<br>
specifically techno-transhumanism and libertarianism.<br>
<p>
At least that's what I believe the state of affairs to be, and I presume<br>
it is what the Squirrel* believes affairs to be.  If we are wrong Max<br>
More or Tom Morrow can say so.<br>
<p>
*Given that the un-libertarian Squirrel calls himself the (First)<br>
Extropian Squirrel, presumably that transrodent does not believe<br>
libertarianism actually is basic to extropianism.  There is no<br>
contradiction: the Squirrel may view this list as an overly restrictive<br>
forum for discussing extropy, but the only such forum there is.<br>
