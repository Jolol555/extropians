<p>
I would also differentiate between Libertarians and Republicans.<br>
Republicans are statists and mercantilists, the opposite of<br>
libertarians. They also let a heavy amount of religious dogma to hold<br>
sway over principles.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is not true that they hold this beleif. Libertarians beleive in</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; proceed unimpeded to improve the human condition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An equally irrational belief.  It is doubtful that you can show a</i><br>
<i>&gt; case in which a pure free market economy has actually improved the</i><br>
<i>&gt; human condition for more than few decades before producing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; condition in which the wealth becomes so severely imbalanced that</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who are not already amongst the wealthy elite have little</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity for advancement regardless of their ability or</i><br>
<i>&gt; willingness to work.  A situation that does not produce equality of</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity, and that does not improve the human condition.</i><br>
<p>
considering that true free markets have yet to accrue ANY history, your<br>
assertion is true, but only due to a lack of history. Here we must rely<br>
on simulations unless we actually jump in with both hands. I would say<br>
however that any imbalance is not a matter of free markets, but<br>
government/mercantilist collusion to bias the market in favor of those<br>
in power.<br>
<p>
What you see as the human condition is the every day living conditions<br>
of the average man, while I look at it as a more long term trend toward<br>
allowing the market to maintain evolution's pace on humanity, rather<br>
than using a controlled market to dumb down the genetic pool by coddling<br>
the lower end of the bell curve. I see progress as an effect of<br>
evolution on improving the average quality of the stock, rather than<br>
cultivating the genes of the lowest quality strains, as the current<br>
welfare state does.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An op-amp circuit with strong positive feedback will tend not</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards balance, but to lockup in either an extreme positive or</i><br>
<i>&gt; extreme negative state.  Ungoverned free market economies also have</i><br>
<i>&gt; strong positive feedback, and share this same characteristic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Imagine each individual as an op-amp.  Those who are wealthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; (positive) beyond a certain admittedly fuzzy threshold will tend to</i><br>
<i>&gt; become more wealthy (extraordinary stupidity can change that, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm talking about a tendency, not an outcome that is certain in</i><br>
<i>&gt; every case), while those below that threshold will tend to lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; ground.  The further you are from either side of that threshold, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; less likely it is that you can cross it by your intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort alone (or lack thereof, in the case of crossing the threshold</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the negative direction).</i><br>
<p>
This is true, any mechanism operating on positive feedback will<br>
occillate out of control, however, only when the feedback mechanism is<br>
opposed by an asymptotic function, like the employment utility curve.<br>
Mechanisms operating on positive feedback do occillate out of control<br>
when operating in a closed environment. Given unlimited resources,<br>
positive feedback does not cause such behavior, so once space travel and<br>
nanotech becomes practical, we wont be constrained by such limitations.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; THis is why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; libertarians tend to be highly intelligent, educated, and average</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; high incomes, as they practice what they preach. THis unfortunately</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; limits the growth of the party, as the principles of libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tend to disfavor those with deficiencies which inhibit economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; excellence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your superiority complex is unimpressive.  I will be happy to discuss</i><br>
<i>&gt; and debate issues with you since you are intelligent enough to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas worth thinking about, and to present an intellectual challenge</i><br>
<i>&gt; for those matters on which we disagree.  But I have no interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; watching you stroke your ego.</i><br>
<p>
No ego ruffling there, simply stating facts reported by surveys of<br>
libertarians. Notice I didn't say they were attractive.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I personally tend to think that children should be raised in equal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; social circumstances, to allow as close to an equal level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; opportunity as possible, but once they reach whatever is considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "adulthood", they live by TANSTAAFL.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm...  That is an interesting idea.  I'm not sure whether I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree with it or not.  It seems like something that would be a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing if it could be made to happen, but might be extremely difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; to realize.  Perhaps you have thought of some way to bring this</i><br>
<i>&gt; about?  Would this be an area where the traditional a-c opposition to</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare might be relaxed?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This gets back to that issue of equality of opportunity vs. equality</i><br>
<i>&gt; of result.  I think we are in at least partial agreement on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept, just not on how to achieve it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Society does not owe anyone a living, but it does owe everyone an</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity to be productive and to be fairly rewarded for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; productivity.  Proposing the idea that society "owes" anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything will probably ruffle some feathers, but consider:  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; little purpose in constructing a society of any kind if not for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit of the members of that society.  I construct machines to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; my slaves, not to be enslaved by them.  The same should be true of</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything we construct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As libertarian as I tend to be, I still have had enough personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; experience with people I call "trust fund babies" to consider huge</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; inheritances as a net evolutionary disadvantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then perhaps we are not as much in disagreement as it might appear</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the surface.  I simply propose that such problems are too often</i><br>
<i>&gt; glossed over, and that avoiding such issues cannot come to any</i><br>
<i>&gt; productive end.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Am totally against confiscation of assets one earns. Confiscation of<br>
unearned income or assets is not a problem with me, since such assets<br>
are unearned, they never belonged to the taxee to begin with.<br>
<p>
The massive accrual of wealth that you describe, Bill Gates<br>
notwithstanding, is typically a function of continuous inheritance,<br>
generation after generation, than individuals monopolizing a marketplace<br>
or asset base. Such market/asset consolidation usually takes two to four<br>
generations.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is a decent idea so long as you don't propose taking wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; away from people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My point was only that free markets produce beneficial results when</i><br>
<i>&gt; they start with a reasonably flat distribution of wealth. I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose that it would be beneficial to force them into that</i><br>
<i>&gt; condition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I cannot say that taking wealth away is unacceptable in</i><br>
<i>&gt; every possible case.  If an economy becomes so imbalanced that one</i><br>
<i>&gt; man owns everything, do the rest of us simply starve to death?   Such</i><br>
<i>&gt; a situation would most likely be corrected by a violent revolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Probably well before it became that extreme.  So when should the</i><br>
<i>&gt; killing start?  20% with 80% of the wealth?  10% with 90%?  1% with</i><br>
<i>&gt; 99%?  One guy with everything?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Economic polarization cannot go indefinately without some kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; corrective measure.  If not by application of law, then by collapse</i><br>
<i>&gt; into depression or by violence.  But by some means it will end.  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the op-amp with positive feedback, extreme polarization is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural tendency of a pure free market economy.  Then it destroys</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself and everything must start all over. An endless oscillation</i><br>
<i>&gt; that starts by building up from nothing, a period of prosperity with</i><br>
<i>&gt; a large middle class, a period of increasing polarization and</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing unrest, then collapse into depression (or bloody</i><br>
<i>&gt; revolution) and it all begins again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is my model of what would happen with an economy that has zero</i><br>
<i>&gt; governmental regulation.  I am not accusing the rich of being evil.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The victors don't have to be monsters (though there is no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; they can't be).  It does not require any criminal wrong doing.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt; one has to be forced or deceived into making a spending decision.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just successful business practices carried to their ultimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion.  The inevitable outcome of any successful implementation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the anarcho-capitalistic ideal.  Maybe I'm wrong. I'm sure many</i><br>
<i>&gt; will disagree with my model.  I doubt that there is any historical</i><br>
<i>&gt; precedent that can confirm or disprove since such a system will</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely not complete a single cycle of the oscillation without being</i><br>
<i>&gt; altered in some way during the period of unrest (i.e. government</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulation and/or introduction of some element of socialism) making</i><br>
<i>&gt; it impossible to fully isolate the cause even if it does follow</i><br>
<i>&gt; through to a revolution or a collapse into a depression. Many would</i><br>
<i>&gt; blame the increasing governmental regulation for the collapse.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend more to blame the impending collapse for the increasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; government regulation.  Last resort measures in an attempt to save a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sinking ship.  I'd be happy to hear any alternative models you might</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to offer. And any reasons that you think my model is wrong or</i><br>
<i>&gt; that some other one is more accurate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Making everyone start at zero once they reach</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; adulthood is what I would call equality of opportunity, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; redistributing the wealth isn't, its penalizing success.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This reminds me of an interesting idea that was proposed as a thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiment by a man I used to work with.  Put aside your distaste for</i><br>
<i>&gt; taxation for a moment and contemplate the outcome of this:  A 100%</i><br>
<i>&gt; post-mortem tax, but no other.  It all goes to the state when you</i><br>
<i>&gt; die.  Attempts to cheat the system by giving substantial gifts will</i><br>
<p>
Of course there could and should probably be minimal levels of gifts,<br>
like the present $10,000/yr gift allowance, which is useful for<br>
educational and entrepreneurial seed money, but not to accrue vast<br>
transfer of  assests.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; result in having the tax applied early, effectively pressing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reset button on your life.  You are entitled to keep and enjoy</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever you rightfully earn (outright theft and fraud would still be</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal) within your own life, but are entitled to nothing that was</i><br>
<i>&gt; earned by anyone else regardless of relation, except perhaps that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; revenue from the post-mortem tax might be used to provide education</i><br>
<i>&gt; prior to going out on your own, and perhaps a few other public</i><br>
<i>&gt; services that would have to stay entirely within budget.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I realize that the possibility of extended lifespans screws up this</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario, but it is interesting to think about none the less.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Extended lifespans only stretch out the time to confiscation, allowing<br>
greater capital appreciation. As an example, Bill Gates has publicly<br>
stated that he plans on giving all of his wealth away by the time he<br>
dies.<br>
<p>
here's another idea derived from my Uncle Marty's concept of how life<br>
should be. He thinks that people should be retired until they are 45,<br>
then they should work until they die. He figures most of the stuff<br>
people wait until they are retired to do, is too strenuous to do by the<br>
time they get there, so best do it in youth. Based on this idea, and our<br>
present economy that is increasingly putting a premium on skill,<br>
knowledge, intelligence, etc., that people should start working when<br>
they finally start becoming skilled enough to make significant<br>
contributions. Prior to that, education, exploration, etc. should be the<br>
norm.<br>
