<i>&gt;Well, that sure attracted comment!  Not so much by so many people, as by</i><br>
<i>&gt;so many (2) Extropian heavyweights.  Which in itself is cause for</i><br>
<i>&gt;comment; why did only the Extropian elite notice this statement?  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;forget that.</i><br>
<p>
Well, gee, I guess I'd better comment. Especially if I can get credit <br>
by association. :)<br>
<p>
As I hope my recent posts will support, I'm concentrating on the <br>
social/societal issues facing those who would lead very different <br>
lives facilitated by anticipated technologies which free us from old <br>
limitations. Part of that is addressing _what it means to be human_ <br>
rather than assuming I know what to leave out.<br>
<p>
Does that make me a capital-E Extropian? or a capital-T <br>
Transhuman? Or just a propeller-head with a bent for moral <br>
philosophy? Should I care, as long as I'm doing my best?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The point being, oh James Rogers, oh Max More, that you two are, as I</i><br>
<i>&gt;said, the few Extropians who think about IA.  </i><br>
<p>
See above. I'd rather be doing the thinking and exploring I'm doing <br>
than earn your capital-E rating. :) :) And how does two people<br>
posting equate to only two people thinking about it? I think I see an <br>
questionable chain of reasoning here...<br>

And then JR said:<br>

          ism, -ism  n   A body of beliefs with a toe tag.<br>
