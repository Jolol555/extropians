You will not accept the reasonableness of Bayesian inference for the<br>
purpose of a discussion on another topic, unless someone here will<br>
summarize for you the vast literature on the normative arguments for<br>
Bayesian inference, and solve the problem in induction to your<br>
satisfaction in the process?  Come now, your behavior here seems a<br>
good example of the error of refusing to give any weight to the<br>
opinions of others, unless they present to you, at your convenience<br>
and in a form you can quickly understand, all the evidence behind<br>
their opinions.<br>
