The problem here is that the state has spent so long nursing and<br>
nannying people that they are unprepared for the responsibility of doing<br>
it themselves. This is made worse by virtue of it being a withdrawal of<br>
previously extant income. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't most<br>
species have mechanisms to adapt to lean times? If food is short,<br>
reproduction decreases; smaller broods and less of them. It is<br>
unfortunate that these people find themselves in a situation of sudden<br>
deprivation, their reproductive decisions (conscious or not) were made<br>
based on an energy supply of x. They now find themselves with x/2.<br>
Result? A problem. Our particularly long nurturing period (inception to<br>
the point where the offspring can sustain itself to a significant degree<br>
- artificially inflated in todays western society) doesn't help. Most<br>
species would suffer perhaps a year, perhaps less, of hungry offspring<br>
and more mouths to feed than there was food to go around. We're not so<br>
lucky, with perhaps 15 years to get through.<br>
<p>
These families have my sympathy, and if people I knew (friends, family,<br>
neighbours) found themselves in this situation I might be prepared to<br>
help out financially if I could, but that is a decision only *I* can<br>
make. I cannot make it for the guy down the road who's in gainful<br>
employment paying taxes to support someone elses children when he has<br>
trouble keep a roof over the heads of his own family. You may not be<br>
aware of it but in the current welfare structure in Britain it can be<br>
financially advantageous *not* to work (I expect to take a *lot* of<br>
flack for that one 8). <br>
<p>
So what do you propose? To perpetuate a problem? To treat the symptoms<br>
instead of the disease? That's like using a sticking plaster to cover a<br>
gaping wound. It's unsustainable and it's unfair and IMHO it should<br>
never have happened. Unfortunately it did and there's nothing we can do<br>
to change that. We *can* try to make things better for the future<br>
though. I'm not saying that the welfare system is being dismantled in<br>
the kindest manner possible, or even the most rational, but I back the<br>
*principle* wholeheartedly.<br>
<p>
Right. Time to don the Kevlar and await the inevitable.<br>
