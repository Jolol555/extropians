<i>&gt;I always heard that economics was referred to as "the dismal science"</i><br>

<p>
Here is the exact quote:<br>
<p>
  And the Social Science, -- not a "gay science", but a rueful, --<br>
  which find the secret of this Universe in "supply and demand," and<br>
  redues the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone, is<br>
  also wonderful.  Not a "gay science," I should say, like some we have<br>
  heard of; no a dreary, desolate, and indeed quite abject and<br>
  distressing one; what we might call, by way of eminence, the dismal<br>
  science.   These two, Exter-Hall Philanthropy and the Dismal Science,<br>
  led by any sacred cause of Black Emancipation, or the like, to fall in<br>
  love and make a wedding of it, -- will give birth to progenies and<br>
  prodigies; dark extensive moon-calves, unnameable abortions,<br>
  wide-coiled monstrosities, such as the world has not seen hithertoo!<br>
  (Carlyle "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question", 1849, pp 672-3.)<br>
<p>
<p>
Looking up Carlyle in a Reader's Companion, the entry talks about his<br>
being anti Mob Democracy and anti Materialism, but doesn't mention his<br>
racism.  Two pages on him in Barlett's Quotations also don't mention<br>
his racism!<br>
<p>
Davy Levy claimed to me in person, and I now believe him, that there<br>
has been a great effort to distort our intellectual history in this<br>
area.  According to Levy:<br>
<p>
The fact is that early socialists tended to ally with and be<br>
pro-slavery folks, and these economists were anti-slavery and<br>
pro-birth-control.  The socialists complained that the economists<br>
cared less about the "white slavery" of British workers than about<br>
black slaves, and these socialists looked favorably on the slave<br>
system as a form of socialism (people working for the "state" instead<br>
of themselves).<br>
<p>
Later socialists and Marxists painted themselves as pro-labor, vs. the<br>
economists being pro-capital, and so pro-socialist historians have<br>
ignored the the race and gender views of early socialists and<br>
economists, where the economists come out looking lots better by<br>
modern standards.   This white-wash has been made easier by the fact<br>
that Marx himself came from the economic tradition, and so shared<br>
their views on race and gender. <br>
