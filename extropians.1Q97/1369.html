QueeneMUSE writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &lt;&lt;  before this discussion started, I invited QueeneMUSE </i><br>
<i>&gt;   to study mathematics (and I got no response at the time).  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; so you think you can be abusive and still have response from the queene?</i><br>
<i>&gt; forget that lyle -  </i><br>
<i>&gt; i respnded last time becuase you were nice</i><br>
<i>&gt; N  </i><br>
<p>
I was nice the first time.  Back in October, when I wrote the bit about   <br>
the laser show in a cathedral full of mirrors, I had been nice to you,   <br>
you had been nice to me, you and I were very friendly.  This continued <br>
until Nov 1, when you wrote, concerning my relationship with Leslie, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, I think it qualifies as anachronistic, adolescent,</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited by tradition,  sexist meme!  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OooooH! Sorry,  Now i know what you mean by "real artist"!</i><br>
<i>&gt; A dead one.   </i><br>
<p>
This, about the best friend I ever had...<br>
and now I'm the one who is <br>
"abusive"... what perfect female logic.  <br>
<p>
What I said about Abel was graphic, but it was absolutely true, and there <br>
was nothing abusive about it.  A genius can't be stopped by anything <br>
short of death.  A genius will do anything, literally anything, to pursue <br>
his vision, even if he has to starve and spit blood.  That's the level <br>
on which the game is played.  When believers in the equality meme <br>
tell me that women would be geniuses if only their school counsellors <br>
didn't discourage them, it's bullshit.  <br>
