<i>&gt;  I understood your claim about evolution perfectly well. What I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand are the standards you are applying to Strauss &amp; Howe's theory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which are either stricter than those you apply to the theory of evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; or else are standards which Strauss &amp; Howe's theory can, if correct, pass.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Of course it's much easier to attack creationism than to address my points.</i><br>
<p>
When you put the question that way (which you haven't before), it has<br>
a different answer: I apply precisely the same standard of proof to<br>
S&amp;H that I would to Darwin; but S&amp;H do not.  S&amp;H publish a book full<br>
of content-free musings without a single measurement or test or even<br>
proposed tests.  Their theories /might be/ quantifiable and testable,<br>
if they wrote them that way, but they don't.<br>
<p>
In all honesty, many important scientific books fail in the same<br>
way.  For example, Dennet's _Consciousness Explained_ and Ridley's<br>
_Red Queen_ do indeed extrapolate a lot from scant evidence; but<br>
there are large differences: (1) Both propose specific tests that<br>
can be performed to confirm/falsify their theories, (2) Both men<br>
have a reputation for honest, significant, rigorous science.  (3)<br>
Both works a very limited in scope, and do not even come remotely<br>
close to making wild claims such as what 5 billion free wills may<br>
do in coming decades. (4) Both list many alternative threories,<br>
and give their solid reasons for why they have rejected them.  In<br>
short, they are men of scientific integrity, and they have earned<br>
my trust.  S&amp;H have earned only publicity and sales.<br>
<p>
Time is valuable.  My time and mental resources can be spent on only<br>
a finite number of books and other information sources.  From all of<br>
the available evidence I have of S&amp;H's books, including discussions<br>
here and the content of their web pages, I see no evidence that taking<br>
the time to read the whole book would produce any benefit for me in<br>
terms of increased knowledge or skills or even entertainment, because<br>
everything I /have/ read is meaningless nonsense and carefully-picked<br>
biased sample sets.<br>
<p>
The time I spend excoriating new-agers in public forums might also<br>
appear to have little benefit to me, but at least I enjoy it :-)<br>
