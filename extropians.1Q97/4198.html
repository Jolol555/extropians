I agree it is not like imagination, but it is also not like seeing the<br>
real world either. Perhaps a better analogy would be of remembering in<br>
which case the computer is accessing the memory of another computer. But<br>
it is still remembering an image that is not from the real world. It is<br>
not seeing in that sense of seeing. At best, it is seeing<br>
metaphorically. If computer A was able to access the memory of another<br>
computer, computer B, which had hardware for seeing the real world, then<br>
computer A could then be said to have the ability to see via computer B.<br>
But at some point along the chain, hardware must exist for recieving<br>
data from the physical world.<br>

I can watch a movie and people might look like they are being killed,<br>
but they are not *really* being killed. Its an illusion. What you are<br>
talking about is an illusion of walking. What I am talking about is real<br>
walking. The difference: One is an abstract concept or emulation of<br>
walking, and the other is ACTUAL walking. I can go to a video arcade and<br>
play a simulation driving game, but I am not really driving anywhere. I<br>
may go through all the motions of driving, and I might even be tricked<br>
into feeling a sense of movement, but I have not driven anywhere. I am<br>
still in the same location as I was when I put the quarters in the<br>
machine.<br>
<p>
What you are asking for is suspended disbelief. You want me to entertain<br>
your illusions. But just as I will not entertain the illusion of a<br>
Christian god, I will not entertain the illusion of artificial life. I<br>
am not saying that we will not be able to create life from silicon or<br>
something else, but what I am saying is that it will not be called<br>
artificial life, for artificial life is just that, artificial. It is not<br>
real. To date it has been nothing more than a model, and a poor model at<br>
that of life. This is not to say it will remain this way. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  but that is like saying computers don't do math until the results</i><br>
<i>&gt; are printed on paper.</i><br>
<p>
No it is not. Math is an abstract concept. It can take place in abstract<br>
space. Math does not require legs as walking does, math does not require<br>
sensations as emotions do, math does require hardware though. Math<br>
requires a computational device, either a computer or a brain capable of<br>
processing mathematics. <br>
