[Michael Wiik:]<br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me quite intuitively obvious why there are more male</i><br>
<i>&gt; geniuses than female. Lacking the time and motivation to defend this</i><br>
<i>&gt; assertion, I nonetheless welcome comments.</i><br>
<p>
I'm speechless.  How does one rotate one's finger about one's ear in<br>
ASCII?  "Intuitively obvious?"  Well, so was Fermat's last theorem. <br>
Comments?  Comments on what?  The twisted, nay, sprained, mind that<br>
tossed a controversial statement out of nowhere with the remark that<br>
it's intuitively obvious?  What makes it intuitively obvious?  Or is<br>
there a reason?  Are you arguing that there's a conceptual primitive<br>
which assigns male superiority a high truth value?  Why should we<br>
believe that it's intuition rather than instinct?  Or are you just<br>
toying with our minds?  How does this statement differ from:  "It seems<br>
to me quite intuitively obvious why the Australians shot JFK?"<br>
<p>
What is it about male supremacists that they take male intellectual<br>
superiority for *granted*, as if *we* had something to prove?  Why isn't<br>
the default hypothesis that *females* are of superior intelligence? <br>
After all, there was quite a time during the Middle Ages when smart boys<br>
either went to the big cities and died of disease or became celibate<br>
priests.  Any genius sex-linked genes that came out of that must have<br>
been on the X chromosome, and while males do have *one* X, Algernon's<br>
Law says that you probably need multiple mutations to wind up with a<br>
real genius.<br>
<p>
At this point, I'm becoming ready to give up.  "On the generous<br>
assumption that a female genius is possible..."  "It seems to me quite<br>
intuitively obvious why there are more male geniuses than female." <br>
These people (de Garis and Wiik) aren't even bothering to argue.  They<br>
make bald, unvarnished, unbacked assertions about a field of cognitive<br>
science that we're still trying to crack, claim it's obvious, refuse to<br>
defend it, use it to justify treating most of the human race as<br>
second-class citizens, and when we balk, they call it "political<br>
correctness".<br>
<p>
It seems to me quite intuitively obvious why they should all be taken<br>
out and shot.  Lacking the time and motivation to defend this assertion,<br>
I nonetheless welcome comments.<br>
<p>
[Oh, and a note:  "Political correctness" is used to refer to demands<br>
that a particular terminology be used (or not used), or insisting that<br>
one respect a particular sub-culture in defiance of the melting pot, or<br>
insisting that Ebonics be taught in school, or some such.  It is NOT<br>
proper usage, simply derogatory, to use it to refer to the political<br>
cause of treating all humans as symmetrical with respect to ethics, the<br>
law, default maximum potential, and social opportunity.]<br>
