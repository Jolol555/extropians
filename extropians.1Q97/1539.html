Not having examined the proof myself, I will grant that his mistake was one<br>
of physical intuition and not mathematics.  But that still does not change<br>
the fact that something that was accepted as gospel truth for almost 30 <br>
years was a proof that in the words of Bell: "falls apart in your hands".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Victor J Stenger contradicts both Bell and Mermim (and presumably</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bell said it was silly and irrelevant, he did not say it had a mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; error.</i><br>
<p>
I remind you that Bell didn't just say it was silly, but: "It's not just <br>
flawed, it's silly."  A phrase that I think very clearly means it's silly<br>
because it's so flawed.  Ok, the flaw was one of physical intuition, we've<br>
established that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Cramer's transactional interpretation does not necessarily imply</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;non- locality so much as the fact that local causal principles</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;propagate (on the microcausal level) symmetrically bidirectionally</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;through time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If it's true then right now we are causing things to happen in the Vergo</i><br>
<i>&gt; cluster of galaxies before the Earth even existed. how could you get more</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-local than that?</i><br>
<p>
Actually, the virgo cluster of galaxies from "before the Earth even existed",<br>
to the extent that it is on our past light cone, is not in any way non-local.<br>
Things that are separated by a zero spacetime interval are local by definition<br>
within Einsteinian relativity.  It only seems non-local because your semantic<br>
definition of local does not agree with the one used by Einsteinian relativity<br>
that, so far as we know, describes the reality in which we live. <br>
<p>
I certainly agree that there are unresolved paradoxes in this stuff, but the<br>
first order of business in penetrating these paradoxes is to jettison semantic<br>
definitions that don't correspond to the known laws of physics.<br>
<p>
This does not even involve QM yet.  The reason QM is so mysterious is that<br>
we have yet to fully adjust our thoughts and semantic definitions to fully<br>
reflect the reality described by Einsteinian relativity.  There are paradoxes<br>
here, but these paradoxes are unresolved issues in Einsteinian relativity in<br>
exactly this area.  QM is actually what resolves the paradox.<br>
<p>
More on this later.<br>
