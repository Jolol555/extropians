You're making a classic mistake here. US-specific email addresses end in<br>
.us; .com is a global domain. Www.unicorn.com is in California, and my<br>
mail goes through that site, but it ends up on my laptop, which has lived<br>
in twelve different countries in the last year. Currently I'm living in<br>
Britain, which is why I mentioned it. <br>

The problem, of course, is that socialism is antithetical to transhuman<br>
ideas. We're all for change and socialism is the most sophisticated<br>
attempt yet to prevent change and create a static society. How many of the<br>
transhuman ideas we've talked about originated in socialist countries? How<br>
many will be allowed in such countries? After all, no-one has a right to<br>
immortality until all the homeless have color TVs... <br>

<p>
Actually I think that the Federal government is rushing towards a<br>
socialist dictatorship as rapidly as they can get there, but the people<br>
seem to be heading in the opposite direction. Rather like China in fact; a<br>
massive socialist government trying to rule over an extremely capitalist<br>
population (at least in the big cities). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any political systems influence is just what the individual makes of it,</i><br>

<p>
No... it's much harder to succeed in a socialist system because the entire<br>
system is designed to bring everyone down to the same level, and being<br>
smart and creative is often considered dangerous by the people who might<br>
hire you. Taken to extremes, look what Stalin did to anyone with a brain. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Whereas these</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual characteristics mean little in a politically/socially stable</i><br>
<i>&gt; society (!), they tend to flourish in one that is subject to rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt; change... ;-) </i><br>
<p>
Exactly. And socialism is all about stability. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I had really</i><br>
<i>&gt; hoped the open mindedness of the scope of time all of you discuss space</i><br>
<i>&gt; exploration and the future in general in, would have reflected a little bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; more on your political/social and historical perspectives. </i><br>
<p>
On a small-scale (e.g. a group of friends sharing a house) socialism often<br>
does make sense. But it's a voluntary agreement for efficiency reasons<br>
rather than a compulsory arrangement enforced at gunpoint. <br>
<p>
I think most people around here would choose libertarianism or<br>
anarcho-capitalism as their ideal political system. Both, of course, allow<br>
people to set up their own voluntary socialist organisations within the<br>
capitalist structure, but not to force their opinions on the capitalists. <br>
One thing that people seem to miss is that capitalism (or at least<br>
libertarian or anarcho-capitalism) is a superset of other kinds of<br>
political organisations, which is why it's preferable to any of them. You<br>
can't have a capitalist community in a communist society, but you can<br>
easily have a voluntary communist community in an capitalist society. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But instead you</i><br>
<i>&gt; all seem to assume a capitalist democracy in its current form (The United</i><br>
<i>&gt; States of Earth ?) ruling the universe for eons to come i guess. </i><br>
<p>
Not exactly. I'd be surprised if either the US or EU still exist in their<br>
current form in twenty years time. Of course, if the Chinese government<br>
get out of the way then Chinese anarcho-capitalists may well be ruling the<br>
universe instead... <br>
