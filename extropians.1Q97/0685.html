<i>&gt;                 &gt;I don't share your pessimism; you seem to think that anything </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Noncomputable is never going to be explained </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If an event does not have a cause there is nothing to explain.</i><br>
<p>
Well, since I believe in quantum mechanics, I guess I can just give up<br>
and go to church, then.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;it seems to me that noncomputable things exerting causal </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;influences on our Universe are part of the "laws of physics" </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;and can thus be examined by the tools of science.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If an event does not have a cause there is nothing to examine.</i><br>
<p>
So you *don't* believe in quantum mechanics, then?  I mean, what are we<br>
examining and explaining, in quantum mechanics, if not random,<br>
non-causal events which obey precise but probabilistic mathematical<br>
rules?<br>
<p>
Point being: noncomputability is not synonymous with non-causal, and<br>
non-causal is not synonymous with epiphenomenal, and *only* epiphenomena<br>
(dual-aspect theory things) mean you should give up and go to church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What would make me shave my head and put on my saffron robes is if something</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple and had no parts could produce something as complex and glorious as</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness or even intelligence. I'm willing to accept the Bit and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Induction as axioms, but I draw the line at consciousness, it would mean that</i><br>
<i>&gt; science could not help us in the one area that was most interesting to every</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of us. Science would be like plumbing, useful at times but dull as</i><br>
<i>&gt; dishwater.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  I think that Chalmers and Searle are both wrong, dual-aspect<br>
epiphenomal theories are just plain silly, and "zombies" who write<br>
elaborate treatises on consciousness are logically inconsistent.  I<br>
refuse to accept consciousness as a basic, structureless part of the<br>
world; it clearly exerts a complex causal influence on our thoughts and<br>
is therefore examinable by the laws of physics.  Suggesting that<br>
consciousness should be placed on a level with mass or spacetime, as<br>
Chalmers would have it, is tantamount to giving up, and calling<br>
consciousness a "soul" doesn't solve a damn thing.  I don't think that<br>
consciousness can be identical with the instantiation of some<br>
computation, but I do expect it to be identical with some complex,<br>
objective physical phenomenon embodying many of the properties which we<br>
ascribe to consciousness, including, for example, inherent unity of the<br>
experiential field - something that seems impossible with discrete ones<br>
and zeroes.<br>
<p>
I don't see it in terms of "giving up and going to church", just in<br>
terms of "giving up".  Are we in methodological agreement anyway?<br>
