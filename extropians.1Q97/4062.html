<i>&gt; CSICOP are themselves about as credible as the above mentioned accused. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more interested in maintaining their DOGMA (early 20th century scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding) than in finding the truth. They have repeatedly refused to</i><br>
<i>&gt; publish ANY papers that might suggest there are "psi" phenomona at work. For a</i><br>
<i>&gt; scathing critique of CSICOP I suggest you read Robert Anton Wilson's "New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Inquistion".</i><br>
<p>
That particular hatchet-job, which I have indeed read, is just a sloppy<br>
attempt at faulting CSICOP for doing what they were created to do, and not<br>
necessarily what Wilson or others think they should do.  CSICOP's mission<br>
is to be skeptical; that's their charter.  They have no interest in being<br>
"balanced" or presenting "suggestive" evidence for psi, because there is<br>
more than enough support for such ideas elsewhere.  Their mission is to<br>
demonstrate that every piece of so-called evidence for psi phenomena can<br>
be adequately and more simply explained by chance and trickery.  They do<br>
quite an admirable job of that, and are a good source of info on that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As far as Puthoff is concerned, he has published several papers regarding ZPF</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the Casimir effect in "Physics A" - a conservative journal if there ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; was one.</i><br>
<p>
The Casimir effect is a real observation, and demands further research and<br>
explanation.  The early explanations offered by Puthoff and others may very<br>
well turn out to be the right ones--time will tell.  But given that he has<br>
been duped in the past, I feel quite justified in being skeptical of his<br>
claims now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Regarding Flieshman and Pons, their only mistake was bad Public Relations. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; verdict is not out yet on cold fusion - there are still too many experiments</i><br>
<i>&gt; acheiving anomolous results and excess energy. Every so called critic of cold</i><br>
<i>&gt; fusion I've heard so far has yet to present solid unrefutable evidence to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; contrary.</i><br>
<p>
Their mistake was not behaving like scientists at all.  They called press<br>
conferences before getting their work reviewed, and before letting anyone<br>
else reproduce their result.  To date, no one has reproduced their result.<br>
There is no reason to suspect cold fusion isn't possible, and those who<br>
dismiss any such attempt are indeed being hasty.  But possibility doesn't<br>
equal a repeated experiment.  When someone with some scientific integrity<br>
produces energy that way, and others can reproduce the experiment, and<br>
it stands up to criticism, then I'll be the first in line to buy stock.<br>
<p>
Some who have heard me before decry the act of judging ideas by their<br>
holders instead of on their merits might well call me on it now.  They<br>
would be right in a sense: I am using the reputation of a man as a short<br>
cut to evaluating his ideas.  I plead guilty, but with some justification.<br>
I am not exercising /final/ judgment on the ideas by their holders, only<br>
allowing their identity to guide what evidence I spend most time on.  And<br>
I judged the men themselves on their reactions to earlier evidence, not<br>
vice versa.  Before their cold fusion debacle, I would have given no more<br>
or less weight to the opinions of F&amp;P than to anyone else.  Now I give<br>
less.  If they reform themselves somehow, they might regain my respect.<br>
<p>
I admire theoreticians who speculate wildly on the limits of the possible.<br>
I admire experimentalists who verify and falsify their conjectures.  What<br>
I do not admire is men who mistake one for the other.<br>
