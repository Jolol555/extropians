I notice from the responses to my earlier posting on this thread that <br>
there may be some concern over my own optimistic/pessimistic state.  <br>
I won't deny that I'm carrying some wounds from my grad school <br>
experience, but at least I have a very clear understanding now of the <br>
schism that has developed between my path and the path of those I <br>
used to work with.  In some ways I was naive about how the consequences <br>
of transhumanist ideas would affect those with a stake in <br>
multiculturalism.  <br>
<p>
I appreciate the sentiment that one should not let those hostile to <br>
one's ideas stand in the way, but in some master's programs the <br>
degree committee determines your eligibility for credit, and I ran <br>
out of time (and money) to find a new degree committee member.  I now <br>
believe that degree committees exist not solely to establish academic <br>
rigor, but to perpetuate existing paradigms!<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
