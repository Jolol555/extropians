<i>&gt;	    [Nuclear proliferation, bio/chem, nanotech dangers]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Another explanation -and this brings me to the second point </i><br>
<i>&gt;           I want to make- is that many of these problems seem to call </i><br>
<i>&gt;           for solutions that clash with the libertarian doctrine held </i><br>
<i>&gt;           by many on this list. At least at first sight, it seems that </i><br>
<i>&gt;           a reformed and strengthened United Nation would be the best </i><br>
<i>&gt;           suited institution to supervise the use of very dangerous </i><br>
<i>&gt;           technologies. I know the mere mention of the UN probably </i><br>
<i>&gt;           causes some people here to want to throw up. The alternative </i><br>
<i>&gt;           would perhaps be a world where USA plays the international </i><br>
<i>&gt;           big brother role, but this raises many problems of moral </i><br>
<i>&gt;           authority, financing etc. etc.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is a good point.  Certainly in my own mind there is some<br>
cognitive dissonance between my expectation for a bright future and the<br>
knowledge of the many dangers we face to get there.  And given the lack<br>
of good, visible examples of successful anarchies in the world today,<br>
there is an uncomfortable degree of faith in my belief that a free<br>
society will give us a good chance of finding a way through the dangers.<br>
<p>
One trend I have noticed in the last few years is an attempt to downplay<br>
the risks of nanotech.  We used to hear a lot about the dangers of<br>
out of control replicators, either accidental accidents or intentional<br>
sabotage.  Now I see more about how unlikely these problems are to arise,<br>
with analogies to the difficulties of cars suddenly evolving the ability<br>
to eat trees and produce gasoline from them.  And supposedly creating a<br>
nice nasty gray goo beastie will require overcoming the billion-year-plus<br>
head start that nature has in creating her own replicators, which makes<br>
the task sound more difficult.<br>
<p>
I don't really find these arguments persuasive, and I don't know whether<br>
their success is due to the fact that I am missing the point, or whether<br>
they just fit better into people's hopes and preconceptions.  I sometimes<br>
wonder whether there is an intentional and planned effort to reduce people's<br>
fears of nanotech in order to help secure research funding.<br>
<p>
It's also worth noting that, assuming the world political system retains<br>
something like its present form for the next few decades, there's a good<br>
chance that breakthroughs into new, threatening technologies will occur<br>
in the context of military research.  This suggests that handling the<br>
matter through existing trans-national institutions may in fact be the<br>
best way to go, since these are organizations which the nation-states are<br>
well set up to deal with.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, there is obviously no guarantee that any particular<br>
organization is going to handle these technologies honestly or safely.<br>
Whether UN or USA, there is plenty of precedent for behavior which would<br>
not make us want to trust them.<br>
<p>
I want to see a free world, but I don't want my kids melting down into<br>
gray goo or dieing from a tailored virus.  It is far from clear how to<br>
steer between the problems.<br>
