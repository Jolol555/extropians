<i>&gt;While exploring Hugo de Garis's web site on brain building I came</i><br>
<i>&gt;across this rant on political correctness. He claims that genius</i><br>
<i>&gt;in an undeniably male trait. I would be interested if anyone has</i><br>
<i>&gt;a reasonable argument against his views:</i><br>
<p>
The general reasoned response to this type of statement is that it <br>
does not take into account historical realities and is probably <br>
heavily biased in Western Christian history.  You could bring up <br>
examples such as (i) that Socrates and Plato were originally the <br>
protoges of prominent female scholars (ii) that entire libraries were <br>
burned during Christian attacks on advanced 'pagan' civilizations so <br>
we don't have an accurate record of who their prominent thinkers <br>
were, (iii) that one of the greatest known ancient mathematicians of <br>
all time, Hypatia, was murdered by monks and her library burned <br>
simply because she was a woman, and (iv) what about Marie Curie, the <br>
Countess of Lovelace, Sappho?  <br>
<p>
You could also point out that until very recently most women were <br>
prohibited by law from attending school or even reading books, and that <br>
these prohibitions were often enforced through beatings or commitment to <br>
asylums.  It is believed that many women who exhibited signs of early <br>
genius were treated as socially rebellious or mentally anamolous.   <br>
