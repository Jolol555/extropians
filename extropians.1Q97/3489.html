<i>&gt;Is Kevlar similar to polymers such as cellulose, proteins and silk, or those</i><br>
<i>&gt;synthesized in laboratories and sold commercially, such as plastics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;synthetic fibers?  What I like about polymers is that they consist of up to</i><br>
<i>&gt;millions of repeated linked units, each a relatively light and simple molecule.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But with polymers we are getting into the "rubber" concept, which I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather steer clear of.  First, it is over done, second it looks cheap, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;third its passe'. I'm more interested in what is possible and what serves a</i><br>
<i>&gt;multiple-purpose:  functionality, design and bio-tech.  Especially as</i><br>
<i>&gt;prosthetics become more and more a part of our physiology.</i><br>
<p>
I'd say that Kevlar has the most in common with artificial fibres like Nylon<br>
and Orlon. I've actually made Nylon in the lab, and I wouldn't call it<br>
anything like rubber. In fact, polymers are everywhere. Everything from hair<br>
to vegetables are polymeric, and there are many inorganic polymers. Nylon<br>
made in the lab (and that's the only way to make it) starts out as a goo<br>
that must be pulled like toffee and dried as a monofilament. Ostensibly the<br>
individual molecules could be linked at a nanoscale level by an assembler of<br>
some sort. Polymer just means a string of identical (or a pattern)<br>
molecules. The only connotations with rubber come from polymers not being<br>
used for much else in consumer technology. <br>
