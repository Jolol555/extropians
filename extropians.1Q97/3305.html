Hal Finney said:<br>
The main issue which I find disturbing in cloning and similar proposals<br>
is, what about the children produced? Who defends their interests,<br>
and to what extent should I condone someone performing<br>
experiments which may lead to children who suffer from brain <br>
damage or deformities?<br>
<p>
I think this is a reasonable concern, but note that each act of <br>
"natural conception" is also an "experiment" and the rate of<br>
"natural" birth defects is significant. One could screen parents to<br>
look for whether double recessive genes might appear thru<br>
recombination but this is not commonly done. In fact, I saw a<br>
married couple on tv that had children even though they knew there<br>
was a one quarter chance each child would have cystic<br>
fibrosis. Note, here, I am not arguing about whether screening <br>
should or should not be done. I mention this example to illustrate <br>
the fact that current default ethical systems do not prevent people<br>
from creating progeny even when the danger of birth defects is high.<br>
