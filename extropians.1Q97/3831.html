Jeff Lister responds to my analogy of the marketplace to celestial mechanics--<br>
<p>
: [...]  In the last paragraph you say "human buyers/sellers," shouldn't<br>
: that be corporate/human buyers/sellers?  To extend the analogy, the humans<br>
: would be the interstellar dust from which a protosystem is currently<br>
: forming and the corperations would be the stars; initially chatoic, the<br>
: system would become more ordered with time.  The formation of the system<br>
: would initially be more dependant on the distribution of 'dust,' but<br>
: eventually dominated by the relative positions of the stars.<br>
<p>
Let's back up a bit before we get too silly:  The analogy would be better<br>
still with no stars, just a lot of massive ships moving about unpredictably,<br>
though usually their engines can't muster much acceleration.  The nearest<br>
thing to passive "stars", I think, would be the institutional investors<br>
-- pension funds and the like, which tend to trade in a mechanical way.<br>
<p>
To address your point: no group of people is a "point mass"; they all have<br>
internal forces.  I'd think of corporations as more like fleets of ships,<br>
of various sizes ...<br>
