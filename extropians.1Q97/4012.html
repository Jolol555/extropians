quoth Damien Sullivan (addressing L.D.Crocker)<br>
: ...  When, for<br>
: example, you advocate anarchist solutions, you are saying that all<br>
: societies, for all of human history, have been making the same mistake<br>
: of having government.  That's a very strong claim.  Can you pit your<br>
: logic and experience against the thought and experience of billions of<br>
: people?<br>
<p>
How many of those billions knowingly chose archy over anarchy?<br>
The largest group that can be said to have made anything like such a choice <br>
(rather than merely choosing between rival warlords) is, I would guess,<br>
those Americans who participated in the Ratification debate of 1788 --<br>
likely fewer than a million.<br>
<p>
my two cents' worth<br>
