WARNING * MOST OF THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS I HAVE MADE BEFORE. LONG TIME <br>
READERS OF THE LIST MAY WANT TO SKIP THIS POST* <br>

<i>        &gt;If I was standing on one side of the [duplicating] chamber and I now        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;appeared to be on the other side of the chamber I would know I was        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the copy.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
And if the chamber had cylindrical symmetry you could not tell if you were  <br>
the copy or not. <br>
<p>
Suppose that one second after you first saw your double, a bullet hit him in <br>
the back of the head and his brain exploded. Regardless of whether you are <br>
the copy or the original you still have all your memories and you still have <br>
a feeling on continuity with your past, just as you do now, so nobody died. <br>
If two phonographs are synchronized and playing the same symphony and you <br>
destroy one machine, the music does not stop.<br>
<p>
I think our key disagreement is that you think we are an object, I think we <br>
are a process. I can make an exact copy of a this post, lots of copies may <br>
exist in the world, but they are all the same post. You can delete your copy, <br>
but I still have mine so the post still exists. It would be crazy to say <br>
that in order to get  the most out of it you should only read the original, <br>
there is no  original, and information does not occupy a unique position in <br>
space. A brick  can't be copied exactly, at least not yet, so it doesn't <br>
have these properties, thus it makes sense to talk about two different bricks.  <br>
The fundamental question you have to ask yourself is; are we (our subjective <br>
existence) more like bricks or symphonies?  <br>
<p>
I'm not a thing. The word "I" should not be a pronoun but a adjective,   <br>
an adjective modifying matter. I am not matter, I am  the way matter reacts   <br>
when it's organized  in certain complex  ways.<br>

<i>        &gt;As one billionth of a nanosecond passed they would have diverged.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why?  One billionth of a nanosecond is far too short for human consciousness <br>
to detect. For people "now" is about a second long.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Location and structure is used to presently distinguish between them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're in a different position than you were 5 minutes ago, but presumably  <br>
your identity has not changed. Trying to develop a theory of identity or  <br>
consciousness based on position is a bad idea. Where does consciousness exist?  <br>
Where does "red" exist or "fast" or "beautiful" or the number "13"?  These  <br>
questions have no answer because they make no sense.<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;How many types of sub-atomic particles does it take to convince you        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that all atoms are not all the same?</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
An atom is not a bag of sub-atomic particles that occasionally releases its <br>
contents, that would be like saying somewhere in the human body is a <br>
"word bag" that gradually releases its contents as language, and when it's <br>
empty we become mute.<br>
               <br>

Then most of the Physics done this century has been a waste of time.<br>

<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;In Science you can exchange one atom of Hydrogen with another one        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;and the system does not change at all.  </i><br>
         <br>
<i>         &gt;Of course it changed, you just switched atoms. </i><br>
<i>         &gt;Switching is an action.        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;An action usually requires change.        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;At one time it had atom A.        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;At another time it was -A.        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;At another time it was -A + B.</i><br>
         <br>

If you're right then The Identity Of Indiscernibles is false and  so is most <br>
Science done in the last 90 years, because the foundation of modern physics <br>
is the idea of Exchange Forces, and that is a direct  consequence of The <br>
Identity Of Indiscernibles.<br>
<p>
The first philosopher to examine the principle of "The Identity Of  <br>
Indiscernibles" was Leibniz 300 years ago. He said that if there is no way  <br>
to find a difference between two things then they are identical and switching  <br>
the position of the objects does not change the physical state of the system.  <br>
Until the 20th century this idea had no observable consequences because <br>
nobody could find two things exactly alike. Things changed dramatically when  <br>
it was discovered that atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.  <br>
<p>
Suppose you're looking at two electrons, you may think that you can find a  <br>
difference in them, because one is here and the other one is way over there,   <br>
but can you really? How do you know the particles are not changing positions?    <br>
Would the system be any different if they did? By asking these sort of  <br>
questions and using The Identity Of Indiscernibles we can derive The Pauli <br>
Exclusion Principle, and that is the basis of the periodic table,  and that  <br>
is the basis of chemistry, and that is the basis of life. We can also <br>
discover the fact that there are two classes of particles, bosons like  <br>
photons and  fermions  like electrons.                             <br>
<p>
Experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a particle,  <br>
we can only measure the intensity of the wave function [F(x)]^2 because  <br>
that's probability and probability we can measure. P(x) =[F(x)]^2 is the  <br>
probability of finding two particles x  distance apart. Now let's exchange <br>
the  position of the particles, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x is <br>
now  x2  - x1 = -x . The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the  <br>
two particles are the same, no measurable change has been made , no change in <br>
probability , so P(x) = P(-x) . From this we see that [ F(x) ]^2 = [ F(-x)]^2  <br>
so the Quantum wave function can be an even function [ F(x) = +F(-x) ] or an  <br>
odd function  [F(x) = -F(-x) ] , remember (-1)^2 = (+1)^2 =1. <br>
<p>
Both solutions have physical significance, particles with integer spin,  <br>
bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half integer spin , fermions,  <br>
have odd wave functions. If we put two fermions like electrons in the same  <br>
place then the distance between them, x , is zero and because they must  <br>
follow the laws of odd wave functions , F(0)  = -F(0)  but the only number  <br>
that is it's own negative is zero so  F(0)  =0 . What this means is that the  <br>
wave function goes to zero and  [F(x)]^2  goes to zero , thus the probability  <br>
of finding two electrons in the same spot is zero, and that is  The Pauli <br>
Exclusion  Principle.<br>
