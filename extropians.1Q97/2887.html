I'm skeptical that that law enforcement enjoys such economies of scale.  To<br>
judge from current practices in the rather polycentric US legal system,<br>
entrepreneurs thrive at providing specialized legal systems (see, eg,<br>
labor/management relations, ISP terms-of-service contracts, AAA, etc.)  Small<br>
legal systems fit not only particular types of recurring problems (see, eg,<br>
church councils that delve into the arcana of apostasy) but also particular<br>
discrete populations that generate diverse problems (see, eg, private<br>
communities).<br>
<p>
At any rate, to the extent that law enforcement *does* enjoy economies of<br>
scale, I'd not welcome anti-trust-like metalaws to prevent the practice.<br>
 (I'm assuming consent-based jurisdiction, with freedom of entry and exit,<br>
natch.)<br>

<p>
With regard to currently recognized co-equal legal jurisdictions, we look to<br>
international law to settle such problems.  International law's customs and<br>
agreements essentially constitute default rules and contracts, respectively,<br>
for relations between sovereign legal systems.  The system does not work<br>
perfectly, of course, but it works well enough to let little States such as<br>
Andorra face off with big ones like France.  <br>
<p>
Those of you who want models of how a polycentric legal system might resolve<br>
cross-jurisdictional conflicts in general should look to international law.<br>
 As theorists in the field have often noted, international law thrives in<br>
"structural anarchy"; in other words, no one enforcement mechanism holds<br>
sway, yet countries do not continually war.<br>
