Saith McCluskey:<br>
<i>&gt;  Any competent banker would raise interest rates in response to stronger</i><br>
<i>&gt; than expected economic growth, because that indicates stronger than</i><br>
<i>&gt; expected demand for capital, usually without an equivalent increase in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the supply of capital.</i><br>
<p>
Don't know whether or not you're right, but you clearly know more about<br>
this than I do.  You're probably right; it's the supply-and-demand<br>
relationship between capital and economic growth that would determine<br>
interest rates in a free society.<br>
<p>
But there's absolutely nothing wrong with economic growth going faster<br>
and faster and faster, limited only by the amount of capital available. <br>
The Federal Reserve, by contrast, tries to limit economic growth by<br>
imposing an artificial cap, raising interest rates above what they would<br>
be in the free market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Capitalism has checks and balances which work almost perfectly in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the presence of perfect information, fail almost completely under</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions of total ignorance. We operate under conditions which</i><br>
<i>&gt; are far from those extremes.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting point.  I've often mused that government is thought<br>
necessary because people can't pay attention to everything at once.  The<br>
FDA *prohibits* foods because people can't evaluate a host of<br>
independent food-raters and ensure that each is free from corruption. <br>
To put it another way, force is used to enforce standards because<br>
enforcing them via the free market requires too much attention.<br>
<p>
Money itself is necessary because every transaction has to be a simple<br>
barter (i.e. pieces of paper for sheep), since people can't keep track<br>
of a "complex barter" or cyclic debt cancellation system.  (I.e. A-&gt;B,<br>
B-&gt;C, C-&gt;A = 0.)<br>
<p>
Once again, the key to the future is understanding how past social<br>
development has been distorted by the lack of high-speed computers.<br>
