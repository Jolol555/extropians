  The front page center column (normally odd little stories) of Friday's <br>
Wall Street Journal has a report on the cryonics industry, with particular <br>
coverage of Paul Wakfer and Dr. Olga Visser.  Mr. Wakfer is president of <br>
Cryospan and organizer of the Prometheus Project which would attempt to <br>
demonstrate revival of a central nervous system.  Dr. Visser is a South <br>
African researcher who claims to have revived a rat's heart after cooling to <br>
liquid nitrogen temperatures in a secret preservative solution.<br>
<p>
  The Journal reports that Dr. Visser's work is going to be examined and <br>
possibly replicated by her at this weekend's Alcor festival in Arizona.<br>
<p>
  The company Biotime (BTIM, NASDAQ small cap stocks) in Berkeley, <br>
California,  is said to be "getting back" a "decent percentage" of the <br>
hamsters that it plunges into a freezing bath and reheats.  [Remember that <br>
hamsters have a stong hibernation reflex, while humans have only a limited <br>
hibernation capacity, in cold water for instance.]  Biotime is testing a <br>
proprietaty solution to dilute blood in surgery, organ preservation, and <br>
other human applications.<br>
<p>
  The general tone of the article is skeptical but factually accurate, in my <br>
opinion.<br>
