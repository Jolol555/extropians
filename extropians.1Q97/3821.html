Greetings!  If you're receiving this, you probably asked to hear more about<br>
Extropian perspectives, and the activities of Extropy Institute (ExI).<br>
<p>
Extropians seek to use technology (broadly understood to include psychology <br>
and philosophy) intelligently to overcome genetic, biological, <br>
psychological, cultural, and neurological limits to the pursuit<br>
of life, liberty, and boundless achievement.<br>
<p>
Here is information on ExI's activities, on EXTROPY -- the premier, <br>
intelligent futurist publication, EXPONENT -- our members' newsletter,<br>
on the EXTRO conferences, and on other activities, such as<br>
local discussions and events.<br>
<p>
If you're already sure you're interested, see the end of this message for <br>
a membership form.<br>
<p>
<p>
                       Upward and Outward!<br>

                   13428 Maxella Avenue, #273<br>

<p>
<p>
     Extropy = the extent of a system’s intelligence, information, order,<br>
vitality, diversity,<br>
     opportunity, and capacity for growth.<br>
<p>
<p>
E X T R O P Y  I N S T I T U T E<br>
<p>
Extropy Institute (ExI) encourages the development and use of emerging<br>
and future technologies to overcome historically unchallenged limits to<br>
full human flourishing. ExI functions as a networking organization,<br>
bringing together the most creative, forward-thinking intellects<br>
from numerous fields of endeavor in working to overcome traditional,<br>
genetic, biological, and neurological. By providing forums and information<br>
the Institute facilitates discussion and organization of ideas, research,<br>
and projects involving using technology to extend life, augment <br>
intelligence, improve rational thinking, finetune psychology, move <br>
off-planet, develop artificial intelligence, and other goals.<br>
<p>
Extropy Institute is open to all who share our goals, not just professional<br>
scientists, technologists, philosophers, and artists.<br>
<p>
Since 1988, when Extropy first appeared, extropian ideas have attracted<br>
those wanting to continually improve their capabilities, those who are<br>
bold enough to challenge entrenched dogmas concerning the inevitability<br>
of death, of centralized, coercive governance, and of fixed limits to<br>
human achievement and ability. Our evolving synthesis of ideas<br>
continues to welcome fresh input.<br>
 <br>
Extropy Institute is building a culture favoring physical and intellectual<br>
augmentation, radical life extension, and a free and responsible society<br>
(here, in cyberspace, or off-Earth). We are a network of thinkers and<br>
doers who seek to question today's dogmas, shape an open-ended future,<br>
and create "transhuman" lifestyles, technologies, and institutions. Extropy<br>
Institute members are in the best position to benefit from the information<br>
and tools developed in the extropic network.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
                               E X T R O P Y<br>
<p>
Now moving to the Web, Extropy is a magazine covering the full range of<br>
advanced, emerging, and future technologies with an emphasis on making<br>
you more informed, powerful, and prepared. Some of the technologies and <br>
issues covered in EXTROPY:<br>
<p>
*    Life extension treatments, nutritional supplements, the latest <br>
      anti-aging drugs, and new programs for monitoring and combating aging.<br>
*    Developments in computers and the Internet. Software tools for self-<br>
     management. Getting ready for future advances in computers and human-<br>
     computer interaction and integration.<br>
*    How to augment your intelligence through nutrients, new smart drugs, <br>
     and cognitive techniques, and where to go for more information.<br>
*    Which technologies and industries will take off, providing excellent<br>
     opportunities for investment and employment.<br>
*    How to modify your mood and motivation with incredible new drugs, and<br>
     with rational thinking techniques.<br>
*    How can we think rationally about the proper use of new technologies to<br>
     overcome human limits? Where does traditional thinking about radical<br>
     technologies go wrong?<br>
*    How can we move beyond centralized, bureaucratic government? How can<br>
     free markets and voluntary associations take over the useful <br>
     functions of government? How can spontaneous order enable us to handle<br>
     accelerating change?<br>
*    How you can use encryption technology to protect and improve your<br>
     privacy.<br>
*    Plus: Nanotechnology and molecular computers; artificial wombs and new<br>
     methods of parenting; transhumanist philosophy to make sense of rapid <br>
     change; prosexual drugs and nutrients; how to abolish income tax; <br>
     critical thinking about environmental and resource issues; electronic <br>
     money and competing currencies; machine intelligence and artificial <br>
     life; experimental communities.<br>
<p>
The new TECH ADVANCES section will help you stay ahead of the pack with<br>
information on crucial technological developments, including: life <br>
extension techniques; intelligence increase tools; computer technology and <br>
trends; biotech advances; technology-oriented investment opportunities;<br>
practical optimism; rational values; living free of state control, and <br>
much more.<br>
<p>
Learn about the limit-busting individuals creating the future with Extropy<br>
interviews and Profiles of future-makers in diverse fields.<br>
<p>
Since 1988, Extropy has evolved as a unique forum for intriguing and<br>
inspiring explorations of advanced and future technologies, focusing on<br>
their potential for overcoming present human limits, enabling us to create<br>
a posthuman future. If you're tired of shallow, trendy, or uncritical<br>
thinking on the technological frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle,<br>
and stimulate you. <br>

    "I love it. Extropy excites the hell out of my mind." ZL, 1/93<br>
 <br>
    "It's an absolutely great issue, and in general I would call it the <br>
    best periodical I have ever seen in my life..." AC, 8/92<br>
 <br>
    "I just wanted to let you know that Extropy keeps getting better &amp;<br>
    better! (as, of course, it must in order to be so named). What a<br>
    uniformly excellent, eclectic, thoughtful, well-written selection of<br>
    articles. By far the most thought-provoking, ground-breaking stuff in<br>
    any magazine I read."  [PG, 7/94]<br>
 <br>

    hackers (and far beyond the pretentious incarnation of Mondo 2000)... An<br>
    awesome glimpse of a better future."<br>
