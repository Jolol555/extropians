&lt;&lt; The point was that this is a poster that will be seen by many people,<br>
making<br>
 the extropian concepts, and related concepts (nanotech especially) look like<br>
 scifi. This doesn't help the scientific world's impression of these<br>
 technologies. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Gee, your so protective of us, thanks! But no thanks.<br>
Look, we are talking about an image here. <br>
<p>
Extropic Art will be judged as Extropic Art. <br>
It will not be judged as science, or Extropic philosophy or as Extropic<br>
technology. <br>
People will look to the scientist, nanotechnologists and philosophers to do<br>
their job, which may be quite artful in it's OWN right.. <br>
ART. Poignant, evocative, prevocative, ART. <br>
<p>
Sci fi is also taken as art, a genre that provokes and stimulates, and is<br>
good in itself.<br>
Sometimes it's actually helpful in congealing ideas! As Aegis said we can all<br>
benefit from constructive helpful ideas for our art, not put downs or rude<br>
pessimistic comments.<br>
<p>
I think people can tell the difference between something created out of<br>
beauty and grace, and the true progresses of science, technology  and<br>
biomedicine....people have that much sense.<br>
<p>
This reflects more about your own obvious lack of understanding of Extropian<br>
concepts (as your dogma,  pessimism and rantings about the future show) Next<br>
time,  perhaps try and contribute rather than flail away in anger or sadness<br>
or whatever emotional conflicts this future (and IMO very tender sounding )<br>
piece of art brings up in you...<br>
