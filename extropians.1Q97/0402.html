I'm not sure about there being no "complexification drive".  Brain sizes have<br>
increased markedly over time, and land animals with the intelligence of most<br>
dinosaurs probably wouldn't be viable today.  Certainly there aren't any.<br>
<p>
Modern plants have phenomenally intricate genetic systems (far more so than<br>
any animal) and presumably this is their compensation for having to do<br>
without behavior.  I'm not aware of any analysis of the genetic complexity of<br>
ancient plants, and indeed such a thing would be very hard to do.  There may<br>
well be another "complexification drive" going on we can't track.<br>
