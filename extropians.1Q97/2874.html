<p>
You referred to a theory that, within the context of a negotiation,<br>
people will be more "entrenched" regarding big issues that little<br>
issues.   Applied to politics, this might explain more confidence on<br>
big issues relative to little issues, as long as those different<br>
issues might appear in the same negotiation.  But if we compare<br>
confidence regarding politics to confidence regarding phychotherapy,<br>
where there is no common negotiation covering both areas, this theory<br>
doesn't apply.  <br>
