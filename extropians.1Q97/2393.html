Your previous assertion that old growth is being used for furniture is<br>
wrong. Furniture that is solid wood, not vernier, is of such high value<br>
that it must be 1) of hardwood (not a typical characteristic of old<br>
growth) and 2) have beautifully luminescent grain, i.e. that which has<br>
burl, or curly grain. Old growth has very straight grain wood, and is<br>
useless for furniture, with the exception of rosewood and other exotics<br>
from equatorial rain forests. Old growth is good for large wood beams,<br>
and for pulping into paper. Granted that some paper companies, like<br>
Weyerhauser, are experimenting with fast growth pine and cottonwood<br>
hybrids, but such farms are plagued by problems with soil retention, so<br>
any given ground is worthless after two or three generations of such<br>
fast growth trees (6-15 years total). Such agriculture is the exception,<br>
not the rule. The fact that a lumber company does not have to put in the<br>
investment in planting, thinning, and pruning old growth like it does<br>
with its highly sensitive hybrids, makes old growth more cost effective<br>
to harverst than agricultural wood.<br>
<p>
Another factor that has speeded the harvesting of old growth here in the<br>
US and Canada in the last 8 years is the fall of the USSR. No kdding.<br>
With the opening of the Siberian wilderness to western lumber<br>
exploitation, US companies, especially those who had significant<br>
investments in purchasing old growth land outright, had to harvest that<br>
wood as soon as possible before cheap lumber from Siberia got onto the<br>
open market. So they helped engineer the US Gov't restriction of<br>
harvesting off USG land (you don't seriously think they'd roll over so<br>
easily for a damn owl, do you?), to help boost the price enough to<br>
offset the flood of private old growth on the market. The USG loved it,<br>
because then they could look like they were doing good for the<br>
environment (only the environment on their land), while also setting up<br>
a future high value market for Russian lumber, that would help pay off<br>
their buddies in Moscow enough to go along with arms reductions, etc etc<br>
etc....<br>
