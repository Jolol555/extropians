Michael Lorrey posted a piece taken from HotWired with the libertarian saying <br>
he was against large corporations.  He said "You even reject the idea that a <br>
corporation is an authoritarian system of organized economic power.... a <br>
diseased market economy in which a handful of megacorporations grow like a <br>
spreading cancer sucking the life from people and nature. Is the disease <br>
running out of control? You bet it is. And the patient is dying."<br>
<p>
The main flaw with the idea that authoritarian megacorporations are going to <br>
take over the world is the belief that running a business as a monolithic, <br>
authoritarian system is an efficient way of doing business compared to other <br>
ways.  Smaller companies are far more efficient; they are more flexible and <br>
becaues they aren't huge, they can't afford to waste their money on <br>
inefficient ways of doing things.  Advanced information technologies are <br>
making it possible for very small companies to compete with the <br>
megacorporations, where they can offer goods and services at a lower price <br>
than the megacorporations, since they are fundamentally more efficient.<br>
<p>
Until fairly recently, very large organizations have been more successful than <br>
the alternatives that were available, but that is changing now that more <br>
successful alternatives for organizations are appearing.  What we're seeing <br>
now is a lot of very successful small companies springing up all over the <br>
place, competing with the Big Boys.  They generally use a lot of information <br>
technology and contract out lots of their work to other companies, such as <br>
shipping companies, answering services, printing companies, etc., while they <br>
each focus on what they're good at.  The information technologies that are <br>
developing are making it increasingly easier for a small company to contact <br>
and do business with other small companies and to insure that their efforts <br>
are coordinated.  Since each small group of people is responsible for their <br>
own company and will not get enough business if they do not perform well <br>
enough, only the really competent companies will remain in business.  In a <br>
megacorporation, if one department does badly, they are usually subsidized by <br>
the corporation as a whole, and thus they hurt the entire corporation, and <br>
there is not as much immediate accountability for the actions of the people <br>
responsible for poor performance.<br>
<p>
What I believe we're going to see is lots more small business springing up all <br>
over the place, becoming very successful, and the huge, monolithic <br>
megacorporations are going to have to adapt quite radically to even stay in <br>
business.  They're going to have to dismantle their companies and start <br>
contracting out nearly all of their work to smaller companies.  That way, if <br>
their printing department sucks, they just switch to a new printing <br>
department, just like all the small companies do.  This ability to hire and <br>
fire 'employees' so quickly is mainly what gives small companies such <br>
flexibility and efficiency.  If the people at Kinko's don't do a good job for <br>
Bob's Computer Shack, well then Bob will stop using them and use some other <br>
printing service, essentially firing a whole team of employees and hiring a <br>
whole new one, with no expenses for training.  What a deal!<br>
<p>
The era of Huge Organizations is nearly over.  I don't see how they can last <br>
with all the little guys scurrying around, snatching up business opportunities <br>
all over the place, starving the Big Boys.  Because they are more effiecient, <br>
small companies will have lower prices than huge ones, and they will attract <br>
more business.  I predict the dissolution of huge companies and countries <br>
within ten to twenty years.  From what I'm aware of, this is the most likely <br>
course of  action humans will take.  We shall see.<br>
