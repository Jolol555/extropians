On Sunday, March 16, 1997 5:55 AM, Reilly Jones wrote:<br>
&lt;Radical skepticism is indistinguishable from nihilism.<br>
 [SNIP - Kimball/Stove: "a form of irrationalism whose philosophical <br>
roots go back to Hume."]<br>
I can't begin to count how many posts have been devoted to quibbling <br>
over 'certainty' on this list. I hope certain individuals are taking <br>
this critique to heart ;) &gt;<br>
<p>
Well, I can 'count' and I last recall *this* specific topic <br>
(certainty) coming up at the end of last Sep when Reilly had just <br>
finished citing a review of Windshuttle in the Sep96 _The New <br>
Criterion_ in another effort to extricate *us* from the "swamp of <br>
post-modern literary theory" and lead us across "the desert of Michael <br>
Focault's 'anti-humanism'". (Hmmm, folks were just discussing Focault <br>
here last week...)<br>
<p>
At that time I wrote:<br>
&lt;certainty is a subjective feeling, not an objective truth. I'm also <br>
certain that we can never be completely certain about most *things*, <br>
as opposed to *feelings*.... I agree that the most important thing is, <br>
as you [Jeff Dee] say, to be always questioning, trying to reduce <br>
uncertainty.&gt;<br>
<p>
Some time after that I first read Jean Baudrillard's "Radical Thought" <br>
essay, the essence of which is the "radical skepticism", the "smug <br>
nihilism" that Reilly notes. Yet, I was also struck by how easily an <br>
extropic *approach* could be extracted, if one ignored the smugness <br>
and pessimism, the disdain for truth, the desire for the Void, for <br>
what I like to call "Jim Legg's free-for-all soup". Baudrillard says:<br>
&lt;The requirement of this thought ['radical thought'] is double and <br>
contradictory. It does not consist in analyzing the<br>
world to extract from it an improbable truth. It does not adapt itself <br>
dialectically to the facts and abstract from them some logical <br>
construction. It is much more subtle than that, and more perverse as <br>
well. This thought consists in putting into place a form, a matrix of <br>
illusion and disillusion, a strange attracting force, so that a <br>
seduced reality will be able to spontaneously feed on it.&gt;<br>
<p>
Don't misinterpret me: Baudrillard seeks dissolution because he thinks <br>
this is an awful world, while I, as an Extropian, would seek coherence <br>
- drawing out the truth and beauty from amidst the overwhelming noise <br>
and decay.  But, is this not also a seduction of reality?<br>
<p>
Then, Reilly says induction and deduction "don't mix well". My point <br>
is this: I, too, tend to favor empirical approaches and reliance on <br>
the coherence of our perceptual capabilities for establishing <br>
objective truth; but, to make the "extropic transformation", well, as <br>
Reilly puts it in his "A History of Extropic Thought" essay:<br>
&lt;Our conceptual capabilities go far beyond our perceptual <br>
capabilities. They do not merely categorize our immediate sensory <br>
stimulation, they categorize very general and abstract relations <br>
transcending temporality.... Our maps are always incomplete, but there <br>
is no limit to creative interpretations on them.&gt;<br>
<p>
I see these "creative interpretations" as deductions - I want it to be <br>
so, even though it is not yet so (or my interpretation is incomplete), <br>
so I will do my best to make it so! (Conclusions following from <br>
premises / results following from desires, rather than inductions / <br>
reasoning from current particulars to say that this is the way it must <br>
be.) If the particulars 'suck', and for many they do, then the <br>
seductive deduction is to reach beyond, to climb out of the asymptotes <br>
one finds oneself in, striving toward the top of the curve...<br>
<p>
Reilly cites Kimball/Stove saying:<br>
&lt;Popper stood this all on its head. In his philosophy of science, we <br>
find the curious thought that falsifiability, not verifiability, is <br>
the distinguishing mark of scientific theories ...&gt;<br>
<p>
Now, I have not read Popper.  About all I knew about Popper prior to <br>
this was his notions of Worlds 1-3.  Until now I had associated these <br>
with Reilly's more elegant notions of ordered, chaotic and liquid <br>
realms. (Gee, now I'm so uncertain (-;)<br>
<p>
I too prefer truth / verity rather doubt, problems and refutations; <br>
but, as Reilly has said in his "Extropic Thought" essay, "dualism is <br>
philosophy's perennial cop-out". And, a few paragraphs later in that <br>
same essay Reilly says: "Concepts are pruned to our desire for truth <br>
through methods of falsifiability or verifiability." I notice he says <br>
"or", not "and".<br>
<p>
*But, BOTH are useful tools in the proper context: I would emphasize <br>
what has been verified when setting forth known history, or truth, <br>
from the past, but I would defer to what can be falsified when <br>
speculating about new possibilities for the future.*<br>
<p>
Kimball/Stove spites the "irrationalism whose philosophical roots go <br>
back to Hume." Yet, in Reilly's Extropic Thought essay he notes "David <br>
Hume ... echoes the Taoist saying of 'the farther you go the less you <br>
know.'" Reilly contends that the farther we go, the *more* we know. <br>
While this is true, it is also true that the more we know, the more we <br>
realize how much more there is still to be learned. Acknowledging this <br>
does not mean one has sunk into irrationalism! Consider Reilly's <br>
ending quote from Miguel de Unamuno on his "Nozick's 'Non Coercive' <br>
Autism" post:<br>
&lt;"The will, the will not ever to die, the refusal to resign oneself to <br>
death, ceaselessly builds the house of life while the keen blasts and <br>
icy winds of reason unceasingly batter at the structure and beat it <br>
down."&gt;<br>
<p>
Am I to conclude from this that reason is inimicable to life? I think <br>
not - that would be a dualistic copout. Rather, BOTH will AND reason, <br>
empirical induction and conceptual deduction, will compete to make the <br>
extropic transformation. Which we *emphasize* does not depend on <br>
truth, but on perspective or, dare I say it, utility.<br>
<p>
Also from Reilly's "A History of Extropic Thought" essay:<br>
&lt;We acquire knowledge by directing our internal searchlight at the <br>
metaphysical unknown in search of something we can call a problem to <br>
work on. As our searchlight sweeps the metaphysical night sky, we map <br>
what reveals itself in the beam and interpret the map according to our <br>
utility of the moment.&gt;<br>
<p>
Is this not similar to the functionalism (or was it utilitarianism) <br>
that you were criticizing Gregory Houston for a month ago? Is this <br>
"inventing purposes" or "pursuing truth", and how can you so certainly <br>
draw this fine line for someone other than yourself?<br>
