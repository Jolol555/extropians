    One thing I recall from my anthropology classes, is that in<br>
pre-industrial cultures whose primary food source is cultivation of<br>
rice in paddies -- which includes a lot of east and southeast Asia, as<br>
well as nearby islands -- more children are highly desirable, because<br>
even an eight-year-old is a net economic *benefit* to the family: Rice<br>
production depends on dexterity rather than on physical strength, and<br>
a child of eight is efficient enough in the paddies to produce more<br>
than he or she eats.  That information was alleged to go a long way to<br>
explaining high population growth in that part of the world; if so, it<br>
is an interesting variant on the "commons" problem, because clearly<br>
(in pre-industrial cultures, at any rate), land is also a limiting<br>
resource on food production.<br>
<p>
    Another interesting correlate of family values with economy<br>
occurred in areas where most agricultural production involved plows<br>
drawn by draft animals.  Operating such a plow is back-breaking labor,<br>
requiring great physical strength.  Perhaps consequently, cultures<br>
heavily dependent on such production tend to value sons much more than<br>
daughters, even to the extent of either killing unwanted daughters, or<br>
allowing them to die from malnutrition or mistreatment.<br>
<p>
    I wonder whether any consequences of these behaviors have made it<br>
into the genetic pool.<br>
