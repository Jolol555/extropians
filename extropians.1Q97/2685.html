<i>&gt; I haven't read Coase's original work, just Friedman's essay on his web</i><br>
<i>&gt; page.  The latter didn't seem to show that all gov't solutions were</i><br>
<i>&gt; unnecessary, just that exercising them would take more analysis and</i><br>
<i>&gt; consideration.  LA auto pollution?  Widespread atmospheric pollution?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ocean overfishing?  Coase seemed to push the problem to one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; transaction costs; what if for a few problems coercive solutions are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; best practical solution?</i><br>
<p>
"Practical" is a value judgment, and presupposes a standard by which<br>
one must judge what works "well" and what doesn't.  If one's standard<br>
of judgment includes the total repudiation of coercive force, as does<br>
mine, then no coercive solution can be practical by definition.  It<br>
may be difficult to create free-market solutions to some problems, but<br>
I have never found such a problem.  The ones you name above are quite<br>
trivially solved by assigning private property rights in clean air and<br>
healthy oceans to individuals, and letting the market trade itself<br>
into equilibrium; basic A-C 101.<br>
<p>
Again, I place the burden of proof where it belongs: on the agents of<br>
force.  I do not care to prove to you that I am free--you must prove<br>
to me that to enslave me is justified.  Resorting to history is no<br>
excuse.  That only proves that slavery is natural and compatible with<br>
our evolutionary design.  I thumb my nose at that nature; I know I can<br>
do better, and I assume that others can as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One item is that peaceful voluntary disgovernance involves something like </i><br>
<i>&gt; forcing Congress to disband.  It might be easier to force a replacement</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Congress with a random government, and then to convince those</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislators to disband, as they would have less personal stake in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; power.</i><br>
<p>
The "steps along the way" argument is not without merit, and I am<br>
sympathetic to libertarians who, for instance, advocate a flat tax or<br>
school vouchers as intermediate steps in the direction of abolishing<br>
taxation and state indoctrination.  I voted for vouchers myself.  But<br>
there is a fine line between manipulating a system that exists in<br>
order to dismantle it later, and buying into the system's fundamental<br>
claim of power and then merely tweaking it.  I think a far better<br>
path is to manipulate the system to the point at which it no longer<br>
is able to interfere with the lives of individual sovereigns trading<br>
among themselves, and then simply ignore it and let it die of its<br>
own weight.  I call that "underthrowing" the government.   All these<br>
ideas like "random democracy" or "hyperdemocracy" start from the<br>
premise that democracy itself is somehow moral, and neither serve<br>
to undermine the power of the system, only to move it around like<br>
shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic.  Democracy doesn't need to be<br>
fixed, it needs to be crippled and then abandoned.<br>
