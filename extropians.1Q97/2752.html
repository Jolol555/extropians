<i>&gt; BTW, can someone help me with an anarcho-capitalism question? I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely understand how PPL/PPAs operate; I can see that for conflicts</i><br>
<i>&gt; between different PPLs the protection agencies have to go to some kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of independent court for arbitration, but what happens for disputes</i><br>
<i>&gt; purely between customers of one protection agency? I always assumed that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the agency would settle it themselves, but from rereading 'Machinery of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Freedom' over Christmas Friedman seems to imply that they would still</i><br>
<i>&gt; go to an external court.</i><br>
<p>
Your contract with the agency should specify that.  If they want to<br>
use their own court facilities, they certainly can, but it probably<br>
makes more sense to use the same independent courts that resolve<br>
inter-agency disputes to resolve intra-agency ones as well, simply<br>
because they are already equipped for it an experienced at it.  Also,<br>
it separates the interests of the enforcer and the arbitrator, which<br>
is probably a good thing.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Finally, how are PPAs supposed to recognize their customers? Do we all</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to wear big luminous jackets with their logos on or something? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can see how to do it in a more advanced society (e.g. everyone has</i><br>
<i>&gt; implanted computers and radio-networking), but I'm not sure how we could</i><br>
<i>&gt; do it with current technology.</i><br>
<p>
Only a criminal needs to know that.  So long as you follow the rules of<br>
your own agency, it has to protect you.  If there were some oddball group<br>
who wanted to prosecute people who said some word to them, your agency<br>
would negotiate with theirs either to exempt its members, add that rule<br>
for its members, or some compromise.  In any case, that would become part<br>
or your agency's rules, and they would spell out what rules you had to<br>
follow to make their job of protecting you easier (or else charge you<br>
more to amortize the chance of your accidental violations).<br>
