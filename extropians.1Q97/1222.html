<i>&gt; I don't think it did, i.e., brains stayed much the same for a million</i><br>
<i>&gt; years or more after Lucy (I think).</i><br>
<p>
  Later _Australopithecus_ species had larger brains.  I am not<br>
sure we have enough data to say anything about brain-size trends<br>
in _A_afarensis_.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are some *real* problems in growing larger brains, ask any</i><br>
<i>&gt; woman who has had a baby.</i><br>
<p>
  Indeed!  At birth, the head of a human infant is in essence an<br>
interference fit in the birth canal -- which is not true for any<br>
mammal outside the hominid line.  Childbirth is sort of a *yawn*<br>
experience in most other mammals, most often resembling what happens<br>
when you squeeze a watermellon seed between thumb and forefinger.  The<br>
price that humans pay for it seems to indicate that our large brain<br>
has high survival value.<br>
  I have heard it seriously suggested that one almost universal<br>
characteristic of the hominid line is "obligate midwivery"; survival<br>
of mother and child at birth is made far more likely by the presence<br>
of competent adult assistance.  Not that women cannot give birth<br>
unassisted, just that it is vastly more likely that their genes will<br>
be removed from the pool if they try.  Thus one can make a parallel<br>
case -- I don't say a completely convincing one -- that we are<br>
obligate social beings, who require (in the sense of natural<br>
selection) a cooperative society at least as large as an extended<br>
family or perhaps a small band.  (Hmn, that line of reasoning might<br>
not be popular among extropians, but what's a squirrel for if not to<br>
chatter obnoxiously and hurl nuts...)<br>
  Odd bit of whimsy, that the "oldest profession" may have been<br>
"midwife".<br>
  (And incidentally, the use of the specific term, "midwife", was not<br>
intended to suggest anything about midwife gender.)<br>
                       <br>
<i>&gt; I don't have a pointer, but I remember that one chimp was taught to</i><br>
<i>&gt; chip rock--or at least fracture them to get a sharp edge.  I suspect</i><br>
<i>&gt; that our hands are not that advanced over a chimp's.</i><br>
<p>
  Our hands can take what is known as a "precision grip" -- the way<br>
most people hold a screwdriver -- as well as a "power grip" -- the way<br>
most people hold a hammer.  The former is much rarer among creatures<br>
with hands, than the latter.  I believe I recall that Chimpanzees have<br>
the latter, but not the former.<br>
  At least one Chimpanzee has indeed been taught to fracture rocks to<br>
get a sharp edge, and has found use for said edges in his habitat.<br>
Chimp use of shaped stone in the wild has been reported, though not in<br>
quite the sense that most people would immediately take it --<br>
somewhere in Africa there is a flat rock that has been used by Chimps<br>
as an anvil for cracking nuts, for long enough to have been deformed<br>
by repeated blows of (I think) the hammer stone.  It is in effect a<br>
"Chimpanzee midden", by analogy with California Indian sites where<br>
stone has similarly been deformed into mortar-like depressions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree with that, I just have my doubts that a pre-human throwing a rock  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would even be a good bluff, and as a offensive hunting weapon I think it </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would be hopeless. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It might be more useful for that in the early stages, but after a while of</i><br>
<i>&gt; using rocks/sticks to fend off preditors, some genious of Lucy's clan </i><br>
<i>&gt; would use it to obtain lunch.  After that . . . . </i><br>
<p>
  I believe I remember that object-hurling by other primates has been<br>
observed to serve as a predator deterrant in the wild, and also occurs<br>
as part of various kinds of intra-species display.  Indeed, though, once<br>
developed for any purpose, it might find others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In fact, it has just occured to me that an animal who ventured out on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; flats, even to scavenge, would no longer have the option of going up a tree</i><br>
<i>&gt; to avoid preditors.</i><br>
<p>
  Yes.<br>
