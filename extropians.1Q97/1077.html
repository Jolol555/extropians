<i>&gt;successful at communicating what that is.  I don't know what emotion</i><br>

<i>&gt;are consistent with what other people describe as emotion, I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;identify some of those things as distinct from my referent for reason,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which I will try to describe here briefly (in somewhat abbreviated</i><br>
<i>&gt;form): I have a specific referent for "knowledge", and for "reality",</i><br>
<i>&gt;and for what it means for the former to be consistent with the latter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I use the word "reason" to mean "those principles and methods--which</i><br>
<i>&gt;may change over time--that lead to the acquisition of knowledge that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is consistent with reality." </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but *which* principles and methods *are* those? The definition<br>
you offer denotes nothing specific. The fact of the matter is that<br>
"reason" is an ill-understood product of cultural evolution: a<br>
motley assortment of assumptions, procedures, communications<br>
techniques, specific methods of criticism, formal systems, etc. We<br>
all have a vague agreement about what sort of principles and methods<br>
are reasonable and which are not, but even here our agreement is<br>
context-dependent.  There are principles and methods which are<br>
completely reasonable in one field of inquiry and completely<br>
unreasonable in another.  For the time being, reason itself is a<br>
tradition, with all the warts and bumps that rational people have<br>
learned to expect in traditions. Karl Popper and William Bartley<br>
have done an excellent job explaining what rationality is as well<br>
as what distinguishes it from competing traditions, but for the<br>
time being "reason" has no more of a precise referent than does<br>
"God" or "emotion".<br>
<p>
The point I am trying to make is that given the current state of<br>
cognitive science, the word "reason" might very well turn out to be as<br>
free of content as "caloric" or "phlogiston". This doesn't bother me,<br>
but given the way you talk, it seems to me that it should bother you.<br>
Reason is a culturally-evolved component of our total cognitive toolkit.<br>
I happen to value it highly, and like you, I find my chief grounds for<br>
disappointment with my fellow human beings in their reluctance to use<br>
and develop their reason. But I don't think that making an idol of<br>
Reason is going to solve anyone's problems. And I certainly don't think<br>
that using this idol to verbally drub other people about the head and<br>
shoulders is going to increase the quality of information flowing<br>
through this list, which is *my* selfish interest in the matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I will also freely admit that I have some emotional attachment to</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific principles and methods like formal logic and experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have not found anything better yet.  I am underwhelmed by those</i><br>
<i>&gt;alternatives--including the alternatives some have suggested here</i><br>
<i>&gt;of combining or balancing them with others--which I have seen.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspect I will never find better alternatives, but I cannot rule it</i><br>
<i>&gt;out entirely.</i><br>
<p>
Now you are making it clear that the value you place on Reason is<br>
grounded in your own knowledge. Perhaps now it will be easier for<br>
you to understand that the value others place on "balance" or<br>
"feeling" is grounded in knowledge and experience of their own<br>
that they can no more produce for you on demand than you can produce<br>
an accurate, precise, and denotative definition of "reason".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(1) Please provide a sample of my text where I "rant against passion."</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've done no such thing, I merely point out that it is often used for</i><br>
<i>&gt;purposes ill-suited to it, namely cognition.  If I pointed out that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;screwdriver drove screws better than a hammer, would you call that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rant against hammers?  That I was some robotic screwdriver-worshipping</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-hammerist?</i><br>
<p>
When I use funny *punctuation* (you tend to use the /slashes/) to<br>
emphasize words in statements I make having to do with vague and poorly<br>
understood abstractions such as "passion" and "cognition", because I am<br>
making definite statements intended to modify other people's behavior, I<br>
call that ranting. If you had been ranting about screwdrivers and<br>
hammers instead of passion and cognition, that would not have been a<br>
rant: that would have been a joke, a parody of a rant.<br>
<p>
My ulterior motive in accusing you of ranting against passion was to<br>
strike a nerve, because I've been annoyed by your repeated insistence<br>
that words cannot hurt people. This is an attitude that I would *expect*<br>
to find only among those who are accustomed to using physical force to<br>
hurt people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(2) Yes, I am passionate about reason, and I recognize that.  It works</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyway.</i><br>
<p>
So there is a possibility that your values are grounded in your<br>
passions, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(3) If you search for messages from me with "Rand" in them, you will</i><br>
<i>&gt;find them generally critical, so I'm not sure why you see me as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;puppet to her mind, just because we happen to reach many of the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusions and share many ideas.  I do admire her genius, but I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;quite capable of also seeing her mistakes and using my own mind.</i><br>
<p>
I'm glad to hear it. I too feel admiration and gratitude toward Rand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And yes, I recognize that that last sentence shows that I allowed</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional reactions ("motivation", "anticipation") to materially</i><br>
<i>&gt;affect my reasoning process ("spend more mental energy on this").</i><br>
<i>&gt;I recognize that fact by reason.</i><br>
<p>
Well, no. You recognize that fact with your brain. Reason is just<br>
a part of your brain, and it's difficult to tell at this stage of<br>
things whether *all* the parts of your brain you used to recognize<br>
that fact fall under the rubric of "reason".<br>
<p>
(I'm also quite curious as to what you mean to refer to by the phrase<br>
"mental energy", but this would probably be muddying the issue.)<br>
