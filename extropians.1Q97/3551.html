 "This has enormous potential for good, There should be no limits on human  <br>
  knowledge, none whatever. To those like President Clinton who say we can't   <br>
  play God, I say OK, fine, you can take your side alongside Pope Paul V who <br>
  in 1616 tried to stop Galileo, they accused Galileo of trying to play God <br>
  too. [...] I don't think cloning is demeaning to human nature, to attempt   <br>
  to limit human knowledge is demeaning. It's not legitimate to try to stop  <br>
  cloning. What nonsense, what utter, utter nonsense to think we can hold   <br>
  up our hand and just say "stop". Cloning will continue, the human mind will  <br>
  continue to inquire into it. Human cloning will take place and it will take <br>
  place in my lifetime, and I don't fear it at all. I want to be on the side  <br>
  of the Galileos and those who say the human mind has no limits, rather than  <br>
  trying to stop something that's going to happen anyway."<br>

--US Senator Tom Harkin, (D) IA<br>

KGO radio replayed part of that speech in the news tonight.  Until now, I<br>
was beginning to despair that libertarian voices on this issue would be<br>
drowned in the flood of anti-tech I'd been hearing.  But the facts not<br>
only that he said it, but that it got airplay, encourage me.  Among the<br>
rarest events humans may occasionally witness, like solar eclipses and<br>
bright comets, you may include hearing me praise a Democrat: your cousin<br>
done good today, John.  Of course tomorrow he'll want me to pay for the<br>
reasearch, but hey, the quote will always be a good one.<br>
