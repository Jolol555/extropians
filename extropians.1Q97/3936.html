Damien,<br>
<p>
My comment was directed at Squirrel, who seems to me to agree that there<br>
is a connection between libertarianism and transhumanism, but thinks a<br>
good strategy for spreading transhumanism is to keep quite about<br>
libertainism.  I just thought that was a cowardly approach.  He thinks<br>
it's subtle.  There it stands.<br>
<p>
I had no intention of directing that comment at people like yourself who<br>
sympathise with transhumanism but doubt that there is a connection<br>
between transhumanism and libertarianism.  That's your opinion.  I think<br>
you're wrong, and we could argue about it; but I don't hold your opinion<br>
in contempt.<br>
<p>
I would say it's quite vital for variations on the transhumanist theme<br>
to come together in this forum and criticise each others' ideas.  That's<br>
a libertarian commitment on my part.<br>
