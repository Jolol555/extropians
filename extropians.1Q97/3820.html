<i>&gt;Here's a better one.  Consider a binary star, two stars bound by gravity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the plane of their mutual orbit, and rotating with them, J.L.Lagrange</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1772) identified five points where the balance of forces is such that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;small mass can stay put.  Three of these points, on the line through the</i><br>
<i>&gt;stars, are unstable: if the satellite is nudged along the line it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;accelerate away from the Lagrange point.  But two (L4 and L5), each</i><br>
<i>&gt;forming an equilateral triangle with the stars, are attractors --</i><br>
<i>&gt;virtual masses (though their gravity fields are far from symmetrical).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Satellites can orbit these points.  The attractors are informally</i><br>
<i>&gt;called trojan points, because most of the asteroids around the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sun-Jupiter triangle points happen to be named from the Iliad.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Trojan companions have also been found for Saturn's big moons.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You seem to be suggesting that the market obeys not only the wishes of</i><br>
<i>&gt;human buyers/sellers (the true masses) but also fluke phenomena, phantom</i><br>
<i>&gt;bidders, analogous to the trojan points.  I thank you for planting that</i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting thought.  But because the market is far more complex and</i><br>
<i>&gt;chaotic than a two-body system, I expect the "market trojan points"</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be transitory.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this *is* better!  In the last paragraph you say "human<br>
buyers/sellers," shouldn't that be corporate/human buyers/sellers?  To<br>
extend the analogy, the humans would be the interstellar dust from which a<br>
protosystem is currently forming and the corperations would be the stars;<br>
initially chatoic, the system would become more ordered with time.  The<br>
formation of the system would initially be more dependant on the<br>
distribution of 'dust,' but eventually dominated by the relative positions<br>
of the stars.  I thank *you* for the generation and presentation of this<br>
interesting thought.<br>
