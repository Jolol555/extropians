There was this programmer walking along, past a pond, when he heard =<br>
someone cry, "Help me, help me!" from the direction of the water. Upon =<br>
further investigation, he found a frog, which he picked up, put in his =<br>
pocket, and continued on his way across campus.<br>
<p>
He then heard the frog cry, "Help, Help, take mo out of your pocket, =<br>
I'me really a beautiful princess turned into a frog by a wicked witch."<br>
<p>
He took the frog out of his pocket, smiled, and put the frog back in =<br>
his pocket.<br>
<p>
"Help help, take me back out of your pocket! If you kiss me, I'll turn =<br>
back into a beutiful princess! if you rescue me I'll love you forever."<br>
<p>
The programmer took the frog out of his pocket, and said to the frog," =<br>
I'm a programmer, I don't have time for a girlfreind or wife.....but a =<br>
talking frog? Now thats COOOL!"<br>
