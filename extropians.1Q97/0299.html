This is a rather un-Austrian way of putting it. For me, at least, the <br>
most interesting thing about the economic paradigm developed by the<br>
Austrian school is that it sees the market as an information-generating<br>
process, not as a process that works well only when information is<br>
automatically supplied to it (from where?).<br>
<p>
I'm also surprised that I haven't seen mention of Selgin's THEORY OF<br>
FREE BANKING in this discussion of business cycles, since that book is<br>
the first one I know of that proposes a system of banking institutions<br>
that would allow the supply of money to respond directly to changes in<br>
demand (also called "velocity" when we are speaking of money and not of<br>
some non-monetary good). I haven't the skills to form my own judgement<br>
as to whether or not Selgin's theory is correct, but his explanation<br>
sounds plausible to me and I'd like to see it tried someday.<br>
<p>
A review of Selgin's book is available in back issues of Extropy <br>
magazine and also on the Web at<br>

(Yes, I'm tooting my own horn... but I also chose to review the book in<br>
the first place because I think it is both important and neglected.)<br>
