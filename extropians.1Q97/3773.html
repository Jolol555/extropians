RJ quoting David Stove: "...No ideal could be more destructive of human<br>
life than the ideal of non-coerciveness.  [The only way] of producing a<br>
non-coercive human being is to produce an autistic one. . . ."&gt;<br>
<p>
Tom Morrow: &lt;This sorely mischaracterizes coercion, human life, and autism.<br>
 Indeed, the reverse of what Stove claims holds more true:  Coercion<br>
destroys human life, both literally and figuratively.  Stove's criticism<br>
makes the fatal error of confounding coercion with intellectual debate.&gt;<br>
<p>
No, it is Nozick himself who utterly abandons intellectual debate in the<br>
interest of "non-coercion."  He held that it would be wrong "to get someone<br>
to believe something whether he wants to believe it or not."  This is the<br>
very opposite of intellectual debate, it is passivity of the most radical<br>
kind this side of the grave.<br>
<p>
Much of what passes for "intellectual debate" today, in any case, consists<br>
largely of coercion, in the form of massive fraud.  Fraudulent values,<br>
meanings, and facts are served up regularly throughout our society, coupled<br>
with a spiking of the truth, by our most important institutions.<br>
<p>
Tom: &lt;Autism, in the sense of folding in on oneself, follows from contact<br>
with a violent world--not a non-coercive one.&gt;<br>
<p>
Factually, autism does not follow from contact with a violent world.  A<br>
large study of autism was conducted and reported by Tina Adler in "Science<br>
News" (April 16, 1994: 248-9), "Comprehending Those Who Can't Relate."<br>
<p>
  "The study suggests that while normal people use logic to analyze risks<br>
before making decisions, their brains also give them an automatic emotional<br>
warning signal that the patients' brains fail to produce....  The patients<br>
'run purely on cognition... and if you are going to run your personal and<br>
social life on logic alone, it's not going to work....'  The... findings...<br>
suggest that.... 'withdrawn people... focus on too narrow a range of the<br>
environment, and this seems to confirm it.'  Autism reveals to scientists<br>
what happens when the underpinnings of social behavior become seriously<br>
unglued."<br>
<p>
The article goes on to discuss different manifestations of the social<br>
problems that develop when the focus of attention is too narrow, and the<br>
working memory is inefficient.  This is exactly the problem with those<br>
individuals who adopt Nozick's radically "non-coercion" philosophy of: 'I<br>
do not interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'  The<br>
premise is utterly false, but they do not comprehend this fact, because<br>
they make too literal an interpretation of it (too narrow focus of<br>
attention), and their working memory is inefficent through a wilful<br>
disregard of the "unintended consequences of life processes," which, in<br>
fact, are routinely coercive all by themselves.  The autism reveals itself<br>
as a closed and dishonest unawareness of the way an individual impinges<br>
without permission or compensation, on living entities all around them. <br>
