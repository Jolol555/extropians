I haven't seen it, although I remember spending quite a bit of time with the<br>
journalists.  Apparently the interview with extropians is presented in three<br>
separate shows, one of which covers more area than the other two shows.<br>
<p>
My recollection of the program is that the producers were very interested in<br>
extropy's ideas about the future.  My wisdom of experience sez that you<br>
never know how the interview will be interpreted or presented and in what<br>
context until it appears in print or video.  So, in this sense, it BBC did a<br>
'good thing';<br>
