<i>&gt; Subsidy, what subsidy? I've never gotten one red cent from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government. Where oh where wise master may I find these riches????</i><br>
<p>
I explained that quite clearly many times: if you sell me a product,<br>
then I use the ideas to create a similar one and sell that, then the<br>
government will step in and prevent me from doing so /at my expense/.<br>
Protecting a market at public expense is no less a subsidy than just<br>
writing checks from the public coffers or regulating prices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another falsehood. By granting the creator a monopoly on use of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular invention, a technological leapfrog effect is encouraged,</i><br>
<i>&gt; where other companies and individuals, in order to compete, must invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; the next greater refinement. Not having this system would stultify</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological advancement as everyone would produce the same technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and competition would be quashed, productivity would stagnate, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy would be swamped by overpopulation operating on restricted</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources.</i><br>
<p>
If you're just going to parrot tired old justifications, show me some<br>
evidence to back it up.  I refuse to accept your naked assertions, and<br>
I have attempted to give some evidence that industry and publishing<br>
flourished in the absence of what you claim is necessary.  James Watt<br>
became a very wealthy and creative man, as he deserved, and asked no<br>
one to grant him any monopoly on his creations.  The great works of<br>
Shakespeare, Handel's Messiah, and the Mona Lisa were created without<br>
benefit of copyrights.  "IP" is a recent invention, justified by the<br>
same blind assumption you continue to make here, but not supported by<br>
the facts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If research is cheap, research labor costs would be very low, meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; researcher pay would be low. Thus you would create a disincentive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; pursue careers in research, and only the incompetent morons would enter</i><br>
<i>&gt; the field, much like primary education today.</i><br>
<p>
So, making research cheap and easy is /bad/, now?  Amazing.  Do you<br>
even believe in the free market at all?  That products will increase<br>
in quality as the market demands?  And when information is cheap, the<br>
value of /selection/ and /evaluation/ of information goes up, leading<br>
to a market for people with enough brains to find and sort through all<br>
the information.  Again, this I outlined in my earlier posts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The occurence of a truly new and spectacular idea from nothing is a rare</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and wonderful event--Newton's gravity, Darwin's evolution, and Einstein's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; general relativity are the only ones I can think of,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; none are inventions. They were scientific discoveries.</i><br>
<p>
What's the /objectively definable/ difference between discovering the<br>
inverse-square law of gravity and the LZW compression algorithm, or<br>
natural order spreadsheet recalculation, or a process for making soap,<br>
all of which are patented?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They are so now only because there is an IP system in place which</i><br>
<i>&gt; encourages and has encouraged their proliferation. Its interesting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you had no comment on my analysis showing that the average "dime a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dozen" invention was worth 4.55 million man hours in terms of relative</i><br>
<i>&gt; scarcity. if that is your opinion of the value of invention, I hesistate</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ask what your opinion is of the work of the common man. (Nuff cotton</i><br>
<i>&gt; deah, boss?)</i><br>
<p>
I don't remember any such analysis, but I'll look for it--but once again,<br>
you beg the very question by defining "invention" as "issued patent",<br>
further misvalued by the existing anti-market system.  Such an analysis<br>
is as invalid for justifying itself as saying that drugs cause prison<br>
costs, therefore we need more drug laws.  Can't you see that circularity?<br>
<p>
The labor of any man--in any field--is worth precisely what he can sell<br>
it for in a free market.  When Joe Montana makes a pass, his labor is<br>
worth thousands of dollars, because that's what people will pay to see it.<br>
When the cameraman gets paid to film it, his labor is worth whatever the<br>
network is paying him.  When the network broadcasts it, they charge for<br>
commercial time whatever advertisers will pay.  49 years from now,<br>
when Joe has stopped making passes and the cameraman retires, the network<br>
can still collect royalties from someone who taped the game on his home<br>
VCR and plays it for his friends, not because they would pay voluntarily,<br>
but because the government say so.  Where's the "labor" there?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; its interesting that a man who dislikes ad hominem attacks against</i><br>
<i>&gt; himself takes such glee in inciting them against others. Additionally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you still haven't paid enough attention or havent the intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; to figure out that my drive system does not violate conservation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; momentum shows that you are only interested in what you have to say and</i><br>
<i>&gt; not anyone else. I suggest you check your ego at the door.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but I couldn't resist.  You're right, I don't know anything<br>
about your drive, just the very limited information about it on your<br>
site, which /seems/ to violate conservation of momentum.  Perhaps the<br>
thing does something useful but not exactly what the page seems to say<br>
it does, or that there is something vital not said there.  In any case,<br>
I do apologize for the thinly-veiled ad hominem.  It was an attempt at<br>
humor, not a serious diparagement (not that I would shirk from serious<br>
disparagement for other reasons!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That software cannot be patented you seem to have conveniently</i><br>
<i>&gt; forgotten.</i><br>
<p>
That over 100,000 algorithms /are/ patented you seem to not realize.<br>
