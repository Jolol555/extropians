   In a very well thought out reply Chris Phoenix said:<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; Of course, this is a straw-man argument, because the people who</i><br>
<i>  &gt; predict gods are basing this not just on the progress of</i><br>
<i>  &gt; technology, but on the creation of new and immensely powerful life</i><br>
<i>  &gt; forms and thought forms.  I won't go as far as bugs vs. gods, but</i><br>
<i>  &gt; I'll agree that 2-year-olds vs. adults is a reasonable</i><br>
<i>  &gt; comparison--once those new life forms become possible.</i><br>
<p>
    Those new life forms are possible, and they are us.  Twenty years<br>
ago, it would--and did--take me months to do the some of the things I<br>
currently do several times per week.  The web has become an extension<br>
of my memory, and I use it as such.  I may not seem godlike to you, or<br>
to me for that matter, but as for the me of twenty years ago, he would<br>
feel like your 2-year-old above.  Not dumb, but with decades of<br>
learning required to catch up.<br>
<p>
   Also twenty years ago the P?=NP issue was very hot.  Today, we are<br>
working on quantum computers where the answer probably not only will<br>
be P=NP, but P=NP=O(1).*<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; ...If we have as much as a month between large-scale nanotech and</i><br>
<i>  &gt; godlings, there is a possibility of making choices that will</i><br>
<i>  &gt; affect the kind of godlings we create.  For example, it is worth</i><br>
<i>  &gt; thinking about the effect that food machines and utility fog might</i><br>
<i>  &gt; have on society, even if that period of history only lasts a</i><br>
<i>  &gt; month.</i><br>
<p>
   Nice image.  I've always looked at it this way:  How long will it<br>
take for computer technology to get to the point where I can design an<br>
Drexlerian assembler in my spare time?  I figure less than 20 years.<br>
Will the technology be there to convert than design into silicon or<br>
whatever?  Sure.  If the tools are not available, designing and<br>
building some of them will be an extra weekend project by then.<br>
<p>
   I'll give you a different problem to worry about...  There are<br>
people of all ages today who are falling off the technological<br>
bandwagon.  Those who manage to stay on the tiger (Mixed metaphores?<br>
Why not?), are getting further and further ahead of those not on<br>
board.  Will there be a point at which no one not already on the train<br>
can get on?  Sure looks like it.  That is the problem I worry about.<br>
<p>
    Not that machines will become like gods and obsolete the human<br>
race.  The direction we are approaching the future from means that<br>
systems including people and machines will always have the edge.  But<br>
that we need to constantly work at making it possible for our children<br>
to have a place in the future.  Today's educational system is woefully<br>
inadequate to prepare anyone for life in the eighties.  It will take a<br>
revolution (and one is going on but a lot of the educational community<br>
is trying to stay out of it) to provide an educational system adequate<br>
for the next century^H^H^H^H^H^H^H decade.<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; Will the future simply be an amplification of the present, or will</i><br>
<i>  &gt; it be completely chaotic and unpredictable?  It takes only one</i><br>
<i>  &gt; successful gray goo or engineered virus to make it</i><br>
<i>  &gt; unpredictable--but barring those, things we do today might have an</i><br>
<i>  &gt; effect on whether the first gods care about us or not, and things</i><br>
<i>  &gt; we do in the time between large-scale nanotech and large-scale</i><br>
<i>  &gt; intelligence will almost certainly have an effect.</i><br>
<p>
   I'm still not convinced that it is possible for the two to arrive<br>
in that order.  And at fifty-one, I may not make it into your first<br>
gods category, but I suspect that a majority of those reading this<br>
will.<br>
<p>
   There is a story I like to tell to put this in perspective.  At my<br>
sister's eighteenth birthday party, we were all gathered around the<br>
television waiting for Neal Armstrong to open the Eagle's door.  I had<br>
worked on the ACG (Apollo Guidance Computer), my father had designed<br>
and built power supplies for the radars at Cape Canaveral (before it<br>
became Kennedy Spaceflight Center).  My mother's father, Bud<br>
Eichelburger, also there had literally learned to fly from the Wright<br>
Brothers, and flew fighters in France in WWI.  His wife, also there<br>
knew all the original seven astronauts, and had flown with them (but<br>
on commercial flights).  That, however, is another story.<br>
<p>
   For something to do while the pressure was being pumped down in the<br>
LEM, I started telling some of the story behind the story of the<br>
camera that would record the first steps on the moon, and why this one<br>
was black and white.  In particular, I explained that although Apollo<br>
8 had shown the advantages of taking a color TV camera to the moon,<br>
that even getting this black and white camera on the LM had been<br>
difficult, and it almost hadn't made it.<br>
<p>
   At this point the camera was turned on, and my mother read the<br>
caption...  "Live from the moon! When I was a child we said that<br>
something was as likely as flying to the moon when we meant that it<br>
was impossible."<br>
<p>
   Her father interrupted. "Helen, remember the night I came up to<br>
your bedroom and said that an Army budd of mine was leaving on a<br>
flight, and I might never have a chance to see him again?  Then we<br>
took the train up to New York to see him off?  I never though<br>
Lindburgh would make it!"<br>
<p>
   A few years later I was sitting with Bud, watching Voyager II<br>
pictures captioned "Live from Saturn".  I quoted his previous line<br>
about Lindburgh and we all had a good laugh.  Since then, whenever<br>
someone has told me that something wouldn't happen in my lifetime, I<br>
just laugh.<br>
<p>

   *For those of you to whom this is so much gibberish, a translation<br>
that any competent complexity theorist will cringe at: Twenty years<br>
ago: If P is not equal to NP, there is a large set of problems which<br>
we can never hope to solve.  If P = NP, then those problems are<br>
theoretically but not practically within reach.  Today: We are solving<br>
problems that twenty years ago looked to be totally beyond the pale,<br>
and quantum computers will be here soon.  If quantum computers can<br>
solve NP-complete problems as seems probable, then any mathematical<br>
problem with an answer that can be easily shown to be correct will be<br>
computable in under a second.<br>
<p>
   For scale, the largest hard composite numbers, factored in days or<br>
weeks 20 years ago, are today factored in seconds.  The most recent<br>
results in this area used thousands of MIPS years of computer time.<br>
Quantum computers may soon solve that problem in fractions of a<br>
second.  To give you a practical example of why this is important even<br>
ten years ago "routing" a chip or a PC board could take weeks of CPU<br>
time, even with a dedicated engineer to help.  Showing that a given<br>
routing meets all the design rules is in NP, as is the design of a<br>
working assembler.<br>
