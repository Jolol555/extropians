I am looking for the best description of reasons to arrange for long life.<br>
This will be an e-text continuation of the Life Quest Mission.<br>

For now, I am seeking freewear to distribute to the widest possible audience.<br>
<p>
Please let me know if you have any such sf that you want me to post on my <br>
ftp sight. E-text only, as I do not yet have access to www graphics.<br>

Signature Memetic Virus<br>
<p>
The worst enemy of those who now or will need medical care is the politician <br>
who proscribes what doctors are allowed to prescribe and research,<br>
.with their patients permission,<br>
<p>
Those who understand this are strongly encouraged to modify this to <br>
fit their personality, and add this to their signature file, and<br>
organize to recover our freedom from Big Brother.<br>
<p>
For those who wait until they are sick, it will be too late.<br>
<p>
Those who suffer from diseases which might have been cured by fetal tissue <br>
research or schedule 1 drugs banned by Big Brother have the right to<br>
hold those accountable who sat on their hands while they remained ill.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Long healthy life.<br>
