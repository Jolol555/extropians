Also, subsidies are paid by governments to farmers because of<br>
OVERSUPPLY. Farmers are just too good at their jobs. Granted that with<br>
some areas of the world in famine, this should not be true, but the<br>
limits of transportation and distribution are at fault here, not<br>
farmers. Vermont bans the use of BGH in domestic milk that can carry the<br>
Vermont label, and is in a court battle with industry groups from other<br>
states over this, as it makes their milk appear to be inferior in the<br>
market compared to the "hormone free" Vermont made milk. Farmers have<br>
needed subsidies beacuse their business is heavily laden with capital<br>
costs. SInce the Federal Reserve and the other people who determine the<br>
official inflation rate and interest rates have consistently<br>
overestimated inflation, farmers capital costs have been unfairly higher<br>
than they should be, thus making their totally competetive market drift<br>
toward consolidation in big corporate farming. It is this sort of<br>
influence of government on economic factors that leads to enterprise<br>
consolidation and the development of monopolies. THis is what<br>
mercantilism is.<br>
