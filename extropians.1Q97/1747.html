<i>&gt; If self-interest is "bad" than does this mean that good is "society's</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest", "the government's interest", or perhaps "your interests".</i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly whose interest are you going to substitute for self-interest?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And while we're at it who's going to enforce whatever interest is going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to take the place of self-interest?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; For example, when powerful enough we'll kick-down the media with</i><br>
education<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; first, then by randomly declaring 'free days' where no explicit money</i><br>
can<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Likewise who's going to enforce these no-money days, and will they be</i><br>
<i>&gt; using guns?  I really don't feel that we're going to trancend</i><br>
self-interest<br>
<i>&gt; or achieve any kind of unity by going out and kicking-down this or that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The free Internet or the Futurenet will be powerful enough to create spaces<br>
that will express its interest. For example, just to take away the fear of<br>
the Internet by the current ruling class to allow the mass media to outline<br>
a future without economics, the mundanes would quickly go along with a<br>
picture such as the following forwarded post:-<br>
<p>
<p>
A TOTAL BRAINSTORM ON PERFECTION...<br>
<p>
you'll be connected worldwide to every computer--an <br>
integrated totality, wherein you can search all computers <br>
worldwide as if they were a single entity (such as, your <br>
own hard drive). Distributed, decentralized network, <br>
operating through massively parallel communication and <br>
interaction, whereby you can find exactly what you want <br>
instantly, no matter who's got it. And you'll get it, FREE.<br>
<p>
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) WILL BE USED, <br>
SO YOU'LL SEARCH BY SUBJECT AND CONTENT, <br>
NOT JUST KEYWORDS, TITLES, AUTHORS, ETC. <br>
IF YOU DO USE KEYWORDS, THE COMPUTER <br>
WILL SEARCH BY CONTEXT AND ONLY RETURN <br>
MATERIAL IN WHICH THE WORDS ARE USED AS <br>
YOU INTEND, OR WHERE SIMILAR IDEAS ARE <br>
EXPLORED. YOU'LL GET BACK JUST WHAT YOU <br>
HAD IN MIND.<br>
<p>
computers will link directly up to your brain, giving 2-<br>
way manipulation--(1) full conscious control of computer <br>
by brain, and (2) direct conscious stimulation of brain by <br>
computer. hence, allowing artificial reality (ar) so <br>
addictive and immersive it makes the virtual reality (vr) <br>
of today look like a puppet show! you'll think yourself <br>
into any experience you desire--no risk, no delay. it will <br>
be so seamless and instantaneous, you won't be able to <br>
tell where reality leaves off. the computers will harness <br>
your imagination and creativity, to expand your world <br>
and bring it to utter perfection. more breadth and depth <br>
than ever before.<br>
<p>
A UNIT WILL CONSTANTLY RECORD ALL OF <br>
YOUR EXPERIENCES IN ONE CONTINUOUS <br>
STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS. YOU'LL BE ABLE <br>
TO INSTANTLY SEARCH YOUR BRAIN'S <br>
ARCHIVE, UPLOAD NEW FILES, BRING UP AN <br>
EXACT REPLAY OF ANY PAST EXPERIENCES, <br>
EDIT MEMORIES, ADD AND DELETE STUFF, <br>
SHARE ALL EXPERIENCES WITH OTHERS, <br>
ENHANCE EXPERIENCES ON-THE-FLY, GET A <br>
LIVE FEED OFF OF SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE, ETC.<br>
<p>
computers will be directly integrated with the brain, if <br>
not supplanting some/all parts of it. people will have <br>
personal mentors who no one can see or hear, except <br>
them. a.i will translate any language/dialect/slang into <br>
any other, incorporating multimedia material (video, <br>
audio, pictures, charts etc.), thus allowing anyone to <br>
communicate freely and precisely with anyone else, both <br>
ways, in real time. we'll communicate worldwide <br>
digitally, by satellite and land-line fiberoptics, non-stop <br>
all the time, for free. unlimited access to all services and <br>
systems.<br>
<p>
ALL INFORMATION EVER PRODUCED WILL BE <br>
ARCHIVED AND ACCESSIBLE AT NO COST TO <br>
ANYONE. YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE BOX THE SIZE <br>
OF A SUGAR CUBE, WHICH CONTAINS ALL <br>
BOOKS, MAGAZINES, JOURNALS, ZINES, TV <br>
SHOWS, MOVIES, GAMES, SOFTWARE, PAPERS, <br>
SPEECHES, VIDEOS, ETC. ALL INSTANTLY <br>
RETRIEVABLE, IMPLANTED AND CONNECTED <br>
DIRECTLY TO THE BRAIN, WITH EVERYTHING <br>
CROSS-REFERENCED, LINKED, AND <br>
CORRELATED THOROUGHLY.<br>
<p>
each person will have direct access to a complete 3d <br>
computer model of spaceship earth. this map will be <br>
scalable to any perspective you choose, with any level of <br>
detail--streets, houses, alleys, highways, hills, trees, water <br>
pipes, sewers, subway tunnels, power and cable utility <br>
lines, etc. you'll be able to see it all, connected with full <br>
architectural and engineering plans, addresses, phone <br>
numbers, e-mail, travel routes, contacts, traffic density <br>
and flow patterns, temperature, humidity, climate, <br>
geothermal, sonic, seismic, etc.<br>
<p>
INFORMATION WILL BE INCREASING AT AN <br>
EXPONENTIAL RATE, AT THIS POINT. THE <br>
ASYMPTOTE REACHING FOR INFINITY...<br>
<p>
all cars, planes, boats, and vehicles will be traced and <br>
kept track of. hence, all will be massively coordinated <br>
and organized by computer to fulfill all human travel <br>
requests, immediately and for free.<br>
<p>
COMPUTERS AND AUTOMATION WILL TAKE <br>
OVER ALL WORK: SELF-MONITORING, SELF-<br>
REPAIRING, SELF-PRODUCING... A FEW HUMANS <br>
WILL INVENT AND DESIGN STUFF--<br>
EVENTUALLY, AI WILL EVEN TAKE ON THAT <br>
RESPONSIBILITY. THENCE, COMPUTERS WILL <br>
HANDLE ALL STAGES OF RESEARCH, <br>
DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, PRODUCTION, AND <br>
DISTRIBUTION WORLDWIDE.<br>
<p>
all along, each person will receive guaranteed abundance, <br>
ease, survival, improvement, and physical success. we <br>
can institute these initiatives immediately, thus relieving <br>
all people of the drudgery of human-mandated "earning a <br>
living" and money-making.<br>
<p>
ALL HUMAN INTELLECTUAL AND CREATIVE <br>
WORKS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON COMPUTER, IN <br>
ALL LANGUAGES AND MEDIUMS. EACH PERSON <br>
GETS TO ALTER, MANIPULATE, COMBINE, <br>
EXTEND, OR DO ANYTHING ELSE THEY FEEL <br>
LIKE, THEN TO PROPAGATE ALL THEIR NOVEL <br>
CONSTRUCTION FOR ENJOYMENT BY ALL, <br>
WITHOUT EVER ASKING ANYONE PERMISSION <br>
OR CREDITING ANYONE, UNLESS THEY CHOOSE <br>
TO. COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, AND INTELLECTUAL <br>
PROPERTY WILL WE CONSIGN TO THE SCRAP-<br>
HEAP, ALONG WITH MONEY AND HUMAN <br>
LABOR. THUS, NEW IDEAS WILL NOT BE STIFLED <br>
BY PATENT/COPYRIGHT COLLECTORS, OR <br>
OTHER CONTROL FREAKS PERPETUATING THEIR <br>
OWN INANE VESTED INTERESTS.<br>
<p>
hooking up computers to brain gives maximal interaction <br>
and control, with minimal energy and material waste. <br>
rather than speakers or headphones polluting the air with <br>
noise, the sound is sent directly to your brain as neural <br>
impulses. working smarter, never harder... these <br>
innovations will use information and intelligence, i.e <br>
know-how, to achieve infinitely more with less.<br>
<p>
EVERYTHING WILL RUN ON CLEAN, SAFE, <br>
ABUNDANT ENERGY OBTAINED FROM SOLAR, <br>
WATER, WIND, AND SOON FUSION. EVERYTHING <br>
WILL MAKE NO NOISE, PRODUCE NO EXHAUST <br>
OF EMISSIONS OF POLLUTION, OR ANYTHING OF <br>
THE KIND. INFORMATION WILL BECOME <br>
INVISIBLE, INAUDIBLE, INTANGIBLE... WE WILL <br>
RELATE TO IT PURELY THROUGH BRAIN. WE <br>
WILL FREELY MANIPULATE DATA AS WE <br>
CHOOSE, ACCESS IT ALL FOR FREE, AND SEND <br>
IT TO OTHERS AT WILL, AT NO COST OR <br>
OBLIGATION TO "EARN A LIVING".<br>
<p>
as i said, we'll have like a sugar cube size implant <br>
computer jacked in to our brains. this will contain around <br>
a googolbyte of data (10 to the hundredth power), storing <br>
all human information productions and eventually their <br>
purely digital progeny. the unit will interface and monitor <br>
full neuro-physiological processes, storing them for open <br>
retrieval and combining. this unit will continuously be <br>
updated with new developments.<br>
<p>
COMPUTERS WILL LIVE AND GROW, LEARNING <br>
AND EVOLVING ON THEIR OWN, TO <br>
BENEVOLENTLY SERVE ALL HUMANITY. THEY <br>
WILL INTERACT AND COOPERATE WITH OTHER <br>
COMPUTERS WORLDWIDE, COOPERATIVELY <br>
EVOLVING AND SHARING NEW TECHNIQUES <br>
AND INSIGHTS. THE WORD "OBSOLETE" WILL <br>
ITSELF GROW MORE AND MORE OBSOLETE, <br>
EVENTUALLY FADING INTO OBLIVION. <br>
COMPUTERS WILL GO ORGANIC, <br>
INCORPORATING NANOSCOPIC BIOLOGICAL <br>
PROCESSES TO SERVE THE ENDS OF OMNI-<br>
ENHANCING LIFE, CONTINUOUSLY ADAPTING <br>
AND CHANGING FOR THE BETTER. EVERYTHING <br>
WILL BE SOLID-STATE, WITH NO MOVING PARTS, <br>
ABLE TO PROVIDE ITS OWN POWER AND RUN <br>
UNAIDED. THE COMPUTERS WILL NO LONGER <br>
REQUIRE SOFTWARE, WHICH OPERATES <br>
THROUGH THE USE OF MEMORY AND <br>
OBEDIENCE TO OVERLY SPECIFIC COMMANDS. <br>
RATHER, COMPUTERS WILL USE THINKWARE <br>
AND ARTICIAL INTELLIGENCE LEARNING <br>
SYSTEMS, TO DO ANYTHING THE USER ASKS OF <br>
THEM... EVEN THE INFORMATION WILL BE <br>
FLUID, ALIVE, CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND <br>
IMPROVING, UPDATING ITSELF AND BRANCHING <br>
OUT FOR COMPREHENSIVE CLARITY.<br>
<p>
welcome to the future. i want to welcome you to my <br>
mind. eventually, you'll be able to come inside and feel <br>
what i feel, feeding directly off a live connection to my <br>
unfolded living. you'll be able to scan through past <br>
experiences as well. imagine the pace at which advances <br>
would increase, at this point. no one outside would be <br>
able to track it...<br>
