OK, what you seems to say is that if I put damage sensors in a robot, it <br>
would be able to feel pain. But this relates to the awfully tricky <br>
problem of qualia: does the robot *experience* pain, or doe it just think <br>
"pain"? How can we tell? <br>
<p>
(My personal view is that the hardware doesn't matter; after all, <br>
stimulating a sensor or nerve produces the same sensation, so the qualia <br>
are likely happining in the brain, which I also think could be run on a <br>
different hardware)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If a computer is to feel pleasure from the outside world it will require</i><br>

<i>&gt; We can program computers to think because that is what the hardware was</i><br>

<p>
It would be quite possible to create programs that can watch their <br>
internal states and hence feel internal pleasure, no hardware needed. In <br>
fact, programs that watch or affect their own states have been written <br>
(but as far as I know nobody has done anything truly serious with it).<br>
