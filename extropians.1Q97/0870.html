<i>&gt; It seems we're close to agreement. I don't know that I can talk for</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone, but my sense is that in general it's easier to learn "Don't do</i><br>
<i>&gt; that while you're upset." than it is "Don't let it bother you". However, I'm</i><br>

<i>&gt; of control over your thinking and the feeling it produces, you don't have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; battle with yourself everytime someone says something potentially upsetting.</i><br>
<p>
The danger and difficulty with "Don't let it bother you" is that it <br>
is very easy to fool yourself into into to believing that is doesn't <br>
bother you when it actually does.  This can lead to no end of <br>
trouble.<br>
