<i>&gt; I'm not sure I see the necessity of preventing someone from changing</i><br>
<i>&gt; his posted information.  If he presents a weak argument, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; withdraws it, haven't those who disagree accomplished their purpose?</i><br>
<i>&gt; How much more is gained by continuing to throw his earlier errors in</i><br>
<i>&gt; his face?  If the goal is to approach the truth, then there should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing wrong with people evolving their publications in the face of</i><br>
<i>&gt; criticism.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  Why wouldn't I?  If you're presenting argument, the<br>
identity of source is just a distraction.  Arguments must argue<br>
content, not personality.  Therefore, when presenting a rebuttal to<br>
a point of view, you must include the point of view /as it is/ to<br>
reply.  If the source later changes his mind, that's fine; I don't<br>
care.  Ideas matter more than who holds them.<br>
<p>
Since most ideas will be attributed, it would be fair to ensure<br>
that you included the dates of the quote, and perhaps commentary<br>
that the opinion of the source has changed (especially if that<br>
supports your point of view).  But you can't force anyone to say<br>
or not say anything he damn well pleases.  And you especiall can't<br>
expect any "active inclusion" of someone else's text to remain in<br>
any consistent state, because you don't own it.  Copying to your<br>
server is the only way to preserve your arguments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree that for some purposes, like official documents, contracts, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the like, a method is needed to hold them stably.  But for hypertext</i><br>
<i>&gt; publishing and debate, it seems counterproductive to try to keep people</i><br>
<i>&gt; from revising their work.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely!  How could anything I said possibly be construed otherwise?<br>
I am really at a loss to see how my words could produce your reaction.<br>
I don't want to "keep people" from doing anything!  That's my whole point.<br>
I utterly reject any attempt to restrict what anyone may say at any time<br>
for any reason.  Period.  Do not tell me I claim otherwise.  It is<br>
precisely because of that that in order to rebut a /point of view/--which<br>
exists independently of the one expressing it--one must make sure that<br>
the words are on your server, because you have to expect his to change<br>
with time.  Whether or not you change your attributions, update your own<br>
arguments to reflect his changes, etc. is entirely up to you, and what<br>
he does on his server is entirely up to him.<br>
