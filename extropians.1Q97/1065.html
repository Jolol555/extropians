DISCLAIMER: THE VIEWS I'M ABOUT TO EXPRESS ARE MY OWN, AND BEAR NO <br>
  REFLECTION ON THOSE FINE FOLKS WHO OFFER ME EMPLOYMENT.<br>

<i>&gt;Sometimes self-interest isn't enough to propagate a meme!  Immortality</i><br>
<i>&gt;and digital communities are very much in my interest, but they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;take advantage of the built-in *political* emotions, the ones which lead</i><br>
<i>&gt;us to instinctively share our views with others.  You have to either (1)</i><br>
<i>&gt;attack the current political system, (2) defend it, or (3) use a memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;sleight-of-hand to utilize the emotions powering (1) and (2) above.</i><br>
<p>
 It appears to me that a common mistake about rationized memes is<br>
 found in the overestimation of its strength:  If one "purifies" the<br>
 rationalizations by eliminating emotion and/or politeness, one thus <br>
 reduces its *persuasiveness.*<br>
<p>
 Perhaps some memes can help improve discernment of Sense vs. Sensation,<br>
 but the two are not mutually exclusive.  The strongest memes would<br>
 have the teeth and claws that defeat both the apathy of flatness<br>
 and the torture-tests of rational validity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problem with Extropian memes is that they involve goals which will</i><br>
<i>&gt;benefit *everyone*, *equally*.  You just can't do that and propagate</i><br>
<i>&gt;your meme.  There has to be someone to take the fall or it isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;politics.  Frankly, I think the Christians hit on the best solution with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Satan:  Pin all the blame on a fantasy entity.  The only problem is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;we'd have to lie.  Maybe we could demonize death? </i><br>
<p>
 Yes, Demonize DECOMPOSITION.  We are all actively *perishing* the moment<br>
 we hit adulthood, and it's all been accepted as "natural."  Death and<br>
 taxes have been accepted as the only inescapable truths, and it's time<br>
 we made liars of them both.<br>
<p>
 The success of the Satan meme is not trivial... notice that even the<br>
 recent "Freddy Kruger" and "Jason" flicks depict their villians as<br>
 being "Straight from Hell."  It's one thing to blame things on "Sin"<br>
 as those obstacles we let stand between ourselves and God... Yet, it's<br>
 a much more powerful suggestion to say that there is a malicious<br>
 intelligence that is stalking us, bent on the goal of our destruction.<br>
<p>
 Extropians usually want to disempower superstition.  I for one <br>
 wouldn't mind seeing the start of a discipline called "Y'shuaism"<br>
 which would be everything Christianity was meant to be, without<br>
 the superstition and judgementality.  (One can be a disciple of<br>
 Jesus' teachings, similar to Confucianism, without the need for<br>
 the Divine mythos that was later built around it.  Jesus was a<br>
 healer, not a rabbi or soldier, and his only true "diety" is that<br>
 he was a "son" of the "God is Love" equation.)<br>
<p>
 Actually, there would be a great many benefits to such a discipline.<br>
 The now-ambiguous term 'Love' could be replaced with 'Compassionate<br>
 Concern,' which would help defeat ignorant hatred.  It could once again<br>
 be emphasized the need to Discern "the Sin from the Sinner" and<br>
 "the Act from the Actor", realizing the massive potentials of choice<br>
 we all possess.  We could mature beyond intollerance of differences and<br>
 eye-for-eye judgementality, learning instead that our problem-solving <br>
 choices are not bound to the flaws of others.  We could follow an <br>
 example to offer others Life and Life more abundant, raising up those <br>
 who would save us from (physically and emotionally) perishing.<br>
 <br>
 Let us, as Extropians, raise up Saviors in our Land.  Let us fight<br>
 the forces of invalidation, ignorance, and the agents of perishing! <br>
 So long, entropy! ;-)<br>
