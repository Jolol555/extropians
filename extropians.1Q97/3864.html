In a message dated 97-03-22 13:28:08 EST, you write:  <br>
  <br>
&lt;&lt; Refusal to take other  <br>
 people's concerns seriously, especially when raised in polite, rational<br>
ways,  <br>
 will not serve us as knowledge seekers or in spreading memes. It can also  <br>
 create blind spots in our own psyche (IMHO). &gt;&gt;  <br>
  <br>
In the public forum yes, I agree. . . By a friend who comes right out and<br>
says "I hope you fail and will work against you."  NO! <br>
 <br>
I have a hard time taking other peoples concerns seriously when it comes to<br>
limiting science, technology,  e.g., banning cloning, etc.  The greatest<br>
arguments against these technologies is based on fear that there will be<br>
inadequate safeguards for the new technology.  This translates into fear of<br>
god for religious people and generally, fear of a disaster.  Fear is the<br>
greatest de-motivator (to a much lesser extent, a motivator) of change in<br>
human history and is tied to pessimism _not_ optimism.    <br>
 <br>
Pessimism was an evolutionary survival advantage and has a long history.<br>
 People who were pessimistic stored more food and water for times of shortage<br>
and fear was the motivator for this survivalist activity.    <br>
 <br>
But there are at least two kinds of fear.  First, fear that technology<br>
_will_cause_ a disaster and second, fear technology will _not_ find the<br>
solutions to our problems and therefore not improve our quality of life.<br>
 Both are pessimistic.  The problem gets worse when pessimism turns into<br>
depression and that leads to giving up on technology and can regress back<br>
into the non-science supernatural.  <br>
 <br>
To me,  fear of _technology_ is an _anti-survival_ idea.  A spear, knife,<br>
arrow, ax, gun , nuclear bomb is dangerous and can cause lost of life.  If<br>
people feared fire so much they banned it, where would we be now?  Dead.  The<br>
key is learning to control the technology so the disaster fears are quieted.<br>
 This is what should be discussed. <br>
  <br>
As a research and development scientist, I work on developing technologies<br>
including the safeguards for those technologies.  Fear must not be a<br>
de-motivator for me to develop technology.  Overcoming fear is required in<br>
order for me to do my job.   <br>
 <br>
With few exceptions (Small Pox) working with the most dangerous<br>
microorganisms ever known should not be banned even though they could "get<br>
loose" and cause a disaster.  Some people and laboratories are not qualified<br>
to work on these, that is true.  The medical treatments in general out weigh<br>
the potential disasters.  I can show people how we are controlling the<br>
microorganisms while we are working with them to quiet their fears (as my<br>
fears have been quieted).  But that is about all I think I can do and still<br>
have time to work on the projects. <br>
 <br>
I would not be a good person to talk about the fears of others about<br>
technology because I am firstly pro-science and pro-technology.  I am biased.<br>
 I admit it.  i.e. unless I constantly talked about the science of the<br>
safeguards and not the technology itself.  Perhaps I could turn that into a<br>
positive and be OK with it.    <br>
  <br>
So, I choose to talk about the optimistic areas of developing technology and<br>
not the safeguards too much.  I leave it to others, better diplomats like Ed<br>
Regis to debate nanotechnology (see Brain Tennis from<br>
<a href="http://www.hotwired.com/frontdoor/">http://www.hotwired.com/frontdoor/</a>).  We need the R&amp;D group, the customer<br>
input group and the third party (but please not government) to meld the R&amp;D<br>
and customer groups into development of the new technology. <br>
