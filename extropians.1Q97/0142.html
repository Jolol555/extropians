I have to disagree.  Grades and degrees reflect that you did the work<br>
expected of you.  They do not reflect that you learned anything.  This may<br>
be a fault of the system more than anything, but I don't think grades or<br>
degrees reflect knowledge.  I know many people who have degrees in technical<br>
fields who are unqualified by any other standard.  I have gotten mediocre<br>
grades in classes because I didn't do any of the homework, even though I got<br>
A's on all the exams and was possibly more qualified than the teacher. <br>
<p>
Schools are ineffective because they don't reward learning.  They reward work.<br>
