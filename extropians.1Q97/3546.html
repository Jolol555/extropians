Gibson and Sterling collaborated on _The Difference Engine_ which is<br>
referred to as "steampunk".  The premise of the book is: Imagine if we had<br>
calculating machines 150 years ago. There is some very interesting flights<br>
of fancy about programmers, software and the social and political<br>
ramifications of computer technology. Its a good yarn involving internal<br>
combustion vs steam engines, sudden wealth, competing dinosaur theories,<br>
massive air pollution, Luddites (the originals) all set among (one<br>
presumes) the little known realities and quirks of "modern" life in the<br>
early 19th century. The ending was a disappointment in the usual Gibsonian<br>
mold - vague murky conspiratorial goings-on I found impenetrable. But it<br>
was a fun ride along the way.<br>
<p>
BTW, the SciAm article tells an interesting story. I always assumed that<br>
Babbage never completed his inventions because he'd become obseesed with<br>
ideas for improvements that would of course delay project completion. In<br>
fact he was held up by some of my EE professors in college as a classic<br>
case of "creeping elegance" - "Don't let this happen to you!" Now I realize<br>
that he couldn't get funding because he couldn't convince the British<br>
government of the utility of such a machine - a different lesson altogether<br>
and one entrepreneurs the world over can relate to, I think.<br>
