You might have fun with Neitsche's "The Antichrist."  There's a section<br>
where he sort of off-handedly says what he thinks Jesus was *really*<br>
trying to say, followed by an analysis of what he thinks Paul and the<br>
Church did with it.  Basically the idea is that sufficiently<br>
metaphorical yet powerful liberating ideas can be used as fuel when<br>
inserted into the right enslaving framework.  (Yet I don't think<br>
Neech anticipated the same thing being done with his ideas by the Nazis.)<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you're not sensitive to certain ideas about<br>
inner peace and ruthlessness, you might not like anything Neitsche says.<br>
