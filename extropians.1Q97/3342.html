	I have a few points to make here.  Transhumanism is a very<br>
reasonable and scientifically sound philosophy, but we also make use of<br>
imagery and creative talent, not always sticking with dedication to our<br>
scientific principles in our art.  But that is the point.  Art exists, in<br>
a large part, not only to express, but to inspire.  Art is not bound by<br>
physical law, we are able to express situations that are beyond<br>
our current ability.  I suggest that you refrain from trying to smother<br>
our forward movement in your pessimism.  If you have valid, logical<br>
disagreements, we will certainly hear them,  but please don't make wild<br>
assumptions and accusations.  <br>
