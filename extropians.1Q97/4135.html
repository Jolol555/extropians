<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot simply program emotions if the hardware cannot experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; them. My body including my brain can experience emotions. Computers, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of yet, cannot experience emotions, and this is not so much a software</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem as it is a hardware problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anders Sandberg responded:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What do you base this assertion on?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can you merely program a computer to see without creating optical</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware? No! You can program pattern recognizing neural nets day in and</i><br>
<i>&gt; day out, but until you give the computer hardware [optics] to see with,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it cannot see ... no matter how hard you try to program it to do so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Emotions are felt in a physical manner. I *feel* sexual pleasure via my</i><br>
<i>&gt; organs. I *feel* hunger via my organs. I *feel* excitement via my</i><br>
<i>&gt; organs. Without this specialized hardware I would *feel* nothing. As a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer I might be "aware" of conditions, but I would not *feel* those</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions unless someone created specialized hardware that would allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; me to *feel*.</i><br>
<p>
Like the man said, what evidence do you have of this?  The fact that<br>
you experience physical sensations at the same time as your cognitive<br>
state of emotion provides no evidence of which is cause and which is<br>
effect, nor does it prove that there is anything necessary about those<br>
physical sensations to achieve the cognitive state. <br>
<p>
What is the common cognitive process that occurs when a blind man<br>
hears a beatiful piece of music, and a deaf man sees a beautiful<br>
work of art?  They share /something/ in common we call "beauty",<br>
but it cannot be the mere sensations that evoked it; it must be some<br>
mental state that we can recogize and express.  Cameras and audio<br>
recorders "see" and "hear" the same things, but they do not have<br>
cognitive states.  A computer does.  To assume that a computer<br>
can't recognize, experience, and express that same state from<br>
whatever inputs it has is groundless anthropocentrism.  If a computer<br>
tells me that the bit-pattern I just entered into its front panel is<br>
beautiful, who am I to tell him otherwise?<br>
