AS&gt; It can be argued that Extropianism per se doesn't make<br>
AS&gt; claims about divinity,...<br>
<p>
The trouble with the divine is that nobody who wants me to believe<br>
in it ever bothers to define what it is, or even acknowledge that<br>
they should.  Since they won't define it, I can only garner its<br>
meaning from the context in which they use the words.  As far as I<br>
can determine, people who use the word "God" use it mostly to mean<br>
"some entity that is the cause of all things I don't understand the<br>
cause of."   God is ignorance.  If anybody can show me how this<br>
concept is useful, any more than the concept of some sacred place<br>
where lies each lost pen and unmatched sock, I'll join in too.<br>
<p>
I am a bit less dismissive about planet-worshippers like the CAW<br>
folks and other neo-pagans.  Even though I imagine an extropian<br>
future travelling space, I have to admit that for the moment I'm<br>
stuck on this insignificant little ball of dirt, so I'd better<br>
adapt to it.  And its rich diversity of creatures do a great job<br>
of teaching me about myself.  How backward would the study of<br>
genetics and evolution be without E. coli and D. melanogaster?<br>
I don't see the use, though, of naming and personifying it, an<br>
ascribing will to it.  That seems to me like it would get in the<br>
way of understanding what it's really like.<br>
