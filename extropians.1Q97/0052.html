Apollo took four days to get to the moon (unless that was the length of<br>
the entire mission.)  Military missiles should be able to take one day<br>
or less.  As for Earth... use those Saturns to put lots of missiles in<br>
terrestrial orbit.  Then the Lunies are also at the bottom of a gravity<br>
well.  True, from Earth orbit you'd still need to give them a big kick<br>
to reach the Moon quickly, but you can get out of Earth's gravity well<br>
ahead of time.<br>
<p>
And quite possibly frigates or bases would be put in *lunar* orbit.<br>
Better aim, and faster.  If the energy isn't enough, use nukes.  Not<br>
much to contaminate down there...<br>

6 feet isn't much protection in the kind of warfare we're talking about.<br>

<p>
How do you know the population would still be ignorant of civil defense?<br>
You're changing one factor and assuming all other stay constant, when<br>
the first change could well change other relevant factors.  But whether<br>
civil defense is meaningful for a big and intraconnected target is<br>
debatable.  A different problem is that the spacers may not be willing<br>
to engage in MAD against Earth.  Earth has tons of people and the only<br>
natural ecosystem -- certainly of any complexity.  Colonists *could*<br>
have an ornery 'screw-you' attitude, willing to wipe all of the above<br>
out for their own survival or independence; but they could also be much<br>
more reverent or 'moral', and find threatening 'wipeout' against the<br>
Mother World repugnant or unthinkable.  Asimov's Settlers are as likely<br>
as Heinlein's Loonies.  <br>
<p>
Earth, by contrast, has the problem of wiping out a few thousand<br>
ingrates wielding a big gun on a dead world.  Zap.  <br>
