Unless I'm mistaken, that's `The Eyeflash Miracles' by Gene Wolfe (1976).<br>
Yawn.  I've been grimly entertained by most media commentators (sorry Ravn)<br>
making such remarks, including the scientist in the original news report who<br>
told us he had this *great new sci fi idea* for cloning Jesus.  When Peter<br>
Goldsworthy did this in HONK IF YOU ARE JESUS a few years, I thought it was<br>
an *example* of cloning.  Sorry, team, it's all been done.  Gilbert Gosseyn<br>
(Go-Sane) in van Vogt's Null-A novels was a clone with replacements lurking<br>
in the tank back in the 1940s.  In 1973, Nancy Freedman cloned JFK in<br>
JOSHUA, SON OF NONE.  Kate Wilhelm's WHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG, the<br>
classic clone novel, came out in 1976 (winning the Hugo award for year's<br>
best sf novel) and canvassed most of the possibilities, as did Pam<br>
Sargeant's CLONED LIVES the same year.  Varley is crawling with these plots,<br>
and Egan carries them further.  Even a late-comer like Lois McMaster Bujold<br>
has done it.  Her recent Miles Vorkosigan novel (the titles of these<br>
Ruritanian entertainments drift away) used a nasty world where rich<br>
dictators had bodies grown and exercised for later transplant.  The kids<br>
were not decorticated (have you ever seen the kind of body that results from<br>
microcephaly?), but trained with a kind of ideology/religion that made them<br>
happily anticipate their merging with, for example, The Lady...  My point?<br>
Not just justice to my fellow sf laborers in the fields, but a pointer to a<br>
vast ream of elaborate material where many of the worst and best scenarios<br>
have long since been amusingly explored.  <br>
