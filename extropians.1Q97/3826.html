<i>&gt;David Levy, an economic historian at George Mason University, has a</i><br>

<i>&gt;The paper's abstract is: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Thomas Carlyle in his "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  was apppalled that the classical British economists considered blacks</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to be fully human.  Carlyle said that economists did not understand</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that blacks could not be persuaded to work by money, they had to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  whipped.  Thus the economists' anti-racisms is the basis of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  allegation of our name, the "dismal science.</i><br>
<p>
I always heard that economics was referred to as "the dismal science"<br>
because it was associated early on with Malthus's doctrines of increasing<br>
scarcity of resources and the inevitability of poverty. From the above<br>
quote, it's not clear that even from the racist's viewpoint economics would<br>
be "dismal" unless the word meant something different then.<br>
