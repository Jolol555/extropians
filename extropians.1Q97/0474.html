Yes, but as John Clark just pointed out, governments have killed far more<br>
people (usually their own citizens) this century than amateur murders. <br>
Hence governments are the very last people who should be allowed to<br>
develop these technologies, yet they are also the ones who would be<br>
enforcing this ban. <br>
<p>
This argument is basically equivalent to the US government's arguments in<br>
favor of banning secure ecryption and most government's arguments in favor<br>
of banning weapons (can't let those irresponsible people get them). Both<br>
such arguments remove citizens' defences and increase the power of the<br>
government. <br>
<p>
To give you a simple example, should the Russian government be allowed to<br>
develop nanotech and the Chechnyans not? Or the Afghans? If the Russian<br>
government had it would have hesitated to use it against the rebels?<br>
Unlike nukes a targetted nanotech attack wouldn't have destroyed the<br>
cities they wanted to control. Who has an army large enough to enforce<br>
your ban on the Russian government? <br>
<p>
Or if you prefer, how about the US government and Vietnamese?<br>
