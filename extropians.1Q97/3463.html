I was at a family get together this weekend in Rhode Island, a 60th<br>
birthday for an uncle. i was sitting with my parents, and several uncles<br>
and aunts when the subject of cloning came up (they are all practicing<br>
Catholics). I stated that I could not understand how anyone who was<br>
pro-life could be anti-cloning, as cloning is simply one more option for<br>
creating life. <br>
<p>
They replied that cloning was not a natural act of creation, to which <br>
I asked them if they were for in vitro procedures and use of fertility<br>
drugs. They said yes. I said that those practices are not natural, and<br>
use of fertility drugs frequently causes the production of clones in the<br>
womb (commonly known as twins), and if cloning were to be outlawed, then<br>
twins, triplets, etc would have to be aborted to comply with laws.<br>
<p>
Given this, they then said that they didn't like the concept of<br>
individuals going off and having their own children and raising them as<br>
single parents (hidden message: anti-gay parenting, anti-single mother),<br>
which was in their opion enough of a reason to outlaw it. I said that<br>
the procedure would most likely be used in cases where one parent in a<br>
couple is either infertile or has a genetic trait that would cause undue<br>
suffering and hardship for the child, giving parent the option of having<br>
a clone of only one parent (the "clean" one) that they can both raise.<br>
They replied that parents can be artificially inseminated and can use<br>
surrogate mothers, to which I retorted that given the total disregard of<br>
the courts for surrogate parenting agreements, as seen in numberous<br>
custody battles in the courts, causing extensive harm emotionally and<br>
financially to the families involved, it is a better solution to keep<br>
things as much "in the family" as possible, which is what cloning can<br>
do. There would be no third party source of genetic material to<br>
complicate things legally.<br>
<p>
Given this, they agreed that cloning was indeed a pro-family<br>
reproductive option.....<br>
