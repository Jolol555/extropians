I agree with David Musick in general, and disagree in some things;<br>
here are some thoughts on the subject:<br>
<p>
  The society tries to spread the education resources evenly, and even<br>
puts more money into educating retarded people than average, and more on<br>
providing appropriate education to normal people than to "severely gifted".<br>
  It's like trying to drill for oil more where the oil isn't, "to give all<br>
lands equal chance".  They always invest money where the returns are most<br>
promising.  Except in people.  Though if the money that goes to make a<br>
mediocre accountant out of a person who has no interest or ability to<br>
learn math, went instead to teach calculus to an able and willing child,<br>
the second of them would make money for both, and the society as a<br>
whole would be much better off. <br>
<p>
  That is to say, that the resources should be put where the abilities are.<br>
I am also convinced that the idea that everybody has great - and equal -<br>
talents, is just an egalitarian/PC myth.  People are quite different<br>
physically (where you do need standards for sexual compatibility and<br>
handling the external world); so what is the reason to think that they<br>
are identical mentally, where the standardization is less noticeable or<br>
crucial (especially since the highest rational intelligence became crucial<br>
only after the evolutionary process in humans essentially stopped).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...  The school will have a tremendous number of tools and resourses for </i><br>
<i>&gt;students to use, to create things and thus learn from experience, and as</i><br>
they <br>
<i>&gt;improve their skill at making things, they can begin selling what they make </i><br>
<i>&gt;and working with teams of other students to sell what they make and have</i><br>
their <br>
<i>&gt;own businesses, so that they can continue paying for their schooling, so</i><br>
it is <br>
<i>&gt;self-sustaining.  Creating and running one's own business would be part of</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;school and part of a much larger, life-long education.</i><br>
<p>
  Most important thing, it seems, is to give education at an early age, when<br>
one can't expect self-sufficiency.  Also, one may be able to earn money in an<br>
area different from what he wants to learn.  So in many cases coupling things<br>
may not be such a great idea.  Another option would be to work at your regular<br>
job, and listen to lectures-for-geniuses at your spare time.  You still have<br>
to have the lectures organized though, I agree.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Grades and degrees are meaningless in this type of school since each student </i><br>
<i>&gt;is responsible for acheiving the results they want, and they will be</i><br>
receiving <br>
<i>&gt;constant feedback on how well they are doing.  One doesn't need a degree to </i><br>
<i>&gt;"get a good job", since the point is to become a free agent and create one's </i><br>
<i>&gt;own business.  </i><br>
<p>
Aren't grades and degrees a feedback?  They do exactly that: say how well<br>
you are doing now, and whether the teacher thinks you learned the course.<br>
Jobs without degrees bring another issue - it turns the gifted school into<br>
an autonomous economic and political unit. Which is a whole new set of<br>
problems.<br>
<p>
  A good example of efforts in this direction is gifted children education.<br>
I have more than enough bitter experience with it in this country, especially<br>
in the Peoples Republic of Cambridge where all humans are supposedly more<br>
equal than anywhere west of China.  There are also some good things about it,<br>
and useful resources; Giftednet and TAG (Talented And Gifted) mailing lists,<br>
EPGY (Educational Program for Gifted Youth) in Stanford for remote learning,<br>
etc.  Maybe they may have other ideas on how to organize things you want.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-- We have no idea what we are capable of;  no one has ever taken themselves </i><br>
<i>&gt;to the limits of human potential. --</i><br>
<p>
  I actually think that we do have a pretty good idea; good education should<br>
make a great difference, but not miraculous - and it probably will not get<br>
implemented until strong mind-enhancing technologies come along.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Also, if we want to get more talented people in the society, there seems to<br>
be a much cheaper and faster method than any school. What are your criteria<br>
for a talented person?  IQ &gt; 160, eloquent in at least 3 languages, is able<br>
to gracefully juggle and dance, beats 99.99% of Americans in chess, handles<br>
calculus...  Set these requirements as criteria for free immigration into<br>
U.S., and you will have a long line of people at the border, asking you for<br>
a chance to utilize all those skills.  There is no government-sponsored or<br>
private effort, as far as I know, to find such people abroad, invite them<br>
in, or even just utilize the talents of those who come here by themselves.<br>
"You were the best surgeon in your country?  OK, but you don't have a license<br>
to practice here. Can't do plumbing either..."  This country doesn't seem<br>
actively interested in acquiring or supporting intelligence in any form.<br>
Which doesn't mean that a small group of talented people can't do anything<br>
useful.<br>
