<i>&gt;&gt;IMAGINATION </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     If one of you could commission an art peice, from a revered artist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;PRICE NO limit, excellence of quality no limit, and in any media you wanted</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(Either just a glorious exhaltation of transhumanism, or something later to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be used as a sketch perhaps for your uploaded artificial reality) - what kind</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of art would it be?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Starting to sound a bit like Extropic Art to me.</i><br>
<p>
(The "imagination" that is.) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What would you hang on you wall to proudly show what this is all about....</i><br>
<p>
If we hung imagination on a wall with one of those, one of those, you know,<br>
"things" that we used to use to hang artefacts on walls, (oh what are they<br>
called.)<br>
<p>
You know, those things that hold up the cardboard or similar material placed<br>
around a picture to serve as contract, along with that outer structure made<br>
up of parts fitted and joined together at the 90 degree corners, along with<br>
a piece of glass or plexiglas that is inserted on top and fitted just so to<br>
protect the artefact and ensure that it would hang just - perfectly.  <br>
<p>
Anyway ... one of those things that you could hammer into the wall to hang<br>
the artefact ... But, how could we make sure that it stayed there.  I mean,<br>
right there where we hung it?  What if it wandered off?<br>
