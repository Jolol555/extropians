<i>&gt;&gt;  Speaking as a techno musician, of both house and drum&amp;bass genres, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  have to say that you are quite right about techno not being experimental</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  in a sense.  Modern techno music is a quite narrowly constrained genre.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; All the sounds, fx, etc., are designed with people in mind who are out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; their trees on drugs.  There is a selection pressure that comes from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dance floor, via the DJ, to the music-makers, that drives us to copy what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; other people are doing that works on the dance floor</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The techno scene died because of the popularity of the DJ's in the mid</i><br>
<i>&gt;eighties. Ever since then it has been mostly dance thats been focused on.</i><br>
<i>&gt;DJ's world view is so narrow minded. Techno could be so much more, and of</i><br>
<i>&gt;course it will be again, but the last ten years has mostly been a musical</i><br>
<i>&gt;dead zone. (with some exeptions.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The whole thing is a beautiful example of 1) the free market at work,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and 2) the aesthetic notion that great art comes from tightly</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumscribed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; art forms, not rule-less free-form 'self-expression'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I find that it's a perfect example of what happens when technology makes it</i><br>
<i>&gt;too easy for thousand of people with no imagination or nothing to say to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make something that "sounds right" or seems like art.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Max, Max, you sound like a luddite, or the contemporary equivalent of one<br>
of those guitar bores who used to object to synthesized music!  Have you<br>
been out clubbing lately with your mates?  Have you taken any E or acid<br>
at a club lately? You can have no idea what's going on with techno<br>
nowadays unless you do. Millions of kids all over the world are doing<br>
just that (I can assure you the guardians of our nations' youth haven't<br>
a clue how far things have gone!), and the selection pressures I spoke of<br>
above are driving the music to psychotropic heights undreamed of back in<br>
the sixties.  DJ's are a very important part of this process, and their<br>
job is not easy. The competition in techno music is FEROCIOUS.<br>
<p>
Mind you, I gather from some American friends of mine that the club<br>
scene in the States is only just now starting to catch on in the way it<br>
has been going here in the UK  and the rest of Europe since the late 80s,<br>
and even then, only among much younger kids of very specific tribal<br>
affiliations (here in the UK the scene is all ages and cultures).<br>
<p>
As Vonnegut said, 90% of everything is crap, and there is indeed a lot<br>
of crap techno around,  but it certainly isn't the artistic desert you<br>
seem to think it is.<br>
<p>
(Oh and puh-leeze don't give me any of that "But what sort of music is<br>
it if you need to take drugs to get into it?" shit.  I love good guitar<br>
music, I love classic techno of the sort you like, I like music that goes<br>
without drugs too - jazz, 'classical'.  Modern techno is music designed<br>
for people on drugs in a specific environment, and you won't understand<br>
it, or be able to appreciate it at home on your hifi or on the radio<br>
unless you have gotten into it in those circumstances. That's the reality,<br>
take it or leave it.)<br>
