Your virtues are legendary and greatly admired.  It's truly a pity that <br>

<i>&gt; &gt;From "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" 3/8/95:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Quotes from Elliott Sober's "Philosophy of Biology"  (1993):</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   "Popper's criterion of falsifiability requires that we be able to single</i><br>
<i>&gt; out a special class of sentences and call them observation sentences.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposition is then said to be falsifiable precisely when it is related to</i><br>
<i>&gt; observation sentences in a special way:  Proposition P is falsifiable if</i><br>
<i>&gt; and only if P deductively implies at least one observation sentence O.  One</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem with Popper's proposal is that it requires that the distinction</i><br>
<i>&gt; between observation statements and other statements be made precise.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; check the statement 'The chicken is dead,' you must know what a chicken is</i><br>
<i>&gt; and what death is.  *This problem is sometimes expressed by saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt; observation is theory laden.*   Every claim that people make about what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they observe depends for its justification on their possessing prior</i><br>
<i>&gt; information.  Popper addresses this problem by saying that what one regards</i><br>
<i>&gt; as an observation statement is a matter of convention.  But this solution</i><br>
<i>&gt; will hardly help one tell, in a problematic case, whether a statement is</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiable.  For Popper's criterion to have some bite, there must be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonarbitrary way to distinguish observation sentences from the rest.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; date, no one has managed to do this in a satisfactory manner.</i><br>
<p>
This is a linguistic problem, not a scientific/logical one.  To communicate<br>
at all we have to use a bunch of arbitrary conventions.  It's part of<br>
having a common language.  But once we have those in place, we can talk<br>
of falsifiable statements.  Sober speaks as though conventions had to<br>
be invented anew with every conversation.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;   The problems with Popper's falsifiability criterion go deeper.  First,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is the so-called tacking problem.  Suppose that some proposition S is</i><br>
<i>&gt; falsifiable.  It immediately follows that the conjunction of S and any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other proposition N is falsifiable as well.  That is, if S makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; predictions that can be checked observationally, so does the conjunction S</i><br>
<i>&gt; &amp; N.  This is an embarrassment to Popper's proposal since he wanted that</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposal to separate nonscientific propositions N from properly scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; propositions S.  Presumably, if N is not scientifically respectable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; neither is S &amp; N.  The falsifiability criterion does not obey this</i><br>
<i>&gt; plausible requirement.</i><br>
<p>
There is nothing inherently plausible here.  Indeed, the fact that N _can_<br>
corrupt S is yet another demonstration of the difference between N and S.<br>
( Compare to the proposition 'S1 and S2' )<br>
<p>
{ It's dinner time here.  Sober's 3rd and 4th errors will be addressed<br>
  after dessert }<br>
