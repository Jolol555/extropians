<i>&gt; I know Galois died very young, but that's no excuse, as you say </i><br>
<i>&gt; the proof is in the accomplishment and I think George Cantor was </i><br>
<i>&gt; at least his equal.  I also  think you've underrepresented the 20'th </i><br>
<i>&gt; century, I would certainly add Kurt Godel and Alan Turing to your </i><br>
<i>&gt; A list of giants.</i><br>
<p>
That's a defensible point of view.  Naturally you would emphasize <br>
set theory more than I would.  Many questions could be raised about <br>
who belongs on the A list.  If I'm going to put Lagrange on the list, <br>
why not Laplace?  Why not Fourier?  Does Galois really belong?  <br>
If I'm going to include Weierstrass, why not Hilbert?  Why not <br>
von Neumann?  These are all fair questions, certainly.  It might be fun <br>
to argue about this, but I've just about written myself out for the <br>
moment. <br>
<p>
In any case, such questions have no effect whatever on the original <br>
point.  <br>

<i>&gt; On the topic of women and achievement ( or genius) : for an </i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting  look at women and men and why and how they attain </i><br>
<i>&gt; their accomplishments, I suggest renting the movie Camille Claudel, </i><br>
<i>&gt; a sculptress who was certainly more "gifted" - and certainly worked </i><br>
<i>&gt; hard  as Rodin (even coughed up some blood - just to please LYLE) </i><br>
<i>&gt; but became known only as his mistress, despite the fact that he stole </i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot of her ideas and techniques - he was a better business man </i><br>
<i>&gt; and better at running his life. And he had a wife to do his laundry and</i><br>
<i>&gt; make his house for him.  ; ) </i><br>
<p>
I saw that movie several years ago, when it played at the NUART.  <br>
(Yes, they let people like me into the NUART, as long as we behave <br>
ourselves, but only on Tuesday night --"Neanderthal Night."  After the <br>
movie, we go home and listen to the Psychotechnics show on KXLU.)  <br>
<p>
Who would deny that some women have great talent?  Lisa Gerrard is <br>
an obvious contemporary example.  Also Ayn Rand, Lili Riefensthal, <br>
Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Hildegard von Bingen, Sappho...  from <br>
ancient times to the present, there have been such women.  Likewise, <br>
who would deny that there have been women like Camille Claudel, <br>
who get taken advantage of by men?  It happens in science, too.  <br>
There was a woman who helped Watson and Crick with the discovery <br>
of DNA.  She didn't get the Nobel Prize she deserved.  And now I <br>
can't even think of her name...  no doubt about it, life is not fair.  <br>
<p>
But this has no effect on the original point, either.  <br>
<p>
The relationship of Rodin and Claudel is not a typical example of <br>
how geniuses attain their accomplishments.  Most geniuses don't <br>
steal their ideas from women.  <br>

<i>&gt; What is it about male supremacists that they take male intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; superiority for *granted*, as if *we* had something to prove?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why isn't the default hypothesis that *females* are of superior </i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These people (de Garis and Wiik) aren't even bothering to argue.  </i><br>
<p>
I think they were assuming that you had some experience of life, and <br>
some knowledge of the history of science, in which case their point <br>
would indeed be obvious.  Experience will only come with time, <br>
but I have given you the basic facts about who the geniuses are in <br>
one field, mathematics.  The facts about other fields are similar. I am <br>
bothering to argue, and I would be interested to see your response.  <br>
"How does one rotate one's finger about one's ear in ASCII? "  isn't <br>
going to cut it.  <br>
It is your assertions, not mine, that fly in the face of <br>
common sense.   You are the one who has something to prove.  <br>
