Yes, this might be ideal.  Key word: 'ideal'.  What will actually<br>
happen?  History and theory suggest that a small government will try <br>
to turn into a big government.  The US Constitution wasn't that bad, but<br>
we've drifted out of it.  Maybe it needed bigger letters.  "AND CONGRESS<br>

Well, la.  The unflawed system is one where everyone does what I want,<br>
as John Clark says.  Unflawed for me, that is.  Alas, you all seem to<br>
have other plans.  Thesis: a universe with finite access to resoures and<br>
more than one independent actor cannot reach political utopia.<br>

Moderate social measures have a history of multiplying beyond the<br>

Alas, who gets to define the crisis?  I do have an attraction to the<br>
Roman system, though, I don't know why.  The oddities of having 2<br>
consuls, as well as tribunes with veto powers, perhaps.  Also the fact<br>
that they had one-year terms.  Perhaps such a system wouldn't be so bad.<br>

Paranoia is what the lazy call wisdom.<br>
<p>
(Doh.  Now I know why this confuses people -- English syntax actually<br>
seems ambiguous.  What I mean is that lazy people refer to wise<br>
self-defense as paranoia.  But now I'm not sure whether the line says<br>
that, or whether it's saying the lazy refer to paranoia as wisdom, which<br>
would be confusing.  Help?)<br>
