The market caters to the local supplies and demands of suppliers <br>
and customers, about which these parties know a great deal.<br>
The market operates in what Covey calls the "circle of influence",<br>
while ignoring idealistic but ignorant desires about what the global<br>
state of the world "should be".  These idealistic global desired<br>
states are what critics of the market refer to when they say that the<br>
market is not producing what people really want or need, or what "should"<br>
be produced.  For conditions of which customers and suppliers actually <br>
have great and unique knowledge, the market is bringing about desired <br>
states vastly more often than the critics can imagine, or could bring <br>
about in any globally planned way.<br>
<p>
Academics misunderstand and often despise markets for two major reasons:<br>
+ They think in a manner with implicit pretense of omniscience,<br>
discounting local knowledge as prejudice to be eliminated.<br>
+ They tend to be funded by governments.<br>
<p>
Local knowledge can be perhaps compared to mass, while voluntary<br>
contract and the price system is analogous to gravitaional attraction<br>
in converting local conditions into global order.  Price communicates<br>
local knowledge and free local ethical values in the highly compressed, <br>
efficient form of a shared value scale.<br>
<p>
When one of these global desires is so compelling and rational, <br>
but obviously unmet, we look for a public goods problem: a <br>
situation where supply of a good is not undertaken because free riders<br>
cannot be excluded.  <br>
