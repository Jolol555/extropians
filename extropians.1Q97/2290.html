Article in this weeks New Scientist (8th Feb'97 pp32-36) on a class of <br>
neurochemicals called ampakines (of which there are several hundred. Work <br>
done at University of California at Irivne by Gary Lynch and Gary Rogers <br>
has confirmed substantial enhancement of learning in older rodents. Even <br>
better, human tests have already begun, and initial reports indicate 20% <br>
increases in short-term recall for men in their 20s, and increases of <br>
over 50% in people over 60. Long term recall is also apparently enhanced, <br>
but no figures are quoted. Further, there is a good explanation of the  <br>
mechanism, which could lead to improved compounds in the future.<br>
<p>
I suspect there will be more info at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com">http://www.newscientist.com</a> in a <br>
couple of days (it lags a bit behind the dead-tree edition for commercial <br>
reasons).<br>
