<i>&gt; A computer cannot say something feels good in the way I can say such. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; can analyze data inputted to it and come to the purely abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion that according to all its data this incoming data should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered a "good" feeling. But it is not feeling the data. It is just</i><br>
<i>&gt; running subroutines and more subroutines. All the computer has done is</i><br>
<i>&gt; label the data. It has given the data a name and that is it. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer can then be programmed to blow bells and whistles but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer will in no way ENJOY blowing bells and whistles. It just does</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. There is no way I could scare my computer, there is no way I could</i><br>
<i>&gt; anger my computer, there is no way I could embarass my computer, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is no way I can give my computer pleasure or pain, no matter what data I</i><br>
<i>&gt; send it or in what fashion I handle it. How is this so difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand? </i><br>
<p>
In what objectively demonstrable way does what you have just described<br>
not apply word-for-word to a human brain?  I may concede that /your/<br>
computer on your desk now might not experience fear or joy, but to<br>
blindly assume that such experiences /cannot/ be experienced by a more<br>
powerful computer in /exactly/ the way I do is to postulate that my<br>
brain is something other than the mechanical process that occurs in it--<br>
in other words, that's tantamount to dualism, and other mystical bunk.<br>
<p>
I know that I feel.  I experience it directly.  It would be outrageously<br>
arrogant of me to assume that my particular bizarre construction of<br>
proteins was somehow more capable of that than a similarly-powered<br>
organism implemented in semiconductors.<br>
