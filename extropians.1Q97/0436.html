<i>&gt;As Chris said, downloading into a physical drone is the obvious solution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I wonder how many uploads would be willing to take the risk of</i><br>
<i>&gt;downloading into a potentially untrustworthy physical body when they could</i><br>
<i>&gt;sit safely inside their own computer at home. You can encrypt yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;while you pass across the network, but who knows what 'Kangaroo</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rent-a-bod' will do with you when you get there? Your competitors or</i><br>
<i>&gt;enemies might pay a lot of money for a copy of your software[1]. </i><br>
<p>
Then simply install a controller implant in the biological drone's cranium<br>
and control it remotely. Just imagine how fun it would be to control a<br>
person running around using a RC car controller. Also safety remains in the<br>
free market and encryption. Keep yourself encrypted at all times using<br>
strong public key cryptography for safety to communicate data back and<br>
forth but remain on one of a couple supercomputers paying to keep it<br>
maintained and running like an apartment or have nanites maintain it. You<br>
wouldn't leap from computer to computer, you'd access everything just as<br>
you do now by pulling it off the net or recieveing it in streams. Your<br>
biological drone could be automated as well when you're not using it to<br>
auto feed and water itself,go to the restroom, and exercise on it's own.<br>
You could upload your consciousness to your own biological drone or<br>
previous body and if you failed to maintain the implant controller with<br>
newer hardware when it gets old and begins to deteriorate and the harddrive<br>
crashes, the data recovery team will pop open the drone's skull and take<br>
out the controller implant and attempt to recover as much as they can of<br>
you. So there is a future in data recovery for sure!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;its possible now to do many of the exploration and exploitation concepts</i><br>
<i>&gt;we have for this solar system. however it is not "cost effective" from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;commercial standpoint at the present time due to the inefficiency of</i><br>
<i>&gt;chemical rocket propulsion.</i><br>
<p>
Thank atheism that there is a renewed interest in space! My parents force<br>
me to go to church with them in their vain attempts to "save my soul" but I<br>
actually listened to the sermon this time when the pastor went on praising<br>
the renewed interests in space before the congregation. I was thrilled that<br>
he was spreading such a great meme. Maybe the only way to get anything<br>
around here accomplished is either by media directing the mindless masses<br>
or by stating its in God's will.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If uploading becomes widely possible, affordable, and popular, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt;market for full sensory capable drones will be sufficient to warrant</i><br>
<i>&gt;their development, but probably not before, unless VR sex becomes even</i><br>
<i>&gt;more widely popular.</i><br>
<p>
You can bet the military will be the first ones to fuck with human DNA to<br>
make the ultimate genengineered remote controlled soldier. If the military<br>
is gaining an interest in this already, it's not too far off at all.<br>
