[Lorrey asks:]<br>
<i>&gt; If you don't need to hit it with a photon, then you aren't restricted b=</i><br>
y<br>
<i>&gt; the speed of light are you?</i><br>
<p>
Sure you do.  The way it works is that you "could have" hit it with a<br>
photon, but you "didn't really" hit it with a photon.  For those readers<br>
who do not savvy quantum counterfactuals, the five-minute explanation of<br>
the basic counterfactual split-photon experiment:<br>
<p>
                 1          =<br>
<p>
<i>                 |           Arrows indicate direction. =</i><br>
<p>
       A/--------/---2       A single photon leaves START,<br>
<i>        |       D|           and is reflected from mirrors. =</i><br>
<p>
<i>        |C       |           What is the chance that the photon</i><br>
START---/--------/B          will reach target 1, or target 2? =<br>
<p>
<p>
There are four mirrors: {A, B, C, D}.  {A, B} are "fully silvered"<br>
mirrors:  They always reflect a photon.  {C, D} are "half-silvered"<br>
mirrors:  They reflect a photon 50% of the time.<br>
<p>
Under "classical" physics, the sort we're used to seeing, the photon has<br>
a 50% chance of being reflected from C.  If reflected from C, it will<br>
bounce off A and thus reach D.  Now we roll the dice again:  It has a<br>
50% chance of being reflected again and reaching 1, and a 50% chance of<br>
reaching 2.  Thus, since the photon only has a 50% chance of going down<br>
path A (the path intercepted by mirror A), the total contribution of<br>
path a is a 25% chance of reaching 1 and a 25% chance of reaching 2.<br>
<p>
Path B is likewise.  The photon has a 50% chance of going down path B. =<br>
<p>
Then it reaches mirror D and has a 50% chance of being reflected and<br>
reaching 2, and a 50% chance of continuing to 1.  So path B contributes<br>
a 25% chance of reaching 1 and a 25% chance of reaching 2.<br>
<p>
Summing up the contributions, we find that the chance of reaching 1 is<br>
(25% + 25% =3D 50%), and that of reaching 2 is (25% + 25% =3D 50%).  Thus=<br>
,<br>
under classical physics, a photon has an equal chance of reaching A or<br>
B.<br>
<p>
Quantum physics is different, and weirder.  Probabilities in quantum<br>
physics are measured by complex numbers, of the form (a + bi).  Now we<br>
perform the calculation again, but this time, mirrors not only change<br>
the *path* of the photon - assuming they reflect it - but they also<br>
change the *phase* of the photon by 90=B0 or a quarter-turn.  In practice=<br>
,<br>
they multiply the probability of the photon being in a particular place<br>
by i, the square root of negative one.  What this all means will soon<br>
become clear.<br>
<p>
Now recalculate the probabilities.  A photon is emitted from START, with<br>
a probability of 1, or 1 + 0i, of being there.  It hits mirror C.  Now<br>
the photon has (1 + 0i)*(i)=3D(0 + i) or i "probability" of going down<br>
path A, and a 1 "probability" of going down path B.  In the branch of<br>
reality in which the photon goes down path A, the photon hits the mirror<br>
A and reflects again, so the photon now has an (i)*(i)=3D(-1) quantum<br>
"probability" of getting to D.  The photon hits D and "splits" again,<br>
part of it getting to target 2 (without being reflected) with a<br>
"probability" of -1, and part hitting target 1 with a "probability" of<br>
-i.  So far, therefore, the photon has a -1 "probability" of being at<br>
target 2 and a -i "probability" of being at target 1.<br>
<p>
Interlude:  The reason "probability" has quotes around it is because<br>
there is no such thing of a -50% chance of something happening.  In<br>
quantum physics these are called probability amplitudes.  We will soon<br>
see how probability amplitudes are converted to genuine, normal,<br>
positive, real, probabilities.  But for now, don't be concerned by<br>
probabilities like -1.<br>
<p>
Now let's continue with the branch of reality in which the photon goes<br>
down path B, with a probability of 1.  It gets reflected by B, and<br>
continues with a probability of i.  It gets to D.  Along one branch, it<br>
is not reflected and gets to target 1 with a probability of i.  Along<br>
another branch, it is reflected and gets to target 2 with a probability<br>
of (i)*(i)=3D(-1).  So for branch B, the contributions are an i<br>
probability of getting to target 1 and a -1 probability of getting to<br>
target 2.<br>
<p>
Now we sum the branches of reality, just like with normal<br>
probabilities.  Branch A gives a -i probability of getting to target 1,<br>
and branch B gives an i probability.  i + -i equals 0.  They cancel<br>
out.  There is probability amplitude zero of getting to target 1. =<br>
<p>
Branch A and branch B both give -1 probability amplitude of the photon<br>
getting to target 2.  -1 + -1 =3D -2, for a -2 probability amplitude of<br>
the photon getting to 2.<br>
<p>
Now convert probability amplitudes to probabilities.  This we do by<br>
taking the "squared modulus", which for a complex number (a + bi), is<br>
equal to a squared plus b squared, or (a * a) + (b * b).  The chance of<br>
getting to target 1 is 0, or zero squared plus zero squared.  The chance<br>
of getting to target 2 is 4, or -2 squared plus zero squared.  4 chances<br>
of getting to target 2, 0 chances of getting to target 1, so there's a<br>
100% chance of getting to target 2.<br>
<p>
That is, quantum physics says that instead of a 50% chance of getting to<br>
either target, every single photon "splits" into two separate branches<br>
of reality, goes down *both* paths, *interferes* with *itself*, and<br>
winds up at target 2.<br>
<p>
But suppose we remove mirror C, so that all photons go down path B?  Or<br>
suppose we place a rock in the middle of path A?  Then the two paths no<br>
longer cancel out.  There's an i probability of getting to target 1, for<br>
a (1*1) or 1 chance of getting there.  There's a -1 probability of<br>
getting to target 2, or (-1*-1)=3D1 chance of getting there.  A 50% chanc=<br>
e<br>
of getting to either target.<br>
<p>
What's worse, just *measuring* the photon will influence the probability<br>
that it gets to its target - even if it doesn't deflect the photon by so<br>
much as an inch.  Because when you measure a system, all probability<br>
amplitudes are *immediately* converted to probabilities and the system<br>
"collapses" or is "reduced" to a single branch of reality.  The photon<br>
is suddenly in only one place in only one branch of reality.  This is<br>
known as "the collapse of the wavefunction" or "state-vector reduction".<br>
<p>
So if we replace mirror A with a "measuring device" that reflects the<br>
photon as usual, but also lights up a little device that says the photon<br>
has passed, the photon has a 50% chance of reaching target 1 or 2, just<br>
like in classical physics.  Because when mirror A measures the system -<br>
when hit by a photon in the branch of reality where the photon goes down<br>
path A - the system is "reduced".  The photon has an i probability of<br>
being on path A, and a 1 probability of being on path B.  Squared<br>
amplitudes - 1 chance A, 1 chance B.  So the photon will wind up on<br>
either A or B with a 50% chance - but not on both A and B with i and 1<br>
probability.  There are no longer two branches of reality.  The photon<br>
does split again when it reaches target 1 or target 2, but it has a -1<br>
probability for 1 and an i probability for 2, which works out to 50/50<br>
again.<br>
<p>
As you'll recall from way back in the beginning, you can use this trick<br>
to observe an object without touching it.  Take the Elitzur-Vaidman<br>
bomb-testing problem.  We have been supplied with a large number of<br>
bombs, with detonators so sensitive that a single photon reflecting from<br>
one will set off the bomb.  The problem is that most of our bombs are<br>
duds.  The detonating mechanism doesn't work.  And it's impossible to<br>
test the detonating mechanism without reflecting a photon from it. =<br>
<p>
Question:  How do you produce a bomb that is guaranteed to work...<br>
without blowing yourself up?<br>
<p>
Answer:  This problem, as presented, is *impossible* in classical<br>
physics.  But quantum physics can provide a solution. =<br>
<p>
<p>
Replace mirror A... with a bomb.  Since the bomb constitutes a<br>
"measuring instrument" - that is, it blows up if a photon strikes it,<br>
but doesn't blow up otherwise - the photon now has a chance of<br>
reflecting off B, and winding up at target 1.  (And an equal chance of<br>
reaching target 2... and of course it's only 50% that it reaches<br>
*either* target instead of blowing up the bomb.)<br>
<p>
Thus we can determine whether the bomb is a measuring instrument<br>
*without* *even* *touching* *it*!  However, although you can measure<br>
something without a photon having touched it in that branch of reality<br>
which turns out to be real, it still has to be possible that the photon<br>
*could* have touched it, or rather it has to be the case that the photon<br>
*did* touch it in an alternate branch of reality.  Thus this trick does<br>
not, Mike Lorrey, constitute FTL.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you have a photon that is 'locked' to the one<br>
inside the system, but in another galaxy, measuring the Andromeda photon<br>
will cause the photon in the experimental apparatus to collapse as<br>
well.  Once collapsed, it has a chance of reaching target 1, which it<br>
did not have before.  Thus if you can achieve this sort of 'lock',<br>
which, as I understand, you can - using the recent discovery as reported<br>
in SciAm, you can synchronize the quantum states of large numbers of<br>
photons - you have instantaneous communication, somebody wins a Nobel<br>
Prize, and all hell breaks loose in the field of physics.<br>
<p>
Even if you can't 'lock' photons, the experimentally confirmed Bell<br>
inequalities demonstrate that performing a *particlar* measurement can<br>
influence the outcome of another measurement performed on the other side<br>
of the galaxy.  There are various reasons why you can't use Bell to<br>
transmit information, but any way you look it at, quantum mechanics and<br>
relativity are having screaming catfights.<br>
<p>
I hope that cleared everything up.<br>
