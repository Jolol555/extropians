<p>
You are very mistaken.<br>
<p>
The systems people are worried about are not PCs.  The *real* problem only<br>
really manifests itself in old mainframe systems and older, large database<br>
systems (like the IRS?).  In some mainframe cases, the problems are caused<br>
at a very low level and would essentially require replacement.<br>
<p>
The biggest problem is software where dates were hardcoded with a two-digit<br>
year.  In some systems, this was the only way it could be done at the time.<br>
The result is that *a lot* of program logic will become invalid when the<br>
year 2000 rolls over.  It has already been accepted that for some<br>
companies/agencies and systems, there is physically not enough time left to<br>
do the necessary conversions/modifications.  The number of lines of affected<br>
code is absolutely enormous.  There aren't enough available programmers to<br>
tackle the problem, and companies that were created specifically to<br>
specialize in this area are making MILLIONS.<br>
<p>
The year 2000 will bring a lot of big database and mainframe software<br>
systems to their knees, due mostly to the unresponsiveness of organizations<br>
to the immediate nature of the problem.  Whether or not the IRS will be one<br>
of the victims remains to be seen.  In any case, the world will not come to<br>
an end as we know it.  To most people, it will most likely manifest itself<br>
as occasional short-term inconveniences, inefficiencies, and inaccuracies<br>
that will disappear after a year or two.  <br>
<p>
You will probably see the same type of problem occur a few decades into the<br>
21st century when 32-bit epoch time rolls over, but probably not as serious.    <br>
