<i>&gt; In this dialogue you seem to be fond of putting words in my mouth, once you</i><br>
<i>&gt; told me I was telling you to seek mystical nonsense, now you claim that I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling you NOT to push buttons, I did not say that, why did you "hear" that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you might want to look at that. </i><br>
<p>
I probably am misinterpreting your real beliefs as badly as you seem to<br>
misinterpret mine, but that is a danger of ambiguous language.  I strive<br>
to use words as clearly as I can with their generally accepted meanings,<br>
and I honestly try to interpret yours the same way.  Certainly, our<br>
differing backgrounds may lead us to use such common words differently,<br>
which is why I like to use concrete examples such as my friend talking<br>
to his mother, and analogies like the computer network.<br>
<p>
If you think I misinterpret your words, rephrase them, define them,<br>
exemplify them.  I'll try to understand, but if my best attempt at<br>
doing so evaluates them as nonsense, don't expect me to hesitate in<br>
saying so.<br>
