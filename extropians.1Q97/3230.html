From: hanson@hss.caltech.edu (Robin Hanson)<br>
<i>&gt; Yes.  As a young nerd I was sure my social habits were the direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; application of fundamental principles I held dear regarding social</i><br>
<i>&gt; status, etc.  Now as an older nerd, I can see how insensitive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-absorbed I was.  There was real social injustice I was reacting</i><br>
<i>&gt; to, but that was not a good excuse.</i><br>
<p>
I have moved in the opposite direction.  When I was younger I engaged in<br>
a constant struggle against my natural introversion in order to meet<br>
people, make friends, etc.  I worked hard to overcome the "nerd" image,<br>
to fit in with ordinary people.  It was reasonably successful but it was<br>
very stressful for me.<br>
<p>
In recent years I have adopted a more complacent attitude.  I am who I am,<br>
and I am no longer so interested in pretending to be something else.  If I<br>
share no interests in common with my neighbors, I don't try to spend time<br>
with them chatting about sports and cars.<br>
<p>
You can look at this either as a flaw, that I am taking the easy road and<br>
just doing what feels natural, or as a strength, that I am satisified<br>
with my own self-assessment and no longer feel the need to become what<br>
society expects.  The "Fourth Turning" book did put a different spin<br>
on it, though, suggesting that my attitude could lead to trouble in a<br>
few years.<br>
