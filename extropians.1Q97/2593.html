I think you raise a valid point -- many Extropians oppose the naturalistic<br>
fallacy ("it's natural, so it must be good"), and rightly so in my opinion.<br>
However, it may be that we commit at least one instance of it by assuming<br>
that life (or at least, *our* lives, are worth preserving -- we're<br>
pandering to the survival instinct ;-&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I myself have had no fear of death yet, and the only reason for myself i</i><br>

<i>&gt;be 'around'. I find it hard to understand why anyone would stay alive for</i><br>
<i>&gt;selfish reasons, but i assume there are many who would. </i><br>
<p>
But isn't wanting to "stay around" to look after one's family  firmly in<br>
line with what Nature (our genes) want us to do?<br>
<p>
For me, much of life's attraction stems from the belief that the universe<br>
can be a wonderful place to experience and interact with. Is this selfish,<br>
in the bad sense of the word?  Possibly, but I figure much of the<br>
accusations of "selfishness" directed at people who want to extend their<br>
life spans stem from the naturalistic fallacy. We're accustomed to a ~100<br>
year life-span being "natural", and attempts to exceed that may rankle<br>
(some people, definitely not me!). But this is just an artifact of our<br>
genetic programming: few would argue that a 50 year-old who has raised<br>
his/her children to maturity is selfish for wanting to live another 30 odd<br>
years. Similarly, if the maximum human lifespan were 500 years, those who<br>
committed suicide at age 300 so as "not to be selfish" would probably be<br>
seen as very odd indeed.<br>
<p>
That being said, if I were some sort of vampire-like creature that had to<br>
kill or hurt innocent people in order to survive, then accusations of<br>
selfishness would be better-founded. But if someone continues to interact<br>
with others in a manner that is acceptable to those involved, why shouldn't<br>
they be able to strive for an indefinite life span?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;My personal reason for striving towards a posthuman state is to eliminate</i><br>
<i>&gt;the 'control' nature imposes on the living individual. To put that control</i><br>
<i>&gt;(over my life, death, emotions) more into the hands of the individual.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely.<br>
