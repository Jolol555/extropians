About 1966 or so, a NASA team doing work for the Apollo moon mission took the<br>
astronauts near Tuba City where the terrain of the Navajo Reservation looks<br>
very much like the Lunar surface.  Along with all the trucks and large<br>
vehicles, there were two large figures dressed in full Lunar spacesuits.<br>
<p>
Nearby a Navajo sheep herder and his son were watching the strange creatures<br>
walk about, occasionally being tended by personnel.  The two Navajo people<br>
were noticed and approached by the NASA personnel.  Since the man did not<br>
know English, his son asked for him what the strange creatures were and the<br>
NASA people told them that they are just men that are getting ready to go to<br>
the moon.  The man became very excited and asked if he could send a message<br>
to the moon with the astronauts.<br>
<p>
The NASA personnel thought this was a great idea so they rustled up a tape<br>
recorder.  After the man gave them his message, they asked his son to<br>
translate.  His son would not.<br>
<p>
Later, they tried a few more people on the reservation to translate and every<br>
person they asked would chuckle and then refuse to translate.  Finally, with<br>
cash in hand, someone translated the message, "Watch out for these guys, they<br>
come to take your land."<br>
