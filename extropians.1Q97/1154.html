<i>&gt;     Some of the stuff about trajectory computation, release timing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and so on, was possibly well developed long before Lucy and her kin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They likely stemmed from arboreal predecessors, who had occasion to</i><br>
<i>&gt; leap around in the treetops, in the manner of modern monkeys: Missing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the branch you jump for has low survival value.  A variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt; present-day arboreal animals with much smaller brains than Lucy handle</i><br>
<i>&gt; projectile-hurling over distances of several meters tolerably well --</i><br>
<i>&gt; they themselves being the projectiles.  The common local example is</i><br>
<i>&gt; (*ahem*) squirrels.</i><br>
<p>
For some reason, perhaps the lenght of time this behavior has been<br>
wired into the nervous system, I think body motions may take less<br>
computation, or perhaps I mean the computation is more distributed.<br>
Accurate throwing takes accurate motion sequencing, and the motion <br>
is over in too short a time to get corrective feedback, i.e., the<br>
whole thing is driven off a sequencer located in the (?) pre-motor<br>
cortex.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;     There is a subtle point on using weaponry to drive off predators</i><br>
<i>&gt; that may not have come up yet.  To defend against a predator does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; require that one kill or injure the predator, or even that one have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly high probability of doing so.  It merely requires that</i><br>
<i>&gt; one make the risk to the predator, of pressing home an attack,</i><br>
<i>&gt; unacceptable.</i><br>
<p>
Excellent points.  Dogs fear rocks, even if the chances of one being<br>
seriously hurt by a rock are not high (though once I knocked a dog out<br>
with a thrown object).  Chimps throw things at preditors today, and this<br>
might well have been the origin of a preditor discoraging method used by<br>
Lucy and Co.  Projectiles hitting lions or similar at a distance might<br>
trigger the idea that if they are being hurt this far out, getting closer<br>
is a really bad idea.  Of course, being bipedal makes it a lot easier to<br>
throw things, so the possiblity exist that being being ready to throw was<br>
important enough to make a difference.  Rocks moved by people (manuports?)<br>
are older than chipped rocks I think, but I don't have a reference at<br>
hand. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Consider an hypothetical predator that takes one large animal-prey</i><br>
<i>&gt; per week, that starts doing so at age six months, and that attains</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexual maturity some time between two and three years of age.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; 100 prey encounters before the animal gets a chance to pass on its</i><br>
<i>&gt; genes.  Even an encounter with prey whose only immediate effect is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; injure the predator, may result in its subsequent death, either from</i><br>
<i>&gt; starvation because of reduced ability to hunt, or from being preyed</i><br>
<i>&gt; upon.  Thus if the average risk of even moderate injury, per prey</i><br>
<i>&gt; encounter, is as high as one percent, it is more than likely that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; predator will be out of the gene pool before reproducing.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Hence, as long as there are alternate prey animals, it doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; take a highly lethal defense to deter predators.  We have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; situation, paradoxical at first sight, that even a prey species that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be very likely to lose in a fight to the death with a predator,</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be able to deter that predator by virtue of the small chance of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; different outcome.  After all, the predators aren't out for fights to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the death as such, all they want is lunch.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
