<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"that book" predicts otherwise.  Why do you hate it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exactly what you said. It's a bleak depressing look at the future. It's an</i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting concept but there are multiple things the book hasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;meantioned that occurred but didn't fit into their meme. Besides each past</i><br>
<i>&gt;generation has had to become accustomed to the trends of the new. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;spiritual Awakening turn will not solve the problems meantioned in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;unraveling.  ... Catastrophic</i><br>
<i>&gt;events occur but they aren't linked to social behaviors.  ... If this</i><br>
<i>&gt;pattern were true, different societies all around the world would be in</i><br>
<i>&gt;different turns altogether due to cultural differences. How these turns</i><br>
<i>&gt;might interact could bring about different eras if this were true. But they</i><br>
<i>&gt;claim that all of society runs on this central clock. How do they explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;this? Celestial influences? Sunspots? ... It's trash.</i><br>
<p>
I really think you need to understand something at at least a basic<br>
level before you can reject it this strongly.  Strauss &amp; Howe do give<br>
a plausible causal influence story, they don't try to explain<br>
everything, they do address geographic variation, and whether<br>
something depresses you is no indication of whether it is true.<br>
Please either learn the basics here or say you don't know.<br>
