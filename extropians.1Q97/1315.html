<p>
Whoa, I think there's a big jump when going from 'feeling that we have free<br>
will' to 'actually having free will'.  Admittedly both concpets have their <br>
place in the discussion of the subject, but confusion seems like the most <br>
likely result if we mix them up in our analysis.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Von Neumann's proof against determinism is long since dead, not only</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;has the many worlds interpretation bypassed its logic, but Bell</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;discovered in the 60s that it contained a mathematical blunder such</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that it only rules out determinism if reality operates by strictly</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;local rules (Or in more modern terms, in a reality without the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;advanced action Chalmers talks about).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Von Neumann was a very great mathematician, I don't think the man was capable</i><br>
<i>&gt; of making a mathematical blunder even if he wanted to, however Von Neumann</i><br>
<i>&gt; was not a great physicists, his mistake was physical not mathematical.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, his blunder was mathematical not physical.  Specifically he applied the<br>
average of a set to the individual members of that set when doing his mathe-<br>
matical proof.  The error was discovered in 1935, by mathematician Grete<br>
Hermann, but was ignored in the scientific community for over 30 additional<br>
years until John Bell rediscovered the error in 1966.  In the words of John<br>
Bell himself:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Von Neumann proof, if you actually come to grips with it, falls apart</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your hands!  There is nothing to it.  It's not just flawed, it's silly!...</i><br>
<i>&gt; When you translate [his assumptions] into terms of physical disposition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're nonsense.  You may quote me on that:  The proof of Von Neumann is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not merely false, but foolish!</i><br>
<p>
The quote comes from an interview in Omni magazine in May 1988 on page 88.<br>
A copy of it and the relevant discussion can be found in John Gribbin's book<br>
'Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality' on page 155.  It is surely<br>
a cautionary tale of the human propensity for "group think", something which<br>
John Gribbin goes on to address by paraphrasing David Mermin's 1993 article<br>
from the 'Reviews of Modern Physics #65 (1993) page 803:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Writing in 1993, David Mermin referred to the generations of graduate </i><br>
<i>&gt; students who might have been tempted to construct hidden-variables</i><br>
<i>&gt; theories but had been 'beaten into submission' by the claim that von</i><br>
<i>&gt; Neumann had proved that it could not be done.  He said that von </i><br>
<i>&gt; Neumann's 'no-hidden-variables proof' was based on an assumption so</i><br>
<i>&gt; silly 'that one is led to wonder whether the proof was ever studied</i><br>
<i>&gt; by either the students or those who appealed to it to rescue them</i><br>
<i>&gt; from speculative adventures' in the realms of quantum interpretation.</i><br>
<p>
Gribbin goes on to point out: "that physicists can be just as gullible<br>
as anyone else in accepting an idea because 'everybody knows' that it<br>
is true", which brings us back to the subject of "free will" where you<br>
go on to say:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At any rate, I don't think the question of determinism has much to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt; free will because even if the universe is completely deterministic (and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that it is) it would still not be predictable, and I'm not just talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about practical concerns and chaos theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I think the best guidance on this subject doesn't even come from</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;physics, but from Godel</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree, and Turing's work may be even better, he proved that no computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; program (and I think that's what we are) can predict what it will do next,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is, if it will ever stop. The easiest, indeed the only way to know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; a computer program will do is to run it and see, we figure out what we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to do when we actually do it. This would be true regardless of whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Universe is deterministic or not.</i><br>
<p>
This is misleading in the extreme.  Free will has everything to do with<br>
the absense of determinism, while predicitability only shows us where<br>
known determinism precludes the possibility of free will.  To take the <br>
inverse of this and define free will as the absence of predictability <br>
is to gratutitously redefine the meaning of the term "free will" itself<br>
since the inverse of a proposition can not, in general, be assumed to<br>
have the same truth value.<br>
<p>
The short definition of free will is: "The ability or discretion to <br>
choose; free choice" [The American Heritage dictionary 3rd edition].<br>
It defines a reality that is refuted by the presence of either <br>
necessity or predictability.  A secondary definition that talks <br>
about constraint has a somewhat obsolete definition that fails to<br>
take into account the modern human understanding that constraint<br>
may be internal as well as external, BUT that does not justify <br>
changing the primary definition into its inverse.<br>
<p>
This gratutituous redefinition of "free will" to mean Turing non-<br>
predictability in the AI, extropian, and scientific community is, in<br>
general, a strong testament to the pervasiveness of "group think" or<br>
"political correctness" within the human condition in general, and<br>
the blindness that such "group think" inspires.  The redefinition of<br>
words to new meanings is right up there with the Marxist rewriting<br>
of history.  It is not something that we are in any way free from<br>
simply because we are "scientific", or "extropian".<br>
