<p>
<p>
If I'm the boss and the state works for me then I should be able to fire the  <br>
state whenever I want to. Unfortunately I can not, because I am not the boss <br>
and the state won't let me quit.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I *do* agree that this is often not the case today. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
On of the great understatements of all time.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The problem is that government is too corrupt and influenced         &gt;(usually even set up) by economy. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, but that's not because we were just unlucky and elected the wrong <br>
politicians, it's inherent in the system. Suppose I want to make $10,000,  <br>
there are two ways to go about it. I can work to repeal hundreds of special <br>
interest laws, each one costing me a few dollars, or I can lobby for the <br>
passage of one more special interest law that will give me and my friends<br>
$10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two. The second method makes much <br>
more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than to repeal hundreds .<br>
<p>
This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive  <br>
at GM to be promoted to a  position of greater power there is only one thing <br>
I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the executive has <br>
been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank account but it will <br>
not help his chances for advancement, it will hurt it because his boss will  <br>
note that his decisions have been poor and do  not made economic sense. <br>
The stockholders will note the same thing.<br>
<p>
All this causes a lot of problems for government, the main trouble with <br>
theft is that it's  mostly a net loss, not just a transfer of funds. <br>
For the victim it is of  course a total loss, but what about the thief? <br>
A thief has a job and like all jobs it involves labor and expenses, in this <br>
case legal costs and loss of his livelihood when he's in jail. The net <br>
benefit in the interaction between thief and victim is only a small part of <br>
his income. He will likely expend 9$ worth of labor, labor he could have used <br>
to make money in other ways, in order to receive 10$ worth of stolen property.<br>
<p>
This situation in no way changes when government is the thief. Individuals <br>
pay an enormous cost to try to protect themselves from this thief, <br>
accountants,  tax lawyers, and most important of all, the organization of <br>
resources to  minimize taxes rather that to maximize the generation of real <br>
wealth. The results is that  the net loss is close to or equal to the amount <br>
stolen by government.                    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;For government does not have a general interest in acting  "evil",        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;but big biz has, in order to            </i><br>
<i>        &gt; - sell more                </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What on Earth is evil about selling something to somebody who wants to buy it?<br>
<p>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;- pay  fewer taxes </i><br>
<p>
What on Earth is evil about protecting you possessions from theft?<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;- get rid of competitors          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There are two ways a company could get rid of competitors.<br>
<p>
1) It could become more efficient than the competition. This would mean that    <br>
   the company would be producing a product that individuals chose because   <br>
   they liked it better than the alternative. In the name of human freedom    <br>
   this horrible state of affairs can not be allowed, the government sees to   <br>
   that.<br>
<p>
2) The proper way to deal with a competitor who makes a product that is <br>
   better and cheaper than yours is to use your "clout" to lobby the    <br>
   government to regulate your industry. I can't emphasize enough that <br>
   purpose of this regulation is only to increase individual freedom, and of    <br>
   course the best way to do that is to have government agents use force or    <br>
   the threat of force to stop anyone from making a product superior to mine.  <br>
   What better way is there to promote free competition?<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;- get state subventions </i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK, you got 1 out of 4 right, that IS evil.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;anarchies are  not workable </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Who runs the Internet? Does the internet work? Who decided on what the rules <br>
of English should be, and what government agency enforces it? Does English  <br>
work?<br>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;There is no free market or real  competition, just a search for the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;highes profit rates.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I fail to see the distinction. If you're making a ton of money then yours <br>
must be a great business to be in. I'm going to get in too, and I'm going to <br>
do my best to make an even higher  profit rate than you do.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;those who do the hardest physical work (workers in factories,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;farmers  etc.) usually get the fewest money in  capitalist systems </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Yes, brute strength is the very easiest thing to automate. If a surgeon was <br>
going to cut me open and then put me back together again, I would hope he  <br>
could demand more money for his services than somebody whose only skill was <br>
the ability to dig a ditch.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If companies invest, they do not invest in employees but in what          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;promises the highest profit. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
In other words they pay their employees what they're worth not what they want, <br>
just what you'd expect from an organization that is not a charity. If I can <br>
find somebody who can do your job better than you can and is willing to work <br>
for less, what is wrong with that? Look at it from the other side, suppose <br>
you found somebody who would pay you twice what you make now for fewer hours <br>
of work, would there be anything immoral in you quitting your present job?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Lots of people pay and few get the money. In the end, there's mass         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;poverty, hunger and a few very, very rich (but usually not very         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;clever) guys.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Let me see if I have this straight: The problem with the world is that there <br>
are too many greedy people and you want more money. Most are too materialist <br>
and you want more material things. The poor want a more affluent lifestyle,  <br>
the rich have figured out a way to obtain it, but the poor are more <br>
intelligent.  Is that about it? Have I missed anything?<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Capitalism is the true pyramid system. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If that's the way you feel about it then the solution is obvious, don't be a  <br>
capitalist. I really don't see what your problem is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I only see one motivation that drives all Libertarians. It's not        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the desire for  freedom or the desire for justice. It's pure greed.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Oh yeah, and in some cases it's  stupidity.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Oh, now I see. You think you're morally superior to us and are far more <br>
intelligent. You think we're too stupid to make decisions for ourselves and <br>
for our own good you must do it for us. You'll make us become socialists   <br>
whether we want to or not. Erik, can you see why such a policy might cause  <br>
some resentment in your subjects? <br>
<p>
As for your other insults, I am not ashamed of my opinions, if I didn't think <br>
freedom and justice were good things I would not lie about it, I would just <br>
say so. You will note that I have not said so. If what you say about "all"<br>
Libertarians is true then almost everybody on this list is an unjust freedom <br>
hating greedy moron who lies about their motivation. Why do you even talk to <br>
us?<br>
