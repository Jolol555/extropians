I fail to see how avoiding political debate or discussion is respectful<br>
to this listserv. Personally I would be interested in (1.) why you find<br>
libertarianism undesirable, and (2.) what political party or form of<br>
government you do percieve to be *more* suitable to transhumanism. <br>
<p>
I imagine I would find such information and debate thorougly<br>
informative. I have not read all of the posts for this thread, but of<br>
those I have read, I have not seen any mention of an alternative<br>
political party to libertarianism. It seems to me that if you are going<br>
to criticize something, you ought to offer an alternative. This is what<br>
we call *constructive* criticism. <br>
