<i>&gt;Why sadness?  You took a post with an intention to locate a printing press</i><br>
<i>&gt;and singled out a visual idea and made it into a scientific debate.  Then</i><br>
<i>&gt;you began attacking values and accusing intent without fully comprehending</i><br>
<i>&gt;the concept. Your blatant comments were based on an area of interest that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you consider yourself to be adept at, but you missed all else.  Rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;ask questions, your made assumptions and claimed them as facts.</i><br>
<p>
The point was that this is a poster that will be seen by many people, making<br>
the extropian concepts, and related concepts (nanotech especially) look like<br>
scifi. This doesn't help the scientific world's impression of these<br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, I can see. I don't believe that anyone was intentionally trying to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;science or you look foolish.</i><br>
<p>
No, not intentionally, but the to the general public this sort of art makes<br>
scientists interested in nanotech and futurism look like space cadets. Not<br>
an image builder.<br>
