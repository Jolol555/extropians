<i>&gt; &gt;Physicists and programmers can readily point to simple, repeatable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;experiments that conclusively demonstrate their principles.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Programmers?  Most people believe all sorts of crap that computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; salespeople tell them, even though repeatable experiments often</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate the opposite.  The vast majority of programmer claims out</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are of the form "We can write software to do X in Y months",</i><br>
<i>&gt; which are rarely repeatably experimented on.  </i><br>

Interesting.  Is that the kind of thing taught in "computer science"<br>
classes these days?  Nebulous ideas about methodology and scheduling?<br>
I honestly don't know; my 16 years of programming experience do not<br>
include any formal education.  Never had any use for it.  They hire me<br>
to write stuff.  It either works or it doesn't.  Very testable, clear,<br>
and scientific.<br>
<p>
But even if we remove that example from the argument, I still think it<br>
holds: politics is a less testable science, and therefore an easier<br>
subject for passionate advocates to flourish in with less risk of being<br>
disproved. <br>
<p>
After seeing the other replies, though, I think Eric's "high stakes"<br>
argument is more compelling (not that they compete).  Politicians are<br>
playing with real people's lives.  If one has reached some conclusion--<br>
right or wrong--about what political system is best, one is naturally<br>
driven to be evangelical and inflexible, because you will view its<br>
competing ideas as deadly.<br>
<p>
This is precisely why I like to take on popular ideas aggressively.<br>
I like to shake up the mental cobwebs a bit, attack ideas head-on.<br>
Eric and I had a related exchange on argumentation techniques just<br>
a few weeks ago; you might look that up in the archives (I changed<br>
the thread title to "The Game of Argument", but there was earlier<br>
stuff under a title I don't remember).<br>
