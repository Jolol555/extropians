God's existence or non existence is a matter of faith. There's no evidence<br>
that will make a very pious individual become an atheist. In any case,<br>
there's nothing about religion that is for or against nanotechnology.<br>
Judaism has always adapted to changes in society, and the Dalai Lama said<br>
the physics would not change for Buddhism, Buddhism would change for<br>
physics. You'll never conclusively prove God doesn't exist, simply because<br>
no one who believes will accept it. Similarily, it's nearly (but less)<br>
impossible to prove that God does exist. <br>
