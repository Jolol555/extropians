<i>&gt;&gt;...Many of the elements I quoted involve information which is quite easy to</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;So you admit that they are doing well with the info they have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;immediately available, but that they are non-Bayesian regarding the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;amount of research they do?  </i><br>
<p>
No.  Most people pick up opinions from family, friends, media, or natural<br>
human bias and then look for evidence to confirm it.  That's not a Bayesian<br>
process.  Bayesian inference requires unbiased data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Easy to research" is relative to your</i><br>
<i>&gt;education level, and its not at all clear to me that most people would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be well-advised to go do more research on questions like this.</i><br>
<p>
You must not have many friends with no savings (from not paying attention to<br>
the Social Security business) and underwater in their houses (from not paying<br>
attention to where the money goes or the variability of real estate prices).<br>
 I do.  You must not know people who blow large amounts of money on gambling<br>
tables.  I do.  Being wrong on the issues I mentioned is a serious detriment,<br>
except for perhaps the age of the earth.<br>
<p>
We may be disagreeing on how easy it is to research.  It is relative to<br>
educational level, but anybody with a junior high education should be able to<br>
read and use a library catalogue and that's all I think these require.<br>
