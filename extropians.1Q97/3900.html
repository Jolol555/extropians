As I recall (dimly), monozygotic twins occur in about every 80 births. Or<br>
maybe that's both sorts of twins.  In any event, surely the natural<br>
experiment has happened many times by now, even if geniuses are one in a<br>
million.  We know that identical twins reared in proximity tend, for<br>
psychic self-protection, to differentiate themselves in behaviour, dress,<br>
professional interests, etc, to a greater extent than those who are<br>
separated, but if genius is largely genomic-cum-uterine you'd expect it to<br>
show up in whatever field the twins entered.  <br>
<p>
The only case that comes to my mind is Prof. Gregory Benford, who is<br>
certainly an extraordinarily talented man in both physics and literature.<br>
His identical twin (Jim?) may be a fine fellow, but I've never read any of<br>
his novels or heard of his scientific contributions.  Any other names come<br>
to mind?<br>
