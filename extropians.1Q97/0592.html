<i>&gt;&gt;Irwin Silverman and Marion Eals, in a paper in _The Adapted Mind_ (ed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby), assumed that the differences in cognitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;abilities between the sexes were a result of specializations for hunting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in men and foraging in women.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And there are plenty of citations to nullify that hypothesis as well. </i><br>
<i>&gt;_The Descent of Woman_ lays out several theories, and one could point </i><br>
<i>&gt;to Estioko-Griffin's 'Daughters of the Forest', an anthropological study </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the warrior/hunter women of the Agta tribe of the Sierra Madra.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Not to mention the seeming lack of gender role division in New </i><br>
<i>&gt;Zealand tribes and the pioneer societies of Early America.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Everyone should read about the Aquatic Ape hypothesis, as championed by<br>
Elaine Morgan in her books  The Descent of Woman and Scars of Evolution.<br>
 I'd always thought that it had much more plausibility than the usual<br>
 savannah tales, which do tend to be sexist in a rather dumb kind of way,<br>
and was encouraged to note that no less a mind that Daniel C. Dennett<br>
thinks it's pretty reasonable too. Apparently the blanket scoffing is<br>
dying down, and there are signs of of it getting more serious attention<br>
<i>&gt;from researchers. Obviously, if it's correct, it will necessitate a major</i><br>
overhaul of all our ideas about our origins, so it's no surprise that<br>
people have been cautious about it..<br>
