Lee Daniel Crocker wrote 3/17/97: &lt;This is insufferable misinterpretation<br>
of Popper, and with no excuse given other than Stove's own emotional<br>
discomfort with carefully reasoned ideas....  Mr. Stove seems uncomfortable<br>
with the obvious fact that expanding knowledge implies expanding<br>
ignorance....  Mr. Stove's discomfort with "conjectural knowledge" is<br>
merely cowardice: he doesn't want to admit that every act taken by every<br>
human being is a gamble on<br>
the efficacy of what we call knowledge.  He seems dismayed by that rather<br>
than enlivened and freed.  That's /his/ failure, not Popper's.&gt;<br>
<p>
Oh my.  Armchair pschoanalytical attributions of emotional defects to other<br>
individuals' reasoning processes does not make those reasoning processes<br>
irrational.  The armchair stance itself is irrational; it is not reasoning,<br>
it is political invective.  Popper's "carefully reasoned ideas," as you put<br>
it, were in fact, sloppily executed attempts to unsuccessfully deduce his<br>
way out of a wet paper bag.  See the fatal critique below.<br>
<p>
Guru George wrote 3/17/97: &lt;Sorry to disagree with you Reilly, but I have<br>
to say that Stove's critique of Popper is complete bollocks - much as I<br>
enjoy Stove's acidic style.  The point of 'falsifiability' is this: if you<br>
are serious about using experience to test theory then the only way you can<br>
*logically* do so is deductively: you deduce empirical consequences from a<br>
theory, and if those experiences don't pan out, then the theory logically<br>
*must* be false.&gt;<br>
<p>
So you give Stove an A for style, and an F for content.  Does that average<br>
out to a C?  ;)  See the fatal critique below.<br>
<p>
Guru: &lt;But there is no such thing as a *logic* of induction: there is no<br>
logical *necessity* to induction, no logical 'must', like you get in<br>
deduction: this is what Hume showed.&gt;<br>
<p>
Stove reportedly held Hume in the highest regard, but this did not prevent<br>
him from correcting Hume's 'perfectionistic' errors.  I have a strong<br>
hunch, but I am not certain &lt;g&gt;, that your concerns are addressed by Stove<br>
in his technical works "Rationality of Induction" (1986), and "Probability<br>
and Hume's Inductive Skepticism" (1973).<br>
<p>
Stove's point about the efficacy of the cumulative results of induction,<br>
can be seen in a common-sensical way if you picture yourself as a scientist<br>
seeking grant money from the government or private sources to do scientific<br>
experiments.  It is commonplace to obtain funding for an experiment seeking<br>
to verify predictions of a highly regarded (meaning politically sanctioned)<br>
theory, or to perform duplicate experiments to immediately verify previous<br>
highly regarded experimental results.  But it is hard to obtain funding for<br>
doing experiments on 'crackpot' theories (where did the authority to label<br>
them 'crackpot' come from?), and it becomes exceedingly difficult to fund<br>
the duplication of well-established experimental results more than a few<br>
times.<br>
<p>
Now, Guru George says that "Popper's idea is that we ought to test our<br>
ideas to destruction."  But this is clearly irrational on the face of it. <br>
No scientist, and no funding agency, is going to indefinitely work on<br>
duplicating the same experiment over and over and over, "to destruction." <br>
Scientists working in the real world don't want to waste their lives<br>
increasing the cumulative inductive probabilities from a very high<br>
percentage to an infinitesimally higher percentage; nor do agencies with<br>
money to spend on science.  This is the real rational world, not Popper's<br>
irrational critical-unto-destruction world.<br>
<p>
All right, out of the purest, most unselfish, highest altruistic extropian<br>
motives, I will, as a public service to all interested newbies on the list,<br>
repost the fatal criticism of Popper's falsifiability principle.<br>
<p>
--------------------------<br>

<i>&gt;From "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" 3/8/95:</i><br>
<p>
Quotes from Elliott Sober's "Philosophy of Biology"  (1993):<br>
<p>
  "Popper's criterion of falsifiability requires that we be able to single<br>
out a special class of sentences and call them observation sentences.  A<br>
proposition is then said to be falsifiable precisely when it is related to<br>
observation sentences in a special way:  Proposition P is falsifiable if<br>
and only if P deductively implies at least one observation sentence O.  One<br>
problem with Popper's proposal is that it requires that the distinction<br>
between observation statements and other statements be made precise.  To<br>
check the statement 'The chicken is dead,' you must know what a chicken is<br>
and what death is.  *This problem is sometimes expressed by saying that<br>
observation is theory laden.*   Every claim that people make about what<br>
they observe depends for its justification on their possessing prior<br>
information.  Popper addresses this problem by saying that what one regards<br>
as an observation statement is a matter of convention.  But this solution<br>
will hardly help one tell, in a problematic case, whether a statement is<br>
falsifiable.  For Popper's criterion to have some bite, there must be a<br>
nonarbitrary way to distinguish observation sentences from the rest.  To<br>
date, no one has managed to do this in a satisfactory manner.<br>
<p>
  The problems with Popper's falsifiability criterion go deeper.  First,<br>
there is the so-called tacking problem.  Suppose that some proposition S is<br>
falsifiable.  It immediately follows that the conjunction of S and any<br>
other proposition N is falsifiable as well.  That is, if S makes<br>
predictions that can be checked observationally, so does the conjunction S<br>
&amp; N.  This is an embarrassment to Popper's proposal since he wanted that<br>
proposal to separate nonscientific propositions N from properly scientific<br>
propositions S.  Presumably, if N is not scientifically respectable,<br>
neither is S &amp; N.  The falsifiability criterion does not obey this<br>
plausible requirement.<br>
<p>
  Another problem with Popper's proposal is that it has peculiar<br>
implications about the relation of a proposition to its negation.  Consider<br>
a statement of the form 'All As are B.'  Popper judges this statement<br>
falsifiable since it would be falsified by observing a single A that fails<br>
to be B.  But now consider the negation of the generalization-the statement<br>
that say 'There exists an object that is both A and not-B.'  This statement<br>
is not  falsifiable; no single observed object or finite collection of them<br>
can falsify this existence claim.  So the generalization is falsifiable,<br>
though its negation is not.  But this is very odd-presumably, if a<br>
statement is 'scientific,' so is its negation.  *This suggests that<br>
falsifiability is not a good criterion for being scientific.*<br>
<p>
  Still another problem with Popper's proposal is that most theoretical<br>
statements in science do not, all by themselves, make predictions about<br>
what can be checked observationally.  Theories make testable predictions<br>
only when they are conjoined with auxiliary assumptions.  Typically, T does<br>
not deductively imply O; rather, it is T &amp; A that deductively implies O<br>
(here, T is a theory, O is an observation statement, and A is a set of<br>
auxiliary assumptions).  This idea is sometimes called Duhem's Thesis...<br>
<p>
  The final problem with Popper's proposal is that it entails that<br>
probability statements in science are unfalsifiable.  Consider the<br>
statement that a coin is fair-that its probability of landing heads when<br>
tossed is 0.5.  ...It is possible for a fair coin to land heads on all ten<br>
tosses, to land heads on nine and tails on one, and so on.  Probability<br>
statements are not falsifiable in Popper's sense.  In fact, something like<br>
the Likelihood Principle is what Popper himself adopted when he recognized<br>
that probability statements are not falsifiable.<br>
<p>
  Popper held that there is an asymmetry between falsification and<br>
verification.  A vestige of Popper's asymmetry can be restored if we<br>
include the premiss that the auxiliary assumptions (A) are true:<br>
<p>
Falsification          Verification<br>
If T &amp; A, then O       If T &amp; A, then O<br>
A                      A<br>
not-O                  O<br>
--------               --------<br>
not-T                  T<br>
deductively valid      deductively invalid<br>
<p>
  Although we now seem to have a difference between verification and<br>
falsification, it is important to notice that the argument falsifying T<br>
requires that we be able to assert that the auxiliary assumptions A are<br>
true.  Auxiliary assumptions are often highly theoretical; if we can't<br>
verify A, we will not be able to falsify T by using the deductively valid<br>
argument form just described.  In the last pair of displayed arguments, one<br>
is deductively valid and the other is not.  However, this does nothing to<br>
support Popper's asymmetry thesis.  In fact, we should draw precisely the<br>
opposite conclusion:  The left-hand argument suggests that if we cannot<br>
verify theoretical statements, then we cannot falsify them either.<br>
<p>
  One problem with Popper's asymmetry thesis is that it equates what can be<br>
known with what can be deduced validly from observation statements. <br>
However, science often makes use of nondeductive argumentation, in which<br>
the conclusion is said to be rendered plausible or to be well supported by<br>
the premisses.  In such arguments, the premisses do not absolutely<br>
guarantee that the conclusion must be true.<br>
<p>
  On the face of it, vulnerability appears to be a defect, not a virtue. <br>
Why is it desirable that the hypotheses we believe should be refutable? <br>
Wouldn't science be more secure if it were invulnerable to empirical<br>
disconfirmation?  The Likelihood Principle helps answer these questions.  A<br>
consequence of this principle is that if O favors H1 over H2, then not-O<br>
would favor H2 over H1.  This is because if P(O/H1) &gt; P(O/H2), then<br>
P(not-O/H1) &lt; P(not-O/H1).  We want our beliefs to be supported by<br>
observational evidence.  For this to be possible, they must be vulnerable;<br>
there must be possible observations that would count against them.  This<br>
requirement is not a vestige of the discredited falsifiability criterion. <br>
It flows from the Likelihood Principle itself."<br>
<p>
--------------------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "PHIL: Questioning Popperianism" 3/10/95:</i><br>
<p>
My commentary on Sober's quotes:  I agree with Sober that falsifiability is<br>
not a criterion for a scientific proposition, his points are valid.<br>
<p>
His points about there being no "nonarbitrary way to distinguish<br>
observation sentences from the rest" and "observation is theory laden" deal<br>
with semantic and logical limitations inherent in our biological nature.  I<br>
think that deductive logic and mathematics are wonderful tools for<br>
producing truth.  The truth they produce, however, is bounded within the<br>
axiomatic system chosen.  Popper's desire to produce truth by limiting it<br>
to deductive logical observation statements that can be falsified is a<br>
narrow view typical of any evolving system of science approaching nullity<br>
(the only end result of criticism or skepticism).  The tacking problem, the<br>
negation problem, the auxiliary statements problem are all related to this<br>
narrowness of view that plagues deduction.<br>
<p>
The point about probability statements not being falsifiable addresses<br>
induction problems, such as Hume's critique about the deductive disconnect<br>
between cause and effect.  Any time probabilty is used anywhere, for<br>
anything, it is an announcement of ignorance of what will happen next,<br>
meaning an ignorance of causes.  Probability statements are maps of<br>
objective truth, generalizations open to interpretations from whatever<br>
theory you subscribe to at the moment that satisfies your needs.<br>
<p>
To me, verifiability is every bit as important as falsifiability is.  I<br>
agree that where possible, we want our beliefs to be supported by<br>
vulnerable observational evidence.  Experimental evidence, though, begins<br>
with theory which is wide-open, and ends with relative boundaries being<br>
drawn around events and objects that constitute what the experiment is, and<br>
what the evidence is.  The only real event and object that can be described<br>
in an absolute sense, is the whole universe.  Since we can't do this, we<br>
fall back on utility, we describe each event and object as best fits our<br>
needs of the moment while aiming at truth.  In science, we try to get as<br>
much consensual agreement on these relative boundaries as possible, so that<br>
our experiments can be repeated.  Obviously, no experiment or event is ever<br>
exactly duplicated.  All events are historical, unique and irreversible,<br>
but many scientifically agreed on events are similar enough to suit our<br>
needs of the moment.  Verifiability occurs when we bring scientific<br>
knowledge to bear on our life through technology.  Science is verified<br>
through practical usefulness in hard material reality.<br>
