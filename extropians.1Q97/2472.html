LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS<br>
<p>
There has been a lot of discussion going on over in the "Church of<br>
Virus" mailing list about the "Level 2" and "Level 3" of consciousness<br>
that I describe in Virus of the Mind. The discussion has taken on a<br>
comedy-drama of its own, with various participants claiming they are<br>
not, in fact, real people, but rather characters being played by each<br>
other. But questions keep coming up about what is meant by Level 3.<br>
<p>
To backpedal a bit, Level 1 of consciousness is instinctual and<br>
animalistic. Level-1 operators do not live by conscious philosophy.<br>
Abstractions such as economics and physics are foreign to them. They<br>
live with the hand they were dealt, not making much use of learned<br>
philosophy.<br>
<p>
Level 2, where most educated people operate, makes use of conceptual<br>
tools to map out life and plan results for the future. Religions, the<br>
scientific method, and all academic learning are examples of Level-2<br>
structures. In Level 2, one's picture of the world gets clearer and<br>
clearer. Often people will not break through to Level 3 unless and until<br>
they have a life experience that invalidates and shatters their world<br>
view.<br>
<p>
Level 3 is characterized by the ability to flex your meme-space on the<br>
fly; to use multiple models depending upon your purpose and priorities.<br>
It's possible to gain an intellectual understanding of what this means<br>
from Level 2, but probably not possible to really feel the impact of the<br>
difference in life experience. The Level-3 mind has a great capacity to<br>
hold dissonant, contradictory beliefs. (Einstein was said to have this<br>
ability.) <br>
<p>
Those interested in joining in the discussion in the Church of Virus<br>
mailing list can find subscription information at Meme Central. The web<br>

REJOICE<br>
<p>
Have you heard the new radio spot for "Rejoice" adult incontinence<br>
garments? I heard it yesterday as I was driving up highway 167 in Kent.<br>
Yes, finally there's an adult incontinence undergarment you can ... er<br>
... DEPEND on? ... er ... ASSURE? ... er ... well, you can REJOICE! Is<br>
anyone else getting annoyed that more and more everyday words are being<br>
drafted into involuntary servitude as labels for old-age-infirmity<br>
products?<br>
<p>
By the way, their phone number is 1-800-KEEP-DRY. As Dave Barry would<br>
say, I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP!<br>
