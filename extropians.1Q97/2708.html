Haveing now spent several years in pursuit of a Ph.D. in political<br>
economy, the following observation stands out to me as the most<br>
puzzling:   Why do people seem so damn confident of their political<br>
opinions?   <br>
<p>
On topics such as physics or computers, most people are willing, even<br>
anxious to admit that they don't know very much, and they are willing<br>
to defer to a surprizing degree to people who specialize in such topics.<br>
<p>
On political topics, however, most people hold surprizingly many<br>
opinions, seem remarkably confident in those opinions, and seem<br>
unwilling to defer to people who spend their lives studing such<br>
topics.  They are even most unwilling to grant that people with<br>
contrary opinions may know something that they don't.  This holds most<br>
directly for political science, but also for related areas of<br>
economics and sociology.<br>
<p>
I see this behavior on this list as well.   Why?  Why so few<br>
qualifiers and "I don't know"s on political topics?  <br>
<p>
Yes, of course part of what brings us together is an interest in<br>
anarcho-capitalist type political institutions.  But why are so many<br>
of you so damn confident that you know how such things would actually<br>
function, or which minute variation would actually be best?  <br>
<p>
Social systems are perhaps the most complex systems we know, and for<br>
which our ignornance should be the most vivid.  Why is this so hard to<br>
admit? <br>
