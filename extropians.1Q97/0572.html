I don't thing you're a lunatic Eliezer, religious or otherwise, I just think  <br>
you're wrong.        <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;Being a religious lunatic does not automatically imply that                 </i><br>

                     <br>
<p>
As I said before, I don't think we have a soul but I don't find the idea  <br>
crazy, what is crazy is that information processing doesn't cause <br>
consciousness and the soul doesn't either.       <br>
                   <br>

<i>                &gt;of the neurons.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Well we know the brain can do just that, it generates a very weak <br>
electromagnetic field, and if it is not absorbed by the Earth's ionosphere it <br>
will survive until The Big Crunch, but I don't think that's what you mente. <br>
You're talking about some mysterious immortal energy field that is responsible <br>
for consciousness, fine, but in that case the energy field is identical with <br>
the traditional concept of the soul.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;It is possible that consciousness is noncomputable, but that                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;it still goes out like a light with the removal of the brain,                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and is nothing more than the interaction of the noncomputable          </i><br>
<i>                &gt;physical particles making up the brain.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Even if I give you the very large and completely unsubstantiated point that  <br>
atoms are black boxes of noncomputable stuff, it wouldn't change my theory <br>
that information is the essence of what we are. One point I do refuse to give <br>
you, because it would mean that almost all Physics done in the last 90 years <br>
is garbage, is that noncomputable or not, one Hydrogen atom is identical to <br>
another Hydrogen atom. <br>
<p>
If I find the information on the position and velocity of every atom, every  <br>
noncomputable black box, in your brain by using a destructive scan, and if I  <br>
then use that information to put new atoms in the same positions, then that  <br>
new brain is you. Unless of course you have a soul.<br>

<i>                &gt;There are known mathematical concepts, such as "oracle                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;machines", which violate the Church-Turing thesis in a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;technical sense by being able to solve the halting problem                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;for lesser oracular ordinals, such as Turing machines.              </i><br>
<i>                &gt;These mathematical concepts have no religious implications.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Near as I can tell these concepts have no implications of any sort. Not long <br>
ago two French scientists, Bournez and Cosnard, published a paper about a  <br>
super Turing Machine, an analog automation that could do things no Turing  <br>
Machine could. The trouble is, Analog Computers do not exist, never have  <br>
never will. I can think of 4 reasons: <br>
<p>
1) Matter, energy, momentum, spin, and electrical charge are all <br>
   unquestionably digital, they come is discrete package. It could well turn    <br>
   out that space and time do too. When you build your analog computer you          <br>
   must make use of all these things.<br>
<p>
2) An analog computer MUST have an infinite number of internal states, so it       <br>
   must be built with infinite precision, but quantum mechanics tells us that    <br>
   is impossible.<br>
<p>
3) If your analog computer is operating at any temperature above absolute <br>
   zero (and it will be) it will be subjected to thermal vibrations further    <br>
   reducing it's precision.<br>
<p>
4) Unlike digital machines, any errors in a analog machine are cumulative.          <br>
   This is very serious in all but the simplest calculations.<br>
<p>
The best we can do is build pseudo analog devices with limited precision and    <br>
a FINITE number of internal states, that is a pale reflection of the analog    <br>
concept. A digital computer can simulate a pseudo analog computer perfectly,   <br>
but the reverse is not true. I admit that there are some Real numbers that a<br>
Digital Computer can not deal with, Turing proved that, but it can handle a <br>
lot more than a pseudo analog computer can. A digital computer can be made to  <br>
work with arbitrary precision, but the precision of an pseudo analog computer  <br>
is strictly limited by the laws of physics. At times it may be more convenient  <br>
to use a pseudo analog device than a conventional digital computer, but that  <br>
is an engineering consideration not a philosophical principal.                     <br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Quantum randomness, if truly random, is not computable in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the strict sense.  This has no religious implications and                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;does not even  *impinge* on AI </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
I agree, it has nothing to do with intelligence or Free Will or religion.  <br>
So what's your point?                <br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;As for your explanation, I saved it and have it flagged in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;my list of favorite messages. It's  very interesting. The                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;only problem is that it applied as well to ones and zeroes                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;as any hypothesized soul</i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Not so. Axioms should always be as simple and as self evidently true as  <br>
possible. Both a bit and the soul are equally simple objects, neither is made <br>
of internal parts, however there is a difference. What the bit does is just  <br>
as simple as what a bit is, what the soul does on the other hand is VERY far <br>
from self evident, this equally simple object, does things that are <br>
astoundingly complex. I can not imagine anything more complex. If this is  <br>
really true then it's magic and I'm going to church.<br>
