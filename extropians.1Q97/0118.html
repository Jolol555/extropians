Back on Sat, 12 Oct 1996 15:32:39 -0400 &lt;Enigl@aol.com&gt;<br>
wrote an essay titled "Collectivist anarchy vs. Individualist anarchy".<br>
In it he described his idea of a collectivist or socialistic<br>
anarchy vs. a individualistic and misnamedly capitalistic<br>
anarchy.  I think he had his definitions mixed up, however, and<br>
I'll attempt to set the record straight.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anarcho-syndicalism looks to me like "Anarcho-communism, communism without</i><br>
<i>&gt; the state" or because communism is though of a state, more accurately:</i><br>
<i>&gt; spontaneous socialism/ collectivist anarchy. AKA Libertarian-socialism.</i><br>
<p>
This is more or less true, however, what is left out is that <br>
anarcho-syndicalism, or libertarian socialism, is not a philosophy based<br>
on altruism but in fact on rational, enlightened self-interest.<br>
There are in fact win-win, and lose-win situations in a socialistic<br>
context as well as the context one might have between two capitalist<br>
businessmen who make a deal (both see themselves as "winning"...<br>
this is considered the capitalistic "win-win" situation...<br>
of course it is a win-lose situation when one capitalist is forcing<br>
people at gun point in a slave-labor shop in South Korea, or<br>
El Salvador.  In the case of a socialistic win-win situation,<br>
you have cases where two people agree to work on building a house.<br>
both will eventually benefit from the warmth of the house... but<br>
their agreement is not based on the exchange of capital, but<br>
the fact that they both need each others labor.  One could try to<br>
sucker the other individual <br>
<p>
So-called Libertarian capitalism or "Anarcho-capitalism" is described as<br>
capitalism without the state. This, however, is far from comparable to<br>
libertarian socialism or even anarchist individualism.  A capitalism<br>
without the state would not do away with state regulations<br>
of private property, because the new private state put up to protect <br>
private property would prevent people from utilizing vast areas of<br>
property <br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Collectivist anarchy and Individualist anarchy vs "anarcho-" capitalism:<br>
<p>
There are two groups of Libertarians the Spontaneous<br>
Socialists (Collectivist anarchy) and the Individualist Anarchists.<br>
There is another group, the so-called anarcho-capitalists, but<br>
they in fact are one of the current incarnations of a form<br>
of liberalism that existed before the more common Liberalism<br>
of the post-FDR years.  This type of "liberalism" bases it's<br>
"liberal" emphasis on the fact that it opposes the State and<br>
the Church as entities that control capital.   It does not,<br>
however, have much to say about liberty of labor, or the rights<br>
of individuals in the labor force, beyond that they have the "choice"<br>
of whom to take order from, or the opportunity to become a boss<br>
and give orders to someone else.<br>
<p>
The first group is where Rudolf Rocker, Noam Chomsky<br>
and Gregory P. Maximoff stand. A common misconception is that their<br>
systems are based on the illegalization of private property.  This<br>
is not true.  anarcho-syndicalism, or libertarian socialism, is based<br>
on working class individualists putting their own self-interests<br>
first and _abandoning_ the system of private property that<br>
exploits them.  The survival of such a group is not based on<br>
"expelling" win-lose meme private property people, but rather<br>
in keeping the win-win libertarian socialist people.<br>
<p>
This group does not force itself to not see the "win-win" aspects<br>
of capitalism: it's pretty obvious that there are some win-win<br>
transactions, where two powerful capitalists might make a transaction<br>
and each side be satisfied... however, what they recognize is<br>
that there is ALWAYS a win-lose side to capitalism in how workers<br>
are treated.<br>
<p>
Individualist and Socialistic anarchy are not fundamentally different.<br>
Some capitalist theorists have argued that capitalism is an<br>
individualist philosophy based on the idea that the "individual"<br>
capitalist is pitted against the "mass" of workers.  But the<br>
reality is that it is the individual worker against the<br>
individual boss.   The model of "mass" representing the left,<br>
something boosted by Stalinist ideology, only helped re-enforce<br>
the illusion of "individual" on the capitalist side.  However,<br>
the early individualist anarchists were not in favor of capitalism<br>
per se, they were simply opposed to mass state organizations like the<br>
Communist Party.  Individualist-leaning philosophers like Thomas Jefferson,<br>
Adam Smith, Lysander Spooner, Henry David Thoreau, Max Stirner and so on<br>
all believed that workers had fundamental rights, and the right to their<br>
fair share of labor... but they had to claim it themselves, through<br>
their own efforts, and through acts of resistance, strikes,<br>
and civil disobedience.. not by imposing ones will on the<br>
capitalist individual, but by refusing to be exploited by the<br>
capitalist individual.<br>
<p>
Another name for libertarian socialists might be "Laissez-Faire <br>
Socialists": the saying goes that if a group of libertarian<br>
workers were approached by a government official who asked them<br>
"what can I do for you?", the answer would be "leave us alone:<br>
labor united can solve it's own problems".  The Communist and<br>
Socialist parties turned to electorialism and the<br>
state as a tool to solve the working class's problems... but<br>
libertarian and individualist anarchists historically<br>
rejected this.<br>
<p>
Laissez-Faire Socialists (individualist and syndicalist anarchy)<br>
believe people like to work hard and get paid fairly for it. Win-win...<br>
(though capitalists often force themselves to refuse to see the win-win<br>
aspect of such a situation and only see it as win-lose, thus opposing<br>
working-class individuals who ask for nothing more than freedom<br>
from exploitation)<br>
<p>
Libertarian Socialism/ anarcho-syndicalism encourages people to work and<br>
be paid a fair wage (WIN-WIN) when they are employed.<br>
<p>
Libertarian socialism assumes people own their own bodies, unlike<br>
"anarcho-capitalism" where the individual is "owned" by the corporation<br>
they work for. In "anarcho-" capitalist society human behavior is regulated<br>
by the imposition of regulatory patents, copyright laws, and so on.<br>
<p>
BTW, Fascism is a form extreme capitalism. Fascism occours when small business <br>
owners, frightened of a rising, militant and organised working class,<br>
turn to the extreme right which uses workerist rhetoric and emotional<br>
appeals to build a counter-revolutionary movement to stop the spread<br>
of (libertarian) socialist ideas.<br>
