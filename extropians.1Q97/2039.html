<i>        &gt;It [Omega's definition of free will] is not in anyway circular,</i><br>

<i>        &gt;definition of "free" means (and only means) "acausal".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
To tell you the truth, the first time you used the word "acausal" I felt<br>
really dumb, I thought I should know the meaning of the word. When I couldn't<br>
find it in any dictionary I own I felt a little better. From your usage I<br>
gather you want it to mean something that happens without a cause, if so<br>
then it's a synonym for "random". If that's what you mean then I will grant<br>
you that your definition is no longer circular and is no longer vague, but<br>
it's boring, I wouldn't give a hoot in hell if I had free will or not.<br>
My definition is not boring, because regardless of whether you call it free<br>
will or something else, the inability to predict what we will do next is at<br>
the very hart of our emotional life, no doubt about that.<br>
<p>
If you want "acausal" it to mean something other than random then I need a<br>
little help to figure out what you're talking about. <br>
                              <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;John:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;How do you distinguish between " additional constraints" and</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;"external circumstances"? It all seems like exactly the same thing</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;to me, even divine will is just part of the external circumstances,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;just part of the problem to be solved.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Omega:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;No vagueness was intended, because by "additional constraints",</i><br>
<i>        &gt;I meant ALL constraints that one can semantically define</i><br>
<p>
<p>
In other words, all external circumstances. For the life of me I can't see<br>
why ALL "additional constraints" are not the same thing as ALL " external<br>
circumstances".<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;as would be consistent with the meaning of acausal.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can't think of any additional constraints or external circumstances or<br>
for that matter anything else under heaven or earth that would be<br>
INCONSISTENT with the meaning of acausal, because an acausal event doesn't<br>
need a cause, it doesn't need anything for it to happen, so there is no way<br>
it could be inconsistent with it (assuming my guess was right as to the<br>
meaning of acausal).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A further clarification here.  By "acausal", I mean "acausal" in</i><br>
<i>        &gt;principle, not just "functionally acausal" because of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Turing-unpredictability.  </i><br>
             <br>
I understand, you want to emphasize that the actions that result from free<br>
will have nothing to do with the information received from the senses,<br>
the nature of the environment, chemicals in the brain, the structure of the<br>
brain, the laws of Physics, or anything else. Free action are not caused by<br>
anything.<br>
<p>
<p>
If that's free then I want to be a slave, randomness sucks.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If your definition of unpredictability includes acausality, </i><br>
                              <br>
It does. Modern Physics makes a strong case that true randomness is possible.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;then our definitions are those of two partially overlapping sets.  </i><br>
                              <br>
If you said something had free will then I certainly would too, but there<br>
are some things I would say had free will but you would say they do not. <br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I agree that the self-referencing will ultimately be important, but </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I am not using it at this time because I feel that no ontological </i><br>
<i>        &gt;basis has yet been defined for the concept of self-referencing.</i><br>
                              <br>
But you just did use self reference, you said "I" 3 times in the brief <br>
sentence above, even " the concept of self-referencing" is self-referencing.<br>
In spit of this, or rather because of it, I had no trouble extracting<br>
meaning from your words. If "I" has no ontological basis then we might as<br>
well give up on "free will".<br>
<p>
I have no problem with self-reference  and I think its meaning is clear, or<br>
at least as clear as any human concept is. Godel used self-reference in his <br>
proof, in fact it was his proof. He proved that for any system in formal<br>
logic you can construct a grammatically correct sentence that in effect says<br>
"I can not be proven in this logic system". A string of cold hard logical<br>
statements, each as well defined as anything in human knowledge, can Jump out<br>
of their skin turn around and look back at themselves, and that's what makes<br>
Godel's work seem so magical. <br>
<p>
OK, I got a little carried away, I'm guilty of poetic excess (Eliezer forgive<br>
me), but I still think it's basically true.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;requires us to penetrate into an area of the ontologically unknown</i><br>
<i>        &gt;that we currently perceive as acausal behind which we may find both</i><br>
<i>        &gt;a truer form of acausality</i><br>
<p>
I don't think it's a good idea to invoke new science it we don't need to,<br>
and I don't think we need to. If free will is the inability of a person<br>
to predict his actions, then that explains the subjective feeling we have of<br>
freedom and is not inconsistent with any objective behavior I know of, so<br>
what's the problem?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It is an analyis that I doubt will work if we broaden the meaning of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the free-will to include the Turing style unpredictability,</i><br>
                       <br>
It sure beats random style unpredictability.<br>
                       <br>
<i>        &gt;we would then be confusing mathematical semanitics with physical</i><br>
<i>        &gt;causal principles; a problem that would be analogous to dragging the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;subject of orbital chaos into a discussion of the principles of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;gravitation.</i><br>
                              <br>
What would be wrong with that? It sure doesn't take very long for orbital<br>
chaos to show up, it only takes 3 bodies.        <br>
