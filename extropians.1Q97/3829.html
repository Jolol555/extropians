<i>&gt; &gt; copyrights and patents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It would be great if you could offer a model or some evidence/background</i><br>
<i>&gt; to back up these  facts.</i><br>
<p>
While he may be literally correct, the fact is that until our country<br>
developed its USPTO, investment in technological advancement was an<br>
extremely high risk proposition. This is why the only technologies that<br>
remained secure were those that were classified SECRET by governments,<br>
and enforced with death sentences. Unfortunately, this method tended to<br>
stifle cross fertilization as well as the possibility of mass producing<br>
secret inventions, since by their secrecy their market was limited.<br>
Those that did not remain secure were easily stolen and copied.<br>
Inventors never got rich on their own, they always had some rich<br>
politician or industrialist as their lord protector who made the most<br>
money off of it since they had the goons to enforce their self declared<br>
rights.<br>
<p>
With our current system, inventors have at least a better than even<br>
chance of getting paid fairly for their creations, even of enforcing<br>
their rights overseas. LDC seems to have gotten to his opinons by being<br>
disgusted with the high cost of comercially available software, but if<br>
intellectual property rights were fully enforced, software could be sold<br>
for the price of a paperback. The reason this isn't so is that its much<br>
easier to copy electronic data than printed bound material, so its much<br>
harder to enforce copyrights with software than books.<br>
<p>
The more widespread intellectual property enforcement occurs, the lower<br>
per unit intellectual property costs will be for consumers, so that<br>
prices will more closely reflect a "fair" market value. Intellectual<br>
property that is not properly protected or is only partially protected,<br>
like our present system causes a greater level of technological<br>
monopolization than with full enforcement systems. With zero enforcement<br>
systems, like the medieval secrecy system, people were not even given<br>
the opportunity to have access to technology, which seems to me to be a<br>
much greater level of monopolization than mere overpricing in a partial<br>
system like the present one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The fact that you confuse trademarks and licensing with copyrights and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; patents is a symptom of the problem.  Look at the objective realities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not the propaganda: If I use your name, I commit fraud.  That's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trademark.  If I break a contract with you, that's an enforceable tort.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not.  If you breach a contract you have Contract remedies available to</i><br>
<i>&gt; you, not those from tort law.  Fraud is enforceable in Tort.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you. Picking nits is not what I am after here, though. This all<br>
derives from my contention that recognition of intellectual property as<br>
a basic human right that is tied up in ones right to self expression, to<br>
choose to reproduce, to create new life, to seek the fulfillment of<br>
one's happiness. Man is the monkey that creates, or to use a theist<br>
term, our God given rights were given to reflect the power of God within<br>
each and every one of us to create.<br>
<p>
Of course, in a perfect world, where a corporation only has the power of<br>
the average individual, LDC's concepts would be great, but in my mind<br>
reflect the sort of egalatarian socialist utopia that Marxists dreamt of<br>
rather than any libertarian hope.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If I reprint a chapter from a book you wrote--and which you freely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chose to publish on the open market with no disclaimers or licenses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or physical protection of any sort--and not claiming that it's mine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have not committed fraud, I have breached no contract that I signed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have merely used information that I got through non-coercive means</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for my own benefit, and the government will come in--at my expense</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as well as yours--and prosecute me for it.  That's a copyright (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; similarly for patents).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good point, but you still havn't expressed how IP would be protected</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise.</i><br>
<p>
Listen, contracts between individuals don't mean squat. The ski industry<br>
has tried for years to protect themselves from ridiculous law suits from<br>
people that are injured at ski areas due to personal negligence, through<br>
no fault of the resorts. Every ski ticket has on it a waiver stating<br>
that to purchase a ticket is to recognise the individuals complete<br>
responsibility for oneself, etc. etc., and signs in front of the ticket<br>
offices say this, and the ticket sales people say to read the ticket,<br>
and all credit card reciepts that are signed also have this agreement on<br>
them. You'd think that they'd be fully protected, right? No such luck.<br>
This is why 75% of the cost of your average ski lift ticket is to pay<br>
for the ski areas insurance premiums. The only people who make money in<br>
the ski industry are insurance companies, injured skiers, and tort<br>
lawyers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Your argument is irrational and typical of the hacker ethic that whats</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; mine is mine and whatever I can crack, pry up, steal, or defraud from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; people is mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Tie that slander to reality.  I make no claim to anything that is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mine and never have.  In fact, I have made my honest living for 15 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as a computer programmer and writer--a producer of intellectual property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I respect that my employers believe in those laws, but I still refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to participate in my own name, because I can see beyond the justifications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and the propaganda.  I don't want to steal or defraud--I simply refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to be an accessory to the government's denying people the right to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what I have freely given them.  If I want to keep my inventions, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; protect them myself, and pay for the technologies and contracts to do it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I cannot in good conscience demand the government get out of my life in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one respect, and then come to my benefit in another.  it is dishonest,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and hypocritical, and I will have none of it.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, this means that you are an anarchist rather than a libertarian.<br>
There is SOME need for government. What form it is and how it is<br>
administered are different issues entirely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I choose not to violate the copyrights or patents of others, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they have chosen to release works into a system that makes those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; assumptions.  But that doesn't mean I won't speak out for a free-market</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-coercive means of doing business in information, just as I speak</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; out for free-market means of doing everything else big brother want</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to do for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
Show me one that works. Design a system that works. My proposal was<br>
merely trying to work within the existing system to maximize human<br>
individual liberty. I'm trying to be real about this. Trying to be ideal<br>
only gets you laughed at in politics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; When the state derives its authority from that granted by its citizens,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; as ours is by the constitution, then it is not begging, it is a mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; aid compact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yeah, yeah, the social contract, blah, blah.  Funny how libertarians</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reject such arguments for protecting real property, but are willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; allow it for IP.  It's inconsistent. </i><br>
<p>
SOrry, libertarians are all for protecting any sort of real property.<br>
Real property doesn't need as much help though for one simple reason:<br>
its real. Intellectual property is highly intangible, and therefore very<br>
vacuous and easy to steal, copy, brush off, etc. and suffers badly in<br>
environments of power imbalances and power corruption.<br>
<p>
  If you want to open a set of<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bookstores where everyone who buys agrees to respect authors' monopoly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and you don't sell to anyone who doesn't agree, then I'll be happy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you.  That might well encourage authors to publish works only in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; set of stores, giving them a market advantage.  I'd be all for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What?  You're way off buddy.  Real property is protected in an identical</i><br>
<i>&gt; fashion.  Deeds are your claim to a piece of real property - granted by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government.  Patents/copyrights are your claim/title to a piece of</i><br>
<i>&gt; IP.  Where's the distinction?</i><br>
<p>
There is none at all outside of the tangibility issue.<br>
