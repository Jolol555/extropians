<i>&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions for what Mike Cowar can do if his</i><br>
<i>&gt;parents do throw him out?  Charitable organizations that can shelter</i><br>
<i>&gt;him, places to apply for jobs and/or Welfare while he tries to get back</i><br>
<i>&gt;on track?  Legal organizations that can gain him access to his assets or</i><br>
<i>&gt;protection from his parents?  Simply having a plan for the worst case</i><br>
<i>&gt;might give him the confidence necessary to prevent it from happening. </i><br>
<i>&gt;And IN the worst case, having a plan might save his life.  Does anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;have any advice?  Has anyone here been thrown out of their home by angry</i><br>
<i>&gt;parents, and survived?  How?  What would you want to do differently?</i><br>
<p>
I recall having read an article about how it is difficult for people of<br>
orthodox jewish religion to become secular out there in the middle east and<br>
are rejected by their families. If his parents are this strict, he may<br>
unfortunetly have a long road of pain and turmoil ahead of him. It may be<br>
better to just fake his faith.<br>
