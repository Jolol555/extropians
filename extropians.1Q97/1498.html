<i>&gt; The venus post is interesting because it measures women's sexuality </i><br>
<i>&gt; against men's math abilities.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I wasn't thinking in terms of "measuring against"... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My answer would be, you perceive a kind of power she holds, </i><br>
<i>&gt; which is at least as influential as math, or any of the traditional </i><br>
<i>&gt; male domains.  </i><br>
<p>
Almost true. Venus (maybe we should say Frigga, in view of J's nordic <br>
background) has as much power as Hermes, Vulcan (her husband), etc.  <br>
She yields to Jove, however, and how she stacks up against YHWH is <br>
another matter entirely.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If she did math well, she would still have that power...  </i><br>
<p>
She already did math well, on an elementary level.  But that's not <br>
what it means to be a mathematician.  What if she were as obsessed <br>
with math as you are with art?  She would have to reorganize her mind <br>
at a very fundamental level, and it would change her feminine psyche <br>
into something else.  <br>
<p>
You have seen the Newtonian side of my personality come out a few <br>
times.  You're right, I can be abusive.  You don't know the half of it...  <br>
Can you imagine a woman with a Newtonian personality?  She might <br>
be beautiful, in a way, but she would be Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.  <br>
She might have power, but not the same power Jennifer had.  <br>
<p>
To be a mathematician, you have to form the habit of cutting through <br>
the bullshit and getting to the point.  I use the word "cut" advisedly.  <br>
It's a masculine idea.  Cut.  You do it with a sword.  Even the gentlest <br>
mathematician (most of them are much nicer than Newton) always has <br>
that sword, and at any moment his eyes may flash and cut right through <br>
you.  Jennifer could have learned to do that, but she couldn't do that <br>
and still be the magical creature that she was.  Lady MacBeth is not <br>
Venus.  <br>
<p>
David Viscott wrote a book about his experience as a medical student.  <br>
I gave the book away years ago, and can't even remember the title, but <br>
I remember an incident that illustrates what I'm trying to say:  He went <br>
to a hospital where he didn't know anybody.  I don't remember what he <br>
was doing, but he had to interview some women who worked at the <br>
hospital.  One of them stood out from the others.  Her body language <br>
was tighter, her manner more brusque, her speech clipped and to the <br>
point, her glance penetrating and comprehensive.  She had "doctor" <br>
written all over her.  Sure enough, it turned out that she was the only <br>
doctor in the group, the others were all nurses.  <br>
<p>
If you think about something all the time, it changes your personality.  <br>
It even changes you physically.  <br>
<p>
One thing I'm trying to do with the Jennifer story is to get away from <br>
the idea that this is an argument about chromosomes.  It's an argument <br>
about the mind, and the relation between mind and body.  <br>
<p>
Some little girls grow up in a hothouse environment.  Their parents <br>
want them to be pianists, or gymnasts, or ballet dancers, or swimmers, <br>
or tennis players.  They spend many, many hours practicing whatever <br>
discipline has been chosen for them.  Some of them end up Olympic <br>
champions, or Wimbledon champions.  <br>
<p>
In a few rare cases, parents want their little girls to be chess players or <br>
mathematicians.  The results prove that intensive training can turn girls <br>
into chess players or mathematicians.  The Polgar sisters are the <br>
daughters of a chess player, and Emmy Noether was the daughter of a <br>
mathematician.  They were brought up to be prodigies.  It can be done.  <br>
But at what cost?  <br>
<p>
If all little girls were brought up that way, then what would the cost be?  <br>
The assumption seems to be that when girls are brought up as girls, <br>
it somehow deprives them of the "right" to be mathematicians or <br>
engineers or truck drivers.  But if girls are taught to deny their <br>
femininity, if they are forced to be androgynous, this deprives Jennifer <br>
of the right to be Jennifer.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; you may ask yourself, why this story? why this issue.... </i><br>
<p>
This is ultimately about politics.  It's about what kind of world <br>
we want to live in.  I want to live in a world with Venus in it.  I don't <br>
want to live in a Socialist Realist world, in which we are all machines, <br>
and Jennifers are extinct.  In the modern corporate world, there is <br>
no place for Venus, except as a commodity.  I don't like that.  I am <br>
trying to understand how we got into this situation, and trying to <br>
imagine a viable alternative.  <br>
<p>
One of the Extropian presuppositions is that the mind is just a <br>
computer, and that its connection with its physical substrate is <br>
inessential.  We can reprogram ourselves, and detach ourselves <br>
from our bodies, with impunity.  I don't think so.  Hubris is always <br>
permitted, but it always has consequences.  <br>
