John thanks for your mail, it's nice to see were more on one line on this<br>
topic than in our previous argument on AAT. Your reply actually gave me new<br>
hopes for a free market system.<br>
<p>
one slight disagreement:<br>
<i>&gt;People do not like problems, they will pay money to have them solved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course the market can not solve a problem if it is not recognized &gt;as</i><br>
such, but no other system can do that either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In other words the most effort will be diverted to solving those problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;that most people judge to be most serious. As it is not reasonable to expect</i><br>
<i>&gt;to solve all of the worlds problems at the same time, that seem like an</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficient use of limited resources to me.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
i think people have a list of priority problems, and the lowest on the<br>
list, of those with money will never get solved. problem is that some of<br>
the lowest priority problems for those with money can be some of the<br>
highest priority problems for people with little money. A dangerous<br>
situation for the rich if you ask me. <br>
<p>
A good example is that of our failure to find a solution to increase the<br>
standard of life in third world countries. Is it so strange that people who<br>
live in a country where people die because there are not enough hospitals,<br>
want to move to a country where they have hospitals for their pets ? This<br>
is an example of a system without coordination on a global level. Now some<br>
people on this list want to bring that coordination back to even smaller<br>
levels of operation. Can't you see the problems that will imply ? Don't<br>
look at it from a socialist or altruistic point of view, look at it from a<br>
point of pure self interest. If we don't teach people to provide for<br>
themselves, they will come and steal the wealth from those who have it. A<br>
stable economy is just as important for poltical stability as vice versa.<br>
This also goes for smaller levels of operation. No education results in a<br>
poor standard of living, and this often results in criminal behaviour. <br>
<p>
Education is the key to the future. A pure free market system can't<br>
guarantee a fair amount of social mobility through education. As it is<br>
based on keeping the 'have nots' dumb. The more difficult it will be for an<br>
individual to break that circle the more limited his freedom if you ask me.  <br>
<p>
A free market system can work, but not without guarantees. I'm not talking<br>
about giving away things or sharing the wealth here, i'm talking about<br>
investing in people so that they will be able to work themselves into a<br>
position where they can buy more of your services or goods. Make them able<br>
to contribute to the wealth of society as a whole, instead of becoming<br>
criminals or social parasites. A free market offers no guarantees for that,<br>
however bad the state education system is, at least it does this somewhat.    <br>
<p>
A system which relies purely on charity to deal with these problems is<br>
out of date and unrealistic. I think you'll find the new generations are a<br>
lot more selfish than the older ones. Take it from me: pensions have seen<br>
their last days. (most of your US tax dollar go to this, twice as much as<br>
to the military, which comes second) Education should  be first (and maybe<br>
the only thing) on this list if you ask me.<br>
