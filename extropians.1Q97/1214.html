Eliezer sez:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
 it could be the basis of a great future-shock story.<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
I seem to recall a story by either Silverberg, Sturgeon or Farmer <br>
that dealt with almost precisely that--only it was a "universe next <br>
door" story, not a future shock story. But they weren't grown without <br>
brains--just bred for stupidity and had their tongues surgically <br>
removed (at weaning?). Protagonist falls in love with a heifer, has <br>
to deal with the fact that, nature or nurture, she's got a <br>
single-digit IQ and nothing he can do will change that now.<br>
<p>
Oh, and human dairy products are a commodity, too.<br>
<p>
A stirringly grotesque story, which is why I think Farmer wrote it, <br>
but it's about misplaced love, which is why I think of Sturgeon. <br>
Silverberg is a candidate because for a while there in the 60's he <br>
was as outrageous as anyone at the time.<br>
