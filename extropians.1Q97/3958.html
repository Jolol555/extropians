<i>&gt; If someone is a reasonable person, then the fact that they have come</i><br>
<i>&gt; to some opinion is information to you.  It is an important clue. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's what I thought I said.  It's a clue; one among many.<br>
But since I'm the one affected most by my decisions, and I'm the one<br>
who has to take responsibility for them, I'm the only one I allow<br>
to make the final decision as to which clues have better proof.  I<br>
give a very high weight to my own observations and experiences over<br>
the opinions of others. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you saying there are only a handful of people among the billions</i><br>
<i>&gt; in our world whose opinions would affect yours?  If so, you must think</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are very few reasonable people in the world.</i><br>
<p>
If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any<br>
direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually<br>
re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,<br>
there are very few of those indeed.  I see absolutely no reason<br>
why I should give any creedence at all to J. Random Ph.D. or<br>
John Q. Bestseller. <br>
