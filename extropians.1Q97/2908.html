Dear Lee Daniel Crocker and  fellow extroprians,<br>
<p>
I am new to this board, but have been reading about a week and I had to<br>
respond to your clear thinking post.<br>
<p>
Reading your response reminded me of the clarity of thought that I<br>
experienced when reading Robert Ringer's "Restoring the American Dream" 10<br>
years ago, or "Libertarianism in One Lesson" more recently.<br>
<p>
The important thing for all of us to remember is that "UTOPIA IS *NOT* AN<br>
OPTION! "<br>
<p>
No such animal exists in human civililization, and probably never will. <br>
<p>
 But the overiding issue is the use of coercive force.  The free market trys<br>
to "sell" you an idea  or an option for your life.  Governments, on the other<br>
hand, use force, corersion, and guns to force your choice.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Re:  "stability" of free market economies...<br>
<p>
Stability of the buggy whip industry may have been a goal of a few<br>
manufactuers of buggy whips, but technogy and  the free market has made this<br>
particular brand of "stability" somewhat obsolete.  And of course, technology<br>
changes everything virtually overnight. Should we mandate today's equivalent<br>
of the buggy whip to "assure stability?"<br>
  <br>
<p>
Your requesting that terms like "fair"  and "perfect" be defined to expidite<br>
genuine discussion is reasonable.  If you work twice as hard, smart, or<br>
effectively as me and gain a substantial economic advantage over me, should I<br>
consider this "fair"?<br>
<p>
Of course, most of us with libertarian/ capitalistic/ extropian oriented<br>
value systems would say, "Absolutely!" <br>
<p>
Those who define "fair" as systems that promote "equal levels of misery" as<br>
we see in controlled economies would whine, "Not fair,  Crocker has<br>
accumulated more chips than me.  Can't we pass a law to make him give some of<br>
his chips to me?" <br>
<p>
So anyway, I can't express the libertarian ideals and ideas with the cogency<br>
of Harry Browne, or Robert Ringer, or even, possibly Lee Crocker, but I<br>
wanted to tell you that I value and respect the clarity of thought you have<br>
provided.<br>
<p>
 Warmly,<br>
<p>
Rudi Hoffman<br>
