PGP has no access to primitive system functions. Assuming that pgp -w <br>
will write to exactly the same location is assuming too much, imo. It <br>
sure is probable, but it is not guaranteed even currently.<br>

<i>&gt; to move blocks around on the disk so that the new block you write is</i><br>
<i>&gt; overwriting a different free block rather than the old block of the file. </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is more likely with Unix than Windows. </i><br>
<p>
Yes. That's the reason fsck is more likely to find garbage after a hard <br>
power-off sans predcessing shutdown. But it sure increases drive <br>
performance, especially if you have lots of RAM.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and scanning the (say, deep-formatted) drive are costly </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; undertakings, not to be applied to a random miscreant. So, unless you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a major drug baron, or into mass destruction weaponry, you can sleep </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quite safely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even then, the technology was developed in the days of 40MB PC drives, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4GB. As hard disk storage density increases, the cost of recovering old</i><br>
<i>&gt; data increases dramatically. Given the kind of technology required just to</i><br>
<i>&gt; read the current data on next-generation disks I'd be surprised if anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be able to read much more than one generation back, if that. </i><br>
<p>
I think magnetic proximal probe microscopy will have little problems with <br>
current, or near future, magnetic pit size. Making sense of the signal is <br>
much harder, however. So, overwriting the same track say 10 times with an <br>
adequate pattern (random?) should give the Shop some hefty trouble. <br>
(Conc. cryptography, your drive will sure keep quiet, but will you? You <br>
know, certain people can be... persuasive. Whereas erased drives don't talk).<br>
