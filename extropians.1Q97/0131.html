I've been very disappointed with The Extropian List the last few days,  <br>
everybody is saying things I agree with. What fun is that? I really love it  <br>
when somebody says something I don't like on the net, but the net has spoiled <br>
me, when somebody says something dumb in print and I can't easily respond I <br>
don't feel exhilaration, I just feel frustration.<br>
<p>
Well my old buddy Brin has been "interviewed" in the magazine 21-C trying to <br>
drum up interest for his book on a transparent society. He was very polite in <br>
the article, I'll bet he would have been polite to me too if I had asked the <br>
same sort of tough penetrating questions like, Can you tell me more about <br>
your ideas?, or, How will The Transparent Society improve the operation of <br>
Democracy?<br>
<p>
If Brin had sent this tripe to the list each line would have been logically <br>
dissected by me or any of a dozen members of the list until nothing remained <br>
but a bloody cadaver. Earlier I said that because Brin was writing his book <br>
in a environment devoid of feedback or criticism it would be as profound as <br>
your average pop up book, now I fear I have libeled pop up books.<br>
             <br>

                                            John K Clark      johnkc@well.com  <br>
                                             <br>
PS: Yes I admit it, it's not just intellectual it's personal too, <br>
    I do not like Mr. Brin.<br>
