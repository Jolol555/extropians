<i>&gt; &gt; I would expect the new sheep to become unhealthy when their "mother"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is old and decrepit; at which point they will be younger and decrepit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh? There is no reason at all for this. I'm not even sure if the </i><br>
<i>&gt; similarities in the immune systems will have any noticeable effect; it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; quite good at randomizing its genes on its own.</i><br>
<p>
Read Ridley ("The Red Queen"), his data are quite compelling.  Length of<br>
generation is almost a direct correlation with sexual reproduction, and<br>
the genes dealing with histocompatibility and immune response are those<br>
with the greatest variation in the gene pool.<br>
<p>
While it is true that the population of immune cells in your body itself<br>
evolves to match the germs it finds, it is only able to do so because it<br>
can recognize bugs that don't have all the right passwords; but it is not<br>
possible to change the passwords themselves, because they are hard-wired<br>
into your DNA, so eventually the bugs evolve to have the right ones.  Your<br>
genes can only change the locks by producing offspring with scrambled DNA.<br>
It's a fair gamble, 50% live long enough to breed, instead of 100% dying.<br>
<p>
Just look at the lack of immune vigor in dangerously inbred species like<br>
Cheetahs.  Cloning is the ultimate inbreeding.  No variation at all, no<br>
chance for new combinations, no new locks on the old gate.  Every farmer<br>
knows the same thing about his crops: once he finds a good hybrid, he<br>
can asexually propogate it for a few years, but then it will succumb to<br>
diseases, and he must rehybridize for new vigor.<br>
<p>
Cloning for spare parts might help extend our brief lives a bit, but it<br>
doesn't change the basic fact that we are designed by evolution to grow,<br>
breed, and die.  To get past that, we need a new design entirely, not<br>
based on cells vulnerable to viral and bacterial attack.<br>
