        Right on.  I seem to take it for granted that the only way to<br>
achieve something is to kineticize my potential or shift latency into<br>
action.  This principle is the underlying (and often unacknowledged)<br>
motivation of art.  Anything that anyone does to create anything is art.<br>
What culturally defines an artist is "one who applies emotion to a medium;"<br>
I personally call this a corporeal artist.  Everyone is an artist in some<br>
way or another (I seem to recall David Musick explaining that the way he<br>
washes dishes or combs his hair fascinates him simply because he is<br>
*creating* something) though most don't make their artistry into a<br>
marketable form.<br>
<p>
        Natasha is absolutely correct when she says that "Our ideas are what<br>
make us unique."  I don't think anyone on this list can challenge that<br>
statement.  We all think differently, talk differently, walk differently,<br>
act differently et cetera, and that is something to feel proud of.  That is art.<br>
That is attainable.  Take it; mold it; feel it; taste it; love it, for it is<br>
*yours* to create and enjoy, and everyone else's to respect and appreciate.<br>
