Socialism did work for Russia in the first half of the century, (even<br>
authoritarian) but don't force me into defending a system i don't believe<br>
in. I'm just saying many polictical systems have elements that are<br>
productive and elements that are counterproductive. And that  denying that<br>
is irrational. <br>
<p>
Counterproductive policies are present in most political systems. Having a<br>
(minimal) state/ or having policies *should* allow a society  control over<br>
natural forces that become counterproductive, needless to say it's often<br>
the state that institutionalises counterproduvtive policies. Saying there's<br>
more counterproductive policies in socialist thought than in capitalist<br>
thougth i agree to wholeheartedly. Saying theres no counterproductivity in<br>
capitalist systems is denying facts, saying there will be none in any other<br>
proposed system is utopy.  <br>
'laissez faire' ideals are very high on my list of priorities, but assuring<br>
they keep working somehow is a logical goal isn't it ? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Personally i'd go with any political system that allows the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;possibilities for the realization of transhumanist goals, A system &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;that works, works.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Transhumanist goals to one side, I will not "go with" any political</i><br>
<i>&gt;system that legitimizes the use of violence to punish voluntary</i><br>
<i>&gt;and consensual exchanges without first proving a specific negative</i><br>
<i>&gt;externality.</i><br>
<p>
ALL political systems legitimize the use of violence to punish voluntary<br>
and consensual exchange to some degree (you've already stated an example<br>
later on in your reply). The problem here is that your 'specific negative<br>
externality' is a very vague concept, and may very well conflict with the<br>
both the 'voluntary' and 'consensual'  parts of your statement. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I will not "go with" any political system that treats</i><br>
<i>&gt;half the laboring time of its human population as a resource to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;disposed of at the government's whim, which is the current situation</i><br>
<i>&gt;in most of the world. </i><br>
<p>
Problem is that socialist thought is so integrated in our current societies<br>
that it may not be possible to abandon without abandoning democracy. Why<br>
spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, why not focus on ones that are<br>
acchievable instead ?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I will not "go with" any political system</i><br>
<i>&gt;that legitimizes the imprisonment of human beings for such harmless</i><br>
<i>&gt;acts as growing and selling cannabis plants. </i><br>
<p>
Well why not ? The Democracy (=majority=consensus) has decided for you that<br>
they are harmfull, just like you decide and agree with the majority other<br>
things are harmfull or 'unwanted behaviour' for other people. That's the<br>
way the system works Eric, do you publicly oppose the democratic system ?<br>
;-) (don't feel you have to answer this one)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nor will I seek a</i><br>
<i>&gt;political order in which the government loots the resources of</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-transhumanists in order to finance the pursuit of transhumanist</i><br>
<i>&gt;goals, and I will oppose those who do seek such a political order.</i><br>
<p>
Nor do i Eric, i assure you. Like you their are policies of political<br>
systems i would never 'go with', but i don't think you fully realize that a<br>
political system and it's infrastructure forms an individuals sense of<br>
Reality. His rationality, his ethics, his LOGIC are shaped to work within<br>
that system. And personally i don't see why there could have been no<br>
transhumanist movement in even a communist state, or a fascist state,<br>
ofcourse linked with ideals we would all view very sceptically.<br>
<p>
What i am saying is that transhumanist goals are very high on my list of<br>
priorities, higher maybe than political systems and their policies, but not<br>
higher than human rights and freedom. Some people on this list just place<br>
their political priorities (personal?) over the long term priotities of<br>
humanity, i guess. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I guess you didn't notice, but it seems to me that many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Americans on this list favor quite radical changes in the system</i><br>
<i>&gt;of government here...  only the changes favored are in the opposite</i><br>
<i>&gt;direction from what you are suggesting we "accept".</i><br>
<p>
Oh i did notice, i also noticed that libertarians political influence is<br>
very small, and allthough i sincerely hope that will change,  i also hope<br>
transhumanists among them do not lose their sense of reality. I don't<br>
favour socialist thought, but the majority in your country seems to do so<br>
for the moment, even though THEY may not be aware of it being socialist<br>
thought :-).<br>
<p>
ANY planning/strategy a RATIONAL organisation has, cannot allow their<br>
personal dislike of certain policies to blind themselves to these. Refusing<br>
to accept that they are there, and will be there for the immediate future<br>
to deal with, will lead to fleeing / hiding oneself in utopy, and will<br>
certainly be counterproductive...      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many of the people on this list are agorists (propertarian anarchists),</i><br>
<p>
I don't doubt the seriousness of the people on this list and the ideals<br>
they believe in. But fact remains that MOST peoples political choice is,<br>
has always been, and will always remain based on their personal financial<br>
improvement, and are perfectly willing to give up some freedom for that, as<br>
they perfectly logically mistake the organisational power of the state for<br>
financial power. Bread and circusses... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and emphatically *not* democrats. Personally, I think a "United</i><br>
<i>&gt;States of Earth" would be a political disaster, and I will do what</i><br>
<i>&gt;little I can to prevent such a behemoth from forming as long as I</i><br>
<i>&gt;live on this planet.  Constitutionally-limited representative</i><br>
<i>&gt;democracy seems to me to be the least evil form of insolent</i><br>
<i>&gt;aristocracy under which human beings have slaved and sweated their</i><br>
<i>&gt;days on Earth so far, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't.</i><br>
<p>
The Eurocracy of Europe is already forming, we now have four governements<br>
to suck us dry instead of three. Yet it's reality, and all indications<br>
point towards a continuation of this process. To deny or ignore it is<br>
silly, to oppose it, a waste of effort. It offers counterproductivity in<br>
ways of more beurocracy, and increase in productivity in ways of free<br>
trade. The monetary union will probably spice up investment levels. Only<br>
time will tell...    <br>
<p>
Again, all ideals we value i hope to one day see realized in an efficient<br>
form that works for humanity, but until that day comes (if it ever comes)<br>
we have to operate and function within the system/infrastructure we have.<br>
You in the USA are very lucky to have found a political party that supports<br>
part of your views, but i think you'll find no equivalents of libertarians<br>
in social democracies. (most european countries, and probably New Zealand)<br>
<p>
Don't forget that we're just moving out of a situation not unlike that of<br>
Athens and the Delian league. Not that i do, but publicly opposing or even<br>
questioning democracy is illegal in most other western countries. We work<br>
with the system we have, if we are to acchieve something, that is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Just say no to death and taxes.</i><br>
<p>
i keep saying no, but they keep coming back :-)<br>
