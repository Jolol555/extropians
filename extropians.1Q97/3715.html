<p>
That's fascinating.  Do you have a reference I could look at?  Were there any<br>
other such events?<br>
<p>

<p>
Depends on how fast we can expand, which isn't yet clear.<br>
<p>

<p>
Noah's Ark is a myth, remember.  You can survive in a "Noah's Ark", but a<br>
civilization can't (nor an ecology).  Complex civilizations need very large<br>
numbers of people to support them.  And imagine the chaos created if a solar<br>
system-wide civilization discovered 99.9% of the population was going to die<br>
in the near future?  I'd expect the fighting to destroy the Arks.<br>
