<i>        &gt;the experimentally confirmed Bell inequalities </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Actually, Bell's inequality has been experimentally proven to be false, <br>
just as quantum mechanics predicted and contrary to what classical physics <br>
or any local theory predicts.<br>
               <br>

<i>        &gt;demonstrate that performing a *particlar* measurement can influence         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the outcome of another measurement performed on the other side of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the galaxy.  </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
This is true, and it can do it instantly.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There are various reasons why you can't use Bell to transmit         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;information  </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Also true. If I want to send a message to a receiver 2 things must happen:  <br>
1) I must change something in the receiver. <br>
2) The receiver must be able to compare that change with something, such as   <br>
the voltage on a wire now compared to what it was a nanosecond ago.<br>
<p>
Quantum Mechanics can do #1 but not #2 , so I have just changed one "random" <br>
state in the receiver to another. The results are not really random but it <br>
would sure look that way to the receiver. It's only when the receiver  <br>
compared his results with the records of what I did, and that can only be  <br>
done at the speed of light or less, would it become obvious that what I did<br>
instantly changed what happened in the distant receiver.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;but any way you look it at, quantum mechanics and relativity are         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;having screaming catfights.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Relativity doesn't say that nothing can go faster than light, only that <br>
matter, energy or information can not, and this is none of those things.<br>
