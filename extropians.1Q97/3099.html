Stephen Wolfram, "Cellular Automata and Complexity -- Collected<br>
Papers", Adison Wesley (1994), pp. 309-328. [ an ancient post<br>
cot'd, sorry for inconveniences (if any) due to delay'd dispatch <br>
Apropos Measter W., Mathematica 3.0 for Linux, student edition is <br>
now out. I paid 350 DEM, should be much cheaper in the U.S. <br>
Purportedly, (I haven't tried out the package yet) Mathematica 3.0 <br>
offers good support for CA research ]<br>
<p>
As a first example, consider various idealizations of the system<br>
discussed above consisting of a ball rolling with friction on a<br>
landscape, now assumed one dimensional. In the approximation of a<br>
point ball, this is equivalent to a particle moving with damping in<br>
a one-dimensional potential. But the basins of attraction depend<br>
substantially on thee exact dynamics assumed. In the case of very<br>
large friction, the particle satisfies a differential equation in<br>
which velocity is proportional to force, and force is given by the<br>
gradient of the potential. In a more realistic model, with finite<br>
friction and the inertia of the ball included, the system becomes<br>
similiar to a Roulette wheel. And in this case it is known that<br>
the outcome is a sensitive function of the precise initial conditions.<br>
As a consequence, the basins of attraction corresponding for example<br>
to different holes around the wheel must have a complicated,<br>
interdigitated, form (cf. [5]).<br>
<p>
Complicated basin boundaries can also be obtained with simpler<br>
equations of motion. As one example, one can take time to be<br>
discrete, and assume that the potential has the form of a polynomial,<br>
so that the differential equation is approximated by an iterated<br>
polynomial mapping. The sequence of positions found from this<br>
mapping may overshoot the minimum, and for some values of parameters<br>
may in fact never converge to it. The region of initial conditions<br>
which evolves to a particular attractor may therefore be complicated.<br>
In the case of the complex iterated mapping z-&gt;z^2+c, the boundary<br>
of the basin of attraction (say for the attractor z=\infty) is a<br>
Julia set, and has a very complicated fractal form (e.g. [6]).<br>
<p>
The essentials of the problem of finding basins of attraction already<br>
arise in the problem of determining what set of inputs to a function of<br>
discrete variables yields a particular output. This problem is known in<br>
general to be computationally very difficult. In fact, the satisfiability<br>
problem of determining which if any assignments of truth values to n<br>
variables in a Boolean expression make the whole expression true is<br>
NP-complete, and can presumably be solved in general essentially only<br>
by explicitly testing all 2^n possible assignments (e.g. [7]). For some<br>
functions with a simple, perhaps algebraic, structure an efficient<br>
inversion procedure to find appropriate inputs may exist. But in general<br>
no simple mathematical formula can describe the pattern of inputs:<br>
they will simply seem random (cf. [8]).<br>
<p>
Many realistic examples of this problem are found in cellular automata.<br>
Cellular automata consist of a lattice of sites with discrete values<br>
updated in discrete steps according to a fixed local rule. The image<br>
processing operation mentioned above can be considered a single step<br>
in the evolution of a simple two-dimensional cellular automaton (cf.<br>
[9]). Other cellular automata show much more complicated behaviour,<br>
and it seems in fact that with appropriate rules they capture the<br>
essential features of many complex systems in nature (e.g. [1]). The<br>
basic problems of complexity engineering thus presumably already<br>
arise in cellular automata.<br>
<p>
Most cellular automata are dissipative, or irreversible so that after<br>
many steps, they evolve to attractors which contain only a subset<br>
of their states. In some cellular automata (usually identified with<br>
the classes 1 and 2), these attractors are fixed points (or limit<br>
cycles), and small changes in initial conditions are usually dampened<br>
out [10]. Other cellular automata (classes 3 and 4), however, never<br>
settle down to a fixed state with time, but instead continue to show<br>
complicated, chaotic, behaviour. Such cellular automata are unstable,<br>
so that most initial perturbations grow with time to affect the detailed<br>
configurations of an ever-increasing number of sites. The statistical<br>
properties of the behaviour produced are nevertheless robust, and are<br>
unaffected by such perturbations.<br>
<p>
It can be shown that the set of fixed points of a one-dimensional<br>
cellular automaton consists simply of all those configurations in<br>
which particular blocks of site values do no appear [11]. This set<br>
forms a (finite complement) regular language, and can be represented<br>
by the set of possible paths through a certain labeled directed<br>
graph [11]. Even when they are not fixed points, the set of all states<br>
that can occur after say t time steps in the evolution of a<br>
one-dimensional cellular automaton in fact also forms a regular<br>
language (though not necessarily a finite complement one). In addition,<br>
the basin of attraction, or in general the set of all states which<br>
evolve after t steps to a given one, can be represented as a regular<br>
language. For class 1 and 2 cellular automata, the siz of the minimal<br>
graph for this language stays bounded, or at most increases like a<br>
polynomial with t. For class 3 and 4 cellular automata, however, the<br>
the size of the graph often increases apparently exponentially with<br>
t, so that it becomes increasingly difficult to describe the basin<br>
of attraction. The general problem of determining which states evolve<br>
to a particular one after t steps is in fact a generalization of the<br>
satisfiability problem for logical functions mentioned above, and is<br>
thus NP complete. The basin of attraction in the worst case can thus<br>
presumably be found only by explicit testing of essentially all O(2^t)<br>
possible initial configurations (cf. [12]). Its form will again often<br>
be so complicated as to seem random. For two-dimensional cellular<br>
automata, it is already an NP-complete problem just to find fixed<br>
points (say to determine which n x n blocks of sites with specified<br>
boundaries are invariant under the cellular automaton rule) [13].<br>
<p>
It is typical of complex systems that to reproduce their behaviour<br>
requires extensive computation. This is a consequence of the fact that the<br>
evolution of the systems themselves typically corresponds to a<br>
sophisticated computation. In fact, the evolution of many complex systems<br>
is probably computationally irreducible: it can be found essentally only<br>
by direct simulation, and cannot be predicted by any short-cut procedure<br>
[12, 14]. Such computational irreducibility is a necessary consequence of<br>
the efficient use of computational resources in a system. Any<br>
computational reducibility is a sign of inefficiency, since it implies<br>
that some other system can determine the outcome more efficiently. <br>
<p>
Many systems in nature may well be computationally irreducible, so that no<br>
general predictions can be made about their behaviour. But if a system is<br>
to be used in engineering, it must be possible to determine in advance at<br>
least some aspects of its behaviour. Conventional engineering requires<br>
detailed specifications of the precise behaviour of each component in a<br>
system. To make use of complex systems in engineering, one must relax this<br>
constraint, and instead require only some general or approximate<br>
specification of overall behaviour. <br>
<p>
One goal is to design systems which have particular attractors. For the<br>
example of an inertialess ball rolling with friction on a landscape, this<br>
is quite straightforward (cf. [15]). In one dimension, the height of the<br>
landscape at position x could be given by the polynomial \Pi_i(x-x_i)^2,<br>
where the x_i are the desired minima, or, attractors. The polynomial is<br>
explicitly constructed to yield certain attractors in the dynamics.<br>
However, it implies a particular structure for the basins of attraction.<br>
If the attractors are close to equally spaced, or are sufficiently far<br>
apart, then the boundaries of the basins of attraction for successive<br>
attractors will be roughly half way between them. Notice, however, that as<br>
the parameters of the landscape polynomial are changed, the structure of<br>
the attractors and basins of attraction obtained can change<br>
discontinuously, as described by catastrophe theory. <br>
<p>
For a more complex system, such as a cellular automaton, it is more<br>
difficult to obtain a particular set of attractors. One approach is to<br>
construct cellular automaton rules which leave particular sequences<br>
invariant [16]. If these sequences are say of length L, and are<br>
arbitrarily chosen, then it may be necessary to use a cellular automaton<br>
rule which involves a neighbourhood of up to L-1 sites. The necessary rule<br>
is straightforward to construct, but takes up to 2^{L-1} bits to specify. <br>
<p>
Many kinds of complex systems can be considered as bases for engineering.<br>
Conventional engineering suggests some principles to follow. The most<br>
important is the principle of modularity. The components of a system<br>
should be arranged in some form of hierarchy. Components higher on the<br>
hierarchy should provide overall control for sets of components lower on<br>
the hierarchy, which can be treated as single units or modules. This<br>
principle is crucial for software engineering, where the modules are<br>
typically subroutines. It is also manifest in biology in the existance of<br>
organs and definite body parts, apparently mirrored by subroutine-like<br>
constructs in the genetic code [ check out Kauffman's "The Origins of<br>
Order", Chapter 14 (Morphology, Maps and the Spatial Ordering of<br>
Integrated Tissues) for more info on morphogenetic gadgetry -- 'gene ]<br>
<p>
An important aspect of modularity is the abstraction it makes possible.<br>
Once the construction of a particular module has been completed, the<br>
module can be treated as a single object, and only its overall behaviour<br>
need be considered, wherever the module appears. Modularity thus divides<br>
the problem of constructing or analysing a system into many levels,<br>
potentially making each level manageable. <br>
<p>
Modularity is used in essentially all of the systems to be discussed<br>
below. In most cases, there are just two levels: controlling (master) and<br>
controlled (slave) components. The components on these two levels usually<br>
change on different time scales. The controlling components change at most<br>
slowly, and are often fixed once a system say with a particular sets of<br>
attractors has been obtained. The controlled components change rapidly,<br>
processing input data according to dynamical rules determined by the<br>
controlling components. Such separation of time scales is common in many<br>
natural and artificial systems. In biology, for example, phenotypes of<br>
organisms grow by fast process, but are determined by genotypes which seem<br>
to change only slowly with time. In software engineering, computer memory<br>
is divided into a part for "programs", which ar supposed to remain fixed<br>
or change only slowly, and another part for intermediate data, which<br>
changes rapidly. <br>
