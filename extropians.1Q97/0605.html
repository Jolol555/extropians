Saith John K. Clark:<br>
<i>&gt; I agree, it has nothing to do with intelligence or Free Will or religion.  </i><br>

<p>
Exactly.  Double dissociation.  Noncomputable != religious; you can have<br>
computable souls or noncomputable minds.  And I don't share your<br>
pessimism; you seem to think that anything noncomputable is never going<br>
to be explained, but it seems to me that noncomputable things exerting<br>
causal influences on our Universe are part of the "laws of physics" and<br>
can thus be examined by the tools of science.  And I don't share your<br>
optimism; "Instantiation"/"bits" really aren't well-defined at all.  See<br>
(if it's still there) <a href="ftp://ftp.princeton.edu/pub/harnad/">ftp://ftp.princeton.edu/pub/harnad/</a><br>
<p>
Oh, and the article on analog computing being non-duplicable by Turing<br>
computers is available via FTP at:<br>

<p>
Mocking your opponent's theories is common, for various reasons; I<br>
prefer to think that you've simply become careless.  Can you demonstrate<br>
that noncomputability has any religious implications, and can you<br>
specifically demonstrate that anyone claiming noncomputability for the<br>
mind does so from religious reasons which override rationality to the<br>
point that their argument need not be considered?  The Church-Turing<br>
thesis is a mathematical formalism.  I don't see what God has to do with<br>
it.  In fact, it seems to me that any computational account of the<br>
Universe requires a God to "breathe fire into the equations and make<br>
them live" [Hawking].  Care to explain to me how *one* particular Turing<br>
machine, and not all the others, can spontaneously come into existence?<br>
