It certainly was a prerequisite.  I hate to summerize Calvin's work rather<br>
than have you read it, but it seems that pre humans got along just fine as<br>
projectile hunters using hand axes thrown discus style into groups of<br>
animals at water holes/streams for millions of years.  It was after humans<br>
started living up near the ice that Calvin thinks this method would no<br>
longer work--no waterholes when everything is covered with snow, and<br>
during part of every winter it was hunt successfully or die since that was<br>
all there was to eat (grass and animals).  In such an environment, really<br>
good projectile throwing made the difference between a line which left a<br>
lot of descendants and one which left none.  Calvin argues (very well I<br>
think) that this is what drove the expansion of the human brain, the need<br>
for enough neurons in parallel to hit small targets at a distance, and the<br>
"pumping" effect on the human genotype as the ice sheets went up and<br>
down.  I can't recommend enough that you *read* Calvin's work before<br>
arguing this topic.  Keith Henson<br>
