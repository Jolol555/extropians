I wasn't praising the value of others, nor was i saying that seeking self<br>
interest hurts others *by definition*, just that it can in some cases, as a<br>
matter of fact, i agreed with everything you said on this, but it wasn't<br>
very specific, as to where you saw contradictions to it in what i wrote...<br>

<p>
here's where i disagree, and like to point out that you yourself said you<br>
can't pursue your opwn self interest without others, so up to some point<br>
the good of the many is inherent to the good of the individual (&amp; vice<br>
versa!!!). There are situations where the good of the many limits the good<br>
of the individual, but i believe there are also situations where the<br>
opposite CAN be the case. Why is striving for a system where both<br>
situations are minimalized so bad ?<br>
<p>
Oh and don't worry, Friedman and Hayek are next on my list of purchases,<br>
but as i said before, reading them will probably only increase my postings<br>
on the subject...<br>
