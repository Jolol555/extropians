<i>&gt; I assume you don't want to debate this point. You said the same thing before,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I responded at some length explaining exactly why you were wrong, you said</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing.</i><br>
<p>
Since you said I said "nothing", I *will* debate it, briefly.<br>
1)  It is possible that consciousness is computable, but that the brain<br>
projects an energy field which survives the death of the neurons.<br>
2)  It is possible that consciousness is noncomputable, but that it<br>
still goes out like a light with the removal of the brain, and is<br>
nothing more than the interaction of the noncomputable physical<br>
particles making up the brain.<br>
3)  There are known mathematical concepts, such as "oracle machines",<br>
which violate the Church-Turing thesis in a technical sense by being<br>
able to solve the halting problem for lesser oracular ordinals, such as<br>
Turing machines.  These mathematical concepts have no religious<br>
implications.<br>
4)  Quantum randomness, if truly random, is not computable in the strict<br>
sense.  This has no religious implications and does not even *impinge*<br>
on AI, since a pseudo-random generator (or a pregenerated bit stream)<br>
would work just as well.<br>
<p>
I admit that a complete disproof of the Church-Turing thesis, in spirit<br>
as well as letter, would up the probability that we have immortal souls,<br>
for the simple reason that Turing machines definitely aren't a-priori<br>
immortal.<br>
<p>
But:<br>
1)  Challenging the Church-Turing thesis does not make me a religious<br>
lunatic;<br>
2)  Being a religious lunatic does not automatically imply that I am<br>
wrong;<br>
3)  Do *you* know how computation gives rise to consciousness?  Try to<br>
be<br>
    a bit more open-minded until you have the Final Answer!<br>

As for your explanation, I saved it and have it flagged in my list of<br>
favorite messages.  It's very interesting.  The only problem is that it<br>
applied as well to ones and zeroes as any hypothesized soul... applied<br>
far better to discrete ones and zeroes than to mysterious, and possibly<br>
inherently unified, phenomena.  I found it much easier to read as a<br>
disproof of Church-Turing, and saved it for that purpose.<br>
