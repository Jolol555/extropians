<i>&gt; Very good. Like anything pioneering, the establishment, with its</i><br>
<i>&gt; respected authority, declares newness as quackery, without scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof. It happens with ANYTHING that advances ANYTHING. The status</i><br>
<i>&gt; quoers always fear change, and will use propaganda and paranoia to</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect their status.</i><br>
<p>
And this emotional, contentless analogy is relevant to something?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; WHile you demand scientific anlysis of such quackery, you do not demand</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific analysis of your opinion of quacks. Very hypocritical and</i><br>
<i>&gt; unscientific...Using anecdotes to form your opinions?</i><br>
<p>
But I /do/ demand analysis and criticism of my opinions.  If you have<br>
anything of substance to offer, please do.  I do not, however, hold<br>
opinion--anyone's opinion--to the same standard of proof as medicine,<br>
simply because opinions don't kill people like quackery does.  If you<br>
have another opinion, please express it, and show me the facts that<br>
give rise to it, and the reason behind your conclusions from those facts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And today's quackery is often tomorrows allopathy. How many shamans</i><br>
<i>&gt; herbs are now big profit drugs?</i><br>
<p>
The ones that have been shown to work by responsible scientists. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The nature of most alternative medicines is mysticism.  Authorities</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are revered over results--the older the authority, the better.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe thats because they have centuries of anecdotal evidence that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; sum adds up to a statistical analysis.</i><br>
<p>
If they do, then they should publish those statistics in a peer-reviewed<br>
journal, search for explanations for why they work, test them under<br>
varying conditions, and otherwise behave like scientists so that they<br>
can /show/ us that they work, not just /tell/ us.  Authority by itself<br>
is utterly meaningless.  Authorities in science gain stature by how<br>
often their ideas come to coincide with reality, and how often others<br>
try to disprove them and fail.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; And "Allopathic" doctors know the power of the placebo to heal. Pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith has the property to induce the body to heal itself. I know an</i><br>
<i>&gt; anesthesiologist who is a good freind, who just was confirmed into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Catholic Church because he finally had one too many experiences of so</i><br>
<i>&gt; called "miracles" happen before his eyes. One was a patient who had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; near death experience come back to tell him many things about his own</i><br>
<i>&gt; family members who were dead. WEIRD. I can't say I beleive him, but he</i><br>
<i>&gt; is one of your so called "allopathic" scientific doctors.</i><br>
<p>
If his Catholicism is for reasons of family or culture, I might<br>
forgive a moment of weakness.  But if he honestly expresses to me<br>
the belief that theology is a proper method of epistemology, I<br>
would not hesitate to find myself another doctor.  But I suspect<br>
that he still thinks leprosy is an infection and not a judgment <br>
from God; that he does not believe in the virgin birth.  In short,<br>
I suspect that the same abilities of his mind that led him to<br>
become a doctor rather than a psychic healer are still there, even<br>
if he is momentarily confused by emotional reactions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And how many "allopathic" medical procedures eventually turn out to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; more harmful than helpful to patients? let me count the ways......</i><br>
<p>
Quite a few.  There's a whole field of medicine called iatrogenics,<br>
devoted to conditions caused by medical treatment.  But that field<br>
of medicine evolved precisely because doctors saw the reality of it,<br>
and created the study based on the facts as they were, not based<br>
upon old authorities or prejudices or mystic theories.  Knowlege<br>
changes as facts emerge.  This is not a reason to reject our earlier<br>
reasoning--indeed it is an opportunity to verify it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; how many drugs are indtroduced which have more harmful side effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here's some shocking statistics for you: Over 10,000 people die each</i><br>
<i>&gt; year due to prescribed drugs conflicting, inducing allergic reactions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or being switched. Guess how many people died from nutritional</i><br>
<i>&gt; supplements, herbs, marijuana use, and natural hormonal supplements: 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they were both from Ma Huang taken in overdose.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WHich is more harmful?</i><br>
<p>
Shameful abuses of medicine by doctors who should know better has<br>
utterly nothing at all to do with the moral deficiency of alternative<br>
practitioners.  I refuse to sacrifice my mind to "us/them" thinking.<br>
Taking sides is an intellectually lazy way to avoid finding principles.<br>
<p>
You fail to consider the lives lost by those who forsake traditional<br>
medicine for the sake of admittedly harmless but ineffective alternatives.<br>
Sure, nobody ever died taking feverfew, but how many took it instead<br>
of seeing a doctor and died of pneumonia?  Nobody died from Laetrile,<br>
but how many people died of the cancer they were treating with it<br>
because they abandoned radiation and chemo?  How many people have <br>
masked minor aches and pains with DMSO and later found a serious cause<br>
too late to treat it?<br>
<p>
And in the long run, how much brain power has been wasted memorizing<br>
chi lines that could have been devoted to studying something that<br>
might have actually helped people?  How much money has been spent on<br>
garlic tablets that might have been spent at a hospital that does<br>
real research?<br>
<p>
I don't have numbers on any of that, because my arguments were not<br>
pragmatic, but moral.  I suspect, though, that the pragmatic costs<br>
of the flawed reason of alternative practitioners is significant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A child with a ruptured spleen can choose either the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; scientifically verified method of surgery, or the older authoritative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; method of prayer.  There are no guarantees either way, but odds are he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will survive in the first case and die in the second.  A woman with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; headaches may well find comfort and ease of pain with acupuncture.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; if they were caused by a brain tumor, her delay in seeking reponsible</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; diagnosis could kill her.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet healthful, nutritionally balanced living will prevent both.</i><br>
<p>
Nutrition won't stop you from getting into a car crash, or from<br>
getting any number of organic diseases like cancer.  Germs find<br>
everyone; viruses find everyone.  100% prevention is not possible.<br>
When the inevitable disease does happen, I will use the standard<br>
of reason, not mythology, to choose my course of action, and I hold<br>
others to the same standard of action.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Acupuncture is scientifically recognised to reduce pain by stimulating</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural production of endorpins.</i><br>
<p>
It may well be possible to stimulate such production by means of<br>
needles (though I suspect it is a placebo effect).  That doesn't<br>
mean that studying lines of chi is moral.  It means that some old<br>
folks may have stumbled onto to something that worked, and then<br>
invented a mythology to justify it, rather than using proper<br>
reason to prove it and find out why.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally, I think that you are ignorant and are just spouting off. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly suggest that you do some real balanced research on what studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been done. Your opinion does not equal the weight of the studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; that have been done by real MDs and PhDs and ARE out there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was once a big skeptic like you, but I was also ignorant. I then did</i><br>
<i>&gt; some research, and my opinion changed.</i><br>
<p>
I am not a skeptic, I am a rationalist.  And I must repeat myself,<br>
because I keep being misinterpreted: it is /not/ any specific practice<br>
that may or may not work to which I object; it is the method by<br>
which it is evaluated that matters.  It is the methods of the quacks<br>
who list anecdotes and wildly anti-scientific jargon on labels that<br>
make them morally deficient.  Some of this stuff, as you quite<br>
properly point out, might actually work.  But the charlatans are<br>
more interested in selling bottles and books than in doing the real<br>
research to prove it or disprove it.  I have nothing but respect for<br>
honest scientific researchers who investigate anything strange.  And<br>
I have nothing but disdain for those who sell false hope to the<br>
sick /before/ the research is in, and who use deliberate evasions<br>
of reality to boost their sales.<br>
<p>
Another chant I contantly hear from mystics is to "keep an open<br>
mind".  But isn't the mystic, who tenaciously clings to a belief<br>
after years and years of evidence to the contrary, the one who is<br>
closed-minded to the possibility of reaching a conclusion other<br>
than the one he started with?  Mystics start with conclusions;<br>
skeptics never reach them; a rationalist makes rational conclusions<br>
from evidence and reason.<br>
<p>
I like one of Sagan's analogies: Fred claims that there is a<br>
fire-breathing dragon in his garage.  We open the door and see<br>
nothing.  "Oh, it's an invisible dragon" he says.  OK, then we'll<br>
spread sawdust on the floor and look for footprints.  "Oh, it's<br>
a weightless invisible fire-breathing dragon".  Well, let's raise<br>
a fog in the room, and see if we can see its outline.  Sorry,<br>
it's a non-corporeal dragon.  Hmm.  Can we measure the temperature<br>
in the garage when he breathes?  No, it's not that kind of fire.<br>
<p>
A mystic would say "There's a dragon, trust me.  Someday I'll<br>
find a way to prove it to you.  Until then, I'll just assume it."<br>
A skeptic would say "There is no dragon until you prove it to me<br>
beyond any shadow of a doubt, and even then it might be illusory."<br>
A rationalist, like me, says "There might be a dragon, but your<br>
method of reasoning is flawed.  I will not act on the assumption<br>
that there is a dragon until I have some evidence--reasoning<br>
from facts to concepts, not the other way around.  Until then, I<br>
feel quite comfortable concluding that there's no damned dragon."<br>
