Anders:<br>
<i>&gt;A "being" moving at lightspeed would exist in a universe with just a</i><br>
<i>&gt;single moment of time and 2 spatial dimensions; </i><br>
<p>
A&lt;-(1)-&gt;B<br>
<p>
If there is no distance between the points in spacetime<br>
(Why is that?)<br>
I do not need to travel through a distance of time(1)<br>
<p>
A&lt;-(0)-&gt;B<br>
<p>
also because there is only one spacial dimension,<br>
<p>
A&lt;-(0)-&gt;A<br>
<p>
which is the point of light.<br>
<p>
A<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;, but it doesn't mean that the universe is a single point (if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was, how come I'm not telling you this face to face?). </i><br>
<p>
(Ignoring the impossiblity of two faces of one point.)<br>
There are too many mediums between us, too much distortion.<br>
It is possible for light to bounce off you and into my eye,<br>
but for me to rearrange the patterns <br>
to their original form would be difficult.<br>
If it were to travel though a consistant medium, say fiber-optics,<br>
It would be much easier.<br>
<p>
I get the feeling light is not the fastest thing.<br>
Why is it we can see light move from A to B,<br>
but a light being can not?<br>
I believe the fastest thing should appear to be one point,<br>
no matter if it is viewed internally or externally.<br>
(If you must attack me for my independant thinking <br>
please refrain from insults,<br>
just prove me wrong with a paragraph)<br>
<p>
I know the subject of light was probably worn out long ago,<br>
but interactive learning is SO much better for me.<br>
I have become "spoiled".<br>
I used to spend four hours a day at <a href="http://www.search.com">http://www.search.com</a>  .<br>
Now I rarely need to look beyond this list <br>
or the few transhumanist's bookmarks I have.<br>
I do not like to read a book <br>
and to disagree with some thing on page one.<br>
I lose some respect for the authors<br>
when I have to read things I believe are wrong.<br>
<p>
Some more questions:<br>
<p>
Why is a lightwave so fast?<br>
<p>
Does it ever slow down?<br>
If it does, is it still light?<br>
<p>
Why is a wave called light when we see it, <br>
sound when we hear it,<br>
heat when we feel it?<br>
It's still just a wave, is it not?<br>
<p>
Why do we say: see, hear, smell, taste, feel<br>
when we are really only feel it?<br>
<p>
Light creates heat and sound, <br>
heat creates sound and light, <br>
sound creates light and heat.<br>
<p>
Has any one thought of the grand unification theory yet?<br>
