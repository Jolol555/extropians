I responded to Chris Hind:<br>
<i>&gt; I really think you need to understand something at at least a basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; level before you can reject it this strongly.  Strauss &amp; Howe do give</i><br>
<i>&gt; a plausible causal influence story, they don't try to explain ...</i><br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker responded:<br>
<i>&gt;This is really too much.  You described the book as "resonating" with</i><br>
<i>&gt;your own feelings, offering no epistemology by which it should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;properly judged, and then you criticize someone else for dismissing it</i><br>
<i>&gt;based on his feelings. ... I judged it by its flawed reasoning,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and my emotional reaction to that evaluation followed.</i><br>
<p>
I respect your grounds for rejecting the book, that they haven't<br>
presented their theory and evidence in a formal enough way to meet<br>
your standards of persuasion.  Chris, on the other hand, seems to just<br>
be seriously mistaken about what the book says.   <br>
<p>
I have said nothing even close to liking the book because of<br>
`"resonating" with your own feelings'.  Please provide a direct quote.<br>
