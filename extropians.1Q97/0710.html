Well, once it reaches equlibrium it will emit 1200W/m^2, the amount of<br>
energy it absorbs from sunlight (AFAIR). James is correct that that is a<br>
lot more energy than would be returned from a radar signal. However, an IR<br>
detector is going to be much smaller (say, 1m^2) than a radar receiver and<br>
that will compensate to a small extent. Most important is that you're only<br>
getting a power-of-two attenuation and not power-of-four. <br>
<p>
Let's see... if the frontal area of the warhead is 0.5 m^2, then it will<br>
emit 600W, which will be down to 600/(2*pi*(4*10^8)^2) ~ 6 * 10^-16 W/m^2<br>
at the lunar surface if it's just left Earth. I don't know how much power<br>
you'd need to detect the warhead, but if we assume a microwatt again then<br>
we'll need to reduce the distance by around 10^5, which would bring the<br>
detection range down to about 4-10km. That seems too small to me. Anyone<br>
know more about IR sensors than I do and want to check my sums?<br>
<p>
However, there are ways to get around this. For example, we could build a<br>
sunshield perpendicular to the warhead's trajectory which would reflect<br>
most of the IR away in directions that the lunar folx couldn't detect. We<br>
could also pack the warhead with liquid helium to cool the casing down to<br>
near-background temperatures before it reached detection range. The main<br>
concern would be how far we could drop the temperature of the warhead<br>
before the hardware would malfunction, and since emission has a<br>
power-of-four factor again even halving the temperature would cut the<br>
emission from 600W to about 30W. <br>
<p>
Finally, of course, it wouldn't be against the background of space as it's<br>
coming from Earth and would obviously be against the warm background of<br>
Earth itself, at least until it neared the moon. This may make life easier<br>
for you if I did cool the warhead down, of course. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes it is quite small, and could easily be formed into the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; stealthed shapes that Mark is puportin for nukes.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but we don't really care because we've been assuming all along that <br>
"the rock always gets through".<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Considering that the Nuclear winter effects are caused by the dust</i><br>
<i>&gt; thrown up,</i><br>
<p>
Didn't we cover this a year or so ago? Nuclear winter is far from proven <br>
and in fact seems quite unlikely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and that simulations have shown that a limited exchange of</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than 10,000 kt would have significant environmental effects (this</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited exchange was considered to be a strictly military conflict)</i><br>
<p>
The same nuclear winter simulations proved that millions of people were<br>
going to starve to death in Asia after Iraqui troops set the Kuwait oil<br>
fields alight. As this was totally untrue, I have little faith in their<br>
models. Garbage in, garbage out, as one of my computer science tutors used<br>
to keep telling us. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think your estimates are being inflated again simply to bolsteryour won</i><br>
<i>&gt; position.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly. Your mass-driver would take years to launch that many rocks. Even<br>
if the nuclear winter theories are correct they assume that the explosions<br>
all happen in one day, and the effects would be greatly reduced when<br>
they're spread over years. <br>
<p>
Anyway, James just showed that rocks of that size will be slowed so much <br>
by the atmosphere that the question is immaterial. You're now down from <br>
10,000 tons per rock to nearer 0.1 ton.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A 10 MT device will only have a damage area of between 4-8 times larger</i><br>
<i>&gt; than a 300 KT device, which is why the powers have gotten away from</i><br>
<i>&gt; using big nukes, as they are not as cost effective as using the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of material in four or more devices.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I mentioned this a few days ago. But small nukes are nowhere near as <br>
effective against deeply-buried structures, and the cost of launching <br>
numerous small nukes to the moon will probably be much higher than launching <br>
just a few large ones. Of course, if we launch 100 rather than 10 we'd have <br>
a much greater chance of doing at least some damage to your colony. <br>
 <br>
As I think I mentioned earlier, the reason I originally picked 10MT was<br>
just that I happened to have the figures for crater size handy. I don't<br>
have them for smaller bombs. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While I do not know how to calculate the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; or estimated equivalence, I think that this is a significant factor to</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider.</i><br>
<p>
I don't care, because all that really matters to me is the crater size and<br>
James figures seemed to scale to roughly the same values as on Earth. The<br>
only disadvantage is that I'd have a harder time destroying your<br>
mass-driver. *However* just think what my EMP will do to your<br>
multi-kilometer long string of superconducting coils? I may not even need<br>
to hit it to destroy it. James? <br>
