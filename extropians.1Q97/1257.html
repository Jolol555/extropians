<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
What I've always heard is that "politically correct" started as a <br>
joke<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
*cough*<br>
<p>
&lt;Destry looks at his sixguns for a looong loong time...&gt;<br>
<p>
I repeat, "Was you _dere_, Fritz?" Did you read publications being <br>
circulated on college campuses in the '60s and '70s? Do you know <br>
anyone whose hands don't work right anymore because of years in <br>
Siberia after conviction on a charge of political incorrectness? I <br>
know I've done the first, and I _believe_ I qualify on the second <br>
count, but I can't bring myself to broach the question directly to <br>
that person--I'm not close enough to him to feel like it would be <br>
other than a ghoulish mini-spectacle.<br>
<p>
I'll do my best to find you cites if you like. I remember reading <br>
translations of Maoist writings in the 70's and they didn't sound <br>
like they were joking. Does the term "revisionist" ring a bell? Are you at all <br>
cognizant that revisionism was worth the death penalty if the Red <br>
Guard decided you had been too successful at it?<br>
<p>
What authority would you accept for authentication of my claim?<br>
Do I have to track down some Ukrainian NKVD/KGB has-been, and deliver <br>
him to your door, or will a paper trail do?<br>
<p>
I have a friend whose parents were-are authentic Reds, scholars and <br>
activists (and college professors, both of 'em), of Hungarian extraction. <br>
His mother is, I believe, still living. Shall I have her write you a note?  <br>
<p>
I'm serious, here. <br>
<p>
Do you have any conception of how deadly-serious the official <br>
policies of the USSR and the PRC were, whenever it suited whoever was <br>
turning the crank on the torture-lobotomy-forced labor machine?<br>
<p>
(note: of *course*, there was selective enforcement; but the first <br>
rule was "be _quiet_").<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;<br>
themselves, or about other leftists who didn't have as much humor.<br>
Then either the latter leftists took the phrase seriously and started<br>
using it or someone on the right thought the laughing leftists were<br>
using it as serious condemnation and things took off from there.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's the "sanitization" I'm talking about. But the <br>
less-serious leftists were mocking the _real_ sentiment of the <br>
more-serious ones: that only "*true*" Marxist(-Leninist, -Maoist) <br>
thought was tolerable, and in particular that deviations must be <br>
pruned, brutally if need be. Ever hear about Beria and Trotsky? <br>
<p>
Of course, there were relatively few pogroms and hardly _any_<br>
work-till-you-drop camps in Berkeley, etc. Bully for them.<br>
<p>
Assuming that it was all a joke is comforting, I suppose.<br>
<p>
Eppur si muove. If it's all a myth, I'll buy you a dinner, $100 <br>
limit, gratuity and tax included. What odds do you offer?<br>
<p>
MMB (old fart), at but not for OCC<br>
