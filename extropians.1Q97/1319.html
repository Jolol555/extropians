[Lyle Burkhead:]<br>
<i>&gt; I think they were assuming that you had some experience of life, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; some knowledge of the history of science, in which case their point </i><br>
<i>&gt; would indeed be obvious.  Experience will only come with time, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but I have given you the basic facts about who the geniuses are in </i><br>
<i>&gt; one field, mathematics.  The facts about other fields are similar. I am </i><br>
<i>&gt; bothering to argue, and I would be interested to see your response. </i><br>
<p>
My response is, as always, "Insufficient Data".  I acknowledge that<br>
there are major, evolved, emotional differences between the sexes,<br>
although not necessarily ones that could not be overcome by upbringing. <br>
In fact, I seem to recall running through several case histories of<br>
feminized boys and androgenized women, some of which were (as far as<br>
known) upbringing-induced and not a testosterone imbanance.  Certainly,<br>
just as an example, the standard for women, regardless of culture, is to<br>
choose mates carefully... though there are veterans of the Sexual<br>
Revolution who may choose otherwise.  And the standard for men is to<br>
sleep with anything that moves... though many die virgins of their own<br>
free will.<br>
<p>
My objection to this whole discussion is that, scientific as it may<br>
sound, factual as our intentions may be, ultimately you're going to be<br>
put in the position of saying to some woman:  "You can never be a<br>
mathematical genius 'cause it ain't in your genes."  Or of saying to<br>
some man:  "You'll never be a great housekeeper because it ain't in<br>
*your* genes."  Of saying to some teenager:  "You don't have the<br>
experience in life to argue whether woman can be mathematicians."<br>
<p>
That's no better than the psychiatrist who proffers an elaborate<br>
emotional explanation for the actions of a rational person and then uses<br>
his "medical" authority to override that person's will on the basis of<br>
his explanation.  It doesn't matter if the person is well-intentioned<br>
and honestly believes he's as much a doctor as a surgeon. <br>
Well-intentioned people do horrible things all the time.<br>
<p>
Psychiatry is a direct attack on who a person is, so that my instinctive<br>
retaliation is not to punch the other in the nose or even to kill him<br>
but to erase him from the stream of Time, so that he never existed and<br>
never hurt me.  It's not just overriding the will of another with your<br>
own.  It's erasing the will of the other person from reality by offering<br>
an alternate explanation, so that what everyone else believes is that<br>
your will was really this-and-that.  Psychiatry erases a person from<br>
existence.<br>
<p>
And, generalizations based on class or gender or race or even age are<br>
just as bad.  Some of them may even be facts, but they have to<br>
overridable facts.  If I say "I'm not a teenager" or a prospective<br>
mathematician says "I'm not a woman" or an agnostic says "I'm not<br>
Catholic", to continue in the generalization based on what *you* think<br>
is worse than evil.  To override the existence of another in that way<br>
corrupts the soul, to introduce an entropian phrase.  Perhaps you would<br>
be more comfortable with "destroys the mind, reduces your respect for<br>
the individual, and changes you definitely for the worse".  It's an<br>
entropian act, an Evil one, and in the end it *doesn't* *matter* how<br>
much scientific backing you had for your generalization.  *People* take<br>
precedence over *generalizations*!  A living, breathing, sentient mind<br>
has the right to be judged on its own merits, and not casually *erased*<br>
based on what other people did!<br>
<p>
I believe that the truth takes precedence.  But I don't believe that<br>
this applies to conversation or any interactions with others, only to<br>
self-honesty.  I perceive no ethical problem in freely concealing the<br>
existence of weapons or ideas.  (Note:  Conceal ideas *you* have, not<br>
suppress the ideas of others.  Drexler, for instance, wisely and<br>
ethically kept his mouth shut about nanotechnology until he decided nano<br>
*would* arrive and the only question would be how much forethought had<br>
been done about gray goo.)  To quote my own humble opinion, one should<br>
never publish a statistic about how many rapes are required to produce a<br>
single living baby.  It's a valid statistic on which valid plans for<br>
social action might be based, but it's still a dangerous statistic that<br>
should never be published.<br>
<p>
It goes to the core of a human's existence that whatever statements can<br>
be made about you are only probabilities, and that by choosing to do<br>
something different, you can break the probabilities.  It is, if I may<br>
wander very briefly into cognitive science, inherent in our concept of<br>
causality that there is a default situation which you alter by doing A<br>
and then B happens; this is what we mean by A causes B.  An unbreakable<br>
default with respect to a person removes that person's feeling of free<br>
will; it smashes any self-concept based on free-will; it destroys your<br>
awareness of the effect of your actions; it turns your mind into an<br>
epiphenomenal gremlin; it erases you from the Universe.<br>
<p>
No.  I refuse.  I refuse to discuss stereotypes and I refuse to take<br>
actions based on stereotypes.  If I was researching this problem on my<br>
own with an eye to doing something about it, I would freely think<br>
internally about statistics and causes and fixes.  But the moment<br>
anybody stood up and said:  "This doesn't apply to me", that would be<br>
*all*, that would be *done*, and it wouldn't matter if I thought my<br>
ideas were the equivalent of the laws of *physics*.  I may ask for an<br>
explanation of why X doesn't apply to you, and if an explanation is not<br>
forecoming, I may invent a *private* explanation of why X really does<br>
apply to you.  But I shall never pronounce it aloud.  If this means that<br>
I lose a few arguments; if this means that a few schizophrenics receive<br>
the death penalty instead of appropriate medication; if a refusal to<br>
acknowledge a problem results in the destruction of human civilization;<br>
so be it.  Some things take precedence.<br>
