WACO FLIR: AN EXPERT'S ANALYSIS<br>
<p>
This is Dr. Edward Allard's analysis of the Waco FLIR<br>
(Forward Looking InfraRed) video.  The first 4 points<br>
describe his experience, in 6 through 12 he describes<br>
FLIR events, and in 13 gives his conclusion.  While<br>
Dr. Allard describes only a few FLIR muzzle flashes<br>
here, the defense team has now identified 66 shots<br>
almost all toward the building, 44 of which are<br>
after the fire starts.  --  Ian Goddard<br>

DECLARATION OF EDWARD F. ALLARD, PhD.<br>
<p>
Edward F. Allard declares and states as follows:<br>
<p>
1. My name is Edward F. Allard. I have worked for many years in the<br>
field of radiation physics related to thermal imaging, thermal signatures,<br>
thermal suppression and especially in aspects of those subjects relating<br>
to Forward Looking Infrared [FLIR] military systems.<br>
<p>
2. My experience is set forth in my curriculum vitae, which is attached<br>
to this declaration. I received my Bachelor of Science in physics from<br>
Boston College and my doctorate in physics from the University of Missouri.<br>
I hold Patent No. 4,413,668 on a device to suppress thermal signatures<br>
and Patent no. 5,013,092 on a microdischarge image intensifier. My<br>
inventions and studies will enable use of uncooled thermal imagers with<br>
predicted performance better than the current TOW antitank missile night<br>
sight; design and calculation for these required an expert knowledge of<br>
photocathodes, photo detectors, signal detection, noise, charge transfer<br>
and optics for thermal imaging devices.<br>
<p>
3. I began my career in this field as a supervisor at the Defense<br>
Department's Night Vision Laboratory, later becoming Deputy Director,<br>
Systems Development. My team developed and defended a variety of programs<br>
in the area, including L3TV systems, the thermal night sight for the<br>
Dragon antitank weapon, the night sight for the TOW antitank missile<br>
system, and other programs. NVL pioneered the Common Module System that<br>
is the foundation of the thermal imaging systems used in Operation Desert<br>
Storm.<br>
<p>
4. As a defense contractor and government employee, I have analyzed a<br>
number of thermal imaging devices. These include comparisons of L3TV<br>
with thermal imagers, comparisons of American and foreign imagers,<br>
analyses of the thermal imager for the M1 tank, design of thermal<br>
pointing systems, construction of a T-62 thermal target for tank<br>
gunnery, and countermeasures to completely hide an M60 tank from enemy<br>
FLIR and to reduce FLIR signatures of tents, trucks, ships, and<br>
individual soldiers.  The interpretation of FLIR imagery requires skill<br>
and experience. As but a few examples, materials which reflect sunlight<br>
and thus seem bright in the visible spectrum will often appear indistinct,<br>
or even dark, to a thermal imager; the very reflective properties that<br>
make them bright to the eye make them appear cool, and thus dark, to<br>
FLIR systems. Interpretation of thermal images requires a knowledge<br>
of the reflective properties of both natural and man-made objects.<br>
<p>
5. I have reviewed a FLIR tape depicting the events outside Waco, Texas,<br>
on April 19, 1993, which tape was obtained from one of the defense<br>
attorneys involved in the criminal cases that arose out of those events.<br>
My analysis of the tape follows. All times given are those shown in the<br>
timeclock shown in the tape. All directions are given from the standpoint<br>
of the viewer.<br>
<p>
6. At 11:24:31, the FLIR is recording events in the rear of the building,<br>
where the Combat Engineering Vehicle [CEV] has partially demolished the<br>
area known as the "gymnasium." The FLIR shows several flashes appearing<br>
from a point to the left of the CEV. These are elongated in shape, several<br>
feet long, and appear and disappear at a regular rate with regular spacing<br>
between them. I note five flashes from one point, appearing and disappearing<br>
at the rate of 7-10 per second. At this location some non-flashing movement<br>
also appears visible. There is no natural explanation for these flashes.<br>
Natural phenomena do not heat and cool in fractions of a second. My expert<br>
opinion is that these flashes appear to be the muzzle flashes of a fully-<br>
automatic firearm, firing at about 500 rounds per minute cyclic rate.<br>
Carefully examined, in slow motion and by frame-to-frame observation, the<br>
flashes originate to the left and progress to the right, indicating that<br>
they are being fired from a source outside the building, and fired into<br>
the building.<br>
<p>
7. At 11:42:56, the aircraft bearing the FLIR is circling the side of the<br>
building. A hot image is visible inside the side, ground floor, window of<br>
the "corner tower." As the aircraft continues its movement the image<br>
vanishes, underscoring the fact that the image is a hot object inside the<br>
room, the sight of which is lost as the aircraft moves on and alters the<br>
perspective through the window.<br>
<p>
8. At 11:44:52, a momentary flash of radiation is seen to the rear of the<br>
central "tower." This may be at a location in the open area to the immediate<br>
rear of the building. The flash is visible for ten frames, approximately a<br>
third of a second, much longer than the flashes described above. It is not<br>
possible with these data to determine the cause or source of the flash.<br>
<p>
9. At 11:47:50, the FLIR is recording events at the front of the building. A<br>
CEV has driven into the building, withdrawn, and has a large piece of rubble<br>
lodged on the front of the vehicle. An individual is dimly visible exiting<br>
the vehicle, walking to its front, and dislodging the rubble. The CEV is at<br>
this point halted within a vehicle length, perhaps twenty feet, of the front<br>
of the building.<br>
<p>
10. At 12:07:40-42, the aircraft bearing the FLIR is circling past the right<br>
tower. A heat source, long and narrow in form, quickly appears across a<br>
window of the tower. Upon careful examination, slow motion and frame-by-<br>
frame, I believe this is more likely to be a heat source outside the window,<br>
than one inside it. It is noteworthy that the image does not vanish or fade <br>
as the aircraft flies past, in contrast to the heat signature noted at <br>
11:42:56.<br>
<p>
11. At 12:08:32, the FLIR depicts events at the rear of the building, where<br>
the large "gymnasium" structure has largely been demolished. Two very bright<br>
thermal flashes are visible near to or in the window at the center, in front<br>
of and to one side of the CEV which is stopped there. I see no natural<br>
explanation for these flashes. They would not, for instance, be reflections<br>
of sunlight off glass.<br>
<p>
12. At 12:08:52 there are again radiation flashes, which I believe to be<br>
firearms fire, from the side and rear of the CEV.  Again, when carefully<br>
examined they appear to move in the direction of the building.<br>
<p>
13. In brief, my examination of the FLIR tape indicates:<br>
<p>
a. An analysis of the tape, field by field, reveals thermal flashes<br>
occurring that have pulse times and time intervals between them<br>
consistent with the intervals of automatic weapons fire. Pulses of<br>
approximately 1/15 second occur. There are no naturally-<br>
occurring phenomena that could explain these events.<br>
<p>
b. Other thermal flashes of radiation, approximately 1/3 second in<br>
duration, occur in various areas of the building complex. Again,<br>
no naturally-occurring phenomena can explain this.<br>
<p>
I declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct.<br>
<p>
