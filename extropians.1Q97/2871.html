<i>&gt; The most common concern about PPLs is that is that local competition</i><br>
<i>&gt; will soon result in local authoritarian monopolies, which may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to get rid of.  This seems to be the result of protection</i><br>
<i>&gt; agency like competition now in Russia.  Another concern is defense</i><br>
<i>&gt; free riding among PPLs making an area vulnerable to invaders.  So it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not *obvious* we aren't better off with some sort of minarchy.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; given minarchy, its not obvious how small a government we can actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; have.</i><br>
<p>
In what way is it "difficult" to simply stop paying a private business?<br>
If you're going to raise objections to A-C, how about raising some that<br>
might actually exist instead of making them up?  Russian mafias believe<br>
in territoriality; they are not a free market.  Free riders are a minor<br>
nuisance of the market that is exaggerated to the scale of major failure<br>
to discredit it because the opposition can't come up with much better.<br>
Lighthouses, dams, roads, and bridges get built with private money now,<br>
despite both the free-rider "problem" of the market and the confiscatory<br>
tax rates of the state.  We can get rid of the latter problem, but that<br>
doesn't make the former problem worse, it makes it better.<br>
