I like this type of analysis.  But I don't know that the conclusion is quite<br>
justified.  I see two problems: 1) One does not have to come up with an <br>
idea that is better than /everybody/ else's, just an idea that is better<br>
than one's local peers for evolution to function.  2) Usable-idea space<br>
is so much larger now than then, the proportions may actually be the<br>
reverse of what you suggest.<br>
