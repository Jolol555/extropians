This reply is just a little narrow. By definition we will probably all be a<br>
part and a parcel of the Head Neuron as you prefer to call it. To deny that<br>
this is happening even today is to deny that we will all use similar<br>
components and to deny the leading role of design. I am only committed by<br>
history to changing its course however insignificantly and your point is<br>
taken, however "being a slave to Leviathan" are loaded words, you know.<br>
