<i>&gt;Did anyone videotape any of the episodes of Future Fantastic in which we</i><br>
<i>&gt;appeared? The BBC producer who made the show seems to have vanished and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;never received copies. Not having cable TV, we didn't see the shows. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;could loan us them -- to be returned promptly -- we'd be grateful.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;Hey Max,</i><br>
<p>
I got the one with you two in it on tape. It aired the night we went out.<br>
its also re-airing currantly and I'll attempted to capture as many of them,<br>
being as I already missed the first one again, as I can. plus you wanted<br>
the "immortality on ice" docu on Alcor so you might as well take that one<br>
too.<br>
