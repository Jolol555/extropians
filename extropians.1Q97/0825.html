<i>&gt; &gt;I used "dangerous" to mean "destructive of reason, and counter to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;goal of human progress".  Perhaps "destructive" would have been a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;better word.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; This doesn't get you out of your contradiction. Certainly if words can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be destructive of reason and counter to the goal of human progress, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; words can hurt people.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, in that sense, I expressed a contradiction.  Since the meme stifles<br>
progress and free inquiry, it results in harm.  Language is an imperfect<br>
medium, English moreso, and my command of English below that.  Let's<br>
see if I can parry your jab here.<br>
<p>
To be precise, let's put the meme this way: "Words which honestly<br>
express ideas of a speaker may provoke unpleasant emotional reactions<br>
in some listeners, and it is therefore advisable to not express those<br>
ideas."  The delimma of psychological causality does complicate matters,<br>
but the nature of the bad meme is clear: the meme says shut up because<br>
you might cause offense.<br>
<p>
So the meme, then, must be attacked not because "words cause harm" is<br>
objectively false, but because (1) is mislocates the harm: the listener's<br>
emotional reaction is not "harm", it's just the way he is, and (2) it<br>
prescribes the wrong remedy: silence, rather than tolerance.<br>
<p>
Now the ways in which the meme is expressed are varied, but some variant<br>
of "Don't say that, you'll hurt his feelings", or "If you can't say<br>
something nice..." are common.  The opposing meme, that a listener should<br>
be tolerant, is found in expressions like "Sticks and stones..."  I much<br>
prefer the latter.<br>
