I must confess to being one who occasionally fussed about Boundless <br>
Expansion _if_ it meant 'pave it over', if it meant assuming <br>
everything in the cosmos was simply raw materials to be converted to <br>
our own mechanisms.  I don't think this attitude was ever implied by <br>
the Principles themselves, but could be derived from some other <br>
sources.  Anyway, if someone saw this ('pave it over') as an <br>
Extropians attitude and didn't like it, Boundless Improvement might <br>
still be interpreted as 'remake everything in our own image'.<br>
<p>
If you want "extropianism for moderates" then maybe the term to use <br>
here is Boundless Exploration. Exploration *might* not have the <br>
imperialistic connotations of the other two terms; also, it preserves <br>
the acronym :-)<br>
