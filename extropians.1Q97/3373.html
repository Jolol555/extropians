<i>&gt;From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;</i><br>
..<br>
<i>&gt;Given the existence of Ti on the moon, I'd go for a TitanAl/Carbon</i><br>
<i>&gt;matrix.</i><br>
<p>
David Cary:<br>
A metal/carbon composite. Interesting. We would have to worry about <br>
unequal<br>
thermal expansion and a few other things ...<br>
<p>
I'm still amazed that a rope of "Buckyfiber" can hold over 100 times as<br>
much weight as the same size rope made of Ti (500 times as much weight <br>
as a<br>
steel cable). (Bishop got this number off the web, so it must be true <br>
:-).<br>
<p>
[[Actually, I've heard the ‘two to three times diamond’s tensile’<br>
 from several sources. For a little more on Al/Ti/C<br>
composites check out Tom McKendree's paper at the <br>
Molecular Manufacturing Shortcut Group (MMSG) chapter of the<br>
National Space Society. It is much easier to get the materials from an <br>
asteroid. In<br>
"The Interworld Rapid Transit System" is a proposal to shoot raw <br>
materials <br>
from various asteroids to the construction site. This paper will be in <br>
*The Journal of the British Interplanetary Society*.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The question is what the elasticity of the matrix it is cured</i><br>
<i>&gt;into is.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the properties of small fibers don't help any; it's the bulk <br>
material<br>
properties that are important in this application.<br>
<p>
Lorrey's comment has caused me to wonder how much these "Buckyfiber" <br>
cables<br>
will stretch when we start spinning the station. (Note that the answer <br>
to<br>
this question requires measuring the "modulus of elasticity", a <br>
completely<br>
different material property than and yet confusingly similar-sounding <br>
to<br>
Elastic Strength).<br>
<p>
[[Young's Modulus (modulus of elasticity) for Buckyfiber is probably <br>
similar to Carbon Fiber- on the order<br>
of  100 Gpa (a total guess). One more sweet thing about Carbon Fiber is <br>
the extremely <br>
low coefficient of thermal expansion-- for some flavors it is even <br>
slightly negative (translation:<br>
the fiber doesn't expand in length when it is heated, it can even <br>
contract). Composite material<br>
engineers use a blend of fibers and matrix to create parts that don't <br>
change their shape when <br>
they are heated up. This property might also carry over to Buckyfiber.<br>
Once the thing is spun up, slagged and pressurized, these expansion <br>
effects retreat <br>
to the second or third order.]]<br>
<p>
Bishop makes the almost prescient guess that<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;fiber should be wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees</i><br>
<p>
Cary comments that<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I think that 1980's technology "graphite-fiber" pressure cylinders </i><br>
use the<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; optimum 26.6 degrees.</i><br>
<p>
[[Yes, for cylinders under uniform hydrostatic load.]]<br>
<p>
Or maybe lots of ropes or "sheets" connecting the axis to several <br>
lateral<br>
lines running the length of the cylinder. The slight extra curvature (I<br>
have to climb to the top of the mountain to reach the rope anchor) <br>
would<br>
improve the safety factor.<br>
<p>
[[A catenary-ish cross-section for the cylinder would be nice, although <br>
<p>
harder to make. The presumption was the circumferential tensile <br>
strength<br>
is great enough to remove this requirement. ]]<br>
<p>
If you merely inflate a really large sphere, so large that it just <br>
starts<br>
to touch the tops of the atmosphere on both sides, will the <br>
differential<br>
gas pressures automatically push sphere back toward axis if it ever <br>
gets<br>
misaligned ?<br>
(The tiny amounts of gas leaking out the ends of the cylinder would <br>
tend to<br>
push the sphere along the axis *away* from the exact center of the <br>
cylinder<br>
..)<br>
<p>
[[I looked at the idea of a thin membrane at the top of the atmosphere, <br>
but didn't consider<br>
an inflated version. A problem with transparent membranes is radiation <br>
and<br>
dust degradation. A nanotech membrane _might_ be able to self -repair <br>
and still<br>
have acceptable transparency.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nope, build it edge on to the sun, with no transparent sectors. the </i><br>
ring<br>
<i>&gt;shields itself from radiation, and the edge of the rim will have </i><br>
fresnel<br>
<i>&gt;lenses on both sides to focus light inward to the opposite edge.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting. With a very "short" cylinder (almost looks like a toroid)<br>
(length &lt;&lt; radius), one could build a large (curved) mirror collecting <br>
all<br>
the light from full end-on area facing the sun (pi*r^2), and focus it <br>
down<br>
to the much smaller farmland area (2*pi*r*length), to get the full<br>
Earth-standard amount of sunlight at distances much further away from <br>
Sol<br>
than Earth.<br>
<p>
[[I think Lorrey means 'the axis of rotation collinear with the orbital <br>
axis'.<br>
Do note the period of the 1000 Km, one gravity design is .558 hour <br>
(33.5 <br>
minutes).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the rim can easily carry a large enough current</i><br>
<i>&gt;to generate a good sized magnetic field. With the sun edge onto the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ring, thermocouple electric effects will be a big contributor to this.</i><br>
<p>
Hm. Interesting feature.<br>
<p>
[[Hm. I like it!]]<br>

<i>&gt;A loose strand on the outer surface of that rotating cylinder ... </i><br>
would<br>
<i>&gt;unwind, getting longer and more dangerous by the second.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[Another reason to build two cylinders side-by-side.</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand this.<br>
<p>
I originally thought you meant side-by-side like this:<br>
<p>
<p>
    spinward<br>
        ^<br>
  N====S  S====N<br>
                        v<br>
                  spinward<br>
<p>
but that loose fiber would still be almost as dangerous if they were<br>
side-by-side like this:<br>
    spinward<br>
         ^<br>
  N====S<br>
<p>
  S====N<br>
        v<br>
    spinward<br>
<p>
[[I meant the second version. <br>
This reminds me of the story of<br>
the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO), a space telescope launched <br>
in<br>
 the late '60's. This (very expensive) package was spin-stabilized for <br>
launch. When it<br>
was in orbit, a small weight on a string wrapped around the body of the <br>
satellite <br>
was supposed to be released, like a yo-yo. As it unwound, it carried <br>
off the angular momentum and <br>
slowed down the spin rate. Well, a little problem came up when the <br>
apogee motor<br>
burned out. While its empty shell was still attached to the end of the <br>
satellite, the<br>
configuration was unstable about the long axis, and so the thing went <br>
into a "flat spin".<br>
So now ground control had a little dilemma: they knew that when they <br>
released the apogee<br>
motor that the satellite would flip back onto the right spin axis, but <br>
there was a 50-50 chance<br>
of it spinning the wrong way, meaning the yo-yo wouldn't work. Well, <br>
Murphy stepped<br>
up to the plate, and last I heard the observatory is still up there, <br>
spinning away. If they<br>
had installed a second yo-yo wound the other way this would have been <br>
covered, but <br>
all the spare yo-yos were left on the ground.]]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Obviously if the ends are vented to space, the axis is in a vacuum --</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I</i><br>
<i>&gt;keep thinking that if we sealed up the ends (or the tube was very</i><br>
<i>&gt;long), we</i><br>
<i>&gt;would have (significant) atmosphere at the axis. Perhaps my intuition</i><br>
<i>&gt;is</i><br>
<i>&gt;leading me astray.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[What would keep it there?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Assuming the ends are sealed, what would pull atmosphere at the axis <br>
away<br>
from the axis ? I see that Earth's gravity pulls atmosphere at high<br>
altitudes down towards the surface, (the force due to gravity varies by<br>
less than a factor of 2 from the surface clear out to the typical Space<br>
Shuttle orbit), but there is no such force near the cylinder's axis, <br>
right?<br>
<p>
[[No, not a force per se. But consider a particle in the space around <br>
the axis (this<br>
is vaguely similar to the Ringworld stability problem). Any non-zero <br>
velocity <br>
component will send it back to the walls or ends of the cylinder. This <br>
will be<br>
the case for gas-kinetic models. For continuum models, the force is <br>
'centrifugal'<br>
transferred via viscosity.<br>
<p>
<p>
BTW, the Buckyfiber Open Air Habitat is an original proposal of mine, <br>
and first <br>
aired on the Extro and &gt;H lists.<br>
