&lt;But since no existing system of government "functions", and no system <br>

we have no recourse but reason from axiomatic values to determine a <br>
system that best fits them, and work toward that. When we have that <br>
working, and we can see its flaws that we might not have anticipated, <br>
we can fix them as well.&gt;<br>

I know you said your role in this debate was to be the extremist, to <br>
push the envelope, so maybe somebody also needs to play 'conservative' <br>
- it seems to me that "utter contempt" might be more destructive than <br>
constructive. I have no doubt that anarcho-capitalist approaches would <br>
be better than what we have now; but, are we really ready to call in <br>
the disassemblers and reconstruct everything from the ground up, <br>
according to whose "axiomatic values"? I'm afraid there's a 'small' <br>
problem of several billion people controlling innumerable existing <br>
resources and assets, who feel the current system is "functioning" <br>
quite well, and who might easily misinterpret your stance for tossing <br>
everything overboard, all at once, into Jim Legg's free-for-all <br>
"soup".<br>
