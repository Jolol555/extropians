Bloody hell to learn, though.  Thing is, language for humans (and most<br>
transhumans; I think you have to make rather drastic changes to avoid<br>
this) is foremost spoken communication.  Or gestural, for the deaf; the<br>
relative ease of deaf children learning sign language vs. normal people<br>
and spoken language is something I should read up on, I suppose.<br>
Writing comes second.  It therefore makes it easier to learn the writing<br>
system if it corresponds well to the spoken language.  Younger writing<br>
systems -- esperanto, Finnish, Malaysian -- correspond very well.<br>
English not so well, although part of that is enocoding historical<br>
information -- 'ph' for /f/ means Greek -- and I've read an essay<br>
arguing that English orthography is actually very good given the number<br>
of dialects; a set of letters does not always have the same sound, but<br>
it tends to have the same sound in one dialect, and another sound<br>
_consistently_ in another dialect.<br>
<p>
At any rate, Chinese ideograms have no relation to phonology.  If all<br>
languages were just different codes for a common set of concepts, this<br>
wouldn't be a problem.  People could speak whatever they wanted, and use<br>
one common set of ideograms.  Brin's Galactic languages possibly best<br>
work that way.  But this isn't the case for us.<br>
<p>

<p>
Erm.  Objective data certainly exists.  Mathematics works fine for this.<br>
I'm not so sure about objective concepts; narrowly speaking, they'd<br>
probably be handled by maths; as you get broader in scope more<br>
subjective context gets swept in.  Even a straightforward fact like<br>
'father' can encode a lot of cultural information.  Certainly one could<br>
specify a set of scientific concepts common to all humans, but I'm not<br>
sure it would be worth devoting a new language to them.  Some might<br>
argue that much scientific discourse is already another language, or<br>
several, even if it condescends to use the English grammar.<br>

<p>
Hah.  I've never heard of Rudee Valee.  Is phonology really stabilizing?<br>
I'd think that's best measured, not stated from personal perception.<br>
Arguably linguistic change should speed up, because of more and more<br>
exposure to other tongues.  Wait for Spanish and Chinese to have major<br>
impacts on world language by 2130.  The Internet allows speakers of odd<br>
languages to find each other around the world -- I think there are<br>
Esperanto newsgroups.  Certainly many Esperanto postings on sci.lang.<br>

Add more pronouns; add more prounouns or more words, or pay more<br>
attention to linguistic history and etymology; how is English not<br>
adaptable?[1]; English-ISV[1] doesn't suffer from cultural dependencies,<br>
does it?<br>
<p>
[1] One benefit of non-inflection is the ease with which we can turn<br>
nouns into verbs and whatnot.  Actually Indo-European had this as well<br>
despite its heavy inflection, if my source is correct; concepts were<br>
roots, which then took suffixes to indicate (type of!) noun or verb,<br>
plus all the nitty details German and Greek remind us of.[3]<br>
<p>

<p>
[3] The article (back of the American Heritage Dictionary) said that<br>
English had lost almost all original inflection, but traces of the<br>
primeval syntax could be seen in Ancient Greek, for example.  Greek<br>
makes Latin syntax look fairly simple, despite having one less case.  I<br>
hope the author was speaking in hyperbole then.  Given the subsequent<br>
hints of Indo-European grammar, I fear he may not have been.<br>
