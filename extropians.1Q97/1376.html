<i>&gt; It is surely a cautionary tale of the human propensity for "group think", </i><br>
<i>&gt; something which John Gribbin goes on to address by paraphrasing </i><br>
<i>&gt; David Mermin's 1993 article from the 'Reviews of Modern Physics #65 </i><br>
<i>&gt; (1993) page 803:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Writing in 1993, David Mermin referred to the generations of graduate </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; students who might have been tempted to construct hidden-variables</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; theories but had been 'beaten into submission' by the claim that von</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Neumann had proved that it could not be done.  He said that von </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Neumann's 'no-hidden-variables proof' was based on an assumption so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; silly 'that one is led to wonder whether the proof was ever studied</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; by either the students or those who appealed to it to rescue them</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;	from speculative adventures' in the realms of quantum interpretation. </i><br>
<p>
This whole discussion has been very enlightening to me.  It's news <br>
to me that von Neumann was wrong.  I must confess that I, like most <br>
people, have always accepted his assertion about hidden variables <br>
without looking at the proof.  Not only that -- I still haven't read the <br>
proof.  Now I'm taking your word for it that he was wrong!!   ;-)  <br>
<p>
Going beyond group-think is almost impossible.  But we have to keep <br>
trying.  <br>
<p>
BTW, "Grete Hermann" sounds like a female name.  If so, let's give <br>
credit where credit is due.  <br>
