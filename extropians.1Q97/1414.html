Hi John,<br>
<p>
Digging deeper into this can of worms, let's see what I can come up with.<br>
I may strike at some deeply held beliefs, but when I talk about any of this<br>
stuff, it's not anything personal so much as a peek into the subtleties of<br>
the human memetic process.<br>
<p>
1. FREE WILL, AND ITS INVERSE DEFINTION:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;John:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think the question of determinism has much to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;free will. He [Turing] proved that no computer program (and I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;that's what we are) can predict what it will do next, that is, if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;will ever stop. The easiest, indeed the only way to know what a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;computer program will do is to run it and see, we figure out what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;are going to do when we actually do it. This would be true</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;regardless of whether the Universe is deterministic or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Omega:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is misleading in the extreme. Free will has everything to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;with the absense of determinism</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why? Everything, absolutely everything, happens because of cause and effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; OR it does not happen because of cause and effect, and if it does not then</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is by definition random. From your last post I thought we agreed on this.</i><br>
<p>
Random can either be defined broadly as that which lacks specific pattern,<br>
or narrowly (as you do immediately above) as that which happens without <br>
cause.  The problem is that many things (as in a digital slot machine) can<br>
be random (in the broad sense) because of Turing non-predictability, while<br>
yet being totally deterministic.<br>
<p>
The classic definition (in my own words) of free will in philosophy, theology<br>
(ackh), and culture at large, is:  <br>
<p>
   The ability to select or to not select an action (or to select a specific<br>
   action from amongst a set of more than one) free from constraints imposed<br>
   by external circumstances, or by other agencies (such as divine will) that<br>
   might impose additional constraints not found in the external circumstances.  <br>
<p>
In this classic meaning, free will was possessed by someone, within some <br>
scope, when the the possessor of such was considered to be a sufficiently<br>
unconstrained causal agent that he has the freedom of choice as defined above<br>
within that scope.  Or in simpler terms, one has free will if they are an <br>
acausal agent within some realm (regardless of whether any such acausality <br>
actually exists because one might, in fact, lack free will as so defined).<br>
<p>
The rise of deterministic science (a la Newton) showed us (because of our <br>
rising knowledge of internal constraint) that free will in the classic mean-<br>
ing either does not exist, or for those more cautious, is of much less sig-<br>
nificance in our lives than we previously imagined.  Philosophically, the<br>
hidden determinism of genes, hormones, etc. was not considered to be free <br>
will, but was considered to be merely another constraint upon one's free <br>
will.  In this regard, a system (be it a digital slot machine, or a human<br>
being) was considered to lack free will if it was entirely deterministic,<br>
even if the actions were unpredictable because the determinism operated from<br>
an unknowable depth of detail/complexity.<br>
<p>
Since science, by definition, does not deal with the unknowable (except for<br>
defining the boundaries of such) the scientific appraisal of free will is<br>
limited to refuting its presence wherever predictibility can be found.  This<br>
leads to an operative principle which places knowable limits on where free <br>
will may be found as defined in its classical sense:<br>
<p>
*  Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist.<br>
<p>
I agree that your definition is clear and precise (at least in meaning):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I gave you my definition, it's precise and as good as any I've seen, I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; give it again: A being has free will if and only if it can not predict what</i><br>
<i>&gt; it will do next.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately your definition is the logical negative of the classic<br>
definition because when stripped of the self-reference (which I will get<br>
to shortly) it reduces to an operative principle which says:<br>
<p>
?  Where something is not predictable, then free will does exist.<br>
<p>
It is a well established fact in formal logic that the negative of a logical<br>
statement has a different meaning from the original, and furthermore derives<br>
no support as to its validity from the original statement.  It may turn out<br>
to be true anyway, but it's not in anyway guaranteed.  This redefinition <br>
thus leads a couple of problems:<br>
<p>
1. The first is that it changes the the established meaning of a term which<br>
   goes back millenia in human culture.  For this reason philosophy and<br>
   theology both reject it, and to proceed with such a redefinition is to <br>
   invite nothing but a communication gap with other parts of society.<br>
   <br>
2. Free will is a dicey subject in any case, but at least with the original<br>
   definition, we can rest assured that almost no viewpoint based upon that<br>
   definition has not been examined in minute detail by millenia of rabbis,<br>
   philosophers, and theologians more times, and to greater detail, than we<br>
   can possibly imagine.<br>
<p>
   Redefined, every viewpoint based upon it amounts to nothing but an <br>
   arbitrary claim that needs to be proven and defended from every angle<br>
   because the redefinition asserts as true something widely accepted (by<br>
   formal logic) as not being derivable from the original definition.<br>
<p>
2. DEEPER PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW DEFINTION:<br>
<p>
Beyond the fact that the second definition changes the meaning, there are ac-<br>
tually deeper problems with this definition which our own dialog illustrates:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think there's a big jump when going from 'feeling that we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; free will' to 'actually having free will'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not a big jump at all, not even a hop if you use my definition, and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; the only one I have ever found useful.</i><br>
<p>
I could say that since your definition equates feeling with actuality that<br>
it is solipsistic, but this would be ridiculous since even a fully determin-<br>
istic system could be guilty of solipsism by this line of thought.  The <br>
problem is that as precise as the negative definition is in meaning, it is<br>
not precise in practice; because by failing to refer to any global reality,<br>
it does not provide a basis for describing any form of global truth.<br>
<p>
By this definition you could have the "free will" to use your keys to enter<br>
a building, when in fact, you have no such free will because your landlord<br>
just changed all the locks.  Likewise there could be millions of things you<br>
feel you are free to do, but in fact can not do because your thougths lack<br>
the biochemical keys necessary for initiating or completing those actions. <br>
I hardly need to mention that the "actuality" of free will that I'm talking<br>
about would (according to your above commentary) change strictly as a result<br>
of changes in one's knowledge regarding self and/or environment.  Now I <br>
wouldn't go so far as to say that positivism is entirely without merit, but<br>
when it leads to local definitions of truth, or worse yet solipsism, I <br>
believe that it has exceeded its realm of validity.<br>
<p>
So far as I can see, once we strip out all references to local truth in this<br>
new definition of free will, we are back to one of two possibilities:<br>
<p>
a. Either free will does not exist at all, in which case this new definition<br>
   is wholly wrong because nothing that it called free will, was in fact such.<br>
<p>
b. Or, through some form of trancendent acausality in keeping with the first<br>
   meaning, some limited form of free will does exist, in which case this<br>
   new definition of free will is an immensely imprecise way of telling<br>
   us where such free will is found.<br>
<p>
And now that quantum physics has clearly been shown to be unable to tell us<br>
whether our reality is even a deterministic one or not, the whole subject is<br>
right back in the realm of philosophy/theology/metaphysics.<br>
<p>
3. CHAOTIC RED HERRING:<br>
<p>
This uncertainty as to the "actual" nature of things still does not excuse <br>
the fact that dogmatic orthodox science in the inter-related fields of <br>
computer science, AI theory, chaos and complexity theory, and cognitive<br>
theory have created a monumental red herring by taking the logically <br>
unsupported negative of the traditional definition of free will and <br>
popularizing it as the scientific wisdom of the day.<br>
<p>
To say that we might have some form of free will within what might well be<br>
a totally deterministic reality is an insult to anyone's intelligence; yet<br>
this is what complexity based free-will theory tries to tell us is possible.<br>
<p>
That thought and knowledge do not determine ontos, was the realization that <br>
led to the repudiation of scholasticism and the foundation of modern science.<br>
But now, in this burst of negative logic, modern scientific dogma makes <br>
the leap to tell us that the mere absense of knowledge that surrounds a <br>
complex/chaotic process is sufficient to account for the ontos of both <br>
consciousness and free will, what poppycock.<br>
<p>
Consciousness and free will may or may not exist in actuality, but if we <br>
can't frame the discussion in terms of causal (or acausal) principles, leading<br>
to predictive successes (or failures) with regard to global truth, I fail to<br>
see how our analysis will amount to anything but a return to a mutant form <br>
of scholasticism.  Given the well understood fact that the truth of negative<br>
logic is indefinite, these modern claims should all be subject to a very<br>
definite burden of proof.  Without proof, we have what amounts to nothing<br>
more than someone's opinion again filling the role of handed down truth.<br>
<p>
I can not help but wonder if the quantum mysticism of the orthodox Copenhagen<br>
interpretation of quantum physics has played a role in this.  True, AI theory<br>
is a long ways away from QM, but orthodox Copenhagen QM played a very key role<br>
in making acceptable again the idea that mere knowledge can determine ontos.<br>
<p>
4. GROUP THINK:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This gratutituous redefinition of "free will" to mean Turing non-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; predictability in the AI, extropian, and scientific community is, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; general, a strong testament to the pervasiveness of "group think"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I've found that nearly everybody I meet on the street has exactly the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same opinions I do.</i><br>
<p>
This is not at all my experience.  Whether talking or reading, the only place<br>
I see definitions based upon Turing non-predictability is in the orthodox <br>
scientific community, especially in the inter-related fields of computer <br>
science, AI theory, chaos and complexity theory, and cognitive theory.<br>
<p>
As far as the people you "meet on the street", I wonder how many of them are <br>
even aware of the subtle (but very significant) distinction between:<br>
<p>
a. Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist. -VS-<br>
b. Where something is not predictable, then free will does exist.  ??<br>
<p>
Or if they've been educated (pressured) into belief (b) by professors?  Or<br>
if they've just absorbed that meme because of all the hype behind it in some <br>
circles in our culture?  If this is truly your experience that most people <br>
you meet believe in statement (b) as opposed to statement (a) then the depth<br>
of the communication gap within our culture on these very fundamental issues<br>
is far greater than the already large gap that I perceived.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;or "political correctness"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also true, as any long term member of this list will tell you, I've never</i><br>
<i>&gt; made a politically controversial statement in my life.</i><br>
<p>
Even something as apparently innocuous as choosing statement (b) as opposed<br>
to statement (a) (or vice versa) has the potential to be a politically con-<br>
troversial statement right off the bat.  My reference to political correct-<br>
ness on this issue is not in any way a personal indictment, so much as what<br>
I believe to be a perfect example of how we are completely immersed in it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The redefinition of words to new meanings is right up there with</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the Marxist rewriting of history.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the Communist Party.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't think so, but the Communist Party (along with leftism and rightism)<br>
are all perfect testaments to the treacherous waters of group think.  It was<br>
only about a decade ago that a huge stock brokerage firm was caught running<br>
a multi-million dollar check kiting scheme.  Why?  Because the entire board<br>
of directors had all convinced themselves that they were doing nothing wrong.<br>
<p>
If extropians want to be at the forefront of "some extropian transition", we<br>
might consider what is necessary to disengage us from the natural human tend-<br>
ency to form closed thought systems so that we can somehow avoid repeating<br>
history.  We talk alot about ending death, but it seems to me that the immor-<br>
tality of a social system is best achieved by avoiding the memetic closure <br>
that IMO inevitably leads to senescence, and then death one way or another.<br>
<p>
How can we even think we're going to conquer personal death until we first<br>
conquer the death of social systems.  This is another issue for another day,<br>
but I don't see any way that we are going to conquer any form of death, until<br>
we first conquer memetic closure.  Good luck to one and all, I'm with you on <br>
this, but wondering how much we really know of ourselves.<br>
