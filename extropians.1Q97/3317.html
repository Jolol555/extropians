Ah, this is a fun subject. The ultimate form of terrorism, as somebody on <br>
the Omega Point Theory List put it. <br>
<p>
My favorite way of destroying the universe is the Tumult (as Gregory <br>
Benford called the concept): if our kind of vacuum isn't the "true" <br>
vacuum but a metastabla state, it might be possible to somehow make it <br>
decay into true vacuum. This would start a catalytic process, as the true <br>
vacuum would spread at lightspeed and cause the release of immense <br>
amounts of energy. In the true vacuum our particle states would no longer <br>
be stable, and other particles would be stable i.e. total destruction of <br>
the Universe As We Know It. <br>
<p>
Another fun idea was presented in Peter Nilssons excellent novels<br>
_Rymdvaktaren_ and _Nyaga_ (unfortunately only in Swedesh AFAIK). In his<br>
quite elaborate cosmology (essentially, universes are partially built by<br>
the knowledge from previous universes by jupiter brain-like beings<br>
preserving all information) it might be possible to hack the laws of<br>
nature - by introducing the right information into the universe you could<br>
sabotage it, making it unravel completely. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anwyays, is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; feasible to have an army of destructors destroy the universe, and create</i><br>
<i>&gt; a singularity(by having the mass concentrated so densely) similar to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; one in the origin of the big bang?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I could imagine something like a spreading army of von Neumann<br>
machines that build copies of themselves and launch them, then build<br>
megastructures around stars to control them, and start to move the stars<br>
around to cause a Big Crunch-like effect (might be used to close off a<br>
portion of the universe for an Omega Point if the universe is flat or<br>
open?). It will take a lot of time, of course. <br>
