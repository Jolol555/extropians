From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; After sleeping on it, doing some intentional dreamCAD, I decided that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; yes the cars, in an absolute sense are following a Hohmann elliptical</i><br>
<i>&gt; orbit. However relative to the geosynch and ground stations, since we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are dealing with the earth rotating, they will apear to follow a figure</i><br>
<i>&gt; eight path, with the crossover point being that point at which the cars</i><br>
<i>&gt; angular velocity is equal to the rotation of the earth. So, this will</i><br>
<i>&gt; require good timing in geosynch traffic control to prevent car</i><br>
<i>&gt; collisions in a high capacity Lorrey Loop.</i><br>
<p>
(-: That's an interesting design technique :-)<br>
<p>
I don't think ballistic cars will literally follow a figure eight<br>
trajectory in the earth's rotational frame of reference, although you<br>
are right that the orbit will have a loop in it.  Rather, it will be more<br>
like a Spirograph pattern, because the orbit will not form a closed loop<br>
when it comes back to Earth.  It will be in a different place because<br>
the Earth has rotated away.  So left to itself the car would continue<br>
back on up, loop again, and come back down, repeatedly.<br>
<p>
If the period of the elliptical orbit had some simple relationship to<br>
the 24-hour rotational period of the Earth, then eventually the ground<br>
station would catch up with the cars again.  But it won't happen on<br>
the first orbit.  This suggests that your "ground station" maybe would<br>
be better placed in low earth orbit, otherwise you'll have a lot of<br>
fireballs streaking through the equatorial skies all over the planet.<br>
<p>
Another idea would be to put your high station not in geosynch orbit,<br>
but at whatever altitude gives the Hohmann elliptical trajectory exactly<br>
a 24 hour period.  This way the cars all come back to the ground station,<br>
and you do have your nice figure eight relative to the rotating earth.<br>
<p>
The only problem is that the high station's orbit would not be geosynch.<br>
You could have several high stations and time your launches so that one<br>
would be overhead when the cars get there, or you could have the high<br>
station be in a non-inertial orbit, actively thrusting to stay geosynch.<br>
Maybe the thrust requirements would be small enough to be satisfied<br>
by mirrors.<br>
