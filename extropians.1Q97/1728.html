Eliezer,<br>
<p>
A few quick comments, although I like the way you summarized the issue. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 1)  Everything we say about "free will" is an artifact of the way we</i><br>
<i>&gt; view causality.  Because people were talking about free will long before</i><br>
<i>&gt; they knew anything about physics.</i><br>
<p>
I agree totally.  People have been pondering this for millenia, and<br>
most certainly the way we view this is an artifact of our viewpoint<br>
and/or our understanding.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  Causality, in human intuition, is counterfactual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   When we say "A caused B", we mean that, if A were not present, B would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not have been present, and that in order to get B one should do A.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (This is a cognitive, not an ontological, statement about "causality".)</i><br>
<p>
The only fly in the ointment is whether reality, in fact, always obeys <br>
this form of counterfactuality as we understand it (something very much<br>
in doubt).  If it doesn't always do so, then it would see that our cog-<br>
nitive understanding of this may be in for an adjustment to say the least.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 3)  "Determinism" conflicts with "free will".</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "If reality is deterministic, than instead of your thoughts</i><br>
<i>&gt; determining your actions, your actions are predetermined; therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever you do isn't your fault."</i><br>
<p>
This would be an accurate statement of what the ontology of a <br>
deterministic reality would be like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4)  Determinism does not conflict with free will.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   If your thoughts were not present, you would not have committed your</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions.  Therefore your thoughts do cause your actions; *you* cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; your actions; and there is no moral problem with blaming you for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions.  </i><br>
<p>
Of course, if reality is deterministic, then our thoughts would be <br>
predetermined too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no distinction between deterministic you and</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterministic reality; even if reality is deterministic, you are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; the source of what happens and what you do makes a difference.  QED(*).</i><br>
<p>
Totally true, but unfortunately, the phase leading up to the QED amounts<br>
to nothing more than a tautology (as its application to a deterministic <br>
reality makes obvious).  The problem with defining our language around<br>
tautologies or cognitive fads is that it can easily block insight into<br>
ontological issues that might be more readily apparent if we at least <br>
tried to define our language ontologically.  <br>
<p>
To me it seems very obvious that the structure of our language determines<br>
our ability to appreciate and comprehend the myriad aspects of ontological<br>
reality.  I see no reason to gum up the works with tautologies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Right?  Doesn't this cognitive analysis dovetail exactly with our</i><br>
<i>&gt; intuitions on the subject?  Our intuitive model of determinism</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflicting with free will goes like this:  If the outcome is prewritten</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Book of God, than what we do must "match" that outcome and isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; our fault.  In other words, our thoughts are coerced to match the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prewritten outcome, and the prewritten outcome is the causal source of</i><br>
<i>&gt; our misdeeds.  As if the outcome of your decision were *explicitly*</i><br>
<i>&gt; written in your brain, and your thoughts tuned to match.  Were this the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case, the explicitly prewritten outcome would indeed be the source of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your misdeeds and you couldn't be blamed for them.</i><br>
<p>
Well stated. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; This model of deterministic reality is incorrect; what we will do is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; explicitly written within our brains.  We, ourselves, still reach the</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision of our own free will.  That which produces the outcome is</i><br>
<i>&gt; identical with our thoughts and ourselves; hence free will.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, it doesn't have to be written in our brains so much as in the<br>
totality of reality itself.  The interface between our brains and reality<br>
at large is quite open.  In fact the nature of the interface itself is a<br>
very open issue cognitively, this is why I keep harping about the modern<br>
definitions of free will and consciousness that reduce to tautologies.<br>
<p>
NOTE: I'm not in anyway disputing the moral issues that are involved here,<br>
      but we have to realize is that refusing to look at the determinstic<br>
      components of reality as we discover them because of our moral <br>
      distaste is to engage in the creation of religious dogma.<br>
<p>
      Just like the deterministic principles of Netwonian and Darwinain<br>
      science led to immense conflicts with the older religions and the<br>
      creation of such dubious concepts as Cartesian dualism to try and<br>
      paper over the conflicts, so too are the new deterministic prin-<br>
      ciples of advanced-action bringing history around to repeat itself<br>
      by creating conflicts with the newer religions of strong AI theory<br>
      and quantum mysticism that are so prevalent today. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Epigrammatic snap summary:</i><br>
<i>&gt; The outcome may be pre-written in our brains, but WE are the writing.</i><br>
<p>
Very true, but who is the writer, and what does the writing say?!  Very<br>
old questions to say the least.<br>
