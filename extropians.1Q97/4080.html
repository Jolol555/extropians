Cryonics is _very_ important, and should be definitely explored. In fact I <br>
cannot take a person seriously who is adamant on not to (permanently) <br>
die, and yet still has not signed up with a cryonics outfit of his choice.<br>
(Thus I cannot consider my current commitment level to be adequate, yet).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but it should not distract from our true goals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We want metamorphosis not stasis.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, as far I can see, the road to Eden still leads straight through the<br>
dewar. This is messy, unaesthetical, but also, unavoidable. Should you <br>
get an incurable disease, or be run over by a car tomorrow, no dietary <br>
suplements, CR, or even t'ai chi are going to save you. Investing in a <br>
signup is a cost-benefit calculation, the costs being known (life <br>
(perfectly adequate term, this) insurace), yet the benefits currently <br>
uncalculable.<br>
<p>
It's a gamble. So far, recent science results say chances of winning are <br>
growing constantly. We might live to see cryonics to become mainstream <br>
(gasp!). If a mass movement, suspension costs would go down to a few <br>
thousands dollars, less than a conventional interrment/cremation. (Sure, <br>
it has been predicted for past 20 years).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I confidently say few of us want to specificly become a frozen mom/popsicle </i><br>
<i>&gt; for the rest of eternity.</i><br>
<p>
Speak for yourself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We would be intact, alas slightly dead is still too dead.</i><br>
<p>
Try finding that point in persona space from atmosperic carbon dioxide <br>
molecules that once contributed to you-pattern. What is better: conserve <br>
the fabric, even if slightly frayed around the edges due to radical <br>
conservation artefacts, or unravel it completely, and cut up the treads? <br>
That fabric might be not a work of art, quite dull, very similiar to many <br>
other ones. Yet I happen to feel a sentimental attachment to it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We want to evolve into a dynamic state more able to acheive our dreams.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Cryonics only allows more time to wait for technology to develop</i><br>
<p>
"only"?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; that will suit our needs for repair/augmentation </i><br>
<i>&gt; and will eventually not be needed.</i><br>
<p>
I am not sure a nanoassembler may operate constructively (=maintain the <br>
system for indefinite time) in a wet/squishy biological tissue. Eroding <br>
plaques and hunting for malignant cells is easy, combatting ubiquitous <br>
radical damage is different.<br>
<p>
Uploading is a tabula rasa, from scratch approach. A mutating bit soup <br>
does not change, its state can be frozen and transimitted into fresh <br>
circuitry, or be repaired by increments, soup claiming new circuitry <br>
patches instantly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Given time it will evolve </i><br>
<i>&gt; into a portable and immediate sort of suspension </i><br>
<i>&gt; which will be used to halt damage( ie. paramedics transporting patients ).</i><br>
<p>
I wish I had your degree of optimism considering future forecasts, and <br>
overcoming of physics-related constraints.<br>
