Transhuman studies?  Kathryn was studing Sociology (I think), I'm<br>
doing economics, other folks here are studying philosophy, computer<br>
science and areospace engineering.  I don't think all these people are<br>
well advised to study in the same department under the same advisors.  <br>
<p>
You'd have better luck creating a list of sympathetic professors who<br>
are interested and able to supervise students with transhuman interests.  <br>
This is how most minority academic communities work.<br>
