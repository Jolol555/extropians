Does it really?  It strikes me as abundant good sense.  The alternative<br>
strikes me as narrow-minded, self-defeating sectarianism.<br>
<p>
If we lived in a world where the only people promoting advanced<br>
technological goals happened to be right-to-life fundamentalist Christians<br>
(not as absurd as it might sound, given the standard historical arguments<br>
linking transcendental goals, scientific practice, restraint now in the<br>
service of attainment later, monotheism, etc), many people would proclaim<br>
the `cowardice' of uncoupling those two components.  <br>
<p>
One (former?) member of this list recently proposed at some length that<br>
rational people were obliged to question the testimony of Nazi Holocaust<br>
victims.  I was appalled, as were several other list contributors who<br>
expressed their dismay.  But I can imagine a situation in which that<br>
disgraceful opinion might just happen to have been shared by most<br>
list-members, and linked to other high technology enthusiasms (as they were<br>
in the case of that person).  If such had  been the case I suppose I would<br>
never have joined the list, but then I'd have lost access to all the useful<br>
information that surges through the postings.  Happily, most extropians<br>
seemed to have been offended by that incident.  Still, it is in principle<br>
imaginable that the consensus might have pilloried any objections as<br>
`cowardice'.<br>
<p>
I've just completed a book on the Singularity that comes from an implied<br>
political stance consistent with favourable attitudes to high tech among<br>
intellectuals in the country where I live, Australia, and the peer group<br>
that formed my attitudes, roughly speaking science fiction fandom<br>
(specifically of the Aussie/Brit variety) and a kind of left anarchism<br>
(perhaps meliorative heterotopic consentive tribalism is more accurate, but<br>
a nasty mouthful).  I am not going to abandon my background assumptions<br>
just because people bully me with accusations of `cowardice', just as I'm<br>
going to hold firm to my favourable opinion of the prospects of Faustian<br>
technology despite the disdain of my largely poststructuralist colleagues.  <br>
<p>
These opinions might get me run out the Extopian list on a rail, which I<br>
think would be a pity, because I have learned a great deal during my stay<br>
here.  But I'm damned if I'm going to salute the sectional doctrines of<br>
those transhumanists who contingently happened to emerge in the nation with<br>
the best access to the Internet.  (Out of courtesy, however, I will<br>
probably continue to avoid intruding my own political opinions into a forum<br>
that is, after all, founded explicitly in a libertarian mode.)<br>
