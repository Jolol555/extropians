<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 The same with academic degrees.  Knowing that someone has a Ph.D. is<br>
 precisely as valuable to me as knowing that they own a cat.  &gt;&gt;<br>

Hmm... Well, yes. Both show a sense of follow through, maturity,<br>

In other words, most people do not need a PhD or a cat , but one can be<br>
enriched by both! <br>
