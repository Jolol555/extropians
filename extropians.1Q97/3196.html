<i>&gt; Revolution (civil war) in Albania, because of a Pyramid system!</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry to bring it up again, but i still feel a little insecure about</i><br>
<i>&gt; finding a fail-safe solution for these specific negative examples of free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market capitalism. </i><br>
<p>
You give no background for this assertion at all, and I don't have<br>
the time to go look up the details of every little civil war in some<br>
corner of the globe.  Besides, even if I did, I'd just get some<br>
reporter's opinion of the war, which is likely to be as biased as<br>
yours.  So please fill in for us what you perceive as the relevant<br>
facts: in what way do you claim the Albanian system is "capitalist",<br>
in what way do you claim it "failed", and what evidence is there <br>
that this failure is a primary cause of its civil war?  Your only<br>
detail here is to describe something as a "Pyramid system", which is<br>
not the least bit capitalist.  Fraud is a crime in a free market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally i don't aspire to become wealthy, as the more i work, the more i</i><br>
<i>&gt; work for the state and the less for myself. I am in the fortunate position,</i><br>
<i>&gt; where i have a part time job, (1 day a week) which pays enough per hour to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get by, and leaves me lots of time for individual development. Don't call</i><br>
<i>&gt; it lazyness, call it rational behaviour in states that have maximum income</i><br>
<i>&gt; tax scales of 60-70%, and where some have understood that time is our most</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable possession. </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone care to comment ?</i><br>
<p>
What you aspire to is none of my business.  Make yourself happy.  But<br>
when you vote into power a government that uses its guns to actively<br>
prevent me from achieving what /I/ aspire to, at no detriment to you,<br>
don't complain when I shoot back.<br>
