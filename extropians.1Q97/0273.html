 WHile initially this would cause all sorts of yoyo/seesaw behaviors as<br>
 people actually got into the practice of passing their own stupid laws<br>
 and having to live with the consequences, but I imagine that people<br>
 would tire of that FAST and start to act a lot more responsibly with<br>
 their reaquired powers.<br>

- good answer, and you made me smile...<br>

WIth this, we would need a system of populating the Supreme court with<br>
the most conservative cantankerous old bastards/bitches determined to<br>
protect our Constitutional rights from our own stupidity. THe more<br>
powerful we make the legislative branch responsive to popular whims, we<br>
need an equally powerful brake in the Judicial to prevent us from<br>
lemmingization.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The last thing I want is mean spirited, cantakerous "bastards" or "bitches",<br>
 telling me what is best for me. I heard that for years with Bush, Reagan and<br>
Dole's campaign...<br>
It is no better than "nice", well meaning, condescending liberals telling me<br>
what is good for me.<br>
<p>
As for this "protecting us " from our own stupidity, isnt that EXACTLY what<br>
Optimalized Indivduals dont want?<br>
Exactly what our government is doing just a little TOO well? <br>
This idea is the very destructive, IMAO<br>
<p>
About the lawyers,. no comment needed.<br>
