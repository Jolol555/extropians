From: "David Musick" &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Tony Csoka asked, "Have you been able to significantly increase you </i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematical ability through mental traing? Also, do you believe there is any </i><br>
<i>&gt; aspect of intelligence that is more difficult to improve than others?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Math is something I really enjoy doing, so I've done a lot of work with that, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and my mathematical abilities are significantly greater than they ever have </i><br>
<i>&gt; been.  The complexity of problems I'm able to solve and the speed with which </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm able to solve them keeps increasing the more I practice my math skills.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; After a while, I start picking up on little tricks and shortcuts and develop </i><br>
<i>&gt; more advanced thinking tools, and problems start seeming a lot easier.  Also, </i><br>
<i>&gt; just doing some problems makes it easier to do similar problems.  </i><br>
<p>
When I was in high school I was on the math team, which meant that we<br>
went to a few math contests held at local universities.  We also took<br>
some nationwide written tests.  I did find that with practice my score<br>
on these tests improved considerably.  I found a book at the library,<br>
"The Contest Problem Book", which had sample tests from previous years.<br>
While the problems did not repeat, often the principles were similar<br>
and the problem solving techniques I practiced helped me a great deal<br>
in the contests.  So I agree with David that practice in specific areas<br>
like this can make a difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I'm working on now, with my math, and this can be applied to lots of </i><br>
<i>&gt; other areas too, is to stop hesitating so much between steps.  I have the </i><br>
<i>&gt; unfortunate habit of interrupting myself when I am working on a problem and </i><br>
<i>&gt; pausing frequently.  I want to train myself to just do the problem straight </i><br>
<i>&gt; through, in one swift, fluid motion.  It is hard for me to break this habit, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but I am getting better, and I am getting faster at solving problems, as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; result.</i><br>
<p>
One simple example of this which we all face is when adding a long column<br>
of numbers.  I find that I tend to say to myself, "7 and 9 is 16, and 5 is<br>
21, and 6 is 27, and 7 is 34, and 8 is 42."  I've read many books on<br>
speedy mental arithmetic and they advise training yourself not to verbalize<br>
so much.  Say, "7, 16, 21, 27, 34, 42."  Keep just your running total<br>
in your head, don't allow yourself to verbalize the "and 5 is" part, just<br>
think 16, see 5, and think 21.  It takes practice and discipline but you<br>
soon find that you can add about twice as fast.<br>
