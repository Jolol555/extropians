&lt;&lt; &gt;<br>
<i> &gt;Rational minds cannot be offended.  "Taking offense" is a symptom of</i><br>
<i> &gt;an intellectual pathology that the value of ideas can be judged by</i><br>
<i> &gt;emotional response instead of reason.  To the extent one can express</i><br>
<i> &gt;an idea in a listener's terms, and relate to him from his point of</i><br>
<i> &gt;view, these are practical methods of communication; but one must never</i><br>
<i> &gt;let such deference to your audience dilute the message itself.</i><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Jeez, everyone's irrational sometimes. Besides being practical, reasonable<br>
 'deference to your audience' is POLITE.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes - and you will certainly do better in a debate if you take that into<br>
account....<br>
Not only that, but a truly rational mind knows that we, ourselves,  are<br>
hardwired for emotion and that there may be occasion when emotion ( wanted or<br>
unwanted0 may have it's input. To pretend one has "risen above" this, is IMO<br>
denial, or it indicates emtion being sublimated. This often allows harmful<br>
"slips" into unreasonable anger, passive aggressive behavior or whatever.<br>
THis does notmean we fly into rages, or make rash emotional leaps..<br>
<p>
This is why refined emotion, i.e.: enhanced reason - enhanced emotional<br>
response ( a balance) can be a much better goal than a rational, non emotive<br>
state.<br>
Emotions are valuable guides in decision making, and if carefuly examined can<br>
help us to make subconscious evalutaions and correctly place our values. <br>
For example:<br>
If you anger me, it is usually not without reason. Reasonably there are<br>
things which one cannot abide. If I recognize that, I can deal with you and<br>
not let it pass by.... If I say " I have no feelings", I may ignore you or<br>
not address it...IMHO Thick skin only hides a tender heart.<br>
<p>
If a balance of thoughtfulness and detachment is sought, then you have to<br>
allow for them, even if your know you cannot be ruled by tehm<br>
