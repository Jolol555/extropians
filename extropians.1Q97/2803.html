no governement at all will still leave other powersturctures struggling for<br>

no, but if everybody tries their best to do so, we will get a situation<br>
that comes as close as possible to it. <br>

We're both arguing situations here neither of us wants to see happening.<br>
Yours exist, mine is hypothetical, which is why i am on your side, for the<br>
moment. Breaking off the state step by step, maybe the only way to see what<br>
happens, before taking such a big risk. <br>

<p>
the system worked for a while...<br>
