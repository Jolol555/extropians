Here's something amusing and appropriate that I found on another list.<br>
<p>
<p>
Date:	Mon, 17 Mar 1997 14:40:08 -1000<br>

<p>
Here's something from a UFO list that I'm on. Enjoy!<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-&gt;  SearchNet's   IUFO   Mailing List</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imagine if you will... the leader of the of the fifth invader force speaking</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the commander in chief... reporting what was found upon visiting the</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet</i><br>
<i>&gt;earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"They're made out of meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Meat?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Meat.  They're made out of meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Meat?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"There's no doubt about it.  We picked several from different parts of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They're completely meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"That's impossible.  What about all those radio signals?  The messages to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;stars."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;signals come from machines."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"So who made the machines?  That's who we want to contact."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"THEY made the machines.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  Meat made the</i><br>
<i>&gt;machines."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"That's ridiculous.  How can meat make a machine?  You're asking me to</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;in sentient meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.  These creatures are the only sentient</i><br>
<i>&gt;race in the sector and they're made out of meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Maybe they're like the Orfolei.  You know, a carbon-based intelligence that</i><br>
<i>&gt;goes through a meat stage."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Nope.  They're born meat and the die meat.  We studied them for several of</i><br>
<i>&gt;their life spans, which didn't take too long.  Do you have any idea the life</i><br>
<i>&gt;span of meat?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Spare me.  Okay, maybe they're only part meat.  You know, like the Weddilei.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Nope.  We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But I told you, we probed them.  They're meat all the way through."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"No brain?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Oh, there is a brain all right.  It's just that the brain is made out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;meat!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"So... what does the thinking?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"You're not understanding me, are you?  The brain does the thinking. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Thinking meat!  You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Yes, thinking meat!  Conscious meat!  Loving meat!  Dreaming meat! The meat</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the whole deal!  Are you getting the picture?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Oh my god.  You're serious then.  They're made out of meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Finally, yes.  They are indeed made out of meat.  And they've been trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"So what does the meat have in mind?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"First it wants to talk to us.  Then I imagine it wants to explore the</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information.  The usual."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"We're supposed to talk to meat?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"That's the idea.  That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyone out there?  Anyone home?' That sort of thing."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"They actually do talk then.  They use words, ideas, concepts?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Oh, yes.  Except they do it with meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I thought you just told me they used radio."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"They do, but what do you think is on the radio?  Meat sounds.  You know how</i><br>
<i>&gt;when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise?  They talk by flapping their</i><br>
<i>&gt;meat</i><br>
<i>&gt;at each other.  They can even sing by squirting air through their meat."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Oh my god. Singing meat.  This is altogether too much.  So what do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;advise?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Officially or unofficially?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Both."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all</i><br>
<i>&gt;sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;favor.  Unofficially, I advice that we erase the records and forget the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I was hoping you would say that."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"It seems harsh, but there is a limit.  Do we really want to make contact</i><br>
<i>&gt;with</i><br>
<i>&gt;meat?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I agree one hundred percent.  What's there to say? 'Hello, meat. How's it</i><br>
<i>&gt;going?'  But will this work?  How many planets are we dealing with here?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Just one.  They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can't live on them.  And being meat, they only travel through C space.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"That's it."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Cruel.  But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat?  And the ones who</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they</i><br>
<i>&gt;won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;remember?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"They'll be considered crackpots if they do.  We went into their heads and</i><br>
<i>&gt;smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"A dream to meat!  How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's</i><br>
<i>&gt;dream."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"And we can mark this sector unoccupied."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
