When I first heard of an impending radio interview with Constance <br>
Buchanan, Assoc. Dean at Harvard Divinity School and founder of the <br>
women's studies' department there, I thought, 'this will be good for <br>
a few laughs'.  Instead, it was a fascinating hour in which Buchanan <br>
made a call for continuing to dismantle the underlying cultural norms <br>
that have been based in religious belief (I half-expected for her to <br>
use the word entropy) and developing new leadership and authority <br>
models based on full public agency for everyone.<br>
<p>
In her book _Choosing to Lead:  Women and the Crisis in American <br>
Values_, she reveals the continuing influence of the Christian <br>
religion on secular society and in particular our cultural norms <br>
regarding who has a cultural authority to speak in public regarding <br>
the way our social interactions will be structured and carried out.<br>
It also contains some interesting critiques on the increasingly <br>
narrow scope of feminism.<br>
<p>
In my notes I stated an application to transhumans/extropians:  <br>
It is clear that merely rejecting religion is not sufficient to free <br>
ourselves from its effects.  What remaining vestiges of this <br>
Judeo-Christian cultural map do we continue to play into in our everyday <br>
lives, and are we willing to accept changes based on eradicting those <br>
vestiges?<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
