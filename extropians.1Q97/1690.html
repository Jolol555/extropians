Hi Reilly,<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Omega wrote 1/27/97: &lt;Actually Cramer's transactional interpretation does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not necessarily imply non-locality so much as the fact that local causal</i><br>
<i>&gt; principles propagate (on themicrocausal level) symmetrically</i><br>
<i>&gt; bidirectionally through time....  [P]hilosopher Huw Price in his book</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Time's Arrow and Archimedes Point' also makes the point that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; temporally symmetrical bidirectional causality on the microcausal level</i><br>
<i>&gt; could also have been anticipated by some of the problems Boltzmann was</i><br>
<i>&gt; having with his work...&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This makes little sense to me.  What makes sense is "the fact that local</i><br>
<i>&gt; causal principles propagate (on the microcausal level) asymmetrically</i><br>
<i>&gt; bidirectionally through time."  There are more propagational degrees of</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom in the future than in the past, not in the energy/space aspect of</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence but in the matter/time aspect.</i><br>
<p>
Actually there are some overlooked symmetries here that would take care<br>
of your question about symmetry and quite probably explain how symmetrical<br>
fundamental equations can produce macroscopic asymmetry (indeed, a long <br>
overlooked issue that has languished ever since Boltzmann gave up on it).<br>
I'll try to get to it tomorrow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Omega: &lt;The big question in my mind, and area of greatest interest, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; what... is going on in macrocausality.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The question is the same one that Plato posed, where does coherency and</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligibility come from?  David Lindley's "Where Does the Weirdness Go?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (1996) and David Wick's "The Infamous Boundary" (1995) both delve into this</i><br>
<i>&gt; crucial question of how we get from the small to the big.</i><br>
<p>
It is one of the most interesting questions around.  While an ultimate<br>
answer may never be found although we may be in the position to make <br>
some long overdue breakthroughs in this area.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Having been on a fruitless trip to the ontological cellar with John C.</i><br>
<i>&gt; before, and finding that I'm in agreement with your first statement, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would like to reiterate that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; a) I have never seen a rational case made for information as an ontological</i><br>
<i>&gt; primitive, the knowing entity always gets dumped;</i><br>
<p>
We are in total agreement here.  Likewise, neither has anyone ever made any<br>
kind of rational case for the knowing entity to be an ontological primitive<br>
either.  That's what's so absurd about modern arguments about consciousness,<br>
AI, and free will: either they try to resurrect Cartesian dualism under the<br>
guise of complexity, or they reduce to tautologies that do nothing but des-<br>
cribe the Godelian incompleteness of a self-referencing entity regarding its<br>
own behavior.<br>
<p>
I've heard of things that could lead to information being an ontological <br>
primitive IF reality is described with complex numbers as opposed to real<br>
numbers.  I find it a compelling idea that could cut through this whole <br>
mess, but I have yet to actually dig up the formal proof of this.  <br>
<p>
A short but interesting argument that this will be a fruitful direction is <br>
the very interesting fact that only a complex number system can be math-<br>
ematically complete.  I feel that this will soon be a very hot subject.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; b) I have never seen a rational case made for the current physics</i><br>
<i>&gt; group-think "paradigm" of Big Bang (creation ex nihilo) to random activity</i><br>
<i>&gt; (QM) to Big Crunch (or Heat Death, take your pick), everything gets dumped.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The current metaphysical presupposition of orthodox physics can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; characterized as: from nothing in the beginning, to nothing in the middle,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to nothing in the end.  (The concept "randomness" has utility within</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematical semantic technology but, of course, has no meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; ontologically.)  Perhaps "group-think" physicists lack imagination as well</i><br>
<i>&gt; as reason.  They certainly don't lack emotions, however, witness the howls</i><br>
<i>&gt; of rage over the SSC being cancelled, they get emotional when Uncle Sam</i><br>
<i>&gt; tells them they can't play in taxpayer-funded sandboxes.</i><br>
<p>
Actually the questions of time-symmetry, complex-number completeness, and <br>
these "deeper questions of reality" are all very tied together.  I'm going<br>
to make a real effort at doing an opening salvo on this tommorrow.<br>
