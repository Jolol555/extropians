I got a pleasant surprise when I opened up my New York Times this Sunday <br>
morning (Feb. 23 1997). This is the headline of the lead story on page 1, <br>
"SCIENTIST REPORTS FIRST CLONING EVER OF ADULT MAMMAL", in slightly smaller <br>
type under that "Researchers Astounded; In Procedure On Sheep Fiction Becomes<br>
True And Dreaded Possibilities Are Raised".<br>
<p>
Dr. Ian Wilmult of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh Scotland has taken one <br>
cell from an adult sheep and made a clone from it. The clone was born last <br>
July and seems normal and healthy, genetic tests have shown it is indeed an  <br>
exact clone of the original. Dr. Wilmult said that the same procedure should <br>
work for any mammal, including humans. I don't know many more details, <br>
the full report will be in the British Journal "Nature" on Thursday.<br>
<p>
Dr. Lee Silver of Princeton University said this came just in time for him to  <br>
revise his new book so it will no longer say that cloning is and will always <br>
be impossible, now he says " It basically means that there are no limits. <br>
It means all of Science Fiction is true. They said it could never be done and<br>
now here it is, done before the year 2000." Naturally self proclaimed medical <br>
"ethicist" are very upset, Lori Andrews said "I can see it going on  <br>
surreptitiously,[...] I can imagine new crimes". I agree with Dr. Ronald  <br>
Munson, "Incredible! The genie is out of the bottle. This technology is not <br>
in principle policeable".                <br>
