        Yes, a few months ago I had an interview with CBC (via phone)<br>
regarding uploading and the extropian view of how future mechanics will help<br>
humanity rather than hinder it.  It appears that extropy *is* beginning to<br>
be its own entity rather than being dubbed as "...a spinoff of objectivism"<br>
or "neo-fascist" as has been the case before.  It is particularly<br>
interesting that CBC itself has taken an interest, considering that it is<br>
the only national network that is the earpiece to the Canadian government.<br>
I look forward to seeing how your segment is received on "Big Life".<br>
