Lets add a little controversy to this list again. (it's been kind of calm<br>
lately ;-) )<br>
<p>
I<br>
Revolution (civil war) in Albania, because of a Pyramid system!<br>
<p>
Do we blame it on the state ?, or could this be an error that somehow<br>
slipped into our free market ideals ? I remember Russia having some similar<br>
problems and social unrest, in a (stock market pyramid) case where it<br>
wasn't supported by the state, a few years ago. <br>
<p>
It's nice to be more free to make a little money, but what's the difference<br>
between the state taking it all away, or angry mobs pillaging your<br>
bussiness every 5, 10, or 20 year interval ? <br>
<p>
Sorry to bring it up again, but i still feel a little insecure about<br>
finding a fail-safe solution for these specific negative examples of free<br>
market capitalism. <br>
<p>
<p>
II<br>
And rational thinking in irrationalized systems:<br>
<p>
Personally i don't aspire to become wealthy, as the more i work, the more i<br>
work for the state and the less for myself. I am in the fortunate position,<br>
where i have a part time job, (1 day a week) which pays enough per hour to<br>
get by, and leaves me lots of time for individual development. Don't call<br>
it lazyness, call it rational behaviour in states that have maximum income<br>
tax scales of 60-70%, and where some have understood that time is our most<br>
valuable possession. <br>
<p>
anyone care to comment ?<br>
