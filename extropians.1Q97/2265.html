<i>&gt;&gt;Jim, either I'm completely thick or you're off your trolley. :-) </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;You are explaining obscurum per obscurius.  What are the 'non-local</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;variables hidden in price', and why should anyone bother with them;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hidden variables are structural. For example, a corporatist hidden</i><br>
<i>&gt;structure, say in television news broadcasting, prevents any employee</i><br>
<i>&gt;from speaking out against corruption and lack of real constructivist</i><br>
<i>&gt;analysis of events by simply replacing the employee (at whatever level).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The kinds of corporate shenanigans you describe *are* reflected in price<br>
; that is in fact one of the subtleties of the price system that<br>
anticapitalists don't understand.  For example, a news corporation such<br>
as you describe is a less effective news corporation than one that<br>
doesn't indulge in such practices.  In a free market, in the long run, it<br>
will therefore fail (because if and when they are being rational,  part<br>
of what people are buying when they buy news is real news).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;what have they got to do with 'intrinsic value'?  Never mind the AI,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;stick to economics for the moment, so that I can get some kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;grasp of what you are talking about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Future planning HAS to take into account AI and the very simple fact that AI</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't going to be making decisions based on hidden structures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Constructionist AI will look under every rock for every variable. The sooner</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is realized that AI controllers won't be wanting to place bets based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;price, the better.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think I'm beginning to understand what you're on about.  Ian Banks' Culture<br>
and all that, right?  A bit of Gibson, Sterling, Stephenson et al.?  (I<br>
still don't understand why you use the word 'intrinsic', though.)<br>
<p>
And how is Constructionist AI to find all this out? Some of the<br>
variables reflected in price are simply not gatherable as information:<br>
individuals' 'know-how', for instance.  Is the AI going to do a kind of<br>
cyborg Vulcan mind meld or something: and would that be with peoples'<br>
consent or without? Or is it just going to torture the information out<br>
of people? You want to know something? Even if your AI tortured me to<br>
find out how I'm able to drink a cup of tea, I still couldn't tell it!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Also, in what way are consumers 'captive', if they have a choice?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On my website I put up "Counter Capitalism" a revealing juxtaposed</i><br>
<i>&gt;analysis comparing capitalism (corporatism, merchantilism or what have</i><br>
<i>&gt;you) to Bob Penny's critique of mind-control Scientology-like cults.</i><br>
<i>&gt;From which I quote:</i><br>
<i>&gt;-</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
[interesting stuff snipped]<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
All this has nothing to do with capitalism, though it might have<br>
something to do with corporatism and mercantilism, if I understand you<br>
correctly. We are not using words in the same way, I think.  To me, Capitalism<br>
means free markets and a functioning price system in a context of the<br>
rule of law (as opposed to the rule of men - or AIs). Where that doesn't<br>
exist, you don't have capitalism. The systems we actually have in most<br>
contemporary Democracies are mercantile semifascist /semisocialist with<br>
a sprinkling of capitalism holding them together.<br>
<p>
Society exists for the benefit of individuals, not for the benefit of<br>
'society', of  Ordnung,  or of some AI's good housekeeping. It so<br>
happens that individuals are creatures that need to make their own<br>
choices and steer their own way through life, otherwise they get unhappy,<br>
even more unhappy than they get when they've got too many choices and<br>
have to steer their own way through life.  If your AI is going to take<br>
away this liberty and plan society according to *its* vision of how<br>
things should be, that is no different from any other dictator, and the<br>
same flaws accrue, no matter how supposedly  'benevolent' or utilitarian<br>
the dictatorship.<br>
<p>
Can I make a suggestion?  Why not lay off the ganja for a couple of<br>
weeks?  You'll really feel the benefit when you start smoking again! ;-)<br>
