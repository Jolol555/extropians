Eliezer Yudkowsky, &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;, writes a good description of<br>
quantum interference, but there is one point I would word somewhat<br>
differently:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's worse, just *measuring* the photon will influence the probability</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it gets to its target - even if it doesn't deflect the photon by so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much as an inch.  Because when you measure a system, all probability</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplitudes are *immediately* converted to probabilities and the system</i><br>
<i>&gt; "collapses" or is "reduced" to a single branch of reality.  The photon</i><br>
<i>&gt; is suddenly in only one place in only one branch of reality.  This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; known as "the collapse of the wavefunction" or "state-vector reduction".</i><br>
<p>
While this is true, I don't think it is the most informative way to view<br>
the situation.  Collapse of the wave function is not purely a matter of<br>
acquiring information.  It requires interacting with the system.<br>
<p>
Here is Eliezer's very useful diagram, for reference below:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                  1</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                  |           Arrows indicate direction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        A/--------/---2       A single photon leaves START,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         |       D|           and is reflected from mirrors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         |C       |           What is the chance that the photon</i><br>
<i>&gt; START---/--------/B          will reach target 1, or target 2?</i><br>
<p>
In the case of the hypothetical measuring device which collapses the wave<br>
function, it may be OK for it not to "deflect the photon by an inch,"<br>
but it nevertheless will interact with and affect the photon.  If your<br>
measuring device were somehow able to measure (some aspect of) the photon<br>
without altering its quantum state in any way, it would not destroy the<br>
interference, and the photons would continue to all take path 2.<br>
<p>
Consider this hypothetical experiment.  Let the beam splitter C work on<br>
the basis of polarization.  Horizontally polarized photons go through<br>
path A, and vertically polarized photons go through B.  This will work<br>
the same as was described; the photons will be recombined and all will<br>
take path 2.  We can send in photons of any polarization and this will<br>
happen.  With a diagonally polarized photon it in effect has an equal<br>
chance of choosing either path (or you could say that it goes equally<br>
down both paths in some virtual sense).<br>
<p>
Now, create a pair of photons in correlated states as in the EPR<br>
experiment, both diagonally polarized, but such that they will both<br>
produce the same result when their vertical/horizontal polarization<br>
is measured.  Send one into the experiment above, and send the other<br>
into another copy of the experiment.  In each case the photon passes<br>
through its instance of the experiment and comes out path 2.<br>
<p>
Now block path A in the second experiment.  The photon in that experiment<br>
comes out path 1 or is absorbed.  We know which path it is following,<br>
and there is no interference with its "other half".  What happens in<br>
the first experiment?  We know which path the photon is taking from<br>
the results of the second experiment.  In effect, we are measuring the<br>
photon path without disturbing it.  What will happen?  Will the photon<br>
still always head out path 2, or will it sometimes head out path 1 as<br>
when we measured it directly?<br>
<p>
My understanding is that if you work out the math and/or do the<br>
experiment, you will find that measuring the other photon doesn't<br>
change how this one behaves (indeed, if it did, that would be FTL<br>
communication).  This photon continues to go out path 2, even though<br>
you now know which path it is going down every time.<br>
<p>
This is really very logical.  Your second experiment is basically just<br>
being used to measure the vertical/horizontal polarization of the<br>
photon.  Once you have done so, the paired photon can be thought of<br>
simply as vertically or horizontally polarized.  Since sending either<br>
of these two kinds of photons into the experiment leads to them<br>
coming out path 2, it should not be a surprise that measuring the remote<br>
photon leads to this result.<br>
<p>
However this shows that there is more going on here than a simple<br>
model where the photon must take both branches in order to interfere<br>
with itself and leave on path 2.  Eliezer is right that if you<br>
measure that photon within the experiment in order to determine<br>
which path it is taking, you will destroy the interference and allow<br>
it to leave on path 1.  What is wrong is to say that this is because<br>
the measurement collapses the wave function.  Rather, the reason this<br>
happens is because the measurement perturbs the state of the photon.<br>
That is the point I want to get across, which for some reason the<br>
authors of most articles on the strangeness of QM are reluctant to<br>
discuss.<br>
