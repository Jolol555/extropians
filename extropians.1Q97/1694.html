Hi Mitchell, John,<br>
<p>
Thanks for you clarifications on this Mitch, to which I add a few more:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; [John K Clark, to Omega]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I agree that there is no way, absolutely no way Einstein would say there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; " a zero spacetime interval" between Earth and the virgo cluster, but what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; about Cramer? If Cramer were to say there was a zero time difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; earth and what we see in the Virgo cluster then time does not change, it also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stops being a useful concept, but I still see the symbol "t" , for time in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; his equations, and he sure doesn't treat it like a constant equal to zero.</i><br>
<p>
Actually this is exactly what Einstein would say.  The general formula for<br>
spacetime interval is:<br>
<p>
   s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2,   x, y, z, and t all being real.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the spatial distance to the Virgo cluster is zero then the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; distance never changes and is always equal to zero, but you see the symbol</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "L" for length in his equations and he sure doesn't treat it like a constant</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; equal to zero.</i><br>
<p>
Relativity remember, distances in both space and time are relative to the <br>
reference frame your in.  From the perspective of a lightlike reference frame, <br>
they are all exactly zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If there was " a zero spacetime interval" between Earth and the virgo cluster,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then all of spacetime would be a single mathematical point, points have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; internal structure so the idea of spacetime would not be a useful concept.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, the answer to this problem is that distance is path-dependent. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you take a spacelike path from here to the Virgo cluster, the spacetime</i><br>
<i>&gt; length isn't zero, but if you proceed along Earth's future light-cone</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a point where it intersects the Virgo cluster's future light-cone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and follow a lightlike trajectory backwards in time into the Virgo cluster</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself, you've travelled on two paths, each of which has spacetime "length"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of zero.</i><br>
<p>
The same applies on past-light cones too.  All points on any given light cone,<br>
both past and future portions together are relativistically local on lightlike<br>
reference frames and all exist with no spacetime interval.  This is the heart<br>
of the paradox.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think bidirectional local causality is an ingenious idea, but what</i><br>
<i>&gt; bothers me about the transactional interpretation when it's compared to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, Bohm's theory, is that it doesn't really have an exact mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; formulation yet. Cramer suggests that you could decompose a wavefunction</i><br>
<i>&gt; into advanced and retarded components which altogether constitute a</i><br>
<i>&gt; back-and-forth-in-time "causal sequence", but nowhere that I have seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; does he propose a formula or an algorithm for such decomposition.</i><br>
<p>
Supposedly, and I think this is Cramer's word on this, that his trans-<br>
actional interpretation is mathematically identical to orthodox quantum<br>
mechanics, and becomes obvious when one starts using the relativistically<br>
necessary second order differential equation for time.  <br>
<p>
Unlike the first order differential equation for time that non-relativistic<br>
QM uses, second order equations will automatically provide answers that<br>
are bidirectional with time.  In the formal interpretation, these backward<br>
in time answers also carry negative energy, and so nothing really weird<br>
comes from it except for the clarity that 50% of all microcausality is <br>
happening as a result of advanced action.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Something I'd like to figure out: how the operation of quantum computers</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be understood in the transactional interpretation. Would it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the readout operation retrocausally determines which computations</i><br>
<i>&gt; are performed...? John Cramer has e-mail, I'll ask him what HE thinks.</i><br>
<p>
One could say that the time and energy necessary for intermediate cal-<br>
culations is being "borrowed" from the quantum vacuum and then payed back,<br>
but a probably better way to describe it would be as some form of closed<br>
timelike loop that holds up so long as the wavefunction remains coherent.<br>
Still even this doesn't describe well an advanced action system such as<br>
this.  I'll ponder this a bit and see if I can come up with a real good<br>
metaphor that describes what's going on.<br>
