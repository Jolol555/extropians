About a month ago, there was some mention about how 'breaktroughs that would<br>
lead to realization of some of ExI's goals, we're not happening fast enough'<br>
(It was probably Chris Hind, who wrote something to that extent) And<br>
allthough i haven't been around long enough in this group, to know if that<br>
is true, i do feel the same frustration about knowing the possibilities<br>
there are, but not seeing them realized. Whereas Chris' priotity probably<br>
lies in exploring space, i personally would like to add to that, that i feel<br>
implant technology is not being used for all it can be to mankind. The<br>
following is a list of suggestions of how to popularize some of our goals, i<br>
hope people will add to this list, until it becomes interesting enough, for<br>
someone to take notice of it.   <br>
<p>
I. Bodyelectronics as a commercial market.<br>
<p>
Currently, medical technology is coming very close to actually making<br>
prosthetics that work better than 'the real thing', and i can't help but<br>
wonder if it isn't about time someone starts to think about making (those<br>
that could be defined as improvements) commercially available. Or we will<br>
soon face a situation where people will start to voluntarily get involved in<br>
accidents, in order to have their medical insurance provide them with one.<br>
As they would not be available or too expensive otherwise. <br>
<p>
In order for a commercial exploitation of bodyelectronics, you need a<br>
market. Markets for new products are usually created (especially in hi-tech)<br>
by just manipulating peoples feeling of scarcity, by convincing people they<br>
need it. The product itself often only becomes useful to the consumer AFTER<br>
the technological infrastructure has adapted to the new product. (ask<br>
Philips and Sony for details...)     <br>
<p>
I.2 How to create people's interest in cutting in their bodies.<br>
<p>
The popularity of body piercing the last few years, has shown that people<br>
are willing to give up some of their body tissue, if they are convinced it<br>
will heighten their experiences, or that it is estheatically pleasing.<br>
(Anyone please feel free to suplly me with estimated numbers a year, and for<br>
plastic surgery as well) The first bodyelectronics suitable for commercial<br>
exploitation will probably be nothing more than 'gadgets' like Japanese<br>
multi functional watches (with tv sets in them, calculators, radio's etc),<br>
the only difference is that they will be implanted in the arm, under the<br>
skin. By making use of a 'hype' a trend, and all the reasons people buy<br>
something for they don't really NEED, a foundation could be made for a<br>
consumer infrastructure that has a positive attitude towards bodyelectronics.   <br>
<p>
A practical way of working with trends and fashions, is to find an 'avant<br>
garde' a group of trendsetters etc, who are open for the product you are<br>
trying to market. Based on the character of this particular product, i would<br>
go for: the hackers underground, techno musicians etc. Do i need to explain<br>
further ?<br>
<p>
<p>
II. Promoting the space colonization/exploration meme.<br>
<p>
With a little luck, this will be done for us. The recent success of<br>
'independence day', shows that the US military would better justify their<br>
budget by saying there's the treath of an Alien invasion, than by 'the war<br>
on drugs'. The belief in (immediate) contact with intelligent<br>
extra-terrestial life is rapidly becoming a popular 'superstition'.<br>
Something some intelligent people can, and will make extended use of in the<br>
future. <br>
<p>
A few years ago, the SDI project, in a desperate attempt to stop their funds<br>
from being cut off, tried to point out the risk of a major impact from near<br>
earth asteroids and meteorites in general. They timed it a little too soon,<br>
because by the time of the Jupiter impacts most people had forgotten, so i<br>
think it failed, but it did get the media's attention. They just love<br>
'reality tv' horror stories, and anyone with an agenda, would be neglecting<br>
if he didn't make use of that.  <br>
<p>
<p>
III How to promote the space colonization/exploration &amp; transhumanist memes<br>
among the youth, specifically. <br>
<p>
It's a stage i haven't left that long ago, so i can easily reflect on what<br>
influenced my particular ideas about these memes. two selected examples: (by<br>
order of magnitude/appeal)<br>
<p>
Computer Games. <br>
In computer games, there exists a genre called 'world builder/god<br>
simulator'. Most of the games in this genre deal with colonizing planets,<br>
resource management, and ofcourse fighting off aliens. The point of these<br>
games is to balance your resources efficiently, in order to develop new<br>
technology, that will help you balance your resources more efficiently etc.<br>
The goal of most of these games is to conquer the universe, (note that in<br>
some games you CAN make peace and become 'elected' ruler of the galaxy) <br>
<p>
Think away all the traditional aspects of games (the enemy or the aliens,<br>
the fighting) and what you have left is a simplistic resource management<br>
'tutor' which leaves the player with positive attitudes towards: space<br>
colonization/exploration, rapid development of technology, human cultural<br>
expansion, rational resource management etc, etc..<br>
<p>
Also note that in some of the more open minded games, cyborgs are not always<br>
portrayed as 'the ennemy' (one game even allows you play as a race of<br>
uploaded AI's.)<br>
<p>
Many more genres exist that deal with our meme's, but the strategy genre<br>
looks the most promising, as it is one of the few that can include an<br>
'educational' value.<br>
<p>
Comics.<br>
Sci-fi comics are probably the most popular genre in comics, and have far<br>
greater appeal to young people than novels. Allthough in most cases<br>
Posthumans are portrayed as 'the cyborg ennemy', most of them do have a<br>
positive effect on the space exploration/colonization meme however. Many of<br>
the great sci-fi novel authors ideas reach people in this way, (as well as<br>
in TV/movies), as most never care anymore to read sci-fi, as they reach a<br>
certain age. <br>
<p>
Techno music.<br>
I had to swallow my words, because someone pointed out to me that techno<br>
music only promoted 50's retro ideas of technology. But the music alone was<br>
not my only issue. Techno music has a very high partcipation rate among<br>
people who like it. I estimate about 30% of the people who like it, have at<br>
least once tried to make it themselves, which is possible because of the low<br>
costs involved. If nothing else, techno music shows people by active<br>
experience, that machines and electronics can be used for, if not enhance in<br>
certain ways, human creativity. It could be an important factor in showing<br>
people that machines aren't 'the ennemy' and that human elements we hold so<br>
dear (like emotion), can be generated by working with a machine. It may well<br>
reaffirm young peoples trust in machines, giving counterweight to the<br>
media's portraying future societies dominated by machines, where all human<br>
elements have been lost.<br>
     <br>
<p>
Can anyone continue this list ?  I specifically would like some views on how<br>
internet can influece people positively on our memes.<br>
