<i>&gt;There's no reason for the exclamation point except perhaps to remark</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the fact that circumstances conspired to preserve artifacts made</i><br>
<i>&gt;from organic substance for that long.  Stone tools which most people</i><br>
<i>&gt;would say are of comparable complexity to simple wooden spears, if not</i><br>
<i>&gt;more complex, are known from something like two million years before</i><br>
<i>&gt;the present; also dating from a million years ago, or longer, is</i><br>
<i>&gt;indirect evidence of the use of leather containers (polishing of stone</i><br>
<i>&gt;artifacts, or maybe it was bone), and evidence of possible systematic</i><br>
<i>&gt;use of fire (not to say its creation).</i><br>
<p>
Fascinating!  Thanks for the lit summary.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Just what *did* happen to humans in the last 50,000 years?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A fine question; possibly the time should be a little more remote,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but that's a detail.  Biologically, nobody knows, and there is much</i><br>
<i>&gt;controversy.  Culturally, by degrees, fancier technology, and evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;of larger-scale and more sophisticated cooperation.</i><br>
<p>
and Michael Lorrey writes:<br>
<i>&gt;smaller, not bigger. What they probably did not have was a stable enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;community to allow for even tribalism, which would work to develop a</i><br>
<i>&gt;verbal community history, helping to preserve acquired knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
So perhaps are big recent leap was in social, not physical,<br>
technology.  We social technology specialists would like to think so!<br>
