<p>
<p>
We don't all have to agree to buy the same sort of car, why must we all agree <br>
on whether we have a state or not? If you want to belong to a state then do <br>
so, I want no part of it.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I agree that the "government bug" is inherent. There are ways to        </i><br>

        <br>

And if you're wrong, if whatever change you have in mind doesn't work then we <br>
have a disaster, a dictator with the power to control everything.<br>

                 <br>
<p>
I don't know quite what to make of that, no economy on Earth has grown faster <br>
than South Korea over the last 30 years, and Japan is in the middle of the <br>
worst rescission since World War 2.<br>

<i>        &gt;it is "evil" (to use *your* words) if companies and banks invest        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;money in the stock market where it just circulates. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
GOOD GOD! Erik, when you become our king promise me that you'll spend at <br>
least 5 minutes glancing at an Economics textbook.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Everything would be fine if all information would be accessible        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;AND centralized in  one archive </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That word "centralized" sent cold shivers down my spine. Of course only <br>
THE TRUTH would be in that one centralized archive, and of course you would <br>
be the judge as to what was true and what was not.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;even the web would probably not be preserved in  free markets for         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;economic reasons. </i><br>
                   <br>
Huh??<br>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;As soon as big money circulates, goodbye net.</i><br>
                   <br>
Huh??<br>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;Don't forget that the really large net capacities  are owned by the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;state.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
I'm not sure about Germany, but that's certainly not true in the USA, <br>
thank goodness.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;large companies try to crush users who publish unwanted information, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;even in the entertainment area. Without laws, companies will be  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;able to do that much easier.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Let me ask you something straight out, do you really think people should get <br>
government approval before they publish something on the Web?<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;simply killing other companies with force is much cheaper</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Ridiculous, violence is always expensive. If necessary I would spend every <br>
cent I have to protect myself, some people don't like me but I don't think <br>
anybody hates me enough to impoverish themselves to see to my destruction.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They don't pay anyone what he/she's worth, but everyone is paid        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the fewest money  possible. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
And the employees don't demand what he/she's is worth, they demand the most  <br>
money possible. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;So if someone is paid 2$/hour in one company, he will get only         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;2$/hour in the neighbour company</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I wish everybody could get paid 2000$/hour, I wish everybody was immortal too, <br>
but wishing does not make it so. The sad fact is that neither is possible, <br>
at least not yet. If there is a huge number of people who want to work, <br>
can do my job as well  as I can and are currently making 1$/hour, then nobody <br>
is going to pay me more that 2$/hour to do the same thing. You wouldn't pay <br>
me more yourself, unless I was your friend and you wanted to give me charity, <br>
otherwise you'd pay 2 people 1$/hour, you'd get twice as much work and help <br>
twice as many people.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;didn't you criticize that I valued people? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I most certainly did not, I value people as much as you do.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Don't you always get totally upset if I call the majority of the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;American population uneducated? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, that doesn't make me upset, what upsets me is your wish to enforce your  <br>
opinion on others. In your posts you have said that people read the wrong <br>
books, watch the wrong programs on TV, go to the wrong movies, buy the wrong  <br>
products, use the wrong computer operating system, send foolish E-mail and <br>
visit bad web pages. Well, perhaps so, I have strong opinions on some of <br>
these things too. What scares the hell out of me however is when you make it <br>
clear that you intend to make others have the same opinions about these <br>
things that you do, whether they like it or not. Eric, no offense, but I <br>
wouldn't trust anyone with that much power.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;bad education (much worse in free markets).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Unfortunately we have public schools so education is not part of the free <br>
market, that's why it's so bad. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if you quit a work where the supply is higher than the demand, no          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;one will pay you more if there are thousands of unemployed people         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;willing to work  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, I couldn't have said it better myself. You think this indicates <br>
there must to a villain lurking about determined to make people's lives  <br>
miserable, I agree, but the villain's name is not Capitalism, it's poverty,  <br>
there is simply not enough wealth for everybody to live as they would like to. <br>
Sympathy will not create more net wealth, neither will charity, or moral<br>
outrage, or government regulation, or socialism, but Capitalism will.                                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do you think that  one of these  [billionaires] 360 guys [...] is </i><br>
<i>        &gt;able to spend even 1 per cent of his/her money?</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
No I do not, that means that the vast majority of their money is not used for <br>
personal luxuries but is used in ways that the billionaire thinks will make <br>
even more wealth. Considering the fact that the man was smart enough to make <br>
all that money in the first place, do you really believe that politicians <br>
could use that money to increase the net wealth of the world more than the<br>
billionaire could?<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I know that you don't have the knowledge necessary  to decide         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;whether free markets are a useful thing or not, and I *think* that          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I do. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If your ideas are more powerful than mine then they will prevail, in the free <br>
market of ideas.                                   <br>
