More efficient, yes, but Usenet also has its subtle charms.  Most<br>
notably, a decentralized flood is really the only way to prevent people<br>
from retracting articles.  And, of course, when retracting articles is<br>
impossible, Max M's point about editing isn't relevant anymore.  The<br>
article with that message id will remain constant forever in an ideal<br>
hypertext system, so referring to that message and its byte range will<br>
always refer to the same data.<br>
<p>
In regards to dejanews and altavista and other archives...  These are<br>
good, but not good enough.  Ideally, the hypertext system would allow<br>
us to move beyond the plaintext discussion of Usenet and into other<br>
media.  Yet even today dejanews wouldn't even THINK of archiving a<br>
binaries group.  Like a library, the hypertext system would have to<br>
be able to deal not only with text but anything and everything which<br>
computer technology might throw at it.  Is this possible?<br>

<p>
Very true, and MIME already accomplishes this...  It doesn't matter<br>
whether my Usenet is running off a DVD disk, a RAID drive or a punch<br>
card so long as the data gets to my computer intact.  MIME will help me<br>
to encode the data and will tell me what medium I'm running.  AND it's<br>
already installed on almost every popular newsreader on the Internet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, I suggest skipping all the R&amp;D of *text-based* systems, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; jumping straight into designing systems that will work for </i><br>
<i>&gt; entertainment and education.</i><br>
<p>
Usenet is a text-based architecture, but it doesn't just contain text.<br>
With MIME and other binary-text converters, Usenet has been retooled to<br>
deal with all conceivable media...  And we can refer to these articles<br>
by message id and byte range, especially if these articles are unique.<br>
<p>
Really, the Usenet is already basically ready to take on hypertext.  It<br>
already does the coarse-grained work by threading subjects together.<br>
With very little effort, this threading could become fine-grained and<br>
non-linear.  Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer BOTH have<br>
tools for reading news with links and binaries embedded in them.  The<br>
framework is already laid out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Who will PROFIT from building this type of system?  Those who own </i><br>
<i>&gt; content. ...Do Ted Turner, Gerald Levin, Michael Ovitz, etc. understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technical requirements for these types of systems?  I would guess </i><br>
<i>&gt; that they don't.  Do ADVERTISERS appreciate the benefits of these </i><br>
<i>&gt; systems.  I'd guess that they do.  FINE-GRAINED PSYCHOGRAPHICS.  Such </i><br>
<i>&gt; systems would enable the tracking of information preferences to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; most subtle levels.</i><br>
<p>
Certainly, this system has obvious benefits for almost everybody.  In<br>
fact, your stimulating education and entertainment could almost emerge<br>
straight from the current Usenet, were it more popular.  But the real<br>
genius of hypertext emerges when the archive is permanent, and the<br>
acquisition of data becomes a constantly expanding time capsule which<br>
anyone can study from, contribute to, and look back on for guidance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe if you target your hypertext ideas to this audience.  You may </i><br>
<i>&gt; find that you get results more quickly than by targeting the W3 </i><br>
<i>&gt; Consortium.</i><br>
<p>
Heh.  No kidding.  Maybe I'm just talking up pipe dreams.  But I still<br>
believe that hypertext is invaluable to the human race.  Is there<br>
anything more we can do to bring it about completely?<br>
