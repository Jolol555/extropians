More on Acinonyx<br>
<p>
Acinonyx is very cheetah like. Not only was he a Solitary hunter, which<br>
already decreases his danger to hominids, but moreover the acynonyx species<br>
didn't distribute over the world until 3 (to 1) mln years ago. I think this<br>
rules out that the big cats could have been a serious danger to the survival<br>
as a species of Australopithecus Afarensis, simply because there were no big<br>
cats around at the time in Africa. <br>
<p>
by the way there was one big acynonix (called pardinensis), the size of a<br>
lion, but this one too only developed in the pleistocene. When man had<br>
already learned to use his tools!<br>
<p>
Look for your aquatic ape theory predator among hyeanids, as other canine<br>
didn't develop until the pleistocene.<br>
