&lt;&lt; We're all idealists, we just have different ideals.  I see<br>
 nothing more fundamentally moral, responsible, life-affirming--<br>
 indeed beautiful-- than the act of trade.  No motive more noble<br>
 than profit. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Life is complex, yet put this way, it looks like a simple transaction, black<br>
and white, one sided... I say there is no one way to do life. And we must<br>
respect that complex and fuzzy side to life.. even learn to like it that way!<br>
<p>
IMO, this post is the same old tune....but there are myriad shades of the<br>
most subtle melodies, many of which elude this simple, principled, rational,<br>
yet one sided, statement...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;No measure of value better than the dollar</i><br>
<p>
This is so dogmatic sounding, I see many things more beautiful than trade.<br>
Profit, yeah yeah... dollars, yes please, lots of them.<br>
Trade is GREAT!!... yet it is not the ONLY thing  a happy life revolves<br>
around, life is about expression. Creativity. Feeling ( oh no ,not feelings<br>
again!). Joy. Acheivement. Discovery! Social interactions of a relaxed, non<br>
traderlike nature  (sometimes just fun, or romantic love). OH yes, my dear,<br>
 it is true our world needs repair,  to respect "Self Empowerment" and life<br>
supporting memes, and the anti-trade altruism (zero sum game as Ayn Randians<br>
like to call it) is a poisonous meme. This can be countered by consciously<br>
embracing, -among other things-, a good , solid, ethical trader principle..<br>
but there is more to life than this kind of yawn...  dollars, work ethics,<br>
principles, debates, being "right'... yawn...<br>
<p>
You may be  right, but then, you may be missing out on something fun!<br>
