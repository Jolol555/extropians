<i>&gt; My personal feeling, based on attempts to learn Loglan, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences of others that I have read about, is that the language is hard</i><br>
<i>&gt; if not impossible to learn and speak naturally.  A more recent linguistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory is Noam Chomsky's idea of universal grammar, which proposes that</i><br>
<i>&gt; all human tongues are constrained by the wiring of the brain to a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; subset of the potentially imaginable languages.  It seems to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Loglan (in at least some of its features) may be outside the range of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what the human brain is wired to speak.  In this way it can be a test</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Chomsky's idea as well as Whorf's, and I'd say the preliminary data</i><br>
<i>&gt; favors Chomsky.</i><br>
<p>
It is already well known that /adults/ have great difficulty learning<br>
a new grammar, and somewhat less difficulty learning new vocabulary.<br>
I have seen no data at all to suggest that Lojban (the only variant<br>
worth considering--Brown's "official" TLI Loglan will probably die<br>
with him) is any different in this regard than other languages.  In<br>
fact there are no studies at all on teaching Lojban to children or to<br>
adults, so it neither supports nor refutes Chomsky's speculation at<br>
this point.  One thing is certain though: a study that isn't done<br>
will never prove anything.<br>
