In response to my statement that I act as though I am a theist to theists in <br>
order to weave my ideas into their belief systems, Lyle Burkhead said, <br>
"Interesting.  Maybe, since Extropians are atheists, you pretend to be an <br>
atheist in your postings to the list, so you can weave your message <br>
into their belief system..."<br>
<p>
That *is* interesting.  I hadn't thought of that...  Maybe I *am* really a <br>
theist, infiltrating the Extropian List, slowly gaining your confidence and <br>
respect, only to lead you down the path of theism and bring you back to God.  <br>
I *am* good at assuming a role.  Hmmm.....  I don't feel like a theist....  <br>
but I don't feel like an atheist either; more like an agnostic, but perhaps I <br>
have assumed the role so thoroughly that I really *believe* I am who I say I <br>
am.  That would be *really* interesting.  Maybe I'm some sort of undercover <br>
Christian missionary, out to bring the heathens (that's you guys) back Home.  <br>
OOOH!  Maybe I underwent some sort of psychological manipulation to make me <br>
forget who I really am and assume a new identity that would help me be more <br>
effective at converting you guys.  Hmmm.....  I *have* been getting pretty <br>
*compassionate* lately in my postings, advocating being *nice* to people and <br>
*helping them* out of their psychological problems.  Sounds like something <br>
*Jesus* would say....  I don't *feel* like I'm pretending to be something I'm <br>
not (but maybe I'm just saying that to throw you guys off...), but I may have <br>
so totally assumed my role, that I *believe* I am agnostic while I'm really a <br>
*mind-sucking theist*.  That would be kind of funny, actually... Or *MAYBE* I <br>
need another glass of Tequila and orange juice.....  Then I can do some <br>
*serious* mindfucking on myself...and those *bastards* will wonder why they <br>
can't de-hypnotize me and turn me back into a Bible-thumping, Jesus loving <br>
Theist again.....  Ha Ha HA!<br>
