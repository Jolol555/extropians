<i>&gt;  Even if De Garis's interpretations are hideous, his facts are still</i><br>
<i>&gt;  facts--"things of substance".   They must be dealt with as such.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;  proper interpretation of those facts is more likely to come up in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  environment of unrestrained discourse.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, I must not be making myself clear, and I again apologize</i><br>
<i>&gt; WHAT I am trying to say that the topic: GENIUS, is of interest and I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; like to discuss it and it's implications to Extropy, leaving behind the de</i><br>
<i>&gt; garis issue and opening it up for a new thread.</i><br>
<p>
I understand, and agree.  But the numbers were brought up, and we had an<br>
interesting discussion on what they might mean, on how that discrepancy<br>
might have come about, and what that implies about the subject of genius.<br>
That is precisely what we were after--a discussion on the nature of<br>
genius.  This one datum is so remarkable that understanding it naturally<br>
leads us to a better understanding of the topic, which is precisely what<br>
we wanted.  If we dismiss it as junk, we can't learn from it.<br>
<p>
How this might relate to Extropy is obvious: what is our society doing<br>
wrong that is squashing the potential genius of our daughters?  And if<br>
the child's environment is such a major factor as it appears, what can<br>
we do to create that environment for more children of both genders?<br>
