<i>&gt;And how do American male news readers</i><br>
<i>&gt;manage to get their timbre way down there like that?  I'm tired of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;squeaky tenor, I want to extrope my voice into something powerfully</i><br>
<i>&gt;befitting a transhuman.  (Phew, I managed to make it relevant to the list at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the last moment...)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Someone I met who had done it said he rolled down his window and sang<br>
at the top of his lungs whenever he was on the freeway.  I think part<br>
of the trick is to talk from your diaphragm instead of from your<br>
throat or chest.  Proper ki-yis in karate are like this.  If you take<br>
classes in large rooms, you could sit in the back and ask questions<br>
and make sure everybody can hear them.  Creativity in finding other<br>
situations in which it's socially acceptable to bellow (I'd say "yell",<br>
but "bellow" has more of a diaphragm (belly, hm) feel) is left for the<br>
student.<br>
<p>
Of course, raw material helps, but I think anyone can affect their<br>
(my concession to changing grammar rules) voice.<br>
