I've recently been thinking about time-reversal symmetry in physics.<br>
This is one of the basic symmetries of existing theories, and John <br>
Cramer's transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics seeks to <br>
explain nonlocal correlations by back-and-forth-in-time ("zigzag")<br>
causality.<br>
<p>
If time-reversal symmetry is real, it ought to be possible to have <br>
beings like ourselves whose "arrow of time" points the other way.<br>
<p>
Is there something paradoxical about the notion of *communication*<br>
between ourselves and countertime beings? Or could we build a<br>
time-reversed robot that reports on the future?<br>
<p>
In the case of time paradox via wormhole, the most popular idea<br>
is that just when two wormholes comes within range of causing a<br>
closed timelike curve, they will be destroyed by vacuum <br>
fluctuations which will repeatedly traverse the neighborhood of<br>
the CTC until the energy density is sufficient to destabilize the <br>
wormholes.<br>
<p>
In the case of countertime communication I see no such convenient<br>
physical mechanism to avoid paradoxes of the form: at time t,<br>
countertime machine A tells "forward-time" machine B that B sent a <br>
signal at time t+dt, and B is programmed not to send the signal if <br>
it receives such a message from A. So perhaps countertime entities <br>
aren't possible, or communication with them is not possible, but <br>
if so, why not?<br>
<p>
(Time reversal has been explored a bit in science fiction:<br>
in a short story by Greg Egan; in Brian Aldiss' *Cryptozoic*;<br>
in Ian Watson's "The Very Slow Time Machine"; probably in<br>
Philip K. Dick, and possibly in Stephen Baxter. No doubt<br>
Damien B can suggest a few more...?)<br>
