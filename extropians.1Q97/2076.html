[said I:]<br>
<i>&gt; } Whoa!  We aren't talking transhumans here; transhumans would simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; } communicate *thought* directly without need for language.  Telepathy, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; } a word.  After all, (your) thought to English to (your friend's)</i><br>
[Damien Broderick replies:]<br>
<i>&gt; Many of my thoughts, especially the rigorous ones, are in English.  At</i><br>
<i>&gt; any rate, I don't buy your thesis: thoughts won't magically jump from</i><br>
<i>&gt; one mind to another, unless they're borging, and whatever you use to</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicate complex ideas between discrete minds is language.</i><br>
<p>
I'm using language in the sense of, say, describing whatever Broca's<br>
area does, not in the sense of "programming language" or "encoding". <br>
Sure, if I transfer visual experiences directly from my occipital lobe<br>
to yours, you could call it "language", but this is torturing the<br>
phrase.  No words, no syntax, no symbols - no language.<br>
<p>
As for Damien's point about the "rigorous" thoughts being in English...<br>
did I post my conjecture about the linguistic-semantic cycle here? <br>
Apparently not.  Well, anyway, from a discussion with someone who<br>
started talking about "models of models of models of self" in the mind:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Rather than moving offs in the direction of self-referential</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinals, I prefer to conceptualize the mind as being composed of many</i><br>
<i>&gt; interacting modules, many of which have the power to refer to each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other.  This discrete model removes many of the paradoxes involved in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "self-reference" which results from viewing the mind as a unitary</i><br>
<i>&gt; lump, and gave rise to the "meta-perceptions *are* perceptions" model of</i><br>
<i>&gt; modelling above.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     For example, your reasoning thoughts also present themselves as</i><br>
<i>&gt; auditory data which are then interpreted by the sentence-understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt; module as semantic data about which we can reason; it is this loop which</i><br>
<i>&gt; allows one to reason about reason and which is responsible for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; belief that language has something to do with thought and</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
So yeah, I agree with Damien's statement for humans:  The rigorous<br>
thoughts are in English because it's by hearing those thoughts that we<br>
reason about them, remember them, and fill in the blanks.  But there<br>
could be a better way.  Our future selves may call it the "linguistic<br>
bottleneck" instead of "linguistic self-awareness".<br>
