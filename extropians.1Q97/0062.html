<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; So what does it mean, to create a market where there wasn't any?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When the first PC's where made you couldn't go into a store and buy one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You couldn't even imagine what it was going to be used for. Spreedsheets</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't exist so you couldn't use them. Wordprocessors didn't exist either</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. etc. (i'm making an oversimplification here) So therefore there wasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;any market for it. You didn't know you had the need.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When they hit the market the use for the technology gradually grew and</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The distinction here is that most new products fill a commonly recognized<br>
need.  Microwave ovens were in response to the need of people to heat things<br>
fast.  In the case of microwave ovens, the producer was responding to the<br>
needs of the consumer.<br>
<p>
In the case of a few products (tentatively PCs here), the producer is<br>
creating a product that is new, but as yet does not fill any commonly<br>
recognized need.  The tough part here is making the consumer aware of the<br>
fact that they need this product, even if they aren't aware of the need.<br>
<p>
A good example of this is Post-It (tm) notes.  Infinitely used and useful,<br>
but no one was aware of the need until the product became available.  I<br>
understand that 3M (the original producer) bought the patent for pocket change.<br>
