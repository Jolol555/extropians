<p>
I expect there always to be a list where the topics of conversation are<br>
open. This untamed and unmoderated list will probably always have a place.<br>
We do intend to create specialist lists (see the new issue of Exponent for<br>
details) to provide forums for very high quality discussion.<br>
<p>
When will this happen? The speed of implementation depends on whether<br>
someone spearheads the project. I cannot do that, given my current<br>
commitments. I'm looking for someone to do the main work on this project. If<br>
no one suitable is found, the new set of lists will still arise, but more<br>
slowly. <br>
<p>
If ExI had a staff of paid, full-timers, things like this would get done<br>
much more quickly. Alas, we have *no* full-time, paid staff. There are many<br>
transhumanists who have not joined in the Extropy Institute effort, which<br>
holds back progress. If all the transhumanists/extropians around actually<br>
pitched in, ExI would have more resources of all kinds to do things like<br>
list reform, additional conferences, regular publications, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some symptoms of the dread disease: a noticeable fraction of technically</i><br>
<i>&gt;minded people have unsubscribed from the list </i><br>
<p>
People come and go all the time, This has happened over the last years that<br>
the list has been running. Yes, some of it is due to too much discussion of<br>
topics not interesting to the individual. But it's also due to people<br>
wanting to focus on things other than talk on a list. Some of those who<br>
leave later return, when they feel they have more time to spend reading and<br>
writing on an email list.<br>
