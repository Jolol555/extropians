<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The last thing I want is mean spirited, cantakerous "bastards" or "bitches",</i><br>
<i>&gt;  telling me what is best for me. I heard that for years with Bush, Reagan and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dole's campaign...</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is no better than "nice", well meaning, condescending liberals telling me</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is good for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for this "protecting us " from our own stupidity, isnt that EXACTLY what</i><br>
<i>&gt; Optimalized Indivduals dont want?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly what our government is doing just a little TOO well?</i><br>
<i>&gt; This idea is the very destructive, IMAO</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
While I agree with you for the most part, there are any number of<br>
popular ways to vote ourselves into our own destruction, in both<br>
political directions. I referred to such a court as a BRAKE, not a<br>
reverse gear. Thus while it would prevent us from driving ourselves off<br>
cliffs, we could easily override if the need were compelling enough to<br>
warrant passage of amendments to the constitution.<br>
<p>
I especially like a recent amendment passed in Washington State which<br>
says that the legislature only needs a simple majority to LOWER taxes,<br>
but must have a two thirds majority to RAISE taxes. Rather inspired<br>
legislation, IMHO.<br>
<p>
If a superdemocracy were developed like I proposed, it would only be a<br>
few steps toward experimenting with or even adopting across the board<br>
greater levels of indvidual or mini collective sovreignty as individuals<br>
or groups may wish. In such a future, one of the first applications of<br>
AIs would probably be as legal researchers/advisers to wade through<br>
megatons of laws, cases, etc. for individual sovreigns who do not have<br>
the time to waste.<br>
