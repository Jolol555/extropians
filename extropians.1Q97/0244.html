<i>&gt;What?  Shouldn't stock prices *rise* if companies are doing better?  No,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because the government, in the name of "stabilizing" (= slowing down)</i><br>
<i>&gt;the economy, raises interest rates that should be set by private</i><br>
<i>&gt;bankers, thus causing bonds to be more attractive than stocks.  Or maybe</i><br>
<p>
 Any competent banker would raise interest rates in response to stronger<br>
than expected economic growth, because that indicates stronger than<br>
expected demand for capital, usually without an equivalent increase in<br>
the supply of capital.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"The Incredible Bread Machine" is a fine reference on how the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;boom-and-bust cycle is intrinsic to government, not capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
 Given this book's reputation as a simple intro to libertarian<br>
economics, I'm willing to believe it shows that government is often<br>
a sufficient explanation for business cycles, but I will assume your<br>
claim that it shows they wouldn't happen without government is a joke<br>
unless you can give some hints about how it demonstrates that. Proving<br>
the absence of a phenomenon can be pretty hard.<br>
 Does it provide historical examples of economies that were recession-<br>
free due to the absence of government influence? Does it disprove<br>
all of the hypothesized causes of business cycles that are independant<br>
of governments (such as those described in Schumpeter's _Business Cycles_<br>
or in Soros' _Alchemy of Finance_)?<br>

<p>
 It's a dangerous fallacy because it's half true - changes in the<br>
inflation rate influence when umemployment happens.<br>
<p>
 the *only* thing that causes inflation is the government<br>
<i>&gt;printing money.</i><br>
<p>
 I'm fairly sure I read a report of a major decline in the value<br>
of a currency in Thucidytes (centuries before governments figured out<br>
how to print money) - caused by a plague which convinced most people<br>
that they wouldn't live long enough for saving money to be of any help.<br>

<i>&gt;Capitalism is an inherently stable, symmetrical, self-organizing</i><br>

<p>
 Capitalism has checks and balances which work almost perfectly in<br>
the presence of perfect information, fail almost completely under<br>
conditions of total ignorance. We operate under conditions which<br>
are far from those extremes.<br>
