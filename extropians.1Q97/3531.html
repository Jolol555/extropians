<i>&gt; The problem with Retinal Degenerative Diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Age Related Macular Degeneration (of which most people will develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; unless aging is slowed)  is that the retinal cells die. How will these</i><br>
<i>&gt; chips work with inactive cells?</i><br>
<p>
I found something on the web that might be of interest, but your<br>
question of how these chips will work with atrophied retinas is a great<br>
question.  I think Chris has it when he says the optical nerve is a good<br>
idea.  This device I read about on the net displays images on the retina<br>
directly.  Eventually, they want to reduce it to the size of<br>
sunglasses.  They have an article on people w/low vision, and how this<br>
VRD(Virtual Retinal Display) can help them.  It seems the lab is working<br>
with VR from looking at their projects.  Here's the URL:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/projects/vrd/">http://www.hitl.washington.edu/projects/vrd/</a><br>
<p>
Go ahead and check out their other projects.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The optic nerve remains intact but there are claims it is too difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; to attach to. </i><br>
<p>
Ahh, but it was once too difficult to get off the surface of<br>
earth(although, it still is too expensive, but hopefully, with the new X<br>
series of vehicles, it will provide a cheaper means of escape).  There<br>
were claims the earth was flat.  There are all kinds of claims that have<br>
been proven wrong.  I believe that we can do it.  It may take a while,<br>
but it's not impossible.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
This amazes me since my sisters cochlear implant and newest<br>
<i>&gt; speach processor have returned almost all her hearing. How is the optic</i><br>
<i>&gt; nerve so much different from the auditory nerve that we can successful</i><br>
<i>&gt; interface with the auditory nerve but not with the optic nerve?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If we can incorporate CCTV  magnification technology, OCR (Optical</i><br>
<i>&gt; Charachter Recognition), and light filtering mechanisms,  with</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological/artificial eyes,  subcutaneous computer chips, and the optic</i><br>
<i>&gt; nerve, we'd be in a good position to cure many forms of blindness. We'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; also greatly enhance human ability to use our sense of sight in far</i><br>
<i>&gt; greater ways.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Hey, imagine if we started working on similar technologies for the ear<br>
implants.  The ability to hear distances greater than we can normally<br>
hear now.  The ability to hear a whisper without straining.  The ability<br>
to adjust our level of hearing based on who's speaking(I have this<br>
problem at work with a soft spoken co-worker), the ability to filter<br>
backgroun noise.  The ability to "turn off sound", so as not to damage<br>
our ears(kind of like ear plugs).  All kinds of possibilities.<br>
<p>
 Far range vision, macro-micro, UV,<br>
<i>&gt; IR, thermal imaging, photo sensitive shading, downloading everything you</i><br>
<i>&gt; saw that day to computer backup, - endless possibilities.  </i><br>
<p>
Oh, please, please, please, don't taunt me like that.  I can't wait<br>
until that day.  MMM, MMM, MMM!!!<br>
<p>
<p>
The ultimate<br>
<i>&gt; would be interfacing computer  output directly into your optic nerve</i><br>
<i>&gt; without needing a monitor to give new meanings to the terms  VR and</i><br>
<i>&gt; portability .</i><br>
<p>
This is similar to the VRD that I mentioned above, except instead of the<br>
Optic Nerve, it works with the retina.  I'm sorry it probably won't be<br>
able to help you, but it's a start on something.  Don't forget to check<br>
out the page.<br>
<p>
