This is one version of what some of us are calling the Linde<br>
scenario. It is predicated upon the possibility of traversible<br>
wormholes and baby universes. Most of what follows is science<br>
fiction rather than technological extrapolation, in the sense <br>
that there's no rigorous argument that the step in question is<br>
possible, but one has to start somewhere.<br>
<p>
An updated version of this scenario will live at <br>

<p>
The Linde scenario, v0.01<br>
<p>
<p>
The basic steps are:<br>
<p>
1. Establish an industrial base in space<br>
2. Manufacture wormholes<br>
3. Spawn a baby universe and enter it<br>
4. Tame that universe, spawn more from within it; repeat ad infinitum<br>
<p>
In more detail:<br>
<p>
<p>
1. Establish an industrial base in space.<br>
<p>
I assume that this will be necessary for wormhole manufacture, which<br>
may require very low gravity and/or very high energies that are<br>
not available on Earth. Paths to industrializing space have been<br>
described in many places, for example in Marshall Savage's book<br>
_The Millennial Project_ (see <a href="http://www.millennial.org">http://www.millennial.org</a>). <br>
<p>
Essentially this is a matter of locating space resources, reaching<br>
them, and using them.<br>
<p>
<p>
2. Manufacture wormholes<br>
<p>
Here we jump straight into the science-fiction part. I am not aware<br>
of a single reliable scheme for wormhole manufacture. One could<br>
classify schemes as follows:<br>
<p>
* Find naturally occurring macroscopic wormholes (e.g. cosmological<br>
  remnants)<br>
* Find naturally occurring microscopic wormholes (e.g. from <br>
  Planck-scale space-time fluctuations) and inflate them<br>
* Artificially induce a topology change<br>
<p>
The first scheme may require travel across light-years, if such<br>
remnant wormholes exist at all; while the second may be problematic <br>
(it would seem to require the creation of an inflationary domain <br>
around the wormhole, and how would you get hold of it again having <br>
done that?). <br>
<p>
The third scheme, although in some ways the most speculative, strikes <br>
me as the most promising. String theory has already been used to<br>
describe a form of topology change [Greene, Morrison, Strominger,<br>
"Black Hole Condensation and the Unification of String Vacua",<br>
hep-th/9504145], so perhaps we can imagine that in the 21st century, <br>
when the theory of quantum gravity is mature, we will be able to <br>
figure out how to induce such changes.<br>
<p>
John Cramer once suggested (Analog, "The Alternate View", March 1996;<br>
<a href="http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw77.html">http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw77.html</a>) that one could make a <br>
mini black hole with an asteroidal mass of rubidium, using Bose-Einstein<br>
condensation, but according to John Baez (in correspondence) Fermi <br>
interactions among nucleons would interfere with this process. <br>
Nonetheless the general idea of making mini black holes using BECs <br>
might work for some other substrate.  Perhaps we can then imagine <br>
colliding mini black holes and looking for stable micro wormholes <br>
amongst the collision remnants. (This may sound a little arbitrary,<br>
but I recall reading that the weak energy condition which would be<br>
violated in the wormhole interior is also violated near the<br>
event horizon of black holes. The search for a citation for this<br>
is in progress!)<br>
<p>
What would these wormholes be like? Let's assume that they're<br>
spherical wormholes, whose throats are stabilized by exotic matter.<br>
A single wormhole will look like two small balls of exotic matter,<br>
but the inside of one ball is the outside of the other; in other<br>
words, if you could drill into one ball, you would find your drill<br>
emerging from the other. The region of exotic matter would therefore<br>
have the topology of a thick-shelled hollow sphere (S^2 x I).<br>
<p>
Having produced micro wormholes, one will want to catch them, store<br>
them, and eventually manipulate them - move the ends around, make<br>
them bigger, make them traversible. All of this depends on the<br>
interactions of exotic matter with ordinary matter; if it has<br>
electric charge or color (chromodynamic) charge, one may be able<br>
to drag it around electromagnetically, store it in nucleonic cages,<br>
and so on.<br>
<p>
To make a spherical micro wormhole such as I've described <br>
traversible, it needs to be increased in size at least to nanometer<br>
dimensions, and the shape of the exotic region needs to be changed<br>
so that particles can get through. One might be able to make the<br>
wormhole bigger by manufacturing exotic matter and dropping it in,<br>
or by exciting the exotic matter that already holds the throat open.<br>
As for a traversible wormhole, a donut shape (topology T^2 x I) <br>
might be a simple start. One could try to reach this by causing<br>
the spherical exotic droplet to spin, becoming oblate, and then<br>
by making a pole-to-pole hole in pancake-shaped droplet. <br>
<p>
So, the highly speculative procedure described thus far amounts to<br>
<p>
* Make micro black holes<br>
* Collide them and look for stable micro wormholes among the products<br>
* Collect micro wormholes and store them<br>
* Introduce energy to make the wormholes bigger, traversible, etc<br>
* Ship them where needed (e.g. to the stars!)<br>
<p>
The advantage of microscopic wormholes is that they can probably be<br>
made to move very fast. Nature manages to produce 10^20 eV cosmic rays<br>
[John Walker], which will cross millions of light-years in 30 minutes<br>
"subjective time"; if one could send one end of a micro wormhole into <br>
space at such speeds, within 30 minutes one's home system would have<br>
a wormhole connection to regions of space millions of light-years<br>
away. One might circumnavigate a closed universe in days. This would<br>
lead to the "wormhole empires" described by Michael Price <br>
[Michael Price, "Traversable Wormholes", Extropy #11; <br>
<a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Space-Time/wormholes.html">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Space-Time/wormholes.html</a>].<br>
<p>
Far-travelling wormholes also move far into the future, relative to <br>
the cosmological reference frame (in which the cosmic background <br>
radiation is at equilibrium), so this would be a way for people in <br>
the present to probe the far future of the universe. If our<br>
universe is spatially closed (e.g. with topology S^3), the probing<br>
of the future would be limited by the radius of the universe.<br>
If one's wormhole network expands spherically, one can't send a probe<br>
far beyond the "cosmic antipodes" (the point in space opposite the<br>
network's point of origin) without risking the creation of<br>
closed timelike curves and the likely destruction of one's wormhole<br>
through the Visser effect (or some other chronology protection<br>
mechanism).<br>
<p>
Another spin-off of wormhole technology might be unusual rocket<br>
designs, in which reaction mass was fed into the rocket via a<br>
wormhole mounted in front of the engine, from remote stockpiles<br>
of fuel.<br>
<p>
<p>
3. Spawn a baby universe and enter it<br>
<p>
An intriguing recent idea is that, rather than simply collapsing<br>
into a singularity, the region of space constituting a black hole<br>
pinches off from its parent spacetime and (upon reaching sufficient<br>
density) inflates into a new universe. The idea behind step #3<br>
of our plan is to shoot one end of a wormhole into a collapsing<br>
supermassive object, in the hope that it will enter the future<br>
inflationary region, avoid destruction, and survive into the<br>
post-primeval era of the new universe.<br>
<p>
I have already speculated that one might be able to make micro<br>
black holes; I might further speculate that they are not very<br>
suitable for the above procedure, because of their smallness <br>
and their brief lifespans. In that case, perhaps we need to<br>
proceed as follows:<br>
<p>
* Travel to a star on the edge of supernova<br>
* Introduce very large numbers of caged pico wormholes into<br>
  the star (when I say "caged wormhole" I imagine an atomic <br>
  nucleus inside which is one end of a wormhole)<br>
* Position them so they will survive stellar implosion,<br>
  inflation, and scattering in the new universe<br>
* Wait for collapse... <br>
<p>
If everything works, you now have a wormhole link to a second <br>
universe.<br>
<p>
<p>
4. Tame that universe, spawn more from within it; repeat ad infinitum<br>
<p>
Presumably you don't want to wait millions or billions of years for<br>
your new universe to cool, for stars to form, etc. So you open <br>
your transuniversal wormholes (i.e. make them traversible), ship<br>
materials through, build relativistic rockets, cage your wormholes <br>
and put them inside, and then rocket the wormholes into the age<br>
of stellar and planetary formation in short subjective time,<br>
thanks to time dilation.<br>
<p>
Now, if you want this whole universe under your control, you <br>
should construct and send wormhole-bearing probes into every<br>
solar system. In supergiant systems, you can repeat steps #3 and #4.<br>
Otherwise, you have a whole new universe in which to construct<br>
megastructures, evolve ecosystems, explore spontaneously-occurring<br>
natural phenomena like natively evolving civilizations, and so on.<br>
