When I say "sex-linked," I use the term's biological meaning:  That one<br>
or more genes appear on the X or Y chromosome which influence genius.<br>
This, obviously, is not yet established as FACT.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, what's at issue is *why* it's a fact.  Lactating breasts</i><br>

<i>&gt; Penis size is almost entirely sex linked - that's traditionally part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; job description.</i><br>
<p>
Lactating breasts is a recessive trait which appears on the X chromo-<br>
some, while owning a penis is a dominant trait which shows up on the Y<br>
chromosome.  These traits are obviously sex-linked.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But deeper than such markers are the associated genes,</i><br>

<p>
I'm familiar...  I don't see how it relates, though.<br>

<p>
That his brain had been androgenised in utero???  It looks to me like<br>
the really significant event occured LONG after being carried to full<br>
term.<br>
