But that's all I was saying, really.  I was responding to what looked to<br>
me like a dissing of techno based on ignorance of those 'roots'.  Nobody<br>
needs to take drugs for anything, but if you want to really understand<br>
techno, you have to have 'been there' at least once; then the 'gestalt' of<br>
the music is unlocked to you, and you can listen to it straight quite<br>
happily and still get it.  Without that experience, a critique of techno<br>
is like somebody colour blind critiquing Van Gogh: they'll understand<br>
the form, light, and line, but not the colour.<br>
