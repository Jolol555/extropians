<i>&gt;adapted from Friedman's excellent but basic price theory textbook, </i><br>
<i>&gt;PRICE THEORY. Now when I first read PRICE THEORY, I thought, "Gee, </i><br>

<i>&gt;as a scary college econ textbook." It seems to me that HIDDEN ORDER</i><br>
<i>&gt;addresses this packaging concern perfectly.</i><br>
<p>
I read it a few months ago.  (After being named in the dedication, how<br>
could I resist?)  <br>
<p>
Yes, its a price theory textbook pretending to be a chatty book for<br>
the rest of us.  Nice examples, but there are some places where the<br>
reader will have to pay attention and really think or get lost (like a<br>
textbook).<br>
<p>
I'm not sure how many people will fall for that, but D.D.Fr. claims at<br>
least a few thousand.  I'm not sure how many of them have already read<br>
an intro econ text.<br>
