<p>
Check out our religious friends on that one.  I think it's about 40% of the<br>
population.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;COmmunism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Socialism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;SDI</i><br>
<p>

<p>
There are values here, yes (except not for SDI, I think).   But with all of<br>
them there remains substantial disagreement over whether they "work" i.e.<br>
produce a successful society that meets basic goals like food, shelter,<br>
security, etc.  Lots of leftists hold up pre-Thatcherite England as an<br>
example of how socialism "works" and post-Thatcherite England as an example<br>
of how capitalism "doesn't work".  Rightist generally do the opposite.<br>
<p>
SDI was almost purely phrased as an arguement over whether it would "work"<br>
i.e., stop enough nuclear warheads to reduce civilian casualties to at most<br>
those typical of a major war.  Interestingly, the opinions seemed to be<br>
dependent almost solely on whether the opinioned believed it would be a good<br>
thing for the US to be immune to nuclear blackmail.  Those distrustful of the<br>
US military almost always said it would fail; the rah-rah patriots almost<br>
always said it would work.  Hmmm.   <br>

<i>&gt;&gt;JFK assasination</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Roswell Incident</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;MLK assasination</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the Rosenberg Trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the Alger Hiss trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Contragate (esp. Ollie North)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;where I know lots of people suspect foul play, but I'm sure most people</i><br>
<i>&gt;really disagree on estimating the chances of such.</i><br>
<p>
The point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I really think these three word titles are not a sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;description of each dispute to evaluate their status regarding this</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue.  More details please.</i><br>
<p>
Are you saying that you are *not* aware of at least major factual point in<br>
each one that is seriously in dispute?  <br>
<p>
For JFK, I'd name the single bullet theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;What evidence is there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that *any* people, never mind ordinary ones, act like good Bayesian agents,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;apart from in science?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;With "like" being the key word, lots of evidence.  But</i><br>
it is a standard first approximation.  <br>
<p>
Can you provide me some references?  I'm always open to evidence :-) but I've<br>
never seen anything which assumed that people generally were - or even could<br>
be - good Bayesian agents.<br>
