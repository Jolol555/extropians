Eli rants and raves about things said in the Discover article that<br>
he attributes to "trained chimpanzees".<br>
<p>
Allow me to translate -- I used to get bad grades in English because<br>
I looked too deeply into things for meaning, and have since learned<br>
to do an amazing variety of translation -- translating what an English<br>
speaker listening to Geekonics translated it to into what the original<br>
Geekonics speakers might have written if they spoke English.  Kids,<br>
don't try this at home.<br>
<p>
The article says "Atoms in [a quantum] computer would replace transistors<br>
and other electronic components, greatly shrinking the size and increasing<br>
the power of computers.  In a quantum computer, one atom could<br>
simultaneously represent a zero and a one in the binary language of<br>
computers.  In conventional computers, each number of binary code must<br>
be stored separately."  I'm guessing that the discussion ended at this<br>
point because the article writer get completely lost.<br>
<p>
What it means is:  "In a quantum computer, the transistors and other<br>
electronic components could be made of one, or a hundred, or a thousand<br>
atoms each, rather than the billions of atoms they are made of today.<br>
Computers could therefore be built much smaller.  Also, since in a<br>
quantum computer a single atom can simultaneously represent a zero<br>
(say, spin-down) and a one (spin-up), a single processor can be used to<br>
explore two possibilities at once, and, for example, a case statement<br>
that has two choices with the same outcome can represent both choices<br>
in the same space.  Such a computer would be much faster and more<br>
powerful than any we could make today."<br>

Gotta go to work.<br>
