slower? I don't think so. Any rock will accelerate the same regardless<br>
of mass, as Galileo proved, and the bigger it is, the more momentum it<br>
has so its harder to deflect from its course with a given repulsive<br>
charge. The time from luna to earth is 1-3 days, depending on trajectory<br>
taken and excess velocity when crossing the L1 point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or to launch a crushing counterattack.</i><br>
<p>
Since luna does not NEED to attack earth, the onus will be on earth to<br>
attack first. This puts earth gov't in a poor PR position, where they<br>
will have to fabricate some terrorist bombing or something to rouse up<br>
public sentiment to support their inhumane actions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whereas if Earth wanted to attack first, I've already argued that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; could hit Luna in 8 hours, by putting missiles and their fuel in Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; orbit first.  Actually I was wrong; using a better mean distance (384400</i><br>
<i>&gt; km) the time is more like 9.7 hours.</i><br>
<p>
You were projecting the use of a propulsin system so efficient that it<br>
could accelerate constantly at above one G from the earth to the moon?<br>
You must really beleive in the Lorry Drive!!!!<br>
<p>
And an easily detectable military mobilization in orbit will be seen to<br>
be as much of a threat by any non allied nations on earth, raising<br>
political cain on earth, in the UN, and in the media, which can be<br>
easily used by loonies for propaganda purposes (i.e. Jane FOnda, El<br>
Salvador, the Pentagon Papers, Iran-Contra). In addition, the logistical<br>
costs of putting earth resources in orbit (since they won't be able to<br>
get them from the moon) add additional expense to such an endeavor.<br>
<p>
You don't really understand the magnitude of what you are saying. It<br>
took $60 billion in equipment losses and expenses operating a trillion<br>
dollars in equipment with the cooperation of over a dozen nations to<br>
mount a successful 8 day campaign here ON EARTH to recover 100 square<br>
miles of desert wasteland.<br>
<p>
There is a HUGE differential in the costs that a defender must incur vs <br>
the attacker to win a confrontation. Here on earth the differential can<br>
be as much as 1 to 100. It is known by vets that any attack that only<br>
outnumbers defenders by 10 to 1 has a very small chance of taking a hill<br>
or other redoubt. The 10th Mountain Div. in WWII lost 90% of its troops<br>
taking a small part of the Italian Alps back from the Nazis, who were in<br>
a retreat (and thus had poor morale, yet succeeded in incurring heavy<br>
losses), and required three tries to finally take the assigned<br>
territory.<br>
