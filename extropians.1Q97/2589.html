Yes. The Wall Street Journal often reports how capitalist foundations <br>
flirt with socialist causes; or just yesterday, Ford fawns to its <br>
unions to find labor peace, stiffing suppliers who can't afford such <br>
fine fixtures.<br>
<p>
&lt;... or they would have invested here instead of elsewhere.&gt;<br>
<p>
Hmmm, why should they distinguish here from there? Must adventurers <br>
always be judged as pirates just because they see easier pickings over <br>
the uncharted horizon? On the other hand, consider the ultimate <br>
entrepreneurs, farmers, who have the audacity to cultivate compost, <br>
computing with dirt, to turn barren deserts into juicy desserts.<br>
<p>
The following emphatically expresses what I have in mind here:<br>
<p>
"Pirates gained superiority when they learned that one ship could <br>
carry more things than could a mule's back - that it could go anywhere <br>
in the world.... Pirates of the high seize passed on their secrets - <br>
on the ways of the world - to 'captains of industry', the new <br>
pirates.... When captains of industry found that Earth's resources <br>
were unevenly distributed, they used ships to bring the 'burried <br>
treasures' together.  Their economic power boomed.... Mariners lived <br>
in a state of continuous discovery.  They had to develop mathematics <br>
to survive.... The closer man lives to the unknown, the more inventive <br>
he becomes - the quicker he adopts new ways."<br>
- R. Buckminster Fuller, _I Seem To Be A Verb_, 1970, pgs 104-124<br>
