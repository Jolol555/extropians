<i>&gt; John?  Sure, Murdoch's paper might be readable.  But say it costs $.50</i><br>
<i>&gt; to produce, at which price I prefer to read a different paper.  But when</i><br>
<i>&gt; Murdoch's paper is free, I'm willing to read it instead of the paper I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to pay for.  Eventually that paper goes out of business and Murdoch</i><br>
<i>&gt; starts charging $.50 again.  Now I'd like to read something better, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the competitor is out of business, and if it is non-trivial to start a</i><br>
<i>&gt; new paper I may be stuck with reading Murdoch or nothing.  So I read</i><br>
<i>&gt; Murdoch.  Not an ideal solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not saying what should be done about it, or that something should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; done, but it does seem to be a sub-ideal solution at least, and if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't disprove that you should acknowledge it, or people you'd like to</i><br>
<i>&gt; convince will think you're a nut and not listen to you.</i><br>
<p>
Why is it "non-trivial" to start a new paper?  Because the government<br>
taxes a new business to death, requires license fees, minimum wage for<br>
new workers, drives up the cost of supplies with regulation, creates<br>
zoning laws to prevent you from putting the press in your garage, puts<br>
strict regulations on banks to make it harder for them to lend you the<br>
startup cash, passes anti-trust laws to prevent you and other papers<br>
from colluding against the giant to beat him at his own game, and a<br>
thousand other barriers to entry.  Sure, the big guy climbed that hill<br>
too, but now he can look at you down there in the valley and laugh; the<br>
government created the mountain, and once the first one climbs it, he<br>
can use it to keep out competition.  Without the government, the playing<br>
field stays level.<br>
<p>
And who says you need a damned paper anyway?  Last time I looked, humans<br>
needed food, water, and air.  If you don't like Murdoch, don't buy the<br>
paper.  I get sick of hearing people whine about cable TV rates--I don't<br>
own a TV.  I don't want one, I don't need one, I don't pay for it. 99% of<br>
the things people complain about the price of are luxuries (with the rare<br>
exceptions like the cost of rice in Japan).<br>
