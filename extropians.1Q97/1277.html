<p>
Currently, only humans are doing research. Machines are but tools <br>
(growing smarter, granted). Cancel the humans from the equation now, and <br>
everything will come to a crashing halt. What we need is the <br>
sustainability of R &amp; D progress (wonderful term, this) in the absence <br>
of of humans. In a pinch, a pretty smart von Neumann ecosystem should <br>
suffice, after we're gone.<br>
<p>
Hardware requirements for a human equivalence _are_ exorbitant. Do your <br>
back of the envelope, semiconductors won't do. Molecular circuitry is <br>
required, which is not easy to do at all.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ barriers ]</i><br>

That has zero significance if I can't predict it. A <br>
theoretical/metaphysical result merely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; transactional interpretation of QM [a subject for the free-will thread])</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I don't agree with your assessment of the relevant technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wormholes?  Relativistic physics?  Whoa, I know I mentioned the pos-</i><br>
<p>
While wormholes is lunatic fringe technology, our current circuitry is <br>
already constrained by (relativistic) physics. Do your back of the envelope, <br>
it's really revealing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; sibility of hyper-exponential development, but my original context was</i><br>
<i>&gt; sex changes within the context of nanotech designer life.  I agree there</i><br>
<p>
I presume we are talking about uploads, which has excellent chances to be <br>
the only life in existance. Having physical bodies appears to me as an <br>
anachronism, a waste of resource. You are sure you are able to protect <br>
your physical system if the ground you tread on will be disassembled to <br>
become a part of the Dysonian orbiting computer cluster?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; may be fundamental barriers, but I see these as being much further out</i><br>
<i>&gt; than anything involved in simply getting to nanotech and designer life.</i><br>
<p>
Drexlerian molecular manufacturing by mechanosynthetic means can be <br>
classified as speculative engineering. Not lunatic fringe, no, yet firmly <br>
speculative.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see no reason at all why early trans-human intelligences should press</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limits of physics anymore than the human brain itself does.</i><br>
<p>
The human is an instance of a naturally evolved nanosystem. Do not sneer <br>
at these, since such systems use molecules and cluster of molecules for <br>
building blocks. You  can improve them, but not by awful lot. E.g. a human <br>
processing eqivalent may occupy a volume range from a sugar cube to an <br>
orange, while requiring drastically more power to run than its biological <br>
counterpart. While speedup factors of up to 1k might be realistic (I <br>
haven't estimated this too exactly yet), factors of 1 M and more are <br>
definitely not.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; It's not at all clear to me that developing nanotech even requires </i><br>
<i>&gt; trans-human intelligence, and even if it does, I'm not at all con-</i><br>
<p>
It requires a lot of R&amp;D G$$'s, several decades, a number of <br>
breakthroughs. What is transhuman? In 20-30 yrs, resources commanded by a <br>
human, genetically identical to us will be quite formidable. On the <br>
whole, a number of such individuals will command mindboggling powers. It <br>
will be fun.<br>
<p>
The trouble with (Drexlerian) nanotech: we don't know whether it is <br>
feasible. Bootstrapping will be terribly hard, like stirring a cup of <br>
cofee with a tree stump. Other, weaker brands of nanotech are possible, <br>
but these are not very suitable for all-purpose molecular manufacturing.<br>
(Sufficient for molecular circuitry, though, of the orange-sized human <br>
equivalent, about realtime or 10-100x speedup).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; vinced that the difficulties of getting to trans-human intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; are as you present them.  I mean if the development of trans-human </i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence really is going to take:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; truly impressive hardware, which will need oodles of cash and manpower </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for R&amp;D,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then maybe we should consider turning the job over from the computer </i><br>
<i>&gt; science field to the gene splicers and the pharmaceutical industry; at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least there, the starting platform is already one of "human intelligence".</i><br>
<p>
I was assuming de novo protein design for structural matrix, de novo <br>
enzymes, scaffolding, autoassembly, etc. Clearly silicon tech is dead on <br>
the 20-30 decade range. They might migrate to molecular circuitry via the <br>
Langmuir-Blodgett route, but I honestly don't think that is likely. It's <br>
time to start afresh, substrate change being mandatory as we move up one <br>
more dimension (2d-&gt;3d) and collapse structure size by one or two orders <br>
of magnitude (can't say too much about power demands and switching speeds <br>
yet).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; All in all, it seems like the greatest problems are not knowledge, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; those amorphous things we call politics, wisdom, morality, motivation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and human behavior in general (not to mention trans-human behavior).</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. Labs, lots of bright researchers, cash, time. A coordinated <br>
world-wide programme to dwarf HUGO &amp; Co. Do we have the resources? Do we <br>
have the motivation? Even more importantly, do we have the time? There <br>
are also a number of different, less pleasant developmental <br>
discontinuities predicted for 2030, or so. Considering, how monumentally <br>
stupid or species behaves on the large scale, I do not think them that <br>
unlikely. We only move our ass when we feel the heat. This time, we <br>
shouldn't make a mistake. We won't get a second chance.<br>
