&lt;&lt; <br>
 The whole point of this post was to try to get a grip on the mechanism <br>
 of creativity, not to offend artists.  I'll do some more thinking<br>
 and post more on it later.<br>

Hi<br>
It was not offensive to this artist, in fact it has made me think! Re:<br>
evidence of artists being more insane,  I will try to find some  statistics<br>
about incidences of insanity by careers (if any exists) and get back to you(<br>
my personal bet would be that psychiatrists are the most suseptible-JUST<br>
KIDDING).<br>
Meantime, i am spurred to once again look at the role emotions ( another<br>
artifact?) and analogy/metaphor plays in the cognitive/creative part of<br>
mind....<br>
