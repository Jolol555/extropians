I think far too many people pretend beliefs they do not have in order to <br>
fit in. The worst thing isn't the hypocricy (quite often it is necessary <br>
in order to remain in the group) but the fact that make believe beliefs <br>
tend to rub off. We tend to start to believe in what we say, regardless <br>
of what we say.<br>
<p>
How to deal with this? Being more open about what we think will cause <br>
more friction, and in some cases might even be counterproductive, but in <br>
the long run I think it is healthier to decrease the dissonance between <br>
what we really think and what we say we think. It also promotes others to <br>
be more open, if they know you can tolerate their divergent opinions. <br>
