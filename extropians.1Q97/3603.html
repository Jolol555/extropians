<i>&gt;  Strauss &amp; Howe's theories can clearly be tested against statistics</i><br>
<i>&gt; as quantifiable as that. For example, opinion polls that measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; how protective U.S. adults feel about children should, if Strauss &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Howe are correct, show an increase in protective attitudes over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1982-2003 period and a decrease from about 2030 to 2050.</i><br>
<p>
If they have done such research--and to be statistically valid,<br>
announced publicly the research they intended to do before they<br>
actually did it--then putting those numbers somewhere on their<br>
Web site can only strengthen their theories, and they have no<br>
reason no to do so.  That's what Web sites are for--there are<br>
no constraints on book size, audience level, marketing needs.<br>
Since only those who go looking will find it, there's no reason<br>
not to put up /everything/ that might help your case.<br>
<p>
Their web site contains not one piece of verifiable information.<br>
If they want to put it there, I'll go back and look at it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Note that the statistic you have adopted is so weak that creationism</i><br>
<i>&gt; passes easily - any of those million species can be explained by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; assertion that god designed them that way. (If you think evolution has</i><br>
<i>&gt; provided anything more than a post-hoc rationalization of how those</i><br>
<i>&gt; million species came to be, show me).</i><br>
<p>
Freshly-constructed algorithms, with absolutely no programmed goals<br>
other than existence, based on the underlying mechanisms of duplication,<br>
mutation, and selection that we can observe today, exhibit the<br>
phenomenon of adaptation in quite remarkable and unexpected ways.<br>
This is not post-hoc, since the phenomenon emerged from something that<br>
was not programmed to produce it, and the few simple instructions the<br>
programs were given are directly obsevable, not postulated.  It is a<br>
waste of my time to repeat the whole case against the absolute idiocy<br>
of creationism; Dawkins _Blind Watchmaker_ and a dozen other sources<br>
do that quite competently.  But I point this out to specifically<br>
counter the question you asked.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;your social theories to that test: if you postulate that some age</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;was "the age of heroes" or some such nonsense, show me that /everyone/</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on the planet at that time fit some definable profile.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'll do that after you show that all of those millions of species</i><br>
<i>&gt; are perfectly adapted to their environment. See how easy it is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; attack straw men?</i><br>
<p>
You mistinterpret my claim.  To be precise, it is (1) Evolution is<br>
quantitative, testable, and falsifiable.  (2) Not one single fossil<br>
falsifies it.  I did not claim that (3) every fossil /confirms/ it, <br>
or (4) that we understand how every feature of every species came<br>
about.  Nor do I, or does evolution, claim that (5) every feature of<br>
every species is an adaptation.  That's nonsense; any engineer knows<br>
that mamy features of even the most carefully designed systems are<br>
historical accidents.<br>
<p>
Creationism, as you correctly point out, passes test (2), but then<br>
so does every other theory.  That's why you need to add (1) for a<br>
theory to be meaningful, otherwise it's not even a valid hypothesis.<br>
You can attack (3) through (5) all you like.<br>
