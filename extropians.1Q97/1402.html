Joy Williams wonders, "Just *what* is it that is having the experiences of all <br>
the processes?  Something is experiencing that, right?".<br>
<p>
It is a common belief that there is something or someone *having* experiences. <br>
 This belief is what gives rise to the ideas of "souls".  Our culture teaches <br>
us to believe that we are separate from our experiences, that we are <br>
individuals *having* experiences.  This is the main duality our culture <br>
embraces, the split between mind and body, between the experiencer and the <br>
experiences.<br>
<p>
When I consider this duality, I see how deeply ingrained it is in our way of <br>
looking at the world and in our habits of speech.  I also see how blatently <br>
flawed the duality is.  To me, it seems obvious that there is no such duality, <br>
but I do not know how to explain it convincingly.<br>
<p>
There is no one experiencing anything; there are only experiences themselves.  <br>
Consciousness is an *experience*; our experience of selfhood is an <br>
*experience*.  We *are* our experiences; we are not something *separate* from <br>
them.<br>
<p>
Do you want to know what you are?  Behold yourself!  That's what you are.  You <br>
are this.  This Very Experience.  You are right here, in all the details of <br>
this very moment.  Every feeling, every sensation, every thought, every memory <br>
or impression; that is *you*!  The *awareness* of the world, of other people, <br>
of plants and animals and everything; that *awareness* is you.  Everything you <br>
encounter is within you, for you to even be aware of it.  The moving colors <br>
and sounds may come from an outside source (an objective world), but the <br>
sensations themselves become an intergral part of you as soon as you are aware <br>
of them.  You *are* that awareness; you *are* that sensation.  If it's <br>
experienced, then it is already part of you; for you *are* that experience.<br>
<p>
I know, I'm being redundant and repetitive and saying the same thing over and <br>
over again; I'm just hoping that if I say it enough, in enough different ways, <br>
it will sink in.  It's such an obvious point, and so simple to see, once you <br>
fully realize it.  It's *amazing* how many people don't notice the obvious, <br>
though.  The *self* is this current moment of experience, the shifting <br>
patterns of thought and sensation, of memory and emotion.  Some patterns <br>
change quickly, and others change slowly, but nothing is permanent.  <br>
<p>
We are ephemeral, transient patterns, rising from other patterns and flowing <br>
on to become something else.  From moment to moment, experiencing the reality <br>
that we are.  We are this; This Very Moment.<br>
