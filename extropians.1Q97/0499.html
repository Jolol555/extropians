<p>
The problem, from my understanding, with using H2S is that it is an<br>
energy storeage device, while water is an energy sink. If you liken a<br>
living organism to an electronic circuit, you want your chemical<br>
reactions to give up energy, producing waste that is at a "grounded"<br>
state.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
True, but you are assuming they would need the same resources. if they<br>
are that different, they would develop much differently technologically,<br>
especially on a chemistry basis. We may even develop some sort of<br>
symbiosis if our waste products are their resources and vice versa. Take<br>
the H2S/H2O issue. Or take our relationship to plants.<br>

<i>&gt; I don't agree with your assumption of two eyes and ears.  In most organisms,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number of sensors is a tradeoff between necessity, capability, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; processing power.  There is no requirement for a minimum number of</i><br>

<i>&gt; having more increases your auditory capabilities significantly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technically, you could detect and process surround sound with a single ear.</i><br>
<p>
While I agree with you for most organisms, I was applying the argument<br>
toward intelligent life. As we see with cetaceans with their incredible<br>
auditory processing, able to 3d image an entire ocean in a few chirps,<br>
they may have high brain to body mass ratios, but much of that brain<br>
mass is wasted on signal processing. An intelligent creature will evolve<br>
with the optimum mix of number of units vs processing requirements, as<br>
it needs to use its brain for higher thinking, or to put it the other<br>
way around, if it does evolve with an optimum mix, then it will have<br>
that much greater evolutionary advantage toward developing intelligence.<br>
