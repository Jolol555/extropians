DM&gt; I understand what you mean, but consider: to *communicate* a message,<br>
DM&gt; the minds you wish to communicate with must be receptive to what you<br>
DM&gt; have to say.  If they're not open to what you are saying, then you will<br>
DM&gt; end up *saying* your "message", but it has no real effect, because it<br>
DM&gt; is not transfered to another mind; so it is not really a message after<br>
DM&gt; all, since there is no communication going on.<br>
<p>
Point taken.  I still see value in plain, honest, expression even in<br>
those cases where it may provoke an angry response, though, for<br>
several reasons:<br>
<p>
- Trying to second-guess someone else's emotional response is often<br>
  impossible, and insulting to their mind.  They are just as capable<br>
  of reason as you are.  They may have a different set of prejudices<br>
  and delusions and beliefs through which they filter ideas, but you<br>
  cannot know every possible reaction of everyone you talk to.  You<br>
  can know, though, that they are all human, and capable of reason if<br>
  they choose to use it--so speak to them plainly, with reason. <br>
  Their reaction is their responsibility, not yours.<br>
<p>
- Trying to communicate with someone "from their point of view" <br>
  implicitly validates that point of view.  If their views or their<br>
  epistemology are irrational, they can just as easily wiggle their<br>
  way out of your idea with their own methods, or they accept your<br>
  result, they may use your words to validate their own ideas.<br>
<p>
  I once argued with a man about flag-burning.  Knowing that he was<br>
  a Christian, I argued that God made the second commandment "Thou<br>
  shalt not make unto me any graven image" because he knew that people<br>
  often lose sight of reality when they worship symbols, and he<br>
  wanted to make sure the people worshipped /him/, not an image of him.<br>
  I should have known better--he just dredged up scripture to support<br>
  his point of view (the Bible is great for that) and pressed on.  So<br>
  I lost the point, and I validated his theism.  Even if he had taken<br>
  my argument to heart, I may have won his vote on one small issue,<br>
  but I still validated the idea that God is a proper way to argue.<br>
  Thereby winning a small battle by conceding the war.<br>
<p>
- Sometimes the angry response is evidence that they /did/ understand<br>
  the point, and are uncomfortable with its consequences.  Such reactions<br>
  may well lead your listener to examine why his beliefs conflict with<br>
  your ideas, and to find a way to resolve them.  Of course, he might<br>
  resolve them with further irrational nonsense instead of reason.  In <br>
  that case, he is likely to run into further conflicts, and have more<br>
  opportunities to see reason--and to see difference between his life<br>
  of conflict and the lives of men of reason.  Even when you cannot get<br>
  your point across, you are still an example.<br>
<p>
So I stand by my premise: the only job of a speaker is to be honest,<br>
clear, and understandable--by his own standards.  The emotional reaction<br>
of the listener is the listener's responsibility to deal with.<br>
