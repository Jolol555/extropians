This really will be my last comment on this thread, and then I would <br>
indeed also be interested in exploring the nature of genius further.  <br>
(Suggested topic:  can we evolve new forms of genius?)<br>

Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i>&gt;I would go so far as to say that any exceptions to the rule that are out</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are not likely to be true in fact, but only true in the minds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the politically motivated soft scientists who study them, and promote</i><br>
<i>&gt;them for propagnada purposes.</i><br>
<p>
You are about to read a very rare personal opinion from me, as <br>
follows (with only one statistic!):<br>
<p>
I've been transhumanist all of my life (even tho I didn't know the <br>
word for it at an early age), and I have never been able to <br>
understand how anyone who is interested in transhumanism could <br>
possibly express any interest in any paradigm that de facto renders <br>
52% of the human population as something lesser than the other half.  <br>
<p>
I'm interested in finding ways to help people understand the barriers <br>
that they live under and how to overcome them.  If the hard sciences <br>
were addressing that, I would happily utilize their material, but <br>
historically the focus has been on finding hard evidence to <br>
perpetuate existing power structures.<br>
<p>
In the past few years, people have seen fit to slap the label <br>
"political correctness" on this quest for equality and growth, and <br>
that has been used as a tool to silence voices.  Well, it won't <br>
silence mine.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
