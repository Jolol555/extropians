I hate to sound like an ad, but there's a new antioxidant<br>
formula available with antioxidants previously unavailable<br>
in the U.S. -- hence the definition "new."<br>
<p>
The patented formula, called ACF-223, contains: <br>
<p>
   NDGA (nordihydroguairetic acid) <br>
   MEA (2-Mercaptoethylamine)<br>
   BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene)<br>
<p>
NDGA is an extremely powerful antioxidant found in a <br>
species of life-form with a member that is the oldest <br>
known living entity on earth: the chapparel herb. Native<br>
Americans were aware of its healthful properties and used <br>
it to treat cancer [1]. It appears that NDGA inhibits the <br>
respiration of tumor cells [2]. A plant containing NDGA <br>
(I assume chapparel) was always the first to reappear in <br>
nuclear-bomb-test-blast zones in the southwest, and studies<br>
showed that NDGA was the reason that this plant could <br>
survive and that animals that eat it also had a higher<br>
incidence of surviving the severe-radiation exposure [3], <br>
which is a form of free-radical damage. I've also read, <br>
but alas cannot now find the book, that NDGA also inhibits<br>
the respiration of various pathogens such as viri and/ <br>
or bacteria, but minus the reference you'll just have <br>
to rely on Goddardian memory for this detail -- hope<br>
that Ginko is working.<br>
<p>
MEA increased the life-span of laboratory animals by <br>
30% [4], and is specifically powerful in quenching <br>
iron-based free radicals. Some experts believe that <br>
iron-based free-radical damage is more causally <br>
correlated to heart attacks that high cholesterol, <br>
high blood pressure, or diabetes [4]. <br>
<p>
BHT is fairly well-know to life extensionists. As <br>
I understand research continues to come out showing <br>
favorable outcomes. My only concern with this agent <br>
is that it is correlated with the induction of higher<br>
level of liver enzymes, which can signal liver damage,<br>
but I'm not aware of any evidence that liver damage is<br>
associated with BHT, and I'm aware of a lot of promising<br>
effects. For more on BHT and possible risks consult Durk <br>
Pearson and Sandy Shaw's classic: LIFE EXTENSION.<br>
<p>
Anyway -- and here's where I cannot avoid sounding <br>
like an ad (and I'm not making any money off this,<br>
though I wish I were!!) -- you can get this patented <br>
anti-ox formula ACF-223 only via GERO-VITAL: 1-800-694-8366<br>
