There is a lot of confusion of terms in this "Meaning of Life"<br>
thread, but there is also some interesting thought in it, so I<br>
think it's worth trying to nail down a little.<br>
<p>
One source of confusion: Design vs. Use.  Complex systems, whether<br>
designed by human intention or evolution (not necessarily assuming<br>
yet that they are distinct), are designed for a "purpose" in the<br>
sense that there is a use or set of uses that caused them to come<br>
into being (or remain alive, in the case of evolution).  A human<br>
designer created a wrench for the purpose of turning bolts.  Humans<br>
and other life forms alive today are alive because the effects our<br>
genes had on the world caused them to replicate those genes more<br>
successfully than others, so one can speak of the genes having<br>
"designed" us for replicating them.<br>
<p>
But once designed, a thing is what it is, not what it was "meant"<br>
to be.  The designer's job is done, and the user can now choose to<br>
respect or ignore the design.  A wrench is rigid and heavy because<br>
that makes it better at its designed function of turning bolts, but<br>
those features also make it well-suiting to cracking walnuts.<br>
<p>
Congnitive and computational sytems are no different: assembly<br>
language programmers know the trick of using a subroutine-return<br>
instruction to implement a jump table by pushing an address from<br>
the table on the stack and executing the return.  The instruction<br>
was "designed" for returning from subroutines, but having been<br>
desigined, it now does what it does, not only what it was meant<br>
to do, so there is no reason not to use it for making jump tables.<br>
<p>
Studying evolutionary biology is useful in understanding what the<br>
brain does by using its design to guide our research; but it would<br>
be as foolish to constrain our actions by that design as it would<br>
be to let walnuts rot when there's a perfectly good wrench around.<br>
<p>
This causes confusion because the question "What's our purpose?"<br>
means at least two completely different things: one is "For what<br>
purpose or purposes were we designed?".  Another is "Given the<br>
results of that design (i.e., our abilities and the state of the<br>
world as it exists today), what purpose or purposes would it be<br>
most rational for me to pursue?"<br>
<p>
I think evolution answers this first question adequately, until<br>
some competing theory betters it.  But I also think it is of small<br>
use in answering the second.  It may suggest what processes will<br>
shape the future in which we act, and it helps us understand our<br>
abilities, but it offers no guidance for our choice of goals.<br>
<p>
I think, for example, that Eli is confusing "personal values"<br>
with those things we are /designed/ to value, such as reproduction.<br>
Given that definition, he is right to treat it as something that<br>
is not necessarily a /useful/ value in the teleological sense.<br>
What he calls "intrinsic" values are those values that can be<br>
rationally shown to support his given goal (that goal itself may<br>
or may not be rationally derivable).<br>
<p>
I think what Eric means by the assertion that values are personal<br>
is something else.  Namely, that given a goal, actions and the<br>
products of those actions can be rationally shown to support that<br>
gaol to varying degrees based on how well they use resources to<br>
support the goal.  But each individual has different resources,<br>
different capabilities.  Even if the goal is agreed upon, different<br>
people will have different values that support that goal: if the<br>
goal, for example, is wealth, then I would quite rationally value<br>
my legs less than, say, Jerry Rice, because I am a programmer.  If<br>
I came to work tomorrow in a wheelchair, my ability to earn wealth<br>
would be affected little.  If Jerry Rice did, his income would be<br>
affected drastically.  It is also the case that people differ in<br>
their ability to reason and choose goals, but that is not necessary<br>
to make values personal.  It still might be that there is a single<br>
rational goal for humans to pursue, and therefore a single rational<br>
"intrinsic" value system for each individual to have in support of<br>
that goal, but its intrinsic nature makes it no less personal.<br>
