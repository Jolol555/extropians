<i>&gt;Perhaps the most expedient way to do that is with a personal web page?</i><br>
<i>&gt;After all, it is not the physical appearance of the brain that one is</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested in, and if it were, that's easy to fake.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you for understanding my core point, and what a wonderful <br>
transhumanist suggestion!  You could add interaction on e-lists as <br>
another way to use one's brain to attract people--plenty of sexy minds <br>
on this one!  <br>
<p>
I also agree with your comments on clothing, although for slightly <br>
different reasons.  Clothing conveys information to other persons, <br>
but it can also become a part of the physical experience, with the use <br>
of different textures and shapes and colors.  We indulge our tactile <br>
and artistic senses through choice of fabric and style, and show <br>
others our individuality.  It is the easiest (and least messy) method <br>
of altering our physical structures for business or pleasure modes.<br>
<p>
Combining a sense of physical style with a roving intelligence <br>
produces a forward aesthetic and a truly magnetic combination <br>
to lure potential lovers.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
