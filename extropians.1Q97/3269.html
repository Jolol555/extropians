The same dilemma has been adressed nicely in John Brunner's "Shockwave <br>
Rider", where they had any number of misshapen failures in their quest <br>
for the "Ubermensch. Brunner seems to be strongly contra cloning, btw.<br>

If we are to keep severely retarded or semianencephalic self clones for <br>
blood donoring or organ transplant purposes, the shotgun approach of <br>
current recombinant DNA technology will have some grave problems. Anybody <br>
care for a selfburger?<br>

We've surely set up a worm farm if we consider transgenetic animals as <br>
ersatz wombs for human breeding.<br>
