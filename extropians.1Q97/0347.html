In a message dated 97-01-07 00:01:19 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 I am proposing Anarchy because History has shown that limited government<br>
does<br>
 not stay limited for long. It seems to be in the fundamental nature of a<br>
state<br>
 to increase it's power. By definition a state has power an individual or<br>
 corporation does not have, it's inevitable that it will use that power,<br>
 however small it starts out to be, to gain even more power, the process<br>
 increases exponentially until people revolt. The lesson from history is<br>
clear,<br>
 the only solution is to eliminate governments completely.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Thank you for the clarification. I agree with you on many things, but seek<br>
answers on issues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of communicating your wishes, there are</i><br>
much better ways. Every day I send hundreds of exquisitely precise messages<br>
to the Free Market telling it what I want it to do. I also get to compare<br>
brands, I can't do that In a democracy because I'm not voting for goods or<br>
services or even policies, I just get to choose between two grab bags of<br>
promises every 4 years, and democracy is the best form of government,<br>
the best of a bad lot.<br>
<i> &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I still dont see how buying certain brand names can settle issues like<br>
violent crime, child molestation, addictions, vixtim mentalities, drug<br>
addiction, invading armies, disasters, etc...<br>
