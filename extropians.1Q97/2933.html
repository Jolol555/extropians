<i>&gt; He never claimed that anyone believes the marketplace can solve </i><br>
<i>&gt; all problems, nor even that they believe that it can solve even one </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the problems you use as an example, nor even that inequity is </i><br>
<i>&gt; a problem except when taken to extremes.  In your attempt to show </i><br>
<i>&gt; that the quoted author had presented a straw man fallacy, you </i><br>
<i>&gt; presented a textbook example yourself.</i><br>
<p>
He claims precisely that; he just doesn't have the balls to say it<br>
in plain English, but leaves it as the implication of evasive rhetoric<br>
that would make a spin doctor proud.  If he means something different,<br>
I can't fathom it.  Perhaps I am seeing meanings that aren't there,<br>
or I am over-reaching because of the insidiously evil ideas he then<br>
spouts, but I think not.  I think he really means to imply exactly what<br>
I think he implies, and his words are meant to attack that implication<br>
because he can't attack the facts.<br>
<p>
Yes, I do get emotional about this particular subject, because this<br>
man, others like him, and his ideas are the most serious danger to my<br>
life and liberty imaginable.  He is a liar, a coward, a rich hypocrite<br>
who wants to keep others from having the success he has achieved by<br>
manipulating the collectivist government to use its guns to keep them<br>
down now that he's got his.  I would not allow this man into my house,<br>
or sit at a table with him.  Reading his words fills me with moral<br>
revulsion.  Is that emotional enough?<br>
<p>
I try to maintain some semblance of reason under these conditions, but<br>
I'm not perfect.<br>
