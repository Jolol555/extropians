With the recent thread about patents here, I thought many of you would <br>
find this story from the San Jose Mercury News timely and interesting.<br>

ATM network company corners 'Internet'<br>
<p>
Published: March 20, 1997<br>

<p>
There's another new problem with the Internet.<br>
<p>
Somebody owns the name.<br>
<p>
Internet Inc., of Reston, Va., is in the midst of a two-year battle to <br>
protect<br>
its corporate trademark. The company, founded in 1984, has little if <br>
anything to<br>
do with personal computers, e-mail or surfing for information. It runs a <br>
network<br>
of automated teller machines and, in January, merged with another ATM <br>
network to<br>
become Honor Technologies Inc.<br>
<p>
But seven years ago, Internet Inc. registered ``Internet'' as a trademark <br>
with<br>
the federal government, not knowing that the global computer network <br>
popularly<br>
known by the same moniker would become so widely used. The company, <br>
however,<br>
still wants the exclusive right to use and license the Internet name.<br>
<p>
``It's now a valuable mark,'' said Edward Kondracki, an attorney with <br>
Kerkam,<br>
Stowell, Kondracki &amp; Clarke in Falls Church, Va., which represents <br>
Internet Inc.<br>
``Events have happened since then that increased the value.''<br>
<p>
One of the results of the fight by Internet Inc., whose right to the mark <br>
has<br>
been challenged by a society made up of many of the technological <br>
founders of the<br>
Internet, is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has delayed the <br>
petitions<br>
of hundreds of companies seeking to use the word ``Internet'' to <br>
trademark their<br>
goods or services.<br>
<p>
Companies requesting trademarks in the burgeoning Internet field are <br>
being told<br>
by Washington they will face delays unless they use a more generic term, <br>
such as<br>
``global communications network.''<br>
<p>
``In trademark-office parlance, `Internet' is like one of George Carlin's <br>
seven<br>
dirty words: It cannot be spoken,'' said Sally Abel, an attorney with <br>
Fenwick &amp;<br>
West in Palo Alto, who estimates that 90 percent of her clients have been<br>
affected by the trademark case.<br>
<p>
A trademark is a distinctive phrase, word, logo, or symbol that <br>
distinguishes one<br>
manufacturer's product from another's -- for example, Ford cars, <br>
McDonald's<br>
hamburgers, IBM computers.<br>
<p>
Trademarks can be awarded in scores of different categories. For example, <br>
Apple<br>
Computer is a trademark and it co-exists with Apple Corp., the Beatles' <br>
trademark<br>
record label. But the trademark allows Apple Computer to prevent another<br>
computer-related company from using the name.<br>
<p>
Sometimes, however, trademarks can be lost when a term becomes considered<br>
``generic'' -- for example, Bayer Corp. lost its trademark for the name <br>
aspirin.<br>
<p>
Internet Inc. was awarded trademark protections in categories that include<br>
communications services, providing electronic data transmission services, <br>
and<br>
electronic banking and retail marketing.<br>
<p>
Some of Abel's clients in techno-savvy Silicon Valley have been confused <br>
when<br>
asked to change business or product names. ``They say, `What do you mean <br>
global<br>
communications network?' '' Abel said. ` ``Aren't we talking about the <br>
Internet?'<br>
''<br>
<p>
No one is sure how much longer the growing number of Internet cases will <br>
be<br>
delayed. The trademark office's administrative trial and appeal board has <br>
been<br>
reviewing the case of the Internet Society and Corporation for National <br>
Research<br>
Initiatives vs. Internet Inc. since it was filed in October 1994. Federal<br>
officials say the importance of the case -- nearly 1,000 petitions <br>
requesting<br>
marks involving the term Internet have been received to date -- has <br>
contributed<br>
to the delay.<br>
<p>
``It's a monumental case,'' said Lisa-Joy Zgorski, press secretary for <br>
the U.S.<br>
Patent and Trademark Office. ``It will have tremendous implications in <br>
how we<br>
handle relevant trademarks.''<br>
<p>
The Internet Society, a non-governmental organization for global <br>
cooperation for<br>
the Internet, had tried to register its own trademark of the name <br>
starting in<br>
1989. But those requests were denied, citing the Internet Inc. trademark. <br>
Now,<br>
the society is arguing that the term ``Internet'' is generic and so <br>
widely used<br>
-- like aspirin, escalator and cellophane -- that it shouldn't be owned by<br>
anyone.<br>
<p>
``It's like car or telephone or television,'' said Patrice Lyons, the <br>
Washington,<br>
D.C.-based attorney for the Internet Society. ``There are certain terms <br>
like that<br>
that are generally accepted to be descriptive of a particular thing. They<br>
shouldn't be subject to trademark restrictions. Internet is merely a <br>
descriptive<br>
term for the well-known network of networks.''<br>
<p>
Lyons said the categories for which Internet Inc. was awarded trademark <br>
status<br>
are too broad because they cover a big share of Internet-related <br>
businesses and<br>
their products.<br>
<p>
In technological circles, no company wants a product to be considered <br>
generic. In<br>
the early 1990s, Intel Corp. was stripped of trademark protections for <br>
its 386<br>
microprocessor chip, after competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc. proved <br>
the term<br>
was generic. When Intel tried to protect other chips in the series -- the <br>
486,<br>
586, 686, etc. -- AMD and Compaq Computer Corp. opposed the petitions. <br>
Intel<br>
switched to the product name Pentium but has since been embroiled in a <br>
similar<br>
dispute over the rights to the MMX name, which competitors say is generic <br>
for<br>
``multimedia extensions.''<br>
<p>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued 1 million trademarks to <br>
date.<br>
Last year, the office examined 200,000 applications for trademarks, <br>
Zgorski said,<br>
among those nearly 1,000 that requested trademarks using the term <br>
``Internet.''<br>
<p>
The Internet is having a notable affect on trademark law in other ways, <br>
too,<br>
because it cuts across national boundaries.<br>
<p>
``It's an international Yellow Pages,'' said Stephen Elias, author of <br>
``Patent,<br>
Copyright &amp; Trademark,'' published by Berkeley's Nolo Press. ``It used to <br>
be that<br>
your decision about what marks to use, where to register them, where to <br>
search<br>
for existing marks, could all be done on a local basis. If you were <br>
registering<br>
Pete's Barber Shop or Barking Dog Coffee Roasters, there were likely no <br>
other<br>
businesses by that name in your town.''<br>
<p>
These days, a company in San Jose with a presence on the Internet might <br>
have to<br>
check trademark registrations in Italy or Australia or Japan before <br>
deciding upon<br>
a company or product name, Elias said.<br>
<p>
The question remains whether ``Internet'' is too widely used to be <br>
protected in a<br>
trademark.<br>
<p>
``We advise clients that putting `Internet' in your name is like putting <br>
the word<br>
`The' in your name,'' said Palo Alto attorney Mark Radcliffe, of Gray <br>
Cary Ware &amp;<br>
Freidenrich. ``Internet is not protected for something related to the <br>
Internet,<br>
just as using PC is not protected in the personal-computer market.''<br>
