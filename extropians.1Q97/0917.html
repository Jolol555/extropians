Dear transhuman friends,<br>
<p>
	I am launching the Extropic Art Manifesto.  Many of you have already signed<br>
the Manifesto and I thank you for your support and encouragement. I invite<br>
those who have not yet read it to participate. The Extropic Art Manifesto<br>
is now being signed by artists and scientists alike. Artists such as Merlin<br>
(Stellarc Australia) and scientists such as Bart Kosko and Roy Walford have<br>
already signed. By adding your names to this Manifesto you can help drive<br>
home the realization that the future of our art, our creativity and<br>
imagination, is most clearly understood in terms of extropic thinking.=20<br>
<p>
	As many of you know, I have been an ardent activist of Transhumanist Art<br>
for many years. As my own vision of the future has crystalized, so has my<br>
aesthetic sensibility towards Transhumanist Art. I explained in the<br>
Transhumanist Art Statement (<a href="http://www.primenet.com/~flexeon/transart">http://www.primenet.com/~flexeon/transart</a>) the<br>
relationship between Transhumanist Art and Extropic Art: "They are like<br>
slightly different reflections of the same thing=97Extropic Art being more=<br>
 in<br>
focus. Extropic Art is an outgrowth of Transhumanist Art. Where<br>
Transhumanist Art represents the aesthetic culture of transhumanity,<br>
Extropic Art emphasizes the actualization of the aesthetic culture. Its<br>
goals are very focused, developed and refined, inspired by my own ideas<br>
along with the Extropian philosophy."<br>
<p>
	If you have not done so already, please send me your name as a participant<br>
as soon as possible. Your participation will help. The more people who sign<br>
it, the more effective the Manifesto will be in spreading our shared ideas<br>
to new communities. Along with your e-mail address, I welcome you to send a<br>
URL to link to the Manifesto examples of your extropically artistic=<br>
 activities.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>

                                EXTROPIC ART MANIFESTO<br>
<p>
                                We are transhumans.<br>
<p>
                        Our art integrates the most eminent progression=20<br>
                                of creativity and rationality<br>
                                merged by  discovery.=20<br>
<p>
<p>
I am the architect of my existence. My art reflects my vision and represents<br>
my values. It conveys the very essence of my being=97coalescing imagination<br>
and reason, challenging all limits.<br>
<p>
                                * * * * *<br>
Extropic Art calls upon our heightened sensibility to reveal the<br>
multiplicity of realms yet to be discovered, yet to be realized. We are<br>
exploring how current and future technologies affect our senses, our<br>
cognition and our lives. Our attention to and comprehension of these<br>
relationship become fields of art as we participate in the most immediate<br>
and vital issues for transhumanity: expanding life and reversing aging,<br>
self-ownership and liberty, augmenting intelligence and creativity,<br>
exploring the universe.<br>
<p>
                                * * * * *<br>
Extropic Artists design with electronics and collaborate with the cosmos,<br>
perform in multiple realities, automorph mind and body, conceive, innovate<br>
and explore. We indelibly engrave extropic memes. We are the<br>
neo-cyberneticists utilizing high-end creativity, engineering skills,<br>
scientific data, and automated tools to author our visions.<br>
<p>
                                * * * * *<br>
Extropic Art encourages experimentation and attitudes of abundance. Extropic<br>
Art emphasizes the infinite possibilities of self-transformation as we seek<br>
new values indispensable to our self-creation. We have no interest in<br>
focusing on self-defeating thinking or entropy. We are achieving refined<br>
emotions through provocative forward thinking and analytical techniques.=20<br>
<p>
                                * * * * *<br>
The Extropic Art Movement and its subsets Exoterra and Automorph Art ,<br>
regard art as more than an artefact. Art influences social and cultural<br>
change: how we live and who we are. It creates a sense of self, art as<br>
being, autonomous yet connected to culture=92s continuum. How we accomplish<br>
our intentions is a matter of selective individual choice=97whether abstract<br>
or concrete, whether artefact or non-form. Our criteria for art remain open<br>
and we welcome cross-disciplinary innovations.=20<br>
<p>
                                * * * * *<br>
As we move into the 21st Century, Extropic Art will suffuse the universe<br>
around us. Our unique ingenuity will spread far out into the capillaries of<br>
our culture. We are active participants in our own evolution from human to<br>
posthuman. We are shaping the image of whom we are becoming.<br>
