<p>
Please explain then our complete lack of emotive education in our<br>
schools. I believe Greg Burch explained quite lucidly why emotive<br>
education has failed in the past, but I believe he also made it clear<br>
that such may very well be feasible today. <br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Gregory thinks that subjective reality can be studied objectively and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this has not been tried before.</i><br>
<p>
Yes on the former, and on the latter, it has not been tried before in<br>
the sense that I am seeking. It has not been attempted in the rigorous,<br>
scientific, somewhat standardized fashion, necessary for it to be found<br>
beneficial in our current educational settings. No one that I am aware<br>
of has developed an evolving curriculum of emotive education that would<br>
be suitable and beneficial in our current educational settings. This<br>
will first require the development of basic skills and exercises for<br>
observing and measuring emotive events. Just as in purely objective<br>
science we require standardized methods of observation and measurement,<br>
we will require the same in order to apply the scientific method to<br>
emotive science. We will require the same to help objectify what is<br>
intrinsically subjective. These rudimentry skills and exercises should<br>
be simple enough that a kindergarten student could begin developing them<br>
so that in each consecutive grade those skills could be built upon. And<br>
from the get go, there should be an emphasis on how these new skills can<br>
be applied to effectively augment the students cognitive skills.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of his examples are yogic</i><br>
<i>&gt; feats of self-control or idiot-savant abberations.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, very few people currently have either the discipline or the<br>
biological anomoly to manifest these skills. Very few people. Perhaps it<br>
is not all laziness. What I am proposing IS something new, something<br>
that as Greg Burch clarified so well, may only now be feasible. And that<br>
is to introduce emotive education in a non-esoteric, non-religious,<br>
non-mystical fashion. It is to assimilate emotive education into our<br>
current cognitive educations. This may take some time, but it is my<br>
intention to develop an emotive curriculum for primary and secondary<br>
educational institutions. In the same fashion we can begin preparing for<br>
calculus at a very early age by learning arithmatic, we can prepare for<br>
advanced levels of emotive intelligence at a young age by learning the<br>
fundamentals of emotive education.  <br>
<p>
I will not tout emotive education as an absolute requirement. Emotive<br>
education will be offered specifically for the careful consideration of<br>
private educational institutions. However, I imagine that its<br>
overwhelming competitive benefits, may economically neccesitate its<br>
future adoption in most if not all schools, and thus we may find it<br>
becomes as ubiquitous to our schooling as mathmatics is today.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The point of the above discussion, of some fascinating techniques that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm nevertheless very skeptical of, is that even these advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; shamanic disciplines do not try to create some false dichotomy between</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 'inner world' and the 'outer world'.  You can lose yourself in</i><br>
<i>&gt; solipsism like Poul Anderson's Teramind, or you can engage the</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective reality in a biotechnical way.</i><br>
<p>
I have only stressed the dichotomy because as I see it now, that is how<br>
it is most often percieved. Our society has a very strong bias towards<br>
the 'outer world'. Our primary and secondary education is almost<br>
entirely directed towards the study of the 'outer world'. But in the end<br>
I am pushing for a bridging of the gap between the 'inner' and 'outer<br>
worlds' so that we can realize and effectively employ an<br>
emotive-cognitive continuum, a continuum of consciousness. In the end it<br>
is not so much about separation, for that is what we have now, but it is<br>
about reconciliation, a reconciliation between the subjective and<br>
objective, between the emotive and cognitive. I will often push for the<br>
extreme, in which case I take a binary stance, but this is only in the<br>
hopes that we can reach the true goal, which is a balance that we are<br>
very certainly lacking in education as a whole. I have often found it<br>
easier to achieve something, if I shoot for something well beyond it.<br>
With that said, I will be more careful in the future to speak of degrees<br>
within continuums rather than abstracted dichotomous absolutes.<br>
<p>
<p>
Crosby, do you see the potential benefit of assimilating emotive<br>
education into our current cognitive educations? If so, I would be<br>
particularly interested in what you believe should be avoided, and what<br>
should be given special concern in creating a model or proposal for<br>
such. It is my intention to develop and create such a proposal, and<br>
before I release it, I want to have something rigorous, realistic, and<br>
fairly easy to implement. I want to have something that will not be<br>
immiediately discarded as flaky or new age ... which it is most<br>
certainly not to be. As one of my greatest critics, I would appreciate<br>
it if you might take a moment to temporarilly entertain the idea that<br>
you are embracing the concept of assimilating emotive education into our<br>
current cognitive educations. If you were the president of an<br>
educational institution, what would it take to sell you on the idea of<br>
implementing emotive education? What would immiediately compel you to<br>
discard it? You have already mentioned a few things that are directly<br>
critical of what I have been currently espousing, but can you offer<br>
constructive criticism beyond that point? I believe this would expediate<br>
our process while helping to avoid needless arguments. <br>
<p>
Actually, I am most interested in what anyone on this list would have to<br>
say on this matter.   <br>
<p>
I hope to offer a proposal which is congruous with Extropian,<br>
Libertarian, and Transhumanistic thought. Thus the opionions, comments,<br>
and suggestions of those on this list is greatly appreciated. Once a<br>
tentative proposal is furnished, development can begin immiediately.<br>
<p>
<p>
I believe that it is now evident that an emotive education could prove<br>
beneficial and that such is now realistically possible. I would like to<br>
move on to an intermittant discussion of what such should or should not,<br>
and may or may not entail. What should be avoided and what should be<br>
emphasized.<br>
<p>
Is anyone interested in a think tank?   <br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
