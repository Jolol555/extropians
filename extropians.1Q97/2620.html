<p>
The above sounds more like a personal and verbally *violent* attack than<br>
it does a rational argument. Replace the utopic thing with the extropian<br>
concept of DYNAMIC OPTIMISM. No I do not believe we will always be<br>
violent entities. The problem is once again in the lack of concern<br>
people have for taking responsibility for their emotions. Most people<br>
are unaware of the extent of their violent desires. Unaware of these<br>
desires they are unable to *rationally* modify them. This issue has a<br>
great deal less to do with morality than it does with psychology.<br>
Morality is what the behaviorist sees on the surface, and from the<br>
surface science attempts to treat the symptoms. We need to delve much<br>
further into the psyche. Hitherto however science has completely lacked<br>
the ability to work with such subjective [non-objective] matters. Thus<br>
they are ignored entirely! Modern science attempts to rationalize the<br>
subconscious away so that it does not have to deal with it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The act of turning towards extropy or turning towards entropy is a moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolute.</i><br>
<p>
A moral absolute? Ideally I'm sure, but how about in praxis. A person<br>
can make a rational decision to keep a new years resolution, but if they<br>
are unwilling to admit of their subconscious, and thus to create<br>
techniques and technology for delving into it, that person may not be<br>
able to keep that resolution do to the force of underlying,<br>
unquestioned, subconscious emotions.<br>
<p>
My interest in emotive responsibility and emotive concern in science is<br>
not so that emotions take over, but just the very opposite. If we ignore<br>
them then they control us without our being aware of it. Deny it and you<br>
remain naive and determined. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Those who have turned towards extropy, or the culture of life,</i><br>
<i>&gt; must defend themselves from those who have turned towards entropy, or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture of death.</i><br>
<p>
No, by doing this you merely embrace the "culture of death" and become<br>
one yourself. The extropian idea is ascension. Its about rising above<br>
this primitive *rationality* of justifying violence and the appreciation<br>
of violence and its tools.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  An entirely extropic vocation is to specialize in</i><br>
<i>&gt; development of superior violent technology to prohibitively raise the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of action to those who would destroy what one loves.</i><br>
<p>
Circles and cylces. Repetition. Perpetuation of the same old thing.<br>
"I've got bigger balls than you do." This need to show others that we<br>
are stronger is caused by excess dopamine in the central nervous system.<br>
It is primitive. Our governent sells arms to third world countries. We<br>
then wait for them to pick them up and use them so that we can have an<br>
excuse to dominate someone else, thus showing our strength, while<br>
justifying our ludicrous "defense" budget. Intresting how its called a<br>
defense budget, with the bias on defense rather than offense. I think<br>
thats memetic propoganda myself.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; For a modern course in what prevents war, [SNIP]</i><br>
<p>
Prevent is not the right word here. Postpone is better. Its still a<br>
competition. Two entities struggling to create more powerful tools of<br>
desctruction. One day, one of the entities might just develop its<br>
offenseive technology faster than the other entity develops its<br>
defensive technology. At this point the *stronger* offensive country has<br>
control to either manipulate or destroy the other country.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Violence is perpetuated by an appreciation or desire for violence. You<br>
cannot cease violence by being violent. You merely perpetuate the cycle.<br>
How is that progressive? How is that rational? How is that extropian? <br>
<p>
Look at our entertainment industry. It is fueled by our appreciation of<br>
violence. It is fueled by our fear, hatred, and paranoia.<br>
<p>
You have been arguing with me about how you are completely aware of all<br>
your emotions and their underlying motivations. Well, perhaps you should<br>
check where some of your violent urges come from. I believe the desire<br>
to do violence is a projection upon others one's desire to have violence<br>
done to him/herself. People have violent urges when they feel insecure.<br>
That insecurity comes from within and without. It comes from within when<br>
a person is unappreciative of themself, when they feel inadequate,<br>
unable to consciously bare the feeling that they want to die, they will<br>
often express this in violent thought, or the appreciation of violence<br>
in entertainment, and when taken to the extreme they will commit actual<br>
acts of violence. From without it comes when one is threatened by the<br>
other, but if one breaks down emotively and thus rationally and chooses<br>
to persist in playing the violent game with the other, then that fear<br>
and paranoia will be cultivated. If we did not always react to insecure<br>
feelings with immidiate violent feelings, then we might just be able to<br>
use that same reactive mental energy to focus on creating *progressive*<br>
non-violent alternatives.  <br>
