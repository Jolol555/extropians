I'm not sure why people equate high SAT scores with high intelligence, <br>
especially with genius.  I took the SAT, and I did excellently, but the test <br>
didn't test my intelligence as much as it tested my knowledge.  None of the <br>
math questions required any creative solutions; they were all pretty <br>
straightforward and simple, given a familiarity with math.  The verbal section <br>
was a little less straightforward, but still easy, given the proper knowledge; <br>
one section of it required a familiarity with the proper syntax and grammer of <br>
English and an ability to spot errors in passages.  Other sections required an <br>
understanding of English and an ability to answer basic questions about a <br>
passage one read.  That's it.  That's all the test is; it just tests how well <br>
people know math and English.  One could argue that it takes a certain amount <br>
of intelligence to have learned math and English well by the time one takes <br>
the test, but it really tests very little, just some basic skills.<br>
<p>
To get a real understanding of someone's intelligence requires much more <br>
elaborate testing.  Part of intelligence is learning speed, so people should <br>
be given lots of new activities to perform, and they should be observed to see <br>
how long it takes them to develop competence at the new activities and what <br>
sorts of strategies they use.  Other aspects of intelligence are ingeniousness <br>
and resoursfulness and the ability to make elaborate plans and carry them out, <br>
so people should be asked to complete various tasks, such as building devices <br>
which have certain properties, given certain materials to do it with or <br>
programming a computer to accomplish elaborate tasks.  Other aspects of <br>
intelligence involve problem solving, so people being observed should be given <br>
problems, of all kinds, to solve, and their basic strategies and how long it <br>
takes them to solve various kinds of problems should be observed.  Other <br>
aspects of intelligence require knowledge of oneself, so people should be <br>
interviewed extensively, to see how clearly they understand themselves.  Other <br>
aspects of intelligence involve being able to think clearly and deeply and <br>
understand things clearly, so people should submit several essays and papers, <br>
explaining their philosophical understanding of things.  And there are many <br>
other aspects of intelligence, and to get a useful understanding of a person's <br>
intelligence requires elaborate and extensive testing and observation, and the <br>
results will not be some number, such as an intelligence quotient, but it will <br>
be a detailed breakdown of how well the individual does at different types of <br>
cognitive skills as well as an explanation of the individual's general <br>
strategies for learning and problem solving.  Intelligence is not a quantity; <br>
it is a collection of cognitive skills.<br>

exercising your mind and growing more intelligent. --<br>
