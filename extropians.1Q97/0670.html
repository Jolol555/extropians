Duh, in physics there's a widely-used concept of "order of magnitude" <br>
calculations were you simply try to get within a factor of ten of the real<br>
value. A factor of three is pretty good when you're only aiming for a<br>
factor of ten. Whether it's fifteen or six tons is immaterial, because<br>
it's certainly *not* ten thousand tons. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not at all. I was referring to atmospheric impacts. According to James,</i><br>

<p>
But as I pointed out, by James calculations a 10MT groundburst nuke on the<br>
moon will have the roughly same effect on underground structures as on the<br>
Earth. <br>

<p>
The moon has a factor of four energy advantage, Earth has nukes; That's<br>
it. As you say yourself, "there's no such thing as a free lunch";  shame<br>
that Heinlein didn't apply that maxim to his own scenarios and not just to<br>
other people's. <br>
