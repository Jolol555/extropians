&lt;The 'savannah'  scenario just doesn't cut it, so far as I can see&gt;<br>

John K Clark responded:<br>
&lt;I agree, that never made much sense to me, if anything it seems that <br>
bipedalism would do better in a dense jungle that a open savanna, but <br>
if the savanna theory is wrong that doesn't mean that the Aquatic Ape <br>
theory is right.&gt;<br>
<p>
Given that we evolved from apes, which were already semi-erect and <br>
adapted primarily to brachiating through trees, if we stayed in the <br>
dense jungle I doubt if we would have evolved to full bipedalism - <br>
wouldn't we have just continued swinging and climbing through the <br>
trees or crawling around under the bushes?<br>
<p>
On the open savanna, on the other hand, there's several advantages to <br>
bipedalism:<br>
* given that 'we' were _already_ semi-erect, it's unlikely we would <br>
have reverted back to something 4-legged;<br>
* so, the need to cover greater distances meant we would have needed <br>
an alternate way to run fast, e.g., bipedalism;<br>
* being able to stand fully erect also allows the animal to see <br>
farther across the open savanna and more ably find prey or avoid <br>
danger;<br>
* finally, there's the 'throwing hypothesis' which proposes that, <br>
starting with the pre-existing combination of arms and legs (plus <br>
already being an omnivore), the best adaptation for earning a living <br>
would be to hunt game by throwing projectiles.<br>

P.S. I recall the List discussing this 'throwing hypothesis' early <br>
last fall or summer but can't remember what evidence some cited <br>
against this or the savanna scenario.<br>
