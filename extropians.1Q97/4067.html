<i>&gt; THis really ticks me off. They ought to press murder or some other</i><br>
<i>&gt; charges against Shramek, the amateur astronomer who claimed that he</i><br>
<i>&gt; spotted a huge "saturn-like" ufo behind Hale-Bopp several months ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's his scientific fraud that perpetrated all this crap. The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt; he was shown to be wrong but refused to acknowledge the truth publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a damn crime. THis is one example of all the people he's hoodwinked</i><br>
<i>&gt; with his BS.</i><br>
<p>
Caveat Lector.  That seems like just another "blame the speaker" rant<br>
for what is a deficiency in the listener.  If they willingly believed<br>
a man with less credibility than the Enquirer, and cheerfully killed<br>
themselves (and every indication is that they were sober and "jovial"<br>
in their last moments), and he didn't actually encourage them to kill<br>
themselves or defraud them of money or anything, I'd say we just chalk<br>
it up to not-so-natural selection.<br>
<p>
Otherwise, we'd have to charge every chruch in the world with too many<br>
crimes to count.<br>
