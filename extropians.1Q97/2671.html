<i>&gt; two.  It will take strong arguments to convince people to change</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems, and in the meantime I do not think it ill to attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ameliorate the effects and modes of governance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One item is that peaceful voluntary disgovernance involves something like</i><br>
<i>&gt; forcing Congress to disband.  It might be easier to force a replacement</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Congress with a random government, and then to convince those</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislators to disband, as they would have less personal stake in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I guess I missed the original explaination, but am I to assume that a<br>
random government is one where all elected or appointed positions are<br>
filled by lottery instead? <br>
<p>
That woud be an interesting SOP, and would at the same time be useful as<br>
a fund raising instrument. Of course, there would need to be some<br>
serious checks and balances to prevent anyone from  just buying enough<br>
tickets to obtain the position by overwhelming odds, say, any one person<br>
can only buy $2,000 in Presidential Lotto Tickets each year or four<br>
years, $10,000 for senate seats, and $50,000 for representative seats<br>
(sue to the dilution of power with more people in the given body, there<br>
is less danger of causing harm.) <br>
<p>
Possibly also, any given law would need to either be passed by two of<br>
three successive congresses, and signed by two of three successive<br>
Presidents to become law, or might even simply be put to a Russian<br>
Roulette type test, where a set percentage of laws are randomly passed,<br>
and another set percentage randomly failed, and the rest must pass by a<br>
supermajority.<br>
<p>
Another concept to explore is  Hyperdemocracy, where every voter has<br>
veto power over any law, so the only laws that would pass would be those<br>
that all agree on. Under such a system, since the only laws allowed are<br>
those that all agree do not harm anyone, there is no tyranny of the<br>
majority. Now we do have the case where a law may be passed which harms<br>
no one at a given time, but may harm someone at a later date, possibly<br>
that someone has come of voting age in the meantime. Given this, there<br>
would need to be a sort of ballot initiative mechanism, where if one can<br>
convince a minimum number of people of  the need for a vote on<br>
something, not just to change a law, but to reratify  a law which may<br>
have become burdensome since its inception, then a new vote may be<br>
called, but only after a given period from the original laws enactment.<br>
<p>
What is important in such a system is to start off with a minimum number<br>
of laws, possibly just a Bill of Rights.<br>
<p>
Both random democracy and hyperdomocracy could be combined, where the<br>
judiciary and executive branches are lottery systems, and the<br>
legislature is everyone in the body politic with an equal veto power.<br>
So becoming a judge, magistrate, soldier, beauraucrat, cabinet<br>
secretary, or President is a position one is drafted for, either<br>
specifically to the job, or from a common pool. There would probably<br>
need to be both, common draft for positions below a certain level, and<br>
specific drafts for the higher level positions, possibly reqiring one to<br>
have been previously drafted from the common pool to a prior position,<br>
to at least acquaint the individual with how the government works, and<br>
possibly also with some professional requirements as well for certain<br>
positions, but not to restrictive.<br>
