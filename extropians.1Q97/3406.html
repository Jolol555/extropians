        In other words, we have *every* right to judge you as you are the<br>
creator of your ideas.  Your first impression was a breach of respect<br>
towards Natasha.  Instead of apologizing or responding to another thread,<br>
you (yes *you* Mr. Carwash) decided to persist in your ideas that *we* are<br>
wrong and *you* are right.  You have judged us, and now you whine about how<br>
we can't judge you?  Sorry, you've lost your rights.<br>
