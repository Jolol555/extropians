Jay I think your apostasy ius important.  I'm new to thie list, so havent<br>
posted yet. I subscribe to some principles of transhumanism and not others.<br>
 Some libertarian ideas and not others.  The people who want to evangelize<br>
the package as a whole strike me as cultist, with the earmarks of that style.<br>
 Of course the memes transfer better that way.  I find your poosition more<br>
valid and more interesting.  <br>
