I found your post fascinating because I have been through very similar<br>
experiences myself, and maybe many other extropians have too. With regard<br>
to the above passage, while it's very inspiring and admirable, do<br>
you feel that you derive enough happiness from life by pursuing only these<br>
goals? You mentioned that you felt that your family had as much importance<br>
as the bushes outside. What do you think about the concept of the family<br>
itself, and how does it fit into extropian thinking? On what level of<br>
importance do you rank love and friendship in your envisioned future?<br>
 I consider Nietzche to have been an "incredibly brilliant genius"<br>
but he died miserable, without friends, and insane. This was probably<br>
because he cut himself off from the rest of humanity too much. His<br>
"reevaluation of all values" seems to have taken a huge toll on his<br>
nervous system.<br>
<p>
I suppose the purpose of this list is so that we can find other people who<br>
share in our goals, and also not lose sight of the fact that no man is an<br>
island.<br>
