Well, domestication _was_ a process of co-evolution.  According to<br>
Diamond some areas were domesticating plants, but they started late and<br>
went slower.  Mesoamerica, using corn, or the Eastern US, using things<br>
they quickly abandoned once corn finally came up to them, would be<br>
examples.  Australia and California would be examples of agriculture not<br>
happening at all.<br>
<p>
But the evidence covers 13,000 years, and you're suggesting 10 million<br>
years of hunter-gatherers, so you may have a point.  Or dogs or llamas<br>
could have been bred to other purposes.  Or guinea pigs could have been<br>
bred to be really big, if someone saw a point.  On the other hand, if my<br>
idea of why African megafauna wasn't domesticable is correct, exposure<br>
to hominids might just cause animals to be more vicious and wary.  With<br>
any more docile animals getting eaten before their value could be realized.<br>
<p>
This would be one of the kinks in the Great Filter.  The previous idea<br>
was that was optimal for the origin of life, Earth for the survival, so<br>
life would require origin on a Mars-like planet and transmission to an<br>
Earth-like world.  My kink would be an Africa-Eurasia setup, where<br>
animals can be exposed to us for long enough to survive skilled hunters<br>
but not so long they're impossible to domesticate when needed.<br>
