 BioWar<br>
<p>
     Wake-up call! Some of the world's farthest-out, cutting-edge, and<br>
     high-technodazzle biotech thinking is now being done not by<br>
     scientists and academics, but by the military.<br>
<p>
     By Ed Regis<br>
<p>
     On May 9 1996, by email, I received an invitation to attend a<br>
     biotechnology workshop at the Army War College. The combination<br>
     did not add up - not immediately. The biotech industry, after all,<br>
     was engaged mainly in making new drugs or making old ones by new<br>
     methods: you fiddled with the genes of certain microorganisms and<br>
     tricked them into producing insulin, human growth hormone, or<br>
     whatever. Clever, but still rather prosaic - nothing that the army<br>
     would be holding a conference about.<br>
<p>
     Then again, some of biotech's more wild-eyed dreamers had imagined<br>
     lots of semi-science fictional biotechnology applications, like<br>
     altering an organism's genes to such an extent that you created an<br>
     entirely new animal, a special-purpose "designer" organism,<br>
     anything from a new species of lab rat to a human being<br>
     reverse-engineered for desired traits. Most of this was pretty<br>
     far-out: people with gills for staying underwater, people with<br>
     genuine body armor - Mr. Armadillo - hard-shell skins that bullets<br>
     would bounce off, a human physique that included new-wave<br>
     musculature, night vision, computer-chip-assisted memory, faster,<br>
     bigger, and better brains.<br>
<p>
     But that was Hollywood: that was Robocop, The Terminator, the Six<br>
     Billion Dollar Bionic Wonder Woman. The army, I thought, couldn't<br>
     be interested in that, either.<br>
<p>
     And anyway, why me? True, I was the author of a book about<br>
     nanotechnology, a science in which tiny molecular robots would be<br>
     able to assemble any object, substance, or structure permitted by<br>
     the laws of nature. These robots, I'd written, "could be<br>
     programmed by some enemy power - or worse, a terrorist group - to<br>
     slip over the border on a gust of wind, enter your body, and turn<br>
     your bones to slime."<br>
<p>
     Aha. A concept of military interest.<br>
<p>
     And in an earlier work I'd talked about converting ordinary<br>
     everyday humans into "transhumans," fabulous turbocharged<br>
     specimens who sailed across the universe, learned its secrets,<br>
     became omnipotent, and lived forever. Both of these books argued<br>
     that all of this stuff, insane as it was, could really happen.<br>
     None of it violated natural law.<br>
<p>
     And then, suddenly, I could see the whole picture: the conference,<br>
     titled Biotechnology Workshop 2020, would focus on battles to be<br>
     fought in the future. These battles would not be limited to the<br>
     hand grenades, assault rifles, and land mines of the 20th century<br>
     - they would feature entirely new categories of weapons, munitions<br>
     based on the biotech advances that would occur in the interim. The<br>
     army, I concluded, was looking to produce fleets of attack<br>
     microbes - maybe even a race of supersoldiers - by tinkering with<br>
     DNA, the molecular basis of all life. And they wanted my<br>
     far-seeing, penetrating, and all-knowing advice and counsel.<br>
<p>
     So of course I said yes.<br>
<p>
     The Army War College, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, at the crossroads<br>
     of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Interstate 81, was a scene of<br>
     vast amounts of truckage and muckage, engine noise and diesel<br>
     fumes. The campus is ordinary: red brick classroom buildings,<br>
     athletic fields, health clinic, chapel, a bunch of little white<br>
     clapboard houses where the officers live. From the looks of it, it<br>
     could be a college campus anywhere in the country.<br>
<p>
     Except for Collins Hall, site of the workshop and home of the<br>
     army's Center for Strategic Leadership. At the time of the<br>
     conference, the place had just been constructed, and it looked as<br>
     if it had been built to stage an opera about a rocket launch. It<br>
     was bristling with architectural setbacks and galleries, balconies<br>
     and turretlike structures. Entrance to the building was highly<br>
     restricted: you checked in with a guard, got an electronic access<br>
     key, and were admitted through a turnstile. You exited the same<br>
     way. "If you walk out the wrong door, you'll be shot," joked one<br>
     of the officers.<br>
<p>
     The workshop was to take place in the Normandy Conference Room,<br>
     the army's version of NASA Mission Control Headquarters - a tall,<br>
     square, hushed chamber done in soft grays and greens. A large<br>
     white screen at the front was flanked by digital clocks and<br>
     electronic signboards that said, in red lettering: "Unclassified"<br>
     and "Not Recording." Underneath the signs were large panes of<br>
     one-way glass, as if we'd be under observation by a bank of<br>
     psychiatrists. On the walls farther back were oil paintings the<br>
     size of murals, of battle scenes - the Normandy invasion, one<br>
     supposed - scenes of explosions, fires, and hot gases, of smoke<br>
     rising and structures collapsing, walls turning into rubble, jeeps<br>
     capsizing, cannons firing, soldiers running, falling, calling<br>
     out....<br>
<p>
     The focal point of the room was an enormous U-shaped conference<br>
     table on which stood 20 or so computer terminals and, facing them,<br>
     an equal number of plush, green, high-backed chairs. One of the<br>
     participants, sitting down, did not like the view: "All you can<br>
     see is the whites of the backs of their computers," he complained.<br>
     He was hot for "eye contact." He would not get much of it.<br>
<p>
     The two dozen experts now settling in were about half military and<br>
     half civilian. The latter were in fields such as virology,<br>
     evolutionary theory, and commercial biotechnology and hailed from<br>
     such places as UCLA, Rockefeller University, the National<br>
     Institutes of Health, the Institute for Biological Detection<br>
     Systems, the Center for Human Performance and Complex Systems, and<br>
     from firms called Nanotronics Inc. (a nanotechnology R&amp;D firm) and<br>
     Orion Enterprises Inc. (a consulting firm with military clients).<br>
     The army people, some in uniform and some not, were from Fort<br>
     Knox, the Pentagon, the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and so on, and<br>
     were attached to places with names like Future Battle Directorate,<br>
     Battlefield Environments Directorate, and US Army Chem/Bio Defense<br>
     Command - whatever that was.<br>
<p>
     This was the setup: We'd be given a series of expert briefings on<br>
     biotechnology, on biotechnology and the army, on recent work in<br>
     "human performance enhancements," and the like. Then we'd be given<br>
     three alternate versions of the general world situation circa<br>
     2020, along with a specific conflict situation in each case. Our<br>
     job was to somehow take these three hypothetical scenarios, gaze<br>
     into a crystal ball, and divine the future of biotech weaponry.<br>
     The army would then be guided by our mystic visions when funding<br>
     time came.<br>
<p>
     There was a slightly Through the Looking-Glass feel to it all, as<br>
     if this roomful of people would be any better at soothsaying than<br>
     a bunch of chimpanzees. As if to underscore the point, Lieutenant<br>
     Colonel Joe Pecoraro, then chief of the Army Research Laboratory's<br>
     Future Technologies Institute, the agency sponsoring the workshop,<br>
     explained that the whole proceeding would be conducted on<br>
     nonattribution rules, meaning that who said exactly what could<br>
     never be reported to anyone else.<br>
<p>
     Finally, a word from Major George Hluck, the facility's smiling<br>
     and cheery "knowledge engineer." Our computer terminals, he said,<br>
     as the display screens came to life, were for the use of the<br>
     "Topic Commenter," the army's implementation of a real-time chat<br>
     function. The chat feature would enable each of us to share our<br>
     private thoughts with the others. This was the high tech<br>
     equivalent of passing notes back and forth under the desk, and<br>
     having it at our disposal here was almost too good to be true.<br>
<p>
     We were not dissuaded from using the chat function; in fact we<br>
     were encouraged, almost pressured, to do so. Please use it at any<br>
     time! Pass along those notes! Just type in your comments about<br>
     anything at all - but especially about the briefing in progress -<br>
     then press the Send key and Bingo! your words will magically<br>
     appear, anonymously and unsigned, on everyone else's computer<br>
     screen.<br>
<p>
     And so a minute later, clickata-clickata-clickata, anonymous<br>
     comments were bubbling up on our displays, trenchant observations<br>
     on the order of:<br>
<p>
     It is ethically questionable to solicit anonymous comments.Darn,<br>
     what a SUPER briefing that was!!!<br>
<p>
     July 2020, and Turkey is at war with Iran and Syria. The latter<br>
     two countries, sick of their constant water shortages, have<br>
     invaded Turkey and taken control of a major dam and reservoir.<br>
     Turkey, after mobilizing its troops, calls upon the United States<br>
     for assistance.<br>
<p>
     The US sends a total of 300,000 troops, plus navy and air force<br>
     backup units, into the area. Together, the combined US forces are<br>
     supposed to (1) throw the invaders out of Turkey, (2) advance into<br>
     Iran and Syria to incapacitate the main forces of those countries,<br>
     and (3) "locate and neutralize Iranian and Syrian nuclear,<br>
     biological, and chemical weapons, their means of delivery, and<br>
     their production facilities."<br>
<p>
     That was "Defense Planning Scenario 1."<br>
<p>
     Scenario 2 was not much different, except for the fact that Iran<br>
     and Syria were now threatening to drop a nuclear bomb on a major<br>
     Turkish population center. The US, in response, sends in eight<br>
     army assault units plus special operations forces, to (1) attack<br>
     enemy headquarters, (2) destroy their command, control, and<br>
     logistics sites, and (3) wipe out their weapons facilities.<br>
<p>
     In July 2020, however, this is no problem. First of all, our foot<br>
     soldiers are protected by biocamouflage, clothing that changes<br>
     color automatically, allowing the troops to visually merge with<br>
     the background. Their outer garments sense the ambient temperature<br>
     and harmonize with it, rendering the wearer imperceptible to<br>
     temperature-sensing devices, heat-seeking weapons, or infrared<br>
     detectors. The troops become as invisible as chameleons, for the<br>
     same reasons, and by essentially the same biological mechanisms.<br>
<p>
     The enemy, however, is not invisible - not to the army's newly<br>
     developed artificial smart noses. The Americans ferret out their<br>
     adversaries by means of biosensors, biologically based olfactory<br>
     sensing units that discover the presence, location, and strength<br>
     of opposing troop concentrations by detecting - believe it or not<br>
     - their odors, the characteristic airborne molecules or<br>
     "downstream effluents" they discharge.<br>
<p>
     Having pinpointed the enemy battalions, the US troops now advance<br>
     toward them and deploy a full range of nonlethal, nonhuman<br>
     bioweapons - antimaterial microbes, for example. These genetically<br>
     engineered organisms have been programmed to eat the rubber from<br>
     enemy vehicles, decimating their tires, engine gaskets, coolant<br>
     hoses, and fuel lines. Other antimaterial microorganisms<br>
     infiltrate fuel tanks and turn their stores of gas and diesel oil<br>
     to masses of incombustible jelly. Still others selectively target<br>
     and destroy the adversary's silicon devices: they eat the insides<br>
     of their computers, command and control systems, navigational<br>
     instruments, and anything else containing a silicon chip. These<br>
     spreading, hungry bioagents immobilize enemy forces by turning<br>
     their hardware into blobs of goo.<br>
<p>
     In latter-day military parlance, this is "soft kill" - disabling<br>
     the enemy's infrastructure. "Hard kill" - physically maiming or<br>
     killing the adversary - has not gone out of style in 2020, but<br>
     there are now some distinctly improved methods of doing it. Enemy<br>
     leaders, for example, can be knocked off by means of genetically<br>
     engineered superpathogens that are so selective in their behavior<br>
     they're capable of targeting specific individuals, verifying their<br>
     identities by means of their DNA sequences. They'd have been able<br>
     to erase Adolf Hitler from the face of the earth while leaving<br>
     everyone else whole and unharmed.<br>
<p>
     Out on the battlefield, meanwhile, complex tactical decisions are<br>
     made by biocomputers the size of sugar cubes. Stored in the<br>
     computer's biomemory are summaries of the most successful battle<br>
     strategies in history, from the ancient Greeks to the present,<br>
     plus local terrain maps, dictionaries of the native languages,<br>
     guides to local flora and fauna, maybe even a list of Turkey's<br>
     best restaurants, complete with menus, prices, and ordering<br>
     information.<br>
<p>
     The American troops, however, instantly "grow" their food and<br>
     drink, their fuels and supplies - including bullets and explosives<br>
     - by manufacturing them on-site, molecule by molecule, out of the<br>
     biofeedstock molecules that they carry along with them. Such<br>
     on-the-spot "bioprocessing" technologies have revolutionized troop<br>
     supply and logistics, doing away with the long and vulnerable<br>
     provisions caravans of yore.<br>
<p>
     These well-fed and continually replenished soldiers are kept<br>
     healthy and disease-free by means of DNA vaccinations that have<br>
     made them immune to all known pathogens. Old-style vaccinations<br>
     worked by introducing mild viruses into humans with the object of<br>
     provoking an immune response. These new vaccines avoid the risks<br>
     of injecting people with deadly agents; they work, instead,<br>
     directly at the DNA level. Patients are injected with specially<br>
     tailored strands of DNA that cause their immune systems to<br>
     generate the entire array of needed antibodies. In consequence,<br>
     the subjects become immune to every pathogen they might encounter,<br>
     everything from yellow fever, malaria, and hepatitis to cholera,<br>
     Ebola, and HIV - plus whatever new-wave viruses have freshly<br>
     emerged.<br>
<p>
     If and when they finally go into battle, the troops are<br>
     safeguarded by microbe-grown body enclosures that hold back not<br>
     only poison gases and biological and chemical agents but also the<br>
     otherwise deadly projectile. The bodysuit, in addition, increases<br>
     the wearer's overall strength by means of precisely placed<br>
     artificial musculature that boosts the power of arms, legs,<br>
     fingers, and toes. The soldier's protective helmet is equipped<br>
     with bio-based, high-resolution night-vision devices that<br>
     effectively turn darkness into daylight.<br>
<p>
     Any injuries sustained in spite of all this camouflage,<br>
     nourishment, biological immunity, and physical protection are<br>
     cured with accelerated healing technologies. In the field, wounds<br>
     are speed-healed by the application of enzymatic growth factors<br>
     and are then patched over by intelligent bioadhesives instead of<br>
     dumb bandages. Those more seriously hurt are put into suspended<br>
     animation before being medevac'd out to hospitals, where<br>
     artificial blood, bones, tissues, and ligaments - even whole<br>
     organs - are bioproduced and implanted into the injured as needed.<br>
<p>
     And then, when it's all over, the troops clean up as they go by<br>
     the use of sophisticated "bioremediation" systems. Fleets of<br>
     programmed microbes decontaminate and detoxify the entire area,<br>
     leaving it in a condition as good as, if not better than, it was<br>
     in the first place.<br>
<p>
     By the time the soldiers leave, it's as if the war had never<br>
     happened.<br>
<p>
     We at the army's biotechnology workshop, unfortunately, had not<br>
     come up with any of this. More bizarre than some of the crazed<br>
     ideas themselves was the fact that all of our thinking had been<br>
     done for us, well in advance, by the army, and by the workshop's<br>
     organizers, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)<br>
     of McLean, Virginia. SAIC, whose gaming division runs war games<br>
     for all branches of the military, had been hired by the army to<br>
     research, plan, and moderate the whole two-day extravaganza.<br>
<p>
     Steven Kenney, of SAIC's Strategic Assessment Center, had FedExed<br>
     all of us a little read-ahead package, 200 pages of technical,<br>
     semitechnical, and popular writings about the latest biotech<br>
     advances and their potential application to warfare. Included,<br>
     among other things, were several chapters from biotechnology<br>
     textbooks, an article from Scientific American about directed<br>
     molecular evolution, and two pieces from Wired: "Neurobotics," by<br>
     Michael Gruber (Wired 2.10, page 110), about using rat-brain<br>
     tissue to solve chemical-engineering problems; and "Gene Genie,"<br>
     by Thomas Bass (Wired 3.08, page 114), about the DNA computer.<br>
     Also included were excerpts from the army's own in-house STAR 21<br>
     report, compiled by the National Research Council. Subtitled<br>
     "Strategic Technologies for the Army of the Twenty-First Century,"<br>
     it sketched out a representative sampling of biotech weaponry.<br>
     Capping the read-ahead were two SAIC-produced white papers titled<br>
     "Biotechnology - Projections," and "Biotechnology - Military<br>
     Applications." Collectively, these documents laid out everything<br>
     for us, chapter and verse, in great and exhaustive detail. Our<br>
     function, it seemed increasingly evident, was merely to cough back<br>
     up their sum and substance. The participants themselves soon<br>
     noticed as much:<br>
<p>
     This is, in many respects, a repeat of the read-ahead.The workshop<br>
     seems to be a rehash of already extant laundry lists of<br>
     technologies to me. Our contribution may be the addition of the<br>
     preface "bio-" to all other nouns relating to warfare.<br>
<p>
     The question arose, then, as to why the workshop had been held -<br>
     especially in view of its roughly US$100,000 price tag.<br>
<p>
     "Three reasons," Joe Pecoraro, the Future Technologies Institute<br>
     chief, said a couple of months later. "One, there was the hope<br>
     that someone would say something unique. Did that happen? I'm not<br>
     sure.<br>
<p>
     "Another reason was that I wanted to get a notion from the<br>
     military themselves as to which applications would be of most use<br>
     to them. Just because something's got a use to the civilian sector<br>
     doesn't mean it's got any use to the military.<br>
<p>
     "And I wanted to get a line on costs. How feasible is any of this,<br>
     in terms of cost and development time?"<br>
<p>
     Some months prior to the workshop, Kenney, coauthor of SAIC's<br>
     white paper on the military applications of biotechnology,<br>
     actually had given Pecoraro at least some of what he was looking<br>
     for. Kenney had contacted representatives of eight military<br>
     organizations - the Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth<br>
     and the Army Armor Center at Fort Knox, among others -<br>
     specifically to get their views concerning biotech's military<br>
     potential, and he had then incorporated a summary of their<br>
     opinions into the white paper.<br>
<p>
     As for the workshop, it did not yield the ranking of biotech<br>
     applications that Pecoraro was after. At the end, participants<br>
     were asked to list the several military applications in order of<br>
     their probable usefulness in warfare. But when they did that, the<br>
     SAIC-designed algorithm for this - a formal mass-voting procedure<br>
     conducted with the aid of comically misnamed "meeting facilitation<br>
     software" - underwent a meltdown in a huge bonfire of the<br>
     technologies. No two participants could agree on what, if<br>
     anything, the required numerical scores meant, or on what basis<br>
     they should be assigned. As one of the participants remembered it<br>
     later: "We rated items against undefined criteria, using a<br>
     numerical rating scheme in which the numbers assigned had meaning<br>
     only to the individual scorer. Then, we averaged these scores to<br>
     obtain a totally meaningless number. God forbid that someone<br>
     actually use the results for something!"<br>
<p>
     In view of the manner in which they were obtained, that was an<br>
     unlikely prospect.<br>
<p>
     James Valdes, who gave us the Army and Biotechnology briefing, is<br>
     the army's scientific adviser for biotechnology. He works at what<br>
     in the old days was the Edgewood Arsenal, part of the Aberdeen<br>
     Proving Ground, in Maryland. In these times of nomenclature<br>
     inflation, it has become the Edgewood Research, Development, and<br>
     Engineering Center, and Valdes works at the US Army Chemical and<br>
     Biological Defense Command.<br>
<p>
     Physically, the place hasn't changed much over the years. It's a<br>
     flat spit of pine barrens that juts out into Chesapeake Bay. Deer<br>
     graze calmly along the roadsides, beside chain-link fences topped<br>
     with alternating coils of barbed wire and razor wire. Inside the<br>
     first fence is a no-man's-land, then another identical fence.<br>
     Watchful TV cameras point up and down the no-man's-land, and<br>
     rusted signs nearby read: "Warning," "Danger," "Restricted Area,"<br>
     and (the biggie) "Use of Deadly Force Authorized."<br>
<p>
     Jay Valdes, who runs Edgewood's biotech program, did postdoctoral<br>
     work at Johns Hopkins in neurotoxicology. He's a precise,<br>
     personable, and friendly type, a nautical chap who keeps a 20-foot<br>
     sailboat out on the Chesapeake and can rattle off the differences<br>
     between schooner, bark, sloop, ketch, and yawl as easily as he can<br>
     enumerate the several varieties of nerve gas.<br>
<p>
     The army's "contaminant degrading" organisms are nothing new to<br>
     him. There are tons of them at Edgewood, and they aren't even<br>
     genetically engineered. They're just plain microbes, just<br>
     standard, run-of-the-mill soil bacteria, albeit ones with<br>
     specialized eating abilities and acquired tastes. Some of them eat<br>
     petroleum products, a proficiency they've acquired all by<br>
     themselves.<br>
<p>
     "If you have a site that's been contaminated with petroleum<br>
     products," Valdes explains, "then just by natural selection, the<br>
     microbes that live in the soil will have evolved mechanisms to<br>
     enable them to degrade petroleum products. The microbes that eat<br>
     them survive; the ones that don't die. Thus, they select<br>
     themselves out."<br>
<p>
     So if you want to get rid of, degrade, or otherwise<br>
     "dematerialize" a patch of petroleum, you merely go out to a<br>
     contaminated site and collect samples of the indigenous soil<br>
     bacteria. You bring them back to the lab, separate out those that<br>
     eat the noxious pollutants, and then culture up big vats of them.<br>
     Later, you go back out into the field and deposit the cultured<br>
     petroleum eaters wherever they're needed. Not long afterward, the<br>
     microbes have converted the noxious pollutants into harmless, or<br>
     maybe even helpful, by-products.<br>
<p>
     Formally, this is known as in situ biodegradation; the process<br>
     works so well against a wide range of contaminants that several<br>
     private cleanup companies now ply the trade commercially. The<br>
     army's biodegradation needs are somewhat specialized, however,<br>
     there being large stockpiles of chemical agents - mustard gas, for<br>
     example, left over from the good old days - that by law must be<br>
     destroyed and turned into innocuous waste. Biotechnology can play<br>
     a role here, because if you can identify the specific enzyme that<br>
     a microbe uses to degrade a given chemical, then you can<br>
     manufacture the enzyme itself and apply it to the chemical<br>
     directly.<br>
<p>
     "And if you can identify the gene that codes for the particular<br>
     enzyme that breaks down your pollutant," Valdes explains, "then<br>
     you can clone that gene and produce that enzyme in large<br>
     quantities."<br>
<p>
     At the Process Engineering Facility, a new $15 million building at<br>
     Edgewood, the needed enzymes are produced in fermentation tanks<br>
     and then tested for effectiveness on 20-foot-tall columns of<br>
     contaminated soil. If the process works in the lab, it ought to<br>
     work just as well in the field; the hope is that these experiments<br>
     will yield an environmentally friendly way of turning poisonous<br>
     agents into benign substances.<br>
<p>
     The hot-ticket item in military biotech circles these days,<br>
     however, is the biosensor, an electromechanical device that<br>
     detects airborne molecules in extremely small amounts. Valdes and<br>
     his colleagues are now developing biosensors. The simplest consist<br>
     of a computer chip topped with a layer of biological molecules<br>
     that selectively bond with molecules of a known compound. When<br>
     such a "recognition event" occurs, the computer chip sends a<br>
     signal, informing the human observer that there are molecules of<br>
     the substance floating about: a toxic gas, perhaps, or an<br>
     explosive. If and when they become effective at sniffing out a<br>
     wide range of deadly agents, biosensors promise an enormous<br>
     payoff, both within the military and in civilian environments,<br>
     such as airport luggage security checkpoints.<br>
<p>
     Other biotech marvels are in their earliest developmental stages,<br>
     both in the army and in private industry. Researchers at an army<br>
     R&amp;D center at Natick, Massachusetts, are working on biocamouflage<br>
     materials. Koors, an Israeli food company, is experimenting with<br>
     an algae that produces glycerol, a key ingredient in many<br>
     strategically important compounds. And at the laboratories in West<br>
     Point, Pennsylvania, researchers at Merck &amp; Co., a pharmaceutical<br>
     firm, are in early clinical trials of a DNA vaccine against<br>
     tuberculosis and another one against influenza. Also targeted are<br>
     hepatitis, malaria, and HIV.<br>
<p>
     Those applications are probably doable in the relatively near<br>
     term. Farther out, in the stargazing realm, are the more gee-whiz<br>
     notions like food-producing machinery in the battlefield,<br>
     microbe-grown bodysuits, suspended animation, and<br>
     performance-enhanced supersoldiers. Although conference members<br>
     agreed that such things were in principle possible in the sense<br>
     that they violated no known laws of nature, they could not agree<br>
     on when, if, or by whom any of them might be converted to<br>
     practical realities.<br>
<p>
     "Who can judge that?" asked one of the military scientists after<br>
     the workshop. "The future applications of biotechnology are<br>
     dependent upon scientific advancements and economics, much more so<br>
     than the needs as perceived by the likes of us."<br>
<p>
     "I think there is a reasonable chance (50-50) of success in most<br>
     of these areas," said another attendee.<br>
<p>
     "I think we'll see some of the biocamouflage material by 2020,"<br>
     said a third. "Perhaps limited bioproduction of alcohol as a<br>
     fuel."<br>
<p>
     "The bulk of the applications, in my opinion, are realistic in the<br>
     sense of being performable tasks," said still another. "This,<br>
     provided that adequate resources are forthcoming."<br>
<p>
     And provided that the research is allowed by law. Today, because<br>
     of international treaty conventions against all forms of offensive<br>
     biological weapons research, the United States is prohibited from<br>
     developing any such fancy gimmicks as DNA-targeted superpathogens.<br>
<p>
     As for the prospect of nonlethal bioweapons ever completely<br>
     replacing bombs and bullets, this, say the experts, probably will<br>
     not happen: "There will always be a need, in warfare, for<br>
     violence," said Joe Pecoraro. "We will never find a technological<br>
     solution that removes violence from warfare. The implements that<br>
     we use to conduct the violence I can't predict, but it will be<br>
     there."<br>
<p>
     Scenario 3. July, 2020: Brazil invades Venezuela seeking to<br>
     acquire its newly discovered oil reserves. Venezuela appeals to<br>
     the United States for help, and we respond by sending in the<br>
     biotroops.<br>
<p>
     This time, according to the scenario, we've got technology to<br>
     burn: biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence,<br>
     robotics - all of it has been developed and has succeeded beyond<br>
     our wildest expectations. Wars, therefore, are now conducted<br>
     long-range and by remote control. Robotic combat and remote<br>
     telepresence have replaced traditional ground warfare. On this<br>
     battlefield of the future, intelligent robots outnumber humans.<br>
<p>
     Maybe. Or at least so we thought. As to what would really happen<br>
     in the warfare situations of the future.... Well, who knew?<br>
<p>
     We have to realize that what we are doing is scripting a major<br>
     Hollywood movie about fighting an imaginary war with weapons that<br>
     don't exist yet, with technologies that are still largely on the<br>
     drawing boards and whose development and time frame is unknown. Is<br>
     this anything more than military science fiction?<br>
<p>
     Military science fiction or not, the workshop held two surprises<br>
     for me. One was that in 2020, a generation away, the United<br>
     States, according to all three scenarios, would still be sending<br>
     troops winging off across the oceans like passenger pigeons, at<br>
     the slightest provocation.<br>
<p>
     The second, bigger surprise was my realization that some of the<br>
     world's farthest-out, cutting-edge, and high-technodazzle biotech<br>
     thinking was now being done not by scientists or academics but by<br>
     the military, and not just the army. The air force's scientific<br>
     advisory board has done a study, known as "New World Vistas," that<br>
     looks 20 to 30 years into the future and foresees many of the same<br>
     biotech devices and gadgetry.<br>
<p>
     There is a reason for the military's farsightedness. The main<br>
     elements of the biotech revolution are now available to pretty<br>
     much anyone, meaning, like it or not, that the nation's enemies -<br>
     even just a handful of terrorists, perhaps - might already be<br>
     developing offensive bioweapons. Biotechnology is, after all,<br>
     "small science," the province of desktop machinery and lab<br>
     glassware as opposed to particle accelerators or nuclear reactors;<br>
     you don't need a Manhattan Project or an Apollo Program to pursue<br>
     it.<br>
<p>
     "Some potential adversaries may be ahead of us in this<br>
     technological area," says the army's STAR 21 report. "The United<br>
     States did not keep the secrets of atomic warfare for long, even<br>
     in the secretive atmosphere of the 1940s and 1950s. In the<br>
     communicative, mobile, commercial world of the next 30 years, the<br>
     data for both defensive and offensive biotechnological<br>
     breakthroughs will be uncontainable and, essentially, public<br>
     information. Almost any country will be able to possess the data."<br>
<p>
     With which those countries could create some spectacularly<br>
     damaging stealth microbes.<br>
<p>
     "They could destabilize economies," says Jay Valdes at Edgewood.<br>
     "They could selectively wipe out crops and livestock, and they<br>
     could do it with plausible deniability. 'Oh, your rice crop got<br>
     rice rust! Oh, so sorry!'<br>
<p>
     "I don't want to give anybody any ideas about how to do this," he<br>
     adds, "but I think it would be fairly straightforward."<br>
<p>
     So, the biowars may be out there in the dim distance along with<br>
     biomaterials, biomimetics, bioproduction, biocoupling,<br>
     bioremediation, biocomputers, biochips, biosensors, biofeedstocks,<br>
     biogenetics, and all the other assorted bios.<br>
<p>
     By the end of the bioworkshop, anyway, we were up to our bioears<br>
     in biothoughts:<br>
<p>
     After bio-bombing by Bio-52s, bio-gones will be bio-gones.<br>
<p>
     Bio all means.<br>
<p>
     I'm going home, bio-bio.<br>
