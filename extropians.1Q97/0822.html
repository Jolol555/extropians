<i>&gt; I'm developing a short seminar on conflict resolution skills, and for </i><br>
<i>&gt; the first time am addressing the emotional aspects of communication.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rather than present our emotional systems as something that </i><br>
<i>&gt; interferes, however, I am utilizing a concept central to Daniel </i><br>
<i>&gt; Goleman's _Emotional Intelligence_:  Humans can learn to manage and </i><br>
<i>&gt; utilize their emotional systems in concert with rationality to have more </i><br>
<i>&gt; productive and happier lives.  Goleman resists imposing an objective </i><br>
<i>&gt; standard for behavior, because he starts from the standpoint that </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotions are triggered through specific situations that can differ </i><br>
<i>&gt; with the individual.  Possessing a self-awareness of one's own </i><br>
<i>&gt; triggers is the first step to developing an understanding of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotional reactions of others.</i><br>
<p>
I applaud such efforts to identify, classify, study, and learn how<br>
to use one's emotional faculty.  I'm sure it served a useful role<br>
in our evolution to this point, and may well be a useful tool in the<br>
future as well (I do not necessarily grant descriptive evolution any<br>
normative status, though).  I am sure as well that mastery of the<br>
faculty will always be useful in interpersonal relationships.<br>
<p>
But can we not improve upon those faculties just as we improve upon<br>
speech and hearing?  Evolution failed to grant us flight, so we used<br>
reason to create airplanes.  Evolution seems to have granted us the<br>
shortcut of emotional reaction to guide us in the kind of lives we<br>
evolved in, but can't we do better?  Evolution created sex, but we<br>
created marriage, commitment, family.  Evolution created legs, but we<br>
created the automobile.  Evolution created tongues and ears, but we<br>
created the Internet.<br>
<p>
Why must we use moral codes and behaviors developed for the lives and<br>
technologies of our ancestors to guide our use of airplanes, contracts,<br>
or email?  All I am suggesting is that the old, established habits of<br>
restraint and diplomacy might not be as useful as they once were.  When<br>
argumentation was done face-to-face, a thoughless word might provoke<br>
a fist to the nose, so restraint was practical.  Why should that apply<br>
to the Internet?  Why should we not instead develop an ethic based on<br>
tolerance on the receiving end?  Wouldn't that be more likely to result<br>
in lively, unrestrained, productive discussion?<br>
<p>
I also don't see why I should grant any special cognitive status to<br>
my emotions any more than to my sight or hearing.  A blind man, and<br>
a deaf man, each following pure reason, will find the same laws of<br>
physics.  The blind man may not develop art, and the deaf man will<br>
not create music, but each will improve his life as it suits him and<br>
each will make new discoveries as he is able.  I would not choose to<br>
supress my emotions any more than I would blind myself, but I do not<br>
give them equal status with cognition.  Every inch of human progress<br>
ever made is the result of reason, and only reason.  If I can please<br>
my senses and my emotions along the way, great.  But I will not let<br>
my emotions substitute for reason in my search for progress and<br>
boundless expansion.<br>
