Since I believe that only societies that discover capitalism will be<br>
able to develop the requisite technology, I doubt that we will find many<br>
star-roving socialist/fascist collectives - the only ones we do find<br>
will be ones that stole the technology from the capitalist ones, just<br>
like here on earth.  That might happen occasionally, I suppose, but with<br>
the distances involved, it doesn't seem as likely or as frequent as the<br>
earthly case.<br>
<p>
This is one of the reasons I have always discounted contactee tales; not<br>
because the possibility of close encounters is implausible, but the<br>
stories they tell are implausible, they just don't ring true, they are<br>
cheesy and cliched collectivist.<br>
<p>
If we ever do come across any highly advanced civilisations, you can bet<br>
your bottom dollar they will be capitalistic, trader civilisations. <br>
Their first words won't be "take me to your leader", but "take me to<br>
your dealer". (As an amusing wall poster had it recently, the alien<br>
having a spliff hanging out of his mouth!)<br>
