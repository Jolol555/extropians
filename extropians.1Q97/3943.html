<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On what basis would your upload not be you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Control is a critical factor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If my brain controls my actions </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; then a copy of my brain would control it's actions </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and would not be under my control.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think you are missing the point here. The other brain would think it </i><br>
<i>&gt;was you and that you wasn't it since it didn't control your actions. </i><br>
<i>&gt;There would simply be two of you.</i><br>
<p>
They would not be me.<br>
A would think it was A, B would think it was B.<br>
Not two of me, one of each of them.<br>
One would go by one name and the other would go by another name.<br>
A would live it's life.<br>
B would live it's life.<br>
Their lives would be different.<br>
They would evovle in different environments.<br>
One side of the room can heal while the other side can harm.<br>
A gains a proton while B loses an electron.<br>
A reads from the net while B makes an interview on the phone.<br>
They are exposed to different memes.<br>
They evolve diferently.<br>
Once one thing happens to one that does not happen to the other <br>
they are no longer the same.<br>
Ever hear of the snowball effect?<br>
Imagine a small snowball rolling down a hill.<br>
It gets bigger and bigger.<br>
It only takes one small action to cause a landslide.<br>
It only takes one straw to break a camals back.<br>
One difference, no matter how small, means they are not the same.<br>
Different atoms = different people.<br>
They would have many similar qualities.<br>
They would not have all of the same qualities.<br>
Yes, they may act alike for a while.<br>
What if A's wife kills herself <br>
and in despair it concedes to be a deathist?<br>
That would not be me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; They evolve in the environment from differing perspectives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I could predict it's actions quite well from empathy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but to say that makes it me is difficult to believe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, who would it be? </i><br>
<p>
It would be it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think it is important to distinguish between </i><br>
<i>&gt;you as your current conscious thread and you as a person with certain </i><br>
<i>&gt;memories, personality and goals.</i><br>
<p>
A's exact structure and evironment in spacetime is A's.<br>
B's different exact structure and environment is B's.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The copies after forking would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;different threads of consciousness but would be the same person </i><br>
<i>&gt;We need a better terminology here.</i><br>
<p>
OK, terminology for what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  If destructive scanning techniques were used it may ruin my brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; My consciousness may consist of vaporized atoms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hardly likely. Consciousness seems to be very linked with the integrity </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the brain (or information processing system, for infomorphs)</i><br>
<p>
Imagine your brain being vaporized.<br>
<p>
Now imagine it happening vveerryy sslloowwllyy,<br>
in slow motion, still being conscious.<br>
<p>
Sound like fun?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe the brain is not as important as I thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Could I still be me without a brain?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Parden me while I get thrown for a loop.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, this is an important question. I define myself to be what I do (I </i><br>
<i>&gt;see myself as a mapping A acting on the universe), so to me what kind of </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain I have doesn't matter.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, <br>
but I worry about my sentience being linked to material substance <br>
which would require tranference.<br>
What would I be feeling if my brain were removed?<br>
I know my brain stem alone could keep my body alive until it got a new brain,<br>
but I wonder where I would seem to be.<br>
Would I be more aware of the stem, the grey matter, both, neither?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; How far have I come when I do not willingly accept simple answers </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to the most basic question?</i><br>
I suppose I have come a long way by wanting more than simplicity.<br>
