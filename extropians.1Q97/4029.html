"Functioning markets existed for foreign authors in the U.S. in the 19th<br>
century. The free market paid royalties to British authors even though<br>
those authors received no copyright protection in the US until the<br>
extension of copyright protection to foreigners in 1891. The American<br>
publishers paid the royalty in order to obtain advance galleys, even<br>
though they themselves had no legal protection against competitors who<br>
could legally copy their new releases and sell them. In the absence of<br>
state protection the authors and publishers used several voluntary and<br>
contractual arrangements for the internalization of externalities."<br>
<p>
There is an important difference between the situation then and now. With<br>
19th c. printing technology, there were large fixed costs and sizable time<br>
lags. The authorized publisher, who got the manuscript in the U.S. before<br>
it was published in Britain, could pay his fixed costs out of the early<br>
sales. A pirate would have to duplicate those fixed costs. The authorized<br>
publisher could then issue a "fighting edition"--a low cost second edition<br>
priced low enough so that the pirate would never make back his costs.<br>
<p>
With current printing technology, absent copyright, the pirate's costs are<br>
much lower than the original publisher's, since he can use photo offset or<br>
something similar to free ride on the original publisher's layout,<br>
proofing, etc. So that method doesn't work.<br>
<p>
As this example suggests, whether alternatives to IP protection work, and<br>
how well, depends on details of the associated technology. Certainly there<br>
are alternatives. But I don't think one can say, a priori, whether relying<br>
on them will produce plenty of intellectual property, an inefficiently but<br>
not catastrophically low level, or practically none--it depends.<br>
<p>
On the subject of first mover advantages, my favorite quote is from<br>
Kipling's "Mary Gloster," possibly his best poem:<br>
<p>
"They asked me how I did it and I gave 'em the scripture text<br>
'You keep your light so shining a little ahead of the next,'<br>
They copied all they could copy, but they couldn't copy my mind,<br>
And I left them, sweating and stealing, a year and a half behind."<br>
<p>
On the economics of IP protection, people might be interested in my Dayton<br>
Law Review article on Standards, on my web page, and in the discussion of<br>
IP in the lecture notes for my L&amp;E course (current and last quarter's<br>
course visiting at Stanford), also on my web page.<br>

Lee Daniel Crocker writes:<br>
<p>
"But as Friedman and others have<br>
shown with more detailed economic analysis, the net gains are<br>
always less than the net losses, because a subsidy changes the<br>
relative value of the commodity subsidized, leading to inefficient<br>
trades in every business affected by that commodity."<br>
<p>
It's tricky in the copyright case. You get an inefficiently low level of<br>
production and consumption of those books that are written, since the price<br>
includes royalty although the marginal cost to the author of having one<br>
more copy sold is zero. But you move the number of books written closer to<br>
the efficient level, because you raise the reward to the people who bear<br>
the fixed cost of producing books (author and publisher) closer to its real<br>
value to the users. So you are losing on one margin and gaining on the<br>
other.<br>
<p>
In another post he writes:<br>
<p>
"I explained that quite clearly many times: if you sell me a product,<br>
then I use the ideas to create a similar one and sell that, then the<br>
government will step in and prevent me from doing so /at my expense/.<br>
Protecting a market at public expense is no less a subsidy than just<br>
writing checks from the public coffers or regulating prices."<br>
<p>
I think it is worth distinguishing two features of IP law--the fact that it<br>
protects certain things that may or may not seem like property, and the<br>
fact that enforcement is in part paid for by the government.<br>
<p>
Suppose we ignore, for a moment, the question of enforcement cost, and just<br>
ask whether the enforcement itself is a bad thing. One obvious answer is<br>
that IP is a substitute for contractual arrangements that most of us would<br>
approve of if it were practical to enforce them. An author could, after<br>
all, sell his book with an explicit shrink wrap license, binding the buyer<br>
not to reproduce the book, not to permit others to reproduce the book, and<br>
making the buyer liable for damages to the author if his copy does get<br>
reproduced, with or without his permission. If that contract could be<br>
enforced, it would be very much like copyright law. The practical problem<br>
is that when pirate copies get out there is usually no way of proving whose<br>
copy got pirated (a problem that may be soluble for some digital works,<br>
incidentally), and the guilty party, if located, may be judgement proof. So<br>
if one approves of the results that would be produced by such a contractual<br>
regime, if enforceable, it is hard to see why, from a consequentialist<br>
standpoint, one should reject the same results when produced by IP law.<br>
<p>
Now bring back in the issue of enforcement cost. Some of that is paid by<br>
the state under the current regime, but not much, since IP is almost<br>
entirely civil, meaning that the enforcement is done mostly at the<br>
plaintiff's expense, although possibly in a subsidized court. But that is<br>
equally true of ordinary property at present, so it isn't a special<br>
argument against IP.<br>

Someone resonding to someone quoted and wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Ah you show that you do not understand the economics of it. First off,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "fair use" has been declared legal, as is personal use, which is why you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; can make as many copies as you want, so long as you gain no commercial</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's your understandiing that's faulty here.  Lack of commerical use is</i><br>
<i>&gt;absolutely no defense.</i><br>
<p>
You don't automatically have a right to copy something for your personal<br>
use. But whether something counts as "fair use" depends on a bunch of<br>
different criteria, and a personal use would be more likely to pass the<br>
(very fuzzy) test than a commercial use. So it is some defense, just not by<br>
itself a sufficient defense.<br>

My friend and colleague at Santa Clara, Larry Iannaconne, specializes in<br>
the economic analysis of religion; you might want to look for some of his<br>
articles. I don't know if he has looked at the question of why religion<br>
exists, but he has looked at economic explanations for why religions have<br>
some of the characteristics they do.<br>
