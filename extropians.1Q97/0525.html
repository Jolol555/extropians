<i>&gt;Many Pacific islands are useful in that they demonstrate both the</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential and the limits of flying creatures to fill evolutionary niches</i><br>
<i>&gt;free of other animals. Given a lack of competition from apes or other</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligent creatures, birds were not able to develop any decent levels</i><br>
<i>&gt;of intelligence, mainly due to the limits of the mass fraction. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;weight restrictions of flight make large brains an evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;disadvantage.</i><br>
<p>
Ahh but what if the planet had less mass and thus less gravity to allow<br>
birds to acquire larger brains? You could easily come out with an<br>
earth-like planet where flying is more popular than walking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is also another interesting datum: brain case to cervical cavity</i><br>
<i>&gt;ratio. Find animals that have large cervical cavities, or find the</i><br>
<i>&gt;environmental pressures that lead to the development of such large</i><br>
<i>&gt;cavities, and you can develop an idea of what sort of creatures are</i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of givng birth to big brained offspring. Even for ourselves, we</i><br>
<i>&gt;need the fetus to have a brain case that is not fully developed yet in</i><br>
<i>&gt;order to give birth, so it can squeeze through.</i><br>
<p>
Does this mean that as we continue to evolve there will be far more<br>
premature born babies because with technology we can allow them to survive<br>
so the skull size can be larger? Eventually we will require technology to<br>
survive as a species if we don't alter our genes or upload.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We may even develop some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;symbiosis if our waste products are their resources and vice versa. Take</i><br>
<i>&gt;the H2S/H2O issue. Or take our relationship to plants.</i><br>
<p>
Wow. Talk about convergence of two entirely different streams of evolution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As we see with cetaceans with their incredible</i><br>
<i>&gt;auditory processing, able to 3d image an entire ocean in a few chirps,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they may have high brain to body mass ratios, but much of that brain</i><br>
<i>&gt;mass is wasted on signal processing.</i><br>
<p>
Could it be possible somehow to retrieve these maps and find valuable data<br>
on the changing structure of the ocean floor someday?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A true alien might not fit our detectors, and look so utterly different </i><br>
<i>&gt;that we will not immediately have a reaction. Imagine something that </i><br>
<i>&gt;looks like a glittering cloud with fractal shells - it is too weird </i><br>
<i>&gt;to mean anything to us. Of course, evolution might converge; if they </i><br>
<i>&gt;evolved on a planet it would be quite possible that they too have </i><br>
<i>&gt;articulated legs, for example. But we do not know if most aliens are from </i><br>
<i>&gt;planets... maybe most are eganesque polysaccharide carpets or vortex </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligences. </i><br>
<p>
Ahh but the one fear we know that will occur at the minimum is fear of the<br>
unknown, just as native american indians were afraid of the european's<br>
horses. I'm wondering if we will have the same response to an alien<br>
species. I wonder if we will find them disfigured if they are somewhat like<br>
us and our detectors pickup on a few bodily structures. It's funny how we<br>
are both curious and afraid of the unknown.<br>
