<i>&gt; From: Guru George </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Max, Max, you sound like a luddite, or the contemporary equivalent of one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of those guitar bores who used to object to synthesized music!  Have you</i><br>
<i>&gt; been out clubbing lately with your mates? </i><br>
<p>
I have been playing techno since '82 thank you. I just find it<br>
unimaginative to use synths &amp; samplers for nothing but dance. I club once<br>
in a while yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Have you taken any E or acid</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a club lately? </i><br>
<p>
NOPE<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You can have no idea what's going on with techno</i><br>
<i>&gt; nowadays unless you do. </i><br>
<p>
Must learn to live with that then. But you are a typical example of the<br>
"clubber" limiting the techno-scene to dance. The above statement shows<br>
just that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; DJ's are a very important part of this process, and their</i><br>
<i>&gt; job is not easy. The competition in techno music is FEROCIOUS.</i><br>
<p>
DJ's have only a very limited taste in music. To much of what is being<br>
called a genre in techno these days shouldn't have been more than an album.<br>
Most DJ's has no artistic taste whatsoever. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As Vonnegut said, 90% of everything is crap, and there is indeed a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of crap techno around.</i><br>
<p>
yep, but make that 99% of techno.<br>
<p>
I still love techo though, and it's what i listen to the most but i don't<br>
mind if it has lyrics with a meaning, has a message, pushes the edge<br>
somewhat and challenge me as a listener.<br>
