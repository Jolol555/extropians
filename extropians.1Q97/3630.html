I think that Gregory Houston responded to Sarah's post with great skill and<br>
erudition.  <br>
<p>
Also, some of Sarah's questions are answered, briefly yet cogently, in the<br>
Transhumanist and Extropic Art FAQ which can be read at my URL. Here I have<br>
stated by degrees how art can be considered extropic by the creative author<br>
as well as the audience.  <br>
<p>
Further, (and just a brief backtrack) Johnny had a problem with silicon and<br>
I think that has been dealt with quite efficiently. We learned that there is<br>
a difference between silicon and silicone, etc-;  I wouldn't say the<br>
suggestion was inept: it was not appropriate for flexible skin, but was<br>
appropriate for a stiff armour.  <br>
<p>
In discussions with my brothers (a plastic reconstructive surgeon and a<br>
internal medicine expert), I have been advised by their research of the<br>
development of and future interest in designing synthetic skins, where<br>
polymers are used.<br>
<p>
Now, to add to Gregory Houston's response, and to answer questions about the<br>
intent, articulation (rhetoric) of an artist (and this includes<br>
cross-disciplines), the following phrases I wrote define extropic art:<br>
<p>
Extropic art is produced by:<br>
<p>
"coalescing imagination and reason, challenging all limits."<br>
<p>
*Reason* is paramount.<br>
<p>
With the direction of:<br>
<p>
"...exploring how current and future technologies affect our senses, our<br>
cognition and our lives.  Our attention to and comprehension of these<br>
relationships become fields of art as we participate in the most immediate<br>
and vital issues for transhumanity ..."<br>
<p>
Paying attention to what sciences and technologies will help us to achieve<br>
our transhuman goals. Our comprehension means our *knowledge.*  <br>
<p>
And, <br>
<p>
"...utilizing high-end creativity, engineering skills, scientific data, and<br>
automated tools to author ..."<br>
<p>
This sums up the former:  Using creativity and reason while paying attention<br>
to and developing a knowledge of the science and technology that will help<br>
us to achieve our transhuman goals.<br>
<p>
Also:<br>
<p>
"We have no interest in focusing on self-defeating thinking or entropy."<br>
<p>
How we develop ideas determines the integrity of our work.<br>
<p>
Now, with the above information as the starting point for creative work,<br>
there is a continuous balance, just as there is in life and with every<br>
decision that we make, whether *art* or not.  Placing a censorship on art is<br>
like placing a censorship on life and your own values.  Are you not the<br>
judge of what you deem to best represent you and your actions?  Just as in<br>
science, one would like to be known as an authentic and reliable source of<br>
knowledge, an artist down the same, especially a scientist who sees his work<br>
as art.  (State of the art?)<br>
