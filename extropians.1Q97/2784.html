 Yes. Both Damien and Nadia's responses seem to assume that trade is <br>
 only about material objects and that human emotions are somehow not <br>
 subject to the principles of communication and economics that are <br>
 nicely summarized by the single word 'trade'. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, but the key to this statement lies in your wording:  "SEEM to assume" -<br>
but that is not what i assume. Trade *in itself* is a wonderful manifestation<br>
of a fair and equitable mind. It is rational. It allows for much pleasure and<br>
gain. Even more importantly, it is a great starting point for fixing and<br>
maintaining a boundary against altruism and selflessness in a society where<br>
self and individuality is sorely misvalued.<br>
<p>
Yet, still,  I think it has it's limits as far as human interplay is<br>
concerned, it cannot always be a guide, it's that "if all  you have is a<br>
hammer, everything looks like a nail"  thing again.. yet it is indeed a great<br>
tool for many situations, including some interpersonal ones; it need not be<br>
discarded in entirety, just becuase it is not always the most useful tool at<br>
the moment.<br>
<p>
I think communication and economy are but two of myriad activities we will<br>
engage in over our lifetimes... our long, long, lifetimes....<br>
