<i>                &gt;were much larger than the strike zone!                  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If the animals were much larger than that, then we can make 2 conclusions  <br>
about these hunters who were armed with nothing but rocks and tiny brains: <br>
1) They had a huge amount of courage. <br>
2) They did not leave a huge number of descendants<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;I very much doubt a hunting group got that many opportunities                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;to hit something in a day, certainly not as many throws as a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;baseball pitcher will make. </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Even with great natural ability baseball pitchers need to practice to be good <br>
at their job, they practice constantly until their arm wares out. If these <br>
hunters saved their arm and did not practice, how could they hope to hit  <br>
anything?             <br>
<p>

<i>                &gt;ran, but I think my point was that bipetalism was a                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;prerequisite for throwing. My point was how the big expansion                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;grew out of the earlier adaptions to projectile hunting which  </i><br>
<i>                &gt;a chimp sized brain could support.  </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Once bipedalism and a hand almost as good as ours was developed, the point <br>
Lucy was at, I don't find it all that mysterious that the brain grew very <br>
rapidly. Yes, it will help you with throwing, but with that good hand  <br>
intelligence will help you do a lot of other things too. What I don't  <br>
understand is why bipedalism developed and why Lucy evolved a first rate hand <br>
when she still had a third rate brain.<br>

I agree with that, I just have my doubts that a pre-human throwing a rock  <br>
would even be a good bluff, and as a offensive hunting weapon I think it <br>
would be hopeless.<br>
