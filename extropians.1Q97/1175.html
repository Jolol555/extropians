<i>&gt; &gt;Right now, I have given</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;those keys to a guy called "reason", because he has served me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well.  The vast torrent of concepts and percepts may compete</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;among themselves by any means available, but whatever winners</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;come to the gate of knowledge, only one test lets them in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now you're recycling the tired old dualistic homunculus theory of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness, except as a theory of epistemology rather than of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness. If I hadn't already dragged out the word "idol" I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would do so at this point.  This is not "reason", this is superstition!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Reason is a vast and glorious school, a tradition, a broad social</i><br>
<i>&gt; phenomenon, not some robot in your head.</i><br>
<p>
Come now, you know that I'm anthropomorphizing solely for rhetorical<br>
effect, not to exhalt dualism.  To use the Buddhist's terminology,<br>
I am pointing at the moon, and you keep looking at my finger.  If<br>
I can think of a better way to show it I will, but until then, I<br>
can only look at your words and say "that isn't it."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I have to show is all inside your head. I can't make you look</i><br>
<i>&gt; at it. If you want to go through life as a cognitive cripple with</i><br>
<i>&gt; half your brain chopped out because you will only listen to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of your brain that you have packaged up and labeled "reason",</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's not my loss. You have a whole brain, and you know very well</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there are large chunks of it which do not correspond to what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you call "reason" but which have had survival value for your</i><br>
<i>&gt; ancestors (or they wouldn't be there). I would not be so cavalier</i><br>
<i>&gt; about ignoring them as you seem to be.</i><br>
<p>
I never questioned the survival value of all those things other<br>
than what I call reason (which we'll just have to agree is /something/<br>
for now until I can come up with a better way to show it).  That<br>
evidence is clear: I have them, and I am here.  I can't ignore a<br>
plain fact like that, and I don't.  But I choose to invest more of<br>
my resources of time in the future, not the past, and I choose to<br>
believe that what I experience as free will is just that, so I want<br>
to free myself from the tyrrany of my genes.  I evolved for their<br>
benefit, but I now choose to evolve for /mine/, and I don't buy that<br>
the old rules of the former will lead me to the latter.  But no, I<br>
don't deny that I must use the machine they produced as it is for<br>
now until I can create a better one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And as for your claim that science does not produce knowledge, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a rhetorical flourish that showed up for the wrong argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not representing the logical positivist position here.  If we</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't discussing scientific knowledge, what precisely are we</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing? Theological knowledge? Your knowledge of your underwear</i><br>
<i>&gt; size? Bill Clinton's knowledge of economics?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, most of our disagreement here probably is just semantic.  Let me<br>
try some definitions: What I call "knowledge" is the subset of the<br>
state-information of my cognitive apparatus that serve to record,<br>
describe, and classify reality.  There also exist things like models,<br>
methods, principles, speculations, and other things that might fall<br>
under the common usage of the word, but I don't have a good word for<br>
that--maybe "knowledge context" or something?  Or what if we call <br>
those things knowledge and then call the former "facts"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Okay, so now you've backed down to the classic relativist position:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "it works for me". In that case, why are you going around verbally</i><br>
<i>&gt; attacking people for using more than *just* their reason? It works</i><br>
<i>&gt; for them, right? This much should be obvious.</i><br>
<p>
I won't back down quite that far: it's not just what works for /me/,<br>
it is my experience of what has worked for humankind throughout<br>
history, and what I believe will work to get us to the kind of<br>
future I want to live in.  If I have "attacked" anyone (which is a<br>
characterization I disagree with, but I'll let it stand for now), it<br>
is for using methods that I indentify from history as those that have<br>
failed to serve the purposes they apparently seek.  If they can<br>
convince me otherwise, I'm here listening (despite that you may think<br>
I am not).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If an honest expression causes someone to "close off" his mind, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that fact in itself is dangerous and needs to be dealt with.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is sheer sanctimony, Lee.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  So, what's your point?  That is is wrong to express ethical<br>
judgment?  Isn't that itself an expression of ethical judgment?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps you might better tending to</i><br>
<i>&gt; "dealing with" your own mind, rather than "dealing with" the minds of</i><br>
<i>&gt; others. Dangerous? What is dangerous about someone choosing not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; listen to a boorish, rude, sanctimonious, disrespectful lout? I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; sorry, but I can't see any danger in this. Actually, I think this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite healthy, especially if the lout in question is working for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government.</i><br>
<p>
If the boorish lout has some ideas worth examining, even if only to<br>
refute them, isn't choosing not listen dangerous?  Should I burn all<br>
the copies of Mein Kampf?  Supress the Communist Manifesto?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My chiefest charge was that your insulting mode of giving orders to</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people about how to organize the contents of their own minds is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to change any minds...</i><br>
<p>
I don't remember ever telling anyone what to do; I merely expressed<br>
my own evaluation of the ideas they presented.  If that evaluation is<br>
"mystical nonsense", then sobeit.  That's what I'll say.  Seems to me<br>
that you're the one telling people what to do: keep your judgments to<br>
yourself, be more considerate of other ideas, be polite at the expense<br>
of being honest.  Sorry, but I don't buy it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm personally annoyed with this (and you're getting the brunt of it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because you've</i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously been spoiling for a fight with someone) because whenever I let</i><br>
<i>&gt; people know that I'm a libertarian, I usually have to deal with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaction "Oh, you mean you're one of those sanctimonious know-it-all</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggressively rude Randroids?" And it is people who have been using the</i><br>
<i>&gt; style of argumentation that you recommend which create this reaction for</i><br>
<i>&gt; me. And people using the style of argumentation that you recommend have</i><br>
<i>&gt; done far more harm than good for the political causes that you and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; both support. Hence my anger.</i><br>
<p>
That may be a fair observation.  I don't really encounter that<br>
reaction much except on the net, because the only people with whom I<br>
discuss libertarian ideas are those that know me well, and know that<br>
I am personally kind, generous, tolerant . . . and opinionated.  I'm<br>
not really bothered at all by even the most "sanctimonious" Randroids<br>
(to use your term) so long as they are just expressing ideas.  I know<br>
some are, but the raw numbers show that the ideas are spreading well<br>
anyway.  I don't want to live in the kind of world where I can't be<br>
straightforward and honest, and I'm not convinced yet that lying (or<br>
"softening" my prose, or whatever euphemism you like) will help me<br>
get to the kind of world I want.  Maybe I will be, but I just don't<br>
see it yet.<br>
