<p>
To the contrary, one can meaningfully define "Extropian writing" so as to<br>
include writings that do not embody Extropian attitudes.  An anthropologist<br>
studying Extropian culture would almost certainly include in her sample set a<br>
variety of writings--such as those that routinely appear on this list--that<br>
constitute mere chatter or jest.  She could quite justifiably call these<br>
"Extropian writings", as they reveal much about Extropian culture (if not<br>
philosophy).<br>
<p>
(Note, however, that this does not imply that *anti-Extropian* writings must<br>
qualify as "Extropic writing" under a source-base definition.  I set aside<br>
that issue for now, recognizing it as problematic but no more so than<br>
potential disputes about whether or not an artwork embodies Extropian<br>
values.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Similarly, Extropic Art is art that embodies extropic ideas and values.</i><br>
<p>
This claim need not hold true under the source-based definition that I've<br>
described.  Extropic Art would, on such a view, win that label because it<br>
issues from people who call themselves Extropians.  Example:  I write<br>
instrumental music as a hobby.  An anthropologist might well include such<br>
music in a collection of "Extropic Art", even though it carries no particular<br>
message.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Regardless of views on this, it seems perfectly clear to me that Extropic</i><br>
<i>&gt;Art *does* admit of definition and understanding. Such a definition need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;go into details, but to avoid some kind of definition is obfuscating and</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystifying -- certainly *not* extropic traits!</i><br>
<p>
Oh, I agree absolutely.  The point of my comments has been to offer an<br>
alternative  approach to the problem of defining Extropic art.  A<br>
source-based definition can give fairly clear boundaries, I think, and avoids<br>
mystification.  Nonetheless, I for now remain agnostic about whether one<br>
ought to embrace a content-, intent-, or source-based definition.  It suffices<br>
, for present purposes, to understand that "define it by content or not at<br>
all!" constitutes a false dichotomy.<br>
